          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,487\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:13,575\nThis show on ITProTV covers\nthe Microsoft 70-687 exam,\n\n3\n00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:17,720\nwhich is for the, the Windows 8 MCSA.\n\n4\n00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,170\nThe MCSA is the MIcrosoft certified\nsolutions associate and it's designed to\n\n5\n00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,250\nbe a mid level certification for I.T.\nSystems Administrators.\n\n6\n00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,278\nIf you work in an environment where\nyou support Windows 8 desktops or\n\n7\n00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:35,400\nWindows 8 machines just deployed in\nany manner inside your organization.\n\n8\n00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,970\nWell, that's what this\ncertification is designed for.\n\n9\n00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,180\nThere is more than one MCSA\nthat's out there though.\n\n10\n00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,470\nThere is the MCSA for\ndesktop infrastructure,\n\n11\n00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,860\nwhich is what pertains to Windows 8.\n\n12\n00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,680\nThere's also the MCSA for\nserver infrastructure,\n\n13\n00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,124\nwhich pertains to Windows Server 2012.\n\n14\n00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:52,776\nSo you have to make sure you're\ngoing down the right track for\n\n15\n00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:56,380\nyour certification based on the job\nrole that you're going to perform.\n\n16\n00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,050\nSo if you're someone who works\non servers quite a bit well,\n\n17\n00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,440\nthe 7687 exam is not, necessarily,\n\n18\n00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,510\none that's going to line up with\nthe certifications you need to pursue.\n\n19\n00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,700\nSo before we dive into\nthis one specifically,\n\n20\n00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,890\nlet's just take a look at that full track.\n\n21\n00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,590\nI've got pulled up here\nMicrosoft's website for\n\n22\n00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,430\nthe Microsoft Certified\nSolutions Associate,\n\n23\n00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,530\nand you'll see all\nthe different tracks they have.\n\n24\n00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,655\nThe MCSA server for\nWindows 2008 as well 2012.\n\n25\n00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:24,997\nWe've got the Windows 8 and Windows 7\nas well as some of the SQL Server and\n\n26\n00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:28,350\neven Microsoft Office 365 certifications.\n\n27\n00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,730\nEach of these are different tracks.\n\n28\n00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,530\nThey all lead to you attaining a MCSA,\nall right.\n\n29\n00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,260\nSo you really have the MCSA with its\nvarious specializations underneath it.\n\n30\n00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,080\nIf you want to work with servers,\nyou'll want to jump into the server track.\n\n31\n00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,700\nFor Windows 8 though, we've got this\nguy right here, the MCSA in Windows 8.\n\n32\n00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,510\nTo get your MCSA, you actually\nneed to complete two exams, so\n\n33\n00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,980\nit's two exams to one certification.\n\n34\n00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,600\nBut the exams are very closely related.\n\n35\n00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,640\nThe first one is this show,\n\n36\n00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,652\nconfiguring Windows 8.1 which\nlines up with the 70-87 exam.\n\n37\n00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:04,270\nAnd that exam covers all sorts\nof information pertaining to\n\n38\n00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,000\nactually setting up and\ninstalling, deploying Windows 8.\n\n39\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,600\nSo how do we get our environment up and\nrunning using Windows 8?\n\n40\n00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,119\nOnce you've completed and, and passed\nthat exam, you move onto the next one,\n\n41\n00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,286\nwhich is supporting Windows 8.1.\n\n42\n00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,870\nAll right, now you've got\nWindows 8 in your environment.\n\n43\n00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,200\nHow do keep it running smoothly?\n\n44\n00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,080\nHow do you trouble shoot issues and\nresolve problems?\n\n45\n00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,503\nHow do you maintain your environment,\nall right?\n\n46\n00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:31,960\nAnd that's the 70-688 exam,\nthe sister course to this one.\n\n47\n00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,859\nBut let's take a look at that 687 exam,\nbecause that's what this show is about.\n\n48\n00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,060\nAll right.\n\n49\n00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,005\nThe 7687 exam, like most Microsoft exams,\ncosts $150 to take, so it's not a terribly\n\n50\n00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:46,116\nexpensive exam, except you've gotta\ntake two of them to get the MCSA, right.\n\n51\n00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:48,510\nSo you've got about $300 in exam costs.\n\n52\n00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,230\nThat's United States dollars\nyour currency may vary.\n\n53\n00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,810\nBut the exam itself is\npretty straightforward.\n\n54\n00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,260\nYou can take it at any Pearson Vue\ntesting center located around the world,\n\n55\n00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,728\nif you've never tested with them\nbefore check out their website.\n\n56\n00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:06,321\nGo to www.pearsonvue,\nV-U-E .com/microsoft and\n\n57\n00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:10,020\nyou can sign up for an account with them.\n\n58\n00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,090\nLocate a testing center near you,\nthere's normally one near by,\n\n59\n00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,580\nand then you can go and\ntake the exam whenever you schedule.\n\n60\n00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,600\nBut for getting ready for the exam,\nwell that's where our content comes in.\n\n61\n00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,030\nAll right,\nnow who is this one designed for?\n\n62\n00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,440\nWell, it's designed for somebody\nwho's gonna be working in a business\n\n63\n00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,590\nthat is going to be supporting Windows 8.\n\n64\n00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,840\nIf you're a home user, your gonna learn\nabout a lot of technologies in this\n\n65\n00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,720\nshow that aren't useful at home.\n\n66\n00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,240\nIn fact, will make your life\na lot more difficult at home,\n\n67\n00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,930\nbecause they're technologies\ndesigned to support hundreds or\n\n68\n00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,060\nthousands of systems,\nnot to support five systems.\n\n69\n00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,410\nRight?\nYou'll find that if you use\n\n70\n00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,610\nthe technologies we discuss in this show\nat home, it will make things take a lot\n\n71\n00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,882\nlonger than they should when you could\nhave just gone and done it manually.\n\n72\n00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:55,810\nAll right, so we're really gonna focus\non automating and repeating activities,\n\n73\n00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,380\nbecause at home, you might just\ninstall Windows 8 on one machine, but\n\n74\n00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,450\nat your office, you might install\nWindows 8 on 500 machines.\n\n75\n00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,460\nAnd you don't want to do\nit 500 separate times.\n\n76\n00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,960\nSo if we can script it,\n\n77\n00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,680\nautomate it, deploy an image that\nhas everything set the way we want,\n\n78\n00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,912\nit saves a ton of time and it's absolutely\nworth it in a corporate environment.\n\n79\n00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:16,580\nAll right so let's take a look\nat what's covered on this exam.\n\n80\n00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,110\nThe exam's broken up into seven\ndifferent topic areas and\n\n81\n00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,800\nthe the font here is kind of small.\n\n82\n00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,680\nLet me zoom in on that a little bit.\n\n83\n00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,990\nAnd we can kind of run down the list here.\n\n84\n00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,670\nWe start with simply installing and\nupgrading to Windows 8.1.\n\n85\n00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,600\nAnd I know what you're saying.\n\n86\n00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600\nAll right Don, I pop in a disc and I click\nnext 20 times and we're done, right.\n\n87\n00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,930\nThat is how a normal installation will go,\nbut for\n\n88\n00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,120\nthis one we will cover\nthe automation piece.\n\n89\n00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,020\nHow can we deploy Windows 8 over the\nnetwork without even having a disc at all.\n\n90\n00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,780\nHow can we have our own line\nof business applications\n\n91\n00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,520\nall ready installed when Windows\n8 comes up the first time.\n\n92\n00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,640\nHow can we make things as\nautomatic as possible?\n\n93\n00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,370\nSo you get a chance to see that as well\nas some of the other concerns with\n\n94\n00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,180\nupgrading to Windows 8.1.\n\n95\n00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,410\nThen we'll see configuring hardware and\n\n96\n00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,530\napplications, most systems have\na fairly common set of hardware.\n\n97\n00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,480\nBut there's always these extra devices\nthat people bring in that we may need to\n\n98\n00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,730\nload custom configurations for, and we'll\nget a chance to see how all that works.\n\n99\n00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,510\nNext is the networking side.\n\n100\n00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,300\nWindows 8 is a fully network\naware operating system,\n\n101\n00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,960\nwhich is not really new for it.\n\n102\n00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,602\nBut that means that it,\nit doesn't just support it, but\n\n103\n00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:24,092\nactually expect to have\na connection to the network.\n\n104\n00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:28,270\nFor things like automatic updates and\neasy search functionality and, and\n\n105\n00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,260\nusing your Microsoft Live ID to\nsynchronize account settings.\n\n106\n00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,390\nThat stuff all requires\na network configuration.\n\n107\n00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,910\nSo we'll take a look at how to set\nup the networking under Windows 8?\n\n108\n00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,230\nTo get the machines to talk together.\n\n109\n00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,050\nThen, configuring\nthe access to our networks.\n\n110\n00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,520\nIf we start to share things like files,\nfolders,\n\n111\n00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,700\nprinters, we probably wanna control who\ncan get to what, and who can do what?\n\n112\n00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,440\nSo we'll see some of the different\ntechnologies that are available there to\n\n113\n00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,720\ncontrol access to our system.\n\n114\n00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,530\nThen we've got remote access and mobility.\n\n115\n00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,230\nSo today we're going to learn about\nthings like VPNs and dial-up connections.\n\n116\n00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,980\nHopefully, you don't have to use dial-up\nanymore but VPN is very commonly used,\n\n117\n00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,000\nas well as other mobile technologies\nlike tablet computing, right.\n\n118\n00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,690\nWindows 8 has that two different versions,\n\n119\n00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,910\nthe normal Windows 8 and\nthen the Windows 8 RT or just Windows RT.\n\n120\n00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,129\nAnd so we talk a little bit about\nthat not, not a ton on Windows RT.\n\n121\n00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,169\nBut we also discuss some of\nthe differences with mobile platforms in\n\n122\n00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,500\ngeneral, like supporting battery life,\nright.\n\n123\n00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,270\nYou don't have a battery in a desktop\nPC to worry about, but in a laptop or\n\n124\n00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,150\na tablet, you do.\n\n125\n00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,710\nNext we talk about monitoring and\nmaintaining Windows clients.\n\n126\n00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,590\nNow, this is a small portion on\nmaintaining the clients because the next\n\n127\n00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,170\nexam goes into great depth on it.\n\n128\n00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,560\nAnd then at the very end we've got\nsystem and data recovery options.\n\n129\n00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,070\nWhen you deploy Windows 8,\nyou need to have something in\n\n130\n00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,150\nplace to be able to back it up, and\nrestore in the event of failure.\n\n131\n00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,090\nAnd that's kind of how we round\noff those topics as we cover,\n\n132\n00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,270\nhow to safely back up and\nrestore your system?\n\n133\n00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,620\nIt's really good knowledge, all of this\nis, and most of it, you'll turn around and\n\n134\n00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,350\nuse in your environment.\n\n135\n00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,590\nWhat I find a lot of people do\nis they go through all of this,\n\n136\n00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,390\nthey learn the different options that\nare out there, and then they pick and\n\n137\n00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,200\nchoose the ones they want to\ndeploy in their organization.\n\n138\n00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,420\nBut you don't know what to use, if you\ndon't know what all is out there and\n\n139\n00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,160\nthat's what this certi,\ncertification is designed for.\n\n140\n00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,070\nI find that all in all,\nit's a pretty fair exam.\n\n141\n00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,200\nThe, the examination contents,\nit can be a lot, right?\n\n142\n00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,580\nIt's a lot of content, but\nthe exam's pretty straightforward and\n\n143\n00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,950\nMicrosoft doesn't normally get\ntoo tricky on their exams.\n\n144\n00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,160\nSo if you're gonna be going to work in\na medium or large organization, and\n\n145\n00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,850\nyou're going to be deploying Windows 8.\n\n146\n00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,560\nThis is a great certification again, it's\njust a great set of knowledge to have,\n\n147\n00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,300\neven if you don't go on to do\nthe certification, all right.\n\n148\n00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,670\nIf your environment is all Windows 7,\nit's still useful to learn Windows 8,\n\n149\n00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,740\nbecause eventually you may go to it or\nmaybe you'll skip over Windows 8, and\n\n150\n00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,360\nyou'll just go straight to Windows 10.\n\n151\n00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,340\nWell, Windows 10 is building off of\na lot of the Window 8 technologies.\n\n152\n00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,580\nSo if you skip over an OS,\nyou're gonna be behind an eight ball.\n\n153\n00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,810\nYou've got a lot more knowledge to make up\nfor the changes between the two systems.\n\n154\n00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,480\nBut if you learn Windows 8 in between, now\nyou're that much closer to being ready for\n\n155\n00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,240\nWindows 10.\n\n156\n00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,480\nSo it's always a good idea to\nlearn the new operating system,\n\n157\n00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,590\neven if they're not that popular, right?\n\n158\n00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,515\nLike Windows Vista.\n\n159\n00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:14,330\n[LAUGH] So, so we definitely\nkeep that in mind as we go and\n\n160\n00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,240\nselect our certifications.\n\n161\n00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,380\nNow if you are interested\nin learning about servers\n\n162\n00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,740\nthis is not the certification for you.\n\n163\n00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,700\nThis is the MCSA for\n\n164\n00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,150\nwindows 8, you need to look into\nthe MCSA for Windows server 2012, right.\n\n165\n00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,800\nThat's going to steer you in the server\nside and maybe you want to do both right.\n\n166\n00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,500\nIt's not that many exams to go and\nget the MCSA in both and now, you know,\n\n167\n00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,430\nthe server and desktop side, and\nthat make you a very powerful person.\n\n168\n00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,810\nAs far as being attractive\nto a company to hire or\n\n169\n00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,660\njust being able to\nsupport the environment.\n\n170\n00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,590\nYou'll better understand\nthe interaction between client and, and\n\n171\n00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,710\nserver if you know\nthe configurations of both, right.\n\n172\n00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,230\nSo there's a lot of\nbenefits doing both sides.\n\n173\n00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,040\nAll right, so\nif that sounds like what you wanna learn,\n\n174\n00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,930\nthe certification you're looking to get,\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n175\n00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,640\nStay tuned.\n\n176\n00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,910\nWe'll have more Windows 8\nepisodes coming up soon.\n\n177\n00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,750\nBut if you're looking for servers or\nif you're just starting in IT, right.\n\n178\n00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,710\nYou haven't even gotten your feet wet yet.\n\n179\n00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,420\nThis isn't the greatest starting point for\nyou.\n\n180\n00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,960\nYou're looking to learn about servers,\nthere's the MCSA for Windows Server.\n\n181\n00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,720\nAnd if you're just getting started,\nwell you might want to take a look\n\n182\n00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,580\nat our Microsoft Technology Associate,\nthe MTA certification.\n\n183\n00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,920\nIt starts out with Windows 7 and covers\nthe basic of operating system deployment.\n\n184\n00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,470\nIs a much better place to start at if\nthis is your first IT Certification.\n\n185\n00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,130\nHowever, the MTA knowledge is,\nis pretty basic.\n\n186\n00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,220\nSo if you've working with Windows for\na little while,\n\n187\n00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,950\nyou might get kind of bored in that one.\n\n188\n00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,550\nAnd you certainly are able to just skip\nover it and come straight to the MCSA.\n\n189\n00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,760\nThat's what a lot of people do,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n190\n00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,860\nAs you go to select your certification.\n\n191\n00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,770\nAll right, well if you're sticking\nwith us for the MCSA Windows 8,\n\n192\n00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,380\nthen I'll see you in the next episode.\n\n193\n00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,710\nIf not, browse the rest of\nthe certification collection.\n\n194\n00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,420\nI think you'll find one certification or,\nor more that are,\n\n195\n00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,880\nare kind of more in line\nwith what your needs are.\n\n196\n00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,920\nAnd if you can't determine where to start?\n\n197\n00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,360\nJust ask, you can always shoot\nan email to support@itpro.tv or\n\n198\n00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,030\nemail me at Don@itpro.tv.\n\n199\n00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,260\nYou'll probably get a faster response from\nsupport, but just reach out to us and\n\n200\n00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,000\nwe'll help you.\n\n201\n00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,680\nWe can give you advice,\nsuggestions on where to start, you know,\n\n202\n00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680\nit's what we do here.\n\n203\n00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,332\nSo take advantage of that, we're,\nwe're always ready to answer questions.\n\n204\n00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:21,390\nAll right, well for those of you getting\nready to learn, we're about to start.\n\n205\n00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,641\nFor the rest of you,\ngood luck in your certification.\n\n206\n00:10:24,641 -->

back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,270\nI am your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,490\n>> Nathan Copeland.\n\n6\n00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,130\nThanks Don\n>> Yep.\n\n7\n00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,795\n>> For having me here.\n\n8\n00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:22,020\n>> [LAUGH] I got Nate back with me today.\n\n9\n00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,700\nFor those of you that tuned in on Friday,\nyou got to see.\n\n10\n00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,370\nNate who is normally our producer,\nis kinda making that transition into\n\n11\n00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,926\nthe exciting in front of the camera world,\nwhich.\n\n12\n00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:34,800\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it's\n\n13\n00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,060\na lot different from\nbeing behind the cameras.\n\n14\n00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,500\nBut it's nice, with all the lights,\nand I get to be with you, Don.\n\n15\n00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,335\n>> Oh, yeah, that's very sweet,\nwe can hold hands.\n\n16\n00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,970\n[LAUGH] So So today,\n\n17\n00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,320\nwe are officially kicking off\nour Windows 8 show, right?\n\n18\n00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,460\n>> Yeah, first day.\n\n19\n00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,640\n>> So, prior to now, for\nthose of you tuning in for the first time,\n\n20\n00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,200\nprior to now,\nwe've really been doing all CompTIA stuff.\n\n21\n00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,490\nAnd now we're making that transition\nover to the Microsoft world, right?\n\n22\n00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,220\nSo we're starting off with\nthe brand spanking new Microsoft\n\n23\n00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,520\n>> Windows 8?\n\n24\n00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,980\n>> MCSA, right, the\n>> MCSA.\n\n25\n00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,480\n>> MCSA Windows 8.\n\n26\n00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,800\nNow you might ask yourself,\n\n27\n00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,190\nwait a minute why are these guys\nstumbling over the certification name?\n\n28\n00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,390\nAnd the reason is, because Microsoft\nkeeps changing the thing, you know, and\n\n29\n00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,940\nit does get frustrating, so\nit is the MCSA Windows8,\n\n30\n00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,410\nif you caught it when they first\nannounced it back in October of 2012,\n\n31\n00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,800\nit was the MCSA desktop infrastructure,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,322\nAnd then now they've kinda shifted all\nthat around, so this is the MCSA Windows8.\n\n33\n00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:45,225\n[LAUGH] And particularly we're\nfocusing in on the first exam, right?\n\n34\n00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:48,680\nCause there's two exams if you're\ngoing to get certified in this you've\n\n35\n00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,420\ngotta do the 70 dash 687 exam and\nthe 70 dash 688.\n\n36\n00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,360\n>> That's right,\nI was going to say the 688, but.\n\n37\n00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,195\n>> I jumped in.\n\n38\n00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:57,740\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n39\n00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,840\nso that's basically what we're\ngoing to be kicking off.\n\n40\n00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,910\nAnd Nate, I just want to start kinda\ntalking a little bit about the MCSA and\n\n41\n00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,280\nwhat we have to do to get certified and\nthen we'll jump into the content.\n\n42\n00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,000\n>> All right.\n>> Sound good?\n\n43\n00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,010\n>> Yeah, that works.\n\n44\n00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,850\n>> Okay.\n\n45\n00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,830\nSo one of the things that I like to do and\na smarter me would have pulled it up\n\n46\n00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,550\nbefore the show started, but I'm going\nto pull up the Microsoft page here for\n\n47\n00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,700\nthe MCSA in Windows 8 so we can see it.\n\n48\n00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,100\nAnd there we go.\n\n49\n00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,730\nJason I'm queuing this up on my machine.\n\n50\n00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,802\n>> Perfect.\n\n51\n00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:34,180\n>> All right, so\nthis is Microsoft's webpage for\n\n52\n00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,750\nthe MCSA in Windows 8 and\nyou can see the name there.\n\n53\n00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,680\nNow MCSA used to stand for\n\n54\n00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,050\nMicrosoft Certified Systems Administrator\nand there was some various stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,330\nSome legalities and\n\n56\n00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,040\nissues in other countries with the old\nnaming conventions and so they changed it.\n\n57\n00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,570\nAnd now it's the Microsoft\nCertified Solutions Associate.\n\n58\n00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,410\nIn Windows 8.\n\n59\n00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,550\nNow what does that mean to us?\n\n60\n00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,470\nNot all that much in the general\nscheme of things, right?\n\n61\n00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,040\n>> Mm hm.\n>> So if somebody were to go out and get\n\n62\n00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,770\ncertified and become an MCSA in Windows 8,\nwhat does that qualify them for, right?\n\n63\n00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,650\nSo desktop administrator.\n\n64\n00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n65\n00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,280\nHelp stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,801\n>> Help stuff.\n\n67\n00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,430\n[LAUGH]\n>> Help support and\n\n68\n00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,200\nin Windows 8 and desktop support and yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,030\n>> Yeah.\nSo we usually see like if you're\n\n70\n00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,980\njust starting out in IT, people normally\ngo for their CompTIA plus first,\n\n71\n00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,040\nwhich is like a hardware fix basic\ndesktop support type certification.\n\n72\n00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,020\nBut it is fairly vendor neutral,\nit does all lot of Windows 7 these days.\n\n73\n00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,700\nBut this certification\nthe MCSA on Windows 8.\n\n74\n00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,630\nThat really gets you geared up on\nall the fancy stuff that we can\n\n75\n00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,920\ndo behind the scenes in Windows.\n\n76\n00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,280\nAnd makes you ready to do help desk,\n\n77\n00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,470\nif that's where you're going to do desktop\nadministrator, desktop engineer type work.\n\n78\n00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,820\n>> Yeah and get Windows 8\nworking with other Windows 8 PCs\n\n79\n00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,170\n>> Absolutely, yeah.\n\n80\n00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,230\nYou know,\nthere are the server certifications but\n\n81\n00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,200\nyou learn a little bit of the server side\nright here in the regular Windows stuff,\n\n82\n00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,090\nin the Windows 8 stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,900\nAll right, but you can see here\non Microsoft's page how they\n\n84\n00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,030\nreference the two different exams\nthat you need to do, right?\n\n85\n00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,160\nSo we've got the 70-C 687 that' what Nate\nand I are going to be covering today.\n\n86\n00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,975\nAnd you've got the 70 dash 688 which is\nwhat we'll start after this is over right?\n\n87\n00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:21,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So then we'll just keep kind of going\n\n88\n00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,150\nthrough and then we'll actually continue\non into the MCSE stuff over the next few\n\n89\n00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,210\nwell the next few months I imagine.\n\n90\n00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:28,990\n>> Nice.\n\n91\n00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,915\n>> Long term planning right?\n\n92\n00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:31,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n93\n00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,590\n>> All right, so if you want to get\ncertified, you do have to pass both exams.\n\n94\n00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,240\nRight?\n\n95\n00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,360\n>> Yes.\n>> If you just pass\n\n96\n00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,270\nyour 76/87, what do you get?\n\n97\n00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,270\n>> Nothing.\n\n98\n00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,160\n>> A whole lot of nothing.\n\n99\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,090\n>> You get the bragging\nrights of passing exam, but\n\n100\n00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,060\nyou don't a piece of paper, nothing.\n\n101\n00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,210\nCertificate,\n>> Do they still do the paper?\n\n102\n00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,220\n>> I don't know.\n\n103\n00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,030\nI logged into Microsoft\na little while ago to check for\n\n104\n00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,330\nmine and there was some error or whatnot.\n\n105\n00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,192\n>> Nice.\n>> So yeah,\n\n106\n00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:04,500\nI don't know what it looks like.\n\n107\n00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,050\n>> Use to be when you got certified with\nMicrosoft, they'd send you a welcome kit.\n\n108\n00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,840\nAnd it had a certificate,\n\n109\n00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,010\nit had a pin and an identification\ncard and a secret decoder ring.\n\n110\n00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,400\n>> Oh nice.\n>> I might be making that part up.\n\n111\n00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,341\nBut the rest of it's true.\n\n112\n00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,209\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you used to get all that not they've\n\n113\n00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:23,970\nkind of gone green or they've gone\n>> Uncost conscious.\n\n114\n00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,508\nAnd now you get a PDF.\n\n115\n00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:27,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Actually, not even that.\n\n116\n00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,422\nIt's an XPS of your certificate,\nso, yeah, so that's what you get.\n\n117\n00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:37,260\nAll righ, well,\nodds are if you're watching this show,\n\n118\n00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,940\nyou already know what the MCSA is and\nyou know you want to get it, and\n\n119\n00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,670\nthat's why you're watching\nthe show in the first place, so\n\n120\n00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,070\nI don't want to waste anymore\ntime talking about that,\n\n121\n00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,830\nlet's jump into the good's, right?\n\n122\n00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,740\nDo you have anything else to\nthrown in before we do that?\n\n123\n00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,370\n>> No.\n\n124\n00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,870\nI'm good.\n\n125\n00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,100\n>> So,\nlet's jump into the real deal here and\n\n126\n00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,260\ntake a look what we need to know for\nthe certification, right.\n\n127\n00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,290\nLet me just start\n\n128\n00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,810\nwith a quick overview of the objectives\nthat we have to tackle, right?\n\n129\n00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,718\nSo, Microsoft publishes right on their\nwebpage, if I were to go back to it,\n\n130\n00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,180\nWhat we're expected to know\nto pass the Windows 8 exam,\n\n131\n00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,048\nand so I'm just going to go\nhere to skills measured, and\n\n132\n00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:20,076\nbasically they break it all up into a\nseries of objectives and what we're going\n\n133\n00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:23,580\nto start with today is the fun one\ninstall and upgrade to Windows 8.\n\n134\n00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,080\n>> Yep.\n\n135\n00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,330\nSo, in that one, we're just,\nwe're doing the most important thing,\n\n136\n00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,390\nwhich is to get Windows 8 up and running.\n\n137\n00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,680\nIt's hard to use it if it's not running,\nright?\n\n138\n00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,500\nSo, that's what we're\ngoing to tackle there.\n\n139\n00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,000\nBut then we'll continue on\nas the series progresses.\n\n140\n00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,400\nWe're not going to get\nthrough all this today,\n\n141\n00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,100\nbelieve me it's going\nto take many episodes.\n\n142\n00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,950\nAs we go through configuring our hardware,\ngetting that set up and our applications.\n\n143\n00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,230\nConfiguring network connectivity, right?\n\n144\n00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,820\nWhich is what Nate mentioned.\n\n145\n00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,350\n>> Yep, configure access to resources.\n\n146\n00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,560\nOnce you get on the network,\nnow you can access stuff there.\n\n147\n00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,860\n>> Stuff, and by stuff we mean printers,\nstorage devices,\n\n148\n00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,950\nany of the crazy junk that\nwe might have out there.\n\n149\n00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,005\n>> I guess I'm generalizing a little bit.\n\n150\n00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:07,020\n>> [LAUGH] People are like,\noh yeah the stuff.\n\n151\n00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,230\nGotta access the stuff.\n\n152\n00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,400\nWhen I hear stuff,\nI always think of Oreo Stuffed.\n\n153\n00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,420\nThat's what they call the\n>> Double stuffed\n\n154\n00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,990\n>> Yeah, see.\n\n155\n00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,770\nAnyhow, you can connect your\nWindows 8 to your Oreo cookies.\n\n156\n00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,450\n>> With some milk.\n\n157\n00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,560\n>> Every show, I always say,\nman, I need to go and\n\n158\n00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,230\nlook up what brands were allowed to\nmention and not allowed to mention because\n\n159\n00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,390\none of these days were going to get\na cease and desist from the Oreo people.\n\n160\n00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,670\nStop slandering out cookies!\n\n161\n00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,030\nAnyhow.\n\n162\n00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,850\nSo, then we've got configuring\na remote access and mobility.\n\n163\n00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,960\nRight?\nIf you're on a laptop,\n\n164\n00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,770\nif you're traveling.\n\n165\n00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,720\nWhat you've got there.\n\n166\n00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,820\n>> That's a big one.\n\n167\n00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,100\nLot of good stuff in that one.\n\n168\n00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,220\n>> A lot of new stuff, right?\n\n169\n00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,630\nWindows 8 really, really increased things.\n\n170\n00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,490\nAnd that's something I didn't think\nto mention earlier was if you already\n\n171\n00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,650\nhave your MCSA, well you didn't\nhave a MCSA in Windows 7 right.\n\n172\n00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,894\nSo if you have your MCTS in Windows 7,\n\n173\n00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:59,552\nthere is some overlap between\nthe old stuff and the new exams.\n\n174\n00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:01,828\nThere is a lot of new\nstuff in Windows 8 too.\n\n175\n00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,067\n>> That's correct.\n\n176\n00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:08,227\nWe have a monitor and\nmaintain Windows Clients, right?\n\n177\n00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:14,711\nSo, your basic maintenance and\npreventative stuff, things don't work.\n\n178\n00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:17,750\nThen you can get in there and\nfigure it out.\n\n179\n00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,790\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n180\n00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,170\nWhat I like to say is, most of the class\nis focused, most of the class,\n\n181\n00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,331\nmost of the show is focused on how\nthings work when they're working\n\n182\n00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,285\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n183\n00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:29,942\nRight?\nBut\n\n184\n00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,920\nwe all know you get out there in\nthe field and things go south.\n\n185\n00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,046\nSo monitoring and maintaining is how do\nwe make sure that things stay running and\n\n186\n00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:40,335\nstay working the way they're supposed to.\n\n187\n00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:43,817\nAnd lastly, probably the most\nimportant section of the class,\n\n188\n00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:45,825\nI keep saying class, hey students.\n\n189\n00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,741\n>> Yeah, yeah, where are you?\n\n190\n00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:49,715\n>> It's like I'm in an auditorium.\n\n191\n00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:50,817\n>> Yeah.\n\n192\n00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:55,519\n>> Anyhow, the most important part of the\nseries is configuring backup and recovery.\n\n193\n00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,215\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n194\n00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:57,575\n>> Why is that important?\n\n195\n00:08:57,575 --> 00:08:59,454\n>> So we can keep our stuff.\n\n196\n00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:00,556\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n197\n00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,244\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, or get our stuff back.\n\n198\n00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:05,750\n>> So if you do have things\nreally seriously break,\n\n199\n00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,770\nyou need to be able to recover from that,\nand that's what that module is.\n\n200\n00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n201\n00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,082\n>> Sweet\n\n202\n00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:10,910\n>> All right, so,\n\n203\n00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,610\nthat's kind of what we got laid out,\n\n204\n00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,740\nand that's kind of the boring,\nbureaucratic, technical, whatever, stuff.\n\n205\n00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,686\nLet's get to some fun stuff.\n\n206\n00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:19,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n207\n00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,193\n>> All right?\n\n208\n00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:20,930\n>> Yep.\nSounds good.\n\n209\n00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,050\nNow, all right, so,\nthis first objective, right, so\n\n210\n00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,340\nit starts off with evaluate hardware and\nreadiness.\n\n211\n00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,547\nRight?\nBut before we get into that,\n\n212\n00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:34,725\nwhy don't we talk about\nwhat's new to Windows 8?\n\n213\n00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:37,600\nSo things that we can look\nforward to as we go throughout.\n\n214\n00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,486\n>> Sure.\nSo, if your already experienced in Windows\n\n215\n00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:44,992\n7, certified or not, maybe you've\nbeen working on Windows 7 a lot,\n\n216\n00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,960\nthere is a good bit of overlap.\n\n217\n00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,870\nAnd so you might be asking yourself, what\ndo I really need to watch out for, right?\n\n218\n00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,340\nWell, it is that new stuff that's\nout there that I need to hone in on.\n\n219\n00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,840\nAnd there's quite a bit, right?\n\n220\n00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,330\nWell, I don't wanna get you out of order.\n\n221\n00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,780\nWhat were you thinking before\nI jumped in with something?\n\n222\n00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,640\n>> Well, the biggest thing I think,\nnew to Windows 8, right, the Start screen.\n\n223\n00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,190\nRight?\n\n224\n00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,395\nThe biggest change to Windows since 95,\nright, with the little Start menu.\n\n225\n00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:12,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n226\n00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,410\n>> And so now that the menu's gone,\nthe button's kind of in limbo.\n\n227\n00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,230\nIt's on its way back.\n\n228\n00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,340\nBut yeah,\nthe Start screen's a tile interface.\n\n229\n00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,600\nRight?\nWhere you would launch your modern-style\n\n230\n00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,420\nWindows apps, these full-screen apps.\n\n231\n00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,980\nAnd it's kind of like the Start menu,\nbut it takes up the entire thing.\n\n232\n00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,100\n>> Yeah, and let's just show them\nreal quick so they can get an idea.\n\n233\n00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,060\nHere on my machine, if I bring up my\nStart menu, if I hit the little Windows\n\n234\n00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,950\nkey on my keyboard, instead of\ngetting a Start menu that appears,\n\n235\n00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,790\nI get the Start screen, the entire\nscreen that shows my applications and\n\n236\n00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,250\nvarious things that are running.\n\n237\n00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,446\nThis is a big departure\nfrom the old Start menu.\n\n238\n00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,419\nAnd not everybody's a big fan of it.\n\n239\n00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,405\nRight?\nIt just takes two seconds of Google\n\n240\n00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:06,170\nsearching to find millions of\ncomplaints about the new Start screen.\n\n241\n00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,080\nBut if you go back in time,\npeople did the same thing about Windows\n\n242\n00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,250\n95 when they did away with the old\nWindow manager from Windows 3.1 and\n\n243\n00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,800\nwent to this new Start menu,\ntons of people complained.\n\n244\n00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,890\nSo it does take some getting used to.\n\n245\n00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:23,110\nI've been using it for\nalmost a year now it seems,\n\n246\n00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,295\nand that's about true, almost a year.\n\n247\n00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:29,187\nAnd I kinda like it.\n\n248\n00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,823\nHow have you snapped into it?\n\n249\n00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,590\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, it's good,\nit's good, yeah.\n\n250\n00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,288\nIt does take a little getting used to,\ncuz you get used to,\n\n251\n00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:40,365\nthere's a lot of different ways\nto get to something in Windows,\n\n252\n00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:45,120\nand so you get used to those ways of\ngetting there, but yeah, it works.\n\n253\n00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,330\nIt's fast, too.\n\n254\n00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,810\nIf you get it set up and configured\nwith the things you access the most,\n\n255\n00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,960\nand you put it right there\non your Start screen.\n\n256\n00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,130\nThe computer boots up,\ngoes right to the Start screen,\n\n257\n00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,010\nand there's all the stuff that you would\nclick on to get to the Start menu anyhow.\n\n258\n00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,059\nAnd you put everything there, and\nit's just, [SOUND], real quick.\n\n259\n00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:04,331\n>> Now, one thing I do wanna throw out for\nthe exam is,\n\n260\n00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:09,282\nyou'll notice that Nate called the Start\nscreen the Modern User Interface,\n\n261\n00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:13,260\nand you might be thinking,\nthey're just calling it modern.\n\n262\n00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,420\nRight?\nThey're fancy.\n\n263\n00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,700\nBut that's actually the name of it.\n\n264\n00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,100\nIt's called the Modern UI, or\nthe Modern User Interface.\n\n265\n00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,490\nBe careful.\n\n266\n00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,600\nOut on the Internet, you will find,\nyou know that crazy Internet,\n\n267\n00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,760\nyou'll find tons of people referring to it\nas the Metro UI, the Metro User Interface.\n\n268\n00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,735\nAnd that's because while\nWindows 8 was in beta and\n\n269\n00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:35,330\npre-release status,\nMicrosoft actually called it the Metro UI.\n\n270\n00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,470\nBut it turns out there's a software\ncompany out there that already had\n\n271\n00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,520\na trademark, or a copyright, or\nsomething on that term Metro, and\n\n272\n00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,370\nso Microsoft had to change it\nbefore they went into release.\n\n273\n00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,777\nAnd so they did, and\nit's called the Modern UI.\n\n274\n00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:51,656\nOn the exam, it's called the Modern UI.\n\n275\n00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,320\nRight?\nSo be ready for that.\n\n276\n00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,439\nDon't expect to see that\nterm Metro on the exam.\n\n277\n00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:58,168\n>> Yep.\n\n278\n00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,479\nCloud integration.\n\n279\n00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,385\nRight?\n>> Lots of that.\n\n280\n00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:02,568\n>> So we've got SkyDrive.\n\n281\n00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:05,770\nRight?\nThat is kind of mingled into everything.\n\n282\n00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,110\nQuick stuff on that.\n\n283\n00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,135\nThe biggest thing, I think,\nis the Microsoft account.\n\n284\n00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:11,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n285\n00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,410\n>> So you have the option now to login\nwith your computer using a Microsoft\n\n286\n00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,872\naccount, and it will sync your settings,\nand passwords, apps,\n\n287\n00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:22,559\nand all sorts of things.\n\n288\n00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,481\nThere's a big long list of stuff\nthat you can sync to your account.\n\n289\n00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:32,242\nYou go to another Windows 8 PC, you log\nin using that same Microsoft account.\n\n290\n00:13:32,242 --> 00:13:36,685\nAnd when that PC gets into its Start\nscreen, your theme will be there, and\n\n291\n00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:41,130\nyour profile picture, and passwords,\nand settings, and history, and\n\n292\n00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,579\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n293\n00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,100\n>> Yeah, it's really slick.\n\n294\n00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,710\nAnd if you don't have a Microsoft\naccount already, they're free.\n\n295\n00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,920\nA lot of us have them because we use\nservices like Hotmail, or whatever.\n\n296\n00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,890\nIf you don't, let's say you've never used\na single Microsoft service in the past\n\n297\n00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,620\nbefore, well, you're gonna have to\nget a Microsoft account anyway,\n\n298\n00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,300\nbecause when you get certified, you need\na Microsoft account to log in to check\n\n299\n00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,360\nyour certification benefits, download\nyour certificate, and all of that.\n\n300\n00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,070\nSo, if you don't already have one, you can\ngo to any of the various service sites.\n\n301\n00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,003\nSo you can go to www.skydrive.com,\nor www.outlook.com,\n\n302\n00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,952\nwww.live.com, or\nyou can just go to www.microsoft.com.\n\n303\n00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,517\nIt's got right on there where\nyou can register for an account.\n\n304\n00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:24,638\nAnd then you can start logging\ninto your desktop that way.\n\n305\n00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:25,856\nNumerous cool things there.\n\n306\n00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:29,868\nThe SkyDrive part you mentioned briefly,\nif you're logging in with a Microsoft\n\n307\n00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:33,360\naccount, they give you, it's not much,\nlike five gigs of storage.\n\n308\n00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,960\nRight?\n\n309\n00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,200\n>> Yeah, five or seven?\n\n310\n00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,580\n>> Okay.\n>> Something like that.\n\n311\n00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,600\n>> So, a meager amount of storage.\n\n312\n00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,214\nBut it's reasonable for storing your\ndocuments and things like that.\n\n313\n00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,379\nAnd if you do that, if you store your\ndocuments there, you can login on\n\n314\n00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,770\ndifferent PCs and have access to those\ndocuments, all just in the cloud.\n\n315\n00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,571\nRight?\n\n316\n00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:52,779\nThat's a big buzz word.\n\n317\n00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:53,336\n>> Yeah.\n\n318\n00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:57,977\nAnd even when you first sign in to Windows\n8, if you don't already have a Microsoft\n\n319\n00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:02,354\naccount, you have the option to create\nit right there as you're signing in for\n\n320\n00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:03,810\nthe first time.\n\n321\n00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,928\nOn your PC, there will be a link.\n\n322\n00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:09,590\nIt says, don't already have an account,\nclick here, and you can do it right there.\n\n323\n00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you have internet access\n\n324\n00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,910\nwhile you're setting it up.\n\n325\n00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,801\n>> That's a good point, yep.\n\n326\n00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:16,460\nIf your network card isn't\ndetected by Windows 8 [LAUGH]-\n\n327\n00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,258\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n328\n00:15:18,258 --> 00:15:21,980\nBut yeah, we'll get into drivers and\neverything.\n\n329\n00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,860\nReset and Refresh.\n\n330\n00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,845\nRight?\n\n331\n00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:27,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Reset and Refresh, so\n\n332\n00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,560\nit's a new thing to Windows 8.\n\n333\n00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,400\nRefresh, it's the option\nto reinstall Windows,\n\n334\n00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,840\nwhile keeping your user files,\nuser settings,\n\n335\n00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,775\ndesktop style apps, but your Modern UI\nstyle apps, those will be wiped out.\n\n336\n00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:46,850\nReinstall Windows.\n\n337\n00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:51,914\nThe Reset wipes everything out and\njust reinstalls Windows.\n\n338\n00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:54,815\nIt's real convenient if\nyou've really hosed Windows.\n\n339\n00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:55,872\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,031\n>> And time's ticking away.\n\n341\n00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,156\nYou're not quite getting it.\n\n342\n00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:02,390\nRefresh wipes everything out,\nreinstalls Windows.\n\n343\n00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,250\nIf that doesn't work you can just Reset.\n\n344\n00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,436\nCleans everything out, and yeah,\nyou can get it up and running again.\n\n345\n00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:08,371\n>> It's pretty cool.\n\n346\n00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:11,669\nA lot of venders There's like Dell and\n\n347\n00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:16,360\nHP, they will kind of,\nwhat's the right word here?\n\n348\n00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,330\nPackage or whatever,\na recovery partition on your hard drive.\n\n349\n00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,660\nSo a little section of your hard\ndrive that you can't get at,\n\n350\n00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,660\nanyway it's like wasted space, and if your\ncomputer really gets hosed up you can\n\n351\n00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,130\nrecover from that and it puts\neverything back to factory defaults.\n\n352\n00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,020\nAnd well, now Windows 8 has that\nsame basic functionality built in so\n\n353\n00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,270\nyou don't need a crazy vendor partition\nsitting there eating up space\n\n354\n00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,030\non your hard drive, or\nif you're like me and you deleted it and\n\n355\n00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,370\nits gone, this gives you that\nalternative to quickly recover.\n\n356\n00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,230\nVery, very cool feature.\n\n357\n00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,750\n>> Windows To Go.\n\n358\n00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,270\nWindows To Go is new to Windows,\n\n359\n00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:54,140\nit allows you to install Windows\nto a removable USB drive, or\n\n360\n00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,780\nlike a flash drive, and it runs Windows.\n\n361\n00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,680\nYou can boot a PC off of that removable\ndrive, and yeah, take it with you.\n\n362\n00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,664\nReal convenient for if you're working\nfrom home, and let's say your company\n\n363\n00:17:07,664 --> 00:17:12,571\nhas a lot of line of business apps,\nthings of that nature, they don't want to\n\n364\n00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:16,647\npush out an image for you to take home and\nrun on your personal PC,\n\n365\n00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:21,704\nthey can just give you a little Windows To\nGo bootable USB drive, and you can even\n\n366\n00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:26,962\nput BitLocker drive encryption on to it,\nand take it there, and boot off of that.\n\n367\n00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n368\n00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,660\nIt's really cool, and\nnumerous uses for it.\n\n369\n00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,610\nIf you just want to like experiment with\nWindows 8, but not actually install it on\n\n370\n00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,200\nyour machine, you could do a Window To Go\nUSB key, and boot off of that instead.\n\n371\n00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,960\nIf you're gonna be traveling,\ninstead of taking your laptop with you or\n\n372\n00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,060\nall that, if you know there's\na computer where you're going, you\n\n373\n00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,885\ncould have Windows To Go on that USB key,\nor I've done it to a USB hard drive also.\n\n374\n00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:53,520\nA little clunkier, but\nyou can stick a USB key in your pocket,\n\n375\n00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,970\nyou travel somewhere,\nyou pop it into the computer,\n\n376\n00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,260\nall that's required really is that you\ncan boot off the USB drive, right?\n\n377\n00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,240\nWhich not every computer does but\nmost of them do these days.\n\n378\n00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,110\nAnd you boot off the USB key and\nthere you are, you're up and\n\n379\n00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,340\nrunning with all your favorite\napplications and your system.\n\n380\n00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:14,049\n>> Client Hyper-V, right?\n\n381\n00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:19,040\nSo, Hyper-V is Microsoft's\nlittle virtualization thing.\n\n382\n00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,900\n>> Shouldn't be called little anymore.\n\n383\n00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,760\nIt's gotten quite big.\n\n384\n00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,235\n>> It's their big virtualization thing.\n\n385\n00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:26,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n386\n00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,450\nit was originally just on Windows Server,\nand so now Windows 8,\n\n387\n00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,964\nWindows 8 Pro, and\nWindows 8 Enterprise has Hyper-V,\n\n388\n00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:41,140\nclient Hyper-V built right into it,\nand so you can virtualize machines,\n\n389\n00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,410\nwhich we'll get into a little bit later,\nbut that's what it does.\n\n390\n00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:49,500\n>> And for somebody like you, the viewer\nat home, if you're studying for this exam,\n\n391\n00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,450\nit would be nice to have a couple of\nWindows 8 machines to work with or\n\n392\n00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,040\neven a Windows server machine to work\nwith, but you might only have one\n\n393\n00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,090\ncomputer, right, so you can fire up\nHyper-V and create some virtual machines.\n\n394\n00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,880\nRun multiple instances of\nWindows at the same time.\n\n395\n00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,460\nIt's great for learning networking and\nkind of testing out all the features\n\n396\n00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,640\nthat you might not be able to do\non a physical environment, and\n\n397\n00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,220\nif you think well, I've only got one\nproduct key for Windows or whatever,\n\n398\n00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,890\nI've only got this one license, well when\nyou run Hyper-V, you can bring up and\n\n399\n00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,320\ndelete virtual machines at your leisure.\n\n400\n00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,704\nSo you can go to Microsoft's website and\ndownload the,\n\n401\n00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:28,814\nis it a 180 day demo, or\na 60 day demo, it's a pretty long one.\n\n402\n00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:29,395\n>> 180.\n\n403\n00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:32,930\n>> 180 day, so you can get a,\nwhat is that 6 months?\n\n404\n00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:40,140\n>> Actually, it could be 30 days,\ncuz you've got like three different ones.\n\n405\n00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,390\nYou install something and you get\nthree days, you do something else and\n\n406\n00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,660\nyou get like yeah three months.\n\n407\n00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,280\n>> Oh yeah, that's right.\n\n408\n00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,960\nSo its sorta got a 30 day grace period,\nand then you can reset it twice.\n\n409\n00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,919\nSo you can get up to 90 days.\n\n410\n00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,630\n>> Yep, and then server is 60 days.\n\n411\n00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,700\n>> Okay.\n>> And you can do it twice or three times.\n\n412\n00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,100\n>> I'm just verifying.\n\n413\n00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,472\nOkay.\nSo I just pulled it up on\n\n414\n00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:06,705\nthe Microsoft Developer Network,\nthe MSDN network.\n\n415\n00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,570\nThey've got it right here.\n\n416\n00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,770\nThis evaluation provides a 90 day\ntrial of Windows 8 Enterprise edition.\n\n417\n00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,661\nSo you can go right to Microsoft's\nwebsite, you can download Windows 8 or\n\n418\n00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,264\nServer 2012 with 100 and, or\nI keep going with the hundreds.\n\n419\n00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:22,335\n90 day trial and so\nyou can build up a lab environment, and\n\n420\n00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:24,600\nwhat do you do at the end of 90 days?\n\n421\n00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,900\nWell, the machines are dead in the water,\nyou can pay for them if you want or\n\n422\n00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,800\nyou can delete them.\n\n423\n00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,280\nAnd build some new ones and\nrun the new ones for 90 days.\n\n424\n00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,060\nAnd if you're just learning,\nyou'll probably do that many times, right?\n\n425\n00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,660\nI don't even think I can count the amount\nof virtual machines I've build over\n\n426\n00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,820\nthe years.\n\n427\n00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,360\nHow about you?\n\n428\n00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,140\n>> Yeah, a few, I mean I hang on.\n\n429\n00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,744\nI usually build them with purpose, and so\nI use them and, it's a little machine,\n\n430\n00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,881\nI mean, you've built it from the ground\nup and you've taken care of it and\n\n431\n00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:54,392\nyou don't wanna just delete it, you know,\nlike it's just some old thing and.\n\n432\n00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:56,660\n>> [LAUGH] You got emotional attachment?\n\n433\n00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,060\n>> Well yeah.\nYou gotta keep it.\n\n434\n00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,010\nOh yeah, a good thing with\nthose evaluation things is it's\n\n435\n00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,470\nthe Enterprise editions and\nso you get the.\n\n436\n00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,483\n>> The full feature set.\n\n437\n00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:07,083\n>> Yeah, the full feature set.\n\n438\n00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:07,664\nYep.\n\n439\n00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:09,510\n>> All right, we got anything else?\n\n440\n00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:14,170\n>> Yeah, last thing, right,\nwith what's new to Windows 8, right?\n\n441\n00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,340\nIs the different processors\nthat it can run on, right?\n\n442\n00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,670\n>> Oh, the ARM support.\n\n443\n00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,670\nI was thinking like what like.\n\n444\n00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,233\n>> Yeah I was going to say it\nlike real vague and whatnot, and\n\n445\n00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,395\nbe like come on Don, what, what.\n\n446\n00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:33,230\nBut yeah, Windows 8 RT, right?\n\n447\n00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,850\n>> Wait, I get confused.\n\n448\n00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,330\nIs it Windows 8 RT or\nis it just Windows RT?\n\n449\n00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,360\nI don't think they use the eight\nwhen they talk about it anymore.\n\n450\n00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:49,440\nIt's definitely on the exam, but I think\nthey ditched that, I gotta find out now.\n\n451\n00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,210\nNow my curiosity is spiked.\n\n452\n00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,010\n>> This Windows RT thing.\n\n453\n00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,930\nSo yeah, you have your Intel,\nyour AMD processors.\n\n454\n00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,150\nWell you've got ARM processors, right?\n\n455\n00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,210\nARM processors generally found in mobile\nphones, tablets, things of that sort.\n\n456\n00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:13,129\nARM and x86 stuff, they don't really,\ncompatible with one another,\n\n457\n00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:17,602\nso Windows RT is built to\nrun on ARM processors.\n\n458\n00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,867\n>> Yeah, we are seeing a,\nlet's come up with a cool word,\n\n459\n00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:23,791\na plethora of mobile devices these days,\nright?\n\n460\n00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,250\nI try, a virtual cornucopia of mobility.\n\n461\n00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:27,880\n>> Even better.\n\n462\n00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,028\n>> So we've got a number of tablets and\n\n463\n00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:37,013\ncellphones and ultra portable netbooks.\n\n464\n00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:41,407\nThings like that, these really small,\nreally mobile devises that need long\n\n465\n00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:44,991\nbattery life, and\nyour standard Intel based architectures,\n\n466\n00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:48,575\nyour X86s like Nate was saying\nwhich are usually are Intel and\n\n467\n00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:53,550\nAMD, those processors, they're great,\nright, and really good for performance.\n\n468\n00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,720\nNot so good for power consumption.\n\n469\n00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,310\nAnd so that's where ARM comes in.\n\n470\n00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,370\nARM is a, it's a company,\nnot an organization, and\n\n471\n00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,400\nthey basically created a processor\nspecification that's very power efficient.\n\n472\n00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,250\nNot as powerful, right?\n\n473\n00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,390\nThe processors aren't on the same\nlevel power, punch for punch,\n\n474\n00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,490\nas a regular x86 processor is, but power\nconsumption is extremely low on them.\n\n475\n00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,190\nSo you're really seeing\nthem adopted a lot.\n\n476\n00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,490\nSo Microsoft said hey, why not get\nWindows to run on these new processors?\n\n477\n00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,406\nAnd so they released Windows RT, and\n\n478\n00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:31,399\nwhile it hasn't been a blazing\nsuccess in the market, right?\n\n479\n00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,980\nIt really hasn't been selling well at all.\n\n480\n00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,870\nYou do need to be aware of it for\nthe exam, right?\n\n481\n00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,570\nSo it is definitely something\nthat is new and that's out there.\n\n482\n00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,990\nThe main reason we need\nto be aware of it is,\n\n483\n00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,440\nyour standard x86 applications\nwill not run on Windows RT.\n\n484\n00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,340\nSo, applications have to be\nrecompiled to run on ARM processors.\n\n485\n00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,699\nSo, if you have line of business\napplications, like a point of sales cash\n\n486\n00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,234\nregister program or whatever, odds\nare it won't run on Windows RT, right?\n\n487\n00:23:57,234 --> 00:24:00,637\nBut if that developer says, hey,\nwe want it to run this way, and\n\n488\n00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:04,630\nthey recompile their software for\nWindows RT, then it will run just fine.\n\n489\n00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,331\nAnd it's really not that big of\na burden for them to do that.\n\n490\n00:24:07,331 --> 00:24:10,766\nWell, unless they're using like\nthird party libraries and stuff, so.\n\n491\n00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:11,334\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n492\n00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:12,026\nYep.\n\n493\n00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:16,923\nAnd when WINDOWS RT, it's only available\npre-installed on computers, so\n\n494\n00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:20,100\nyou can't download it or get it anywhere.\n\n495\n00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,390\nAnd Windows RT, it's not really\ncovered in-depth on the exam,\n\n496\n00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,850\nbut, it is referenced in there.\n\n497\n00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,410\nAnd so you do need to be made aware of it.\n\n498\n00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,415\nYou know, for stuff and what not.\n\n499\n00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:34,340\n>> [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n500\n00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,780\nAnd if you ever have a chance\nto use a Windows RT machine,\n\n501\n00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,340\nonce you've gotten over the fact\nthat it's a different processor,\n\n502\n00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,570\neverything else really is identical.\n\n503\n00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,780\nIt looks exactly the same.\n\n504\n00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,890\nYou have the same start menu,\nthe same desktop.\n\n505\n00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,310\nThe only difference is,\nyou can only run RT apps.\n\n506\n00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,150\nSo you have a much smaller\napplication library now and\n\n507\n00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,820\nit's growing over time as those devices\nget adopted and become more popular.\n\n508\n00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,830\nSo the first time that the Microsoft\nhas launched on a non x86.\n\n509\n00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,630\nProcessor core.\n\n510\n00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:07,340\nSo Windows Server, still to this\nday comes out in Itanium Edition.\n\n511\n00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,110\nWhich is Intel, Intel has a high end\n64 bit architecture called Itanium.\n\n512\n00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,560\nYou don't see it in desktops.\n\n513\n00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,460\nYou really just see it in\ncertain server applications.\n\n514\n00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,100\nAnd so\nthere's a version of Windows for that.\n\n515\n00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,140\nAnd, same thing.\n\n516\n00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,960\nYou gotta have Itanium\napps to be able to run.\n\n517\n00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,410\nAlthough, it is backwards\ncompatible with some older stuff.\n\n518\n00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,410\nBut in the NT4 day,\nIntel supported digital, DEC.\n\n519\n00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,630\nSo they supported DEC\nprocessors back in NT4, so\n\n520\n00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,350\nit's not the first time that\nMicrosoft has done that.\n\n521\n00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,700\nNow, the other ones haven't\nbeen very successful either, so\n\n522\n00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,050\nwe'll see what happens this time.\n\n523\n00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,150\n>> So yeah, those are the biggest\nfeatures new to Windows 8.\n\n524\n00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:50,710\nWe'll dive a little bit more in-depth\nas we go through the objectives,\n\n525\n00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,890\nand move through and do all that stuff.\n\n526\n00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,070\n>> Yeah, lots of new stuff.\n\n527\n00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,690\nAnd we keep talking about Windows 8.\n\n528\n00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,720\nWell, Windows 8.1 is is out yet?\n\n529\n00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,990\n>> Is it\n>> It's in preview release right now.\n\n530\n00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,030\n>> Ok, so it's not officially out yet.\n\n531\n00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:11,700\nSo windows 8.1 has already been announced\nand kind of released in the preview stage.\n\n532\n00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,130\nSo it's I think they will\nrelease it in October.\n\n533\n00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,870\n>> Probably,\n>> Okay Microsoft loves October, October,\n\n534\n00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,640\nSeptember for\n\n535\n00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,480\nhardware, October for software\nthat's kind of Microsoft's pattern.\n\n536\n00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,730\nThey always follow, but\nanyhow so it's coming out, and\n\n537\n00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,360\nit's just improvements upon Windows eight,\nthe exam is still based on\n\n538\n00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,390\nregular Windows eight and it will be for\na while, when they update the exam to 8.1,\n\n539\n00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,840\nwe'll do some new episodes and make sure\nthat you guys are up to date on that and\n\n540\n00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,275\nthat you're ready for\nthe questions you'll face on the exam.\n\n541\n00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:48,370\n>> Alright well now that we've got\nthat out of the way we can move on and\n\n542\n00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:53,730\nstart looking at installing windows eight\nbut you know getting a little little\n\n543\n00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,540\nclose on the time something that\nyou know maybe we'll pick up.\n\n544\n00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,550\nAfter the break.\n>> I think that's a good idea so\n\n545\n00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,820\nlets stop here we'll take a break\ngive everybody a breather when we get\n\n546\n00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,950\nback we're gonna talk about what needs\nto be done to get Windows eight up and\n\n547\n00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:09,960\nrunning on our machine or\nvirtual machine as the case may be and\n\n548\n00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,825\ncontinue on from there so\n>> Got anything else to throw in.\n\n549\n00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:15,211\n>> I'm good for now.\n\n550\n00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,118\n>> Ladies and gentlemen,\nwe'll be back in a few minutes.\n\n551\n00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:24,898\n[MUSIC]\n\n552\n00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:26,604\n[NOISE] All right.\n\n553\n00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,161\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n554\n00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:30,870\nSo before the break we were talking\nabout what's new in Windows 8.\n\n555\n00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,960\nNow we're actually gonna talk\nabout getting it installed.\n\n556\n00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,570\nAnd I know a lot of people are just,\njust jam the DVD in there and\n\n557\n00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,550\nget the install going.\n\n558\n00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,450\nBut there is a little bit\nof stuff we need to do.\n\n559\n00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,420\nPrior to actually installing\nthe software and endgoing so\n\n560\n00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:50,800\nwe need to be sure that our hardware\nis capable of running Windows 8,\n\n561\n00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,365\nthat we're ready to be able to support\nthat software and get it up and going.\n\n562\n00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:54,280\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n563\n00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,970\nYep.\nThere are the Windows 8 upgrade\n\n564\n00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,460\nadvisor tool that you can download and\nrun and\n\n565\n00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,520\nit'll evaluate your system and\ndo that kind of thing.\n\n566\n00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,510\nYeah, I mean, that would be a good way\nto go, but we'll, yeah, we'll talk about\n\n567\n00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,625\njust some of the quick and easy things\nto determine which Edition of Windows.\n\n568\n00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n569\n00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,050\n>> Windows 8 is right for you.\n\n570\n00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:23,680\n>> So, the place I like to start is\nthe good old fashioned Microsoft website.\n\n571\n00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,650\nRight?\nYou go to the Microsoft website and\n\n572\n00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,940\nthey've got the Windows 8 system\nrequirements posted right there.\n\n573\n00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,420\nSo, let me pull these up and they're kind\nof small so let me blow that up a bit.\n\n574\n00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,150\nAll right, so\n\n575\n00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,160\nhere's the Windows 8 system requirements\nstraight from the horse's mouth, right?\n\n576\n00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,140\nRight from Microsoft,\nand these requirements,\n\n577\n00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,860\nyou're going to see in,\nI know, they're pretty funny.\n\n578\n00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,760\nIn real life land,\nyou have what are called\n\n579\n00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,780\nrequirements, and\nthen you have like recommendations, right?\n\n580\n00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,960\nSo, what we're looking at\nhere is what is absolutely,\n\n581\n00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,470\nbare minimum required to run Windows 8.\n\n582\n00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,380\nBut, if you were to run Windows 8\non a machine spec'd out like this,\n\n583\n00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,710\nyou're not going to be happy.\n\n584\n00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,470\nAnd so, you know, you really do want\nto have a little bit more, so let's.\n\n585\n00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,860\nLet's talk about what's required and\nwhat would actually make us happy.\n\n586\n00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,190\nSo the first thing is a processor, and\nit's telling us that we need a 1GHz or\n\n587\n00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,210\nfaster processor with support for PAE, NX,\n\n588\n00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,450\nand SSE2, which is quite a mouthful.\n\n589\n00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,250\nThe reality is that\nWindows 8 will run on any,\n\n590\n00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,508\nreally darn near any modern Intel or\nAMD 64 processor, right?\n\n591\n00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:34,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n592\n00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,565\n>> So, let's start there, right.\n\n593\n00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:40,310\nCause I'm kind of jumping into something\nthat they don't call out right here in\n\n594\n00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,110\nthe requirements.\n\n595\n00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,940\nThey don't.\n\n596\n00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,470\nMentioned, I guess they mentioned it\na little bit down there, but when we talk\n\n597\n00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:51,720\nabout hunting for that right processor for\nWindows 8, Windows 8 comes in two flavors.\n\n598\n00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,471\nIt comes in a 32-bit and\na 64-bit flavor, right?\n\n599\n00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:56,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now.\n\n600\n00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,730\nFor those of you that watched\nour comp TA plus show,\n\n601\n00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,880\nyou already know the difference, but\nif you didn't want that show well,\n\n602\n00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,220\nit's actually a pretty decent difference\nin the physical processors that we use.\n\n603\n00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,280\nSo, if we're gonna run Windows 8, one of\nthe first decisions we have to make is\n\n604\n00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,290\nwhether we wanna go 64-bit or\n32-bit, right?\n\n605\n00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,200\nAnd I don't wanna bore you guys to\ndeath with technical details, but\n\n606\n00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,880\nthe big difference,\nthe primary difference for\n\n607\n00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,350\nus Is going to be the amount of\nmemory that we can address, right?\n\n608\n00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,800\nAnd notice how there's two\ndifferent memory requirements here.\n\n609\n00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,270\n1 gigabyte minimum recommended for\n32-bit systems,\n\n610\n00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,080\n2 gig for 64-bit systems, and\nthen they don't list it here, but\n\n611\n00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,390\nthere's actually a maximum\namount of memory.\n\n612\n00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:44,170\nOn a 32-bit system, the maximum amount\nof memory that you can address, 3 gigs.\n\n613\n00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,120\nOr, did they bump it to 4?\n\n614\n00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,720\n>> Well, they call it 4 gigs but\nit's just under.\n\n615\n00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,890\n>> Actually 3 or something.\n\n616\n00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,400\n>> Yeah, just under 4 or\nsomething like that.\n\n617\n00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,860\n>> Okay.\nIn Windows 7 and\n\n618\n00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,470\nearlier, A 32-bit system can\naddress 4 gigs of memory.\n\n619\n00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,300\nBut they had a false ceiling,\n\n620\n00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:06,510\na software limitation they put in at 3\ngigs, so on a Windows 7 32-bit machine,\n\n621\n00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:10,430\neven though it could address 4 gigs,\nit would only address 3.\n\n622\n00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,530\nAnd I thought they had removed that in\nWindows 8, but either way, 4 gigs is your\n\n623\n00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:20,400\nupper absolute maximum ceiling on a 32-bit\nsystem So 64 bit gets us much higher.\n\n624\n00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,970\nAnd I don't remember the maximum on that.\n\n625\n00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,690\nIt's like 2 terabytes or\nsomething isn't it?\n\n626\n00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,790\n>> Yeah, it's yeah.\n>> Or petabytes or.\n\n627\n00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,500\n>> It's a lot.\n>> I don't know, something like that.\n\n628\n00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,335\nPezetabytes.\n\n629\n00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:29,360\n>> [LAUGH] Oh dang!\n\n630\n00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,090\n>> That's right, my own, yeah.\n\n631\n00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,260\nThat was good.\n\n632\n00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:42,890\n>> If we want to go 64 bit we've got\nto have a 64 bit capable processor.\n\n633\n00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,934\nNow, how do you know if your\nprocessor is 64 bit capable or not?\n\n634\n00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:49,660\n>> System properties.\n\n635\n00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,770\n>> If you're already\nrunning windows right?\n\n636\n00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,640\n>> You bios would tell you,\nor the sticker on the box.\n\n637\n00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,891\n>> Usually a number of different places,\nright?\n\n638\n00:31:57,891 --> 00:32:01,440\nIf you actually bought the processor it\nshould be on the box or in the manual,\n\n639\n00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,499\nor hopefully you knew\nbefore you bought it.\n\n640\n00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:06,807\nIf you own a machine that you picked\nup at a garage sale, you have no idea,\n\n641\n00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:10,509\nIf it's already running Windows, sure\nyou can go into your system properties.\n\n642\n00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:13,020\nThere's also software, CPU-Z.\n\n643\n00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n644\n00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,805\nWhich is a free software that you can run\nthat'll tell you if you're 64-bit or not.\n\n645\n00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or if you know the model number of your\n\n646\n00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,830\nprocessor, you can go out and\ngo to Intel or AMD's site,\n\n647\n00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,120\nit'll tell you if it's 64-bit or not.\n\n648\n00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,330\n>> Yep, and if you have the option,\n64-bit's the way to go.\n\n649\n00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:28,890\n>> Absolutely.\n\n650\n00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,990\n>> There's the benefits of 64-bit,\nyou can address more memory,\n\n651\n00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,775\nyou get better performance because you\ncan address more data clump cycles.\n\n652\n00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:37,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n653\n00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,530\nYeah, It's a lot safer too because\nyou have mandatory drivers signing.\n\n654\n00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:46,033\nYou get your data\nexecution prevention thing.\n\n655\n00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:47,405\n>> Yes, the DEP.\n\n656\n00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:51,923\n>> DEP.\nYup, and, 64 bit, you're on Hyper V, so\n\n657\n00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:55,840\nyou have to have that Hyper V feature.\n\n658\n00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,490\n>> And I'll tell you,\n\n659\n00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:00,350\nalmost every computer these days is\nshipping with a 64-bit capable processor.\n\n660\n00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,900\nNow I say, capable and that's because\nthe standard that we follow is called\n\n661\n00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,390\nthe AMD64 standard or\nprocessor architecture.\n\n662\n00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,430\nAnd with AMD64 processors,\n\n663\n00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:15,570\nand I know it's AMD but even Intel follows\nthe AMD standard, which is kind of funny,\n\n664\n00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,305\ncuz AMD followed Intel for so long,\nnow it's kind of the other way around.\n\n665\n00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:21,160\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> But the cool part about it is,\n\n666\n00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:27,080\nan AMD64 processor running a 64-bit OS\ncan still run 32 bit apps if it wants,\n\n667\n00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,910\nso it's backwards compatible.\n\n668\n00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,020\nWhere as a 32-bit OS can't\nrun the 64-bit apps, right?\n\n669\n00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,720\nSo if you go 64-bit, you get all\nthe benefits Nate mentioned, right.\n\n670\n00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,770\nThe DEP and all the added security and\nhigher memory addressing, right.\n\n671\n00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,610\nAll that good Stuff, and you get\nbackwards compatibility with 32-bits.\n\n672\n00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,270\nSo, for most people 64-bit\nis what we want these days.\n\n673\n00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,630\n>> Yep, except drivers though,\nyou still need 64-bit specific drivers so,\n\n674\n00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,030\neverything else backwards, except those.\n\n675\n00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,920\n>> Which, most vendors at this point\nhave caught up to, when Windows Vista\n\n676\n00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,320\nfirst came out and it was all pushing\n64-bit it was really hard to find.\n\n677\n00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,710\n64-bit drivers.\n\n678\n00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,590\nWindows 7, Windows 8,\nthey've come out now so\n\n679\n00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,090\nthere's really a lot of compatibility now.\n\n680\n00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:18,520\nSo I do have a hard time coming up with\na reason why not to go 64-bit, right.\n\n681\n00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:24,410\nThe only time you'd really chose to go\n34-bit is, if you had really old hardware.\n\n682\n00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,750\nIf you had old hardware that\nwas just not 64-bit capable.\n\n683\n00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,010\nSo if you've got an old Pentium,\nor an older AMD,\n\n684\n00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,780\nlike some of the earlier Athalons and\nstuff, that might not be 64-bit capable.\n\n685\n00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,715\nyou may have to run 32-bit OS.\n\n686\n00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:45,530\n>> Yeah, like a little netbooks, right,\nthose guys generally have a 32-bit and\n\n687\n00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,530\nyou can only cram 2 gigs of\nmemory in those things, or\n\n688\n00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:54,751\neven 1 gig sometimes so you are forced to.\n\n689\n00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:58,320\n>> I think, do I, I run.\n\n690\n00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,500\nI run a 32-bit version of Windows 7 on\nmy media center at home, because my,\n\n691\n00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,350\noh, I actually got rid of it.\n\n692\n00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,240\nMy old TV tuner card was\ngiving me some problems,\n\n693\n00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,530\nthe 64-bit driver was horrible for it, and\nso I went back to the 32-bit version of\n\n694\n00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,790\nWindows, but I've replace that tuner\nsince then, now that I think about it,\n\n695\n00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,460\nI need to go home and\nupgrade that machine [LAUGH].\n\n696\n00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,250\nSo anyhow there are occasionally times\nwhere you might need to go 32-bit.\n\n697\n00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,190\nMost people are going to shoot for\n64- bit.\n\n698\n00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:28,490\nNow some of the other requirements they\nmention in here, PAE, NX, SSE2, right?\n\n699\n00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,690\nWhat are some of those?\n\n700\n00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,460\nSo PAE,\ndo you remember what PAE stands for?\n\n701\n00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,020\nI can't remember what it stands for.\n\n702\n00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,198\nBasically it means being able to address\nthe larger memory spaces, right?\n\n703\n00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:43,380\nAnd in 32-bit systems you can actually\n\n704\n00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,970\nleverage PAE to address even more than\n4 gigs, although Microsoft blocked it.\n\n705\n00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,680\nIt was like an artificial limit.\n\n706\n00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,180\nBut we do need support for that in Windows\n8, pretty much any processor made in\n\n707\n00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,470\npretty much, really almost the last\n10 years is gonna have that.\n\n708\n00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,594\nIf you're trying to run Windows 8\non a computer older than 10 years,\n\n709\n00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:02,010\nwell that's your own problem.\n\n710\n00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:08,430\n[LAUGH] NX is the no-execute bit,\nwhich is you mentioned DEP earlier.\n\n711\n00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,390\nIt's a part of that,\ndata execution prevention.\n\n712\n00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,940\nOriginally it was designed for\nantivirus software, right?\n\n713\n00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,940\nBut it became really useful for things\nlike virtualization cuz you can stop\n\n714\n00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,840\none program from monopolizing\nyour processor or\n\n715\n00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,710\nwhatever by being able\nto prevent executed.\n\n716\n00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:34,980\nAnd then SSE2 that is the original\nversion of what was called MMX, right.\n\n717\n00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,485\nMultimedia acceleration.\n\n718\n00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,773\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And when I say the original version,\n\n719\n00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:41,000\nI'm talking this is Pentium One, right.\n\n720\n00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,510\nYou can get the Pentium One,\n100 MHz with MMX.\n\n721\n00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,040\nNow with MMX, it's a big deal.\n\n722\n00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,585\nIt will make your videos play faster.\n\n723\n00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:48,710\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Well,\n\n724\n00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,920\nthe found that it could do a lot more\nthan just multimedia acceleration,\n\n725\n00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,280\nthat it could accelerate all sorts of\nstuff, so they gave it a more generic name\n\n726\n00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,860\nSSE, which is the,\nI forget what that stands for, but\n\n727\n00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,770\nit has had multiple versions, SSE1,\nSSE2, SSE2 and there's SSE3 also.\n\n728\n00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,430\nSo, they require that?\n\n729\n00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,860\nBut SSE2 came out.\n\n730\n00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,640\nWhen did it come out?\n\n731\n00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,910\nIt came out forever ago.\n\n732\n00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,449\nIt came out in 2003.\n\n733\n00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:18,344\nSo, ten years ago.\n\n734\n00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:21,090\nSo it's been out for a long, long time.\n\n735\n00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,220\nActually, you know what,\nit says 2001 here.\n\n736\n00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,362\nSo, even longer, right.\n\n737\n00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:26,580\nSo it came out a long time ago.\n\n738\n00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,770\nAny system built in the last\n10 years is gonna have that.\n\n739\n00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:34,410\nSo it's not something that we're really\nhaving to struggle to find support for.\n\n740\n00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,197\nSo all right,\nspeaking of hardware requirements.\n\n741\n00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:40,061\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right.\n\n742\n00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:44,330\nThere are screen,\nyour screen resolution requirements.\n\n743\n00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:50,385\nAnd so the minimum screen resolution for,\nwell not really the minimum.\n\n744\n00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:53,537\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> But the minimum to run modern UI style\n\n745\n00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,819\napps, 1024 by 768.\n\n746\n00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:57,768\n>> Yep.\n>> So you have to have that to run\n\n747\n00:37:57,768 --> 00:37:59,120\nmodern style apps.\n\n748\n00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,170\nSo if you've got, most,\nI've got a little netbook.\n\n749\n00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,957\nAnd it's 1024768.\n\n750\n00:38:03,957 --> 00:38:08,860\nSo yeah, I'm not sure where you'd\nrun into like 800 by 600 these days.\n\n751\n00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,190\n>> For the longest time Microsoft.\n\n752\n00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,750\nLike if you booted up into VGA mode or\nsafe mode.\n\n753\n00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,960\nIt would default to 640 by\n480 cuz that was the old\n\n754\n00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,875\nfour by three standard definition screen\nsize that you knew everybody supported.\n\n755\n00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:23,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n756\n00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,450\n>> But over time Microsoft has said,\ncome on,\n\n757\n00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,150\npeople have bought new monitors and\nso they bumped it up to 800 by 600,\n\n758\n00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,690\nand then now they've just gone that\nnext step to 1024 by 768, most people.\n\n759\n00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,740\nHave resolutions much higher than that, so\n\n760\n00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,830\nit's not even something\nwe would worry about.\n\n761\n00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,490\nBut it can be a problem for some people.\n\n762\n00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,590\n>> Yup.\nThere's,\n\n763\n00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,160\nthey call it a maximum resolution too.\n\n764\n00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,685\n>> There's a max?\n\n765\n00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:46,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n766\n00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,038\n>> I did not know that.\n\n767\n00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:48,292\nWhat's the max?\n\n768\n00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,060\n>> 2560 by 1440.\n\n769\n00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,560\n>> Hm.\n\n770\n00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,250\nI wonder why.\n\n771\n00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:59,020\n>> Now, yeah, it's cold out.\n\n772\n00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,460\nAnd I've looked into it a whole lot 'cuz\nthings like infinity, where it'll combine\n\n773\n00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,610\nall your resolutions together, make\nthis one massive, goes higher than that.\n\n774\n00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,520\nSo I've, yeah.\n\n775\n00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,750\n>> That might be, so, what you have in\nWindows is you have certain drivers that\n\n776\n00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,750\nare built into Windows and then you have\nthird party drivers that you add, right,\n\n777\n00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:26,190\nand the built in ones are part of\nthe WDDM or Windows device driver model.\n\n778\n00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,050\nPretty sure it's what that stands for.\n\n779\n00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,780\nWDDM.\n\n780\n00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,490\nA lot of those are the built-in drivers\nthat either Microsoft wrote themselves or\n\n781\n00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,440\nMicrosoft specifically approved from\na vendor and included inside of Windows.\n\n782\n00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,600\nAnd I'll bet that's the maximum\nresolution for the built-in drivers and\n\n783\n00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,460\nthen, if you get a third party one,\nyou can probably go higher.\n\n784\n00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:50,010\nSo, that really, you see some pretty\ncommon resolutions out there.\n\n785\n00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,630\nOn the high end,\n\n786\n00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,550\n1920 by 1080 is getting to be pretty\npopular right now cuz it's HD right?\n\n787\n00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,920\nOr what we consider HD,\n1080i or 1080p or whatever.\n\n788\n00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,366\nBut have you seen those 16 by 10 monitors?\n\n789\n00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:04,391\n>> Yes.\n>> What do those run at?\n\n790\n00:40:04,391 --> 00:40:06,565\n>> Those are 1980 by 1200.\n\n791\n00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:08,008\n>> Okay, so a little bit bigger.\n\n792\n00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:10,568\nI don't have one, never had one.\n\n793\n00:40:10,568 --> 00:40:14,042\nI never understood, like, come on,\n16, all the stuff is 16 x 9, and\n\n794\n00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,498\nthen release these 16 x 10 monitors.\n\n795\n00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:20,530\nBut anyhow, so I'll bet that's the upper\nlimit of what's built into Windows.\n\n796\n00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,410\nI didn't know it had that limit.\n\n797\n00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,240\nThat's cool.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n798\n00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,292\nYep.\nAnd then the Windows Snap feature.\n\n799\n00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:29,433\nRight?\nThat requires a minimum screen resolution,\n\n800\n00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:31,130\n1366 x 768?\n\n801\n00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:31,666\n>> 768.\n\n802\n00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:32,211\n>> Yep.\n\n803\n00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:33,649\n>> Which is what I run my laptop at.\n\n804\n00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:34,603\nI don't think you do.\n\n805\n00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:35,149\n>> No.\n\n806\n00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:38,050\n>> Windows Snap,\nif you're not familiar with that,\n\n807\n00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,092\nif you have a window on your,\nlet me just illustrate.\n\n808\n00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:41,662\nRight?\n\n809\n00:40:41,662 --> 00:40:45,887\nSo, I've got my Windows 8 system\nrequirements pulled up here.\n\n810\n00:40:45,887 --> 00:40:50,900\nAnd if I wanna look at two things at once,\nI might wanna have my Windows\n\n811\n00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,662\nrequirements and my little outline\nover here up at the same time.\n\n812\n00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,254\nRight?\n\n813\n00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:59,204\nSo I can just take a window and\nI can drag it, and\n\n814\n00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:04,460\nif I drag it to the top of the screen\nit'll blow up and fill the whole system.\n\n815\n00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,162\nIf I drag it to the side it'll\njust take that one side.\n\n816\n00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:09,750\nRight?\nSo it lets you quickly and\n\n817\n00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,860\neasily rearrange so you can have\nmultiple things in your monitor.\n\n818\n00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,773\nAnd if you've got a high resolution\nscreen, see, I do this at home,\n\n819\n00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:17,988\nlike when the wife's away.\n\n820\n00:41:17,988 --> 00:41:22,608\nI'll hook my laptop up to\nthe TV in the living room.\n\n821\n00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:23,771\nRight?\n>> Ooh.\n\n822\n00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:27,729\n>> 1920 x 1080, nice and big screen.\n\n823\n00:41:27,729 --> 00:41:28,285\nRight?\n\n824\n00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,491\nIt's big to me.\n\n825\n00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:33,383\nMost people, I think mine's 46 inches,\nwhich some people would laugh at.\n\n826\n00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:35,843\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's so small!\n\n827\n00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,768\nI can't believe you tell\npeople it's that big.\n\n828\n00:41:38,768 --> 00:41:42,747\nBut you can take two web browsers,\nor Microsoft Word, or whatever,\n\n829\n00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:46,535\nand you can put them on the two\nhalves of the screen and it's huge.\n\n830\n00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:48,857\nIt's like having multiple monitors,\nbut all in just one screen.\n\n831\n00:41:48,857 --> 00:41:49,704\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n832\n00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:50,621\nYep.\n\n833\n00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:56,659\nNow the Windows Snap, now there's another\nkind of thing with that Windows Snap.\n\n834\n00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:59,588\nRight?\nWith the Windows 8 style, or\n\n835\n00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:01,755\nthe Modern UI style apps.\n\n836\n00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,406\nCuz normally, the UI style,\n\n837\n00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:07,513\nmodernized style apps, they're full\nscreen, take up the whole thing.\n\n838\n00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:08,861\nYou can only run one at a time.\n\n839\n00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:14,450\nSo with this you can run\ntwo at the same time.\n\n840\n00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,700\n>> If you have two monitors?\n\n841\n00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,671\nOh, just doing the snap?\n\n842\n00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:19,171\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay, got it.\n\n843\n00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,738\n>> So, run both into the same thing and\n\n844\n00:42:21,738 --> 00:42:25,461\nthen, yeah, so that's that.\n>> Cool.\n\n845\n00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,841\nSo, a couple of things to think about\n\n846\n00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:29,646\nthere on your screen, it is a slightly\nhigher resolution than what we had in\n\n847\n00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,093\nolder versions of Windows.\nRight?\n\n848\n00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:34,067\nBut 1024 x 768 is still very low.\n\n849\n00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:36,400\nSo as long as you've got that,\n\n850\n00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,195\nit's gonna run just fine for you.\n\n851\n00:42:38,195 --> 00:42:39,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n852\n00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,080\n>> Hard drive space.\n\n853\n00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,840\nIf you're installing\nthe 32-bit version of Windows,\n\n854\n00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,050\nyou're gonna need a minimum of\n16 gigabytes of storage space.\n\n855\n00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,920\nIf you're going 64-bit,\nyou need 20 gigs, a little bit more.\n\n856\n00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:59,345\nThere was a time where 16 to 20 gigs was\njust an outrageous amount of storage.\n\n857\n00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:02,240\nIn today's world,\nthat's really not much at all, is it?\n\n858\n00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,355\n>> Mm-mm.\n\n859\n00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:04,545\nNope, not at all.\n\n860\n00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:07,075\nIt's a minimum to get Windows installed.\n\n861\n00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:11,480\nIt'll leave a little bit of space to,\nI guess, you had a page file in there.\n\n862\n00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,355\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And some other stuff,\n\n863\n00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:14,560\nbut it really is a minimum.\n\n864\n00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,525\nIt doesn't leave a lot of\nroom to do much else with it.\n\n865\n00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:18,770\n>> Yeah.\nMost computers these days\n\n866\n00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,810\ncome with hard drives that are at\nleast 250 gigs, if not more, so\n\n867\n00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:24,230\nthis is less than 10% of your drive.\n\n868\n00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:29,370\nBut, I mean really, one terabyte,\ntwo terabyte drives are very common today.\n\n869\n00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:34,700\nIf you're watching this video well\nafter we recorded it, then who knows?\n\n870\n00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,280\nMaybe those five terabyte drives\nare dirt cheap today for you.\n\n871\n00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,620\nBut for us, a one terabyte drive\nright now is about 100 bucks.\n\n872\n00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,125\nSo, that's the kind of storage\nlevel a lot of people have.\n\n873\n00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,270\n20 gigs is really a drop in the bucket.\n\n874\n00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,003\n>> Yeah, and if you're spawning\noff a lot of virtual machines, so\n\n875\n00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:55,722\nit would be a minimum that you need for\neach of those little instances pushed off.\n\n876\n00:43:55,722 --> 00:44:00,308\nSo, good number to know so you don't\ncreate a bigger than you need, or?\n\n877\n00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,928\n>> More bigger?\n\n878\n00:44:02,928 --> 00:44:03,730\nAbsolutely.\n\n879\n00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:08,360\nSo, the last requirement that Microsoft\nspecifically calls out is your graphics\n\n880\n00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,100\ncard, your video adapter.\n\n881\n00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,090\nAnd it's somewhat misleading, because\nthey say you need a Microsoft DirectX 9\n\n882\n00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,610\ngraphics device with WDDM driver.\n\n883\n00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:18,291\nAll right.\nSo\n\n884\n00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:23,214\nWDDM means a driver specifically\napproved for Microsoft.\n\n885\n00:44:23,214 --> 00:44:25,530\nRight?\nAnd actually offered by Microsoft,\n\n886\n00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,200\na part of the OS.\n\n887\n00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,680\nYou don't have to have that.\n\n888\n00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,180\nYou can use a third party driver,\n\n889\n00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,690\nbut this is what Microsoft recommends\nyou do when you do the install.\n\n890\n00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:39,500\nAnd DirectX 9, that's Microsoft's\n3D graphics library, and in Windows\n\n891\n00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,700\n8 it uses, in Windows 7 you had that Aero\ninterface and the classic interface.\n\n892\n00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,260\nIn Windows 8, all that Aero stuff,\nthe three dimensional screen effects, and\n\n893\n00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,260\ntransparencies, and all,\nall that is turned on by default.\n\n894\n00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,150\nAnd so they want you to have that\nDirectX capable graphics card,\n\n895\n00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,480\nwhich the majority of them are these days.\n\n896\n00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,251\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm, yep, yep.\n\n897\n00:44:58,251 --> 00:44:59,790\nAll right, yeah.\n\n898\n00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,873\nSo we got the hardware stuff.\n\n899\n00:45:00,873 --> 00:45:02,975\nSo now let's move into the software stuff.\n\n900\n00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:09,790\nSo, upgrading,\nis that on your little page there?\n\n901\n00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,490\n>> I wanna make sure we\ndon't miss something.\n\n902\n00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,870\nAre we gonna mention UEFI later?\n\n903\n00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,950\n>> We can.\n\n904\n00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,960\n>> Well,\nI don't wanna get us out of order.\n\n905\n00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,800\n>> No, no, it's on here somewhere.\n\n906\n00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,747\n>> Okay,\nwell let me just mention it briefly, and\n\n907\n00:45:22,747 --> 00:45:24,363\nwe'll get more in depth into it later.\n\n908\n00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:29,238\nThe BIOS system for most computers\nhas been pretty consistent for\n\n909\n00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:30,751\na long, long time.\n\n910\n00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,759\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n911\n00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:36,002\n>> The Basic Input/Output System for\nyour machine, what you see when you first\n\n912\n00:45:36,002 --> 00:45:40,450\npower on the computer, really has\nremained unchanged for 30 years.\n\n913\n00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:44,960\nAnd in the last couple of years, a new\nstandard has been released called UEFI,\n\n914\n00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,280\nor EFI boot.\n\n915\n00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,840\nThere are a few different names for it.\n\n916\n00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,310\nBut it was released because it helps\n\n917\n00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,090\nto provide some additional security\nfeatures for the boot process.\n\n918\n00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:59,170\nIn Windows RT, which is not\nreally what the exam is based on,\n\n919\n00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,150\nthe UEFI boot loader is\nabsolutely required.\n\n920\n00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,180\nYou have to have it.\n\n921\n00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,048\nAnd it has to be in secure mode which\nmeans you can only run specifically\n\n922\n00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:08,860\napproved operating systems.\n\n923\n00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,500\nIn Windows 8, what is on the exam,\nit's an optional feature.\n\n924\n00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,730\nYou can have it or you can not.\n\n925\n00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,620\nYour system, if you want to use UEFI.\n\n926\n00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,264\nIf you want to use secure boot,\n\n927\n00:46:19,264 --> 00:46:22,156\nthen you're system,\nyour physical hardware has to support it.\n\n928\n00:46:22,156 --> 00:46:24,093\nAnd not all systems do.\n\n929\n00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:24,940\nRight?\n\n930\n00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:29,500\nA lot of the newer ones, a lot of\nthe ones made in the last like two years?\n\n931\n00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,670\nAre gonna have it, but once you get beyond\ntwo years it starts to become really iffy,\n\n932\n00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:36,160\nwhether or not your system is\ngoing to have that support or not.\n\n933\n00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,083\nNow just because you have UEFI support,\ndoesn't mean you have to use it.\n\n934\n00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,628\nSo, my laptop right now is in legacy mode,\n\n935\n00:46:41,628 --> 00:46:44,458\nwhich means I'm not using\nthe UEFI features and\n\n936\n00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:48,649\nall that, because I was running\nOpenBSD on it and it wouldn't let me.\n\n937\n00:46:48,649 --> 00:46:49,391\n>> On that?\n\n938\n00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:50,169\n>> Yeah.\n\n939\n00:46:50,169 --> 00:46:51,213\n>> Oh,

you want that feature, you do have to\nhave a system that physically supports\n\n948\n00:47:09,876 --> 00:47:11,630\nthat, and there's no way to upgrade it.\n\n949\n00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:14,232\nYou can't add UEFI support to\nhardware that doesn't have it.\n\n950\n00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:15,267\nIt's gotta be built in.\n\n951\n00:47:15,267 --> 00:47:16,764\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n952\n00:47:16,764 --> 00:47:19,480\n>> All right.\n\n953\n00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,410\nSo I think that's probably it for\nhardware.\n\n954\n00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,360\nCan you think of anything else?\n\n955\n00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,228\nYou've got to have a mouse and a keyboard.\n\n956\n00:47:27,228 --> 00:47:30,370\n[LAUGH] Microsoft used to put\nthat on the requirements.\n\n957\n00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,228\nThey'd say you gotta have a mouse and\na keyboard.\n\n958\n00:47:32,228 --> 00:47:35,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> I guess they assume we have it now.\n\n959\n00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,200\n>> What if you have a touch screen?\n\n960\n00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,410\nTouch screen monitor?\n\n961\n00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,680\n>> Maybe that's why

might be why\nthey removed that requirement.\n\n973\n00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,126\nAnd a touchscreen's\na good thing to touch on.\n\n974\n00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:07,737\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,

environment.\n\n979\n00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,330\nBut it's not required.\n\n980\n00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,300\nYou don't have to have a touch screen.\n\n981\n00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,060\nWindows 8 can fully function mouse driven,\nmouse and a keyboard.\n\n982\n00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,230\nThat's how I used it on my laptop\nwhen Windows 8 first came out, and\n\n983\n00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,430\nthen got the touch screen.\n\n984\n00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,070\nIt's kinda nice to have a touchscreen,\nit's not required.\n\n985\n00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,190\n>> Not required.\n\n986\n00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:40,120\nIt does help to give\nthe user the full Windows 8\n\n987\n00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:44,185\nexperience with all the hot corners and\ncharms

right,\n\n994\n00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,870\ncuz see, this is where hardware\nstarts to get different.\n\n995\n00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,960\nIn Windows 8, we're starting to see\na lot of laptops that are convertibles,\n\n996\n00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,700\nright, so like ours are the ones\nwhere the screen flips around and\n\n997\n00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:21,770\nthen it becomes a tablet, and I find\nthat I use the touchscreen constantly.\n\n998\n00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,690\nIf I'm in tablet mode, absolutely,\nit's the only thing you've got, right?\n\n999\n00:49:24,690 -->

than it used to be.\n\n1038\n00:51:34,149 --> 00:51:36,182\nHow many editions of Windows 7 were there?\n\n1039\n00:51:36,182 --> 00:51:37,389\n>> Quite a few.\n\n1040\n00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:40,988\nHome Premium and all sorts of stuff,\nyeah, and crazy things.\n\n1041\n00:51:40,988 --> 00:51:46,862\n>> [CROSSTALK] There was Starter,\nHome, Home Premium, there was Pro.\n\n1042\n00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:47,408\n>> Ultimate.\n\n1043\n00:51:47,408 --> 00:51:47,965\n>> Ultimate.\n\n1044\n00:51:47,965 --> 00:51:50,984\n>> Enterprise, and is that it?\n\n1045\n00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,063\nThere seems like there was another one.\n\n1046\n00:51:52,063 --> 00:51:54,385\n>> You've got like the N or K versions.\n\n1047\n00:51:54,385 --> 00:51:56,010\n>> Don't really count those might as well.\n\n1048\n00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,322\nThat's all illegal stuff.\n\n1049\n00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,784\nOh, so there are at least\nsix editions of Windows 7.\n\n1050\n00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:04,148\nWindows 8,\nthey did pare it down a bit, right.\n\n1051\n00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:07,647\nI think I got a four on the screen,\nso, so you know there's several.\n\n1052\n00:52:07,647 --> 00:52:09,272\nWe just have to figure out\nwhich one we want, right?\n\n1053\n00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:10,712\n>> Yeah.\n\n1054\n00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:12,812\nIf we're gonna be upgrading,\n\n1055\n00:52:12,812 --> 00:52:16,865\nthere's certain things that\nwe can upgrade to Windows 8.\n\n1056\n00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:19,849\nUpgrade, migrate.\n\n1057\n00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:25,003\nWindows XP, you can migrate\nto Windows 8 from Windows XP.\n\n1058\n00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:26,861\nAll it keeps is your files.\n\n1059\n00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:27,906\nThat's it.\n\n1060\n00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:33,306\nYou can migrate to Windows 8 from\nWindows Vista with Service Pack 1 and\n\n1061\n00:52:33,306 --> 00:52:36,910\nthat keeps settings and your files.\n\n1062\n00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,560\nYou can upgrade from Windows 7 and\n\n1063\n00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,910\nthat will keep some of your apps,\nsettings, and your files.\n\n1064\n00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:48,520\nAnd which one that you upgrade\nto will depend on which\n\n1065\n00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,600\nedition you're coming from.\n\n1066\n00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:56,110\n>> So just for the exam remember\nthat when we talk about a migration,\n\n1067\n00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,910\nwe're really just getting\nwhat's called our user profile.\n\n1068\n00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,980\nOur my documents folder.\n\n1069\n00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,490\nOur Internet Explorer favorite.\n\n1070\n00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,670\nLittle things like that.\n\n1071\n00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:04,440\nAnd that's it.\n\n1072\n00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,780\nNone of your programs the things you may\nhave already installed on your system.\n\n1073\n00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,840\nAll that goes away.\n\n1074\n00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,570\nSo you're effectively\ngetting a clean install, but\n\n1075\n00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,060\nit does have your files from before.\n\n1076\n00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,530\nThat's a migration.\n\n1077\n00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:20,712\nSo migrating from Windows XP and\nmigrating from Windows Vista are possible.\n\n1078\n00:53:20,712 --> 00:53:24,214\nAn upgrade is,\nwe sometimes call it an in-place upgrade,\n\n1079\n00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:28,975\nthat you're installing the new Windows 8\nsoftware right on top of Windows 7 and\n\n1080\n00:53:28,975 --> 00:53:32,967\nas a result all of the applications\nyou had installed, they stay and\n\n1081\n00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:36,629\nso you still have those programs\nwhich is kind of convenient.\n\n1082\n00:53:36,629 --> 00:53:39,670\nI'll tell you personally, I hate upgrades.\n\n1083\n00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:43,580\nI don't upgrade my machines,\nI would much rather format,\n\n1084\n00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:48,510\nget a completely blank machine, install\nthe new OS fresh and clean to ensure\n\n1085\n00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,790\nthat I'm getting a good start, and\nthen I just restore my files to it.\n\n1086\n00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:53,240\nBut that's just me personally.\n\n1087\n00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,680\nOn the exam though, be sure you know\nthe difference between an upgrade and\n\n1088\n00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,010\na migration.\n\n1089\n00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,150\n>> Yep, yep, sounds good.\n\n1090\n00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:06,070\nAll right, so those are the things\nthat we can upgrade from.\n\n1091\n00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:09,640\nNow the Windows 8 editions,\nthey're different editions.\n\n1092\n00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,885\nSo we've got Windows RT,\nWindows 8, just Windows 8.\n\n1093\n00:54:13,885 --> 00:54:15,485\nNow Windows 8, just by itself,\n\n1094\n00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:20,545\nthat would be like your home\neditions of the previous ones.\n\n1095\n00:54:20,545 --> 00:54:22,828\nThere's Windows 8 Pro, right?\n\n1096\n00:54:22,828 --> 00:54:27,010\nAnd that would be like your\nultimate editions from before.\n\n1097\n00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:30,250\nAnd then we've got Windows 8 Enterprise.\n\n1098\n00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:34,514\nAnd that'll be like through\nEnterprise one from before.\n\n1099\n00:54:34,514 --> 00:54:37,920\n>> [LAUGH] Now if it sounds\nconfusing that's because it is.\n\n1100\n00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,240\nAnd everybody recognizes this,\neven Microsoft.\n\n1101\n00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,534\nIt is on the exam.\n\n1102\n00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:45,882\nSo what Microsoft did is they\nreleased a Technet article.\n\n1103\n00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,910\nAnd if you've never heard of Technet,\nthat's Microsoft's special site.\n\n1104\n00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:54,935\nIt's technet.microsoft.com, where they\nhave all sorts of technical details for\n\n1105\n00:54:54,935 --> 00:54:59,328\npeople like us, people that are IT people,\nthat work on these computers,\n\n1106\n00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:01,670\nthat need to know the ins and outs.\n\n1107\n00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,260\nYour average home user doesn't\neven know any of this stuff.\n\n1108\n00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,880\nSo they stash it away on a separate site.\n\n1109\n00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,936\nBut there's a great TechNet article,\nlet me just bring it up here.\n\n1110\n00:55:08,936 --> 00:55:13,616\nAnd it's titled Windows 8 Edition's SKUs.\n\n1111\n00:55:13,616 --> 00:55:17,017\nSKUs, and you know what SKU stands for?\n\n1112\n00:55:17,017 --> 00:55:18,805\n>> Stock keeping unit.\n\n1113\n00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:20,361\n>> Nice.\n\n1114\n00:55:20,361 --> 00:55:22,880\nSKU, that's a term that comes from retail,\nright?\n\n1115\n00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,235\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So grocery stores,\n\n1116\n00:55:25,235 --> 00:55:28,022\nany kinda department store.\n\n1117\n00:55:28,022 --> 00:55:32,339\nWhen you go to buy a t-shirt, it's got\na bar code on it and that's the SKU for\n\n1118\n00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:33,839\nthat item to identify it.\n\n1119\n00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,670\nSo Microsoft calls their\nversions of Windows 8 the SKU.\n\n1120\n00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,570\n>> I imagine they have\nbar codes somewhere.\n\n1121\n00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:39,410\nI've never seen it.\n\n1122\n00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,380\n>> Maybe on the box.\n\n1123\n00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,408\nBut, I think using the whole\nSKU is kind of skewed.\n\n1124\n00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:46,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, that was a stretch.\n\n1125\n00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:47,880\n>> You tried.\n\n1126\n00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,840\nSo, with Windows 8,\n\n1127\n00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,560\nwe've got four editions that we\nneed to know for the exam, and\n\n1128\n00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,710\nMicrosoft breaks it down right here\ninto a nice little table for us.\n\n1129\n00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:01,080\nMay list the four editions\nthat Nate mentioned.\n\n1130\n00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,666\nWell, Nate mentioned the three\nthat we care about, and\n\n1131\n00:56:02,666 --> 00:56:03,997\nthere's the fourth one\nwe don't care about.\n\n1132\n00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:08,352\nSo we got Windows 8, which is basically\nfor your home user, right, just for\n\n1133\n00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:12,506\nyour regular average Joe, or may be\neven a small business, but really for\n\n1134\n00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:13,648\njust the home user.\n\n1135\n00:56:13,648 --> 00:56:18,371\nThen you got Windows 8 Professional,\nwhich adds some functionality specifically\n\n1136\n00:56:18,371 --> 00:56:23,450\ndesigned for businesses, small\nbusinesses and medium-sized businesses.\n\n1137\n00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:25,620\nAnd then, you got Windows 8 Enterprise,\n\n1138\n00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,400\nwhich adds features for well, big\nbusinesses, people who have thousands of\n\n1139\n00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,920\ncomputers that have a certain special need\nto support that large of an environment.\n\n1140\n00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,120\nAnd then lastly, over here in the corner,\nI've got Windows RT.\n\n1141\n00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,050\nWindows RT, that's that one designed for\ntablets and mobile computing.\n\n1142\n00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,610\nIt's designed to run on ARM processors,\nright?\n\n1143\n00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:50,350\nThe other three, Windows 8,\nWindows 8 Pro, and Windows 8 Enterprise,\n\n1144\n00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,660\nthose run on Intel x86 and\nAMD64 hardware, right.\n\n1145\n00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,750\nNormal desktop processors.\n\n1146\n00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,270\nThey do not run on ARM.\n\n1147\n00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,785\nWindows RT is the only one that does.\n\n1148\n00:56:59,785 --> 00:57:01,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1149\n00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,740\nYep, that's right.\n\n1150\n00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,450\nSo, different editions.\n\n1151\n00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,540\nWe get different features into it.\n\n1152\n00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,840\nJust straight up Windows 8,\nlittle strip down.\n\n1153\n00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,217\nJust get what you need\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1154\n00:57:12,217 --> 00:57:16,767\n>> And get into Windows Pro, and\nthat adds things like BitLocker and\n\n1155\n00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:21,580\nBitLocker to go, which is your\nfull drive and encryption stuff.\n\n1156\n00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,990\nWe get boot from VHD,\nwhich is pretty cool.\n\n1157\n00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,360\nWe'll see that here in a bit.\n\n1158\n00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,790\nYou get that with Window's 8 Pro.\n\n1159\n00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:30,720\nYou get client Hyper-V.\n\n1160\n00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,760\nSo we'll be seeing that\nhere too in a little bit.\n\n1161\n00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,050\nYou can join a domain with Pro.\n\n1162\n00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,512\nAnd that could be useful,\nif you need to join a domain.\n\n1163\n00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:44,196\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you get EFS, encrypting file\n\n1164\n00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:49,416\nsystem, and able to secure your\nstuff on a file and folder level.\n\n1165\n00:57:49,416 --> 00:57:54,363\nAnd last, you get group policy stuff which\nwould go in with your domain things and\n\n1166\n00:57:54,363 --> 00:57:56,777\nthat's with, yeah, Windows 8 Pro.\n\n1167\n00:57:56,777 --> 00:58:01,477\n>> And if you're not familiar with\nthose features, well almost all of them\n\n1168\n00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:06,660\nwere centered around this idea of stuff\nthat a business might need, right?\n\n1169\n00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:12,210\nSo like Nate mentioned, BitLocker and\nEFS, EFS the encrypting file system.\n\n1170\n00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:15,150\nThose both allow us to\nencrypt our storage, so\n\n1171\n00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,280\nthat if somebody were to steal our hard\ndrives they could get at our data.\n\n1172\n00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,990\nYour regular home user is not\nreally worried about that.\n\n1173\n00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:24,110\nA business user is, so\nthat's a Pro feature.\n\n1174\n00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,780\nJoining a domain, joining a domain is\nwhere you have a centralized pool of\n\n1175\n00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,790\nuser accounts, and that means you've got\na server, a directory server somewhere.\n\n1176\n00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,350\nA home user is not going to have that.\n\n1177\n00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:34,270\nThey don't need it.\n\n1178\n00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,130\nBut a business user may,\nand so they do need that.\n\n1179\n00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,570\nSo, the idea is if your a home user,\n\n1180\n00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:42,780\nthere's a lot of features you don't\nneed you can save some money,\n\n1181\n00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,425\nyou can get the regular edition\nof Windows 8 for a lower cost.\n\n1182\n00:58:46,425 --> 00:58:47,450\nRight?\n\n1183\n00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:52,430\nAnd not pay so much or you can go up to\nWindows 8 Pro and pay some extra, and\n\n1184\n00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,165\nthen you get those extra business\nfeatures that you need, right?\n\n1185\n00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1186\n00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,380\n>> The third edition is Windows 8\nEnterprise, and Windows 8 Enterprise,\n\n1187\n00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,390\nyou cannot buy.\n\n1188\n00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,660\nYou can't just go to the store and\nbuy it off the shelf.\n\n1189\n00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,950\nYou get Window 8 Enterprise,\n\n1190\n00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:09,470\nif you are a Microsoft Volume\nLicense Agreement partner right?\n\n1191\n00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:14,545\nVolume license partners are people\nwho run so many copies of Windows.\n\n1192\n00:59:14,545 --> 00:59:15,650\nRight?\n\n1193\n00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:19,790\nHundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of\ncopies of Windows, that instead of going\n\n1194\n00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:23,390\nand buying them from retail outlets,\nthey buy them directly from Microsoft and\n\n1195\n00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,500\nthey usually get a substantial\ndiscount from that.\n\n1196\n00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,450\nAnd they get other things,\n\n1197\n00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:30,802\nlike free upgrades and,\nwell free as long as you pay.\n\n1198\n00:59:30,802 --> 00:59:31,673\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Whatever.\n\n1199\n00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:34,320\nBut you get your upgrades,\nand so there's a lot\n\n1200\n00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,210\nof stuff there that's really useful for\nenterprises, for big businesses.\n\n1201\n00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,610\nAnd so the Enterprise edition is for them.\n\n1202\n00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,580\nThere's not really all that much\nfeature wise that Windows 8 Enterprise\n\n1203\n00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,070\ngets that Pro does it, right.\n\n1204\n00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:50,670\nLet's go back to this this little\nchart that Microsoft put on TechNet.\n\n1205\n00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,731\nSo they've got little X's here indicating\nfeatures that are available in one or\n\n1206\n00:59:54,731 --> 00:59:55,336\nthe other.\n\n1207\n00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:58,421\nAnd if we compare Windows 8 Pro and\nWindows 8 Enterprise and\n\n1208\n00:59:58,421 --> 01:00:02,000\nwe go down the line, they are almost\nidentical all the way down there.\n\n1209\n01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,880\nThere is a little difference\nwhen it comes to the languages.\n\n1210\n01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,120\nLet's see, here we go.\n\n1211\n01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:14,240\nWell, like Windows to Go is a Windows 8\nEnterprise feature and not Windows 8 Pro.\n\n1212\n01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:20,300\nDirectAccess, BranchCache, and AppLocker,\nthose are all services Pro for providing\n\n1213\n01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:25,200\nconnectivity to people at branch offices\nor remote tower workers and things.\n\n1214\n01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,930\nAnd the same thing with VDI\nwhich we don't really get into.\n\n1215\n01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:30,660\nNot on the exam.\n\n1216\n01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:35,913\nThat's if you have virtual desktops and\nWindows 8 app deployment for\n\n1217\n01:00:35,913 --> 01:00:40,910\nloading modern UI stuff without\nusing the Windows Store, right?\n\n1218\n01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,890\nWhich they require in the other editions.\n\n1219\n01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,130\n>> Side load.\n\n1220\n01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:44,800\n>> Side loading, yep.\n\n1221\n01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,790\n>> Yep, sideloading apps.\n\n1222\n01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:47,950\nYep, you need Enterprise to do that.\n\n1223\n01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:48,500\n>> Yep.\n\n1224\n01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,310\nSo, those are some of the things\nthat you get with Enterprise.\n\n1225\n01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,790\nThe big difference, though, which I'm\nsurprised they don't even mention here,\n\n1226\n01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,430\nis the multi-language user interface.\n\n1227\n01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:02,600\nWith Windows 8 Enterprise,\nyou get all the language packs,\n\n1228\n01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,490\nand you know, am I wrong, Nate?\n\n1229\n01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,010\nThey're listing it here for\nall the editions.\n\n1230\n01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,850\nDo they include it with all of them now?\n\n1231\n01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,770\n>> Well, I guess so.\n\n1232\n01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:10,700\nLooks like it.\n\n1233\n01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,250\n>> I'll have to double check that because\nit used to be, under Windows 7, that when\n\n1234\n01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:18,460\nyou went Enterprise, that was when you got\nall the languages for the user interface.\n\n1235\n01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:23,360\nBut, if you went with Pro or Home or\nwhatever, you only got the language for\n\n1236\n01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,960\nthe country where you bought the software.\n\n1237\n01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,960\nSo if you bought it in\nthe US you only got English.\n\n1238\n01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,220\nIf you bought it in Canada\nyou got English and French.\n\n1239\n01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,370\nIf you bought it in France\nyou only got French.\n\n1240\n01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:35,680\nBut in Enterprise, you always got all\nthe languages which was kind of neat.\n\n1241\n01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,444\nAccording to this it's now in all of them.\n\n1242\n01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:42,338\n>> Yep and with Enterprise we\nmentioned volume licensing things\n\n1243\n01:01:42,338 --> 01:01:44,910\nthat software assurance.\n\n1244\n01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,516\nNumbers is another word for it,\nI see them throwing out there.\n\n1245\n01:01:48,516 --> 01:01:51,460\nSo if you're a Software Assurance,\nmember, client, whatever,\n\n1246\n01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,130\nthen that would give you\naccess to that stuff.\n\n1247\n01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,900\n>> So Software Assurance is actually a\nfeature of your volume license agreement.\n\n1248\n01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,490\nSo when you enroll in\na Volume License program,\n\n1249\n01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:02,160\nyou can choose to purchase\nSoftware Assurance or not.\n\n1250\n01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,150\nAnd what it is is the remedy\nfree upgrade I mentioned.\n\n1251\n01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:10,190\nIf you do Software Assurance, as long\nas you keep your agreement current,\n\n1252\n01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,100\nin other words, as long as you pay.\n\n1253\n01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,862\nAnd a new version of Windows comes out,\n\n1254\n01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:15,814\nyou can upgrade to that one without\npurchasing another license.\n\n1255\n01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:17,393\nThat's what Software Assurance is.\n\n1256\n01:02:17,393 --> 01:02:20,238\nSo you'll hear people use\nthe terms interchangeably,\n\n1257\n01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:23,021\nbut the Volume License Agreement\nis the contract, and\n\n1258\n01:02:23,021 --> 01:02:26,040\nsoftware insurance is\na feature of that contract.\n\n1259\n01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,490\nYeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1260\n01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,304\nYep.\n\n1261\n01:02:28,304 --> 01:02:32,483\nAll right, so, we're just about ready to\nget into actually installing Windows 8.\n\n1262\n01:02:32,483 --> 01:02:34,805\nWe'll get it going before the break.\n\n1263\n01:02:34,805 --> 01:02:35,699\nSo we'll take a little bit of time.\n\n1264\n01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:36,442\n>> Sure.\n\n1265\n01:02:36,442 --> 01:02:38,868\n>> There are, yeah, quickly.\n\n1266\n01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:42,827\nSome, Windows 8 specific\nhardware requirement.\n\n1267\n01:02:42,827 --> 01:02:47,951\nSo, you mentioned the UEFI BIOS\nwith a secure boot process,\n\n1268\n01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:52,900\na TPM is called out for\nthe full BitLocker support.\n\n1269\n01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:57,270\nTo get that, you have to have a TPM chip,\ntrusted platform module, and\n\n1270\n01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:02,070\nit stores certificates or\nyour BitLocker key and thing.\n\n1271\n01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:07,900\nNow, if a computer is listed\nas Windows 8 certified,\n\n1272\n01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,780\nthen it will have that UEFI And\nNTP and onto it, so it's certified.\n\n1273\n01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,390\nNow, some will say Windows 8 ready and\nit just creates, or just has,\n\n1274\n01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,200\na little header.\n\n1275\n01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,950\nYou can buy your own TPM and\nput it in there.\n\n1276\n01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:21,670\nBut, yeah, about the same thing.\n\n1277\n01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,050\nYep.\nAnd then, of course,\n\n1278\n01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,490\nif you want to run Hyper-V,\n\n1279\n01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:27,796\nthen you need 64-bit with second\nlayer address translation.\n\n1280\n01:03:27,796 --> 01:03:32,138\n>> That's right, the second level address\ntranslation or, isn't it second level?\n\n1281\n01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:33,311\n>> Layer, level?\n\n1282\n01:03:33,311 --> 01:03:34,693\n>> Well, let's find out, now I'm curious.\n\n1283\n01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:36,874\nI always thought it was second level.\n\n1284\n01:03:36,874 --> 01:03:38,197\n>> What did I call it?\n\n1285\n01:03:38,197 --> 01:03:39,532\n>> Second layer.\n\n1286\n01:03:39,532 --> 01:03:41,436\n>> Oh, well layer and\nlevel it's kinda the same.\n\n1287\n01:03:41,436 --> 01:03:43,235\n>> No, you're totally wrong.\n\n1288\n01:03:43,235 --> 01:03:45,811\n>> What is it?\n>> It's second level, so.\n\n1289\n01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:46,694\n>> That's what I said.\n\n1290\n01:03:46,694 --> 01:03:50,087\n>> Okay, so\nsecond level address translation,\n\n1291\n01:03:50,087 --> 01:03:54,002\nI'm glad you mentioned it\nbecause I forgot about it.\n\n1292\n01:03:54,002 --> 01:03:56,847\nIf you want to run virtualization, right?\n\n1293\n01:03:56,847 --> 01:03:59,737\nIf you want to run Hyper-V for\nexample, or really anything.\n\n1294\n01:03:59,737 --> 01:04:01,420\nA virtual box, whatever.\n\n1295\n01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:05,680\nTechnically the only thing you need,\nis a processor that supports,\n\n1296\n01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,370\nthey call it hardware acceleration, or HA.\n\n1297\n01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:11,820\nIntel refers to that as VT-x.\n\n1298\n01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,873\nSo on an Intel processor, software VT-x.\n\n1299\n01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:18,529\nAMD calls it AMDV, so\nwith Intel VT-x virtualization\n\n1300\n01:04:18,529 --> 01:04:21,980\ntechnology extensions, and with AMD.\n\n1301\n01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:25,657\nAMD-V is just AMD virtualization.\n\n1302\n01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:31,430\nSo your processor has to support that\njust to be able to do virtualization.\n\n1303\n01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:34,147\nWell, on Windows Server that's true.\n\n1304\n01:04:34,147 --> 01:04:37,674\nBut on Windows 8,\nthere's an extra requirement.\n\n1305\n01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:42,959\nNot only do you have to have VTX or AMD-V,\ndepending on which vendor your processor\n\n1306\n01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:48,270\nis, you also have to have SLAT,\nwhich is Second Level Address Translation.\n\n1307\n01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:53,670\nAnd it is a special way for handling\nmemory access for virtual machines.\n\n1308\n01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:58,090\nIt does make a huge difference as\nfar as the performance of your VMs.\n\n1309\n01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,500\nYour VMs will run\nconsiderably faster with it.\n\n1310\n01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:06,120\nWithout it, well, there's certain\nlimitations to the amount of memory access\n\n1311\n01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,700\nthe VMs can have as far as\nlike doing video acceleration.\n\n1312\n01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,145\nSo high end graphics acceleration is not\nreally possible in a VM without it, and so\n\n1313\n01:05:13,145 --> 01:05:15,215\nin Windows 8 they made it a requirement.\n\n1314\n01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:18,305\nAnd that really annoyed a lot of people,\nthis guy,\n\n1315\n01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:22,680\nbecause in Server 2012 you don't have that\nrequirement, but in Windows 8 you do.\n\n1316\n01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,270\nIt's the same version of Hyper-V.\n\n1317\n01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:27,330\nSo they really just imposed\nthat requirement in Windows 8.\n\n1318\n01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:29,230\nBut it is there, yeah.\n\n1319\n01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:30,570\n>> Yep.\n\n1320\n01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:34,798\nAll right, so I think we know what\nedition that we wanna run now.\n\n1321\n01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:39,010\nEnterprise looks pretty sweet,\nI think we'll run that.\n\n1322\n01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,979\n>> And for\nthose of you guys studying at home,\n\n1323\n01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:46,611\nremember said that you can't go and\nbuy Enterprise off the shelf.\n\n1324\n01:05:46,611 --> 01:05:47,929\nBut studying for the exam,\n\n1325\n01:05:47,929 --> 01:05:51,150\nEnterprise is the best one to use\ncuz it supports all the features.\n\n1326\n01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,290\nIt has everything in it.\n\n1327\n01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,690\nSo what do you do?\n\n1328\n01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:55,720\nGo to Microsoft's website.\n\n1329\n01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,810\nYou can download a 90 day evaluation\ncopy of Windows 8, Enterprise edition.\n\n1330\n01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:02,577\nYou can then run it for 90 days, and\n\n1331\n01:06:02,577 --> 01:06:06,000\nat the end of 90 days you can delete\nthe machine and create a new one, or\n\n1332\n01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,334\nreinstall over it and reset that\nperiod and go for another 90 days.\n\n1333\n01:06:09,334 --> 01:06:14,380\nSo as far as learning, that evaluation\ncopy is a really wonderful resource\n\n1334\n01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,620\n>> Yeah, I agree.\n\n1335\n01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,262\n>> All right, so Nate,\nwhat are you gonna do?\n\n1336\n01:06:18,262 --> 01:06:20,100\nYou gonna fire up a virtual machine for\nus?\n\n1337\n01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,780\n>> Yeah, I will.\n\n1338\n01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,225\nI have one here.\n\n1339\n01:06:24,225 --> 01:06:28,968\nHyper-V Manager.\n\n1340\n01:06:28,968 --> 01:06:35,620\nSo we're gonna do a install to VHD and\nboot from it too.\n\n1341\n01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:41,260\nSo it's one of the things called out in\nthere on stuff that you'll need to do.\n\n1342\n01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:44,682\n>> Yeah, now if we were installing\nthis on a physical machine, you go and\n\n1343\n01:06:44,682 --> 01:06:47,180\nyou buy Windows and\nWindows comes on a DVD, right?\n\n1344\n01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,370\nA physical disk.\n\n1345\n01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,430\nAnd so you pop that DVD in and\nthen boot on it.\n\n1346\n01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,590\nInstalling in a virtual machine,\nyou use a virtual disk.\n\n1347\n01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:58,080\nAnd so, Nate's gotta virtual disk\nimage stuck in the machine, and\n\n1348\n01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,900\nhe's gonna fire up and boot up off of it.\n\n1349\n01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:05,110\nLooks like Windows 8's already installed.\n\n1350\n01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:06,650\n>> What?\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1351\n01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:10,800\nWe're gonna install it on a VHD\nfrom this one and then boot to it.\n\n1352\n01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,950\nTo show the little boot menu.\n\n1353\n01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:13,560\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n1354\n01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:21,210\nAll right, so on a standard install\nyou're gonna boot from the disk.\n\n1355\n01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:24,040\nAnd then you'll go directly\ninto the installer.\n\n1356\n01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,030\nNow, Nate's going about it a slightly\ndifferent way here in that he's gonna\n\n1357\n01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:28,210\ninstall to a VHD.\n\n1358\n01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,750\nNow we haven't talked about that yet, so\n\n1359\n01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,540\nlet's talk a little bit\nabout what Nate's doing.\n\n1360\n01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,870\nNormally when we install Windows,\nwe install to a hard drive, right?\n\n1361\n01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:38,410\nTo an actual hard drive on our system.\n\n1362\n01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:41,370\nBoot from VHD is a neat\nfeature that was introduced.\n\n1363\n01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:43,340\nIt was introduced in Windows 7 or Vista?\n\n1364\n01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,655\nI think it was introduced in 7.\n\n1365\n01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,550\nDoesn't matter.\n\n1366\n01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:50,020\nIt's in Windows 8, so\nwe need to know it for the exam, right?\n\n1367\n01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:55,500\nSo what it does, it allows you to create\nVHDs, which are virtual hard drives.\n\n1368\n01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,350\nAnd I do this on my own machine.\n\n1369\n01:07:57,350 --> 01:08:00,045\nSo my laptop that I use\nin all these shows,\n\n1370\n01:08:00,045 --> 01:08:04,050\nwhen I boot it up,\nI actually have two choices.\n\n1371\n01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:07,680\nI can boot to my personal machine,\nwhich is where all my stuff is, or\n\n1372\n01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,310\nI can boot to my studio virtual hard\ndrive and that's my ITproTV system.\n\n1373\n01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,470\nSo I have one laptop, but\n\n1374\n01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:19,310\nit has two different roles that\nI can boot into and go at.\n\n1375\n01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:20,350\nReally, really useful.\n\n1376\n01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,460\nFor a home user, not useful at all, right?\n\n1377\n01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:26,290\nBut for a business user that\nmight be using their laptop for\n\n1378\n01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:28,520\nmore than one purpose, it's very handy.\n\n1379\n01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:33,020\nThe cool thing about a VHD is you can\ninstall a nice clean new operating system\n\n1380\n01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,790\nwithout overwriting your base OS.\n\n1381\n01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:38,950\nAnd so it's a really cool feature.\n\n1382\n01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:39,870\nAnd it's really neat.\n\n1383\n01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:40,830\nBut you know what Nate?\n\n1384\n01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,870\nThe more I think about it,\nif I'm new to Windows 8,\n\n1385\n01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,750\nthis is not what I'm gonna be doing.\n\n1386\n01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,410\nSo let's start with a standard install\nfirst and then we'll come back and\n\n1387\n01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:50,540\ntackle the VHD one.\n\n1388\n01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,690\nDo you have a standard install?\n\n1389\n01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:54,740\nI can fire one up real quick.\n\n1390\n01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,660\n>> Yeah.\n\n1391\n01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,680\nIf you can fire up one.\n\n1392\n01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,330\nYeah, this is kind of.\n\n1393\n01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:02,970\n>> Yeah, let me just fire up.\n\n1394\n01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:05,290\nWe'll kinda do a standard install here.\n\n1395\n01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:10,405\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna fire up a machine,\n\n1396\n01:09:10,405 --> 01:09:13,475\nand Jason if you can fire up my computer.\n\n1397\n01:09:13,475 --> 01:09:17,885\nSo I'm gonna whip up a virtual machine,\nand when we build a virtual machine,\n\n1398\n01:09:17,885 --> 01:09:20,415\njust like a real machine we've\ngotta pick the right hardware.\n\n1399\n01:09:20,415 --> 01:09:22,115\nRight?\nSo I need to pick the amount of memory I\n\n1400\n01:09:22,115 --> 01:09:23,590\nneed and stuff like that.\n\n1401\n01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:27,060\nI'm just gonna give this\nmachine 2 gigs of memory.\n\n1402\n01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,900\nRemember 2 gigs was the minimum\nrecommended requirement for\n\n1403\n01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:36,490\nWindows 8, 64-bit edition, so\nI'm just gonna do 2 gigs of memory and\n\n1404\n01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,760\nI need to create a hard drive,\nlet me do that.\n\n1405\n01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:47,000\nThe hard drive required me to have a 20\ngig hard drive, right, for 64 bit?\n\n1406\n01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,140\nBut I'm gonna go bigger.\n\n1407\n01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:51,342\nLet's go like, 64 gigs.\n\n1408\n01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:55,690\nAll right.\n\n1409\n01:09:55,690 --> 01:10:01,208\nNow, if I fire up a brand new machine,\nit's got a blank hard drive, right?\n\n1410\n01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:04,470\nIt's not gonna be able to boot from that,\nand so I'm gonna boot from my Windows 8\n\n1411\n01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:06,770\ndisk image, so\nlet me just get that loaded up here.\n\n1412\n01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,095\nI'm gonna do Windows 8 Enterprise.\n\n1413\n01:10:18,372 --> 01:10:20,637\nWhoops.\n\n1414\n01:10:20,637 --> 01:10:21,400\nThere we go.\n\n1415\n01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,420\nAll right.\n\n1416\n01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,271\nSo, we've take a machine, basically\nwe pop our DVD into the drive, and\n\n1417\n01:10:28,271 --> 01:10:29,780\nwe boot off of it.\n\n1418\n01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,600\nWhen we boot off of it,\nit's gonna start our standard install, and\n\n1419\n01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,740\nthis is basically what our\nstandard install looks like.\n\n1420\n01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,380\nAnd why is it not scaling for me?\n\n1421\n01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,390\nIf I click on the right thing,\nthere we go.\n\n1422\n01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,820\nAll right, so our standard\ninstall basically boots up and\n\n1423\n01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:45,650\nit asks us just a handful of questions.\n\n1424\n01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:49,080\nJust enough to be able to get\nWindows 8 up and running, right?\n\n1425\n01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:52,670\nSo it's gonna ask us what\nlanguage do we speak, right?\n\n1426\n01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,390\nAnd since I bought this\ncopy in the United States,\n\n1427\n01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,430\nit defaults to English, United States.\n\n1428\n01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:02,030\nIf you buy a copy in France, it'll default\nto France and French and all that, right?\n\n1429\n01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:03,830\nIt's regionalized.\n\n1430\n01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,650\nSo I'm gonna go with English.\n\n1431\n01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,700\nIf I drop it down,\nI don't even have any other choices here.\n\n1432\n01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,650\nWell, I guess I have more for\ntime and currency,\n\n1433\n01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,170\nbut languages I've only\ngot English to pick from.\n\n1434\n01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,370\nBut you can get, what are they?\n\n1435\n01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:21,370\nMUI, Multi User Interface disks,\nwhich have all the languages.\n\n1436\n01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:23,410\nAll right, so I'm just gonna hit Next.\n\n1437\n01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:26,500\nIt's gonna ask me what I want to do,\nand install now is what I want.\n\n1438\n01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,040\nIf I have a computer that's acting up,\nwe've got repair and\n\n1439\n01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,650\nwe'll tackle that one later on\nin the maintenance episodes.\n\n1440\n01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:34,230\nBut for\nright now I'm just gonna do an install.\n\n1441\n01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:39,460\nAnd once we start the install it doesn't\nreally ask us a whole lot of questions.\n\n1442\n01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:42,230\nIt is gonna ask us where we\nwant to install it to, so\n\n1443\n01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,100\nI have to pick a hard drive, right?\n\n1444\n01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,460\nI've only got one hard drive in here,\nso it's not really much of a choice.\n\n1445\n01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,530\nI need to accept my\nlicense agreement here,\n\n1446\n01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,970\nyou know you have an end\nuser license agreement.\n\n1447\n01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,120\nAnd it will vary based on\nthe edition of Windows that you got.\n\n1448\n01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:59,580\nThen I need to pick if I'm\nupgrading an existing system or\n\n1449\n01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,490\nif I'm doing a custom install.\n\n1450\n01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:04,360\nNow, I hate this terminology\nthat they use, a custom install.\n\n1451\n01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:09,365\nWhen you choose custom, what they really\nmean is a clean new installation, right?\n\n1452\n01:12:09,365 --> 01:12:14,060\n>> Yep, clean installation and\na lot of cases, yeah I think that's what\n\n1453\n01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:18,490\nyou would encounter most is\nclean installs on things.\n\n1454\n01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:20,959\nOf course, you know you do need\nto be aware of both of them.\n\n1455\n01:12:20,959 --> 01:12:23,771\nBut since we have a clean\nfresh hard drive,\n\n1456\n01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:26,749\nwe're gonna go with a custom installation.\n\n1457\n01:12:26,749 --> 01:12:29,862\n>> Yep, and so\neven though it's not really custom,\n\n1458\n01:12:29,862 --> 01:12:33,730\nthat's what we have to choose,\nso weird terminology there.\n\n1459\n01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:35,210\nI'm going to choose custom.\n\n1460\n01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,100\nAnd now it's going to ask\nme where I want to install.\n\n1461\n01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,360\nI've only got one hard drive,\nand so I'll choose it.\n\n1462\n01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,960\nIf you have multiple hard drives,\nyou can pick which one and\n\n1463\n01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,880\nyou can even go into drive options,\nand you can create partitions.\n\n1464\n01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:50,570\nSo maybe I don't want to use the entire\n64 gig drive, I could create a partition\n\n1465\n01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:55,230\nlike, maybe for whatever reason,\nI just want to use 60 gigs.\n\n1466\n01:12:55,230 --> 01:13:01,330\nSo I could come in here and\nspecify a 60 gig, there we go.\n\n1467\n01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:03,900\nAnd so it'll specify 60 and\nleave the remainder empty, and\n\n1468\n01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:09,930\nnotice how it created another partition\nalso, 350 megs, what is that for?\n\n1469\n01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:15,160\nWell, Bitlocker support, right, I may\nnot choose to run Bitlocker today, but\n\n1470\n01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,010\nI might choose to do it a month from now.\n\n1471\n01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:20,450\nIn order to do Bitlocker, you have to have\na small partition at the beginning of\n\n1472\n01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:23,620\nthe drive that is formatted FAT32,\nall right?\n\n1473\n01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,930\nIt's gotta be that way so\nthat the system can boot up and\n\n1474\n01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:27,800\nrecognize that it's running BitLocker.\n\n1475\n01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,050\nYou also need that if you're\ngonna be doing UEFI boot, right?\n\n1476\n01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,950\nIf you've got UEFI bios,\n\n1477\n01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:38,020\nUEFI bios will only boot from FAT32\npartitions, it won't boot from NTSF.\n\n1478\n01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:41,660\nSo you need that special partition there,\nso either way, it's going to be there.\n\n1479\n01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,760\nAnd that's why Windows 8 makes it.\n\n1480\n01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:45,460\nAll right.\nSo anyway,\n\n1481\n01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:48,110\nI'm going to choose\nthe partition that I made.\n\n1482\n01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:49,360\nLike I said, I didn't have to make one.\n\n1483\n01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,380\nI could have just picked the drive and\nit would have made it for me.\n\n1484\n01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,940\nIt would have just used the whole drive.\n\n1485\n01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:55,770\nAnd now we hit next.\n\n1486\n01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:56,900\nAnd the install starts.\n\n1487\n01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,700\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's it.\n\n1488\n01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,860\nThere we go.\n\n1489\n01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:02,990\n>> Yeah, really, it is considerably\nsimpler than earlier editions\n\n1490\n01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:03,910\n>> Sections of Windows,\n\n1491\n01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:05,000\nwe don't get many questions.\n\n1492\n01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,750\nIt didn't even ask us for a product key.\n\n1493\n01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:10,730\nIt's going to install and go into a grace\nperiod so we can run without a product key\n\n1494\n01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:16,190\nfor a period of time without\nburning up one of our licenses.\n\n1495\n01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:19,960\n>> And they install here so\nit's coming from a WIM file.\n\n1496\n01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,350\nAnd the way it was kind of\nexplained to me was just neat.\n\n1497\n01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:25,560\nWindows eight it installs quicker.\n\n1498\n01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,950\nAnd so it kind of takes this WIM file and\nmore or\n\n1499\n01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:33,120\nless unpacks it and then just copies it,\ncomes over to your hard drive.\n\n1500\n01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,940\nAnd then when you boot up,\n>> It you know then you gotta configure\n\n1501\n01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:40,740\nyour profiles and do that whole thing so\nunlike previous installation of Windows\n\n1502\n01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:45,150\nwhere during the installation you had to\n>> You know, do your time and\n\n1503\n01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,180\nall that other stuff.\n\n1504\n01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,360\nThat is now after the fact.\n\n1505\n01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:51,040\nSo it copies it down, and\nthen, yeah, then you move on.\n\n1506\n01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,300\n>> And it really does make things faster.\n\n1507\n01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,910\nIf you look, like my installation,\n\n1508\n01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:59,400\nit's already 35% through on copying the\nfiles and getting ready for the install.\n\n1509\n01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,880\nSo it can install considerably faster.\n\n1510\n01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,130\nIf you take like Windows XP,\n\n1511\n01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:06,560\nsetting up a Windows XP machine is\ngoing to take you at least an hour.\n\n1512\n01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,560\nA Windows 8 machine,\nusually ten to fifteen minutes.\n\n1513\n01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,185\nMuch, much faster on the install.\n\n1514\n01:15:11,185 --> 01:15:12,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1515\n01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:15,230\n>> All right, well I hate sitting\nhere watching progress bars,\n\n1516\n01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:17,110\nand we are basically at our break time.\n\n1517\n01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,115\nSo why don't we stop here?\n\n1518\n01:15:18,115 --> 01:15:19,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And we'll take a break, and\n\n1519\n01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:22,540\nwhen we get back, this install should be\ndone, and we'll be able to see some of\n\n1520\n01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,745\nthe first steps to getting\na Windows 8 machine set up.\n\n1521\n01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:26,760\n>> Mm-hm, yep, sounds good.\n\n1522\n01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,280\n>> All right, so stay tuned.\n\n1523\n01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,831\nWe'll be back in a few minutes.\n\n1524\n01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:37,645\n[MUSIC]\n\n1525\n01:15:37,645 --> 01:15:39,500\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1526\n01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:47,510\nWe're back to the fourth,\nour last segment for our show today.\n\n1527\n01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:54,430\nAll right, where we left off last with\ninstalling Windows 8 on Don's machine.\n\n1528\n01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:57,350\nAnd so during the break it\nfinished installing, and so\n\n1529\n01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:59,720\nnow the machine restarted.\n\n1530\n01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:05,010\nAnd so now we're in the personalization\nsteps to finish setting it up.\n\n1531\n01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:07,150\n>> And this happened just\na couple of minutes after break.\n\n1532\n01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:10,940\nIt didn't take too long to finish\nit's little install, and reboot.\n\n1533\n01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:13,480\nAnd now it's going to ask us some\nhard hitting questions, right?\n\n1534\n01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,260\nLike what do I want to name the machine?\n\n1535\n01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,720\nSo I'll just call it my ITProTV-VM, right?\n\n1536\n01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:22,340\nSo we gotta pick a name,\nwe gotta pick our color scheme, right?\n\n1537\n01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,860\nLet's pick something that's\nnot too terribly atrocious.\n\n1538\n01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,380\nAnd, yeah, so we'll go gray and orange.\n\n1539\n01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,770\nAnd so\nwe'll pick that Then it's gonna ask us\n\n1540\n01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:35,800\nabout how we want to set up our\nsystem as far as Windows updates and\n\n1541\n01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,610\ncookie tracking and\nInternet Explorer page rendering.\n\n1542\n01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:43,080\nWe can go through and customize all these\nif we want, that's the customize button,\n\n1543\n01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,675\nor we can just say use express settings,\nwhich is what I'm gonna go with.\n\n1544\n01:16:45,675 --> 01:16:47,520\nMm-hm.\n\n1545\n01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,640\n>> We talked about, in the beginning\nof the show, how in Windows 8,\n\n1546\n01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,190\nnow we can log in with\na Microsoft Live account.\n\n1547\n01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,070\nRight?\nA Hotmail or Outlook.com or\n\n1548\n01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:55,260\nwhatever account.\n\n1549\n01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,460\nIf you've already got one,\n\n1550\n01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:59,500\nyou can choose to sign in with\na Microsoft account right here.\n\n1551\n01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:03,950\nIf you don't have one, you can choose to\nsign up for a new email address also.\n\n1552\n01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:07,850\nOkay, in my case,\nI don't really want to do either, right?\n\n1553\n01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:10,580\nSo actually that's not sign in with,\nthat's sign in without, and\n\n1554\n01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,620\nthat's what I want.\n\n1555\n01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,490\nIf I already have one,\nI can specify the address right here,\n\n1556\n01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:15,670\nI don't need to click a link for that.\n\n1557\n01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,810\nI'm going say sign in\nwithout a Microsoft account.\n\n1558\n01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:23,620\nAnd then it's going to tell me how I\nreally shouldn't have done that, right?\n\n1559\n01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:26,220\nHow it would be so much more awesome\nif I had a Microsoft account, and\n\n1560\n01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:31,500\nhere's all the reasons why, but I'm gonna\nuse a local account, they can't stop me.\n\n1561\n01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:36,710\n>> Well one thing with a Microsoft\naccount, you will need a Microsoft\n\n1562\n01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:40,360\naccount to download apps\nfrom the app store.\n\n1563\n01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,290\n>> From the Windows store.\n\n1564\n01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:44,750\n>> Yeah, from the Windows store,\nthank you.\n\n1565\n01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:45,750\n>> It's all about terminology,\n\n1566\n01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:46,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1567\n01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:46,870\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1568\n01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:47,486\n>> So,\n\n1569\n01:17:47,486 --> 01:17:50,223\n>> From iTunes [LAUGH].\n\n1570\n01:17:50,223 --> 01:17:52,215\n>> But to get the full Windows 8\n\n1571\n01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:56,365\nexperience, then a Microsoft\naccount is the easiest way to\n\n1572\n01:17:56,365 --> 01:17:57,500\ngo.\n>> Yep.\n\n1573\n01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,370\nAll right, now it's asking me for\nmy name, which I do remember.\n\n1574\n01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:02,340\nAnd my password, if I want one.\n\n1575\n01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:03,830\nNow, we can leave it blank.\n\n1576\n01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,640\nIf you're the only person\nusing the machine,\n\n1577\n01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,320\nif it's a home machine,\nnon-sensitive data, whatever.\n\n1578\n01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,940\nOr you can punch in a password.\n\n1579\n01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:15,670\nIt does have some password requirements\nwhich are a little bit annoying like for\n\n1580\n01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:17,370\nexample, it requires a hint.\n\n1581\n01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,630\nI always hate that.\n\n1582\n01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:20,780\n>> I don't want to.\n\n1583\n01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,430\n>> I don't want to give a hint.\n\n1584\n01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:25,260\nBecause if somebody tries\nto break into my system,\n\n1585\n01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:28,320\ndo I want a hint to show up on the screen\nwhen they do it wrong the first time?\n\n1586\n01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,590\nIt's the most ridiculous thing but\nI'll punch one in anyway.\n\n1587\n01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:35,850\nAnd for the password, I just used\nthe word password, all lowercase.\n\n1588\n01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,680\nNothing too exciting there.\n\n1589\n01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,660\nBut when that's done, here we are.\n\n1590\n01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:40,990\nWindows 8.\n\n1591\n01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:43,250\nSo it's going to boot up now.\n\n1592\n01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,220\nIt's getting my user profile ready and\nthis does take a second.\n\n1593\n01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:49,460\nAnd so during this time, it's gonna\nshow me some little banners here and\n\n1594\n01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:53,320\njust gimme some information on how\nto use my touchscreen if I have one.\n\n1595\n01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,720\nSo it'll say things like how you\ncan move your mouse to a corner or\n\n1596\n01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,100\ndrag your finger in,\nswipe from the side, and so on.\n\n1597\n01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,610\nIn fact, it's probably detected\nthat I don't have a touchscreen so\n\n1598\n01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:04,470\nit's just gonna show the mouse ones.\n\n1599\n01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:08,360\n>> That virtual box doesn't\ntake your touchscreen?\n\n1600\n01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,810\n>> Well, I think it just shows\nup as a mouse to the VM.\n\n1601\n01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,700\nBut I guess we'll see,\nit hasn't set any swipe stuff yet.\n\n1602\n01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,530\nI would assume that it doesn't work.\n\n1603\n01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:18,590\n>> Hey, there we go!\n\n1604\n01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:22,380\n>> So like that, I just did the swipe in,\nbut that's on my actual desktop.\n\n1605\n01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:25,500\nSo yeah, virtual box is not passing it in.\n\n1606\n01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,560\nBut with that done.\n\n1607\n01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,530\nHere we are.\n\n1608\n01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:28,710\nHere's Windows 8.\n\n1609\n01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:29,780\nIt's now booted up.\n\n1610\n01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,530\nI'm in it.\n\n1611\n01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:31,870\nI'm up and running.\n\n1612\n01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:35,110\nIt's picked an awesome\nflower background for me.\n\n1613\n01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:38,990\nWhich is exactly what I wanted, right?\n\n1614\n01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:43,227\nNothing says hello like daisies,\ndaffodils, what are these things?\n\n1615\n01:19:43,227 --> 01:19:43,762\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1616\n01:19:43,762 --> 01:19:45,470\n>> [LAUGH] Anyhow.\n\n1617\n01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:48,410\nSo getting Windows 8 installed,\nreally not a big deal.\n\n1618\n01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:50,010\nReally, pretty straight forward.\n\n1619\n01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:51,130\n>> Yup, real straight forward.\n\n1620\n01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:55,960\nNot a whole lot of user interaction,\nanswered a couple of questions and\n\n1621\n01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:56,660\nthen here we go.\n\n1622\n01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:01,470\nAnd not long after,\nwe have a default install of Windows 8.\n\n1623\n01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:03,660\nWindows 8 Enterprise.\n\n1624\n01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,680\n>> I did Enterprise, yep.\n\n1625\n01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:09,790\nBut honestly, if this were Home or\nPro, it looks exactly the same, right.\n\n1626\n01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:11,570\nMaybe it doesn't pick\nthe flower background, right,\n\n1627\n01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:15,470\nthere's like ten that it picks from,\nbut it would pick some background.\n\n1628\n01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:20,680\nAs far as the visual appearance\n>> Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro,\n\n1629\n01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:24,995\nWindows 8 Enterprise, they do all\nlook the same at this stage at least.\n\n1630\n01:20:24,995 --> 01:20:27,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1631\n01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,792\n>> Yeah.\nNow, at the beginning of the show, Nate,\n\n1632\n01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:30,450\nyou had started,\nnot at the beginning of the show, but\n\n1633\n01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,777\nat the beginning of last segment,\nyou started talking about boot from VHD.\n\n1634\n01:20:32,777 --> 01:20:33,326\n>> Yes.\n\n1635\n01:20:33,326 --> 01:20:34,829\n>> And it's an awesome feature.\n\n1636\n01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:36,292\nI use it every single day.\n\n1637\n01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:39,746\nAnd so I wanted to show everybody\na basic install like this.\n\n1638\n01:20:39,746 --> 01:20:42,460\nJust so you could see a typical install.\n\n1639\n01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,070\nNow let's show them the good stuff.\n\n1640\n01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:46,440\nLet's show them what you\nwere talking about, Nate.\n\n1641\n01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,740\n>> All right Sam, sounds good.\n\n1642\n01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:51,130\nWell the first thing we need to\ndo to be able to boot from a VHD\n\n1643\n01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:55,408\nis to have a VHD to install to and\nto boot from.\n\n1644\n01:20:55,408 --> 01:20:56,455\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1645\n01:20:56,455 --> 01:20:59,508\n>> All right, so that's a great one, Don.\n\n1646\n01:20:59,508 --> 01:21:05,540\n>> All right, so to create a VHD,\nthere's a few ways to go about it, right?\n\n1647\n01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:06,340\nWhich way do you do it, Nate?\n\n1648\n01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:11,894\nDo you do it from the command line or\ndo you do it from the Disk Manager?\n\n1649\n01:21:11,894 --> 01:21:13,635\nOkay, all right, let's go that way.\n\n1650\n01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:15,259\nHang on let me.\n\n1651\n01:21:15,259 --> 01:21:21,420\n>> So you hit your Windows key+X and\nDisk Management.\n\n1652\n01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,060\n>> The only thing is I don't know\nif that's gonna be my virtual\n\n1653\n01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,930\nmachine's disk management or\nmy desktop's disk management.\n\n1654\n01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:28,240\nI guess we'll find out.\n\n1655\n01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,740\nSo in my virtual machine,\nI created a 64-gig hard drive, right?\n\n1656\n01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,440\nSo, it should be pretty easy to spot.\n\n1657\n01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,810\nIn my actual desktop,\nI have a 256-gig hard drive, so we'll see.\n\n1658\n01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:39,840\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n1659\n01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,364\nOh yeah, it's the virtual machine one.\n\n1660\n01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:42,443\nWe're good, all right.\n\n1661\n01:21:42,443 --> 01:21:43,221\n>> All right.\n\n1662\n01:21:43,221 --> 01:21:48,549\nAnd, then, well, yeah, when things\nwhen it finishes loading up its stuff,\n\n1663\n01:21:48,549 --> 01:21:53,830\nthe action bar or the little action\ntab up there, that's where we go to.\n\n1664\n01:21:53,830 --> 01:22:00,600\nThere's an option in there to create\na VHD which is what we wanna do.\n\n1665\n01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:07,480\nMinimum hard drive size 20 gigabytes so,\nwe, yeah, pick a place to save it.\n\n1666\n01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,770\nWe'll wanna create\na 20-gigabyte hard drive.\n\n1667\n01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:15,373\nWell I guess you can go more,\nbut for a minimum, right?\n\n1668\n01:22:15,373 --> 01:22:20,250\n>> Yeah, I'm gonna make a new folder here,\nwhich I'll just call VHD.\n\n1669\n01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:23,770\nAnd maybe this would be our work computer.\n\n1670\n01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:26,570\nSo I'll just call it WorkComputer.vhd.\n\n1671\n01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:29,960\nYou can call it whatever you want,\nthat's just what I'm gonna call it.\n\n1672\n01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:31,750\nAnd what size do you want me to go with?\n\n1673\n01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,130\n>> Let's just do 20 gigabytes.\n\n1674\n01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:35,590\nJust for us.\n\n1675\n01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:40,090\n>> Let's go a little bigger, cuz 20\ngigs is the actual requirement, right?\n\n1676\n01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,030\nAnd so I don't wanna skirt it that close.\n\n1677\n01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:43,980\nWe can do, let's do 36 gigs.\n\n1678\n01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,130\n>> Well, Nate, how big should it be?\n\n1679\n01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:45,906\nWell okay, cool.\n\n1680\n01:22:45,906 --> 01:22:46,859\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I didn't like your answer.\n\n1681\n01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:47,755\nYour answer so.\n\n1682\n01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:52,217\n>> So [LAUGH] all right,\nso now it's asking me,\n\n1683\n01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:55,116\ndo I want to do a VHD or a VHDX?\n\n1684\n01:22:55,116 --> 01:23:00,259\n>> Yep, VHD is a little bit\nmore compatible with other,\n\n1685\n01:23:00,259 --> 01:23:04,080\nother virtualization stuff.\n\n1686\n01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:11,440\nVHDX does other things, I'm not sure\nexactly what makes it stand out, Don.\n\n1687\n01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:16,340\n>> So the big difference is the old\nstandard, the VHD, had a maximum size of 2\n\n1688\n01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:20,550\nterabytes, which is more than big\nenough for most applications.\n\n1689\n01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:22,600\nBut in some server environments,\n\n1690\n01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:27,064\nyou might need a bigger one, and\na VHDX can go up to 64 terabytes, right?\n\n1691\n01:23:27,064 --> 01:23:29,012\nBut it really does just come down to size,\nright?\n\n1692\n01:23:29,012 --> 01:23:31,750\nA VHDX can be much, much bigger.\n\n1693\n01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,130\nA VHD can be smaller.\n\n1694\n01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:37,560\nIn my case of doing a 36-gig hard drive,\nit doesn't really matter which one I pick.\n\n1695\n01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,875\nSo, we'll just go with the standard VHD.\n\n1696\n01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:44,690\n>> Mm-hm, yep, now with those,\nwith that VHD, we can do a fixed size or\n\n1697\n01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,110\na dynamically expanding size, right?\n\n1698\n01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:51,850\nFixed size, it will allocate that\nwhole 36 gigabytes at once, and\n\n1699\n01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,320\nsection that off to use for\nthis virtual machine.\n\n1700\n01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,880\nDynamically expanding,\nit will just take what it needs.\n\n1701\n01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,500\nAnd as you install applications or\n\n1702\n01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:05,216\nwrite stuff to this hard drive, it will\nslowly start taking more and more space.\n\n1703\n01:24:05,216 --> 01:24:08,910\nSo I think, yeah,\n\n1704\n01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:13,980\nfixed size has a little bit more\nperformance, since it already has it.\n\n1705\n01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:16,870\nI think for our case,\ndynamically expanding would be fine.\n\n1706\n01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:21,290\n>> Yeah, my rule of thumb is if\nyou're gonna be using it for\n\n1707\n01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:26,290\nproduction like actual work, fixed size\nis gonna get you better performance.\n\n1708\n01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:29,362\nBut if you're using it for practice,\nif you're just experimenting,\n\n1709\n01:24:29,362 --> 01:24:32,179\nyou're doing labs,\ndynamically expanding is more efficient,\n\n1710\n01:24:32,179 --> 01:24:33,937\na little bit slower but more efficient.\n\n1711\n01:24:33,937 --> 01:24:38,279\nSo we're just doing practice, so\nI'll do dynamically expanding.\n\n1712\n01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:43,830\n>> All right, there we go.\n\n1713\n01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:47,940\nThere's our drive, so now that we\nhave our drive here, all right,\n\n1714\n01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:50,320\nwe need to initialize it.\n\n1715\n01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,609\n>> Okay.\n>> To bring it up.\n\n1716\n01:24:51,609 --> 01:24:56,555\nOn the disk 1, we'll right-click that and\nwe'll choose Initialize Disk, right,\n\n1717\n01:24:56,555 --> 01:24:58,191\nto bring that puppy online.\n\n1718\n01:24:58,191 --> 01:25:00,120\nWe get this little menu.\n\n1719\n01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:04,540\nSo, we got master boot record and\nthe GUID partition table.\n\n1720\n01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:09,820\nFor us right now GPT, MBR should be fine.\n\n1721\n01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:13,325\nThat will work for our little thing.\n\n1722\n01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:15,368\nAll right, there we go.\n\n1723\n01:25:15,368 --> 01:25:19,781\nNow what we need to do is create a part,\nwell, we can do it through here or\n\n1724\n01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:24,890\nwe could do command line stuff with\ndisk parts to give it a partition.\n\n1725\n01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:29,200\n>> Let's do the command lines,\ndo they show up on the exam?\n\n1726\n01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,720\n>> There's a lotta command\nline stuff on there.\n\n1727\n01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,311\nI mean-\n>> So, and\n\n1728\n01:25:34,311 --> 01:25:37,570\nthis is true with any Microsoft product,\nright?\n\n1729\n01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:39,450\nAnything you can do in\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n1730\n01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:41,100\nyou can do from the command line also.\n\n1731\n01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,610\nAnd on the exam you can see either, or.\n\n1732\n01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:46,684\nIn the GUI, a lotta the stuff you\ncan stumble through pretty easily,\n\n1733\n01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:48,910\nfrom the command line it's\na lot more difficult.\n\n1734\n01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,980\nSo let's do the command line so\nthat they can see that.\n\n1735\n01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,810\nAnd you guys can write\nthe commands down or whatever.\n\n1736\n01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:56,805\nSo in your studies you'll see them.\n\n1737\n01:25:56,805 --> 01:25:58,080\nNow that we are familiar with them.\n\n1738\n01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,156\nJust know that we could do this from\nthe GUI, it would be a lot easier.\n\n1739\n01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:04,313\nBut the exam's not necessarily about easy.\n\n1740\n01:26:04,313 --> 01:26:07,951\n>> All right, let's open up\nan administrative command prompt,\n\n1741\n01:26:07,951 --> 01:26:09,399\nwhich you already knew.\n\n1742\n01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:12,359\n>> Yeah, I'm gonna crank my font up so\nwe can actually read it.\n\n1743\n01:26:12,359 --> 01:26:18,000\n[LAUGH] It's kind of, kind of small\nthe way it is, that might be too big.\n\n1744\n01:26:24,156 --> 01:26:25,860\nThere we go.\n\n1745\n01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:29,430\n>> All right,\nfirst things first, this part.\n\n1746\n01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:31,940\nThis part will let us do that stuff.\n\n1747\n01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:33,860\nType in this part.\n\n1748\n01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,130\nSmash, Enter.\n\n1749\n01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:38,942\nBrings up this little diskpart thing, and\nso now we can run the diskpart commands.\n\n1750\n01:26:38,942 --> 01:26:42,360\nNow, what we need to do\nfirst is type in list\n\n1751\n01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:46,462\ndisk to get a list of our disks, right?\n\n1752\n01:26:46,462 --> 01:26:48,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so the 36-gigabyte,\n\n1753\n01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,320\nthat's the one that we want,\nthe one we just created.\n\n1754\n01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:55,390\nWe'll select disk 1, all right?\n\n1755\n01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:58,356\nNow let's do a list partition, right,\n\n1756\n01:26:58,356 --> 01:27:02,031\nbecause we need to select\na partition to write to.\n\n1757\n01:27:02,031 --> 01:27:04,770\nAll right, well, okay,\nlet's create a partition.\n\n1758\n01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:07,830\nSo create partition primary.\n\n1759\n01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:10,058\nWe wanna create and primary partition.\n\n1760\n01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,518\n>> Like that?\n\n1761\n01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:12,059\n>> Yep.\n\n1762\n01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:18,070\nAnd does that just, I don't actually know,\ndoes it take the whole drive?\n\n1763\n01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:20,585\nThat thing's a 36-gig partition?\n\n1764\n01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:24,930\n>> There's other switches and things\nwhere we can section off little bits, and\n\n1765\n01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:29,690\nthese are, yeah, just straight up options,\njust to get through it.\n\n1766\n01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:32,828\n>> And if you do it from VHD, you're\ntypically just gonna want one partition\n\n1767\n01:27:32,828 --> 01:27:34,680\nanyway, so this is pretty standard.\n\n1768\n01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:39,400\n>> All right, okay, now that we have this,\nnow we wanna list partition again.\n\n1769\n01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:42,650\nCuz we need to select it\nto be able to work with it.\n\n1770\n01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:44,950\nThere's that, all right.\n\n1771\n01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:48,480\nThe little asterisk there, it's already\nselected but we'll run it again.\n\n1772\n01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,240\n>> Oh, is it?\n\n1773\n01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:49,900\n>> Yeah, it's a little thing.\n\n1774\n01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:50,900\n>> All right, well, sweet.\n\n1775\n01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,930\n>> Now that we have a partition\nwe need to give it a file system.\n\n1776\n01:27:54,930 --> 01:28:00,530\nOkay, so let's type in format quick fs,\n\n1777\n01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:04,370\nfor our file system =ntfs.\n\n1778\n01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,710\nYep.\n\n1779\n01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:10,566\nShould take just a minute on the SSD,\nthat's nice.\n\n1780\n01:28:10,566 --> 01:28:12,515\nAll right, so now that we have,\n\n1781\n01:28:12,515 --> 01:28:15,489\nnow we have that we need\nto give it a drive letter.\n\n1782\n01:28:15,489 --> 01:28:18,155\nSo just type in assign.\n\n1783\n01:28:18,155 --> 01:28:22,060\nAnd there's other switches where\nyou can give it specific numbers or\n\n1784\n01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,025\nspecific letters.\n\n1785\n01:28:23,025 --> 01:28:24,500\nBut this is all just real basic.\n\n1786\n01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,680\nYou can see the top there,\nnow that Windows can see it.\n\n1787\n01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:31,164\nAnd it should appear in our Disk\nManagement, if we can just take a look.\n\n1788\n01:28:31,164 --> 01:28:32,026\n>> Oops.\n>> Over there.\n\n1789\n01:28:32,026 --> 01:28:33,328\nAnd yep, so it's blue.\n\n1790\n01:28:33,328 --> 01:28:33,936\nIt's writeable.\n\n1791\n01:28:33,936 --> 01:28:41,047\nNow, a VHD is It'll look like just a file\non a hard drive, one little thing.\n\n1792\n01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:47,030\nLet's jump into File Explore and\nlet's just take a look at that.\n\n1793\n01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:55,260\n>> I parked that on the C drive in\nthe VHD folder and there it is.\n\n1794\n01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:58,785\nAnd it is a blazing 106 megabytes in size.\n\n1795\n01:28:58,785 --> 01:29:01,730\n>> [LAUGH] Nice, so yeah, and\nthere's that dynamically expanding, so\n\n1796\n01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:05,780\nit's only taking just enough that\nit needs, which isn't very much.\n\n1797\n01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,540\n>> Because right now,\nwe've formatted it but\n\n1798\n01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,650\nwe haven't actually copied\nany real files to it yet.\n\n1799\n01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,160\n>> So we've got our disk now,\nwe can write to it.\n\n1800\n01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:19,770\nSo let's get a ISO mounted, so we're\ngonna do Enterprise, I believe, just.\n\n1801\n01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:23,650\n>> And I should still have it in\nthe drive from the install, right?\n\n1802\n01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:24,860\nSo what is that?\n\n1803\n01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,360\nMy D drive?\n\n1804\n01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,480\nYep, got it right here.\n\n1805\n01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,740\nWe just installed Windows\n8 before the break, so\n\n1806\n01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,420\nI've still got that disk in my drive.\n\n1807\n01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,230\nJust using that same disk we\ninstalled Windows 8 from.\n\n1808\n01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:40,430\n>> So we've got our ISO there mounted.\n\n1809\n01:29:40,430 --> 01:29:45,030\nNow it's time to apply it to our VHD.\n\n1810\n01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:51,148\nSo let's get back into our C drive.\n\n1811\n01:29:51,148 --> 01:29:53,230\n>> Okay.\n\n1812\n01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:55,960\n>> Now the tool that we're\ngoing to use to apply or\n\n1813\n01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:00,040\njust to work with with\nimages is the DISM command.\n\n1814\n01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:06,770\nDISM does a lot of stuff, we're just going\nto use one little small part of DISM.\n\n1815\n01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:14,190\nSo let's type in DISM\nbackslash apply hyphen.\n\n1816\n01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:16,490\n>> Backslash or forward slash?\n\n1817\n01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:17,280\n>> Forward slash, I'm sorry.\n\n1818\n01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:17,780\n>> All right.\n\n1819\n01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:20,000\nApply hyphen.\n\n1820\n01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,500\n>> Image.\n\n1821\n01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,170\nSo you want to apply an image.\n\n1822\n01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:26,060\nAll right?\n\n1823\n01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:27,120\n>> Okay.\n>> Now we need to tell it\n\n1824\n01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,090\nwhere the image is.\n\n1825\n01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:34,260\nAll right so, forward slash imagefile.\n\n1826\n01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,800\n>> Hyphen file or just imagefile?\n\n1827\n01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,995\n>> Image yep, just like that.\n\n1828\n01:30:36,995 --> 01:30:39,970\nColon and then where is it at?\n\n1829\n01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:41,710\nSo it's on the D drive right?\n\n1830\n01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:49,080\nD\\sources\\install.wim.\n\n1831\n01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,260\nThat's where it is.\n\n1832\n01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,370\nNow we need to tell it\nwhere it's gonna go.\n\n1833\n01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:58,608\nSo then space, forward slash, and then\n\n1834\n01:30:58,608 --> 01:31:04,720\napply DIR, or apply directory,\n\n1835\n01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:09,020\ncolon, and the path where it's gonna go.\n\n1836\n01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:12,999\nAll right, so which is our VHD, all right?\n\n1837\n01:31:12,999 --> 01:31:14,136\nSo E, right?\n\n1838\n01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:17,220\n>> Let me verify before I screw this up.\n\n1839\n01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,954\nSo it is the E drive, yes.\n\n1840\n01:31:19,954 --> 01:31:27,320\n>> All right then, space,\nforward slash, index, colon, one.\n\n1841\n01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:30,257\nAll right,\nI think we're just gonna do this.\n\n1842\n01:31:30,257 --> 01:31:31,204\n>> The partition?\n\n1843\n01:31:31,204 --> 01:31:32,450\nPartition one?\n\n1844\n01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:34,790\n>> Yeah, we ran into it one time,\nsomething like that.\n\n1845\n01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:35,720\n>> Oh no, wait.\n\n1846\n01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:36,340\nI remember this.\n\n1847\n01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:39,200\nIt's been a while since I used DISM.\n\n1848\n01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:43,200\nYou can store more than one\nimage in a single WIM file.\n\n1849\n01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,310\nSo this is install.wim.\n\n1850\n01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:49,540\nWhen we say index one, that says use\nthe first image inside of that wim file.\n\n1851\n01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,930\nNow, I think there is only one\nimage in the default one, but\n\n1852\n01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:55,430\nyou can build your own, and\nit's pretty cool, because you could have\n\n1853\n01:31:55,430 --> 01:32:00,310\na plain copy of Windows 8 and a copy of\nWindows 8 with Office 2013 installed, and\n\n1854\n01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:03,590\nall these custom images\nall in one big WIM file.\n\n1855\n01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:07,820\nAnd you would say index, colon, and\nthe number of the actual image you wanted.\n\n1856\n01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:08,760\nWe're just saying the first one.\n\n1857\n01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,430\nThat's what that is.\n\n1858\n01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:10,930\n>> All right.\n\n1859\n01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:13,790\n>> That was a nice, short command line.\n\n1860\n01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:15,430\nEasy to remember, too, right?\n\n1861\n01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:17,335\n>> Well, yeah.\n\n1862\n01:32:17,335 --> 01:32:19,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not too bad because it's like,\n\n1863\n01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:22,090\nwhat do you want to do,\nyou want to apply the image, right?\n\n1864\n01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:22,990\nWhere is the image?\n\n1865\n01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:25,120\nWell, image, here you go.\n\n1866\n01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,100\nWhere do you want it to go to?\n\n1867\n01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:27,400\nWell, we want to go here.\n\n1868\n01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:31,360\nSo you know the syntax I guess,\n\n1869\n01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,490\nafter you've done it a couple of times,\nsyntax isn't too bad.\n\n1870\n01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:40,020\n>> Now, you guys might ask yourself, you\nknow, I said earlier that you can do this\n\n1871\n01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:42,140\nstuff from the GUI and it's easier so\nwhy aren't we doing it?\n\n1872\n01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:46,640\nWell on the exam, the DISM command,\nDISM can show up.\n\n1873\n01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,030\nCan and often time does.\n\n1874\n01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:52,310\nIt can show up on the 7687 exam.\n\n1875\n01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:54,740\nIt does show up on the 7688 also.\n\n1876\n01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:58,480\nIn fact it's probably more likely\non that one, wouldn't you say Nate?\n\n1877\n01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,180\nBut it is important\n>> And so the more you're exposed to it,\n\n1878\n01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:02,300\nthe better off you are.\n\n1879\n01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:05,050\nMost of us are not running this\ncommand every single day, or\n\n1880\n01:33:05,050 --> 01:33:08,640\neven once a week or once a month.\n\n1881\n01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:11,000\nBut you know, it is out there,\nwe do need to know it.\n\n1882\n01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,970\nIt is something you need to memorize.\n\n1883\n01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:14,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1884\n01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:16,650\n>> Now, it's churning along,\n>> Right?\n\n1885\n01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:20,570\nSo while we're waiting on it,\nwe made this VHD.\n\n1886\n01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:23,710\nIt's basically installing\nWindows to the VHD right now, so\n\n1887\n01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,300\nit's getting that installed.\n\n1888\n01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,930\nWhat's next?\nWhat's the next thing that we need to do?\n\n1889\n01:33:27,930 --> 01:33:33,430\n>> The next thing we do is after it's\ndone we need to add this VHD to our\n\n1890\n01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:38,790\nboot options or our boot entry thing and\nnow they're on there.\n\n1891\n01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:42,820\nSo then when we reboot this computer,\nthen we'll see that install up there,\n\n1892\n01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:46,610\nthen we can choose whether we\nwant to boot to this VHD or\n\n1893\n01:33:46,610 --> 01:33:50,610\nthen boot to our existing\nWindows 8 installation.\n\n1894\n01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:53,840\n>> Okay, and we probably can't\ndo that while it's installing.\n\n1895\n01:33:53,840 --> 01:34:00,300\nSo, while we're waiting on this, let me\nshow you guys something that's kinda neat.\n\n1896\n01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,540\nLet me get back to them here.\n\n1897\n01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:06,050\nI'm gonna just real quick spawn\nanother Windows 8 machine.\n\n1898\n01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:09,970\nBecause I want to show you\nguys something kind of cool\n\n1899\n01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:12,990\nthat I found out myself not too long ago.\n\n1900\n01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:21,056\nI'm just real quick zooming through\nhere to create a virtual machine.\n\n1901\n01:34:25,565 --> 01:34:32,684\nAnd basically in the GUI install, all\nright, so I'm firing up another Windows\n\n1902\n01:34:32,684 --> 01:34:37,691\n8 install here kinda like\nwhat we saw before the break.\n\n1903\n01:34:37,691 --> 01:34:41,260\nAnd I wanna show you guys something neat\nin the Disc Management screen in here.\n\n1904\n01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:46,490\nYou can actually build an install to\na VHD from the Graphical install too.\n\n1905\n01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:49,650\nIt's easier but it's not what\nyou're going to see on the exam.\n\n1906\n01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:53,400\nOn the exam, they want you to know\nthat DISM command and all that.\n\n1907\n01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,690\nBut in real life land,\nthis isn't an alternative.\n\n1908\n01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,690\nAnd since we're waiting on the other one,\nI figure why not jam it in here anyway.\n\n1909\n01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:03,470\nSo basically, when we start to do an\ninstall, and I'm not actually going to do\n\n1910\n01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:06,550\nthe install cuz you'll see my system\nstarting to respond a little slow because\n\n1911\n01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:09,540\nof all the disk IO being\ngenerated by that other install.\n\n1912\n01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:12,430\nBut I do wanna show you guys this.\n\n1913\n01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:16,210\nSo basically I'm gonna launch\nthe install just like we did before.\n\n1914\n01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:19,750\nBut Windows 8 includes some\nneat stuff that you can get to\n\n1915\n01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:24,210\nfrom the disc partitioning screen,\nwhenever I get there.\n\n1916\n01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:27,740\nRight now it's having to think really hard\nabout that end user license agreement.\n\n1917\n01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:28,890\nSo, here we go.\n\n1918\n01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:35,010\nAll right, so on this screen,\n\n1919\n01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:38,320\nthis is normally where we're installing\nstraight to a normal partition.\n\n1920\n01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:42,740\nBut if you go into drive options you'll\nsee where we've got a few different things\n\n1921\n01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:43,420\nthat we can do here.\n\n1922\n01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:45,160\nI'm gonna create a new partition.\n\n1923\n01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:48,370\nI'll just partition out the whole drive.\n\n1924\n01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:52,068\nAnd I will format it.\n\n1925\n01:35:52,068 --> 01:35:56,511\nAll right.\n\n1926\n01:35:56,511 --> 01:36:00,980\nAnd, you know what?\n\n1927\n01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:03,110\nHere I am talking about it and\nI don't see the option.\n\n1928\n01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:03,900\nShoot.\n\n1929\n01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:08,410\nThere is an option where you can\nactually tell it to create the VHD and,\n\n1930\n01:36:08,410 --> 01:36:10,634\nyou know, I might need to go back.\n\n1931\n01:36:18,008 --> 01:36:18,849\nWell, shoot.\n\n1932\n01:36:18,849 --> 01:36:19,994\nMaybe I'm a big fat liar.\n\n1933\n01:36:19,994 --> 01:36:21,972\nI know I've done it from in here,\n\n1934\n01:36:21,972 --> 01:36:25,999\nwhere I dropped to a command prompt\nthat was able to create the VHD and\n\n1935\n01:36:25,999 --> 01:36:30,824\nthen come back in here and select the VHD\nand I sure don't see that option in here.\n\n1936\n01:36:30,824 --> 01:36:32,720\n>> Hm.\n\n1937\n01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:35,934\n>> Well, maybe I'm just crazy then.\n\n1938\n01:36:38,813 --> 01:36:41,924\nNow I've gotta remember what I did,\nbecause I know I've done it, and\n\n1939\n01:36:41,924 --> 01:36:43,730\nI just can't remember what I did.\n\n1940\n01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:48,040\nBut it was easier because all you\nhad to was create the VHD, and\n\n1941\n01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,210\nthen you would pick it right from here,\nand\n\n1942\n01:36:50,210 --> 01:36:52,660\ninstall to it without having to\nuse the DISM command at all.\n\n1943\n01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:57,510\nSo it was almost like a more graphical\nuser interface for doing this,\n\n1944\n01:36:57,510 --> 01:37:01,550\nbut I'm just not seeing\nthe options to let me do that.\n\n1945\n01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:05,370\nAnd there's probably some crazy keyboard\nshortcut or something you have to use,\n\n1946\n01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:08,670\nin fact the more I think about it\nthe more I think that there was.\n\n1947\n01:37:08,670 --> 01:37:12,170\nOh well, but just keep in mind there\nare other ways to go about it but\n\n1948\n01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:15,710\nthe way that we're showing you in\nNate's explanation here is kinda\n\n1949\n01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:17,610\nthe way we want to know for the exam.\n\n1950\n01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:20,420\nWoops, if I can keep it on my screen.\n\n1951\n01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:22,838\nBecause it is the way that it shows up.\n\n1952\n01:37:22,838 --> 01:37:27,110\nSo, it's 74%, it's basically copying\nthat whole disk image over, so\n\n1953\n01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:29,790\nwe have to kinda wait for that to finish.\n\n1954\n01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:31,650\n>> You know, and\none thing going about this way,\n\n1955\n01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:36,660\nis it will allow us to\ninstall Windows to this VHD\n\n1956\n01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:39,774\nwithout having to shut down our computer\nif we're working on something else.\n\n1957\n01:37:39,774 --> 01:37:40,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1958\n01:37:40,810 --> 01:37:43,640\n>> We can just do it right here on the\nfly, and not if we have anything running\n\n1959\n01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:47,980\nin the background or something else,\nwe can just run it this way.\n\n1960\n01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:53,340\n>> Yeah, so I do this on my computer,\nthe computer I'm on right now.\n\n1961\n01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:55,380\nI have a VHD which is my studio machine,\n\n1962\n01:37:55,380 --> 01:38:00,170\nthe machine that I'm in now, and so when\nI'm here on a show, I boot from that VHD.\n\n1963\n01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:03,430\nAnd then after the show, I switch and\n\n1964\n01:38:03,430 --> 01:38:06,470\nI boot back to my regular hard drive where\nI have my full install of Windows 8.\n\n1965\n01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:10,420\nAnd that's really handy because if\nyou watch some of earlier shows,\n\n1966\n01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:14,075\nyou might see where I'm sharing my\ndesktop and a Google hangout appears.\n\n1967\n01:38:14,075 --> 01:38:16,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or new email notifications keep popping\n\n1968\n01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,310\nup which drives me nuts.\n\n1969\n01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:20,160\nSo I don't want to turn\nthose notifications off,\n\n1970\n01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,840\ncuz I want them after the show,\nI just don't want them during the show.\n\n1971\n01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:30,130\nSo I can boot to this VHD where\nI don't have Java installed.\n\n1972\n01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:34,120\nOn my regular install, Java annoys the\nhell out of me cu it's constantly popping\n\n1973\n01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,380\nup about updating, and here on my\nstudio machine I don't want that.\n\n1974\n01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:41,430\nSo it allows me to have effectively\ntwo different personalities for\n\n1975\n01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:44,710\nmy computer without any\ncrazy special hardware.\n\n1976\n01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:48,440\nThis isn't true virtualization,\nso I don't need 64 bit,\n\n1977\n01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:51,510\nI don't need Intel VTX or AMD V.\n\n1978\n01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:55,195\nIt's all just a part of Windows\ndoing what Windows does.\n\n1979\n01:38:55,195 --> 01:38:57,226\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1980\n01:38:57,226 --> 01:39:01,370\n>> So, and I really want to do a Google\nsearch and find out what that option is.\n\n1981\n01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:06,050\nCuz I know for a fact that I've created\na VHD during the graphical installer, and\n\n1982\n01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:08,340\ninstalled it that way,\nwhich is definitely easier.\n\n1983\n01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:11,180\n>> Well then perhaps\nwhen we start the second\n\n1984\n01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:16,990\nepisode then we'll expect an answer to\nthese shenanigans that you're telling us.\n\n1985\n01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:17,660\n>> That's right.\n\n1986\n01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,912\n>> These phantom options.\n\n1987\n01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:21,860\n>> Yeah, or\nI can post it on the site too, for\n\n1988\n01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:26,150\nmost of you that are watching the video on\nITPro.tv, can always throw it on there.\n\n1989\n01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:28,270\nBut I know I have done it,\nso I'll have to find it.\n\n1990\n01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:30,240\n>> Hm.\n>> But we're almost there, 98%.\n\n1991\n01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,910\nSo just keep in mind, once this is done,\n\n1992\n01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:35,250\nthe last thing we need to do is\nto add this to our boot order.\n\n1993\n01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,560\nIf I finish this and just reboot,\n\n1994\n01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:40,880\nI'm only gonna see my regular desktop,\nI'm not gonna see this other option.\n\n1995\n01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,814\nWe've got to add the other option,\nwhich is what we'll do in 1%.\n\n1996\n01:39:44,814 --> 01:39:45,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1997\n01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:48,810\n>> Yeah, it looks like it's just almost\n\n1998\n01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:49,900\nhanging a little bit.\n\n1999\n01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,240\nIt went kinda fast, maybe it's\njust cuz now we're waiting on it.\n\n2000\n01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:56,000\n>> Yeah, now we're watching,\nit's like waiting for water to boil.\n\n2001\n01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,654\nIt's probably doing like CRCs,\nor checksums,\n\n2002\n01:39:58,654 --> 01:40:00,538\nsome kind of consistency checks.\n\n2003\n01:40:00,538 --> 01:40:01,977\n>> Mm-hm, CRCs.\n\n2004\n01:40:01,977 --> 01:40:06,062\n>> Yeah, exactly, CDCs, QVC.\n\n2005\n01:40:06,062 --> 01:40:08,770\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah, QVC.\n\n2006\n01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:10,541\n>> [LAUGH] There we go, it is done.\n\n2007\n01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:11,094\n>> All right.\n\n2008\n01:40:11,094 --> 01:40:12,260\n>> All right, what now?\n\n2009\n01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:15,675\n>> Okay, now what we need to do\nis add it to our boot entry.\n\n2010\n01:40:15,675 --> 01:40:16,794\nSo you know what?\n\n2011\n01:40:16,794 --> 01:40:20,240\nSo type in bcdedit enter, right?\n\n2012\n01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,510\nSo we're gonna get a list of what we have.\n\n2013\n01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:25,910\nSo we have our current partition, right?\n\n2014\n01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:29,410\nAnd then above that we've got our boot\nmanager, and that's all we've got right?\n\n2015\n01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:36,420\nSweet, so let's add it up there, so\ntype in BCDboot, space, and where's it at?\n\n2016\n01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:39,270\nSo the VHD is where?\n\n2017\n01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:43,005\n>> I'm gonna have to put quotes on this,\naren't I?\n\n2018\n01:40:43,005 --> 01:40:48,291\n>> Well actually here,\ntry this, backspace all that.\n\n2019\n01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:49,517\nRight, sorry.\n\n2020\n01:40:49,517 --> 01:40:52,965\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> BCDboot, space, and\n\n2021\n01:40:52,965 --> 01:40:57,145\nwhat's the drive letter of the VHD?\n\n2022\n01:40:57,145 --> 01:40:58,590\n>> It's E right now.\n\n2023\n01:40:58,590 --> 01:41:02,841\n>> All right, so\nthen do E:/Windows, all right?\n\n2024\n01:41:02,841 --> 01:41:07,720\nSo that's where the thing\nis that we wanna boot.\n\n2025\n01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,520\n>> Now that's where it is right now.\n\n2026\n01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,290\nThat works after the reboot and stuff?\n\n2027\n01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,340\n>> Let's try, let's try it and see.\n\n2028\n01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:13,990\nAll right, Smash Center.\n\n2029\n01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:18,057\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, now let's run that BCDedit\n\n2030\n01:41:18,057 --> 01:41:22,280\ncommand again, and\nlet's check to make sure it was applied.\n\n2031\n01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,800\nSo there's the C before, oh look at that,\nwe've got an entry there, cool.\n\n2032\n01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:32,320\nAll right so, now let's do this,\nwell one last little thing,\n\n2033\n01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:37,900\nso now let's do BCDedit, or wait, or no?\n\n2034\n01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,310\n>> No, no, go ahead, I'm curious.\n\n2035\n01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:43,650\nSo, let me just show real quick, Nate.\n\n2036\n01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:50,440\nI have doubts and\nyou've done this so, I'm sure\n\n2037\n01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:58,090\nfor me it may not show,\nsince I'm actually in a VM right now.\n\n2038\n01:41:58,090 --> 01:42:00,340\nOh shoot, it's not.\n\n2039\n01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:04,428\nSo I thought you had to point to the VHD,\ncuz when it boots up there is no E drive,\n\n2040\n01:42:04,428 --> 01:42:04,985\nright?\n\n2041\n01:42:04,985 --> 01:42:08,490\nAnd then there's nothing here\nidentifying that it's a VHD, so\n\n2042\n01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:09,740\nthat's why I have doubt.\n\n2043\n01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:12,381\nBut it is added so we can give it a shot,\nso what do we do next?\n\n2044\n01:42:12,381 --> 01:42:17,350\nAll right, now sometimes if you have more\ninstalls of Windows 8 going this route,\n\n2045\n01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:18,800\nit names it all the same.\n\n2046\n01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,780\nSo when it's going to reboot,\n\n2047\n01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:22,580\nit's just gonna say Windows 8, and\nthen another one that says Windows 8.\n\n2048\n01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:24,895\nNow we can see in the boot list now,\n\n2049\n01:42:24,895 --> 01:42:27,036\nour new one is going to appear first,\nso let's.\n\n2050\n01:42:27,036 --> 01:42:28,507\n>> And it is just called Windows 8, yeah.\n\n2051\n01:42:28,507 --> 01:42:35,317\n>> Mm-hm, so let's name it, so\nBCDEdits > space > / set description,\n\n2052\n01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:41,165\nyou can put a space between\nset description, all right?\n\n2053\n01:42:41,165 --> 01:42:41,745\n>> Okay.\n\n2054\n01:42:41,745 --> 01:42:46,715\n>> And then space, a quote,\nand then just name it, right?\n\n2055\n01:42:46,715 --> 01:42:51,720\nSo VHD boot, whatever you want,\nyour favorite password.\n\n2056\n01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,321\nActually, you know what?\n\n2057\n01:42:53,321 --> 01:42:55,647\nI'll called it work computer, right?\n\n2058\n01:42:55,647 --> 01:42:59,610\nSo lets just call it that,\nwork computer, all right, like that?\n\n2059\n01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:00,110\n>> Yep.\n\n2060\n01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:04,833\n>> All right, and let's just see if it.\n\n2061\n01:43:04,833 --> 01:43:06,643\n>> Oh, actually you know what?\n\n2062\n01:43:06,643 --> 01:43:10,326\nSo that's gonna send the description for\nthe current one that we're on.\n\n2063\n01:43:10,326 --> 01:43:11,000\n>> That's right.\n\n2064\n01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:15,670\n>> So that's going, yeah,\nI wouldn't name it differently.\n\n2065\n01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:17,420\nSo, we could run that.\n\n2066\n01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:18,670\n>> It did, okay.\n\n2067\n01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:21,294\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n>> So, I need to put that back, so\n\n2068\n01:43:21,294 --> 01:43:26,530\nthat's gonna be Windows 8 was what\nthat one was called, and then we want.\n\n2069\n01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:33,720\n>> And so rename it,\nwe'll have to do that when we boot to it.\n\n2070\n01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,270\nSo we change it form there.\n\n2071\n01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:40,310\n>> Okay, or you can get really\nannoying with the ID for it, right?\n\n2072\n01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:46,210\nSo like every disk has an ID or something,\nor actually this one's the default,\n\n2073\n01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:50,100\nso it should be relatively\neasy to rename now, if we do.\n\n2074\n01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,380\n>> Squiggly line default, right?\n\n2075\n01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,176\n>> Shoot, what is the?\n\n2076\n01:44:05,082 --> 01:44:10,352\nYeah, so\nyou do like set default description,\n\n2077\n01:44:10,352 --> 01:44:14,450\noh, and then I picked the wrong one.\n\n2078\n01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:16,905\nIt'd probably be easier to do it your way.\n\n2079\n01:44:16,905 --> 01:44:18,899\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm always making\n\n2080\n01:44:18,899 --> 01:44:19,819\nthings more difficult for us.\n\n2081\n01:44:19,819 --> 01:44:21,058\n>> That's fine, that's fine, you know?\n\n2082\n01:44:21,058 --> 01:44:22,339\nWe're just along for the ride here.\n\n2083\n01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:26,275\n>> So, what I did is I said,\nbcdedit /Set and then I specify the GUID,\n\n2084\n01:44:26,275 --> 01:44:28,292\nthe identifier for that machine.\n\n2085\n01:44:28,292 --> 01:44:32,250\nNow fortunately it was set as the default,\nso I can just type default.\n\n2086\n01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:37,710\nBecause the other GUIDs are things\nthat are these long strings like this.\n\n2087\n01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:40,990\nBut I just renamed it, so\nhere's that one that's on the E drive, and\n\n2088\n01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:44,180\nit's called Work Computer now, so\nit's renamed without rebooting.\n\n2089\n01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:45,070\n>> Sweet.\n>> All right.\n\n2090\n01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:46,600\nLet's restart this puppy.\n\n2091\n01:44:54,355 --> 01:44:56,606\n[LAUGH] Of course I've got to do\nthe command line reboot I'm at\n\n2092\n01:44:56,606 --> 01:44:58,020\nthe command line.\n\n2093\n01:44:58,020 --> 01:44:59,990\nAll right, so here it goes booting.\n\n2094\n01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:02,250\nI left the CD in the drive, but that's ok.\n\n2095\n01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:05,730\nSo it'll get past that, and then what?\n\n2096\n01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:06,250\n>> Mm hm.\n\n2097\n01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:10,970\n>> Then we get our windows logo,\nand then something happens.\n\n2098\n01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:12,340\nSo it's booting up right now.\n\n2099\n01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,550\nThis is the Windows boot loader.\n\n2100\n01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:17,125\nIf we had Bitlocker and all that stuff\ngoing, it's got to sort some of that out.\n\n2101\n01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:19,028\nHoly moly, it worked.\n\n2102\n01:45:19,028 --> 01:45:20,570\nSo.\n>> Holy moly it worked?\n\n2103\n01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:24,350\nWhat was that?\n\n2104\n01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:30,460\n>> I gotta say, Nate, I really thought\nthat it had that identified as a VHD.\n\n2105\n01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:31,320\nI was wrong, right?\n\n2106\n01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,980\nSo.\nWhen it was mapping that partition e:\\,\n\n2107\n01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:38,230\nI was thinking in my head, when it boots\nup there is no e:\\, how does it map that.\n\n2108\n01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:43,280\nApparently it is ok with that and\nMicrosoft, maybe they know a thing or two.\n\n2109\n01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,248\n>> So here we go we can choose which.\n\n2110\n01:45:47,248 --> 01:45:51,580\n>> And since, [INAUDIBLE] you wanna go to,\nbut we renamed it so now it's EZ.\n\n2111\n01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:52,340\nEasy to do.\n\n2112\n01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:53,430\nAnd, so.\n\n2113\n01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:57,340\n>> If I were to choose Windows 8, that's\nmy base install that we did before, and\n\n2114\n01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:01,230\nif I choose the VHD,\nnow it's gonna load Windows from\n\n2115\n01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,220\nthat virtual hard drive which we've\nnever logged into before, right?\n\n2116\n01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:08,370\nSo this should be like a first\ntime load or whatever.\n\n2117\n01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:08,930\n>> Yep.\n\n2118\n01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:12,287\nAnd with that command, so\nwe took that WIN file.\n\n2119\n01:46:12,287 --> 01:46:14,130\nAnd we just copied it over.\n\n2120\n01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:17,390\nAnd so now it's booting up for\nthe first time.\n\n2121\n01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:18,920\nIt's going to detect all of our stuff.\n\n2122\n01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:23,770\nAnd just like what we saw installing\nWindows the other way, we'll come into\n\n2123\n01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:29,220\nthe personalization and stuff, get into\nour Microsoft accounts and all that jazz.\n\n2124\n01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,860\n>> Extremely cool stuff.\n\n2125\n01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:34,380\nAnd like I said,\nit's something I use every single day.\n\n2126\n01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,140\nWell not every day,\non the weekends I don't use it so much.\n\n2127\n01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:38,980\nBut every day that I'm here\non the show I'm using it.\n\n2128\n01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:40,830\nAnd so it is a pretty cool one,\n\n2129\n01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:43,600\nespecially if you want to learn\nabout other operating systems.\n\n2130\n01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,530\nIf you want to run Windows server 2012,\nthis is actually running right on your\n\n2131\n01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:52,830\nhardware it's not requiring\nvirtualization software so you get true.\n\n2132\n01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:54,560\nBare metal performance.\n\n2133\n01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,310\nAs if you had installed it right\nthere on the hardware itself.\n\n2134\n01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:58,850\nSo, very, very cool.\n\n2135\n01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:00,300\n>> Yep.\n\n2136\n01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:04,870\nSo, I think that covers it for\ninstalling Windows 8.\n\n2137\n01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:09,730\nSo, we saw the going in the traditional\nway of rebooting your computer,\n\n2138\n01:47:09,730 --> 01:47:11,750\ninstalling off the DVD.\n\n2139\n01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:15,330\nWe've seen well DVD I guess you\ncould also do a flash drive and\n\n2140\n01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:16,340\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n2141\n01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:17,100\n>> Yeah yeah USBT.\n\n2142\n01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:20,840\n>> And yeah so using the ism command to\n\n2143\n01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:26,530\napply the image you know to the VHD and\nyeah so.\n\n2144\n01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:27,800\nSetting stuff up.\n\n2145\n01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:32,580\nI think that covers installing Windows\n8 for what we're gonna cover today.\n\n2146\n01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:35,250\n>> Now,\nall we did was get Windows installed, and\n\n2147\n01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,860\nthen we haven't really done much with it,\nright.\n\n2148\n01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:41,720\nSo in our next episode, we're gonna jump\nin there and actually tackle Some of\n\n2149\n01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,520\nthe things that are involved with getting\nWindows configured the way that we want.\n\n2150\n01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,040\nRight?\n\n2151\n01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,210\nNot just the default.\n\n2152\n01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:49,715\nSo I don't want the flower background.\n\n2153\n01:47:49,715 --> 01:47:51,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I need to change it.\n\n2154\n01:47:51,530 --> 01:47:53,410\nSo we're gonna talk about\nsome of that stuff.\n\n2155\n01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:58,460\nAnd not just, the fancy, you know how do\nyou change your wallpaper stuff, right?\n\n2156\n01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:00,980\nMicrosoft wants us to know\na heck of a lot more but\n\n2157\n01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:05,490\nthis is kind of the foundation\nthe 70 dash 687 exam.\n\n2158\n01:48:05,490 --> 01:48:07,760\nGetting it installed.\n\n2159\n01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,490\nSome of the key points that we\nwanna remember for the exam,\n\n2160\n01:48:10,490 --> 01:48:16,050\nthe different editions of Windows,\n64-bit versus 32-bit,\n\n2161\n01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:19,550\nthe DISM command that we saw, right?\n\n2162\n01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:22,975\nThese are all key components that\nare very likely to show up on the exam.\n\n2163\n01:48:22,975 --> 01:48:28,550\n>> Mm-hm, yep, and the different editions\nand what you get with that edition.\n\n2164\n01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:35,440\nIt could be something like you're\nplace wants to use Bitlocker.\n\n2165\n01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:36,200\nWhat do you need to do?\n\n2166\n01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,660\nWell you need to have\nat least Windows 8 Pro.\n\n2167\n01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:41,720\nSo knowing some of those additions could.\n\n2168\n01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:43,050\n>> Yeah, could come up.\n\n2169\n01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,180\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2170\n01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:45,760\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, as always,\n\n2171\n01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:49,200\nwe hope you enjoyed the show and\nsigning up for IT pro TV.\n\n2172\n01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:55,765\nI am Don Pazette, Nathan Copeland,\nand we'll catch you next\n\n2173\n01:48:55,765 --> 01:49:02,730\ntime around\n\n",

try to move through some\nof the new objectives that have been\n\n4\n00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,540\nadded in the Windows 8.1 Exam Update for\nthe 70-687 exam.\n\n5\n00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,210\nI know it's tough.\n\n6\n00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,080\nA lot of us have been studying for\none exam and\n\n7\n00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,760\nthen they add some new stuff to it.\n\n8\n00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,570\nSo, so we're trying to make it easier for\n\n9\n00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,770\nthose of you that are just\ntacking on that knowledge and\n\n10\n00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,050\nwe're filming special one offs like\nthis one, to cover those objectives.\n\n11\n00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,450\nSo, we're going to be focusing in on\nobjectives, let's see, 1.1.5, and 1.1.6.\n\n12\n00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,940\nRolls right off the tongue.\n\n13\n00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,660\nWhich adds in some new things that really.\n\n14\n00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,230\nThey should have been in\nthe original exam but weren't.\n\n15\n00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> So we're gonna take a look at them\n\n16\n00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,530\ntoday and kind of see what we\nneed to know about them, right.\n\n17\n00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And the first\n\n18\n00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:57,210\nnew objective that was added with the 8.1\nupdate was good old Windows RT, right.\n\n19\n00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,370\n>> So so Windows RT is a new\nversion of Windows 8 and\n\n21\n00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,440\nit is, it's sweeping the nation.\n\n22\n00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,190\n>> That's right.\n>> Right, Ronnie?\n\n23\n00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,270\nIt's what we're all moving toward.\n\n24\n00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,650\n>> Everybody loves it so\n\n25\n00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,315\nmuch that it's appearing\n>> We don't know where right now.\n\n26\n00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No Windows RT,\n\n27\n00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920\neven though we,\nwe know it is Windows 8 in the background,\n\n28\n00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,230\nthey swear it's not Windows 8,\nit's a special edition of, of Windows, but\n\n29\n00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,260\nit's really designed for\nthe arm-based processor here, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,880\nAnd so, those are normally the ones\nthat you tend to find in terms of\n\n31\n00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,860\nprocessors on things like, smartphones\nyou know, the one with the what is it?\n\n32\n00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,175\n9000 megapixel's phone.\n\n33\n00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:32,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n34\n00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,670\n>> That you actually have and\nalso on the, on the windows tablets.\n\n35\n00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,390\nThe surface is where\nyou tend to have that.\n\n36\n00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,480\nNow in, in that thicker op,\noperating system the weird thing is this.\n\n37\n00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,865\nYou can't go and, and\nlike buy a copy of whatever.\n\n38\n00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:51,400\n[LAUGH] You name it.\n\n39\n00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,840\n>> Yeah, you know, for the for\nthe traditional versions of Windows, X86.\n\n40\n00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,360\n>> Yeah.\n\n41\n00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,780\n>> 32 bit and 64 bit, [CROSSTALK] we're\nreally talking about ones that are built\n\n42\n00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,928\non the Intel architecture for 386.\n\n43\n00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:04,770\nAnd the AMD 64 architecture for 64 bit.\n\n44\n00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,885\nYou can go and\nyou can buy computer parts off the shelf.\n\n46\n00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:09,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can buy a copy of the operating\n\n47\n00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,200\nsystem and install it and go, all right.\n\n48\n00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,890\nAnd that's because the Intel\ni386 architecture and\n\n49\n00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,280\nthe AMD 64 architecture,\nthey're standardized.\n\n50\n00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,740\n>> Huh.\n>> They're stabilized.\n\n51\n00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,470\nAnd if people build hardware for\nthem they have to conf-\n\n52\n00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,040\nConform to the design specs of\nthe AMD64 architecture, right?\n\n53\n00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,850\n>> Yeah.\n\n54\n00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,762\n>> But that's not how ARM works, right?\n\n55\n00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:30,420\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n56\n00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,000\n>> ARM, they created specs for\n\n57\n00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,170\na low power processor, right?\n\n58\n00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:35,965\nCuz power is a.\n\n59\n00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:37,995\nThey can serve in mobile devices.\n\n60\n00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:40,985\n>> Yeah.\n>> But they didn't define\n\n61\n00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:44,525\nthe way the hardware is allowed\nto interact with that processor.\n\n62\n00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:47,075\nSo the hardware vendors get\nmuch more involved in this.\n\n63\n00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:52,375\nAnd by hardware vendors I mean the, you\nknow, RAM manufacturers, hard drive and\n\n64\n00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:56,895\nsolid state memory, network cards,\nright, cellular modems.\n\n65\n00:02:56,895 --> 00:03:00,529\nYou've got GSM antennas and\nLTE antennas and all that stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:01,320\n>> Yeah.\n\n67\n00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,430\nYou know, all those manufacturers, when\nthey build out their hardware, they then\n\n68\n00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,050\nwrite a custom interface to allow that\nhardware to talk to the arm processor.\n\n69\n00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> And vice versa.\n\n70\n00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,550\nSo, every vendor is-\n>> Different.\n\n71\n00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,170\n>> Different.\n\n72\n00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,850\nIt's just not.\n\n73\n00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,220\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's not world built around\n\n74\n00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,970\ncompatibility.\n\n75\n00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n76\n00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,660\nAnd, and even on the hardware side, as\nmuch as that's true, we can't go out and\n\n77\n00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,195\nbuy like, a Ghost, or\nwhatever the, the different games.\n\n78\n00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And just load them on there,\n\n79\n00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,580\nbecause they don't tend to run.\n\n80\n00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,740\nYou hate to say it, even essentially,\n\n81\n00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,685\nthey're limited to what,\nWindows Store apps, a lot of times.\n\n82\n00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:35,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or\n\n83\n00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,695\na special edition of Office that you\ncan only get through the Windows Store.\n\n84\n00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:39,680\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n85\n00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,540\nYou know, if you, if you buy Windows RT-\n>> Yeah.\n\n86\n00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,650\n>> And then, and, what we're trying to do\nis make sure that you guys understand the,\n\n87\n00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,590\nthe limitations and\n\n88\n00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,440\nthe differences, right-\n>> Yeah.\n\n89\n00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,940\n>> We're not-\n>> Nope, no.\n\n90\n00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,320\n>> Trying to paint it out as being a bad\nOS, although I think it's worthless and\n\n91\n00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,230\nshouldn't be there-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,079\n>> But, but, not,\n\n93\n00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,110\nnot trying to paint it that way, but,\nbut basically if you buy Windows RT.\n\n94\n00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> It is a specially compiled version of\n\n95\n00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,900\nWindows to run on top of an ARM processor\nfor a specific set of hardware, right?\n\n96\n00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,250\nNot a general set of\nhardware like we're used to.\n\n97\n00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,000\nSo if you go out and you buy a Dell Venue\ntablet that's running Windows RT, well,\n\n98\n00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,950\nDell had to work with Microsoft to create\nthe hardware drivers to tie it all\n\n99\n00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,420\ntogether and\nget it working on that Dell system.\n\n100\n00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,010\nNot, you know, a generic install like,\nlike we have with traditional Windows.\n\n101\n00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,660\nSo, that means that it\nruns perfectly fine.\n\n102\n00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,610\nRight?\nBut it means that you can't just go and\n\n103\n00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,040\nbuy Windows RT off the shelf.\n\n104\n00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,310\nYou can't go and install it yourself.\n\n105\n00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,000\nYou've gotta get it through a vendor.\n\n106\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,300\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it's almost always\n\n107\n00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,530\nwith a hardware purchase.\n\n108\n00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,970\n>> That's right. Nah. >> I don't\nthink you can buy it as a standalone.\n\n109\n00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,310\nAnd that's a good thing and\na bad thing, right.\n\n110\n00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,590\nOn a good side, you are absolutely\nguaranteed full compatibility.\n\n111\n00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,080\n>> That's right.\n>> With the hardware you purchase, right,\n\n112\n00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,420\nbecause the vendor had to design it in.\n\n113\n00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n114\n00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,160\n>> On a negative side\n>> Arm devices like this,\n\n115\n00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,110\nbecause of the hardware\ninteractions are rarely\n\n116\n00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,910\nupgradeable-\n>> Yeah.\n\n117\n00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,602\n>> Right.\nMaybe you have some expandable memory,\n\n118\n00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:54,932\nbut that's about it, [CROSSTALK] right.\n\n119\n00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:57,890\nSo, so expansion is,\nis not something that's, that's very big.\n\n120\n00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,220\n>> Yeah.\n>> No, I was gonna say in, in that sense,\n\n121\n00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,630\nlike we said,\neven though Windows themselves are saying,\n\n122\n00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,840\nthis is not truly Windows 8 it looks like,\nwhen there's a, exactly.\n\n123\n00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,280\nSo, so don't get fooled by that,\nbut on the exam,\n\n124\n00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,855\nthey call it out, it really isn't.\n\n125\n00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:13,150\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n126\n00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,780\nI had a chance to use a Surface Tablet for\na little while, that was a Surface RT\n\n127\n00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,570\ntablet, and you know, if you fire it up\nnext to a full Windows 8, and, and now,\n\n128\n00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,610\nyou know, I say Windows 8, but\nI mean Windows 8.1, right.\n\n129\n00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,060\nThat when you fire them up side by side,\nthey look identical.\n\n130\n00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, you've got your,\n\n131\n00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,700\nyour start screen,\nyou can open up a command prompt, you can,\n\n132\n00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,445\nyou know, fire up notepad,\nthey look identical.\n\n133\n00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:35,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n134\n00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,860\n>> The Office RT,\n\n135\n00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,530\nor the Windows RT side comes with Office-\n>> Yeah.\n\n136\n00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,830\n>> On it, you know, Microsoft Office.\n\n137\n00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,735\nSo it's nice to have.\n\n138\n00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:43,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because Microsoft Office is not cheap.\n\n139\n00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,040\n>> No.\n>> Whereas,\n\n140\n00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,830\nif you buy the standard Windows,\nyou gotta go and buy Office on top of it.\n\n141\n00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,690\n>> Right.\n\n142\n00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,500\n>> But after that, the third party\napps are just like Ronnie said.\n\n143\n00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,770\n>> Yeah.\n>> You're really limited to what's in\n\n144\n00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,870\nthe Windows\n>> Store.\n\n145\n00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,130\nNow, you, you say limited,\nthere's a ton of apps in the store,\n\n146\n00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,530\nyou can pick whichever ones you want.\n\n147\n00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,730\nBut you can't just go and download the\ntraditional apps that you've run before.\n\n148\n00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,920\nThey have to be recompiled to\nsupport the ARM processor.\n\n149\n00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,820\nYep.\nAll right, so\n\n150\n00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,220\nthat's, that's a pretty big difference and\nMicrosoft early on said they were going to\n\n151\n00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,940\nmake a big push to ensure consumers\ndidn't use the two products.\n\n152\n00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,450\n>> Right.\n>> But even they've admitted\n\n153\n00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,850\nthey didn't do a good job of that.\n\n154\n00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it is very easy to confuse them.\n\n155\n00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,970\nLooking at the desktop.\n\n156\n00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,510\n>> Yeah, you can't tell.\n\n157\n00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,470\n>> They look identical.\n\n158\n00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> You really have to go into your\n\n159\n00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,120\nsystem Control Panel to see oh,\nthis is Windows RT.\n\n160\n00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,220\nOr, you know, try and\nrun an x86 executable and, and\n\n161\n00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,310\nwatch it say this is\nan invalid executable.\n\n162\n00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,840\nSo either way.\n\n163\n00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,850\nBut so some of the pros of Windows RT,\nvery power efficient, you know.\n\n164\n00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,540\nOn my laptop, I, I'm running the,\nthe full version of Windows, and with,\n\n165\n00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,845\nwith Windows 8.1 Pro on my laptop I\nget maybe four hours of battery life.\n\n166\n00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:47,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But on most surface tablets I\n\n167\n00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,800\nmessed with, I was getting like\nseven to eight hours, right?\n\n168\n00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,680\n>> Wow.\n>> So it almost doubled\n\n169\n00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,760\nthe battery life on it.\n\n170\n00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,470\nThey also have really,\nreally high end arm processors.\n\n171\n00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,590\nSo they're, they're Speedy you know\nthey're quick, we don't have to worry so\n\n172\n00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,200\nmuch about viruses on them right\nnow cause there is not a lot of arm\n\n173\n00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,670\nviruses out there.\n\n174\n00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,780\nBut it's just like the mac world\neventually the viruses catch up.\n\n175\n00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,540\n>> Right.\n>> So you know there's a lot of pros,\n\n176\n00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,520\nthere's a lot of benefits to windows rt.\n\n177\n00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,460\nBut the biggest drawback is getting\nto be the lack of backwards\n\n178\n00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,960\ncompatibility with the apps.\n\n179\n00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,570\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> That you probably use in your\n\n180\n00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,330\nbusiness currently.\n\n181\n00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,350\nSo that's really hurt\nthe adoption rate of Windows RT.\n\n182\n00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,490\n>> Hm.\n\n183\n00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,755\n>> So, not to mention the fact\nthat Microsoft now has three OSs.\n\n184\n00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:26,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, they've got\n\n185\n00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,980\n>> Windows on the, on the desktop and\n\n186\n00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,100\nserver platforms, right?\n\n187\n00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,320\n>> Right.\n>> Which are X 86 and A M D 64.\n\n188\n00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,440\nAnd then you got Windows RT and\nyou've got the Windows Mobile.\n\n189\n00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,990\n>> That's true,, yeah.\n\n190\n00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,010\n>> Right?\nAnd so,you know,\n\n191\n00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,720\nthere's three different platforms.\n\n192\n00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,700\nAnd it's,\nit's kind of becoming tough to support.\n\n193\n00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,200\n>> Mhm.\n\n194\n00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:44,838\nAll right.\nSo so yeah that's kind of\n\n195\n00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:48,239\nthe thing to remember, just on the exam,\nyou can't install Windows RT yourself,\n\n196\n00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:51,688\neven if you buy a Windows RT device, it'll\nusually have a recovery partition on it,\n\n197\n00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:54,918\nbut they don't come with disks or\nanything to, to redo the install yourself.\n\n198\n00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,292\nYou know that and, and if you want it,\nyou gotta get it from the venders.\n\n199\n00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:01,775\nSo you can't just go to Microsoft and\nbuy a disk, or whatever, so\n\n200\n00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,842\nit is very customized, very tailored for\n\n201\n00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:06,835\nthe hardware, designed to be mobile and\npower efficient.\n\n202\n00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n203\n00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,090\n>> Alright.\n\n204\n00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,670\nSo Ronnie can you think of anything\nelse we need to throw out on Windows RT?\n\n205\n00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,810\n>> No, I, I think that covers\nis sufficiently for us.\n\n206\n00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,530\nAlright.\n\n207\n00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,500\nThe the second part of this new\nobjective that they added in is\n\n208\n00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,325\ndetermining the hardware requirements for\nsome of the bells and whistles.\n\n209\n00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:24,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you go onto the Windows 8.1 website,\n\n210\n00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,040\nit is,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n211\n00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,940\n>> It is full of all\n\n212\n00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,910\nthe great new features that are available.\n\n213\n00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,900\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah, letting you guys know,\n\n214\n00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,410\nthis is what we\n>> We added that this is what we're\n\n215\n00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,370\ndoing better in Windows 8.1 and\nlet me tell you,\n\n216\n00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,400\nsome of the features-\n>> Yeah.\n\n217\n00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,270\n>> Are really cool, right?\n\n218\n00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,090\nBut a lot of these features are dependent\nupon the hardware in your system.\n\n219\n00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,270\nAnd so we need to be aware of that.\n\n220\n00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,700\nThat just because Windows\n8.1 has a feature in it\n\n221\n00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,980\ndoesn't mean that your hardware\nnecessarily supports it.\n\n222\n00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,610\n>> Yeah.\nSo built-in to Windows 8.1,\n\n223\n00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,620\njust like it was in Windows 8 is high,\nClient Hyper-V okay for\n\n224\n00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,733\nus and, and as excited as,\nas I am about it.\n\n225\n00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I love it, most users that are just\n\n226\n00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,790\nhome user are probably gonna say,\nwhat the heck do I ever need that for?\n\n227\n00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,820\nBut for us here, it allows us to\ninstall multiple operating systems,\n\n228\n00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,310\neven while running Windows 8.1, but it\ndoes actually require a bit of hardware,\n\n229\n00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,050\nyou know, to, to actually make it happen.\n\n230\n00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,870\n>> You know, I remember,\nRodney, three years ago.\n\n231\n00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> You and\n\n232\n00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,060\nI bought laptops\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n233\n00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,560\n>> Within, within.\n\n234\n00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,440\n>> Yeah, months.\n>> Weeks, or, or whatever of each other.\n\n235\n00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,190\nAnd and.\n\n236\n00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,440\n>> Yep.\n>> Different laptops.\n\n237\n00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,080\nYou went with an HP,\nI went with with a Lenovo, right?\n\n238\n00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,150\nAnd and so we had these laptops.\n\n239\n00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,880\nAnd it, they were both pretty high end.\n\n240\n00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,270\n>> They were. Yeah. >> I think yours\nwas a little higher end than mine was.\n\n241\n00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,055\nBut because I'm, I'm a bit of a tightwad.\n\n242\n00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But but anyhow,\n\n243\n00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,990\nthey were great laptops at the time.\n\n244\n00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,940\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, we,\n\n245\n00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,490\nwe were running Windows 7,\noriginally, right.\n\n246\n00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,330\n>> Right.\n>> But then we upgraded to Windows 8 and,\n\n247\n00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,510\nand stuff, and so\nthat was running really well,\n\n248\n00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,110\nwhen, you know-\n>> Yeah.\n\n249\n00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,380\n>> Hyper V was gaining popularity.\n\n250\n00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> But if you wanted to run Hyper V on\n\n251\n00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,980\nyour laptop,\nthen you had to run Server 2008, right.\n\n252\n00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,240\n>> Right.\n>> So, so you had to go to a server OS.\n\n253\n00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,150\nWhen they announced client side Hyper V,\nI was excited.\n\n254\n00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,490\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> It was like finally,\n\n255\n00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,720\nI can run Windows 8.\n\n256\n00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,440\n>> Yeah.\n\n257\n00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,250\n>> And have Hyper V.\n\n258\n00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,580\nYou know, that, that's awesome.\n\n259\n00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,505\nI, I really want that.\n\n260\n00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:03,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n261\n00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,730\n>> And so when, when Windows 8\nwas released, I installed it.\n\n262\n00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,609\nWent to add Hyper V.\n\n263\n00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:08,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think you were saying Don,\n\n264\n00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,640\nyou gotta check it out.\n\n265\n00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hyper V is running great.\n\n266\n00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,960\nAnd I couldn't add it online and\ni was like what, you know.\n\n267\n00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,460\nI had virtualization support\nmy processor had Intel VTX so\n\n268\n00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,060\nI had virtual technology\nbuilt in to my processor.\n\n269\n00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,380\nI couldn't run hyper view.\n\n270\n00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,710\n>> Ya and that's because\nthere's a hardware requirement.\n\n271\n00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,930\nThat we call SLAT, second level address\ntranslation, which, fortunately,\n\n272\n00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,825\nmy laptop did.\n\n273\n00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:33,310\n[LAUGH] But, yeah, it was one of those\nfrustrating things where we would\n\n274\n00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,475\ncompare and then it's like, no his\ncheck mark was not there to turn on,\n\n275\n00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:37,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n276\n00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,070\n>> Client\n>> And mine was there.\n\n277\n00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,240\nBut it's that second little address\ntranslation that really makes a difference\n\n278\n00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,870\nhere to make it fully support the,\nthe things that it actually needs to.\n\n279\n00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n280\n00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,900\nAnd, you know, the, the funny part was,\n\n281\n00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,550\nif you installed Windows server 2012-\n>> Yeah.\n\n282\n00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,080\nYou could run hyperview without slack,\nright?\n\n283\n00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,370\nSo second of all under translation, it's\ndesigned to accelerate the performance of,\n\n284\n00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,910\nof the little virtual video card\n>> Right.\n\n285\n00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,500\n>> To give you a snappier response.\n\n286\n00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,000\nAnd on a server-\n>> Yeah.\n\n287\n00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,290\n>> We're not really worried\nabout the video response, right?\n\n288\n00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,200\nAnd who cares?\n\n289\n00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,030\nBut on a client,\nyou might be watching a YouTube video or\n\n290\n00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,640\nsomething like that from within the VM,\nsomething you wouldn't do on a server.\n\n291\n00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,120\n>> Right.\n>> And you need that snappier response, so\n\n292\n00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,250\nMicrosoft made it a requirement.\n\n293\n00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> They said if you're gonna do Hyper-V\n\n294\n00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,810\non a Windows 8 client, you gotta have\nthis second level address translation\n\n295\n00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,545\nin order to get the experience\nthat they wanted to create.\n\n296\n00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:24,370\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n297\n00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,390\nThe other requirement for us, of course,\n\n298\n00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,770\nis if you're gonna have Hyper-V,\nit's gonna have be the x64.\n\n299\n00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,950\nOr the 64 bit processor for us, and what,\nat least four gigs of RAM, I believe.\n\n300\n00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,930\n>> Yeah, you know, on,\n\n301\n00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,810\non the official side-\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n302\n00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,210\n>> Let, let me, let me bring this\nup cause it, it is a little weird.\n\n303\n00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n304\n00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,910\n>> So here, I, I've got the official\nsystem requirements for\n\n305\n00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,420\nWindows 8.1, and as you look in here,\nit'll say like, RAM,\n\n306\n00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,175\nyou need at least one gig, or\nif you're going 64 bit, two gigs.\n\n307\n00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n308\n00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,300\nAnd then down here somewhere we\ncan find where Hyper-V is listed.\n\n309\n00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,140\nRight here.\n\n310\n00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,448\nIf you wanna run client-side Hyper-V.\n\n311\n00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,700\nLet's just make this a little bigger.\n\n312\n00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,290\nIt requires a 64-bit system with\nsecond level address translation.\n\n313\n00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,570\nAnd an additional two gigs of RAM.\n\n314\n00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,910\nWindows 8.1 Pro only, so\nit's not included in the standard.\n\n315\n00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,755\nNow it says 2 gigs of additional RAM.\n\n316\n00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:13,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that can get confusing.\n\n317\n00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,320\n>> Right.\n>> A lot of people say,\n\n318\n00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,510\nwell it just needs two.\n\n319\n00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,380\nBut it's two gigs of additional RAM.\n\n320\n00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,880\nIn addition to the two\ngigs you already need.\n\n321\n00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,430\n>> Right.\n\n322\n00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,420\n>> For the 64 gig for the 64 bit base.\n\n323\n00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,715\nSo it is four gigs total.\n\n324\n00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:26,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n325\n00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n326\n00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,290\nThe only other weird requirement that,\nthat I also found on this an,\n\n327\n00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,340\nwhich is kind of neat, is that they're\ntryin to make this client Hyper-V as,\n\n328\n00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,680\nas smooth as it can to transition\ninto an enterprise as well.\n\n329\n00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,990\nSo you can even connect\nup your client Hyper V,\n\n330\n00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,000\neven with SAM storage stuff, and that's\namazing, because this now means that you\n\n331\n00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,390\ncan actually move your own virtual\nmachines to the, the actual network,\n\n332\n00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,575\nwithout actually turning it off is\nwhat they're actually saying here.\n\n333\n00:12:54,575 --> 00:12:57,825\nSo they've really tried to integrate\nthis in with the enterprise fairly well.\n\n334\n00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,705\n>> Ya and you know for\ntesting and practicing and stuff,\n\n335\n00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:01,745\nit's an awesome environment.\n\n336\n00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:05,390\nFor you guys at home, if your\nlooking to learn more about servers.\n\n337\n00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,690\nYou can go to Microsoft's website and\ndownload a, eval copy of Server,\n\n338\n00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,830\nthat will run for\nlike six months or something.\n\n339\n00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,710\nYou can install it in Hyper-V so\nyou still have Windows 8 on your desktop,\n\n340\n00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,580\nyou can still use it like your normal PC,\nwhen your not studying, but\n\n341\n00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,950\nwhen you are studying you can fire\nup that Windows Server 24 machine.\n\n342\n00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> It, it's a great resource.\n\n343\n00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,400\n>> It's nice.\n\n344\n00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,260\nNow you might ask yourself,\n\n345\n00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,790\nhow do I know if my system supports\nsecond level address translation, right?\n\n346\n00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> How do I know if I have SLAT support?\n\n347\n00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,820\nAnd, and there's a few ways to do it.\n\n348\n00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,020\nThe, the best way is to rely on\nthe vendor of your processor.\n\n349\n00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,010\n>> Right.\n>> So they'll, they'll tell you.\n\n350\n00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,140\nBut there are some third party\nprograms that can do it.\n\n351\n00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,990\nLet me,\nlet me just show you here on my computer.\n\n352\n00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,880\nSo if I wanted to find\nFind out if I had SLAT.\n\n353\n00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,760\nThe easiest way for me is, I go into\nthe system control panel icon, and,\n\n354\n00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,470\nand I just do the search these days.\n\n355\n00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,030\nSo I'll fire up the system, and\nthat tells me my processor right there.\n\n356\n00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,530\nSo I've got an I7-3667 U, okay?\n\n357\n00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:02,368\nSo then I can go and\ndo a Google search for a you know,\n\n358\n00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,489\nIntel I7-3667 U.\n\n359\n00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,000\nAnd one of the first links that comes up\nwill be the Intel Architecture site just,\n\n360\n00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,155\nyou know, look for that ARK that's Intel's\nbasically like their, their database.\n\n361\n00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:15,770\n>> Uh-hm.\n\n362\n00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,880\n>> And when yo click on that, it will give\nus all the data about that processor, and\n\n363\n00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,140\nso we can look and see like this processor\nlaunched second quarter of 2012, I didn't\n\n364\n00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,328\nrealize my processor as outdated, but\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:14:26,328 --> 00:14:27,954\n>> You can see I've got two cores and\n\n366\n00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:31,843\nfour threads, and, and so on, and as you\nread down, it'll start to say some of\n\n367\n00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:35,154\nthe additional features that this\nprocessor has, and some of the,\n\n368\n00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:39,440\nI don't necessarily care too much about,\nlike maximum memory size and stuff.\n\n369\n00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,400\nBut as we go down, somewhere in here we'll\nfind where we have virtualization support,\n\n370\n00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,320\nand they'll list it, and\nit should be right around here, so So\n\n371\n00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,210\nhere I can see\nIntel Virtualization Technology VT-x.\n\n372\n00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,180\nThat is a base requirement for Hyper-V.\n\n373\n00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,480\n>> Right.\n>> Even the older versions of Hyper-V\n\n374\n00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,410\nyou had to have VT-x and\nthen, oh, that's right.\n\n375\n00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,530\nSecond Level Address Translation or SLAT.\n\n376\n00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,140\n>> No.\n>> Intel doesn't call it SLAT.\n\n377\n00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,545\n>> No.\n>> Cuz that would be too easy [LAUGH] for\n\n378\n00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:04,740\neverybody to use the same name.\n\n379\n00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,020\nIntel calls it extended page tables,\nor EPT.\n\n380\n00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,370\nAnd so that's it right there.\n\n381\n00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,130\nIntel VTX with extended page tables.\n\n382\n00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,190\nAnd and you can, you know,\n\n383\n00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,640\nclick this little magnifying glass here\nto get some additional information.\n\n384\n00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,140\nOr, no, it's searching for\nother processors.\n\n385\n00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,430\nWell, somewhere on here you can click and\noh, you actually click on the name and\n\n386\n00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,270\nit'll give you the additional information\n>> And in here, somewhere.\n\n387\n00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,380\n>> Yep, there it is.\n>> It should mention.\n\n388\n00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,220\nYeah, here.\n\n389\n00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,290\nAlso known as\nSecond Level Address Translation.\n\n390\n00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,430\nCan I make that bigger?\n\n391\n00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,991\n>> Oh yes, you can.\n\n392\n00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:34,934\n[LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n393\n00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,030\nAll right, so, so\nthey're letting me know, you know,\n\n394\n00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,400\nIntel VT-x with Extended Page Page Tables,\nalso known as SLAT,\n\n395\n00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,860\nprovides acceleration for\nmemory intensive virtualized applications.\n\n396\n00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,370\nBlah, blah, blah.\n\n397\n00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:44,990\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n398\n00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,630\n>> So, you've gotta make sure that\nyour processor supports that.\n\n399\n00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,960\nIt's not just an Intel thing.\n\n400\n00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,107\nSo if you have an AMD processor,\n\n401\n00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:51,389\nsome of them- [CROSSTALK]\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n402\n00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:51,990\n>> Support it too.\n\n403\n00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,360\nAnd I think most of theirs do now.\n\n404\n00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,359\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you know, Intel's, I mean,\n\n405\n00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:58,958\nAMD's been a little more aggressive about\nsupporting virtualization technologies.\n\n406\n00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,042\nSo you know, so you'll,\nyou'll see it there.\n\n407\n00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,708\nBut you gotta have the hardware support.\n\n408\n00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,341\nIt's not something you can upgrade,\nyou can't add the support to your CPU.\n\n409\n00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,230\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> You know, especially in a laptop.\n\n410\n00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,799\nIn a desktop you might be able to replace\nyour CPU with one that has the features,\n\n411\n00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,320\nbut but\nit's not something you normally upgrade.\n\n412\n00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,200\nAnother way you can do it is there's\napplications out there like CPUZ.\n\n413\n00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,430\nCPUZ is a pretty popular one that\nit's just a freeware little program.\n\n414\n00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,785\nYou can tell it's freeware,\ncuz their website is overrun with junk.\n\n415\n00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But but basically you run it and\n\n416\n00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,660\nit tells you all the different things\nthat you have built into that processor.\n\n417\n00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,390\nAnd so you can see that and, and there's\nseveral tabs here to get, you know,\n\n418\n00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,620\nadditional information.\n\n419\n00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,510\nSo it, it's another way you can find out\nabout your processor and, and whether or\n\n420\n00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,250\nnot you have that support.\n\n421\n00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,690\nAll right.\n\n422\n00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,170\nSo so those are a few different things,\nyou know, for the exam.\n\n423\n00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,290\nObviously they don't want you to\nuse these third party softwares,\n\n424\n00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,108\nso you'd use that system control panel\nto find out your processor information.\n\n425\n00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:53,388\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n426\n00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,244\nYeah.\n\n427\n00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:57,280\nOur next technology here\nthat we wanna talk about\n\n428\n00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,080\nis what we call Miracast display here for\nus.\n\n429\n00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,180\nAnd so this allows me to take\nsomething like a laptop here and\n\n430\n00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,460\nextend it on to, well, another device\nwithout any wires, pretty much, right?\n\n431\n00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:09,960\n>> Yeah-\n>> Yeah.\n\n432\n00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,034\n>> [LAUGH] You know, this is, this one of\n\n433\n00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,764\nthose technologies that, it sounds cool-\n>> Yeah.\n\n434\n00:17:12,764 --> 00:17:13,644\n>> But, I don't know anybody who's\n\n435\n00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:14,594\nactually used it.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:15,864\n>> You know, have you\n\n437\n00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:17,100\never had your laptop-\n>> Yeah.\n\n438\n00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,820\n>> And, you're, you're in your\nliving room, or whatever, and\n\n439\n00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,070\nyou got a nice big TV.\n\n440\n00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you want to show what's on your\n\n441\n00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,290\nlaptop on the TV.\n\n442\n00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,490\nWell, in the past, you could run a cable.\n\n443\n00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,500\nLike I think, I've got,\nwhat do I have on this thing?\n\n444\n00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,110\nDisplay board, right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n445\n00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,115\n>> So I could get a display\nport adapter to HDMI.\n\n446\n00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:33,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then, I could run HDMI to my TV and\n\n447\n00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,520\nthen, there we go.\n\n448\n00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,370\nBut then I've got my laptop sitting there\nwith a cable running across the living\n\n449\n00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,290\nroom to connect to this TV.\n\n450\n00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n451\n00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400\n>> Wouldn't it be nice if we\ncould do it wirelessly, right?\n\n452\n00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,495\nJust wirelessly have our display show up\non that TV, and that's what Miracast does.\n\n453\n00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:48,371\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now Miracast,\n\n454\n00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,564\nif you've never heard of it, Ronnie and\n\n455\n00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:54,172\nI [CROSSTALK] we both live in the south\nyour accent's worse than mine.\n\n456\n00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:57,427\n>> Yes.\n>> But it sounds like we are just\n\n457\n00:17:57,427 --> 00:18:03,370\nredneckifying mirrorcast,\nbut it is M-I-R-A, Miracast.\n\n458\n00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,010\nAnd then so, Miracast,\n\n459\n00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,930\nit's a technology that lets you take\nwhatever's on your display, throw it\n\n460\n00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:15,240\nwirelessly over to a little Miracast\nadapter that you connect to your TV.\n\n461\n00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,880\nOr maybe you have one of the few TVs\nthat has Miracast build into it.\n\n462\n00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,090\nSome Do.\n\n463\n00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,220\nOr so I hear.\n\n464\n00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,095\n>> I was trying to think of a Jeff\nFoxworthy play on that, I couldn't do it.\n\n465\n00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:25,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was trying.\n\n466\n00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,455\n>> You, you might be a redneck.\n\n467\n00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you run an HDMI cable from your\n\n468\n00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,800\nlaptop to your TV instead\nof using Miracast.\n\n469\n00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,340\n>> That's true.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n470\n00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,170\n>> That's true.\n\n471\n00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,060\n>> So, the big drawback with Miracast,\nright?\n\n472\n00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,430\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you don't use Miracast,\n\n473\n00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,610\nyou just run an HDMI cable.\n\n474\n00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,820\nSo you go and you buy a cable and\nthen you're done.\n\n475\n00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,680\nBut with Miracast, you've gotta have that\nMiracast adaptor attached to your TV,\n\n476\n00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,380\nor have a TV with it built-in.\n\n477\n00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n478\n00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,820\n>> Now I, I think I've mentioned before.\n\n479\n00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,101\nI'm a tight wad, so\nI know my TV doesn't have it built-in.\n\n480\n00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But but, you know,\n\n481\n00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,260\nyou might have a high end one that has it.\n\n482\n00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,750\nBut, if you're going to a conference some,\ncenter somewhere.\n\n483\n00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,250\nIf you're going to do a presentation\nin your office room or\n\n484\n00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,370\nsomething like that, you don't even\nknow what kind of TV's in there.\n\n485\n00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:02,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so\n\n486\n00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,420\nyou don't know what adapter to bring and\nso on.\n\n487\n00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,057\nAnd someti-, sometimes just going back to\nthat old cable, is, is a little better.\n\n488\n00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:08,610\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Yeah.\n\n489\n00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,050\n>> I mean I still carry\na VGA cable around with me,\n\n490\n00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,630\nbecause I know that, that, that's gonna\nbe supported pretty much everywhere I go.\n\n491\n00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,830\n>> I still have rabbit ears on my TV.\n\n492\n00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,913\nSo yeah, that works.\n\n493\n00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,986\nDoes Miracast work with [CROSSTALK].\n\n494\n00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:22,976\n[LAUGH]\n>> So so\n\n495\n00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:27,527\njust keep in mind what the hardware\nrequirement of Miracast, you know,\n\n496\n00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:31,950\non the PC side, there really isn't\nall that much that's required right?\n\n497\n00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,750\n>> Just your network adapter has to be\nable to support that WiDi, whatever.\n\n498\n00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,680\nYou know, the,\nthe ability to transmit that.\n\n499\n00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,410\nAnd support that.\n\n500\n00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,920\nYeah.\n>> You know, there is actually one little\n\n501\n00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,590\nnote they put in here that your display\nadapter has to support the WDDM.\n\n502\n00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,768\n>> That's it.\n>> The Windows Display Driver.\n\n503\n00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,660\nFor Model 1.3.\n\n504\n00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,790\nAnd if you've got a laptop that was\nmanufactured in the last three to four\n\n505\n00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,242\nyears, it's gonna do it.\n\n506\n00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,590\n>> Sure. [LAUGH] >> But\nyou know that is one requirement.\n\n507\n00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,550\nThat is a software requirement though, so\n\n508\n00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,125\nthat is something that can be\nfixed by a vendor after the fact.\n\n509\n00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,665\nAnd then your Wi-Fi adapter\nneeds to port Wi-Fi direct,\n\n510\n00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:05,025\nwhich pretty much all of them do.\n\n511\n00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,205\nSo the real hardware requirement\nhere is what's on the TV.\n\n512\n00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,515\n>> Right.\n>> You know you need that Miracast\n\n513\n00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:12,045\nadapter, and I don't even know,\nlet's see what those things run for.\n\n514\n00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,925\nI'm, I'm just curious.\n\n515\n00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:19,510\nWe'll see if old here we go.\n\n516\n00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,500\nSo you can get a Netgear Miracast\nadapter for $65 bucks.\n\n517\n00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,900\nYou know, so actually,\nit seems to be about the, the going rate.\n\n518\n00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,590\nRight around that $60 well not for\nPanasonic but for\n\n519\n00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,905\neverybody else about 60 bucks.\n\n520\n00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:30,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you know,\n\n521\n00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,450\nyou buy this adapter,\nit plugs into your TV and\n\n522\n00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,460\nyou're able to wirelessly transmit\nyour display over to that television.\n\n523\n00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,660\nAlright, what's next on our list?\n\n524\n00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,115\nWe They have pervasive device encryption.\n\n525\n00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:45,035\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it's a new term.\n\n526\n00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,785\nYeah, we\n>> Yeah.\n\n527\n00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:46,955\n>> We were joking around about it-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n528\n00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,275\n>> Before the show, because it,\n\n529\n00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:50,435\nit, it's not really describing one thing,\n\n530\n00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:51,645\nit's really describing-\n>> A lot.\n\n531\n00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:53,765\n>> A, a whole collection of things.\n\n532\n00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:56,605\n>> Yeah.\nThe whole idea behind the pervasive\n\n533\n00:20:56,605 --> 00:21:01,550\ndevice encryption is that they want to\nbring the stuff that really does make\n\n534\n00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:06,510\nlike BYOD devices really more secure for\nyour network for, for\n\n535\n00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,310\nyour business here into every aspect.\n\n536\n00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,390\nAnd into your desktops as well as\nyour laptops, and everything else.\n\n537\n00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,780\nSo what they've said is that they've taken\nlike the Windows phone drive encryption's\n\n538\n00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,930\nthat they've had and the stuff that\nyou would've on the tablets here\n\n539\n00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,940\nto automatically encrypt those things.\n\n540\n00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,020\nBut they still use some\n\n541\n00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,180\nof the technologies that we learned about\nin Windows 8 as well to help us do stuff.\n\n542\n00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,110\n>> Yeah, and, and in fact,\npervasive device encryption is really just\n\n543\n00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,970\nan umbrella term that's wrapping up\nseveral technologies we already had,\n\n544\n00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,340\nand then kind of changing\nthe default state, right.\n\n545\n00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,145\n[CROSSTALK] So here I've got a, a,\n\n546\n00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:40,456\nthis is one of the Windows 8 security\nimprovements announcements they did.\n\n547\n00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:43,878\nAnd I know it says Windows 8, but\nit is talking about Windows 8.1,\n\n548\n00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:48,171\nand and highlighting what's new, and\nthey basically break down pervasive device\n\n549\n00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:52,050\nencryption for us here, and nothing on\nhere should really be shocking for us.\n\n550\n00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> These should all be things\n\n551\n00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,890\nthat we've already seen.\n\n552\n00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,270\nEncrypted hard drive support.\n\n553\n00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,950\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we've had BitLocker since\n\n554\n00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,955\nWindows Vista.\n\n555\n00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:00,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, and, and so\n\n556\n00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,470\nit a part of Windows 8.1,\nit's built in and it's ready to rock.\n\n557\n00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,520\nAnd, and BitLocker's now supported\nacross the various editions.\n\n558\n00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,610\nAnd you'll see BitLocker\npre-provisioning and\n\n559\n00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,325\nthat's really the one\nthat's changed the most.\n\n560\n00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:12,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n561\n00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,260\n>> If you do a fresh and\n\n562\n00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,511\nclean install of Windows 8.1,\nBitLocker is enabled by default.\n\n563\n00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:20,290\n>> Yeah.\n>> It is encrypting your drive\n\n564\n00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,510\nby default from the very beginning.\n\n565\n00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,510\nIf you do an upgrade, this is,\nthis is what Ronnie and\n\n566\n00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,390\nI were really going on\nabout before the show.\n\n567\n00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,424\nI upgraded my laptop\nfrom Windows 8 to 8.1.\n\n568\n00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:31,811\nIf you do that,\nit does not encrypt automatically.\n\n569\n00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:32,393\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n570\n00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,960\n>> You have to encrypt it yourself.\n\n571\n00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,460\nBut it's the same thing, you just go and\nturn on BitLocker, and off you go and\n\n572\n00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,260\nit's the same requirements\non a hard drive.\n\n573\n00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,930\n>> Right.\n\n574\n00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,770\n>> You've gotta have a trusted platform\nmodule, a TPM, or you'll need to make\n\n575\n00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,790\nuse of USB key or some other medium,\nmedia, to be able to store that.\n\n576\n00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,295\nA medium.\nYou have to bring in a psychic.\n\n577\n00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:51,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n578\n00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,370\nthey'll be able to encrypt your laptop.\n\n579\n00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,920\nSo, you know, you have to have that\nStorage of a private key somewhere.\n\n580\n00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> And typically it's gonna be in your\n\n581\n00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,060\nTrusted Platform Module, or TPM.\n\n582\n00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,870\n>> Now that one, they say that\nengrypted hard drive support,\n\n583\n00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,580\nbut is looks like they're mentioning\nthat kinda special, hybrid,\n\n584\n00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,350\nweird drive that we had\ntalked about awhile ago.\n\n585\n00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,928\n>> Yeah, you know, those are, are really\ninteresting ha, have you ever used those?\n\n586\n00:23:12,928 --> 00:23:13,636\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n587\n00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:14,170\nHm.\nNever.\n\n588\n00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:14,833\nYeah.\n>> I,\n\n589\n00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,057\nI've had a chance to use just one and\nit was a Seagate drive an, and\n\n590\n00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:22,050\nthey manufacture these hard drives that\nactually have the encryption circuitry\n\n591\n00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,190\nright there on the drive itself.\n\n592\n00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,170\nNow, it's kind of an interesting\nthing about this,\n\n593\n00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,440\nis that when you have the TPM\nbuilt into the drive itself and\n\n594\n00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,180\nsomebody steals the drive,\nthey're stealing the TPM also.\n\n595\n00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,254\nBut that's okay because it's taking a\nfingerprint of your, your system's ID and\n\n596\n00:23:37,254 --> 00:23:39,650\nall that, so\nit won't work in other computers.\n\n597\n00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,230\nSo it gives you that\nnice solid protection.\n\n598\n00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,130\nIt's a good substitute if you\ndon't have a TPM in your system.\n\n599\n00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,880\n>> Alright.\n>> Then you can actually do hardware\n\n600\n00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,990\nencryption right there on the drive.\n\n601\n00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> And in Seagate,\n\n602\n00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,340\nWestern Digital they\nmake several of those.\n\n603\n00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,260\n>> Nice.\n>> Windows has\n\n604\n00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,830\nsupported them-\n>> Yep.\n\n605\n00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,350\n>> For a long time.\nThe, the one that I worked with was\n\n606\n00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,083\nactually under Windows 7-\n>> Nice.\n\n607\n00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,167\n>> So I haven't used Windows 8.\n\n608\n00:23:58,167 --> 00:23:59,917\nBut but even if you don't have that-\n>> Yeah.\n\n609\n00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:03,833\n>> You can use BitLocker you\nget the same Same thing.\n\n610\n00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:07,592\nI, I have heard people say\nthat that if you do the,\n\n611\n00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:12,120\nthe ones where it's built into\nthe drive you get slightly performance.\n\n612\n00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,740\n>> Hm.\n>> But\n\n613\n00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,010\nI haven't been able to test that myself.\n\n614\n00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, some of the other things that they\n\n615\n00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,905\nadded in 8.1 you know, some of the stuff\nlike used disk space only encryption.\n\n616\n00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:22,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n617\n00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,430\n>> You can encrypt your entire\ndrive including the unused space.\n\n618\n00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,930\nAnd, and that's if you want\nthe highest level security.\n\n619\n00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,360\nOr you can tell it just to encrypt the\ndrive where you're actually storing data.\n\n620\n00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,240\n>> Mm hm.\n>> If it was\n\n621\n00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,020\nenabled at the time of install,\nyou might as well do the whole thing.\n\n622\n00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,170\nBut if you are enabling it after the fact,\nyou can speed up enabling the, the.\n\n623\n00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,265\n>> BitLocker software,\nby just doing the used disk space.\n\n624\n00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:44,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Personally I always do the whole disk.\n\n625\n00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,340\nSome of the other things we have with\nBitLocker you have a, a pin number,\n\n626\n00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,330\nyou know, a password that you're basically\nusing to, to unlock the machine.\n\n627\n00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,180\nAnd in the past, you had to,\nto, well in a lot of cases it's\n\n628\n00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,340\ngenerally a help desk ticket, so\nyou had to deal with the help desk or,\n\n629\n00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,168\nor have higher level permissions\nto be able to change that.\n\n630\n00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:08,070\n>> In Windows 8.1 they're modified that so\nthat regular end users can chain,\n\n631\n00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,960\nchange their own pin which helps\nto reduce that support cost.\n\n632\n00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n633\n00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,520\nThe last one here talks about instead of\nhaving to type in that password every\n\n634\n00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,540\ntime, especially if you're going\ninto a business network, to just be,\n\n635\n00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,940\nby being connected to\nthat business network,\n\n636\n00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,870\nit allows that BitLocker to\nbecome unencrypted for you.\n\n637\n00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,930\nSo again ease, ease of functionality\nmore than anything else.\n\n638\n00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,190\nTake it off,\n>> Yeah.\n\n639\n00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,160\n>> And now I have an encrypted\ndrive once you shut it down.\n\n640\n00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,060\n>> This is probably my, my favorite\n>> Yeah.\n\n641\n00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,400\n>> Feature that was introduced because if\nyou have somebody with a desktop PC, and\n\n642\n00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,780\nit's here in the office.\n\n643\n00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,300\nDesktop PCs don't travel,\n>> Yeah.\n\n644\n00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,930\n>> Right?\n\n645\n00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,120\nSo you can set them up\nwith network unlock, and\n\n646\n00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,060\nthe end user never even knows-\n>> No one knows.\n\n647\n00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,370\n>> That BitLocker was there.\n\n648\n00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,290\nThey fire up the machine, they work,\neverything's there, and it's like normal.\n\n649\n00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,350\nBut if somebody steals the machine and\ntakes it offsite,\n\n650\n00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,520\nthe instant it leaves your network, it's\nnot plugged into your network anymore,\n\n651\n00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,970\nit won't find your domain controllers and\nso on.\n\n652\n00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n653\n00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,240\n>> It knows it's on a different\nnetwork and now it prompts for\n\n654\n00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,890\nthat pin number-\n>> Yeah.\n\n655\n00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,890\n>> Or password, right?\n\n656\n00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,350\nSo you're not inconveniencing your users\njust to be able to defeat a you know,\n\n657\n00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:06,955\na thief, or whatever.\n\n658\n00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:08,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n659\n00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,990\nSounds good.\n\n660\n00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,130\n>> All right, so the,\n\n661\n00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,462\nthe main running theme through all\nof that was that you need a TPM.\n\n662\n00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:14,323\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n663\n00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:18,130\nAnd on a laptop,\nalmost all laptops have TPMs these days.\n\n664\n00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,610\nOn desktops though it's not a guarantee.\n\n665\n00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,190\nAnd so as you spec out your\ndesktops going forward,\n\n666\n00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,850\nyou probably wanna pick\nones that do have a TPM.\n\n667\n00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n668\n00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,210\nAnd actually carrying on with that TPM,\nwe got one more and\n\n669\n00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,900\nwe got just a couple of minutes here.\n\n670\n00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,640\nA virtual smart card.\n\n671\n00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,920\nNow Mike and I have talked about this\nidea of the, the virtual smart card and\n\n672\n00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,800\nit's supposed to help us in\nterms of smart cards, right?\n\n673\n00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,340\nThat mutli-factor authentication.\n\n674\n00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n675\n00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,897\n>> But if it's virtual,\nthat means it's stored on the TPM itself.\n\n676\n00:26:43,897 --> 00:26:44,753\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n677\n00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:47,975\n>> And so the idea of actually having\nmulti-factor doesn't seem like it's really\n\n678\n00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:48,705\nthere, does it?\n\n679\n00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:50,380\n>> Well, so, you know,\nwith the smart card.\n\n680\n00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,785\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It, it's all about two\n\n681\n00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:53,345\nthings when you well, it is two things.\n\n682\n00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:53,899\n>> Two things.\n\n683\n00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:54,925\n[LAUGH]\n>> When you're dealing with multi-factor\n\n684\n00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:55,775\nauthentication.\n\n685\n00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:56,750\nSomething you have.\n\n686\n00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,210\nAnd something you know, right?\n\n687\n00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,790\nSo the smart card is something\nyou physically have in your hand.\n\n688\n00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,334\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then there's a pin number that's\n\n689\n00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,071\nsomething you know.\n\n690\n00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:05,360\n>> Right.\n>> And when you sit down at your computer\n\n691\n00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,700\nyou pop in your smart card,\nyou type in your pin number, you pro,\n\n692\n00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,120\nprovided your two.\n\n693\n00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,030\nForms of authentication and\nnow you're allowed in.\n\n694\n00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,860\nWith a virtual smart card,\n\n695\n00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,325\nthe virtual smart card is stored in\nthe motherboard in, in the TPM right?\n\n696\n00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:19,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n697\n00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,500\n>> So you sit down, and the TPM on\nthe motherboard is something you have,\n\n698\n00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,690\nand then you still have that PIN\nthat's something you know, all right?\n\n699\n00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,350\nSo, so\nyou still have that same functionality.\n\n700\n00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,490\nIt's just instead of a physical\nsmart card in your hand,\n\n701\n00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,750\nit's a virtual smart\ncard stored in the TPM.\n\n702\n00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,154\nNow, if somebody steals your hard drive\nright, or steals the whole computer,\n\n703\n00:27:38,154 --> 00:27:40,795\nyes they have [CROSSTALK]\nyour smart card right?\n\n704\n00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:44,099\nBut, they don't have your pin number\n[CROSSTALK] alright, so they were able to\n\n705\n00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:47,367\nget one of the forms of authentication and\nnot the other So it is still secure.\n\n706\n00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,950\nIt's not as secure-\n>> Yeah.\n\n707\n00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,710\n>> Right?\nAs a, as an actual smart card.\n\n708\n00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,475\nI, I know I, I did some work for\nthe navy at one point and\n\n709\n00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:57,545\nwh,when I got on base they\ngave me a a smart card.\n\n710\n00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And it was on a little elastic tether.\n\n711\n00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,290\n>> Right.\n>> That you attach to your belt.\n\n712\n00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,480\nAnd so you know, it was your ID and\n\n713\n00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,970\nthe idea was you'd sit down on your\ncomputer and you'd plug in the smart card.\n\n714\n00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,820\nBut it was tethered to your hip.\n\n715\n00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,200\n>> Mm.\n>> And so if you got up to walk away it\n\n716\n00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,640\nwould snag out the smart card.\n\n717\n00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,191\nAnd so you were guaranteed to lock [LAUGH]\nyour computer when you walked away.\n\n718\n00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:18,960\nCuz you couldn't walk away without\nthe smart card comin' off.\n\n719\n00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,835\n>> All right.\n>> And it was a great design.\n\n720\n00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:21,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n721\n00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,100\n>> When it's a TPM built in to the system\nthough, you can walk away with that\n\n722\n00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,930\nsmartcard still in there and so you end up\nbasically with one form of authentication.\n\n723\n00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> At that point.\n\n724\n00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,670\nUnless, somebody steals\njust the hard drive.\n\n725\n00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,730\n>> Right.\n>> Then you've got your two forms.\n\n726\n00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,870\nSo it is not as strong.\n\n727\n00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,360\n>> Right.\n>> But it is still good security.\n\n728\n00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,700\n>> Okay. Yep. >> Sounds good.\n\n729\n00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,620\nYep.\n>> All right.\n\n730\n00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,690\nThe the last entry that we have on,\n\n731\n00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,450\non our new one\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n732\n00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,460\n>> Is another security feature.\n\n733\n00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,520\n>> Right.\n>> Which is called Secure Boot.\n\n734\n00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,110\n>> Yeah.\n>> And Secure Boot is much\n\n735\n00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,180\nmaligned on the internet.\n\n736\n00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> A lot of people hate it.\n\n737\n00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,680\nBut I think it's a great idea.\n\n738\n00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> It it is a,\n\n739\n00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,290\na new feature that basically says only\ndigitally signed boot loaders can\n\n740\n00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,130\nfire up when the system\n>> Turns on, right?\n\n741\n00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> A lot of, of Windows 7 and\n\n742\n00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,910\nearlier machines were starting\nto fall victim to rootkits.\n\n743\n00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,560\n>> Right.\n\n744\n00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,680\n>> And rootkits are bad news.\n\n745\n00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,280\n>> They are.\n\n746\n00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,860\n>> When you get a, an attacker who\ninstalls malware on your machine\n\n747\n00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,230\nas a rootkit,\nit's underneath the operating system.\n\n748\n00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,240\nIt's completely able to hide itself and\n\n749\n00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,240\nit's able to manipulate anything\nyour operating system does.\n\n750\n00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,210\nIt is the worst kind of,\nof infection a machine can get.\n\n751\n00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,140\nAll right.\n\n752\n00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,040\nWell, when your system boots up,\nit has to load that rootkit\n\n753\n00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,610\nprior to loading the OS so\nthat it can be underneath it.\n\n754\n00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,060\nAnd so what Microsoft said was,\nyou know what, forget it.\n\n755\n00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,220\nWe're going to digitally sign our OS.\n\n756\n00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,180\nAnd if the computer is set to only\nallow digitally signed OSes to boot,\n\n757\n00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,870\nwe just won't digitally sign any rootkits,\nright?\n\n758\n00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,695\nSo it completely kills off the ability for\na rootkit to function.\n\n759\n00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:51,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's great.\n\n760\n00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,170\nBut the open source community,\nyou know, the, the Linux distros and\n\n761\n00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,408\nBSD distros and stuff.\n\n762\n00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:59,006\nJust were [CROSSTALK] in an uproar,\nsaying, well, what,\n\n763\n00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,560\nnow we got our stuff signed by\nMicrosoft if we want to run?\n\n764\n00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,523\nAnd Microsoft said yes.\n\n765\n00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:05,955\n[LAUGH] And they've, they've, they've\nkind of worked it out since then, so\n\n766\n00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:08,607\nthere's a couple of,\nof digital signing bodies, and, and\n\n767\n00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,540\nyou can disable-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n768\n00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,680\n>> This if you want.\n\n769\n00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,990\nBut if you leave it on.\n\n770\n00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,600\nIf you leave secure boot\nturned on in your system and\n\n771\n00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,525\nyou're running Windows, then rootkits are,\n\n772\n00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,390\nare basically impossible to get\n>> Right.\n\n773\n00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,920\n>> And so\nit's a great leap forward in security.\n\n774\n00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,560\nIf you're running Linux or\nsomething like that,\n\n775\n00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,600\nyou'll probably have to\nturn secure boot off.\n\n776\n00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,910\n>> Yeah.\n\n777\n00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,735\nNow the only hardware requirement\nthat we have right now is that UEFI.\n\n778\n00:30:30,735 --> 00:30:32,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The Unified Extensible Firmware\n\n779\n00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,865\nInterface, which I'll probably won't\nremember how to say that again.\n\n780\n00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ever here.\n\n781\n00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,820\nSo that's again another form\nof BIOS essentially for\n\n782\n00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,710\nus, that does allow for the, the,\nthe digital signing to, to happen fairly,\n\n783\n00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,550\nI, I guess relatively easier than,\nthan the original BIOS.\n\n784\n00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,400\n>> Yeah, and you know, in the past you\nturn on your computer and the BIOS,\n\n785\n00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,260\nthe basic input, output system would kick\nin, and it would find the first hard\n\n786\n00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,060\ndrive, and the first bootable partition\non that hard drive, and that's what\n\n787\n00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,030\nit would boot you know, that's where it\nwould go and find it's, it's bootloader.\n\n788\n00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,870\nSo, very simple system,\nhas been around forever.\n\n789\n00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,020\nWith UEFI, it basically replaces that.\n\n790\n00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,870\nYour BIOS still boots,\ncause it's gotta initialize hardware.\n\n791\n00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:14,130\nBut then it turns over control to UEFI\nwhich locates a, a basically unencrypted\n\n792\n00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,895\npartition that lists all the various OSes\nand is able to fire them up from there.\n\n793\n00:31:18,895 --> 00:31:22,090\n>> Yep.\n>> And it's UEFI that's enabling us to\n\n794\n00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,580\ncheck a digital signature\nprior to booting an OS.\n\n795\n00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,435\nThat we can only run digitally\nsigned operating systems.\n\n796\n00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:29,070\n>> Right.\n>> This is the way of the future.\n\n797\n00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,530\nWe're going to see secure boot on more and\nmore systems as we go.\n\n798\n00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,375\nIt is very, very common.\n\n799\n00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,476\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n800\n00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,394\nRight.\n\n801\n00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,134\n>> So.\n\n802\n00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:37,930\nAll right.\n\n803\n00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,490\nSo, so that kind of wraps up some\nof the new security features and\n\n804\n00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,940\nsome of the hardware requirements.\n\n805\n00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,800\n>> Mm.\n>> That's, that's really our,\n\n806\n00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,140\nour goal at this segment is\n>> Right.\n\n807\n00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,068\n>> Some of the hardware considerations\nwe needed to, to keep in mind before\n\n808\n00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:49,885\npurchasing a Windows 8.1 machine\nwhere we're building our own.\n\n809\n00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:50,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n810\n00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,010\n>> So, alright Ronnie can you think of\nanything else to add in on this one?\n\n811\n00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,980\n>> I can't,\nI think we've added in the 8.1 features.\n\n812\n00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,690\n>> Alright.\n\n813\n00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,400\nWell, I hope you guys enjoyed it, and\nwe'll see you in our next mini-segment as\n\n814\n00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:10,172\nwe continue to add the,\nthe new Windows 8.1 objectives.\n\n815\n00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:12,460\n[SOUND]\n\n",

That's right.\n\n4\n00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,420\n>> Of ITPRO-TV as we go and tackle some of\nthe new objectives added in Windows 8.1.\n\n5\n00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,140\nFor those of you studying for the Windows\n8 exam, er, particularly the 70-687 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,210\nThere was an update in January,\n2014, that added some new objectives.\n\n7\n00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,769\nAnd today we're gonna talk\nabout one of those objectives\n\n8\n00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:29,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n9\n00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,980\n>> Right.\nAnd in particular we're looking at\n\n10\n00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,200\nobjective let's see what is this 2.5 and\n2.6 in our handy dandy objective list.\n\n11\n00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,130\nWhich is installing\nadditional Windows features\n\n12\n00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,855\nas well as configuring Windows for\nadditional languages.\n\n13\n00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so we're gonna take a look at\n\n14\n00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,760\nsome of these things that are not\n\n15\n00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,990\ninstalled with Windows by default bu that\nwe have to kind of add after the fact.\n\n16\n00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,690\n>> Yep.\n\n17\n00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,580\n>> All right so\n>> So,\n\n18\n00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,230\nlet's start with this adding\nWindows feature thing.\n\n19\n00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,880\nAll right.\nSo, let's start with objective 2.5.\n\n20\n00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,250\nWe're gonna take a look at installing\nadditional Windows features in.\n\n21\n00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,150\nAnd what they're talking about here is,\nthere's a lot of neat stuff\n\n22\n00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,650\nthat comes included with Windows 8.1, but\nthen, it's just not installed by default.\n\n23\n00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,310\n>> Right.\n>> And, and there's\n\n24\n00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,302\nvarious reasons for that, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:10,357\nSome of it, maybe Microsoft said,\nthis is just not a popular feature, so\n\n26\n00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:11,769\nwe don't want [CROSSTALK]\n>> No.\n\n27\n00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,080\n>> Everybody to do it.\nSome of it's like of a security reason.\n\n28\n00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,500\nThey decided not to do it, and you have to\nconscientiously make the effort to weaken\n\n29\n00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,120\nthe security of the system.\n\n30\n00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,430\n>> Now, this is not exactly brand new.\n\n31\n00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,060\nWe've always been able to\nactually add in more features.\n\n32\n00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,660\nIn previous editions of\noperating systems here.\n\n33\n00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,260\nBut because the interface changes that\nwe've had from previous editions,\n\n34\n00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,520\nto Windows 8.\n\n35\n00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,020\nIt is a little bit harder to actually\nfind, but we still can do it.\n\n36\n00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,380\nSo we want to make sure that you actually\nhave a good understanding of how to go and\n\n37\n00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,710\nadd some additional features and\n\n38\n00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,620\nthen, we'll talk about the idea of adding\nin additional language features as well.\n\n39\n00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,580\n>> Now for features Ronnie,\nI still kind of use the old way,\n\n40\n00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,810\nI don't know if there's a new way or not.\n\n41\n00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,910\nBut let's take a look at my computer here.\n\n42\n00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,300\nAnd if I fire up my start screen,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n43\n00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,960\n>> And just type in feature.\n\n44\n00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,500\n>> Yep.\n>> You'll see that programs and\n\n45\n00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,590\nfeatures right there.\n\n46\n00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,730\nYou also have add features to Windows 8.1.\n\n47\n00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,380\nSo this is kinda the old way and then\nyou've got your, your new way right there.\n\n48\n00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,990\nAnd so I'll, I'll, I'll fire that up here.\n\n49\n00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,910\nSo so basically you know,\nit's going to come in and\n\n50\n00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,390\nit's going to tell you\nwhat it's going to do.\n\n51\n00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,670\nNow, the old Feature screen was allowing\nyou to add features that just weren't\n\n52\n00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,705\ninstalled by default.\n\n53\n00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The new feature screen is allowing you\n\n54\n00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,103\nto add features that you purchased-\n>> Yeah.\n\n55\n00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:22,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> From Microsoft, and you might say,\n\n56\n00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,600\nwell wait a minute, purchase?\n\n57\n00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,730\nWell, this can be-\n>> Yeah.\n\n58\n00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,210\n>> Something as simple as an\n>> Upgrade from Windows 8 Standard or\n\n59\n00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,620\nWindows 8 Pro-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n60\n00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,690\n>> Or it can be something more complex\nlike Windows 8 Media Center Edition.\n\n61\n00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,025\nWindows 7 and earlier had this\nWindows Media Center built in,-\n\n62\n00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:38,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n63\n00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,420\n>> and Windows 8 is now a charged feature,\nI think they charge, think they charge\n\n64\n00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,020\nlike $12 for it or something-\n>> Yeah.\n\n65\n00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,310\n>> It's not an outrageous amount,\nbut they do charge for it.\n\n66\n00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,560\nAnd so if you go onto Microsoft's website\nand you buy the Windows Media Center\n\n67\n00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,310\nfeature, well, they'll give you\na product key and you come in here and\n\n68\n00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,930\nyou say I have the product key, and\nyou put it in and it unlocks that feature.\n\n69\n00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,200\nIf you don't you can go to buy it online.\n\n70\n00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,600\nAnd oh, oh, apparently\n>> $10.\n\n71\n00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,380\nYeah.\n>> that's the only one we\n\n72\n00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,110\ngot and it's $10.\n\n73\n00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,690\nSo the Windows 8.1\nMedia Center Package for $10.\n\n74\n00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,750\n>> I dunno, you should choose the help\nme choose feature down there.\n\n75\n00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,532\nI'm just- [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, help me choose.\n\n76\n00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:13,531\nThere's just so many options to pick\nfrom here [CROSSTALK] one product.\n\n77\n00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:15,640\n>> I was joking but- [LAUGH] Oh,\nnow looky there.\n\n78\n00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,230\n>> Well here,\nhere they have the upgrade, right?\n\n79\n00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:17,950\nSo\n>> Yeah\n\n80\n00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,152\n>> So, just Windows 8.1 Regular,\n\n81\n00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:21,420\nWindows 8.1 Pro.\n\n82\n00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,600\nAnd so, you know,\nthey're basically kind of laying that out.\n\n83\n00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,620\nBut, but you can buy these and,\nyou know, extend out Windows.\n\n84\n00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,420\nNow, that's a pay feature.\n\n85\n00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:29,920\n>> Right.\n\n86\n00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,970\n>> What about the free ones?\n\n87\n00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,430\n>> Right.\n>> Well, the free ones,\n\n88\n00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,250\nyou gotta go back to the old\nscreen that I was going to first.\n\n89\n00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,780\n>> So, if I go back here, instead of\nusing the add features to Windows 8.1,\n\n90\n00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,930\nI can choose programs and features and\n\n91\n00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,080\nin here you'll see turn Window's features\non or off, these are the free features.\n\n92\n00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,840\nSo we can go in and we can see\nvarious things that may not be turned\n\n93\n00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,600\non with the default install\n>> One of the big things that jumps\n\n94\n00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,170\nout is Hyper V.\n\n95\n00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> You want to do virtualization?\n\n96\n00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,570\nIt's a lot of fun if you've got\nthe hardware that supports it.\n\n97\n00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,100\nYou just have to install it.\n\n98\n00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,160\nMicrosoft knows that most end users don't\neven know what Hyper V is, better yet\n\n99\n00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,060\nwhen to use it, so\nthey don't install it by default.\n\n100\n00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,130\n>> Right.\n>> It's up to us to add it.\n\n101\n00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,990\nYou'll see some other, what are some\npopular ones that I usually add?\n\n102\n00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:17,030\nI usually add the Telnet client, just\nbecause I do so much networking stuff.\n\n103\n00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:21,380\nTellNet is an unencrypted shell protocol,\nso it's not very secure, so\n\n104\n00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,870\nMicrosoft disables it by default.\n\n105\n00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,990\nTell that server, it really don't\nhave a practical use for that one.\n\n106\n00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,440\nIt's terribly insecure, and so again,\nMicrosoft leaves that disabled.\n\n107\n00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,670\nBut they include the functionality\njust incase you do have that need,\n\n108\n00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,090\nyou can come in and turn that on.\n\n109\n00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,930\n>> Yeah, I think I remember\nlike I know this is way back in\n\n110\n00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,080\nthe Vista Business days.\n\n111\n00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,270\nWhere one of the features you have to add\nin are the games that used to be installed\n\n112\n00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,950\nin Windows.\n\n113\n00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,280\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> So yeah, everyone was like,\n\n114\n00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,150\nwell how, where did all my games go to?\n\n115\n00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,390\nAnd you had to come in and\nactually do something like this.\n\n116\n00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> And today, we just have to go to\n\n117\n00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,250\nthe Windows store.\n\n118\n00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,180\n>> If you wanted your Solitaire and\nall that.\n\n119\n00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,530\nYeah.\n>> Yeah, you have to add that in.\n\n120\n00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,400\n>> A lot of this has been\nmoved over to the App Store.\n\n121\n00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,980\nAnd in fact, you know when you install\nWindows 8.1, you don't have Solitaire,\n\n122\n00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,950\nand Freecell.\n\n123\n00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,530\nBut they are free in the App Store.\n\n124\n00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,380\nYou just go and download them.\n\n125\n00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,570\nAlthough, they are ad supported now.\n\n126\n00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,910\nThey didn't used to be like that.\n\n127\n00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,130\nBut, yeah you can get them there.\n\n128\n00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,370\nBut, for this objective, they are not so\nmuch talking about the Windows Store.\n\n129\n00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,650\nThat's in other objectives.\n\n130\n00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,570\nThey are really wanting you to focus\non that idea of, we can go out and\n\n131\n00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,725\npurchase add-ons for Windows 8.1.\n\n132\n00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:22,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The media center package,\n\n133\n00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,325\nthe big example.\n\n134\n00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n135\n00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,180\nyou can add in some of the free features\nthat are already built in using the,\n\n136\n00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,485\nthe, term Windows features\nin an off screen.\n\n137\n00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n138\n00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,650\nYup.\n\n139\n00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,790\n>> So those are the two.\n\n140\n00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,850\nAnd you know for a lot of people if you\ndon't have a need for any of those.\n\n141\n00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,720\nThen you, you just\n>> Yeah.\n\n142\n00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,170\n>> You never go into those screens.\n\n143\n00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,650\nAnd it's not a big deal right?\n\n144\n00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> But but if you're like me and\n\n145\n00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,400\nyou need that Telnet client I\ncan go get a third party one.\n\n146\n00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,255\nOr I can just use Microsoft it's\nbuilt in I just have to turn it on.\n\n147\n00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:50,585\n>> Mm-hm\n>> The other cool one is the Microsoft\n\n148\n00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:51,115\nlanguages.\n\n149\n00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:53,371\nAnd Microsoft has done a big.\n\n150\n00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:54,053\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n151\n00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:58,045\n>> 360, turn around on, on how they.\n\n152\n00:05:58,045 --> 00:05:58,570\n>> 180.\n>> A 180, there we go.\n\n153\n00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,095\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:00,135\n>> A 360 would just put you\n\n155\n00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:03,635\nback right where they are.\nSo, they've done a big turn around on they\n\n156\n00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:05,565\nway they handle languages in Windows.\n>> Yeah.\n\n157\n00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,216\n>> Right,\n\n158\n00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:07,996\n>> In previous ver, versions of Windows.\n\n159\n00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:09,076\nLike back in the Windows XP\n\n160\n00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:09,850\ndays and stuff.\n\n161\n00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,690\nYou bought what were called\nlocalized copies of Windows.\n\n162\n00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,797\n>> Mhm.\n>> If you bought a copy of Windows in\n\n163\n00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:18,610\nthe United States of America it was\nset for US English and that was it.\n\n164\n00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,305\n>> Right.\n\n165\n00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:23,000\n>> But if you bought it in Canada,\nit came with U.S.\n\n166\n00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,515\nEnglish again, and Canadian French, right.\n\n167\n00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:30,995\nBecause there's several provinces in,\nthere not provinces.\n\n168\n00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:32,005\nWhat are they called?\n\n169\n00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,390\n>> Territories.\n\n170\n00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,030\n>> Territories?\n\n171\n00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,780\nI think that's right.\n\n172\n00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,330\nWell anyhow, you know, whatever the,\nlike the, the people in\n\n173\n00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,440\nQuebec where they speak French as much\nif not more than they speak English.\n\n174\n00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,110\nAnd so they would sell localized versions\nof Windows there that had both French and\n\n175\n00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,280\nEnglish, all right?\n\n176\n00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,140\nNow,\n>> Every version of Windows\n\n177\n00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,660\nsupports multi-language keyboards.\n\n178\n00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,960\nBut what about what's on your screen?\n\n179\n00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n180\n00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,790\n>> What about that Start button that says,\nyou know, Start for us in English.\n\n181\n00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,350\nBut in another language, it'll say,\nyou know, something different in,\n\n182\n00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,070\nin that particular language.\n\n183\n00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,960\nWell, to change the user interface\nin previous versions of Windows,\n\n184\n00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,740\nyou had to go and buy a localized version.\n\n185\n00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,670\n>> Right.\n>> Of Windows.\n\n186\n00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,530\nIn Windows 8.1, and it's not new to 8.1.\n\n187\n00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,870\nThey actually started this in Vista.\n\n188\n00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,980\nBut in our newer versions of Windows,\n\n189\n00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,530\nyou can add more than one language-\n>> Yeah.\n\n190\n00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,440\n>> Right here.\n\n191\n00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,708\nIf you're running Windows 8.1 Pro, right?\n\n192\n00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,680\n8.1 standard-\n>> I know [INAUDIBLE]\n\n193\n00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,430\n>> I think, still has\n\n194\n00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,360\nthe localization, doesn't it Ronnie?\n\n195\n00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n196\n00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,305\n>> So adding languages,\nthough, is super easy.\n\n197\n00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:31,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All we do,\n\n198\n00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,340\n>> I'll just bring up my\n\n199\n00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,030\nstart screen here.\n\n200\n00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,760\nI'm gonna swipe in from the right side,\nand, oh, I guess my head's covering it,\n\n201\n00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,292\nbut I'm,\nI'm gonna hit that Settings button.\n\n202\n00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, let's, let's do this.\n\n203\n00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,080\nOh, p, perfect.\n\n204\n00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,920\nThank you, Jason.\n\n205\n00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,287\nSo, so I'll just swipe in from the right\nside here, and I'm gonna go to Settings.\n\n206\n00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:51,658\nAnd once I'm in Settings, I'm gonna go all\nthe way down here to the bottom where it's\n\n207\n00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:54,949\ngot this Change PC

and\nlanguage, yes.\n\n210\n00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,860\nAnd once we browse in there,\nyou've got Region and language.\n\n211\n00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,610\nSo 20 clicks later, we, we'll get to this.\n\n212\n00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,790\nThere we go.\n\n213\n00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,980\nAnd it's showing that right now I\nhave English United States installed,\n\n214\n00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,810\nbecause you know that's what I\npicked when I installed Windows.\n\n215\n00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,920\nRight, when you install it,\nit asks you, and that's what I picked.\n\n216\n00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,720\nAll right?\n\n217\n00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,250\nAnd it, it says that I'm in\nthe United States and so on.\n\n218\n00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,040\nI can change that, and\nwe can add in other languages.\n\n219\n00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,630\nAnd, when you add in languages,\nthere are a lot.\n\n220\n00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,650\nI forget the exact number.\n\n221\n00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,458\n>> Yeah.\n>> Something like 60 different languages.\n\n222\n00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:35,310\nBut you'll see there's, there's several\ndifferent forms of Chinese, and, and\n\n223\n00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,957\nthere's Cyrillic languages as well\nas traditional Latin languages and-\n\n224\n00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:40,257\n>> Central.\n\n225\n00:08:40,257

00:08:46,918\nYeah.\n\n229\n00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,118\n>> Yeah, I'm not familiar with tamazghit.\n\n230\n00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:50,398\nI wonder what entry it is that comes from.\n\n231\n00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,958\nAnyhow, theres some\nreally cool ones in here.\n\n232\n00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,480\n>> Yea.\n>> You just kind of explore around.\n\n233\n00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,790\nBut you'll see ones that are, you know,\n\n234\n00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,350\na lot of countries that have different\nalphabets, that don't use the traditional.\n\n235\n00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,980\nWhat is it, the Arabic alphabet,\nthe what is our alphabet called?\n\n236\n00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,330\nSome Latin alphabet right?\n\n237\n00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,150\n>> Roman.\n>> Roman, the Roman alphabet.\n\n238\n00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,590\nSo, a lot of countries in\ntheir languages use that.\n\n239\n00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,380\nOther countries, like you know, Vietnam.\n\n240\n00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,060\nRight, Vietnamese is,\nthey have a very unique alphabet, really.\n\n241\n00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,820\nYou know,\nkind of how the language is written.\n\n242\n00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,790\nSo, you know,\nyou'll see that as you browse through it.\n\n243\n00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,920\n>> Right.\n>> And see, these, these variations.\n\n244\n00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,870\nAnd, in here you can find\nwhatever it is that you speak.\n\n245\n00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,700\nSo, I'm, I'm gonna pick one that I'm at\nleast moderately familiar with, which is,\n\n246\n00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,660\nis French.\n\n247\n00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,569\nAnd, and, you know,\ntheir alphabet's pretty much like ours.\n\n248\n00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,107\nAll right.\nNow, when I pick French, well-\n\n249\n00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:38,847\n>> No.\n\n250\n00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:39,809\nNo, now you're [CROSSTALK]\n>> There's\n\n251\n00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:40,727\nseveral countries that speak French.\n\n252\n00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:41,647\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n253\n00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,028\nSo, so I have to pick which\nvariation of French that I want.\n\n254\n00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:47,748\nI can go Canadian or, or whatever.\n\n255\n00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:51,328\nI'll go, I'll go with actual France.\n\n256\n00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:52,107\nAll right.\n\n257\n00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:57,374\nSo now I've got France added in here, and\nit shows that language pack available and\n\n258\n00:09:57,374 --> 00:10:02,207\nit, it lets me know that I've,\nI've got it and I'm ready to rock, right?\n\n259\n00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,347\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now.\n\n260\n00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:05,458\n>> I'm gonna trust you on\nthe French cuz now I'm toast.\n\n261\n00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,812\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, this,\n\n262\n00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,198\nthis is kind of where it gets fun,\nisn't it?\n\n263\n00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:11,638\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose to set that as my primary.\n\n264\n00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:12,338\nThere we go.\n\n265\n00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:15,757\nSo now that's my primary and\nI think I have to do a Windows update.\n\n266\n00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:17,457\nSee how it says language pack available?\n\n267\n00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,062\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm pretty sure that I\n\n268\n00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:22,010\nneed do a Windows update before\nit actually takes effect.\n\n269\n00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:28,360\nSo let me just check for updates and\nlet's see what it picks up.\n\n270\n00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,730\nYou know, a lot of these features\nare built into Windows 8 and so\n\n271\n00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,110\nwhen you do the install there\nthey kind of tag along.\n\n272\n00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,722\nBut sometimes you have to do a windows\neight update and this one doesn't.\n\n273\n00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,620\nAll right so\nit's looks like we're in business.\n\n274\n00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,230\nI did set that as my primary language, but\nit doesn't take effect until I log out.\n\n275\n00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,770\nSo let's, let's do this cuz my, my remote\ndesktop share is gonna disconnect.\n\n276\n00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,430\nSo, give me a minute here,\nI'm gonna log out.\n\n277\n00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,080\nAnd, and then we'll,\nwe'll see this take effect.\n\n278\n00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,680\nRight so.\n>> Now, now Doug did a cautious one.\n\n279\n00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,440\nAt least he picked a language\nhe is somewhat familiar with.\n\n280\n00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,084\nI would have just gone in there and\npicked any language and\n\n281\n00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:04,737\nthen that would have been toast at this\npoint, once this would've happened.\n\n282\n00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:06,858\nYou know,\n>> Yeah.\n\n283\n00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:07,768\n[LAUGH]\n>> The\n\n284\n00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:08,708\n>> Throw caution to the wind.\n\n285\n00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:12,736\n>> The first time I bought an iPod,\nand I know, it's an Apple product,\n\n286\n00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:13,788\nnot a Microsoft.\n\n287\n00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,884\nBut yeah, the first time I bought an iPod,\nI just, I screwed up when,\n\n288\n00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,787\nwhen I turned it on, and I picked Chinese.\n\n289\n00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:19,627\n>> There you go.\n[LAUGH]\n\n290\n00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,607\n>> And and, you know, after that,\n\n291\n00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:25,241\nthe whole screen was rendered in,\nin Chinese, and I couldn't even recognize\n\n292\n00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:28,350\nthe characters that you hd to\nfind the menu, and so on, so.\n\n293\n00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,910\nI ended up having to go online and\n\n294\n00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,900\nit turns out I wasn't the only person\nwho did it and they had like a list of\n\n295\n00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,570\nthe characters that you had to\nhit to put it back into English.\n\n296\n00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,219\nSo you can you can mess up.\n\n297\n00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:43,059\nAll right so I am just restarting my\nlaptop here and once it restarts.\n\n298\n00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:43,917\n>> Yeah.\n>> In theory,\n\n299\n00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:47,382\nI should be able to switch between\nEnglish and French pretty handily and and\n\n300\n00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,864\nwhen I say switch between English and\nFrench, you know,\n\n301\n00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:52,180\nwhat I'm switching is the user interface-\n>> Interface.\n\n302\n00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,740\n>> For Windows, right?\n\n303\n00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,604\nAll of the little titles and\nstuff like that popping in Windows,\n\n304\n00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:57,239\neven your icon names change-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n305\n00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:01,819\n>> You know, your control panel and stuff\n>> We'll all have different terminology.\n\n306\n00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:02,980\n>> Yeah.\n\n307\n00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,670\nI, I've, I've had this happen\nwhile I've been teaching like a,\n\n308\n00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,201\nan Excel class here and there, where\nI actually ended up having users that\n\n309\n00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:14,140\nactually came from different\ncountries like Korea.\n\n310\n00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then,\n\n311\n00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,236\nof course, if, if I ended up teaching\nanother class and I forgot to go back and\n\n312\n00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:19,229\nchange those settings.\n\n313\n00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:21,559\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was quite a surprise to the.\n\n314\n00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:23,101\n>> To the next person\nthat actually came in\n\n315\n00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:23,759\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n316\n00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:24,699\nYeah.\n>> And did this.\n\n317\n00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:25,624\n>> Yeah.\nYou know,\n\n318\n00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:27,532\nthe, the other thing to keep in mind is,\n\n319\n00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:30,300\na lot of foreign languages\nalso use a different keyboard.\n\n320\n00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,880\n>> Keyboard, yeah.\n\n321\n00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,660\n>> Layout, right?\n\n322\n00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,560\nSo, even though you have a US keyboard\nattached if, if it moved into French.\n\n323\n00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,160\nSo, It's like a.\n\n324\n00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,720\n>> Right.\n>> On a,\n\n325\n00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,185\non a US keyboard on the top row\nwe have what's called qwerty.\n\n326\n00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:43,070\nQ-W-E-R-T-Y.\n\n327\n00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,690\nBut on a French keyboard,\nit's AZERTY, A-Z-E-R-T-Y,\n\n328\n00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,570\nso the keys are in different places.\n\n329\n00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,300\n>> Right.\n>> So, when you flip a language,\n\n330\n00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,720\na lot of times, that will flip your,\nyour keyboard also, and so\n\n331\n00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,160\nyou have to be aware of that, right?\n\n332\n00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,100\nYou have to be aware that,\nthat these things are,\n\n333\n00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600\nare kind of going back and forth, and.\n\n334\n00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,980\nAnd so it can make it where you think\nyou're typing your right password\n\n335\n00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,580\nbut you're not.\n\n336\n00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,920\nAnd actually I'm bumping\ninto that right now.\n\n337\n00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,010\nAnd I can't show you guys my login screen.\n\n338\n00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,670\nBut my keyword was sent to\nthe French keyboard and\n\n339\n00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,980\nmy password has some special characters\nin it and it wasn't letting me log in.\n\n340\n00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,650\nCause cause the lay out is different\nfrom a French keyboard, so\n\n341\n00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,800\nI have to flip it to English.\n\n342\n00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,739\nAnd, you know, my,\nmy user interface did not change.\n\n343\n00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:31,996\nHang on just a second here, let me\nfind out why that got angry at me and\n\n344\n00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:32,890\ndidn't switch.\n\n345\n00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,580\nOh, shoot!\n\n346\n00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,270\nOkay, let me bring this up so\nI can show the viewers.\n\n347\n00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,780\nI forgot a step.\n\n348\n00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,140\nAll right so let me,\nlet me share my desktop again.\n\n349\n00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,580\nSo you guys will be able to see it and\nI'll show you what I forgot.\n\n350\n00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,640\nAll right, remember how I said,\n\n351\n00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,540\nI thought I needed to do a Windows\nupdate to get the language pack right?\n\n352\n00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,830\nWell, I did a quick check and\nthere weren't any Windows updates listed.\n\n353\n00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,900\nJason, can we go full-screen for a second?\n\n354\n00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,432\nThere we go.\n\n355\n00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:06,652\nAll right, down in my system tray\ndown here, you'll see this FRA.\n\n356\n00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:10,170\nAll right, that's letting me know which\nkeyboard layout I'm using right now.\n\n357\n00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,810\nSo I'm using the French keyboard layout\nwhich, you know, was a slight problem for\n\n358\n00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,820\nme logging in.\n\n359\n00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,320\nAnd I can just tap on that to\nswitch between a French and\n\n360\n00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,830\nEnglish keyboard layout.\n\n361\n00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,530\nAll right?\n\n362\n00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,740\nNotice beneath it I've got\nmy language preferences.\n\n363\n00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,180\nAnd if I go into that,\nI'll see right here I've got French and\n\n364\n00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,610\nit's showing available for\ndownload keyboard layout French.\n\n365\n00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,980\nI didn't actually download that\nlanguage pack like it was supposed to.\n\n366\n00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,230\nSo I'm just gonna click on it and\nchoose to download and\n\n367\n00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,680\ninstall that language pack.\n\n368\n00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,990\nSo here it goes it's going to download and\ninstall it.\n\n369\n00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,010\nNotice that it's 86 MB right?\n\n370\n00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,108\nThis is not just text.\n\n371\n00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:48,648\nIn a lot of cases it has\nto download new artwork.\n\n372\n00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:49,208\n>> Right.\n\n373\n00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,047\n>> Because there'll be an image that has,\nyou know, welcome.\n\n374\n00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:53,648\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And so\n\n375\n00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:57,821\nit needs to change it to you know\na different terminology there to match up\n\n376\n00:14:57,821 --> 00:14:59,247\nwith the other language.\n\n377\n00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:00,607\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n378\n00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,319\n>> We'll give it just a second\nwhile it downloads and\n\n379\n00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,968\nit's just pulling this\nright from Microsoft.\n\n380\n00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:05,268\n>> There's updates that\ncome out to this stuff.\n\n381\n00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:06,308\n>> Right.\n>> Pretty frequently.\n\n382\n00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:10,440\nAnd so we you know we get those as part of\nWindows updates once the language pack is\n\n383\n00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,128\ninstalled.\n\n384\n00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:12,928\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n385\n00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:16,307\n>> All right look like it's almost done.\n\n386\n00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:19,992\nNow that I said something the bar is gonna\ndo that crazy thing where it goes back to\n\n387\n00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,807\nzero and you sit here and\nweigh it and it it does nothing.\n\n388\n00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:25,330\nNow you can run as many\nlanguages as you want.\n\n389\n00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,828\nSo, you guys saw there\nwere like 60 languages.\n\n390\n00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:31,517\nI can go and add in every one of them and\nswitch between them and blow your mind,\n\n391\n00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:36,568\nbut it's really only useful for people\nthat are, you know, maybe you're like a,\n\n392\n00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:41,438\nhere in the U.S. we have ESL teachers,\nright, English as a second language.\n\n393\n00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:44,198\nAnd so you know,\nyou work at an elementary school and\n\n394\n00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,421\nyou have students that speak fluent\nSpanish, but they're learning English.\n\n395\n00:15:48,421 --> 00:15:53,308\nAnd so, to take the computer out as\nan obstacle, you might switch the computer\n\n396\n00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:56,874\nover to Spanish so\nthey can learn how to use the computer.\n\n397\n00:15:56,874 --> 00:16:00,171\nAnd then switch it back to English and\nnow they can focus on learning English.\n\n398\n00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:04,160\nYou know you an use it for things like\nthat or maybe you're just multilingual.\n\n399\n00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,100\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you want to switch between them.\n\n400\n00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,180\nOr maybe you bought your computer here\nin the US but you live in, in Germany.\n\n401\n00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> You speak German and that,\n\n402\n00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,930\nthat's your language.\n\n403\n00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,800\nWell, you can flip it over to German.\n\n404\n00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,875\nAnd, and you can actually uninstall\nthe English pack if you want.\n\n405\n00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or you can just ignore it.\n\n406\n00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,860\n>> Right.\n>> And, and go that way.\n\n407\n00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,410\nSo, so it's kind of cool that it's\nnot as regional as it used to be.\n\n408\n00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,652\n>> Right.\n\n409\n00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:26,653\n>> All right, so after a,\na little while of watching a green bar go.\n\n410\n00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And after a quick log out and\n\n411\n00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,620\nlog back in, my system is now in French.\n\n412\n00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,490\nAnd, and I can spot that,\nbecause I no longer have a Start screen.\n\n413\n00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,550\nI now have an Accueil screen,\nand so I can, I can see this,\n\n414\n00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,340\nyou know, the, for\nthe most part looks the same.\n\n415\n00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,250\nWe changed the language for Windows.\n\n416\n00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,365\nWe didn't change the language for\nour Apps.\n\n417\n00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:49,094\n>> Right.\n>> So, I still have Netflix and Splashtop,\n\n418\n00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:50,094\nmy Fruit Ninjas.\n\n419\n00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,042\n>> Oh, there we go.\n\n420\n00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:54,992\n>> It's still telling me I have an arcade\nhigh score of eight zero zero or\n\n421\n00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:55,749\nsomething.\n\n422\n00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,603\nSo, you know your apps,\nits up to each app.\n\n423\n00:16:57,603 --> 00:16:59,462\n>> Right.\n>> To switch between languages or\n\n424\n00:16:59,462 --> 00:17:03,412\nwhatever, but Windows itself is now,\nin, in French.\n\n425\n00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:06,692\nAnd you'll see it throughout\nthe operating system.\n\n426\n00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,312\n>> There you go.\n\n427\n00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:11,873\n>> If I go into my, my system control\npanel you'll see it's now got an accent\n\n428\n00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:14,613\naccent, what is it, accent aigu,\naccent vergu, whatever it's called.\n\n429\n00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,361\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I can go in there and\n\n430\n00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:19,951\nI can see you know things\nthat I'm used to seeing.\n\n431\n00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:24,650\nLet me just fire up my little\nzoom in utility here there\n\n432\n00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,960\nThings that we're used to seeing but\nit is all being rendered in French now.\n\n433\n00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,130\nThe user interface for\n\n434\n00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,890\nWindows is now set to French and if that's\nmy native language this is going to\n\n435\n00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,960\nmake it easier to work with this\ncomputer on a, on a regular basis.\n\n436\n00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,390\nAnd and it it's throughout, right?\n\n437\n00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,160\nNotice the breadcrumb trail,\nthe breadcrumb trail up there.\n\n438\n00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,660\n>> Yep.\n\n439\n00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,490\n>> The the, the page menus.\n\n440\n00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,470\nYou know, the,\nthe navigation on the left side.\n\n441\n00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,990\nAll of it has been\nswitched over to French.\n\n442\n00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,780\nThe entire user interface for Windows.\n\n443\n00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,875\nA lot of applications will see.\n\n444\n00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That I've changed my native language.\n\n445\n00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,930\nAnd the application will change also.\n\n446\n00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,960\n>> Hm.\n\n447\n00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,000\n>> A lot of them won't.\n\n448\n00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600\nSo it just depends on the apps But\n\n449\n00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,062\nif I were to fire up Microsoft Office\n>> Yeah.\n\n450\n00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:02,125\n>> Right now it would\nrecognize this change.\n\n451\n00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:02,730\nI don't have Microsoft Office.\n\n452\n00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,202\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I have OpenOffice on here and\n\n453\n00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:05,860\nI don't think it recognized the change.\n\n454\n00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,740\nBut, but,\nit has it's own language libraries.\n\n455\n00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,910\n>> Right.\n>> And so you can flip and\n\n456\n00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,150\nswitch over to those.\n\n457\n00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,070\nBut it's, it's pretty neat you know,\njust to, to be able to go through and\n\n458\n00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,020\ndo this stuff.\n\n459\n00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,740\nIf I fire up Internet Explorer well,\nI'm on Google's web page,\n\n460\n00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,750\nright but inside of Internet Explorer I\ncan see even these menu items are now.\n\n461\n00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,180\nApparently it's not gonna let\nme zoom in on that, but, but\n\n462\n00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,955\nanyhow these are in French.\n\n463\n00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:34,690\nAnd if I, you know, if I go to a page,\nif I go to like Amazon.com,\n\n464\n00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,820\nwell it's going to see that my IP\naddress is here in the United States and\n\n465\n00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,710\nit's still going to render the US\nto English page that we expect but\n\n466\n00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,320\nif we were going to Amazon.fr.\n\n467\n00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,180\nThen you get your page in French also.\n\n468\n00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,420\nSo you know there's, there's only so\n\n469\n00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,250\nmuch you can do\n>> Right.\n\n470\n00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,110\n>> With the user interface of Windows.\n\n471\n00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,860\nThe apps and\n\n472\n00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,350\nthe webpages themselves well you've\ngot to deal with them independently.\n\n473\n00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,961\nSo, but it's neat, you know,\n\n474\n00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:00,610\nyou don't have a recycle bin anymore,\n>> Right.\n\n475\n00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,260\n>> You know, you have all the, the,\nthe localized names and and so\n\n476\n00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,120\nit's, it's pretty cool and, and they, they\nreally are thorough about it, you know.\n\n477\n00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,470\nInstead of a desktop,\nyou have a bureau and, and so on.\n\n478\n00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,310\nJust trying to make that\nsomething easier to work with.\n\n479\n00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,436\nInstead of Downloads,\nyou have Telechargements.\n\n480\n00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:19,990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> My horrible French.\n\n481\n00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,140\nI, I'm not gonna assault\nanybody with my terrible,\n\n482\n00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,330\nmy terrible pronunciation\n>> Your disque local.\n\n483\n00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,280\nYour discay local?\n>> Yep, it's like a discotheque.\n\n484\n00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,390\n>> Yep.\n>> So, so anyhow, very cool and I,\n\n485\n00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,510\nI picked French just because I'm\nmoderately familiar with it.\n\n486\n00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,430\nBut, you could pick any, any language\nthat's in the support database there.\n\n487\n00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,582\n>> As long as you're familiar with it.\n\n488\n00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:37,094\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n489\n00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,760\n>> Yeah, you get, get out of hand fast.\n\n490\n00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,940\nSo, the other thing you'll,\nworth remembering though,\n\n491\n00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,170\nis that the keyboard\nlayout does change too.\n\n492\n00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,950\nSo always remember that you've got that.\n\n493\n00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,110\nAnd you can easily flip\nbetween them using that,\n\n494\n00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,360\nthat little link at the bottom of\nthe screen that I showed you guys already.\n\n495\n00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,180\n>> Yeah.\n\n496\n00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,130\n>> All right,\n>> Sounds good.\n\n497\n00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,620\n>> Ronnie, can you think of anything\nelse we need to mention on languages?\n\n498\n00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,420\n>> Nope.\nJust kind of remember that a lot of times\n\n499\n00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,340\nwhere you'll see this, like Don mentioned\nhere if you are doing that switch\n\n500\n00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,900\nbetween to help other users out\nin terms of their languages.\n\n501\n00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,010\nIf you are supporting users of different\nlanguages, this is a great support, as\n\n502\n00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,420\nwell, that will actually help them be able\nto find the information that you need.\n\n503\n00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,924\nHopefully that'll never\nhappen over the phone,\n\n504\n00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:15,650\nespecially if you're unfamiliar with\nthe language, but it does happen.\n\n505\n00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:21,310\nSo so again the ability to, to have\na native user use their own language,\n\n506\n00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,200\ngreat benefit and feature for us and very\nsimple to install with just an update.\n\n507\n00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,842\n>> Yeah, excellent.\n\n508\n00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:31,020\nAll right, well that wraps up another\njust one of our one off shows,\n\n509\n00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,870\nour specials that we\ncover the new objectives.\n\n510\n00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,010\nStay tuned, we got more of these\ncoming as we go through and\n\n511\n00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,530\nadd in all the final stuff to\nmake sure that you're ready for\n\n512\n00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:43,176\nthat Windows 8.1 updated exam.\n\n513\n00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:46,560\n>> That's

topic in the show for\nus today.\n\n7\n00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,100\nMy name is Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,680\nI will be your host, and\nhere with the Kung Fu master.\n\n9\n00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,720\n>> Oh man.\n\n10\n00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,515\n>> Nathan Copeland.\n\n11\n00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:54,015\nHow's it going Nate?\n\n12\n00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:54,695\n>> Pretty good, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:56,005\n>> Good.\n>> You know what?\n\n14\n00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,325\n>> What?\n>> This is the first show that you and\n\n15\n00:00:58,325 --> 00:00:59,645\nI have every done together.\n\n16\n00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:00,595\n>> That is true.\n\n17\n00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:04,585\n>> I know, and after, like, all the shows,\nall the stuff that you do and\n\n18\n00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:07,745\nI do, our paths had yet to cross.\n\n19\n00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:08,615\n>> That's true.\n\n20\n00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:09,925\n>> Until today.\n\n21\n00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:15,990\n>> And so, today promises to be at\nleast eventful, to say the least.\n\n22\n00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,330\nAs we begin on this topic here.\n\n23\n00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,290\nNow, what we're actually taking a look at\ndoing here is, because the exam objectives\n\n24\n00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,310\nhave changed since January 2014 here,\nto the Windows 8.1,\n\n25\n00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:34,790\nwe're going back into the Windows Windows\n8 and moving on to Windows 8.1.\n\n26\n00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,490\nAnd so we're going to hit\nthe 70-687 show again and kind\n\n27\n00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,170\nof fill in the gaps where they've added\nin some different exam objectives for us.\n\n28\n00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,250\nAnd some of the ones that they've taken\naway, we're not going to worry about that.\n\n29\n00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,020\nWe're gonna actually just kind of go into\ndetail a little bit more about some of\n\n30\n00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,250\nthe ones that they really\nwant us to focus in on.\n\n31\n00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,840\nAnd so, in that particular sense here\n\n32\n00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,930\nthat will give you kind of a bridging of\nthe shows together that will allow us to\n\n33\n00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,600\nhopefully help you along with the exam\npreparations that you have in place.\n\n34\n00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,260\nAs well.\n\n35\n00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,740\nSo today, we are hitting user profiles,\nnow is not an usual topic for\n\n36\n00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,660\nus, but it is and important topic\nin both the home situation,\n\n37\n00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,410\nas well as the enterprise situation too.\n\n38\n00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,150\nUser profiles are incredibly\nimportant to us\n\n39\n00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,250\nin making sure we understand\nhow they are configured, and\n\n40\n00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,990\nwhy they work the way they do is\nactually and important topic for us.\n\n41\n00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,520\nAs we continue, to move forward here.\n\n42\n00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,940\nSo, if, let me see if I can bring\nup my desktop here for a moment.\n\n43\n00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,740\nOkay.\n\n44\n00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,230\nSo, as you take a look at,\nmy desktop, you actually tay,\n\n45\n00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,750\nsee that here on the,\nshow objectives that we actually have,\n\n46\n00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,510\nwe're underneath this third\ncategory here of the first topic.\n\n47\n00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,630\nThat says migrate and\nconfigure user data, and\n\n48\n00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,620\nwe're gonna start here at, number four.\n\n49\n00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,710\nWhere we talk about configuring local,\nprofiles, and\n\n50\n00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,330\nroaming profiles, and\nthen mandatory profiles.\n\n51\n00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,010\nAnd it's kind of, the mandatory\nprofiles' a little bit strange there.\n\n52\n00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,880\nIf you haven't actually\nseen that one before.\n\n53\n00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,000\nOkay, so we'll also talk about something\nthat's weirder Super mandatory profiles as\n\n54\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,700\nwell as we continue to move on there,\nokay?\n\n55\n00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,130\n>> Now, you know, it's not it's not\ncalled out on the objectives here, but\n\n56\n00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,770\nI believe that we will also touch\ninto the the primary computers.\n\n57\n00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,360\n>> Yes.\n\n58\n00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,640\n>> Now it's, it's not specifically\ncalled out, but it is.\n\n59\n00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,690\nIt is out there\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n60\n00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,970\n>> And I think it, I mean it, it affects\nyour profile and where it can roam a lot.\n\n61\n00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,710\nYou know, primary computers,\n\n62\n00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:39,040\nyou can specify which computers\nyour profile does roam, too.\n\n63\n00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,940\nAnd so we'll turn that on and\nwe'll see profiles Not Rome.\n\n64\n00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,000\n>> Yeah, not Rome to to every\nsingle machine in our domain here.\n\n65\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,890\nNow, I want to put this in context\ncuz this is, this is, I believe,\n\n66\n00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,800\nhow maybe a lot of people at home see\nthe idea of their computer use and\n\n67\n00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,815\nthen let's bring profiles into it.\n\n68\n00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,695\nNow I remember the first time\nthat I got a computer and\n\n69\n00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:02,315\nit was after I got married here,\nand it was simple, right?\n\n70\n00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:04,415\nWe had-\n>> The first time\n\n71\n00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:07,875\n>> the first time, an actual computer,\n\n72\n00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,685\nnot a laptop.\n\n73\n00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,385\nI've had laptops all my life.\n\n74\n00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:17,135\nBut the actual first computer I had, I had\nto share with my wife and so you know,\n\n75\n00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:22,040\nwe'd sign in as one user and She would\nactually add things in that, you know, she\n\n76\n00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,360\nwould use it the same, profile that I was\nusing, and all of a sudden I would go and\n\n77\n00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,295\ntry and look for something that I had\ncreated and I'd find, what, like recipes.\n\n78\n00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:31,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,010\n>> And, you know,\n\n80\n00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,080\nother stuff that she would actually have\nkind of mingled in together with my stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,010\nAnd, after a while it was\nactually kind of difficult for\n\n82\n00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,580\nme to just be able to figure out like,\nso I did what?\n\n83\n00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,160\nI made a subfolder for her, I said look,\nwhen you save stuff, save it in this one.\n\n84\n00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,300\nAnd then when I come back it\nwas never saved in that one.\n\n85\n00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,030\n>> Right.\nSo then you guys also saw each\n\n86\n00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,540\nother's internet browsing history?\n\n87\n00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,310\n>> Yes.\n\n88\n00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:57,810\nSure did.\n\n89\n00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> But that would be.\n\n90\n00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,285\n>> Yeah.\nA little scary for Nathan.\n\n91\n00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:04,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A little scary for Nathan, huh?\n\n92\n00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,020\n>> No, no, no, no.\nI was, I just, I just think about it.\n\n93\n00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,520\nBut, no.\n>> No?\n\n94\n00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,700\n>> I mean, nothing's wrong with the,\n\n95\n00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,110\nyour profile.\n\n96\n00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,987\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In private browsing, it's fine.\n\n97\n00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:11,900\nThat, that works a lot.\n\n98\n00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,430\n>> Yeah.\nNow, that, what.\n\n99\n00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,850\nThe reason why I say that is because\nreally, the recommended method.\n\n100\n00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,950\nOf course, is, according to Microsoft,\nis that everybody keeps their own stuff,\n\n101\n00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,640\nseparated out, and again in a business\nsense we understand why, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,650\nIt's about privacy, okay,\n\n103\n00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,590\nit actually keeps every user separated out\neven if they're sharing the same machine.\n\n104\n00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,700\nIt keeps them from having to search for\nthose things and try saying is that my\n\n105\n00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,910\nfile, or is that Nathan's file that we\nhave?\" But, if you actually do create\n\n106\n00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,070\nindividual user profiles, that means that\nI can sign in and have my own stuff.\n\n107\n00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,830\nMy wife can sign in and\nshe can have her own stuff.\n\n108\n00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,510\nNathan can sign in without having\nto worry about his Internet\n\n109\n00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,541\nbrowser history being explored.\n\n110\n00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,789\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> By someone else.\n\n111\n00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:01,193\n>> Well no, because if you like, shop for\nyour spouse or something, and you know,\n\n112\n00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:02,214\nwhenever they fire up.\n\n113\n00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:04,965\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Well, yeah, so don't fire it up and\n\n114\n00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,027\nthen all the ads are,\n\n115\n00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:10,000\nyou know, targeted towards whatever it\nwas that you were searching to get her.\n\n116\n00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,900\n>> Right. Yeah. >> Or whatever, you know.\n\n117\n00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,110\nSo, it just takes\nthe surprises out of things.\n\n118\n00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,390\n>> Yeah.\nAll right, so, I guess the idea here for\n\n119\n00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,020\nus right at the beginning is to make sure\nwe understand Let's, let's start with idea\n\n120\n00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,655\nof, of what a profile actually is since\nNathan did actually mention it, right?\n\n121\n00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:26,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n122\n00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,000\n>> A profile for\nus is the desktop experience that you and\n\n123\n00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,350\nI have when we log into Windows 8.1.\n\n124\n00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:32,850\nOkay?\n\n125\n00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,710\nAnd that is an environment essentially for\nus, that keeps our settings and\n\n126\n00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,010\nour own files limited to\njust me When I log in, 'kay.\n\n127\n00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,420\nNow, on that local profile itself,\nthis is where we actually kinda start\n\n128\n00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,620\ndifferentiating because we do have to\ntalk about the idea of local profile.\n\n129\n00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,750\nAnd then we'll talk about it in\nthe sense of going to a business and\n\n130\n00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,050\nhow that's a little bit different.\n\n131\n00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,580\nBut local profile is stored\non that laptop itself or\n\n132\n00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,350\non that computer that you're actually on,\n'kay.\n\n133\n00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,710\n>> Now the benefit of that of course is\nthen again unless Nathan's wife can get to\n\n134\n00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:14,410\nhis laptop, no, no, no real need to worry\nabout his internet browsing history.\n\n135\n00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,350\n>> Yeah.\nStrong password.\n\n136\n00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,430\n>> Yeah.\nStrong passwords here, and\n\n137\n00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,900\nthe very fact that Nathan is never let\nhis wife have access to his laptop then,\n\n138\n00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,480\nthen we're okay.\n\n139\n00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,470\n>> Yeah, sort of.\n\n140\n00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,250\n>> Maybe, but the bad thing about it\n\n141\n00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,080\nis that it means all that also that if\nNathan goes to another computer though,\n\n142\n00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,870\nit's going to setup a brand\nnew profile for him.\n\n143\n00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,910\nWhich he'll have to start his\n\n144\n00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,524\ninternet browsing\n\n145\n00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:36,194\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> History all over again.\n\n146\n00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:38,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that may be more of a challenge for\n\n147\n00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,283\nNathan than we realized [LAUGH].\n\n148\n00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:43,300\n[LAUGH] Well yeah, know what, so yeah,\n\n149\n00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,960\na local profile is just local to,\nto one computer.\n\n150\n00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,700\nIt you know it doesn't,\nall your setting just stay right there and\n\n151\n00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,698\nthey don't transfer around anywhere.\n\n152\n00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:54,800\n>> Yeah, of course.\n\n153\n00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,625\n>> I mean the way I've seen it we'll\nget into it a little bit later.\n\n154\n00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,675\n>> Yeah, so that's the idea\nof our local profile for us.\n\n155\n00:08:01,675 --> 00:08:06,559\nNow what Nathan is actually mentioning Is\nthat we're going to also talk about some\n\n156\n00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:09,520\nother special profiles that we can do.\n\n157\n00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,440\nIn another setting where you\nmight use multiple computers,\n\n158\n00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,460\nnot just a single laptop, we may\nactually want to move onto what we call\n\n159\n00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,490\nroaming profiles, and maybe even\npossibly mandatory profiles, as well.\n\n160\n00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,540\nNow, when we describe\nthe differences between those.\n\n161\n00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,360\nA roaming profile allows me to\nactually again take my profile with me\n\n162\n00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,390\nto whatever computer that I'm using.\n\n163\n00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,170\nNow, there are limitations behind that.\n\n164\n00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:39,010\nWe're gonna talk about this idea of, of,\nof a domain in, in just a moment briefly,\n\n165\n00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,680\nbut there are ways that I can\nactually be within a business network\n\n166\n00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,610\nBe able to actually use my laptop and\nalso then, log off my laptop,\n\n167\n00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,270\ngo to another, PC, log in there and\n\n168\n00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,900\nhave the same consistent desktop that I\nwould have had here on my laptop as well.\n\n169\n00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,200\nNow, there's another one, now I don't\nknow if Nate wants to jump in on this,\n\n170\n00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,505\nthe idea of the mandatory profile.\n\n171\n00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:04,090\nMm-hm.\n\n172\n00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,980\nYeah.\n>> All right.\n\n173\n00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,960\n>> Mandatory profile.\n\n174\n00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,940\nYeah.\nWhat what this does is that it creates\n\n175\n00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,152\na like I would say like a,\na read-only profile.\n\n176\n00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:14,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n177\n00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,890\n>> It stores the,\nthe profile up on a, a network share.\n\n178\n00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,220\nAnd every time a user logs in, it pulls\ndown that profile of the network share\n\n179\n00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,435\nand, and builds the,\nI guess that current session.\n\n180\n00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:30,380\n[INAUDIBLE] of, I guess,\nthat user's profile right then and there.\n\n181\n00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,870\nAll the changes are stored locally and\nwhen the guy, ya know,\n\n182\n00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,350\nsigns out the changes are not,\nya know, written back, or\n\n183\n00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,730\nsynced back to that network chair,\nthey're just gone, and they're lost.\n\n184\n00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, that user goes to another\n\n185\n00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,220\ncomputer somewhere else, or even on\nthat same one again later [INAUDIBLE]\n\n186\n00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,150\n>> Logs in, and\n\n187\n00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,940\nit pulls down that same profile again and\nuses it.\n\n188\n00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so,\n\n189\n00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,550\nwe're gonna talk about some of\nthe benefits of using each one of these,\n\n190\n00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,940\ntoo as we continue to move forward.\n\n191\n00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,970\nDo we wanna do a configuration right\nnow or do we wanna talk about what\n\n192\n00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,770\nWhat some of the benefits\nare to our first one and then?\n\n193\n00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,370\n>> We can we can try this stuff out.\n\n194\n00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,820\n>> Okay.\nYeah, so, let's go ahead and\n\n195\n00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,030\ntalk about the idea of\nconfiguring the user profile.\n\n196\n00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,410\nNow, this is not difficult.\n\n197\n00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,805\nIt's nothing that you really have\nto do a lot of setup to actually\n\n198\n00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,780\ndo,but as we begin here,\n\n199\n00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,640\nNathan's gonna actually show us a demo\nof just creating a regular user profile.\n\n200\n00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,250\nOkay?\n\n201\n00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,340\nRemember that this only affects this\nlocal computer and that's the key for\n\n202\n00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,940\nus here,\nthat it only affects that one computer.\n\n203\n00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,610\nAnd we do need these things because\nif we don't keep the actual profiles,\n\n204\n00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,970\nif we only use one profile\nlike we do at my house.\n\n205\n00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,540\nIt's fairly simple.\n\n206\n00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,200\nIf my profile becomes corrupted so\n\n207\n00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,130\ndoes all of those recipes that my wife\nkeeps and she'd be very upset at me.\n\n208\n00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,940\nIf I kept all of my\npictures in one location,\n\n209\n00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,000\nthe same thing would\nactually happen there.\n\n210\n00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,325\nSo, Nathan, why don't you kind of help\nus out here as we go through this.\n\n211\n00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:54,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n212\n00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,820\nAll right, yeah sure.\n\n213\n00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,810\nSo, on air we didn't go down and\ngo into our our PC settings And\n\n214\n00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,920\nover here in two accounts\nwe click into here and\n\n215\n00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,270\nI am signed into a,\nright now I'm using a domain,\n\n216\n00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,970\nan account domain computer, and\nit shows me how I'm signed on right here.\n\n217\n00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,550\nAnd we can choose on other accounts and\n\n218\n00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,420\nthen this is where we have\nthe opportunity to add an account.\n\n219\n00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,760\nWe're going to add it right here.\n\n220\n00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,596\nNow of course, with Microsoft and\nwith Windows 8.1.\n\n221\n00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:30,590\nIt would prefer a Microsoft account\nwhich really is the best way to go.\n\n222\n00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,550\nYou can download stuff from the store, and\n\n223\n00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,280\nsync everything with Sky Drive, and\nyou know, it's really the way to go.\n\n224\n00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,510\nNow, you know, with this we won't go\nthrough and setting up a new one, but\n\n225\n00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,840\ndown here at the bottom, sign in\nwithout a Microsoft account, they say,\n\n226\n00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,470\nnot recommended, and then it gives us\nanother option, like are you sure?\n\n227\n00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,520\nYou get all this really cool stuff.\n\n228\n00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,790\nSo we will just choose a local account.\n\n229\n00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,530\n>> Yeah.\nCan you go back\n\n230\n00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,200\njust for a-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n231\n00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,920\n>> Moment here.\n\n232\n00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,850\nNathan.\nAnd\n\n233\n00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,500\nlet's make sure that we understand here.\n\n234\n00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,980\nNotice the differences between using\na Microsoft account and a local account.\n\n235\n00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,180\nThis is relatively important for us.\n\n236\n00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,600\nEspecially if you're going\nto require users to go and\n\n237\n00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,540\nretrieve apps from the Window's store.\n\n238\n00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,110\nOkay?\n\n239\n00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,990\nIf they sign in with local account\nthey won't have access to that.\n\n240\n00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,000\nOkay?\nAs well.\n\n241\n00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,710\nAnd notice they actually show\nunderneath local account and\n\n242\n00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,090\nyou have to create a username.\n\n243\n00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,580\nAnd account for each PC that you use.\n\n244\n00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,170\nYou'll need to actually use a Microsoft\naccount if you wanna do that.\n\n245\n00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,790\nYour settings will not be synched\nacross that PC you use as well.\n\n246\n00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,700\nYou might be saying,\nwell I don't need that.\n\n247\n00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,420\nWell, if you don't need that,\nperfectly fine for yes,\n\n248\n00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,230\nyou created a local user account.\n\n249\n00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,530\nBut if any one of those\nare requirements that you need,\n\n250\n00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,870\nyou need to consider creating\na Microsoft account.\n\n251\n00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,988\nSo, it's important for\nus to actually remember that.\n\n252\n00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:45,643\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n253\n00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:46,298\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n254\n00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,580\n>> All right then.\n\n255\n00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,025\nYeah, let's click on Local Account here\nand we'll give it a we'll just call this\n\n256\n00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:55,430\nNew.user and.\n\n257\n00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,805\nWell actually, I'm gonna change that.\n\n258\n00:12:58,805 --> 00:13:01,320\n>> [LAUGH]\nOh, no.\n\n259\n00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,230\nIt might mean his super secret password.\n\n260\n00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,840\n>> Yup.\n\n261\n00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,910\nLet me.\nNo, I'm not gonna click it.\n\n262\n00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,032\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:07,532\n>> All right.\n\n264\n00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:10,797\nAll right.\n\n265\n00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:13,610\nSo, we give it a a user name and\na password.\n\n266\n00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,970\nWe'll click on next here.\n\n267\n00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,470\nAnd then, that's it, right?\n\n268\n00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,430\n>> Yep.\n\n269\n00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,200\n>> New user account is created.\n\n270\n00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,980\nWe'll click on finish, and,\nand there that guy is.\n\n271\n00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,050\nAnd so, now, we, you know,\nwe can log off on our current profile, and\n\n272\n00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,200\nthen on, on the Windows,\nscreen there, we can.\n\n273\n00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,790\nType in local dot user and\nwith the password and\n\n274\n00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,510\nwhen the guy fires up it\nwill create that account.\n\n275\n00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,290\n>> Yeah, now don't forget at this\npoint too that before you can create\n\n276\n00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,700\na local user account you also\nmust be signed on with an account\n\n277\n00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,920\nthat will give you administrative\nprivileges to create one,\n\n278\n00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,520\nif you don't have those administrative\nprivileges to create an account\n\n279\n00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,920\nyou won't be able to do this, so\nmake sure you sign on with that.\n\n280\n00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,060\n>> Now that I've created the account, Nate\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n281\n00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,020\n>> How do I generate my\nown desktop at this point?\n\n282\n00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,395\n'Kay, let's talk about what it does, okay?\n\n283\n00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When we sign on here.\n\n284\n00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,069\n'Kay.\n\n285\n00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:06,129\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n286\n00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:09,445\nSo oh, oh, like with the new user?\n\n287\n00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:10,365\n>> Yeah, with the new user.\n\n288\n00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:15,805\n>> Oh yeah, you just have to log in,\nsign in, and when it signs in,\n\n289\n00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:20,105\nit yeah, it builds everything up and\nit builds that profile, and\n\n290\n00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:25,015\nyou know, there's a default\nprofile that it uses as a base and\n\n291\n00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:29,915\nit, yeah, every user gets its own,\nit's own profile and a matter of fact\n\n292\n00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,350\n>> Let me get back to the desktop here.\n\n293\n00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,550\nSo yeah, every user gets his own\nprofile and in the users folder.\n\n294\n00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,970\nAnd so here we go.\n\n295\n00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,320\nWe've got our,\neveryone has their own little profile.\n\n296\n00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,670\nSo I'm signed in as well.\n\n297\n00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,030\nI kind of worked my profile for\nthis guy right here currently, If i\n\n298\n00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,900\ntried to go in to Jay's account,\nall right, it wont let me.\n\n299\n00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,290\nNow, I am an administrator\non this machine,\n\n300\n00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,820\nyou know, I can add myself to it's\nsecurity list and get in there.\n\n301\n00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,430\nBut yeah, so for regular users,\nthey can't browse in each other's profile,\n\n302\n00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,860\nit does lock it down, and\neverybody gets their own.\n\n303\n00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,530\nI think I hijacked Mike's earlier,\nI did [laughing] and\n\n304\n00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,970\nwe can see these are Mike's folders.\n\n305\n00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:25,220\nSo his downloads, and links, musics,\nthe videos and his documents.\n\n306\n00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,350\nNo, nothing in documents.\n\n307\n00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,430\n>> Yeah.\n>> But let's just check his pictures.\n\n308\n00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,011\n>> Oh, noth, nothing in there, I had to.\n\n309\n00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:33,220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Notice the other folder that is\n\n310\n00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,870\nactually creates in here which is\nthe desktop setting for us as well.\n\n311\n00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,331\nAnd so this is where Mike were\nto sign in the computer and\n\n312\n00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:42,649\nhe were to adjust things on his desktop\n[INAUDIBLE] They would appear in this\n\n313\n00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,130\nfolder when he creates documents,\nthey appear here.\n\n314\n00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:50,329\nNow, Nathan just created a User Account\nbut notice that there is nothing there\n\n315\n00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:55,385\nfor, what'd you call, new.user is\nthe user that Nate just created.\n\n316\n00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:56,585\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n317\n00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:59,287\n>> When Nate actually does\ntake that User Account now and\n\n318\n00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:02,840\nsign in with it It's gonna essentially\ngenerate this ame structure.\n\n319\n00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,598\nNow, for those of you that\nkind of remember like XP,\n\n320\n00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,815\nthis is going a little bit back in\nhistory you may not remember it but\n\n321\n00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:12,900\nWindows XP used to store it in\na place called documents and settings.\n\n322\n00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,270\nReally beginning with Vista and going all\nthe way through Windows 8.1, is C:Users.\n\n323\n00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,750\nAnd that's where all the user profiles are\nnormally stored on a local user profile.\n\n324\n00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,360\nOkay?\n\n325\n00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, so.\n\n326\n00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,120\nLet's, see if we can generate a profile.\n\n327\n00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,000\n>> Yeah,\nyou want me to sign in as that guy?\n\n328\n00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,330\n>> Sure, or sign in as someone else.\n\n329\n00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,510\nAll right.\n>> Now, now, let's sign in as that guy.\n\n330\n00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,310\n>> All right.\nLet me disconnect this off real quick, so\n\n331\n00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,591\nI don't have to mess any of that\nother stuff up, and we will\n\n332\n00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:50,046\ngo the long way.\n\n333\n00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:50,546\nHm,\n\n334\n00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:00,820\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,780\nOh, the camera is on me.\n\n336\n00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,726\nAll right this guy is-\n\n337\n00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:15,910\n[SOUND] I'm trying to\nremember what is cl two and\n\n338\n00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:21,718\nit was new dot user, okay,\nso don't press enter yet.\n\n339\n00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:26,333\nSo for us here, notice what Nathan did,\nwe're using a remote desktop connection,\n\n340\n00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,110\nwhich means the machine is not\nreally right here in front of us.\n\n341\n00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,430\nWe're actually using another machine\nviewing the remote desktop connection for\n\n342\n00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,740\nus and what he did there was is he\nput in what we would call a pre\n\n343\n00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,210\nwindows two thousand entry there.\n\n344\n00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,200\nBut notice he didn't sign in as\nthe domain user, which is the network.\n\n345\n00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,270\nHe actually selected his machine,\nhis machine.\n\n346\n00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,430\nWhat is that, CKBOW?\n\n347\n00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,600\nIs that what it is?\n\n348\n00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,360\n>> Yeah, CKBW.\n\n349\n00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,506\n>> Yeah, CKBW, see, I can't even see that.\n\n350\n00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Shows you what I know.\n\n351\n00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,770\nIt's dash CL2, and\nthen backslash and do that.\n\n352\n00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:02,430\nAnd that means he's gonna use that local\ncomputer's username and password database,\n\n353\n00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,910\nokay, is what he's actually using\nthere to confirm these credentials.\n\n354\n00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,950\nOkay and then he typed in the password.\n\n355\n00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,840\nAnd notice underneath domain it\nverifies that and now he's ready to go.\n\n356\n00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,550\n>> Alright.\n[COUGH]\n\n357\n00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,880\nAlright so far so good and\n\n358\n00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,555\nwe'll just click on that and\nhopefully it Okay we'll connect.\n\n359\n00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,615\n>> Oh,\nhe's not part of the remote users group.\n\n360\n00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,275\n>> All right.\n\n361\n00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,475\nLet, I can change it real quick.\n\n362\n00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,305\n>> So sometimes this happens, right?\n\n363\n00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:31,505\nEspecially on a remote user.\n\n364\n00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:33,445\nIf you're gonna do this remotely,\n\n365\n00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,555\nyou do actually have to be a member of the\nremote users group to be able to sign in.\n\n366\n00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,458\nYeah, so\nNathan can simply change that for us.\n\n367\n00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:48,667\nWhoops,\n\n368\n00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:55,180\nwrong one.\n\n369\n00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,720\nAll right, I'm just gonna add\nthis guy to the admins group.\n\n370\n00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,540\n>> There you go.\n\n371\n00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,360\n>> Right, quick, that should clear it up.\n\n372\n00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,391\nNew dot user its this guy.\n\n373\n00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,473\n>> Might have to do administrator.\n\n374\n00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:23,831\nOr that.\n\n375\n00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,780\n>> Now it doesn't,\nyou really just figure it out.\n\n376\n00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,920\n>> No, no not exactly, ya.\n\n377\n00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,830\nYou know, close enough is not.\n\n378\n00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,900\n>> All right let me just click on it.\n\n379\n00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,820\nOkay.\n>> There we go, let's try it now.\n\n380\n00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,480\n>> All right we're good,\nwe're good, we're good there.\n\n381\n00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,600\nAnd I'll just disconnect form that guy.\n\n382\n00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,170\nAll right.\n\n383\n00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:55,920\nAnd we'll connect again.\n\n384\n00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,637\n>> Oh, kicked you in as Nathan right away.\n\n385\n00:19:58,637 --> 00:19:59,855\n>> Alright, [SOUND].\n\n386\n00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:02,721\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n387\n00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:03,291\nYeah.\n\n388\n00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:09,780\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n389\n00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,710\nYeah, all right.\n\n390\n00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,610\n>> No, that's fine.\n\n391\n00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,980\nYou know, as the, as the local user\naccount, right, what we should see\n\n392\n00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,960\nafter he does sign in if we can ever get\nNathan to, to be able to sign in here.\n\n393\n00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,300\nIt, it we should end up seeing that if we\ngo back to that same location the C users\n\n394\n00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,620\nA, a folder and then a subfolder\nstructure created for that user.\n\n395\n00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,580\nThat way every time that the user\ndoes modify or create anything it\n\n396\n00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,050\nit joins it and it stores right there\nin that particular user profile.\n\n397\n00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,040\nAnd that's important, again,\nbecause remember if we don't\n\n398\n00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,650\nStuff again can now get mixed up and\nagain we don't want that to happen so\n\n399\n00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,980\nthe use of a profile is\nactually relevant to everybody.\n\n400\n00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,220\n>> Here we go.\nYay, I did it.\n\n401\n00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,770\n>> Yeah, now at the beginning it takes\na little bit of time because well don;t\n\n402\n00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,960\nhave any of that structure\n>> Built up.\n\n403\n00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,950\nRight?\nSo.\n\n404\n00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,220\nthe first time it's got\nto generate everything.\n\n405\n00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,130\nAnd a lot of times when you actually\nare doing this for the first time.\n\n406\n00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,010\nYou sign it.\nYou get this little, at least.\n\n407\n00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,800\nIn Windows 8 you used to get\nthis little preview screen.\n\n408\n00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,555\nRight?\nAll right, so\n\n409\n00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:15,515\nthen just let you sit here and watch\nthe little what, what do you call that?\n\n410\n00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:18,425\nCircle of falling dots or\nwhatever you wanna call it here.\n\n411\n00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,605\n>> Oh, that's good.\nI'm gonna use that now.\n\n412\n00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:22,155\n>> Yeah.\nTo, to do this, right?\n\n413\n00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,945\nIt used to kinda give you this\nwelcome screen that said,\n\n414\n00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:28,015\nthis is how you use your PC and\nyou have to click here on the corners.\n\n415\n00:21:28,015 --> 00:21:30,835\nAnd you, you kinda did that so\nyou weren't just stand, you know,\n\n416\n00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,565\nwondering if something had gone wrong.\n\n417\n00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:34,260\nNothing's really going wrong here.\n\n418\n00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,720\nIt just has to again now generate\nthat folder structure, and\n\n419\n00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,750\nnow have to redirect all of the stuff\nthat you're gonna do, into those folders.\n\n420\n00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,110\nYep.\n\n421\n00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,440\n>> Yeah, it's just gonna kind of\ngrind away here at the moment.\n\n422\n00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,950\nI suppose.\n\n423\n00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,850\nAnd build up that profile.\n\n424\n00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,300\n>> Now while it's actually building\nup that picker profile, okay.\n\n425\n00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,270\nIs there any disadvantage to\nusing just a local user profile\n\n426\n00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,780\nif you actually have\nmore than one computer?\n\n427\n00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,490\nNate?\n>> Sort of.\n\n428\n00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,578\n>> Yeah?\n>> I suppose.\n\n429\n00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:08,630\nI guess it It kind of\ndepends on what you're after.\n\n430\n00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,135\n[CROSSTALK] So at my house, right.\n\n431\n00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:13,375\nWe have a handful of computers there.\n\n432\n00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:18,410\nAnd if I want to sign on to,\nlet's say, the kitchen computer.\n\n433\n00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,280\nI had to create a my own little user\nprofile on that kitchen computer\n\n434\n00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,730\nthat I sign in as, and\n\n435\n00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,320\nanything I do on that computer is\nlocked down on that one machine.\n\n436\n00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,330\nIf I you know, come to my laptop here or\n\n437\n00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,570\nthe desktop in the office,\nand sign on over there.\n\n438\n00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:41,190\nYou know, all those settings, files, the\ndownloads, the, internet browsing history,\n\n439\n00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,630\neverything stays, locally on that,\non that one machine.\n\n440\n00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,750\nNow, you know I, I, I guess it's not,\nyou know I kind of get around.\n\n441\n00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,860\nIt's not too bad\n>> Um-hm.\n\n442\n00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,520\n>> But, but yeah, I-I suppose.\n\n443\n00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,670\nIn the business environment,\n\n444\n00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:00,020\nI think that would be pretty bad if\nusers were roaming between machines.\n\n445\n00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,270\nIt can be, I don't know, something.\n\n446\n00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,820\n>> Yeah.\n\n447\n00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,450\nAll right so this is the first time\nthat the new user has now logged in, and\n\n448\n00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,650\nwe're gonna check his profile space here.\n\n449\n00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,259\n>> All right semicolon users.\n\n450\n00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,310\nAll right, and there we go.\n\n451\n00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,420\nSo, new.user, I now have a folder here and\n\n452\n00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,950\nwe click on this guy and\nsure enough there's all, all my stuff.\n\n453\n00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,860\nSo, let's just create a a new\ndocument we'll just call\n\n454\n00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,770\nGame codes, right, inside, you know?\n\n455\n00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,750\nYou got to have those, those game codes.\n\n456\n00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,520\nSo, now, we'll go into my desktop folder,\nand sure enough, game codes, so\n\n457\n00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,475\nthat yup, my, my profile.\n\n458\n00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:42,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n459\n00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,090\nYup.\nSo\n\n460\n00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,940\nremember that this will only\neffect that one profile.\n\n461\n00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,790\nSo, if Nate does create\nshortcuts to other places like.\n\n462\n00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,420\nHis hard drive or\nmaybe even to a shared location.\n\n463\n00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,271\nIt will be stored for him, but not for\neverybody else, even though he's on\n\n464\n00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:59,960\nthe same machine or he uses the same\nmachine with other users here.\n\n465\n00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,960\nSo, Nate, if I don't know if\nyou want to try this or not.\n\n466\n00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,244\nWe'll log off again, log on as you and-\nSo, you have the game code show up here,\n\n467\n00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:11,140\nlet's verify that that we have\ncreated the profile correctly.\n\n468\n00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,365\n>> Mm. Yup. [LAUGH] I think I got it now.\n\n469\n00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:19,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so we'll just connect that\n\n470\n00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:25,420\nway, and then we'll just go,\n>> We'll just go with the, yeah.\n\n471\n00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,840\nJust this quick way, and so, you know,\n\n472\n00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,440\nthis is signing in to the, domain account\nthat we'll using for the roaming profiles.\n\n473\n00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n474\n00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,360\n>> That good stuff.\n\n475\n00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,540\nAnd, oh yeah, that's right.\n\n476\n00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,530\nYeah, and I, I did, I, yeah, I did.\n\n477\n00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,270\n>> Oh, I forgot your, yeah,\nyour temporary profile.\n\n478\n00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,180\n>> I did something to this thing.\n\n479\n00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,430\nI don't know, you know, I.\n\n480\n00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,630\nSo, you know, so this weekend I was\nsetting up with, with roaming profiles and\n\n481\n00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,010\nwith primary computers, and so,\non this one, you know, maybe I,\n\n482\n00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,720\nI left that policy buried\nin there somewhere.\n\n483\n00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,250\n>> Yeah.\n\n484\n00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,560\n>> But I, I, I turned on so\n\n485\n00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,700\nthat this, this client too\n>> Right.\n\n486\n00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,750\n>> It would not take my profile in there,\nand I'm pretty sure I turned it off.\n\n487\n00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,890\nBut every time when I login to this thing,\nit generates a new profile and\n\n488\n00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,660\nthen it, it'll will pop up\na little window saying you know,\n\n489\n00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,942\nyou signed in with a temporary profile or\n>> Yeah\n\n490\n00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,590\n>> All right go to c,\n\n491\n00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,876\ncolon users\n>> Actually I don't really.\n\n492\n00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:18,760\n>> Just on your actual\ndesktop right there.\n\n493\n00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,270\nWe don't have the actual\ngame codes list there.\n\n494\n00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,540\nWhich again, shows that we have not\naffected anybody else's user profiles.\n\n495\n00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,950\nAgain, the advantage is here keeping\npeople's stuff separated out.\n\n496\n00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,350\nIf Nathan, just like he did,\nwhere he talked about his bigger profile,\n\n497\n00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,900\nhas now,\n>> Essentially kind of something's wrong\n\n498\n00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,940\nwith it where you can't actually log\ninto the permanent profile here.\n\n499\n00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,470\nIt generates a temporary one, but it\nshould not effect the new user or Jay, or\n\n500\n00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,540\nMike, or whoever else is actually signed\nin on this particular machine It actually\n\n501\n00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,640\nworks fairly well for\nus to keep all that separated out and\n\n502\n00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,170\nI guarantee you that you're\ngoing to actually want to do\n\n503\n00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,150\nthis especially if you have\nstuff like Nate's talking about.\n\n504\n00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,947\n>> Whoa, wait what are you talking about?\n\n505\n00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:06,780\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> Man you're bad.\n\n506\n00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,290\nYou're terrible.\n\n507\n00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,790\nAll right so I, we [LAUGH] we've\ngot Arcia, brand new profile.\n\n508\n00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,360\nThere we go.\n\n509\n00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,610\nThat's as much as we get\nconfiguring the guy, right?\n\n510\n00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,700\n>> Yeah, remember that you,\n\n511\n00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,880\nyou still do have some issues here\nwith the local profile as well.\n\n512\n00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,680\nRight?\n\n513\n00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,810\nYou don't get to go to another machine and\n\n514\n00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:28,210\nexpect your stuff to pop up on the desktop\nif you're only using it in local profiles.\n\n515\n00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,580\nAt home again, probably not so\nbig and important but\n\n516\n00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,150\nwhen we get into our next section, which\nwe'll take a look at after our break here\n\n517\n00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,320\nWe're going to talk about profiles that\nreally do help you in an environment\n\n518\n00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,760\nwhere there is business and you are\nactually moving between multiple machines.\n\n519\n00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,300\nAnd so, we'll talk about\nthe idea of roaming profiles and\n\n520\n00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,740\nmandatory profiles as well.\n\n521\n00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,240\n>> You know what, before we go,\nwe only have a few minutes left.\n\n522\n00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,980\nWe won't quite get, let's just.\n\n523\n00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,330\nTalking about the roaming profiles and\n\n524\n00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,440\nthen when we come back,\nwe can just jump right into it.\n\n525\n00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,160\n>> Sure!\nOkay.\n\n526\n00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,938\n>> And and start.\n\n527\n00:26:57,938 --> 00:27:04,570\nNow, roaming profiles, what it is, is that\nthe profile is stored on a network share.\n\n528\n00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,980\nAnd every time the user logs in,\n\n529\n00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,950\nit downloads that user profile\nto that local machine.\n\n530\n00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,100\nThe user makes all his changes and\ndoes whatever he wants to it,\n\n531\n00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,350\nmaybe throws files on the desktop And\nwhen that user signs off,\n\n532\n00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,050\nthen those changes are synced\nback to that network chair.\n\n533\n00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,490\nThe next time the user signs in,\n\n534\n00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,580\nthe changes then are, are pulled down,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n535\n00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,790\n>> And, and uses it.\n\n536\n00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,735\nNow, When the user signs out\nthat profile stays there.\n\n537\n00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,800\n>> Um-hm.\n>> So, if this user is, you know,\n\n538\n00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,280\nroaming in-between,\nyou know, ten computers,\n\n539\n00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,385\nall ten of those computers will have\na local copy of his user profile.\n\n540\n00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:41,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n541\n00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,105\n>> Let's say if it's a, administrator or,\nsomeone from marketing.\n\n542\n00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:48,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And as a, you know, spread sheets or,\n\n543\n00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,030\nyou know, financial information saved in,\n\n544\n00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,980\nin the user's profile\n>> It will be stored.\n\n545\n00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,230\n>> Right.\n>> On, on all those, all those machines.\n\n546\n00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,780\nIt may not be ideal if there is you know,\n\n547\n00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,230\nsensitive information in there you\nmay not want it lingering out there.\n\n548\n00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,730\nWe can use primary computers to prevent\nstuff like that and, and block it out.\n\n549\n00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,070\nNow if you have a bunch of users,\nlet's say you've got what, what's a bunch?\n\n550\n00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,990\n100?\n\n551\n00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,510\n>> About that.\n>> 100 people.\n\n552\n00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,050\n>> You have 100 users and they all get\nto work Monday morning, you know, what,\n\n553\n00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,270\nwhat time do people start work?\n\n554\n00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,278\n>> I would say 8:00.\n\n555\n00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:21,314\n>> 10:00?\n10:00 a.m.?\n\n556\n00:28:21,314 --> 00:28:21,833\n8:00?\nDang.\n\n557\n00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,450\nThat's\n>> That's about an hour and\n\n558\n00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,740\na half after you wake up.\n\n559\n00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,160\n>> Oh.\nThat, that is early.\n\n560\n00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,780\n>> I know.\n\n561\n00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,500\n>> That, that quick?\n\n562\n00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> Man.\n\n563\n00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,540\nSo, all these people start at\nthe ugly hour of 8:00 in the morning.\n\n564\n00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,890\n>> And, and they get up before\n>> Before that Nate,\n\n565\n00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,520\nthey actually even get up before than.\n\n566\n00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,010\n>> That's, that's\n>> Because they start work at eight.\n\n567\n00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,965\n>> It's probably dark.\n\n568\n00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:43,730\n[LAUGH] It's probably dark that early,\nOkay, I'm just kidding.\n\n569\n00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,860\n>> It could be so those end users,\nthey get to work,\n\n570\n00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,080\nthey all sign in\n>> And all of them are gonna be\n\n571\n00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,910\npulling down their profile right\nthere when they all sign in.\n\n572\n00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,070\nNow depending on, you know,\nI guess network limitations,\n\n573\n00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,350\nit could really, slow things down.\n\n574\n00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,420\nIt, I guess, you know, just for\nbringing down, down their profiles.\n\n575\n00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,270\nIt was the first time, yes.\n\n576\n00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,855\n>> It could take a little bit\nsigning in and that sort of thing.\n\n577\n00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:13,980\nYeahm the other thing is you\nknow if they save large files,\n\n578\n00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,750\nmovies, presentations, music,\nall those are going to be synced.\n\n579\n00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,890\nThey're going to be transferred back and\nforth.\n\n580\n00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:21,610\nA lot of crossing over.\n\n581\n00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,980\n>> You keep going to this\nidea of movies and pictures.\n\n582\n00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,800\nWhat's going on there?\n\n583\n00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,940\n>> What else do you stick in your profile?\n\n584\n00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,810\nFiles, work documents.\n\n585\n00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,220\n>> Well, like, like text documents?\n\n586\n00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,850\n>> Yes. Yes, I do. >> Well.\n\n587\n00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,130\n>> I know.\n\n588\n00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,790\nI'm boring.\n\n589\n00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,310\n>> Mm.\n\n590\n00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,480\nWell how, how big is your user profile?\n\n591\n00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,300\n>> It's kind of relatively big.\n\n592\n00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,590\n>> Well what's, what's so big in there?\n\n593\n00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,005\n>> Well other things\nlike virtual machines,\n\n594\n00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:48,105\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well\n\n595\n00:29:48,105 --> 00:29:50,500\n>> [LAUGH] All right, bad example.\n\n596\n00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:55,510\nWell yeah, and that's roaming profiles.\n\n597\n00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,970\nWe'll we'll probably do\na summary as we come back and\n\n598\n00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,120\nthen we'll get into the idea\nof configuring this.\n\n599\n00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,092\nBut as of right now for\nthe segment on local profiles,\n\n600\n00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,812\nanything else that we can\nthink about having in?\n\n601\n00:30:05,812 --> 00:30:08,040\n>> Uh-huh, I think we're all right.\n\n602\n00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,855\nSounds good, so we're gonna take a quick\nbreak and we'll be right back after this.\n\n603\n00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:16,361\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n604\n00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:21,772\nwelcome back.\n\n605\n00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:24,985\nTo our next segment here,\nas we continue on.\n\n606\n00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:27,185\nWe had just finished that first segment.\n\n607\n00:30:27,185 --> 00:30:29,576\nTalking about the What\nwere we talking about?\n\n608\n00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:30,406\n>> Roaming profiles.\n\n609\n00:30:30,406 --> 00:30:31,265\n>> Roaming profiles.\n\n610\n00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:32,285\nYeah, we were talking,\n\n611\n00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:36,055\nwe were just introducing the topic\nof roaming profiles for us.\n\n612\n00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:42,340\nAnd at home, you may not choose to\nset up a roaming profile very often.\n\n613\n00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,640\nYou could if you wanted to,\nbut in a business though,\n\n614\n00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,900\nthis is a very important concept for us.\n\n615\n00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,140\nLike I said, especially if you actually\nare going to be using, let's say,\n\n616\n00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,825\na laptop as you are are roaming\naround the office and yes,\n\n617\n00:30:56,825 --> 00:31:01,435\nyou have a regular desktop PC\nsitting in your office somewhere and\n\n618\n00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:04,185\nyou need to go get access\nto those files quickly.\n\n619\n00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:08,675\nA roaming profile helps us to\nkeep a consistent user desktop\n\n620\n00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:12,595\nbetween both of those machines\nbecause what happens here\n\n621\n00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:17,870\nis that it actually does take that profile\nand it stores it up somewhere else.\n\n622\n00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,450\nYou go and you log off of one machine.\n\n623\n00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,360\nIt saves that information up on\nwhat we call a network share and\n\n624\n00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,330\nthen when you go an login somewhere\nelse.It also pulls a copy of that profile\n\n625\n00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,280\nback down on that computer.\n\n626\n00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,170\nNow just like what Nathan was saying\nbefore we went to our break here,\n\n627\n00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,130\nevery computer that you sign into though.\n\n628\n00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,960\nAnother copy of that profile is\ndownloaded, so you actually to 15 or\n\n629\n00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,880\ndifferent 20 computers, profile will be\ncopied locally back down on that computer,\n\n630\n00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,790\nand that can generate\nmultiple copies of stuff.\n\n631\n00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,090\nAnd, that, you may not want actually\non every single computer out there.\n\n632\n00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:01,175\nOkay, so for us here, it helps\nprovide a very consistent user desktop\n\n633\n00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:06,330\nAllows us to be able to ensure\nthat our files are, are.\n\n634\n00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,930\nWe talked about the idea\nof copying this stuff, but\n\n635\n00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:16,520\nif I make a change on one computer,\nokay, and then I log off Well,\n\n636\n00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,755\nhow does it affect all the other computers\nif I log back into another one then?\n\n637\n00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:21,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n638\n00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,830\n>> If I change a file on one computer if\nI'm logged with a roaming profile okay?\n\n639\n00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,500\n>> Yes.\n\n640\n00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,510\n>> And then I log off of this computer and\nthen I go to my desktop computer, how,\n\n641\n00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,890\nhow does it change,\nend up propagating over there?\n\n642\n00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,510\nOr when you sign out, it syncs your\nprofile back up to the network share.\n\n643\n00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,460\nAnd then when you log into the other\nmachine, it will sync your profile and\n\n644\n00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,490\nit will pull down the change\nthat you made and\n\n645\n00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,020\nput it back on the computer\nyou are now on.\n\n646\n00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,220\n>> Okay, so.\n\n647\n00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,855\n>> Was that the right answer?\n\n648\n00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:55,260\n>> I believe it is.\nYeah, I believe it is okay.\n\n649\n00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,520\nSo, that's the key right.\n\n650\n00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,850\nThat we can actually have that.\n\n651\n00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,910\nHappen for us where I'm not creating\ntwo copies of the same thing and\n\n652\n00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:07,220\nthen wondering which one you know,\ngets the actual change here.\n\n653\n00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,700\nAnd then whichever one was last changed is\nthe one is is actually where we end up.\n\n654\n00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,350\n>> Now let's say that you're\nsigned on to two computers\n\n655\n00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,980\n>> At the same time?\n\n656\n00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,520\n>> At the same time.\n\n657\n00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,410\n>> Same time.\n>> Cuz he just, like, walked out and left,\n\n658\n00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,210\nand you make a change on one computer,\nand you go to the other com,\n\n659\n00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,615\nlet's say you're working on a document.\n\n660\n00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:24,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n661\n00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,370\n>> And you get up, you walk away, and\nyou sign on to another computer and\n\n662\n00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,310\nyou start working on that same document.\n\n663\n00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,650\nYou save your changes and\nthen you log off.\n\n664\n00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,630\nYou go back to the computer that you\nwere working on in the morning, and\n\n665\n00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,030\nthen sign out of that one.\n\n666\n00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,600\nWhat do you think happens?\n\n667\n00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,560\n>> I don't have a clue.\n\n668\n00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,710\n>> It will, yeah, it'll overwrite.\n\n669\n00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,450\n>> Right.\nRight.\n\n670\n00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,250\n>> It'll sync it, it'll sync it back, and\n\n671\n00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,350\nthen the change in the other\ncomputer will be overwritten.\n\n672\n00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n673\n00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,620\n>> So, it's the last one saved, right,\nis the key here for us understanding\n\n674\n00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,580\nwhich file is gonna take precedence\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n675\n00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,220\n>> Over that.\n\n676\n00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,730\nSo, it's not necessarily the last change\nthat was made, it was the last one that\n\n677\n00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,110\nactually got synced up or saved-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n678\n00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,620\n>> Is the one that we actually do,\ndo have to worry about.\n\n679\n00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,720\n>> Yeah, you know, and\na, a big thing, right?\n\n680\n00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,280\nSo, with with roaming profiles,\n\n681\n00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,200\nand having your profile stored Network\nshare is for backup reasons, you know.\n\n682\n00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,610\nSo the administrator,\n\n683\n00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,120\nif they run backups on those user profiles\nthat you know it's central location,\n\n684\n00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,605\neverything's saved there, it's all backed\nup right there Yeah, and there you go.\n\n685\n00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:26,975\nSo, they don't have to worry about backing\nup individual computers and first.\n\n686\n00:34:26,975 --> 00:34:29,695\nOf course businesses that\ndo backup individual PC's.\n\n687\n00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:34,144\nI guess if you save it locally then it's,\nit's just gone, right?\n\n688\n00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:35,304\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n689\n00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:35,851\nMhm.\n\n690\n00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:39,216\nSo, administratively, though,\nwe, we talked about the idea of,\n\n691\n00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:42,432\nespecially in Microsoft,\nof least administrative effort.\n\n692\n00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:43,252\nRight?\n\n693\n00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:45,302\nWhen we start managing\nMicrosoft computers,\n\n694\n00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:47,212\nespecially that Windows 8.1 here.\n\n695\n00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,522\nThat, the roaming profile really does\nhelp us because of what we mentioned.\n\n696\n00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:51,132\nRight?\n\n697\n00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:54,182\nVery fact is when we're backing up really\none machine at this point that has\n\n698\n00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:55,932\neverybody's user profile.\n\n699\n00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:59,100\nAnd if I don't have some of my roaming\nprofiles here, we have to go to each and\n\n700\n00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,750\nevery users individual computer, and\nensure that backups do happen when we,\n\n701\n00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,005\nwhen we configure this.\n\n702\n00:35:05,005 --> 00:35:05,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n703\n00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,360\n>> Yup.\n>> All right.\n\n704\n00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:12,330\nSweet, now there are, there are some\nfolders, though, that are never synced up.\n\n705\n00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,790\n>> Right.\n>> E even if you\n\n706\n00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,620\nroaming profiles are turned on\n>> There are some that they just\n\n707\n00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,410\ndon't go up.\n\n708\n00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,070\nAnd Ryan, correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut temporary internet files,\n\n709\n00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,160\nthank goodness, right?\n\n710\n00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,910\nThose are never synced and\n\n711\n00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:31,150\nthe app data, the app data folder\nthat is never synced across.\n\n712\n00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:36,680\nSo we've just got files and documents and\nuser settings, but not that stuff.\n\n713\n00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,830\n>> Yeah, the app data local folder\nis the one that is never synced up.\n\n714\n00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,270\nAnd that's because when you actually\ngo into app data, that local folder\n\n715\n00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:48,230\nonly changes that effect that particular\nusers profile on that computer\n\n716\n00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,360\nare normally what's going on there right\nat the point when you're logged in.\n\n717\n00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,800\n>> So,\nit doesn't really affect anything else.\n\n718\n00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,410\nSo, if you go to another computer,\n\n719\n00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,075\nthat ticker loave a local folder as\nthe one that you actually do have.\n\n720\n00:35:59,075 --> 00:35:59,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n721\n00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,925\n>> That, that that is not gonna\never be copied back up there.\n\n722\n00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:04,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n723\n00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,610\n>> Sweet.\n\n724\n00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,340\nWell, Ronnie\n\n725\n00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,340\nwhy don't you say we get into this guy-\n>> All right.\n\n726\n00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,120\n>> And let let's fire it up.\n\n727\n00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,852\n>> 'Kay.\n\n728\n00:36:09,852 --> 00:36:12,760\nAll right so, let's talk about the steps\nhere that we actually need to have right.\n\n729\n00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,860\n>> Okay.\n>> If we are going to create a roaming\n\n730\n00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,880\nprofile right.\n\n731\n00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n732\n00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,950\n>> That means first of all we need\na location to store the profile.\n\n733\n00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n734\n00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,490\nThat location for us is a network share,\nand that normally is going to be stored\n\n735\n00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,455\nsomewhere on a different server, that's\nnot directly connected to the computer.\n\n736\n00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:32,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n737\n00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,242\n>> Yeah.\n\n738\n00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:36,100\n>> All right so, so you want me\nto check for a a network share?\n\n739\n00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,150\n>> Let's check, Let's, let's go ahead and\ncheck for a network share or\n\n740\n00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,242\nlet's create one either one.\n\n741\n00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,378\n>> All right, okay, so\non, on my machine here.\n\n742\n00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:44,232\nYep, all right,\nlet me get back up in there.\n\n743\n00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:48,620\nAll right so,\nI've got a a domain controller here and\n\n744\n00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,440\nwe'll we'll be using this\nguy as our server today.\n\n745\n00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,530\nAnd we have a share down here,\nso in Files and\n\n746\n00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:03,210\nwe have one called Profiles and already in\nhere we have Jay's profile and my profile.\n\n747\n00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,842\nThat's all we got, so yes, so\nwe do have a location it will go.\n\n748\n00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:11,320\n>> All right so, now that we have\na location of where it will go.\n\n749\n00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,150\nWhat's our, what do we have to have\nnow that we have our location?\n\n750\n00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,450\nWe need to modify the local\nuser's profile somehow don't we?\n\n751\n00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n752\n00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,960\n>> So what are we doing here?\n\n753\n00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,510\nAll right, so let let's do this.\n\n754\n00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,525\nSo on on client number two.\n\n755\n00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:26,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I'm, I'm not sure that so\n\n756\n00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,295\nyeah we did look at those user profiles.\n\n757\n00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So let's have you sign into client,\n\n758\n00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:31,760\nclient two.\n\n759\n00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,780\n>> Dang it.\n\n760\n00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,470\n>> And that'd be 22 correct?\n\n761\n00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,926\n>> Yeah.\nYep, and\n\n762\n00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:40,010\nyou wanna be Ronny at chickabow.net.\n\n763\n00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:46,890\nAnd the password that you use for every,\nand your very unique secure password.\n\n764\n00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,240\n>> So unique that I've forgotten.\n\n765\n00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,450\nSmartphones the death of me on that.\n\n766\n00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,400\nI absolutely have checking\neverything on the smart phone.\n\n767\n00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,640\nThat's just me I can't type.\n\n768\n00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,570\nYeah, on,\non that sense it has just killed me.\n\n769\n00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,060\nI can't remember a single\npassword anymore,\n\n770\n00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,730\nbecause I check everything\non the phone and so\n\n771\n00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,160\nthe, the chance of me changing that is\njust when i'm told I have to change it.\n\n772\n00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,670\nAye.\n\n773\n00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,372\n>> Oh, oh.\n>> Oh, I'm signed in, but yeah, click yes.\n\n774\n00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:22,425\n>> All right so, now I'm gonna kick maybe.\n\n775\n00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,780\n>> Mm-hm yeah that should go.\n\n776\n00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,910\n>> Don't see it says waiting for Mike.\n\n777\n00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,060\nMike has apparently signed\nin on the intermission.\n\n778\n00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,800\n>> Mm yeah I wonder what\nhe's doing on there?\n\n779\n00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,755\n>> I don't know\n>> I wonder if he's browsing, no.\n\n780\n00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:36,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Clearing off some internet history or\n\n781\n00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,630\nsomething for himself.\n\n782\n00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,840\n>> Yeah, clearing that out.\n\n783\n00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,080\n>> Yeah.\n>> I guess I probably click over,\n\n784\n00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,645\nclick over it and see what it says.\n\n785\n00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:47,560\n>> Okay, now I've never signed on\nto this particular machine before,\n\n786\n00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,310\nwhich now means it's going to generate\nmy local profile on this machine.\n\n787\n00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,380\nNow I'm a domain user.\n\n788\n00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,950\nKay?\n\n789\n00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:00,090\nSo that means I do have an account\nin this network domain but\n\n790\n00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,570\nthen it's also got to generate again\na copy of my profile here, kay?\n\n791\n00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,340\nIt's what it's got to do.\n\n792\n00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,300\nSo, hopefully it's gonna take a little,\nnot too long,\n\n793\n00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,090\nbut, it make more time\nthan I realize here.\n\n794\n00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,210\n>> But\nit does take a moment to actually do this.\n\n795\n00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,950\n>> Kind of, dragging along there.\n\n796\n00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,600\nWell all right, it I,\nI guess to yeah let's move along.\n\n797\n00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,530\nOh I did, I did click over to Mike and\nI chose okay to allow.\n\n798\n00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,160\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n799\n00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,670\n>> You to log on there.\n\n800\n00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,120\nGuess we'll give it\na minute all right now.\n\n801\n00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,880\nTo figure Roman profiles it's,\nit's actually pretty easy.\n\n802\n00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,060\nWhat I think, it doesn't require\na whole lot of change and\n\n803\n00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,170\nyou don't really,\nI guess have to have a network and,\n\n804\n00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,760\nyou know, a domain environment or\nanything like that.\n\n805\n00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,420\nI mean, all you got to do is go into,\nyour user profile and\n\n806\n00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,490\nselect where you want that to be.\n\n807\n00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:55,910\nNow, for our demonstrations we will be\nusing a, a domain, a domain account.\n\n808\n00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,700\nWe'll go that route.\n\n809\n00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,490\n>> Sure.\n>> But all right, so yeah.\n\n810\n00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,416\nYou got logged in?\n>> Yup, I'm now logged in, and\n\n811\n00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:07,000\nnow if I go and take a look at\nmy files here So, I'm logged in.\n\n812\n00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,590\nI'm gonna go down to my file explorer.\n\n813\n00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,733\nAnd on the file explorer I'm\ngonna look for the local disk C,\n\n814\n00:40:13,733 --> 00:40:17,690\nwhere the actual user\nprofiles are actually stored.\n\n815\n00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:22,162\nNow there's been a kind of a weird\nthing on user profiles recently on 8.1.\n\n816\n00:40:22,162 --> 00:40:25,150\nThey, you, don't recommend that\nyou actually mess around with it.\n\n817\n00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,800\nThey've stored it here.\n\n818\n00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,612\nThat's where they want it kept.\n\n819\n00:40:27,612 --> 00:40:29,580\nPretty much at this particular point.\n\n820\n00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,080\nNow, if I go into my own folder,\nokay, there it is.\n\n821\n00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,280\nSo I am done, Nate.\n\n822\n00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,560\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> How do I get us rolling.\n\n823\n00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,300\nAllright.\n\n824\n00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,410\n>> Let, so let's,\n\n825\n00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,900\nlet's create a file on your desktop\n>> Okay.\n\n826\n00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,340\n>> And we'll just, you can just call it\n>> whatever, whatever you want.\n\n827\n00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,390\nI don't know what stuff that you work on\nwhat was that, Cisco commands, that works.\n\n828\n00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,067\nCisco Commands, Cisco Stuff, I like that.\n\n829\n00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:55,850\n>> Cisco Stuff.\n\n830\n00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,875\nAllright, Cisco Stuff.\n\n831\n00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,963\nSo,so, allright so there we go.\n\n832\n00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:03,746\nNow if if we went over to client one\nthat you signed on previously because\n\n833\n00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:09,060\nyou're on client two then Cisco Stuff\nwould not, would be on there, be on there.\n\n834\n00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,825\n>> That is true.\n\n835\n00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:13,260\n>> Allright so we can so\nshould we just set up profiles now and\n\n836\n00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,240\nthen we can jump over there and\nsee if it's in the syncs.\n\n837\n00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,400\n>> Let's see what happens.\n\n838\n00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,300\n>> Allright.\n\n839\n00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,648\nSo what what we'll do is so here on my,\nmy machine we'll allright so\n\n840\n00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:24,308\nwe'll go in,\nlet's pull up Ronnie's profile.\n\n841\n00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:31,611\n[SOUND]\n>> Allright, Ronnie's profile.\n\n842\n00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:34,914\nNow will be the now, so yes, so\n\n843\n00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:39,759\nwe're going through as\nif it was in a domain.\n\n844\n00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:45,395\nIf it was\n\n845\n00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:51,023\non local.\n\n846\n00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,230\n>> So.\n\n847\n00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,275\nAlright so same place right?\n\n848\n00:41:55,275 --> 00:41:56,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you know profile, profile path.\n\n849\n00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,355\nAnd we, we type it in if that was\nyou know not on a domain computer.\n\n850\n00:42:00,355 --> 00:42:01,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n851\n00:42:01,120 -->

Ronnie's username is, or\n\n859\n00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,795\nprofile name that it will\ncreate a folder with that name.\n\n860\n00:42:37,795 --> 00:42:38,940\n>> Mm-hm.\nIt's\n\n861\n00:42:38,940

has to exist first.\n\n864\n00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:48,325\nIf you do this without\nthe network share existing first,\n\n865\n00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,270\nit's gonna cause you a lot of

00:43:11,070\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign out of this one.\n\n878\n00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,100\nAllright.\nAnd when it goes back to there, yep.\n\n879\n00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:19,408\nLet's go back to remote and\nthen we'll go to 221.\n\n880\n00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:22,478\nAnd connect.\n\n881\n00:43:25,427 --> 00:43:27,030\nAnd your unique password.\n\n882\n00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,846\n>>

signing\nonto another machine.\n\n886\n00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:42,320\nWhere I have logged out of the of\nthe client two machine, which means\n\n887\n00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,330\nif I've redirected my profile, it should\nhave stored it up on that network share.\n\n888\n00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:49,135\nSo, all the changes I've made there\nshould now be stored stored up there.\n\n889\n00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:52,775\nAnd now when I log on this\nmachine as a domain user,\n\n890\n00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:55,905\nit should have drawn that\nprofile back down on this one.\n\n891\n00:43:55,905 -->

and\n\n909\n00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,382\nwe can see if it even\ncreated that profile there.\n\n910\n00:44:28,382 --> 00:44:29,380\n>> I'm surprised.\n\n911\n00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,600\n>> So go into files, and profiles.\n\n912\n00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,570\nSure enough.\n\n913\n00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,490\n>> There it is.\n\n914\n00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:40,197\n>> Oh yeah, I forgot to

confused,\nallright, so yeah.\n\n921\n00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,460\nSo it did, it did, it did create it.\n\n922\n00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,010\n>> Ya, there's, there's a little known\nweird, weird thing about roaming profiles.\n\n923\n00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,480\nSometimes you have to sign in and\n\n924\n00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,900\nsign out a couple of times before it\nactually works, I don't know why.\n\n925\n00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,130\nI'm sure somebody does.\n\n926\n00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:06,230\nBut me, I, I don't remember exactly why,\nbut sometimes it does take that, so\n\n927\n00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,620\nlet's go ahead and see if that works too.\n\n928\n00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,340\nI just remembered it myself here.\n\n929\n00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,400\nSo let me go and sign back on to\nthat machine and let's try it again.\n\n930\n00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,540\nLet's see if actually my\nprofile gets kept in.\n\n931\n00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,910\n>> Mm.\n>> Let me go back into my remote desktop.\n\n932\n00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,160\nAm I suppose to put, so\ndid you sign out then of, of client one?\n\n933\n00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,005\n>> I did, I did.\n\n934\n00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:27,970\n>> Allright, so\nwe're going back into client one?\n\n935\n00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,315\n>> We're going back into client two.\n\n936\n00:45:29,315 -->

users.\n\n1014\n00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:46,260\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So\n\n1015\n00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,830\nit did create that roaming\nprofile up on the network share.\n\n1016\n00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:51,940\n>> Yep, but it's not pulling it down.\n\n1017\n00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,907\n>> Well there we go, yeah,\nsharing network path yeah, it's just not.\n\n1018\n00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,886\nPulling everything down there.\n\n1019\n00:49:01,913 --> 00:49:02,413\nHm.\n\n1020\n00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:07,992\n>> Gotta make sure we actually\ndo have the proper permissions.\n\n1021\n00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:09,832\nWe need full control on\nour own permissions.\n\n1022\n00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:14,866\nAs well, okay?\n\n1023\n00:49:14,866 --> 00:49:21,740\nAll right so for us here there's gotta\nbe a couple of other issues going on.\n\n1024\n00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,560\nWe might have to again check on some other\nthings in terms of your group policies and\n\n1025\n00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,200\nseeing why it's not able to do that.\n\n1026\n00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,470\nNow, did I sign in with the actual\ncorrect credentials, I guess,\n\n1027\n00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,380\nis the next thing here.\n\n1028\n00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,145\nSure looks like it.\n\n1029\n00:49:36,145 --> 00:49:37,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1030\n00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,819\n>> Make sure I didn't sign in\nwith some other account name.\n\n1031\n00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:51,182\nWell no shirt on.\n\n1032\n00:49:51,182 --> 00:49:53,630\n>> So that is, that is the key.\n\n1033\n00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n1034\n00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,220\n>> That that is in there.\n\n1035\n00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,680\nWell, let perhaps you know,\nduring the break, we'll we,\n\n1036\n00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,090\nwe'll take a gander at it and\nsee what's going on.\n\n1037\n00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:01,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n1038\n00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,970\nBut.\n\n1039\n00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,250\nSo, after roaming profiles,\n\n1040\n00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:11,225\nthe next thing to jump into is\nthe idea of mandatory profiles.\n\n1041\n00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:12,006\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now, we did\n\n1042\n00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:14,782\ntalk briefly about\nmandatory profiles before.\n\n1043\n00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:17,342\n>> Right.\n>> And it's sort of similar to yeah, sort\n\n1044\n00:50:17,342 --> 00:50:22,360\nof similar to roaming profiles, but it's\nlike a, a read-only, read-only profile.\n\n1045\n00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And you know, you know, and\n\n1046\n00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,920\nconfiguring this guy is\nI think also kinda easy.\n\n1047\n00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,441\nIt's just one, one little change.\n\n1048\n00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:33,798\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The NT user dot dat file, all right?\n\n1049\n00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:40,885\nJust the simple rename of,\nof that guy an NT user dot man.\n\n1050\n00:50:40,885 --> 00:50:42,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Is that correct Ronny?\n\n1051\n00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:42,870\n>> That is.\n\n1052\n00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:47,590\n>> So we bring my screen back up\nhere since as we take a look here.\n\n1053\n00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,560\nSo we're going to go in and we're gong to\ncheck on that roaming file when we get\n\n1054\n00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,890\nback here but\nif we go to the user's folder and\n\n1055\n00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:58,760\nwe go into my folder here, okay?\n\n1056\n00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,290\nUsually it shows up right here.\n\n1057\n00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,630\nNow the reason why I kind of turned\nsome stuff off so we couldn't see it.\n\n1058\n00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,540\nIt's because it is a hidden file.\n\n1059\n00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,140\nIt is what we call a system file.\n\n1060\n00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,040\nAnd that's because it's part\nof the registry in 8.1.\n\n1061\n00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,550\nIf you want to get in here to\nchange this to a mandatory profile,\n\n1062\n00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:19,680\nyou would have to actually go into\nyour Explorer and go into View, and\n\n1063\n00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,430\nover here underneath options,\nyou select options, and then change folder\n\n1064\n00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,880\ninsert options, and then here is where you\nactually get all the way back and then.\n\n1065\n00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,970\nThis has actually remained unchanged,\nas far as I know since forever and a day.\n\n1066\n00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:35,270\nI remember doing this in XP here.\n\n1067\n00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:41,040\nI clicked on View and now in the Advanced\nSettings Show Hidden Files and Folders,\n\n1068\n00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,740\nI thought that that's all we needed to\ndo and Hide Extension you uncheck that.\n\n1069\n00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,400\nYou have to scroll a little\nbit on the 8.1 here.\n\n1070\n00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,430\nAnd what you're looking for is right,\nI don't wat to delete anything,\n\n1071\n00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:56,860\nwhere it says\nHide Protected Operating System Files.\n\n1072\n00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,529\nIt says it is recommended, but\nif I want to see that NT user dot dat.\n\n1073\n00:52:00,529 --> 00:52:07,840\nI want to go ahead and say yes, and\nuncheck that I click apply and okay.\n\n1074\n00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,560\nAnd now you actually there is\na lot of other hidden information\n\n1075\n00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,730\non my particular user profile, okay.\n\n1076\n00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:18,548\nIf I scroll down,\nthere is the NT user dot dat right there.\n\n1077\n00:52:18,548 --> 00:52:19,593\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1078\n00:52:19,593 --> 00:52:20,342\n>> Okay.\n\n1079\n00:52:20,342 --> 00:52:26,160\n>> All right, yeah, and you know, renaming\nthat guy to take out that dot dat,\n\n1080\n00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,118\nand renaming to dot man\nwill then turn that into a-\n\n1081\n00:52:31,118 --> 00:52:32,688\n>> Mandatory profile.\n\n1082\n00:52:32,688 --> 00:52:33,280\n>> Um-hm.\n\n1083\n00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:33,920\nSure will.\n\n1084\n00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,345\n>> Yeah.\nWe, we don't want to do it yet\n\n1085\n00:52:35,345 --> 00:52:37,960\ncuz since we're, still working with\nthe roaming profile a little bit we'll\n\n1086\n00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,760\ncome back after our break and\nthen we'll come back and do this again.\n\n1087\n00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,830\nBut that is the first step for us in\nterms of doing the mandatory profile.\n\n1088\n00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,160\nAnd remember with the idea of\nmandatory profile it's simple.\n\n1089\n00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,860\nI want to keep everybody's profile.\n\n1090\n00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,760\n>> Essentially one profile.\n\n1091\n00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,680\nSo that when they do log off\nthe changes again are actually removed,\n\n1092\n00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,840\nand now another user again logs in and\nthey configure whatever they want to.\n\n1093\n00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,470\nAnd we don't want those profiles to stay.\n\n1094\n00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,530\nMandatory profiles are the way to go.\n\n1095\n00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:08,180\nYou generally see this,\nin businesses on things like kiosks.\n\n1096\n00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,690\nA lot of times where you do have multiple\nusers coming in and, and logging in,\n\n1097\n00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,305\nyou don't want profiles to grow big.\n\n1098\n00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:13,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1099\n00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,410\n>> And you just keep them,\nfairly static here.\n\n1100\n00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:19,550\nThis is one of the ways to do that,\nas well.\n\n1101\n00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,540\n>> All right.\n\n1102\n00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,040\nYeah we we've got a few minutes left but\n\n1103\n00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,360\nyeah if you want we can\njust take a little break.\n\n1104\n00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,160\n>> Sure.\n>> From here,\n\n1105\n00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:30,340\nyeah we'll dive into that roaming profile.\n\n1106\n00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,630\n>> I'll see what I've,\nI've done to this poor guy.\n\n1107\n00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,970\nI should revert these virtual machines,\n[LAUGH] after I mess with them so much.\n\n1108\n00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,060\n>> That's fine.\n>> But yeah, so we'll take a break here.\n\n1109\n00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:44,450\nWhen we come back, we'll get back\ninto the mandatory profiles.\n\n1110\n00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:47,861\nAnd a few more stuff to come and\nwe'll get to that after the break.\n\n1111\n00:53:47,861 --> 00:53:55,325\n>> All right.\n[MUSIC]\n\n1112\n00:53:55,325 --> 00:53:57,520\nAll right.\nWelcome back.\n\n1113\n00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,140\nAs we continue on through our\nsegment here on User Profiles.\n\n1114\n00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,230\nWe're continuing on to the mandatory\nprofiles at this point.\n\n1115\n00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:05,870\nRight.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1116\n00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,380\n>> Our roaming profiles we'll,\n\n1117\n00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,275\nwe'll probably get back to that in another\nshow again at some point in the future.\n\n1118\n00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:14,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But in terms of mandatory profiles here\n\n1119\n00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,850\nwe want to make sure\nthat we understand that,\n\n1120\n00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:18,779\nyou may see this like I said previously.\n\n1121\n00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,440\n>> When you do see kiosk in places where\nagain, multiple users are actually using\n\n1122\n00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,210\nthe same computer you wanna try and\nminimize the hard drive space\n\n1123\n00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:32,130\nthat's being used and keep everybody\nthat's using the same profile.\n\n1124\n00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:36,130\n>> We can configure the idea of mandatory\nprofiles on that computer, and that\n\n1125\n00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:40,100\nwill allow for a user to log in, make all\nthe changes they need to at that point.\n\n1126\n00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,010\nWhen they log off,\nchanges essentially are not gonna be keep.\n\n1127\n00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,240\nOkay?\nYep.\n\n1128\n00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:45,740\n>> Yeah.\n\n1129\n00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,100\nAnd yep, setting that up.\n\n1130\n00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:52,580\nYou just change that, yeah that file\nfrom a dot dat to a dot man and\n\n1131\n00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,165\nthen you set that up.\n\n1132\n00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:54,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1133\n00:54:54,870 --> 00:55:00,330\n>> Now with the idea of super\nmandatory profiles, what that does\n\n1134\n00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,090\nis yeah, the, the, those changes-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1135\n00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,010\n>> If, if the network share\nis unavailable, so say, so\n\n1136\n00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:10,590\nyou sit down out your computer you're\nconfigured for a super mandatory profile,\n\n1137\n00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:14,970\nif you go to log on, if that network\nshare, where your profile resides\n\n1138\n00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,630\nis not available,\n>> Then it would, it won't work.\n\n1139\n00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,430\nYou just, you will,\nyou will be unable to sign in.\n\n1140\n00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:24,190\nWith a regular mandatory profile,\nwe sit down there.\n\n1141\n00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:30,140\nIf the network share is unavailable,\nthen it will create a, a temporary folder.\n\n1142\n00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,100\nIt will still allow you to sign\non with a temporary account.\n\n1143\n00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,518\nBut, but you still get to work.\n\n1144\n00:55:36,518 --> 00:55:37,049\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1145\n00:55:37,049 --> 00:55:38,360\n>> So mandatory.\n\n1146\n00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,830\n>> If the share is not available.\n\n1147\n00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:44,700\nIf it cannot pull down that profile down\nthere, then out of luck, out of gas, and\n\n1148\n00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,380\nyou cannot log on.\n\n1149\n00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,100\nSo, yep,\nthat's the big difference between the two.\n\n1150\n00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,113\n>> Yeah.\nAnd this really does help because\n\n1151\n00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:55,901\nit actually allows, then, for people that\nare, are, not necessarily needing to\n\n1152\n00:55:55,901 --> 00:55:59,072\nconnect to the network when\nthat share is not available For\n\n1153\n00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:01,530\nus to be able to have some\ncontrol over that and\n\n1154\n00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,200\nthat super-mandatory profile\nreally does help us out.\n\n1155\n00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,430\nSo for example, if you do have users that\nare logging in even at home but you don't\n\n1156\n00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:15,350\nwant them doing it during the weekend, you\nmay go ahead and disable the connection to\n\n1157\n00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:19,660\ntheir user profile at that point, the,\nthe, the super-mandatory profile, and\n\n1158\n00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,300\nthat way it's not gonna actually pull\nover if this share is not available.\n\n1159\n00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,910\nSo, so that's a, a good control for us.\n\n1160\n00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:30,550\nRegular mandatory profiles, as long as\nyou actually have it set up correctly,\n\n1161\n00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,490\nshould work regardless of whether or\nnot that share is available for us, so.\n\n1162\n00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We're gonna take a look at\n\n1163\n00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,300\nthe configuration error.\n\n1164\n00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,800\n>> Yeah, let's go and set your profile\nto a consumer mandatory profile.\n\n1165\n00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,860\n>> Okay. All right. Sounds good.\n\n1166\n00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:45,780\n>> All right, so on this little computer\nhere, what, what we'll do is we will\n\n1167\n00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:50,810\nbrowse into, into that, that shared folder\nwhere we have all that stuff set up.\n\n1168\n00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,660\nAnd our profiles.\n\n1169\n00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,050\nAnd so there is Ronnie's V2,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1170\n00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,940\n>> His, his roaming profile.\n\n1171\n00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,300\nThat's,\n>> It's not copying down, but\n\n1172\n00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,940\nit is there, yeah.\n\n1173\n00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,520\n>> It, it, it, it doesn't roam very well.\n\n1174\n00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,688\nAnd, you know, I, I was telling\nRonnie on these machines I for the,\n\n1175\n00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:06,350\nthe 688 stuff-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1176\n00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:10,517\n>> I've got UAV turned on and\nI've got Windows Intune plugged in

yeah.\n\n1180\n00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:15,143\n>> Yeah, and I, and\nI didn't revert all of these machines\n\n1181\n00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:16,040\nbeforehand-\n>> Yeah that's fine.\n\n1182\n00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,410\n>> But so there you go.\n\n1183\n00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:22,476\nNow to do this we'll just click on Prop,\noh I guess we can do it here.\n\n1184\n00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:33,976\n[SOUND] Well, that's funny,\ncuz I am an administrator here.\n\n1185\n00:57:37,776 --> 00:57:41,856\nWe'll go the long way.\n\n1186\n00:57:49,726 --> 00:57:54,726\nAnd, yep,\nit does not want me to rename that guy.\n\n1187\n00:57:54,726 --> 00:57:57,706\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1188\n00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:01,190\nI don't know that your user account\ndoes not seem to be able to do that.\n\n1189\n00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,750\nSo I wonder if there are some\nother controls set up there, okay?\n\n1190\n00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:10,346\nNow, when you do see this, the, the key\nhere on that super-mandatory, of course,\n\n1191\n00:58:10,346 --> 00:58:15,635\nis the term where we rename the entire\nfolder there to the username Ronnie.man,\n\n1192\n00:58:15,635 --> 00:58:19,720\nM-A-N for mandatory and\nthen it ends with a V2, okay?\n\n1193\n00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,725\nAnd that will keep, again,\nthe ID of that configuration\n\n1194\n00:58:23,725 --> 00:58:28,437\njust as that super-mandatory only\nif this folder is available online.\n\n1195\n00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:30,527\nThen we will actually\nbuild a connect to it.\n\n1196\n00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,557\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1197\n00:58:31,557 --> 00:58:32,057\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n1198\n00:58:32,057 --> 00:58:33,738\nNow, as far as, you know, these,\n\n1199\n00:58:33,738 --> 00:58:36,517\nthese profiles roaming around\nbetween these certain computers-\n\n1200\n00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:37,017\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1201\n00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,520\n>> We did bring up primary computers.\n\n1202\n00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1203\n00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,692\n>> That you can use primary computers to,\nI guess,\n\n1204\n00:58:42,692 --> 00:58:46,685\nselect which machines are gonna be\nthe ones that your profile roams to.\n\n1205\n00:58:46,685 --> 00:58:47,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1206\n00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,670\n>> Let's say that you know,\nyou are in a, I don't know, R&D and\n\n1207\n00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:54,150\nyou go out to a some computer\nthat you have to log on to,\n\n1208\n00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,918\nI don't know, fix something-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1209\n00:58:55,918 --> 00:58:57,460\n>> Or, or have to log into something.\n\n1210\n00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,460\nAnd if you are configured with those\nroaming profiles, then you, you may not\n\n1211\n00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:04,950\nwant that profile pulled out and stored\non whatever computer you're getting onto.\n\n1212\n00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:05,871\nIt, like a kiosk-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1213\n00:59:05,871 --> 00:59:07,430\n>> Earlier that you brought up.\n\n1214\n00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:12,360\nSo we can set up primary computers so\nthat only on the computers that we\n\n1215\n00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:17,690\nspecify will the profile actually you\nknow, I guess get pulled down to.\n\n1216\n00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:18,710\n>> Yeah.\n>> And we can set that up.\n\n1217\n00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,410\nAnd it takes a couple of steps.\n\n1218\n00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:24,330\nAnd, yeah, we can go ahead and yeah, I,\nI guess go through that and set it up.\n\n1219\n00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:25,190\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n1220\n00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,350\n>> Yeah, no, yeah,\njust remember that, that for us here,\n\n1221\n00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,460\nwhen we start talking about using the\nprimary computers, right, we're limited\n\n1222\n00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,630\nnow to just Windows 8 and Windows 8.1,\n>> And that's key, right?\n\n1223\n00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,760\nSo if you try and\ngo to a Windows 7 machine and\n\n1224\n00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,840\ndo this, it's not gonna work, okay?\n\n1225\n00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,618\nNow this does require a little bit more\nset-up to actually get in there and do,\n\n1226\n00:59:43,618 --> 00:59:45,860\nbut we're gonna show you the steps here.\n\n1227\n00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1228\n00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:52,194\nAll right, first things first, all right,\nwe do need to grab the, so we'll need\n\n1229\n00:59:52,194 --> 00:59:55,190\nthe distinguished name of the computer-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1230\n00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,980\n>> That we're, we're wanting to get.\n\n1231\n00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,190\n>> All right.\n\n1232\n00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,450\n>> So this is the, the, the computer\nthat we wanna make a primary computer.\n\n1233\n01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:02,233\nIs that right, Nate?\n\n1234\n01:00:02,233 --> 01:00:03,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n1235\n01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:03,750\n>> Yep, all right.\n\n1236\n01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,060\nSo we start off in in\nActive Directory Administrative

super fancy.\n\n1240\n01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:15,310\nThis will allow us to grab that\nthat distinguished name in there.\n\n1241\n01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:15,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1242\n01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:17,704\n>> And so yeah, then the attributes and\n\n1243\n01:00:17,704 --> 01:00:18,280\nstuff\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1244\n01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,020\n>> Of course, I'm sure there's\na power show

and\n\n1247\n01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:31,652\nwe'll find a computer that we want.\n\n1248\n01:00:36,972 --> 01:00:38,890\nAll right, Ronnie, so\nlet's let's pick one.\n\n1249\n01:00:38,890 -->

right.\n\n1252\n01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:53,410\nAnd we'll go down into Extensions >\nAttribute Editor, and then this guy is.\n\n1253\n01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:56,263\nOop, you just passed it.\n\n1254\n01:00:56,263 --> 01:00:57,900\n>> There it is.\n\n1255\n01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,279\n>> Distinguish name.\n\n1256\n01:00:59,279 --> 01:01:03,845\nAll right, and\nthen I will copy that

more\ndistinguished than that.\n\n1270\n01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,330\n>> All right so once we have that, so now\nwe need to go to the, the user's profile\n\n1271\n01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:41,920\nthat, that we want to set up, so\nI will just cancel out of this.\n\n1272\n01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,800\nWe'll minimize that.\n\n1273\n01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,410\nAll right.\n\n1274\n01:01:45,410 -->

01:03:40,288\nwe've designated the the computers.\n\n1327\n01:03:40,288 --> 01:03:41,295\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> In there.\n\n1328\n01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:45,160\nAll right, and so now we need to,\nI guess, enforce it.\n\n1329\n01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:45,760\n>> Right.\n\n1330\n01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,048\n>> And\nwe will use that through group policy.\n\n1331\n01:03:48,048 --> 01:03:50,299\nAnd.\n\n1332\n01:03:50,299 --> 01:03:56,129\n[SOUND] And-\n>> Where did you put it?\n\n1333\n01:03:56,129 --> 01:03:57,459\nYeah, I guess it didn't create one.\n\n1334\n01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:58,419\nSo, let's just do one real quick.\n\n1335\n01:03:58,419 --> 01:03:59,959\n>> Allright.\n\n1336\n01:03:59,959 --> 01:04:03,575\n>> Allright.\nWe'll just call this one primary\n\n1337\n01:04:03,575 --> 01:04:04,819\ncomputers.\n\n1338\n01:04:09,189 --> 01:04:10,319\nWe'll edit this guy.\n\n1339\n01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:16,995\nAllright.\nAnd so, then this one will be in.\n\n1340\n01:04:16,995 --> 01:04:21,010\nLet's see,\ncomputer configurations, policies.\n\n1341\n01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,170\n>> Yep.\n\n1342\n01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:23,860\n>> Mystery of templates.\n\n1343\n01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,880\n>> And now it's system.\n\n1344\n01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,530\n>> System.\n\n1345\n01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:29,310\n>> And you should see user\nprofiles down toward the bottom.\n\n1346\n01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:40,460\nI just saw it, download roaming\nprofiles on primary computers only.\n\n1347\n01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,010\n>> Allright.\n\n1348\n01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,370\n>> We'll do this guy, and enable it.\n\n1349\n01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:46,040\nThere we go.\n\n1350\n01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:46,540\nApply.\n\n1351\n01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:48,620\nOkay.\n\n1352\n01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:51,400\nNow, roman profiles and\nnow, we did not cover\n\n1353\n01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,980\nfolder redirection in this particular\none cuz I guess, further up the list.\n\n1354\n01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,060\nObjectives covered on here.\n\n1355\n01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:00,460\nWe talked about, folder redirection.\n\n1356\n01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,260\nBut, if we wanted to add\nfolder redirection, for\n\n1357\n01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,400\nprimary computers further up\nthe list in folder redirection.\n\n1358\n01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,180\n>> And redirect folders.\n\n1359\n01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,180\n>> We got this policy here.\n\n1360\n01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:13,660\nRedirect folders on\nprimary computers only.\n\n1361\n01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,370\nWe won't enforce this one since we,\nyou know, we haven't set up any of that\n\n1362\n01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,220\n>> You know, for\n\n1363\n01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,190\nthis particular set of demos so\nI'll cancel out of that.\n\n1364\n01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:22,720\nWe'll close out of our editor.\n\n1365\n01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:29,420\nAnd then we'll come up here to\nthe OU which are stuff is in,\n\n1366\n01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,220\nwe'll go and link that GPO.\n\n1367\n01:05:36,115 --> 01:05:39,320\nAllright, and we should be good.\n\n1368\n01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,830\nAllright.\n>> At least for a little wh-, while right?\n\n1369\n01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:46,420\nUntil we actually go ahead and do a GP\nupdate or we allow for the time to.\n\n1370\n01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,955\nTo allow for the GPO to push out.\n\n1371\n01:05:47,955 --> 01:05:51,578\n>> Um-hm.\nYeah, now at at this point since we had\n\n1372\n01:05:51,578 --> 01:05:56,400\nboth those, I guess we did add\nboth those computers in there.\n\n1373\n01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,460\nSo yeah so the next time that Ronnie\nwould go to login to either client,\n\n1374\n01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,990\nwell I guess not client one or client two.\n\n1375\n01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,813\nThat one will work fine.\n\n1376\n01:06:02,813 --> 01:06:04,200\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1377\n01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,680\n>> Where the other client computers then,\nsure enough.\n\n1378\n01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,540\nYou know.\n\n1379\n01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:13,850\nIt, you would not be able to log in and it\nwould the, pull down a, a temporary copy.\n\n1380\n01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,804\nOh yeah.\nLike, my user profile that.\n\n1381\n01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:16,464\n>> There you go.\n\n1382\n01:06:16,464 --> 01:06:18,629\n>> Somehow didn't revert\nitself back to each other.\n\n1383\n01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:19,310\n>> Right.\n\n1384\n01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:20,220\n>> But, yeah.\n\n1385\n01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,879\nLog into that, it would, just create\na temporary profile that would be lost.\n\n1386\n01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,698\nYeah, when I sign out.\n\n1387\n01:06:25,698 --> 01:06:27,912\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1388\n01:06:27,912 --> 01:06:28,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n1389\n01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,470\nWell, that, I guess that's,\nthat on primary computers.\n\n1390\n01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,980\n>> Yeah.\nAllright, so, for us here on user\n\n1391\n01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:40,160\nprofiles, you do see a combination mix\nof all these in, certain environments.\n\n1392\n01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,360\nUsually inside of a business environment,\n\n1393\n01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,900\nrarely do users log in\nwith their local profiles.\n\n1394\n01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,780\nNow, it used to be I,\nI won't say best practice,\n\n1395\n01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,440\nused to be common practice I should say,\nthat a user using a regular computer,\n\n1396\n01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,610\nokay, would've actually been an local\nadministrator on the computer,\n\n1397\n01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:00,150\nas well as using his\n[INAUDIBLE] domain computer.\n\n1398\n01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:03,460\nThat allowed us to be able to\ntroubleshoot relatively easy,\n\n1399\n01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:07,250\nto allow the local user\nto log on that account.\n\n1400\n01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,450\nLog on,\nthen they could install software and\n\n1401\n01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:12,120\nstuff without bothering me\nas a network administrator.\n\n1402\n01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,690\nToday it's no longer\na recommended practice, or\n\n1403\n01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:18,450\neven really a common practice that,\nthat we would like to actually have.\n\n1404\n01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:22,970\nBut it is something that you do see, where\nthe local user profile is still there.\n\n1405\n01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:24,320\nFor users that log in.\n\n1406\n01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,000\nMost of the time in a business,\n\n1407\n01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,910\nonly your domain profile is\nactually going to be there.\n\n1408\n01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:33,780\nWith that you see the common use of\nroaming profiles to help us out as well.\n\n1409\n01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:39,050\nAnd then if you do have special situations\nsuch as needing, where the users\n\n1410\n01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:42,950\nwhen they log off that they, that they\ndon't leave their, their files on there.\n\n1411\n01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:44,430\nWhether it's due to security reasons or\n\n1412\n01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:48,610\nbecause commonly accessible computer for\nthe public here,\n\n1413\n01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:52,860\nit may be where we instead enforce\nthe idea of roaming profiles.\n\n1414\n01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:57,710\nNow, Nate also showed us here at the end\nthe ability to limit the roaming\n\n1415\n01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:02,140\nprofile to certain computers that\nwe call primary computers as well.\n\n1416\n01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,940\nAnd this is an important part again\nof control, and making sure that\n\n1417\n01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:10,920\nusers can only store their information,\nonly on certain computers.\n\n1418\n01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,330\nAnd, this way, we go to another one,\nwe may be able to log in, but\n\n1419\n01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,430\nonly with something that's temporary.\n\n1420\n01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:18,260\nAnd not be able to access anything else,\nwhich is really good.\n\n1421\n01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,280\nBecause this means now,\n\n1422\n01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:23,570\nI can't get into Nate's temporary\nstuff that he needs to get into.\n\n1423\n01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:24,960\n>> No, no, no.\nI, I cleared out all the files.\n\n1424\n01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,052\n>> He clears out he clears it out.\n\n1425\n01:08:26,052 --> 01:08:27,382\n[CROSSTALK].\n>> Yeah, my Pro files are always\n\n1426\n01:08:27,382 --> 01:08:27,973\ntemporary.\n\n1427\n01:08:27,973 --> 01:08:28,612\n>> Always temporary.\n\n1428\n01:08:28,612 --> 01:08:29,120\nSo,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1429\n01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,740\n>> there you go.\n\n1430\n01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:30,575\n>> Yeah.\nNow all right.\n\n1431\n01:08:30,575 --> 01:08:32,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, Roman profiles.\n\n1432\n01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,110\nNow it.\n\n1433\n01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:38,880\nSo you know we do have folder redirection\nand i-, in my opinion I see, ya know,\n\n1434\n01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,870\nroaming profiles as maybe as but ya know.\n\n1435\n01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:47,720\nWith folder redirection whereas you're\nnot pulling the profile down at all.\n\n1436\n01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,330\n>> At all.\n\n1437\n01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:50,410\nRight.\n>> I-, it stays up on the network share\n\n1438\n01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:53,522\nand you just access that that, that there,\n\n1439\n01:08:53,522 --> 01:08:57,530\nand you can\n>> Use it along with offline files, so\n\n1440\n01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:01,230\nyou can still, you know, access stuff if,\nyou know, your network connection's,\n\n1441\n01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:02,780\nyou know, unavailable.\n\n1442\n01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,206\nAnd you know, with, Microsoft accounts.\n\n1443\n01:09:05,206 --> 01:09:05,720\n>> Um-hm.\n\n1444\n01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,280\n>> Right, you can still sync\nyour settings, going that route.\n\n1445\n01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:08,920\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n1446\n01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,800\nyou can attach a Microsoft\naccount to your domain account.\n\n1447\n01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,390\n>> Right.\n\n1448\n01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:16,150\n>> Still go that way and with, with uev.\n\n1449\n01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:20,920\nSo uev, you know, it,\nuser experience virtualization.\n\n1450\n01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,000\nIt, it just syncs user settings and, it,\n>> No files.\n\n1451\n01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,180\n>> Yeah.\nNo files.\n\n1452\n01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:29,210\nBut that coupled with folder redirection,\nyeah.\n\n1453\n01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:29,990\n>> Really good.\n\n1454\n01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:31,430\n>> Every, you know,\neverything is synched up,\n\n1455\n01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:33,020\nyou don't have to pull anything down,\nlocally.\n\n1456\n01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:37,730\nSo, you know, that yeah, I mean, you know,\n\n1457\n01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:42,010\nto me, that I'd rather use for\nthe redirection than roaming profiles.\n\n1458\n01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,930\n>> Yeah, it depends on the context\nthat you're in, and, and\n\n1459\n01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,460\nwhat you actually need to happen.\n\n1460\n01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:49,770\nSo yeah, like Peter, we, we tend to use\na combination of both to, to allow for\n\n1461\n01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:54,930\nusers again to access it when that\nnetwork directory is not available.\n\n1462\n01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:59,990\nAnd so if you, if you do need to have\nsome kind of redundancy in that way,\n\n1463\n01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,722\na combination of both is\nwhat you tend to see.\n\n1464\n01:10:01,722 --> 01:10:02,326\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1465\n01:10:02,326 --> 01:10:02,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1466\n01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:05,790\n>> You know, talking to old Mike Roderick,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1467\n01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:07,580\n>> you know, he told me that on.\n\n1468\n01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:11,150\nOn his, his I guess,\npersonal computer at, at his house.\n\n1469\n01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:12,490\nAnd he doesn't store anything.\n\n1470\n01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:15,000\nReally, on a, on a local drive.\n\n1471\n01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,520\nI'm not sure why you wanna\nkeep his hard drive you know,\n\n1472\n01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,680\navailable to format on a moment's notice.\n\n1473\n01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,040\n>> Wow.\n>> But, yeah, so\n\n1474\n01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:26,395\nhe uses redirection at the house,\nand now with his Microsoft account.\n\n1475\n01:10:26,395 --> 01:10:30,110\nHe's still sync his stuff up and\ngrab all his settings that way.\n\n1476\n01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:31,059\n>> Yep.\nMm-hm.\n\n1477\n01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:32,330\n>> Pretty neat.\n\n1478\n01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:33,860\n>> Yeah, good stuff out there.\n\n1479\n01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:38,340\nWell Ronnie, do you have anything else,\nI guess, to, to add to I\n\n1480\n01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:43,330\nguess user profiles and\nroaming profiles, mandatory profiles?\n\n1481\n01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:46,320\n>> No, I think we've covered\nthe subject relatively well here, and\n\n1482\n01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:50,330\nso if you do need any extra help, though,\n>> Okay.\n\n1483\n01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:54,050\nPlease even as you're watching the

through\n\n3\n00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:15,340\ncovering some of the new\nexam objectives added.\n\n4\n00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,880\n>> Right.\n\n5\n00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,250\n>> In the Windows 8.1 exam\nupdate from January of 2014.\n\n6\n00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,840\nToday we're gonna take\na look at roaming profiles.\n\n7\n00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,640\n>> Right.\n>> And I know we,\n\n8\n00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,120\nwe covered these in another show,\nbut there were so\n\n9\n00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,140\nmany technologies-\n>> Yeah.\n\n10\n00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,850\n>> Being deployed at the same time and\nthat it didn't.\n\n11\n00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,070\nDidn't necessarily come\nthrough very clear.\n\n12\n00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,920\n>> Right.\n>> So what we wanna do is just\n\n13\n00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,480\nreally quick demonstrate exactly\nhow roaming profiles function and\n\n14\n00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,650\nkind of what they are.\n\n15\n00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,440\n>> Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,800\nNow for us the idea of roaming\nprofiles really do help out in a,\n\n17\n00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,540\nin an organization, right?\n\n18\n00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,250\nEspecially when you're actually\nusing multiple desktops or\n\n19\n00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,910\na laptop and a desktop.\n\n20\n00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,270\nAnd you need to have a consistent\nuser interface between them.\n\n21\n00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,540\nWe already talked about\nearlier in another show here.\n\n22\n00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,520\nWhere we can use local desktops or\nlocal profiles here.\n\n23\n00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,930\nThat means on each machine\nit would be different\n\n24\n00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,270\nroaming profiles allows\nus to keep it consistent.\n\n25\n00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,460\nAnd, that way again all of our\nfiles appear on both sides,\n\n26\n00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,700\nand we're ready to go.\n\n27\n00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,340\n>> Yeah, it is really cool.\n\n28\n00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,340\nEspecially for companies that don't\nhave assigned computers to people.\n\n29\n00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,730\n>> Right.\nSo for example, I,\n\n30\n00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,765\nI, I set up a network once for\na real estate company.\n\n31\n00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:19,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n32\n00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,220\nthey had about 40 realtors that\nwould go out and, well, sell houses.\n\n33\n00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,710\nBut they wouldn't spend a lot\nof time in the office, and so\n\n34\n00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,650\nwhen they came to the office,\n\n35\n00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,980\nthey had a row of ten cubicles, and\nall 40 realtors shared these cubes.\n\n36\n00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,170\nAnd they would just sit down at\nwhatever computer was available.\n\n37\n00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,220\nAll right?\nWell the problem is,\n\n38\n00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,570\nif you're using a different computer every\nday, how do you save your documents?\n\n39\n00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,320\nHow do you keep a consistent environment?\n\n40\n00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,910\nSo they used roaming profiles.\n\n41\n00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,330\nNo matter which computer you logged in on.\n\n42\n00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,500\nYour profile followed you.\n\n43\n00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,340\nSo your my documents, your favorites,\nyour desktop wallpaper,\n\n44\n00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,010\nall those little custom settings that-\n>> Yeah.\n\n45\n00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,730\n>> Pertain to you as a user would\nfollow you from machine to machine,\n\n46\n00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,940\nwhich is a very cool thing.\n\n47\n00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,800\nAll right.\n\n48\n00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,660\nIt also made you not\ndependent on one computer, so\n\n49\n00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,290\nif that computer failed, big deal!\n\n50\n00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,450\n>> Right.\n>> You just go to another computer and\n\n51\n00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,980\nthere's your user experience\nthe way that you remember it.\n\n52\n00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,570\nAll right.\n\n53\n00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,020\nSo just as a quick refresher,\nwhen I say user profile, what do I mean?\n\n54\n00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,570\nRight?\n\n55\n00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,290\nWell let's take a look\nat this computer here.\n\n56\n00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,900\nSo this is a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n57\n00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,790\nAnd if I browse onto it's hard drive, on\nthe C drive there's a folder called Users.\n\n58\n00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,870\nAnd whenever a user logs\nin on this computer.\n\n59\n00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,860\nA profile is created for them, and I can\nsee Don, right there, that's my profile.\n\n60\n00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,840\nSo, if I create something\nlike an icon on my desktop,\n\n61\n00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,440\nit goes in this desktop folder.\n\n62\n00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,820\nOr if I put something in My Documents,\nit goes in here.\n\n63\n00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,130\nIf I do something on in Internet Explorer\nI make a favorite, it goes there, right?\n\n64\n00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,090\nSo that's where these values\nare being stored, and, and,\n\n65\n00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,340\nwe can see that pretty easy.\n\n66\n00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,730\nSo like, here on my desktop,\nif I just do a new text document, so\n\n67\n00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,750\nthis will be my test document.\n\n68\n00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,200\nI'll just put that right there on my\ndesktop, and maybe I'll go into my\n\n69\n00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,150\nlet me go into my documents folder here.\n\n70\n00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,170\nSo, here I am in My Documents.\n\n71\n00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:06,110\nActually, I've already got some stuff in\nthere, mission critical data [LAUGH] and\n\n72\n00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,530\na network diagram of some sort.\n\n73\n00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,820\nIt must be from another show.\n\n74\n00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,330\nSo I've already got some things there.\n\n75\n00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,700\nAnd then maybe I'll go\ninto Internet Explorer.\n\n76\n00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,820\nAnd I'll go to.\n\n77\n00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,770\nLet's go to Google.\n\n78\n00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,560\nWe'll go to google.com.\n\n79\n00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,460\nAnd I'm gonna bookmark this web page.\n\n80\n00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,170\nWhenever it gets there.\n\n81\n00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,110\nThere we go.\n\n82\n00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,730\nAnd so I'll go ahead and, and\nadd a bookmark for this page, and\n\n83\n00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,790\nI'm going to add it to my Favorites.\n\n84\n00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,975\nSo that I now have a link for\nGoogle in my Favorites.\n\n85\n00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:34,990\n>> Mmm-hmm.\n\n86\n00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,402\n>> All right.\nNow all those things that I\n\n87\n00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:37,580\ndid are part of my profile.\n\n88\n00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,880\nAnd if I browse on the hard drive,\nDo C: > Users > Don.\n\n89\n00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,610\nIf I go into that desktop folder,\nthere's the test document.\n\n90\n00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,200\nIf I go into the documents folder, there's\nmission critical data and network diagram.\n\n91\n00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,500\nAnd if I go into favorites,\nthere's the google shortcut I made, right?\n\n92\n00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,990\nIt's all part of my profile.\n\n93\n00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,470\nSo with a roaming profile we just\ntell it hey, take this profile, and\n\n94\n00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,840\nstore it somewhere else.\n\n95\n00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,120\nStore it on a shared server that we\ncan access from multiple machines.\n\n96\n00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,310\n>> Right.\n>> Right.\n\n97\n00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,020\nNow the way to do this the best way to do\nis through the Windows active directory.\n\n98\n00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,790\nAll of these computers need to be\nable to talk to each other and\n\n99\n00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,530\nwhen we have a domain environment\nwe have that possibility.\n\n100\n00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,310\nIf these are work group machines there's\nnot really a great way to share a profile.\n\n101\n00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,620\n>> Right.\n>> Across work group machines\n\n102\n00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,660\n>> So we really need to have an active\n\n103\n00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,300\ndirectory and we also need\na centralized shared folder somewhere.\n\n104\n00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,730\nNow Ronnie already made one for\n\n105\n00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,960\nus, he made a shared folder\non our domain controller.\n\n106\n00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,500\nSo if I just browse to that server,\n\n107\n00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,250\nI'll see a shared folder that\nhe made called profiles.\n\n108\n00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,930\nBut not a special folder,\njust a folder and he shared it out.\n\n109\n00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,880\nSo here's this folder, and I can store\nmy user profile there if I'd like to.\n\n110\n00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,280\nSo we just need to jump over\nto the domain controller, so\n\n111\n00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,650\nI'm switching over to my server, and\nI need to find my user account in here.\n\n112\n00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,760\nSo here I am, Don Pizett.\n\n113\n00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,620\nAnd I'll edit my user.\n\n114\n00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,625\nAnd there's a profile tab and under\nthe profile, I can specify that path and\n\n115\n00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:10,395\nyou know, let me, let me just do something\nreal quick I want to zoom in on that.\n\n116\n00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:11,900\nJust, cuz it's kinda small.\n\n117\n00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There we go.\n\n118\n00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,910\nSo you'll see this profile tab, and\nin there we've got a profile path, and\n\n119\n00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,610\nthat's where we can tell Windows where\nwe want to store this user's profile.\n\n120\n00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,690\nAll right?\nNow, I've all ready got a profile, but\n\n121\n00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,760\nthe cool part here is,\n\n122\n00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,010\nwhen I specify this network location,\nit's actually going to copy my data up.\n\n123\n00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,230\nAnd so it will update so\nI don't lose what I have all ready.\n\n124\n00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,290\nI'm not starting from scratch.\n\n125\n00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,160\n>> Right.\n\n126\n00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,820\n>> All right.\n\n127\n00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,980\nSo I just need to punch in\nthat file share location.\n\n128\n00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,350\n>> You do have to spell it correctly.\n\n129\n00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,771\n>> You do [LAUGH].\n\n130\n00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,765\nMm-hm.\n\n131\n00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:41,335\n>> And more importantly-\n>> Yeah.\n\n132\n00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,365\n>> If I just pointed\nstraight to one folder and\n\n133\n00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:47,365\nI point multiple people to that same\nfolder, they're now sharing a profile.\n\n134\n00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:47,875\n>> Yeah.\n\n135\n00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,115\n>> So we normally want to put a,\na user name after it.\n\n136\n00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,507\nSo, I'll, I'll do Don.\n\n137\n00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:56,572\nSo, it's going to be //ITProTV-DC2,\nthat's the server,\n\n138\n00:05:56,572 --> 00:06:01,567\n/profile, that's the shared\nfolder Ronnie made, /don,\n\n139\n00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:05,902\nthat's gonna be a new folder that\njust my profile is a part of.\n\n140\n00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:09,870\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and\nhit apply on that and\n\n141\n00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,990\nnow I have a roaming profile, or I will.\n\n142\n00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,160\nI don't have a roaming profile right\nnow because that folder's empty but\n\n143\n00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,450\nthe next time I log in and\nlog out, when I log out it'll copy\n\n144\n00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,730\nall my data up to that network location\nand from then on, every time I log in,\n\n145\n00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,355\nit'll copy that data down, so\nI've got my previous user experience.\n\n146\n00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:31,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n147\n00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,320\n>> So let's see that in action.\n\n148\n00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,298\nNow, I, I was already logged in here,\nso I'm gonna log out.\n\n149\n00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:38,158\n[BLANK AUDIO].\n\n150\n00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:42,980\nAll right, so I'm just gonna log out of\nthis machine and then I'll log back in.\n\n151\n00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,820\nWhen I log back in, it's gonna see\nthat I have a roaming profile, but\n\n152\n00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,980\nthe roaming profile is empty.\n\n153\n00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,120\nAnd so it's not gonna download anything.\n\n154\n00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800\nSo I should log in pretty quickly here.\n\n155\n00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,910\nWe'll give it a moment while it does that.\n\n156\n00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,108\nSo it, it's finding that roaming profile,\nseeing that it's empty, and you know,\n\n157\n00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:02,110\nbasically ignoring it.\n\n158\n00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,820\nBut when I log out, though,\nit's gonna synchronize my changes.\n\n159\n00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,560\nIt'll take my profile on this machine and\n\n160\n00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,910\nupload it to the server, and so\nwe should be able to see it there.\n\n161\n00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,700\nSo now I'm logged back in, so here I am,\nI've got my test document on my desktop,\n\n162\n00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,660\nI've got my you know why do I not have\na documents link in my libraries up here?\n\n163\n00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,000\nWhat have I done to this system?\n\n164\n00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,800\nNope.\n\n165\n00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,300\nWell, anyhow.\n\n166\n00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,620\nOh, it said there was a problem.\n\n167\n00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,470\nOh, probably the fact that it was empty.\n\n168\n00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,620\nSo I'm not too worried about that,\nso I'll go into my, documents.\n\n169\n00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,570\nI wanna make sure I've got\nthose documents right there so\n\n170\n00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,590\nit looks like I've got everything\nthat I need, so that's good.\n\n171\n00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,610\nAnd now I'm gonna log-out.\n\n172\n00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,240\nAnd when I log-out, it should synchronize\nmy changes up to that network share.\n\n173\n00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,990\n>> Right.\n>> Okay.\n\n174\n00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,850\nNow, I did get that little warning\nmessage, it came and went really fast, so\n\n175\n00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,580\nI, I'll have to see what happened there.\n\n176\n00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,600\nBut I'm gonna jump over to IT Pro TV DC 2,\nthat, that server.\n\n177\n00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,606\nAnd let's see if anything\ngot copied up for me.\n\n178\n00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:04,180\nAll right, Ronny,\nyou made that on the E drive, right?\n\n179\n00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,680\n>> I did.\n\n180\n00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,290\n>> Oh, I see something.\n\n181\n00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,060\n>> What's that?\n\n182\n00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,115\n>> You you actually listed\nProfile instead of pro file\n\n183\n00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,680\n>> I spelled it wrong\n\n184\n00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,525\n>> Oh, the worst part about that its you\n\n185\n00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:18,905\nspecifically said I have to\nspell it right dam gummet I did\n\n186\n00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:19,745\n>> When I saw\n\n187\n00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:22,845\nthat I was like did I make a profile\n>> All right,\n\n188\n00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:27,395\nthere we go pro files okay so\nI fixed my typo and rinse and\n\n189\n00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:29,955\nrepeat all right so\nthat would be why we got that error,\n\n190\n00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:34,041\nnow we are going to get an error because\nI can't type my password, there we go.\n\n191\n00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,230\nAll right, so I'm gonna,\nI'm gonna re-do this, right?\n\n192\n00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,880\nSo I'm gonna log in again.\n\n193\n00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,100\nLogged in faster that time.\n\n194\n00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,740\nI spelled it right I imagine.\n\n195\n00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,390\nAnd, I still have my documents.\n\n196\n00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,470\nBut I do need to log out so\nmy data will copy up to the server.\n\n197\n00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,615\nSo let me go and log-out.\n\n198\n00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:48,760\nAnd now,\n\n199\n00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,280\nit should be synchronizing that data up\nto the server, assuming it can get there.\n\n200\n00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,010\nI can verify that back on the server\nif I go into this profiles folder and\n\n201\n00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,840\nsure-\n>> There it is.\n\n202\n00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,910\n>> Enough there is Don.v2 file.\n\n203\n00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,050\nNow, what is that v2 all about?\n\n204\n00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,820\nWell, user profiles changed between\nWindows XP and Windows Vista and\n\n205\n00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,540\nso it tracks the older profiles\nwith just your username and\n\n206\n00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,020\nthe newer ones with .v2 and\nit's part of this whole new roaming and\n\n207\n00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,620\nand in local-\n>> Yeah.\n\n208\n00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,960\n>> profile scheme that was\nused in Vista and higher.\n\n209\n00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,440\nBut I see that don folder was created,\n\n210\n00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,300\nwasn't there a minute ago\n>> Right.\n\n211\n00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,350\n>> Because I typed it wrong right, but but\nit is there I am now using that rolling\n\n212\n00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,890\nprofile if I browse into it I can see here\nis my desktop with that test document,\n\n213\n00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,770\nif I go into my favorites\nthere is that google link.\n\n214\n00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,897\nAnd if I go into Documents, there's the\nMission Critical Data & Network Diagram.\n\n215\n00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:39,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That was copied up to the server.\n\n216\n00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,960\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right?\n\n217\n00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,900\nNow I can move to any\ncomputer in my network, and\n\n218\n00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,280\nwhen I log in-\n>> Yep.\n\n219\n00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,960\n>> My profile will follow me.\n\n220\n00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,820\nThat's where the name comes from.\n\n221\n00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,030\n>> That's right.\n>> It roams.\n\n222\n00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,899\nIt follows you across\nthe different machines.\n\n223\n00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,170\n>> And it's roam, as in R-O-A-M.\n\n224\n00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,310\nNot R-O-M-E.\n\n225\n00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,010\nYou see a lot of people on the internet,\nthey talk about Roman profiles.\n\n226\n00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,260\nR-O-M-A-N.\n\n227\n00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,700\nI'm like, no it's not from,\nIt's not from Rome.\n\n228\n00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,720\nIt's not italian.\n\n229\n00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,900\nIt's just roaming, it travels.\n\n230\n00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,220\nSo so now, you know, any time I go and\nlog in, that's gonna follow me down.\n\n231\n00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,840\nNow, I can actually make changes\nright here if I want, so, like,\n\n232\n00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,980\nin my documents I could\nadd in some new stuff.\n\n233\n00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,760\nYou know, maybe I'm,\nI'm working on another computer, and so\n\n234\n00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,604\nI add in some documents\non that other computer.\n\n235\n00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:24,545\nAnd so this is just me adding some junk.\n\n236\n00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:29,825\nAll right, and the next time I\nlog in on that client computer,\n\n237\n00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:33,095\nthese will copy down to be\nright there on that computer.\n\n238\n00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,275\nAnd, and they literally do copy down so\nthey are stored so\n\n239\n00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:38,830\nthey are stored on that machine,\nwhich is important if you are on a laptop.\n\n240\n00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,835\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Then you go home and\n\n241\n00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:40,995\nyou can't connect to the network.\n\n242\n00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:42,055\nYou need your profile.\n\n243\n00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:44,670\n>> Yep\n>> So it, it does copy' em down.\n\n244\n00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,434\nAnd so, if I go into my documents folder.\n\n245\n00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:55,200\nWell, where did my, there we go.\n\n246\n00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,960\nIf I go into my documents folder,\nif I ever get there, there we go.\n\n247\n00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,500\n>> There we go.\n\n248\n00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,065\n>> Here's those documents\nthat I created on the server.\n\n249\n00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:02,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n250\n00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,830\n>> They copy down.\n\n251\n00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,150\nAnd when I say they copy down,\nI mean they're,\n\n252\n00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,250\nthey're right here in this hard drive.\n\n253\n00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,020\nI browse to C: > Users > Don.\n\n254\n00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,190\nThey're actually right here-\n>> In the documents.\n\n255\n00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,050\n>> In this folder.\n\n256\n00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,700\n>> Yep.\n\n257\n00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,300\n>> If I go offline,\nI'll still have access to these.\n\n258\n00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,440\nAnd if I modify them when I'm done and\nI log out, they'll copy up to the server.\n\n259\n00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,600\nSo if I say, if I start to\npopulate this with some data.\n\n260\n00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:35,570\nI'm just gonna put a bunch in here,\nsee how big I can make this file.\n\n261\n00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,040\nAll right so now it's a 49K file,\nand maybe I modify this one and\n\n262\n00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,780\nput in some data.\n\n263\n00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,330\nAll right, so\nnow those files now have data in them.\n\n264\n00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,900\nWhen I log out it's gonna synchronize,\nit's gonna copy those up to the server, so\n\n265\n00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,200\nagain, I'm not dependent on this machine.\n\n266\n00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,860\nKey thing to remember about roaming\nprofiles is that they download when you\n\n267\n00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,530\nlog in, they upload when you log out.\n\n268\n00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,880\nWhile you're running,\nthey don't synchronize at all.\n\n269\n00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,630\nSo if you're logged in to two computers at\nthe same time and you're making changes,\n\n270\n00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,120\nthose changes won't synchronize until\nyou log out and log back in again.\n\n271\n00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,620\n>> Yeah.\n\n272\n00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,760\n>> All right, so if I go up here\nI can see already on the server.\n\n273\n00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,300\n>> There it is.\n>> Those files now have their data.\n\n274\n00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,230\nIt's been copied out.\n\n275\n00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,280\n>> Mm.\n>> So really cool technology,\n\n276\n00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,200\nreally useful.\n\n277\n00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,760\nAnywhere you have shared computers.\n\n278\n00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,060\n>> Right.\n>> You see this in hospitals and.\n\n279\n00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,970\nIndustrial facilities, you know you see\nshared computers in those environments\n\n280\n00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,470\na lot, and\nroaming profiles are really handy.\n\n281\n00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,970\nAll right.\n\n282\n00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,690\nAll right, Ronny, can you think of\nanything else worth mentioning there?\n\n283\n00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,170\n>> No well, the only other thing is that\n\n284\n00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,360\nnorm profiles again really work\ninside of active directory networks.\n\n285\n00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,590\nLocal user profiles probably not going to\nset that up for roaming profiles to often.\n\n286\n00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,350\nSo just remember that.\n\n287\n00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,280\nThat's where where their benefit and\nuse is going to be.\n\n288\n00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,000\nSo, again context is key\nespecially on the exam.\n\n289\n00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,870\nMake sure you pay attention now.\n\n290\n00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,160\n>> You know, just, just on a side note for\n\n291\n00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,170\nthose of you that are a little\nmore adventurous.\n\n292\n00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,440\nI believe you actually can\nset them up on the local.\n\n293\n00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,300\n>> Yeah.\n>> Computer.\n\n294\n00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,830\nThe problem in a work group is\nthe permission side of things.\n\n295\n00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, you're 99% of the time.\n\n296\n00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,670\n>> Right.\n>> Every time I've employed it's\n\n297\n00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,400\nwith an act of [INAUDIBLE].\n\n298\n00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,160\n>> Right.\n>> That's the way you want it, but\n\n299\n00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160\nif you want to see,\nlet me just experiment here.\n\n300\n00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,530\nI, I want to see if this setting is,\n\n301\n00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,050\nis here I'm gonna go\ninto computer management.\n\n302\n00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,892\nWell, I'll try to, if it finds it for me.\n\n303\n00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:19,590\n>> [LAUGH] Whoa!\n\n304\n00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,910\n>> There we go.\n\n305\n00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,045\nSo that's not right, is it?\n\n306\n00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:24,810\n>> Su, the m, the MMC.\n\n307\n00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,730\n>> Oh, sh, let me, let me, okay,\nlet me go the old fashioned way.\n\n308\n00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,440\nManage.\n\n309\n00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,580\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and,\nand go in here.\n\n310\n00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,160\nAnd I believe in the local user.\n\n311\n00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,120\nIf we had a local user,\nI'll take Nathan here for example.\n\n312\n00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,910\nYeah it does have a-\n>> Yeah.\n\n313\n00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,720\n>> Profile tab.\n\n314\n00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,910\nYou could set a network share, but\nhere's the challenge you're gonna have.\n\n315\n00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,150\nWith work group computers,\n\n316\n00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,850\nyou've gotta make sure that the\npermissions are set on this network share,\n\n317\n00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,130\nin a way that those different\ncomputers will be able to get to it.\n\n318\n00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,500\nIf you've got a Windows home group or\nsomething like that,\n\n319\n00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,840\nthat's not such a big deal.\n\n320\n00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,050\nBut if you're just in\na straight up work group,\n\n321\n00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,390\npermissions really become a challenge.\n\n322\n00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,500\n>> Right.\n>> If you've using the active directory\n\n323\n00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,040\nit's easy.\n\n324\n00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,000\nRight.\n>> Cause they're all in the same domain,\n\n325\n00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,500\nthey share credentials, and\nit's very easy to get it working together.\n\n326\n00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,560\nSo while you can do it on the local\nmachine, it's not really a good idea.\n\n327\n00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,000\n>> Right.\n>> Right, so just keep that in mind.\n\n328\n00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,770\nAll right, well Ronnie,\nthat's all I got so if that's all you got,\n\n329\n00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,240\nwe'll go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n330\n00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,020\n>> That's it.\n>> Definitely\n\n331\n00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,250\nstay tuned as we continue to add in more\nobjectives with the January 2014 update,\n\n332\n00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,850\nyou'll see a series of one\noffs just like this one.\n\n333\n00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,159\nAnd we hope you guys enjoy them.\n\n334\n00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:37,084\n[SOUND].\n\n",

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:37,390\nGood morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening everybody, and\n\n6\n00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,310\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,190\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\naccompanied today.\n\n8\n00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,886\n>> Nathan Copeland.\n\n9\n00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:43,530\nHello Don.\n\n10\n00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thanks for having me on the show.\n\n11\n00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,590\n>> And if you have that sense of deja\nvu for our live viewers, this our,\n\n12\n00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,730\nwhat are we number three cuz I\nbotched up the original intro?\n\n13\n00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,430\nSo we're having a great\nday of botched intros.\n\n14\n00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,500\n>> So I think we went off\npretty well that time, though.\n\n15\n00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,950\n>> Yeah, let's go with it.\n\n16\n00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,761\n>> Let's run.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,760\n>> [LAUGH] Run while we can.\n\n18\n00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,750\nSo today's episode,\nwe're back on Windows 8,\n\n19\n00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,810\nas you guys know cuz you're here,\nthat we're on the Windows 8 show.\n\n20\n00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,720\nAnd we've got a really cool one today cuz\nwe're gonna tackle migrating user data,\n\n21\n00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,260\nwhich is basically how we get our\ninformation from one computer and\n\n22\n00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,260\nmove it over to another.\n\n23\n00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,930\nIt's something that we've all\nencountered at some point.\n\n24\n00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,029\nTypically, if you've\nbought a new computer,\n\n25\n00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:27,332\nyou've got to get your information off\nthe old machine to the new machine,\n\n26\n00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:29,920\nand so we're gonna take a look\nat those techniques today.\n\n27\n00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,032\n>> Yeah, and\nthings like reinstalls, right?\n\n28\n00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:38,176\nOperating system, if I've messed mine up,\nand can't really recover it or\n\n29\n00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:42,125\nit's taking lot of time, then I can\nquickly backup my user profile, and\n\n30\n00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:47,240\nsettings and reinstall windows and import\nthat stuff back and be up and running.\n\n31\n00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,016\n>> And if you're new to computers, right.\n\n32\n00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:53,168\nSo if you're just getting in the field,\nyou might not have experienced this, but\n\n33\n00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:56,299\nfor anybody who's been dealing\nwith Windows basically, for\n\n34\n00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,427\nmore than a few years,\nknows that when you get a new computer,\n\n35\n00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:01,439\non day one it's nice and fast, right.\n\n36\n00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,793\nYou're like, man this is a fast computer,\nI really like it.\n\n37\n00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,706\nAnd then, after a few months,\n\n38\n00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:09,540\nafter a few years,\nit progressively gets slower and slower.\n\n39\n00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,320\nAs we add new software,\nas we configure new features and\n\n40\n00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,650\nfunctions, it starts to\nkinda bog down a bit.\n\n41\n00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,220\nAnd, that's not really Windows' fault.\n\n42\n00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,830\nIt's typically the fault of a lot\nof the software that we load.\n\n43\n00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,310\nBut there's other things that happen,\nupdates that get added and\n\n44\n00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,450\nremoved and so on.\n\n45\n00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,170\nAnd so\nit's handy to just format your computer.\n\n46\n00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,820\nWipe it, reload the operating system fresh\nand clean, and it will breathe new life\n\n47\n00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,420\ninto your laptop or desktop, or whatever\nit is that you have, as it suddenly starts\n\n48\n00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,640\nto run a lot more faster cuz a lot of\nthe information is kinda cleaned out.\n\n49\n00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,840\n>> Yep.\nAnd a good thing with Windows 8,\n\n50\n00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,710\ntoo, cleaning things out is the reset and\nrefresh.\n\n51\n00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,785\nThrow that in there cuz\nthat's new to Windows 8.\n\n52\n00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:52,940\n>> Yep.\n\n53\n00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,161\n>> We talked about that last time,\nso we won't rehash that again.\n\n54\n00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, so I just thought about it.\n\n55\n00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,320\nWhen you're like, oh yeah,\nclean stuff out, it's like, well, refresh.\n\n56\n00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,120\n>> Reset and refresh is good,\nand either way, reset and\n\n57\n00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,650\nrefresh can leave some files behind.\n\n58\n00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,920\nYou may or may not want that.\n\n59\n00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,930\nA lot of people do want that.\n\n60\n00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,723\nWhat we're gonna do is, we're gonna look\nat some techniques today that allow us to\n\n61\n00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:18,940\nsave our data even if we\ncompletely erase the machine and\n\n62\n00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,266\ndon't have a true system image backup or\nanything like that to pull off of.\n\n63\n00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,184\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n64\n00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:27,820\nYep, so\nwe've got a couple tools to do that.\n\n65\n00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,503\nWe've got Windows Easy Transfer, and\n\n66\n00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:34,493\nwe have another one called\nthe User State Migration Tool.\n\n67\n00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:35,530\n>> Yeah.\n\n68\n00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,320\nAnd on the exam, you're not normally\ngonna see them written out, right?\n\n69\n00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,200\nWell, actually Windows Easy Transfer,\nthey normally write that one out.\n\n70\n00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,719\nBut sometimes they call it by its acronym,\nwhich is WET, W-E-T.\n\n71\n00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,308\n>> The User State Migration Tool, though,\nthey almost always just call it the USMT.\n\n72\n00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:49,811\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n73\n00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:53,685\nYep, and the Windows Easy Transfer,\nor WET, right,\n\n74\n00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:57,740\nthat's built into Windows,\nWindows 8, 7 and Vista.\n\n75\n00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,702\nThe User State Migration Tool,\nthat's part of the Assessment and\n\n76\n00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:06,445\nDeployment Toolkit, so\nthat's a free download from Microsoft.\n\n77\n00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:12,360\nI've already downloaded it before,\nit's on my machine.\n\n78\n00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,890\nSo, unlike WET, it's not included\nwith Windows, but it's free.\n\n79\n00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,640\n>> Well let's start out with WET, and just\nto set the expectation here at the very\n\n80\n00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,810\nbeginning, Windows Easy Transfer is\nexactly like its name says, easy.\n\n81\n00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,970\nIt's designed for\nthat kind of at-home, or small office,\n\n82\n00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,400\nhome office type user that just has one\nsystem they wanna move stuff over with.\n\n83\n00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,480\nAnd so we're gonna start with that one.\n\n84\n00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,070\nThe USMT is more advanced.\n\n85\n00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,400\nIt's designed for larger companies and\n\n86\n00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,020\nenterprises where you've got tons\nof laptops, or tons of desktops,\n\n87\n00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,440\ntons of machines and\nprofiles that you need to move.\n\n88\n00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,200\nAnd so it's a lot more hardcore,\n\n89\n00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,038\nwhich means they had to take\neasy out of the name, right?\n\n90\n00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,057\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll start with the easy one.\n\n91\n00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:57,225\nAll right, yeah, on my machine here,\nI've got a little\n\n92\n00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:03,493\ntest computer that we can run through\nthe Easy Transfer with on here.\n\n93\n00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:07,295\n>> So on, [COUGH] on this one,\n\n94\n00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:12,930\nI think probably the best thing to do\nthrough the Windows Easy Transfer is just\n\n95\n00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,830\ngo through it and we'll talk about it as\nwe go through and look at all the menus.\n\n96\n00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,460\n>> Let me throw a little basic information\nout first, before we dive right in.\n\n97\n00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,960\nNate mentioned that it\nis built into Windows.\n\n98\n00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,690\nRight?\nAnd so he's got his Windows 8 machine\n\n99\n00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,670\nfired up here, it's already got\nWindows Easy Transfer on it.\n\n100\n00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,370\nAll right, Windows 7 and\n\n101\n00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,260\nWindows Vista also had\nWindows Easy Transfer built right in, but\n\n102\n00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,820\nwith each version that Microsoft releases\nthey have to update the tool right?\n\n103\n00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,400\nSo when Windows 7 came out, the WET was\nupdated for Windows 7 from the version\n\n104\n00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,700\nthat was in Vista and then when we get\ninto Windows 8, they've updated it again.\n\n105\n00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,170\nSo just because it's installed doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's the latest version\n\n106\n00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,250\nunless you're on the latest OS.\n\n107\n00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,042\nSo, he's starting on a Windows 8 machine,\nand\n\n108\n00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:01,868\nthat means he's gonna have the latest\nversion of the WET on there.\n\n109\n00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:04,625\nIf your old machine is Windows 7, though,\n\n110\n00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,807\nthere's a little bit of extra\nstuff that we're gonna do, right?\n\n111\n00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:09,403\nAnd Nate, are we going to do that?\n\n112\n00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,748\nDo we have a Windows 7 machine?\n\n113\n00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:12,720\n>> I don't.\n\n114\n00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,082\n>> Okay, well, actually we can show\nthem on the Windows 8 machine,\n\n115\n00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:16,613\nit's actually pretty straightforward.\n\n116\n00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:18,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n117\n00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,720\n>> But just keep that in mind.\n\n118\n00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,830\nYou can always go and download the latest\nversion of the tool from Microsoft's site,\n\n119\n00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,982\nbut it is built in to the system,\nso we can just pull it from there.\n\n120\n00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:31,175\n>> Yep.\nAll right, yeah, here we go.\n\n121\n00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:33,890\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n122\n00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,370\n>> We can get it started.\n\n123\n00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,070\n>> So Windows 8 makes it really\neasy to find applications that\n\n124\n00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,208\nare installed, right?\n\n125\n00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,850\nSo Jason, can we pull up Nate's machine?\n\n126\n00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,790\nAnd let's go ahead and dig that up now.\n\n127\n00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,550\nIt's not on the Start menu.\n\n128\n00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,727\nWe're not supposed to call it the Start\nmenu, it's the Start screen, right?\n\n129\n00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:52,490\n>> Start screen.\n\n130\n00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,481\n>> So it's not on the Start screen by\ndefault, right, but you can search for\n\n131\n00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,285\nit pretty easily.\n\n132\n00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n133\n00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,923\nYep, and we can easily just\ntype in Windows easy trans.\n\n134\n00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,610\n>> [LAUGH] Helps if you spell it right.\n\n135\n00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,580\n>> Transfer, right?\n\n136\n00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,320\nThere it is.\n\n137\n00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,040\nWe just smash Enter, and\nit starts up our little wizard here.\n\n138\n00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,070\nLittle intro screen, right?\n\n139\n00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,290\nWe can just click past this.\n\n140\n00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,010\n>> Well, on that screen, and\nyou can't go back, can you?\n\n141\n00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,080\nIt was just highlighting some of\nthe information this is gonna get.\n\n142\n00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,520\nRemember, the point of this tool is to\nhelp you get your data off of one machine\n\n143\n00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,130\nso you can move it to another machine,\nor just to back it up, so\n\n144\n00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,270\nthat when you format this machine,\nyou can bring it back.\n\n145\n00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,490\nAnd this screen is just kinda highlighting\nsome of the stuff that we can get with\n\n146\n00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,640\nthe Windows Easy Transfer, right?\n\n147\n00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,820\nSo this is important.\n\n148\n00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,710\nWe've get our user accounts, right?\n\n149\n00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,415\nA lot of us, like me, I've only\ngot one account on my machine, so\n\n150\n00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,000\nthat's not too important.\n\n151\n00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,790\nBut, many people do where they\nhave separate accounts for\n\n152\n00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,020\ntheir children, husband and wife sharing a\nmachine, or whatever, and so Windows easy\n\n153\n00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,600\ntransfer can actually grab all of those,\ncan grab all of the accounts at once.\n\n154\n00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,161\nWe also have our My Documents, which\nis what most people care about, music,\n\n155\n00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:03,824\npictures Your email configuration,\nthat's pretty handy.\n\n156\n00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:07,050\nNow if you're using web-based email\nit's not all that big of a deal.\n\n157\n00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,830\nBut, if you're using\nlike Outlook Express or\n\n158\n00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,570\nMicrosoft Outlook it'll\nback up that information.\n\n159\n00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,670\nYour Internet Explorer Favorites,\noh, let me tell you, have you ever\n\n160\n00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,410\nencountered somebody when they lose\ntheir Internet Explorer Favorites?\n\n161\n00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,790\n>> Oh yeah, it's bad.\n\n162\n00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,468\nIt's the end of the world.\n\n163\n00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:21,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As far as they're concerned\n\n164\n00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,990\nthe Internet no longer functions.\n\n165\n00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,000\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\nMissed all their favorites and links,\n\n166\n00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,690\nyears of collecting those.\n\n167\n00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,850\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n168\n00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,780\nI used to make fun of that.\n\n169\n00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,200\nI used to say oh come on,\nI have ten shortcuts, who cares?\n\n170\n00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,790\nBut I think I'm up to 400 now so\nit's ridiculous.\n\n171\n00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,710\n>> Holy cow.\n\n172\n00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,763\n>> Yeah, but\nI don't know what your number is.\n\n173\n00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:42,630\n[LAUGH]\n>> 15 maybe?\n\n174\n00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,050\n>> Nice.\n\n175\n00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,545\nJust Google, that's it,\nGoogle's my only bookmark.\n\n176\n00:08:46,545 --> 00:08:49,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then some of the other things that\n\n177\n00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:56,490\nwe can get on there, we've got are videos,\nwhich can be pretty big sometimes.\n\n178\n00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,480\n>> Yeah, real big.\n\n179\n00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,780\nI mean I could really increase the size of\nthe easy transfer file, add those videos.\n\n180\n00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,730\n>> And\nthen Microsoft throws in the and more.\n\n181\n00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,670\nAnd more means it can actually\nget a lot of stuff that\n\n182\n00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,075\nwe specify as we customize it.\n\n183\n00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n184\n00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,870\nYep.\n\n185\n00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,509\nAll right, so thanks, Don for\nthat awesome run down of the intro screen.\n\n186\n00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:18,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, all right.\n\n187\n00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,800\nWe've got three ways that\nwe can transfer the easy\n\n188\n00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,270\ntransfer file from the old\nPC to the new PC, or\n\n189\n00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,770\nexisting PC if we're going to\nreinstall Windows, that sort of thing.\n\n190\n00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,340\nWe've got an easy transfer cable.\n\n191\n00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,730\nAn easy transfer cable is like a fancy\nUSB cable that directly connects to\n\n192\n00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,410\ncomputers through their USB ports,\nright through the network.\n\n193\n00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:50,560\nNow, using the network option, that's if\nthe PC you're moving to is already up.\n\n194\n00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,470\nIt's running.\n\n195\n00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,520\nAnd it will directly\ncontact that computer.\n\n196\n00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,300\nIt'll give you a little code.\n\n197\n00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,090\nAnd you type in that little code and\nthey'll talk to each other.\n\n198\n00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,620\nAnd it will back up the old PC and\n\n199\n00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,480\nsend it right over to the new one and\nget things up and running.\n\n200\n00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,400\nNow, if you are migrating to the same PC,\nif you're reinstalling Windows,\n\n201\n00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,720\nwhich is what I do a lot,\nI use the last option.\n\n202\n00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,610\nSo it's a external USB drive or\na flash drive, or something like that.\n\n203\n00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,910\nYou can then copy it to a network\nshare which will be good if you have\n\n204\n00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,778\na very large profile, gigabytes,\nterabytes of information\n\n205\n00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:33,350\n>> And I don't really have any flash\n\n206\n00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,890\ndrives that big, but-\n>> Yeah,\n\n207\n00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,632\nand hopefully your user\ndata isn't that gigantic.\n\n208\n00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:38,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean some people\n\n209\n00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,470\ndo have a large amount of data though,\nand they need that.\n\n210\n00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,504\nNow, of the three options each has its\npros and cons like Nate mentioned,\n\n211\n00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:49,945\nbut the theory is that that first\noption is the most convenient.\n\n212\n00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:51,917\nRight?\nIt says that Window's easy transfer cable,\n\n213\n00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,875\nyou take two computers, you hook\nthe cable between the two and off you go.\n\n214\n00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,065\n>> Have you ever used one?\n\n215\n00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:57,667\n>> I have never used one.\n\n216\n00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,904\n>> Have you even felt one before?\n\n217\n00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:00,134\n>> I have, actually.\n\n218\n00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:02,090\nLet me clarify that.\n\n219\n00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,640\nI was in a store and\nsaw it and picked it up and\n\n220\n00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,300\nlooked at it and it really is just\na cable with a little box in the middle.\n\n221\n00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,430\nIt's got USB ends on both sides.\n\n222\n00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,370\nAnd, the idea is, that you can hook\ntwo computers up with this cable and\n\n223\n00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,110\nnot have to mess around with networking,\n\n224\n00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,350\nnot have to mess around with any\nof that stuff or flash drives.\n\n225\n00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,450\nJust copies directly between the two.\n\n226\n00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,010\nThe problem is,\nthe cable is kind of expensive, right?\n\n227\n00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,880\nThey're like $40 I think.\n\n228\n00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,410\nAnd for a cable that you're probably\nonly going to use once, maybe twice,\n\n229\n00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,150\nit's not normally worth it.\n\n230\n00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,890\nThe other problem is the cable kinda\nchanged a little bit between Vista and 7.\n\n231\n00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,900\nAnd, so, now a lot of people,\nlike me, say, well, I don't want to\n\n232\n00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,840\nbuy one of these cables if it's not going\nto work in the next version of Windows.\n\n233\n00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,646\nAnd so you do have to be\na little bit careful about that,\n\n234\n00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:45,670\nwhether it's compatible with\nyour versions of Window's.\n\n235\n00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,398\nWhile it's marketed as\nthe easiest solution,\n\n236\n00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:52,947\nit's not something that\nmost of us ever use.\n\n237\n00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:55,153\n>> Now, USB can just go 15, 16 feet.\n\n238\n00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:59,029\nSo for that cable I mean you'd have\nto your PCs kind of close together in\n\n239\n00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,590\nthe same room, at least, right,\nrun that cable between them.\n\n240\n00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,590\n>> Let me, I'm gonna pull up\none of these cables and see,\n\n241\n00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,660\nthe one that I saw was not very long,\nit was maybe seven feet.\n\n242\n00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,190\n>> Right.\n\n243\n00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,850\n>> So\nlet me see if I can find a cable here.\n\n244\n00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,670\nHere is a USB 2.0, so\nyou'll have to have some patience.\n\n245\n00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,885\nWindows Easy Transfer cable,\nactually, it's not that expensive,\n\n246\n00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,040\nI'm on just Newegg here.\n\n247\n00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,920\nAnd see there's a low end brand here so\nit's not going to be the highest quality,\n\n248\n00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,130\nbut for something you only use once,\nwhat do you really care.\n\n249\n00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,040\nSo it looks like eleven bucks there,\nbut Belkin is a slightly better name.\n\n250\n00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,100\n26 bucks for theirs and it's eight foot.\n\n251\n00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,970\nSo these are not long cables.\n\n252\n00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,960\nIt is expected for you to have the two\nmachines right next to each other.\n\n253\n00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,210\n>> All right, yeah, sweet, nice.\n\n254\n00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,774\nAll right.\nWell, sweet.\n\n255\n00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:46,435\nSo, yeah.\n\n256\n00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:49,297\nNetwork and so the last option.\n\n257\n00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:50,870\nWhich is what we're gonna use today.\n\n258\n00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,290\n>> Yeah, and really the last option.\n\n259\n00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,590\nI don't know about you, Nate,\n\n260\n00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,670\nbut the last option's really the one\nthat I use all the time, anyway.\n\n261\n00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,050\nDump to a USB or a USB hard drive.\n\n262\n00:12:59,050 --> 00:12:59,550\n>> Yeah.\nYep.\n\n263\n00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,600\nAll right, yep.\n\n264\n00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,470\nSo we're gonna choose that one.\n\n265\n00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,960\nAnd, right, this is the old PC, right?\n\n266\n00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,090\nThe one that we are working on.\n\n267\n00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,800\nNow, the profiles I have on here,\nI built up for\n\n268\n00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,980\nthis little demo that we're going through.\n\n269\n00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,160\nAnd so the profiles are really small.\n\n270\n00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,110\nThere's not a whole lot in there, so\nit's going to go through kind of fast.\n\n271\n00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,720\nIf you have a profile that\nyou've been using a long time,\n\n272\n00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,440\nif you have a lot of files, this process\nhere could take quite a long time.\n\n273\n00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,490\n>> Yeah, and just keep in mind,\n\n274\n00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,490\nit's not actually copying anything\nright here, it's just scanning, right.\n\n275\n00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,850\nBut, a big profile, it's a lot to scan and\nit can take a while.\n\n276\n00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,930\nIt's just looking to see what files\nare present, what's available.\n\n277\n00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,430\nThere are some types of files\nthat can't be transferred, so\n\n278\n00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,860\nit tries to locate those and kind of get\nan idea of what's going to be there.\n\n279\n00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,550\nThe most important thing is\nthat when it's done here,\n\n280\n00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,580\nit tells you about how how big\nyour file size is gonna be.\n\n281\n00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,690\nAnd you can see at the bottom right there,\n\n282\n00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,100\nthe assessment is that this is\ngonna be 559 megabytes, right.\n\n283\n00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,018\nSo, if you're transferring via\na USB key or a USB hard drive,\n\n284\n00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:03,277\nthis is how much storage\nyou're going to need.\n\n285\n00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,089\n>> Yep.\n\n286\n00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,263\nNow [COUGH], so we're going to keep\nthe two profiles on here, right,\n\n287\n00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:15,242\nbut the shared items there, but that's\nother stuff, we can browse in there and\n\n288\n00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:19,546\nsee what exactly it's,\ncuz this file, it is kinda big.\n\n289\n00:14:19,546 --> 00:14:21,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n290\n00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,650\n>> Yeah, all the public stuff,\nwe can click on Advanced.\n\n291\n00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,790\nAnd you know, pick things.\n\n292\n00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,300\nSo not only are our profiles here but\n\n293\n00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,720\nwe can also get other\nareas on the hard drive.\n\n294\n00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,180\nThe downloads, well,\ndownloads is with the profile.\n\n295\n00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,680\n>> Yeah.\n\n296\n00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,530\nWell, this is that And More option we\nsaw back on the Intro Wizard, right.\n\n297\n00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,211\nSo.\n>> Yeah.\n\n298\n00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,470\nSo maybe you're like me and I always, so\n\n299\n00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,450\nfor those of you that hack into\nmy computer in your spare time,\n\n300\n00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,150\non my hard drive you can\nfind a C:\\software folder.\n\n301\n00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,450\nI almost always keep it there.\n\n302\n00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,240\nAnd that's where I keep the not set up,\nbut the install files,\n\n303\n00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,910\nfor the various software that I run.\n\n304\n00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,290\nAnd so I might want to back that up too.\n\n305\n00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,320\nHere's where I can browse and\n\n306\n00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,310\nselect it and then set that up\nas part of the easy transfer.\n\n307\n00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,140\n>> So it like installs\nthe stuff off the internet,\n\n308\n00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,860\nyou wouldn't just re-download it?\n\n309\n00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,150\n>> So, things that I have like a digital\ncopy of, like Office, right, so\n\n310\n00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,990\nMicrosoft Office 2013.\n\n311\n00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,600\n>> Oh, right.\n\n312\n00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,670\n>> So Microsoft sends that to\nme as a digital ISO and so\n\n313\n00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,170\nI store a copy right there in software,\nor some of the other things,\n\n314\n00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,070\nlike Quick Books, whatever it is that I am\ngoing to run that way, but you're right.\n\n315\n00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,670\nIf it's something like 7 zip, it's free,\nI'll just go and download it again.\n\n316\n00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,730\n>> Okay, right, all right, right on.\n\n317\n00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,280\nAlright, so\nwe'll just cancel out of this menu here.\n\n318\n00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,390\nAnd we will uncheck that so\nwe do not include it.\n\n319\n00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,160\nAnd we'll click Next.\n\n320\n00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,380\nNow a password, it's a good idea\nto put a password on there.\n\n321\n00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,477\nI mean it's,\nyour back at your entire profile and\n\n322\n00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,734\nit's all your personal documents and\neverything.\n\n323\n00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:52,729\nIf somebody, maybe at your house,\nit may not be that big of a deal, but\n\n324\n00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:57,558\nsomewhere else, if someone were to\nget this easy transfer file then\n\n325\n00:15:57,558 --> 00:16:02,640\nthey could restore it on their PC and\nhave An exact copy of your profile or\n\n326\n00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,250\nwhatever that you chose to back up.\n\n327\n00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,340\nSo we'll just add a password on here,\n\n328\n00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,910\nnow it gives us the option to choose\nwhere we're going to save it.\n\n329\n00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,024\nAnd I'm going to save it on\nthe computer that we are going to.\n\n330\n00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:25,524\nI'm going to click save and there it goes.\n\n331\n00:16:25,524 --> 00:16:27,799\nAnd so\nnow it's gathering those files together.\n\n332\n00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,029\nIt's creating the easy\ntransfer document and\n\n333\n00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:36,670\nsending it over the network to the second\nPC, and now look, it's already done.\n\n334\n00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,819\n>> Now, if you were copying\nto like a USB 2.0 drive, and\n\n335\n00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:43,906\nthis was a large amount of data we\ncould be sitting here for 20 minutes,\n\n336\n00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:47,993\n30 minutes, an hour, two hours,\nI've seen some pretty big profiles\n\n337\n00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:51,880\nover the years that people back up,\nso, it may take a lot longer.\n\n338\n00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,430\nNate's went really fast cuz again\nthese are just kind of sample\n\n339\n00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,680\nprofiles that he created.\n\n340\n00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,320\n>> All right, we'll click Next, it gives\nus a little report on what it did,\n\n341\n00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,180\nit finished it, gives us the little\npath of where we stuck it, and\n\n342\n00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,420\nwe'll click next and hooray.\n\n343\n00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,380\nIt's all done.\n>> We're done.\n\n344\n00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,660\nYep.\nSo, at this point, all of your data, well,\n\n345\n00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,200\nthe data that you selected,\ncuz you can deselect things.\n\n346\n00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,760\nSo, of the data that you selected, it's\nnow been backed up and it's been stored in\n\n347\n00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,040\nthe, you went to a network share, but\nit could have been to a USB key or\n\n348\n00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,140\nwhatever and it's all right there,\nself-contained.\n\n349\n00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,600\nIt's off your machine.\n\n350\n00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,660\nSo now you could format your machine or\nthrow your machine in the trash or\n\n351\n00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,148\nwhatever and not loose your data.\n\n352\n00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:33,808\nCan you pull, oh.\n\n353\n00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:39,475\n>> Well properly dispose of your\nelectronic at your local Eways facility.\n\n354\n00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,115\n>> That is a good point, you guys should\nturn into our Security Plus show where we\n\n355\n00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:44,910\ndiscuss that in more depth.\n\n356\n00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,445\nHigh degree of risk there.\n\n357\n00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:48,980\nNate, could you pull the files\nthat it made really quick,\n\n358\n00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,615\njust to show them what it looks like.\n\n359\n00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:51,248\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n360\n00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:55,305\n>> So, it dumped them on to a network\nshare, and or a USB key or whatever.\n\n361\n00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:58,130\nIt's the same files and\nyou can browse in and look at them, and\n\n362\n00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,560\nit actually just creates these\nlittle files that it stores.\n\n363\n00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,759\nAnd, your profile is\nreally jammed in there.\n\n364\n00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,420\nLike Nate mentioned, it's not secure\nunless you put a password on it, so\n\n365\n00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,790\nalways a good idea.\n\n366\n00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,040\nAll right, so you got your pull up?\n\n367\n00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,700\n>> Yep.\n>> And so there we go.\n\n368\n00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,500\nSo you can see it just says Windows\nEasy Transfer Items from Old PC and\n\n369\n00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,320\nthe file size.\n\n370\n00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,410\nNow it told us it was\ngonna be 559 megabytes.\n\n371\n00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,170\nDid you deselect the?\n\n372\n00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:24,860\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay.\n\n373\n00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,430\n>> Yep.\n>> So that made it a bit smaller.\n\n374\n00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,260\nAnd then it compresses it too, so\nthat makes it even smaller still.\n\n375\n00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,055\n>> Yep, all right, so now,\nwe are on the second computer.\n\n376\n00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:38,372\nBefore we got started, I meant to\nchange the desktop so it'd look, so\n\n377\n00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,070\nto make it look a little different.\n\n378\n00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,092\n>> Oh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n379\n00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:44,349\n>> So this is in fact a different virtual\n\n380\n00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:49,330\nmachine that we're using and\nthere's a little file.\n\n381\n00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,505\nNow to restore the profile, oh yeah,\nso I thought I'd go in here and\n\n382\n00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:59,545\nshow that, so we are logged in\nas Don Pezet on this computer.\n\n383\n00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:00,045\nSo here we go.\n\n384\n00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,334\nAnd [SOUND] we can just double click.\n\n385\n00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:05,425\n>> Now I don't,\nI don't recall logging in to that machine.\n\n386\n00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:06,179\nIs my password compromised?\n\n387\n00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,579\n[LAUGH] Maybe.\n\n388\n00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:13,590\nCan neither confirm or\ndeny these allegations.\n\n389\n00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,740\n>> I changed it so I can log in.\n\n390\n00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,055\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n391\n00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,830\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so there we go.\n\n392\n00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,210\nWe double click on the file.\n\n393\n00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,940\nIt opens up, asks for\nthe password right away.\n\n394\n00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,140\nWe can't see in there,\nwhat files or whatnot.\n\n395\n00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:26,681\nEnter that in.\n\n396\n00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:32,383\nNow it's going to open everything up and\nit'll show our little profiles here,\n\n397\n00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:36,297\nand now from here again,\nwe can choose to customize and\n\n398\n00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:41,200\nchoose what we want to restore\nfrom this Easy Transfer file.\n\n399\n00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,840\nWe're just going to leave it\nat the default selections.\n\n400\n00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,290\nWe'll click transfer and there it goes,\nand so now it's taken that file,\n\n401\n00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,390\nunpacking it and putting everything\nkind of back where it goes,\n\n402\n00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,280\naccording to how we left it\non the previous installation.\n\n403\n00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,820\n>> Yeah, so\nif you have one user account or\n\n404\n00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,190\nif you have five user accounts or, is\nthere a limit to how many user accounts?\n\n405\n00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,160\nI don' t think there is.\n\n406\n00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,670\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n\n407\n00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,090\n>> So anyhow,\nif you have a bunch of user accounts,\n\n408\n00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,800\nyou probably shouldn't have too many,\nthen you can dump them into the file,\n\n409\n00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,370\nyou can bring them right\nover to the new system.\n\n410\n00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,010\nIt's really pretty straightforward and\npretty easy.\n\n411\n00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,240\nThus the name, Window's Easy Transfer.\n\n412\n00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,070\nThe thing is you are gonna need either\nthat transfer cable, a USB hard drive or\n\n413\n00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,140\nflash drive with enough space\navailable to store your data or\n\n414\n00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,615\na little bit of networking knowledge,\nright?\n\n415\n00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:28,870\nTo be able to have\na networking share available,\n\n416\n00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,920\nmaybe have a NASBOX or\nsomething like that.\n\n417\n00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,530\nNow while that's running,\nI do want to show one more thing.\n\n418\n00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,550\nCan you switch back to\nyour original machine or\n\n419\n00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,200\nif that one's done we can use it.\n\n420\n00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,720\n>> Oh, yeah, this one finished.\n\n421\n00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,430\n>> Let's pull that machine back up.\n\n422\n00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,930\nSo here it finished.\n\n423\n00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,530\nI guess we can talk about this real\nquick before we jump into my sidetrack.\n\n424\n00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,340\nSo when it finishes, it let's you know\nit's done, and then you can choose to see\n\n425\n00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,630\nwhat transferred and\nit gives you a little message.\n\n426\n00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,100\nThis is a key thing here.\n\n427\n00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,940\nSee a list of apps that\nyou might need to install.\n\n428\n00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,520\nWindows Easy Transfer does not\nmove applications, right, but\n\n429\n00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,610\nit moves your files.\n\n430\n00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,140\nSo let's say that I had Office\n2010 installed on my old computer,\n\n431\n00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,140\nwhen we do the Windows easy transfer,\nit's going to move the office 2010\n\n432\n00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,770\ndocuments that I made, it's going to move\nthose over but it's not going to actually\n\n433\n00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,830\nmove office 2010, so I may need to install\nthat application on the new system again.\n\n434\n00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,270\nWindows Easy Transfer is just for\nyour documents,\n\n435\n00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,265\nyour data, not your applications.\n\n436\n00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:28,470\n>> Mm-hm, yep, good point Don.\n\n437\n00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,728\n>> You know I try.\n>> Yeah, thanks for sharing.\n\n438\n00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,062\n>> So choose that link,\ndo the see a list of apps.\n\n439\n00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,386\nOh, we didn't really\nhave anything installed.\n\n440\n00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:35,480\n>> Yeah,\nwe didn't have any apps installed, I know.\n\n441\n00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:35,990\nI know.\n\n442\n00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,020\n>> All right.\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n443\n00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,080\nDoesn't move applications.\n\n444\n00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,580\nJust data.\n\n445\n00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,170\nNow, the other thing I mentioned\nat the beginning of the show,\n\n446\n00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,380\nI said how Microsoft has released a new\nversion of Windows Easy Transfer with\n\n447\n00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,600\neach operating system that's come out,\nright?\n\n448\n00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,640\nSo, the version in Windows Vista is\ndifferent from the version in Windows 7,\n\n449\n00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,960\nwhich is different than\nthe version in Windows 8.\n\n450\n00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,390\nYou need to run the version\nof Windows EasyTransfer for\n\n451\n00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,390\nwhatever version of Windows\nis your destination computer.\n\n452\n00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,680\nSo if your new computer is running Windows\n7, then run the Windows 7 EasyTransfer.\n\n453\n00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,320\nThis is Windows 8 on the exam so we need\nto run the Windows 8 Easy Transfer wizard.\n\n454\n00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,250\nWell, what if your old computer is\nWindows 7 or Windows Vista, right?\n\n455\n00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,240\nWell, in that case, you need to copy\nthe Windows Easy Transfer from Windows 8\n\n456\n00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,220\nover to the old system, all right?\n\n457\n00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,710\nSo Nate, can you run\nthe Windows Easy Transfer again?\n\n458\n00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,210\n>> Yep.\n\n459\n00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,340\n>> So what you do is you go to your\ndestination, you go to your new computer,\n\n460\n00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,570\nso you've got this nice new\nWindows 8 machine, okay.\n\n461\n00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,550\nAnd you fire up Windows Easy Transfer and\nyou hit Next, and\n\n462\n00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,500\nthen you tell it, this is the, oh,\nwe're gonna do, we'll say an external.\n\n463\n00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,250\nYep.\nAnd then we\"ll say this is my new PC.\n\n464\n00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,130\nSo we're on the new machine.\n\n465\n00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,520\nAnd then it says,\nhave you already saved your old data?\n\n466\n00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,150\nWell, my old machine is Windows seven,\nso no, I haven't saved it,\n\n467\n00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,990\nbecause it doesn't have the right\nversion of Easy Transfer.\n\n468\n00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,350\nSo we'll go ahead and say no to that.\n\n469\n00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,510\nWhen you say no,\nthe wizard then gives you the option to\n\n470\n00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,600\ninstall Windows Easy Transfer\non the old machine.\n\n471\n00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,770\nSo it says do you need to install it?\n\n472\n00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,730\nIf you're running Windows XP or\n\n473\n00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,050\nWindows Vista, it tells us that\nwe'll need to install it now.\n\n474\n00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,480\nIf we're running Windows 7,\nit says well, Windows Easy Transfers is\n\n475\n00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,335\nalready installed, and you just need\nto do your Windows updates, right?\n\n476\n00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:25,520\nCuz it's getting updated through that but\nif my old machine is Windows XP or\n\n477\n00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,300\nVista, we can choose that link.\n\n478\n00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,931\nMy old PC is running Windows XP or Vista,\nand what it will do is it will offer\n\n479\n00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:36,740\nto copy the Windows Easy Transfer program\nto a USB flash drive or hard drive.\n\n480\n00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,279\nAnd then you can take that drive\nover to your old system and\n\n481\n00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:43,893\nrun the Windows Easy Transfer\nright off of that drive, and\n\n482\n00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:49,093\nthen it's running the Windows 8 version\nof the transferer on your older machine.\n\n483\n00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:52,453\nSo it can back up the files in the right\nformat for your new system and\n\n484\n00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:53,656\nbring them right over.\n\n485\n00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:56,871\nSo that's really important when\nyou're jumping between OSes You gotta\n\n486\n00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:59,505\nuse the right version of\nWindows Easy Transfer, the one for\n\n487\n00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:00,730\nyour destination system.\n\n488\n00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,010\n>> Hm, sweet.\n\n489\n00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,590\n>> I don't know if you've\never had to do that, but\n\n490\n00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,570\nthe most common scenario for using Windows\nEasy Transfer is when you do an upgrade,\n\n491\n00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,320\nbut you and I, we burn through OSs so fast\nwe're basically going same to same, but\n\n492\n00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,720\na lot of people out in the field they're\ngoing from an old OS to a new OS, and so\n\n493\n00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,929\nthat's a pretty common scenario.\n\n494\n00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,310\nAll right, well, sweet.\n\n495\n00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,510\nThanks Don, for sharing all that.\n\n496\n00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,230\n>> Well, you know, I try.\n\n497\n00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,580\n>> I appreciate it.\n\n498\n00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,300\n>> Well, I have my moments.\n\n499\n00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,240\n>> Let's log off this profile, let's\nsign back in and let's check it out and\n\n500\n00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,780\nmake sure that everything\ntransferred over.\n\n501\n00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,768\n>> Actually, it worked.\n\n502\n00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,743\n[LAUGH] You never know, Dan.\n\n503\n00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,059\n>> Well, I didn't.\n\n504\n00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,020\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe are on Don Pizet's little account here,\n\n505\n00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,580\nso we're just going to sign out.\n\n506\n00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,260\nSign out of this guy.\n\n507\n00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:05,253\nAll right, now on here it's at, we'll\nget into some of this stuff later, but\n\n508\n00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,720\nbecause it's for\nsomething that we're going to do later,\n\n509\n00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,170\nlet's say a computer joined to a domain.\n\n510\n00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,460\nSo, it's telling me that I have to\nchange the password, before going.\n\n511\n00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,900\nThis is unique to this situation, but\n>> There are times\n\n512\n00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,750\nin Windows where it will decide that\n>> You know, with an easy transfer\n\n513\n00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,350\nlike this, that your password had\nthe opportunity to be compromised, and so\n\n514\n00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,820\nit'll force you to change your password.\n\n515\n00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,780\nSo it's just a security measure,\nand as soon as he changes that.\n\n516\n00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,130\n>> Yup, all right, we're good.\n\n517\n00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,850\nAll right, now, it's booting up.\n\n518\n00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,440\nNow, even though we did do\nthe Windows Easy Transfer, Windows\n\n519\n00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,105\neight will still go through part of this\nlittle screen of getting things set up.\n\n520\n00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:51,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n521\n00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,390\n>> Now, on a clean fresh profile after\nit goes through this little thing,\n\n522\n00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,150\nyou'll go through and\n\n523\n00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,035\nyou'll pick like your color theme\n>> And do a bit more configuration.\n\n524\n00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:04,875\nBut since we've transferred the profile\nover, it's gonna skip all that\n\n525\n00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,415\nlater stuff, and it's just doing its\nlittle thing here behind the scenes, and\n\n526\n00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:11,650\nso, we'll fast forward past\nthat stuff as it gets.\n\n527\n00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:17,932\nAll set up and then we'll check it and\nsee if everything's where it needs to be.\n\n528\n00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:18,530\n>> All right, and it usually\n\n529\n00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,320\ndoesn't take too long as it kinda runs\nthrough these little advertisements.\n\n530\n00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,940\nIn the first episode of Windows 8,\nyou guys saw where we did the install and\n\n531\n00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,620\nthis same thing happened,\nand then, yeah, there we go.\n\n532\n00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,450\nSo it didn't ask us\nabout our color profile,\n\n533\n00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,130\nbrought that over from the other\nsystem And so we've got.\n\n534\n00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,730\nSorry for cutting you off there Don.\n\n535\n00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,080\n>> We've got your daisies.\n\n536\n00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,830\nRight, is that what those are?\n\n537\n00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,490\nDaisies?\n\n538\n00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,910\n>> Yeah, I mean to change screen but.\n\n539\n00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,700\n>> Daffodils, dandelions, what else?\n\n540\n00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,660\n>> And so we turn up, and\nthere's our file on the desktop.\n\n541\n00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,710\nGame codes that transferred\nover from the other PC.\n\n542\n00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,060\nBecause, they are important,\njust like your internet links.\n\n543\n00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,360\nYour game codes, and saves.\n\n544\n00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,120\nYeah, passwords.\n\n545\n00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,420\n>> So, the key thing here is all\nour data came over and it was easy.\n\n546\n00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,310\nRight?\nSo, Microsoft delivered on their promise.\n\n547\n00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,720\nWindows Easy Transfer, pretty easy to move\nyour data from one system to another.\n\n548\n00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,470\n>> Pretty slick.\n\n549\n00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,740\n>> And if you're just doing one machine,\nit's really the go-to tool.\n\n550\n00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,290\nI use it myself, it's a good go-to.\n\n551\n00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,405\nBut if you're doing a lot of machines,\nif I've gotta do 100 machines,\n\n552\n00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:21,850\n1,000 machines, well, that's a lot to go\nthrough over and over again on all these\n\n553\n00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,790\ndifferent machines, and that's where our\nnext tool comes in, which is the USMT.\n\n554\n00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,260\nBut looking at the clock we're\nkind of running up on time.\n\n555\n00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,756\nBefore we wrap it u,p do you have\nanything else to add on the, the?\n\n556\n00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:35,390\n>> Yeah,real quick, yeah so\n\n557\n00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:39,880\nusing one of those easy transfer you can\ngo from a 32 bit to a 32 bit machine.\n\n558\n00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,320\nYou can go from a 32 bit\nto a 64 bit machine.\n\n559\n00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,710\nBut you cannot go from\na 64 bit to a 32 bit.\n\n560\n00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,410\nYou can't go down.\n\n561\n00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,050\nIf you do need to go down you have\nto use the Windows 7 backup and\n\n562\n00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,460\nrestore feature to back\nup your information.\n\n563\n00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,250\nThat way, and\nrestore it without using that.\n\n564\n00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,780\n>> I did not know that.\n\n565\n00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,840\nI wonder why that is.\n\n566\n00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,180\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n\n567\n00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,660\nBut it was a note in there and I wrote\nit down to make sure I brought it up.\n\n568\n00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,750\n>> Can't go from a 64-bit to a 32.\n\n569\n00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,470\nI guess it doesn't matter so much anymore\nnow that almost everybody is going 64-bit,\n\n570\n00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:19,320\nbut I wonder what the requirement or\nchange or whatever it was that broke that.\n\n571\n00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,560\nIt's probably the registry.\n\n572\n00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,680\nYou know, cuz the registry's got that\nwhole division between 32 and 64-bit now.\n\n573\n00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:29,025\nMaybe not.\nI don't know, I'm just guessing.\n\n574\n00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:29,544\n>> Oh right, yeah.\n\n575\n00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:31,585\n>> [LAUGH] There's probably\nabsolutely no reason,\n\n576\n00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,967\nMicrosoft just did it to\nforce people to go 64-bit.\n\n577\n00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:37,815\n[LAUGH] All right, well anyhow, this is\na pretty good stopping point for us here.\n\n578\n00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:38,585\nLet's wrap it up.\n\n579\n00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:42,140\nWe'll take a five minute break,\nor however long break and\n\n580\n00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,760\nwhen we get back the wonderful\nworld of the USMT.\n\n581\n00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,840\n>> Yes.\n>> All right, ladies and gentleman,\n\n582\n00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,650\nstay tuned.\n\n583\n00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:52,602\nMore action packed adventure after\nthese messages from absolutely no one.\n\n584\n00:28:52,602 --> 00:28:55,735\n[SOUND]\n\n585\n00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:59,454\n[MUSIC]\n\n586\n00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:01,010\nAlrl ight, welcome back everybody.\n\n587\n00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,995\nSo, the world record\nlongest five minute break.\n\n588\n00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:11,360\n[LAUGH] So welcome back to the Windows 8\nshow, we are tackling a neat topic today.\n\n589\n00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,880\nIn the first segment,\nwe saw how to migrate our user data,\n\n590\n00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,260\nhow to move user data From one computer to\nanother using the Windows Easy Transfer,\n\n591\n00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,630\nor the WET utility.\n\n592\n00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:26,610\nNow, we're going to jump into the slightly\nmore advanced User State Migration Tool,\n\n593\n00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,195\nor USMT,\nas it is affectionately Known as and\n\n594\n00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:33,895\nget a chance to see how it works and\nwhat it does.\n\n595\n00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:38,195\n>> Yup, and recap, the USMT is something\ntoo you can download from Microsoft.\n\n596\n00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,905\nActually, you have to download it,\n>> Yeah.\n\n597\n00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,255\n>> It's not included.\n\n598\n00:29:41,255 --> 00:29:44,940\nIt's a free download,\nit's part of this Pack of stuff.\n\n599\n00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,480\n>> And\nI've got it pulled up here on my computer.\n\n600\n00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,880\nLet me show you guys.\n\n601\n00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,480\nAnytime I have to do it it's not\nthe most scientific method here,\n\n602\n00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,345\nI just go to Google.\n\n603\n00:29:55,345 --> 00:29:57,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And on Google I do a search for\n\n604\n00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,230\nthe Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit.\n\n605\n00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,300\nOr you can even just do a search for\nWIndows adk.\n\n606\n00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:08,380\nThe adk assessment and deployment kit,\nit's a free package or utilities\n\n607\n00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,200\nthat comes from Microsoft you can go and\ndownload it they don't charge you.\n\n608\n00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,430\nAnd it's got a bunch of utilities\nin it for all sorts of things.\n\n609\n00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,050\nLike it's got requirements checkers,\n\n610\n00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,000\nto see whether your system can run\na certain operating system, and\n\n611\n00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,030\nit's got other stuff on there really\nuseful for deploying Windows.\n\n612\n00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,880\nThis is not stuff that\na home user would need.\n\n613\n00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,330\nThis is stuff that an enterprise or\na corporate environment would need And so\n\n614\n00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,050\nit's not included in Windows.\n\n615\n00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,460\nSo, I just do a search for Windows\nAssessment and Deployment Kit and the very\n\n616\n00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,500\nfirst link that I got here was to download\nit, and you go there and download the kit.\n\n617\n00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,350\nNow, the kit has a ton of utilities in it.\n\n618\n00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,730\nBut for the exam,\nthere's only one that we care about,\n\n619\n00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,200\nwhich is the User State Migration tool.\n\n620\n00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,810\nUnfortunately, you can't\ndownload just that tool,\n\n621\n00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,030\nthey do make you download\nthe whole daggum thing.\n\n622\n00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,260\nSo we can go and download it,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n623\n00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,830\nIt's 1.16 MB, so it's not a massive thing.\n\n624\n00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:08,850\nAnd we can just save it But\nyeah, it pops up and\n\n625\n00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:14,041\nas you go through it you can\nselect which pieces of the ADK\n\n626\n00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:21,710\nthat you would prefer to download, so\nyou do have a little bit of flexibility.\n\n627\n00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,360\nAs to which, yeah, what you wanna keep.\n\n628\n00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,310\n>> In the install, it's really\nlike any other Microsoft product.\n\n629\n00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,960\nYou got your end-user license agreement,\nyou pick your folder, and\n\n630\n00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,350\nhere's what Nate's talking about,\nwhere you pick what you want to install.\n\n631\n00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,000\nSo we've got some options.\n\n632\n00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,010\nI may not want all the deployment tools.\n\n633\n00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,340\nI may not want that stuff.\n\n634\n00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,870\nI may just want the user\nstate migration tools.\n\n635\n00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:45,291\nSo I can check that off, now I've got it,\nand I can see that the estimated disk\n\n636\n00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:48,761\nspace required is 61 MB,\nwhich is pretty impressive, and\n\n637\n00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:53,679\nthat's because the tool kit that we\ndownloaded is really just a downloader.\n\n638\n00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,311\nIt didn't actually download\nall the various tools, so\n\n639\n00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:58,890\nyou pick what you want And\nthen, it'll install them.\n\n640\n00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,902\nSo, I'll get my little\nsecurity window there.\n\n641\n00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:02,630\nThere we go.\n\n642\n00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,260\nSo, it's just gonna pull it and load it.\n\n643\n00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,950\nNate has already downloaded it in\nhis machine that we're gonna use in\n\n644\n00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,190\nthe example, but\n\n645\n00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,410\nI just wanted to show you guys how you can\ngo right to Microsoft, download it today.\n\n646\n00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,560\nAnd off you go.\n\n647\n00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,260\n>> Well, should we get started?\n\n648\n00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,870\n>> Yeah, let's take a look at it.\n\n649\n00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,260\nAnd we'll switch over to Nate's\nmachine that's already got it.\n\n650\n00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,900\nJust remember, if it's a single-time\noperation, you'll really use the WET,\n\n651\n00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,595\nthe Windows Easy Transfer, but in bigger\nenvironments, this is the way we go.\n\n652\n00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:32,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n653\n00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,280\nYup, alright.\n\n654\n00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,140\nRight on.\n\n655\n00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,380\nWell, yeah.\n\n656\n00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,460\nWe'll go ahead and get started.\n\n657\n00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,580\nSo we've got the computer here\nthat we were using last time.\n\n658\n00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,430\nAll right, now what we'll do yeah,\nreal quick shortcut.\n\n659\n00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,399\nWindows key x cuz we, little fun commands.\n\n660\n00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,190\n[LAUGH] We need the administrative\ncommand prompt, and\n\n661\n00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,140\nthere's a quick way to get to it.\n\n662\n00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,720\nWe'll say yes, and here we go.\n\n663\n00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,800\n>> Now it does need to be administrative,\nright?\n\n664\n00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,100\nBecause you're gonna be\naccessing user profiles.\n\n665\n00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,490\nProfiles that aren't even yours, right?\n\n666\n00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,570\nCuz if you have ten users, you need to\nbe able to get all ten users' data.\n\n667\n00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,360\nSo that is why it has go administrative.\n\n668\n00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,760\nNate, one of the things you guys are gonna\nsee here in a second is the user\n\n669\n00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,926\nstate migration tool has some of the\nlongest command line parameters available,\n\n670\n00:33:19,926 --> 00:33:20,975\nunfortunately.\n\n671\n00:33:20,975 --> 00:33:23,715\nSo, can you bump the font size up on that?\n\n672\n00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,350\n>> You know, I was looking at it before.\n\n673\n00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,430\n>> Let's just make sure.\n\n674\n00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,720\n>> Is it in the font tab?\n\n675\n00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,470\nYeah, what I normally do,\nI'll turn over to my settings,\n\n676\n00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,850\nswitch to the Consolas font.\n\n677\n00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,630\nAnd set it to bold.\n\n678\n00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,180\nAnd then bump it up to a, try 36.\n\n679\n00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,113\nNow, we're talking.\n\n680\n00:33:46,113 --> 00:33:50,000\nThere we go, all right now, nice and\neasy to read for everybody.\n\n681\n00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,340\nAll right, so now,\nwe're gonna tackle that USMT.\n\n682\n00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,940\n>> All right.\n\n683\n00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,555\nRight on.\n\n684\n00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:54,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> First thing's first,\n\n685\n00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,360\nwe need to browse to the folder\nthat has the USMT files in it.\n\n686\n00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580\nSo we'll just switch over to that.\n\n687\n00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,620\n>> And this is the folder\nthat you installed it to\n\n688\n00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,750\nwhen you did the installation.\n\n689\n00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,900\n>> So there's all of our files.\n\n690\n00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,870\nNow, the first one is a scanstate,\n\n691\n00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:23,660\nand we'll look at some of the modifiers\nfor it, and there are a lot.\n\n692\n00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,980\nThe scanned state and\nload state is highly configurable.\n\n693\n00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,770\nAnd it can do a lot of stuff.\n\n694\n00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,410\nIt can pull over certain things,\nit can pull over everything.\n\n695\n00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,950\nReally depending on the company's needs,\non what exactly needs to be backed up,\n\n696\n00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,520\nI think it would be a good idea to at\nleast just be familiar with, you know,\n\n697\n00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,215\nsome of these.\n\n698\n00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,150\nJust be aware of what it can do.\n\n699\n00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,130\n>> Sure.\n>> For this example, we're not gonna use\n\n700\n00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:58,970\nhardly any of these and just the real\nbasic use of the tool for this example.\n\n701\n00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,620\n>> Now if you find yourself going, good\nGod, why are there so many options here?\n\n702\n00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,970\nUnderstand that the USMT is not\ndesigned to be user-friendly.\n\n703\n00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,580\nIt's not designed to be easy.\n\n704\n00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,150\nIt's designed to be highly flexible and\nvery scriptable.\n\n705\n00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,320\nThese are things that we would run in an\nautomation script so that you can run them\n\n706\n00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,400\nacross thousands of computers without\nhaving to directly interact, all right?\n\n707\n00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,810\nSo there actually is no\ncommand called USMT.\n\n708\n00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,690\nInstead it's made up of these two pieces,\nand\n\n709\n00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,395\nNate just brought up the first\none which is the ScanState.\n\n710\n00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:32,270\nScanState is designed to\ngather all of your data.\n\n711\n00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,100\nAnd then load state is\ndesigned to deploy it.\n\n712\n00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,160\nUnfortunately, the command line is\nvery similar between the two, but\n\n713\n00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,300\nthat little help document he just pulled\nup, doing scanstate slash question mark.\n\n714\n00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,990\nThat's pretty handy.\n\n715\n00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,400\nBut, if you're wondering where the GUI is,\nwonder no more.\n\n716\n00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,050\nThere isn't one.\n\n717\n00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,270\nIt's straight up command line,\ncuz it's designed to be automated.\n\n718\n00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:52,920\n>> Yep, sweet.\n\n719\n00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,730\nThanks, Don, for that.\n\n720\n00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,460\nI appreciate it.\n\n721\n00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,910\nAll right, so\nwhat we're seeing is real basic use of it.\n\n722\n00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,010\nStart off, type in scanstate and\n\n723\n00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,695\nthen we need to send it to a place,\nwherever we're sending it to.\n\n724\n00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:11,585\nThere's another computer running on\nhere that has a little network share.\n\n725\n00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:14,965\nWe're gonna send it there.\n\n726\n00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,605\n>> We could send it to a USB drive or\nsomething too, right?\n\n727\n00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,350\n>> Yeah.\nWe'd have to use a net use to\n\n728\n00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,320\nget it in there with their\nlittle drive letter.\n\n729\n00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,870\nAnd things.\n\n730\n00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,390\nBut yeah, it could.\n\n731\n00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:37,680\nAll right so we've got, so dc01,\nthat's the computer that we're going to.\n\n732\n00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,040\nUSMT is a shared folder that we have,\nand then we've got this %username%,\n\n733\n00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,970\nand that's like a variable type thing,\nand so whatever our profile is,\n\n734\n00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,990\nit's going to create a folder of that\nname and stick all the files In there.\n\n735\n00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,810\n>> And if you've never seen it before,\nWindows has a lot of variables like this.\n\n736\n00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,490\nThere's a ton of them that are built into\nthe system that are designed just for\n\n737\n00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,560\nthis purpose.\n\n738\n00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,160\nIf we're gonna automate this, if we're\ngonna run it across 1,000 computers,\n\n739\n00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,880\nthere's a lot of different users, right?\n\n740\n00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,570\nSo we can't just have the user's user\nname hardcoded right in the command.\n\n741\n00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,820\nWe use a variable like this, and so\nit's one command that will work for many,\n\n742\n00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,160\nmany users, right?\n\n743\n00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,210\nIf you're ever bored one day and\nyou want to see all the variables.\n\n744\n00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,330\nJust run the word.\n\n745\n00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:24,320\nCan you fire up another command prompt,\nso that we don't lose this one?\n\n746\n00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,275\nWhat you can do is from a command prompt,\nyou can just run set, S-E-T, and\n\n747\n00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:33,805\nwhen you run set it will give you the list\nof all the variables that are available\n\n748\n00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:34,405\nfor your system.\n\n749\n00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:38,235\nAnd you can reference any of these\nin the command line by saying %,\n\n750\n00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:40,205\nthe name of the variable, %.\n\n751\n00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:43,630\nAnd so somewhere in here you'll\nsee user name and logon server and\n\n752\n00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,380\nall that other good stuff.\n\n753\n00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,135\nIt's all in here.\n\n754\n00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:48,280\n>> Mm-hm.\nNice.\n\n755\n00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,830\nSweet.\n\n756\n00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,330\nThanks, Don.\n\n757\n00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:51,580\nThat's good.\n\n758\n00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,382\n>> So polite, Nate.\n\n759\n00:37:52,382 --> 00:37:52,895\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n760\n00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,450\nOh, yeah, I know. Oh, gosh. Thank you.\n\n761\n00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,530\nAll right.\nSo\n\n762\n00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,800\nwe're gonna use a couple\nof switches in here.\n\n763\n00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,660\nWe're gonna use the c switch, and this\nsays to continue if there are any errors.\n\n764\n00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,020\nNow since we are logged into this\nprofile it will get some errors, so\n\n765\n00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:12,090\nthe c just says, hey even if you get\nan error, continue trucking along.\n\n766\n00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:16,990\nWe're gonna use the o for overwrite,\nif there is an existing profile of\n\n767\n00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,870\nthe same name,\nit's gonna overwrite the old one and\n\n768\n00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:24,550\nreplace it with this new one and\nwe'll use the l for a log.\n\n769\n00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,400\nAnd we'll just call this scanlog.txt.\n\n770\n00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,605\nSo we'll just have a log, so\nfor anything that we need.\n\n771\n00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:35,871\nFor later.\nAll right, we'll press Enter, and\n\n772\n00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:40,570\nit'll start doing its thing,\ngathering all the profiles.\n\n773\n00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:45,358\nAnd behind the scenes, it's doing\nsimilar to the Windows Easy Transfer,\n\n774\n00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,180\ngetting all its stuff together.\n\n775\n00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,600\n>> Yeah, there's actually very\nlittle difference between this and\n\n776\n00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,480\nthe Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n777\n00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,490\nThere are a lot more command line options,\nso\n\n778\n00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,240\nthere's a lot more flexibility\nwith this utility.\n\n779\n00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,510\nYou can tell it to scan\nthe entire hard drive and\n\n780\n00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,230\nget every file that ends in .pdf.\n\n781\n00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,950\nYou can do fun stuff like that.\n\n782\n00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,070\nLike if you use AutoCAD and you don't\nknow where you saved all your documents,\n\n783\n00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,210\nyou can tell it to scan your whole hard\ndrive and pull your AutoCAD documents.\n\n784\n00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,990\nSo, really powerful stuff.\n\n785\n00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,840\nIt can take a while to run.\n\n786\n00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,210\nAnd it is a great idea to do\na log just like Nate did.\n\n787\n00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,730\nSo that text file, that scanlog.txt,\nif there's any errors encountered,\n\n788\n00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,635\nyou'll be able to find out what it is and\ngo and look at it.\n\n789\n00:39:27,635 --> 00:39:32,165\nNow the kinds of errors we might bump\ninto, Nate mentioned the most common.\n\n790\n00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:36,165\nIf you're backing up your own profile and\nyou're logged in right now,\n\n791\n00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,635\nthere's gonna be a conflict.\n\n792\n00:39:37,635 --> 00:39:41,940\nYou're gonna be holding certain files\nopen, and so it'll get some errors there.\n\n793\n00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,295\nThe other thing is, if you're backing\nup somebody else's profile, and\n\n794\n00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:47,568\nyou don't have permissions\nto their profile, or\n\n795\n00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:49,787\ndon't have permissions\nto certain documents or\n\n796\n00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,435\nif they've done file-level encryption,\nthose will generate errors, too.\n\n797\n00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:56,173\nAnd the scan log is\nthe best way to find it.\n\n798\n00:39:56,173 --> 00:39:57,830\nAll right, sweet.\n\n799\n00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,881\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n800\n00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:04,780\nIt finished up so we can jump over to-\n>> Before you go too far\n\n801\n00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,950\ncan you pull up that scan_log.txt\n>> Oh, yeah, sure.\n\n802\n00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,620\nSo, it did give us a little\nwarning message after it ran,\n\n803\n00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,710\nit said that there were some errors that\nwould have been fatal if we haven't used\n\n804\n00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,200\nthe slash C command, and so you can\njust go right into that text file and\n\n805\n00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,290\nsee what the errors were, and\nkinda get an idea of what's going on.\n\n806\n00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,925\nSo, here I can see on Nate's system\nthat It ran, so there's that.\n\n807\n00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:36,800\n[LAUGH] And then eventually it\ngets to the actual good stuff.\n\n808\n00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,810\nHuh, it said there were failures, but\nit sure doesn't look like there were any.\n\n809\n00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:44,510\nDid I miss something?\n\n810\n00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,320\nDid you see any?\n\n811\n00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,450\nBut let's try it again.\n\n812\n00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,840\n>> Well,\nmaybe I misread the prompt on the screen.\n\n813\n00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,215\nI thought that it said that\nthere were three errors.\n\n814\n00:40:53,215 --> 00:40:54,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n815\n00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:59,490\nYeah, I ran it a couple times before\ncoming in to make sure everything\n\n816\n00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,180\nwent smoothly.\n\n817\n00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,300\n>> Oh, so maybe they were N4 or something?\n\n818\n00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,300\n>> Well, yeah, but-\n>> They're not in your, you know,\n\n819\n00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,260\nI looked at this log before and\nit was just a bunch of hex codes and\n\n820\n00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,800\nit wasn't very reader friendly,\nbut they were at the bottom.\n\n821\n00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,670\n>> Well, if there is a critical error,\nthis is where it'll end up and you can go\n\n822\n00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,920\nlook and see what happened, and more often\nthan not it's going to be permissions or\n\n823\n00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,950\nsomething like that where\nit can't get the file.\n\n824\n00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,960\n>> Sometimes they're not critical.\n\n825\n00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,140\n>> Sorry, that's scan state.\n\n826\n00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,240\nOops, we did scan log.\n\n827\n00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,870\n>> Wrong file.\n\n828\n00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,540\n>> Wrong file.\n\n829\n00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,340\n>> Here we go.\n>> All right and yeah, so\n\n830\n00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,880\nit's all the stuff that it did.\n\n831\n00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,570\n>> Okay.\n\n832\n00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,950\nErrors are down here at the bottom.\n\n833\n00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,780\nReally easy to read.\n\n834\n00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,850\n>> Yeah, very convenient.\n\n835\n00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:44,200\nSo, you can see some of the ones though,\nlike failure while instantiating,\n\n836\n00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,240\nipost gather for plug in, blah, blah blah,\n\n837\n00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,360\nso something like that isn't really\ngiving us a whole lot of information.\n\n838\n00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,530\nIf it is a permissions type error though,\nit will actually say the path to what it\n\n839\n00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,090\nwas maybe it's a file, maybe it's a\nregistry here, whatever, scroll up a bit,\n\n840\n00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,260\nlet's see if we can find\nsome non plugin errors.\n\n841\n00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,700\nSee if we can find one\nthat's actually useful.\n\n842\n00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,160\nThere's some.\n\n843\n00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,267\nSo, you've got a read error 32 for\nc:/program\n\n844\n00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:15,850\ndata/microsoft/windows\ndefender/scans/mpdiag.bin.\n\n845\n00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,083\nSo, Windows Defender,\nthat's the anti-virus, and\n\n846\n00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:22,640\nthe anti-malware software that runs in\nWindows 8, that file is constantly in use,\n\n847\n00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,980\nit's always in use, and\nso it can't be backed up.\n\n848\n00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,280\nAll right, do we need to worry about that?\n\n849\n00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,095\nNo, no, that's That's not a critical\nfile we need to worry about that.\n\n850\n00:42:30,095 --> 00:42:32,235\nOn our other system,\nit's already got that file, right,\n\n851\n00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:33,465\ncuz it's built into Windows 8.\n\n852\n00:42:33,465 --> 00:42:34,315\nSo, it's not a problem.\n\n853\n00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:36,455\nSo, we just really need to scan over and\nlook for\n\n854\n00:42:36,455 --> 00:42:39,745\nanything like that that may have been\nmissed, that may be important to us.\n\n855\n00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:41,702\n>> Right, right on, sweet.\n\n856\n00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:43,072\nAll right.\n\n857\n00:42:43,072 --> 00:42:47,092\nSo, now that that's done let's,\nwe'll jump over to our other computer.\n\n858\n00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:50,892\nAll right, and so,\nwe're just gonna reverse the steps here.\n\n859\n00:42:50,892 --> 00:42:54,522\nSo, we'll pull up\nan Administrative Command prompt.\n\n860\n00:42:57,002 --> 00:42:59,967\nAnd we will browse, well,\nlet's pump the font up for Don.\n\n861\n00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,132\n>> [LAUGH] I'm getting old, Nate.\n\n862\n00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,372\nI can't wear my reading glasses\n[CROSSTALK] when we're on the show.\n\n863\n00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:05,875\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n864\n00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:09,530\n>> Although, you do.\n\n865\n00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,645\nWhen I wear my glasses on the show,\nthey reflect green.\n\n866\n00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:13,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n867\n00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,130\nOh, green?\n\n868\n00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,270\n>> Yeah,\nI think it's that anti-glare stuff.\n\n869\n00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,234\nDon't ever buy that.\n\n870\n00:43:18,234 --> 00:43:19,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When they tell you\n\n871\n00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,720\nat the optometrist-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n872\n00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,270\n>> They're like, oh,\n\n873\n00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,220\nyou should get the anti-glare, just say-\n>> Anti-glare.\n\n874\n00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,530\nYeah, trust me.\n\n875\n00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,340\n>> Right on.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n876\n00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,510\n>> Well, life lessons.\n\n877\n00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,110\n>> There we go.\n\n878\n00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,238\nA little added value.\n\n879\n00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:31,040\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so we're, yup,\n\n880\n00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,920\nwe're gonna browse back into, yup,\nthe folder now on this machine.\n\n881\n00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,570\nI have the scan state and\nload state tools on this computer.\n\n882\n00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,420\nIf you had it on some network computer,\nyou'd have to map to it, but\n\n883\n00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,590\nbrowse to that folder so\nit can load the tools.\n\n884\n00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:53,410\nNow, we will run loadstate this time, and\nwe gotta tell it where to load it from.\n\n885\n00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:57,615\nAnd this is on the share that we were at.\n\n886\n00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:04,940\nAll right and so now, yeah, you know what?\n\n887\n00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,870\nLet's jump over there.\n\n888\n00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:10,270\nLet's jump over to that computer\nwhere these files are stored, and\n\n889\n00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,110\nlet's take a look at where they're at.\n\n890\n00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,190\n>> Okay, and the files is kinda neat,\nthey actually do look different\n\n891\n00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:22,150\nthan the Windows EasyTransfer files did,\nand that's because they are kinda\n\n892\n00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,070\nsetting up to be able to back up\nmore than one user and all that.\n\n893\n00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,490\nSo, we'll see here USMT.MIG\nwhich is short for migration.\n\n894\n00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,640\n>> And you know,\nthe easy transfer's not on.\n\n895\n00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,250\nThis, this computer here.\n\n896\n00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:40,210\nYeah, but in MIG, if we had this on the\nother computer, we could double click it,\n\n897\n00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,560\nand it will launch Windows Easy Transfer.\n\n898\n00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,690\n>> But with USMT,\nsince the utility's not installed,\n\n899\n00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,500\nyou double click on it and, well,\nit doesn't know what to do.\n\n900\n00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,171\n>> Yup, it doesn't know.\n\n901\n00:44:48,171 --> 00:44:50,611\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so let's finish.\n\n902\n00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:53,610\nWe'll jump back to this other,\nother computer.\n\n903\n00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,180\nAll right, so\nThat's where we're loading it from,\n\n904\n00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,010\nand there are a couple\nof switches we'll use.\n\n905\n00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:06,080\nWe use the c switch to continue if there's\nany errors and we will use the lac switch.\n\n906\n00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,130\nNow, what this will do is create\nthe profile, if it doesn't already exist.\n\n907\n00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:17,210\nSo, if you're importing profiles and\nit's not already on here,\n\n908\n00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:22,080\nthis here will create that little profile\nspot and then dump all the stuff.\n\n909\n00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,220\n>> And that's an abbreviation for\nlocal account creation isn't it?\n\n910\n00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,230\n>> I believe so.\n>> Okay, so\n\n911\n00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,680\nit's just saying if that profile's in\nthere you've got to create the use and\n\n912\n00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,380\nit is a local user.\n\n913\n00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,120\nIn a domain environment, you should never\nneed that, but on a stand alone machine or\n\n914\n00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:39,650\nwhatever you may, and then,\nafter it's created it will be disabled.\n\n915\n00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:44,130\nSo we need the LAE for enable the account.\n\n916\n00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,590\n>> And you might ask yourself,\nwhy is it going to be disabled, and\n\n917\n00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,030\nthe reason is the password, right?\n\n918\n00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,270\nWhen it creates the account,\nit's going to have,\n\n919\n00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,530\nI think it actually gives it\na blank password, doesn't it?\n\n920\n00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:57,340\nAnd so it disables the account to make\nsure that somebody can't jump in there and\n\n921\n00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,078\ntry and use it.\n\n922\n00:45:58,078 --> 00:46:02,490\nBy doing L-E, local account enable,\nthat'll make it enabled,\n\n923\n00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:06,500\nbut we do need to make sure we go and\nchange that password.\n\n924\n00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:12,450\n>> All right, so we'll use the log,\nwe'll call this guy load log dot T-X-T.\n\n925\n00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,400\nThen we'll run it and\n\n926\n00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,330\nit will reach out of that server into the\nfolder and the stuff that we specified.\n\n927\n00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:23,920\nAnd pull that migration thing down,\nunpack it, and\n\n928\n00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,150\nput things back just how\neasy transfer did, but\n\n929\n00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,930\nthis way it's all scriptable so\nif we had a specific thing to backup and\n\n930\n00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:38,780\na specific way to put things back Then an\nadministrator can make little scripts and\n\n931\n00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,390\nstuff that people can just click on and\nit'll run and do everything for you.\n\n932\n00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,040\n>> Yeah.\nAnd for\n\n933\n00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,330\nthose of you that tune in on our Server\n2012 shows, we'll talk about group policy\n\n934\n00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,970\nobjects and we'll talk about group\npolicies even in this episode, too.\n\n935\n00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,330\nBut an administrator in an Active\nDirectory environment can write scripts\n\n936\n00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:58,270\nthat run anytime a computer starts up or\nshuts down.\n\n937\n00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,550\nSo you can actually make it where\nthe computers back themselves up with\n\n938\n00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,090\nthe USMT.\n\n939\n00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,130\nThe new system's deployed.\n\n940\n00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:07,010\nYou can make it when a user logs in, it\nautomatically brings that data back down.\n\n941\n00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,380\nSo, really cool functionality,\nespecially in the world of automation.\n\n942\n00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,980\nHopefully, at this point you can see how\nthis would be a super pain to use at home.\n\n943\n00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,820\nJust one a one time transfer.\n\n944\n00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,060\nBut in somewhere,\nwhere you're having to do this over and\n\n945\n00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,080\nover again for tons of machines.\n\n946\n00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,790\nThis is the way to go.\n\n947\n00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,930\n>> Yup, and yeah.\n\n948\n00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,450\nOnce again What we're using\nhere is just a really simple,\n\n949\n00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,210\nbasic use of the scan state and\nload state.\n\n950\n00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,340\nThere's others, XML files,\nyou can bring in.\n\n951\n00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,340\nThere's all sorts of things that it\nwould be a good idea to be familiar with\n\n952\n00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,110\nwhat it can do.\n\n953\n00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,290\nBut yeah, we're just using a real basic,\nbasic use of it.\n\n954\n00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,329\n>> All right.\n\n955\n00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:50,993\nLet's see,\nwhat else do we have on the USMT?\n\n956\n00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,407\nI think that's really about it, right?\n\n957\n00:47:52,407 --> 00:47:56,211\nI mean- Yeah, yeah,\njust run through it, and\n\n958\n00:47:56,211 --> 00:47:59,590\nshow kinda how it works and\nwhat it looks like.\n\n959\n00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:03,186\n>> Yeah, and and so, keep in mind\nthat this show, this is the first\n\n960\n00:48:03,186 --> 00:48:07,610\nof our Windows 8, MCSA shows and\nwe're really focused on that 70-687 exam.\n\n961\n00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:12,520\nThe 70-688 exam touches\nback on some of this.\n\n962\n00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,210\nSo stay tuned for that one.\n\n963\n00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,790\nThat'll be down the road,\nas soon as this show wraps up.\n\n964\n00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:19,710\nAnd and we'll take take a look\nat some of this stuff again.\n\n965\n00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,550\nBut from the basics, the,\nthe USMT, pretty straightforward.\n\n966\n00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,482\nWe did a backup here to a network share.\n\n967\n00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:27,409\nYou could have done the backup to,\nyou know,\n\n968\n00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:30,835\nyour USB key if it was drive letter F or\nwhatever, you could have done that.\n\n969\n00:48:30,835 --> 00:48:34,686\nBut basically a lot of\nthe same options as the WET,\n\n970\n00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:38,238\njust a little more complex\nbecause it is command line.\n\n971\n00:48:38,238 --> 00:48:38,888\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n972\n00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:44,154\n>> And and the ADK, the assessment and\ndeployment kit completely free.\n\n973\n00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,304\nYou can get it from Microsoft.\n\n974\n00:48:45,304 --> 00:48:49,339\n>> In the ADK it has a full set of\ndocumentation over the USMT and\n\n975\n00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:51,680\nhow all the various tags work.\n\n976\n00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,680\nSo if you wanna learn more about it,\nsome of the other tags,\n\n977\n00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,448\nit's, it's a great free resource.\n\n978\n00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:57,252\nYou can go out there and get it.\n\n979\n00:48:57,252 --> 00:48:59,920\nI, I can never remember\nthe Microsoft URLs, cuz they're complex.\n\n980\n00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,240\nI just do a Google search, you know?\n\n981\n00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,780\nWindows ADK, it'll turn up right away.\n\n982\n00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,741\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\nWell, yeah, I think that's all yeah for\n\n983\n00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:09,434\nthat.\n\n984\n00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:10,728\n>> Okay.\n>> Got it covered.\n\n985\n00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:16,000\nWe've you know, next we have\ncoming up our roaming profiles.\n\n986\n00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, so the you know,\n\n987\n00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,918\nprofiles aren't well they\nare kind of stored locally.\n\n988\n00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:23,965\nThey're also stored in another place.\n\n989\n00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:27,900\nSo yeah we wouldn't need to use WET or\nSMT.\n\n990\n00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,613\n>> Yeah,\nit's a much more advanced scenario.\n\n991\n00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:30,263\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But it, but\n\n992\n00:49:30,263 --> 00:49:31,746\nit is one we need to be familiar with.\n\n993\n00:49:31,746 --> 00:49:34,129\nLooking at the clock, we're starting\nto run a little low on time, so\n\n994\n00:49:34,129 --> 00:49:34,920\nwhy don't we do this?\n\n995\n00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,075\nWhy don't we stop here?\n\n996\n00:49:36,075 --> 00:49:37,111\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When we get back,\n\n997\n00:49:37,111 --> 00:49:40,420\nwe'll jump into roaming profiles, and\nand get a chance to, to see those.\n\n998\n00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,215\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n999\n00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:41,765\n>> Sound good?\n\n1000\n00:49:41,765 --> 00:49:42,545\n>> sounds good, Don.\n\n1001\n00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:44,120\n>> All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n1002\n00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,812\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n1003\n00:49:44,812 --> 00:49:52,793\n[MUSIC]\n\n1004\n00:49:52,793 --> 00:49:54,088\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1005\n00:49:54,088 --> 00:49:55,832\nSo in, in our last two segments,\n\n1006\n00:49:55,832 --> 00:49:58,460\nwe've taken a look at a couple\nof technologies, right?\n\n1007\n00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,150\nWe did Windows Easy Transfer, and we did\nthe user state migration tool the USMT.\n\n1008\n00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,930\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, good stuff.\n\n1009\n00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:05,650\nI like those.\n\n1010\n00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,474\n>> Yep, and.\n\n1011\n00:50:06,474 --> 00:50:06,981\n[LAUGH].\n\n1012\n00:50:06,981 --> 00:50:07,961\nThey're my favorite.\n\n1013\n00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:08,708\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So so\n\n1014\n00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:11,440\nnow we're gonna take a look at\nanother tool that's available.\n\n1015\n00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,869\nIt's a lot more advanced, right?\n\n1016\n00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:13,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1017\n00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,160\n>> And what it is, it's called a,\na roaming profile.\n\n1018\n00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,130\n>> Yep.\n>> And it,\n\n1019\n00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,610\nit goes a slightly different way, right?\n\n1020\n00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:25,778\nSo the USMT and the WET,\nthey give us a one time transfer of our,\n\n1021\n00:50:25,778 --> 00:50:28,380\nour profile and, and\nmove it to another system.\n\n1022\n00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,200\nBut a roaming profile, it,\nit's running all the time.\n\n1023\n00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,898\nIt, it's a repetitious thing where\nwe're constantly replicating our pro,\n\n1024\n00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,560\nprofile across different computers, right?\n\n1025\n00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,369\n>> Mm-hm, yep, and you know, and\nunlike the the first two roaming profile.\n\n1026\n00:50:42,369 --> 00:50:45,720\nIt involves storing your\nprofile on another computer.\n\n1027\n00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,705\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So now we're moving away from\n\n1028\n00:50:47,705 --> 00:50:53,120\nstoring all of our stuff locally, and now\ninvolving other people, other machines.\n\n1029\n00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,091\n>> So, you know, before we jump too far\nahead, Nate, why don't we why don't\n\n1030\n00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:58,882\nwe stop for a moment and, and talk about\nwhat the heck a profile is, right?\n\n1031\n00:50:58,882 --> 00:51:00,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz with Windows Easy Transfer and\n\n1032\n00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,000\nthe USMT,\nwe really don't care what a profile is.\n\n1033\n00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,135\nIt, it takes care of it for us.\n\n1034\n00:51:04,135 --> 00:51:05,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But with a roaming profile,\n\n1035\n00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,990\nwe really need to know what it is,\nall right?\n\n1036\n00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:13,270\nSo, in, in Windows 8, every user who logs\ninto your computer gets a special folder,\n\n1037\n00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,960\nand that folder is their profile, right?\n\n1038\n00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,768\nSo I, I'll pull mine up here on my,\non my computer.\n\n1039\n00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:20,617\nAnd, and, you know what, I,\nI've got all my like hidden files showing.\n\n1040\n00:51:20,617 --> 00:51:21,725\nSo this'll work out well.\n\n1041\n00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:22,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1042\n00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,070\n>> So, I'm just gonna browse in here and\n\n1043\n00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,185\non my C drive,\nI've got a folder called Users, all right?\n\n1044\n00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1045\n00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,520\n>> And in that folder,\n\n1046\n00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,610\nevery person who logs in on this\nmachine is gonna get a folder.\n\n1047\n00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:36,420\nAnd I, I'm the only one, so\nI've got the Don Pezet folder, right?\n\n1048\n00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,330\nSo that's my profile.\n\n1049\n00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,555\nAnd if I go into it,\nI'll see where I've got my downloads,\n\n1050\n00:51:41,555 --> 00:51:45,568\nmy desktop, my favorites, my,\nmy documents, my pictures, you know?\n\n1051\n00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:48,337\nAll the various things that\nmake up my personal data.\n\n1052\n00:51:48,337 --> 00:51:52,347\nAnd if I were to lose this computer or\nif I were to get a new computer, this is\n\n1053\n00:51:52,347 --> 00:51:56,645\nthe data that I would want, I'd would\nwant to bring with me to that new system.\n\n1054\n00:51:56,645 --> 00:52:00,189\nAnd so what we need to protect, and\nthis is exactly what the WET and\n\n1055\n00:52:00,189 --> 00:52:01,895\nthe USMT are backing up for us.\n\n1056\n00:52:01,895 --> 00:52:06,124\n>> Mm-hm, yep, and so the files that are\nstored in your profile are unique to your\n\n1057\n00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:08,094\nuser, your profile and your stuff.\n\n1058\n00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:09,073\n>> Mm-hm, absolutely.\n\n1059\n00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:12,530\n>> And other people, you know,\nwhen they sign in, they'll have their own\n\n1060\n00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,830\nfolder with their own things that\nwould be separate from yours.\n\n1061\n00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:19,510\n>> Right, and then there'll just be other\nfolders right here in this same folder, so\n\n1062\n00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,465\nit's c:/user/ insert person's name here,\nright?\n\n1063\n00:52:22,465 --> 00:52:23,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So so\n\n1064\n00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,500\nthat'll all just be, be right in there.\n\n1065\n00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,340\n>> Yep.\n>> So with a roaming profile, what we do\n\n1066\n00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:32,860\nis we basically take this folder and we\nsay, instead of storing the folder right\n\n1067\n00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:38,025\nhere on our own computer, let's store\nit on a network share somewhere, right?\n\n1068\n00:52:38,025 --> 00:52:39,620\nIt, usually on a server, right?\n\n1069\n00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,990\nBut it, it could be on a NAS box or\n\n1070\n00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,995\nsomething like that anetwork attached\nstorage, is, is what a NAS box is.\n\n1071\n00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:45,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n1072\n00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,125\nit could be stored on something like that.\n\n1073\n00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then when the computer fires up and\n\n1074\n00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:54,490\nI go to log in, it grabs a copy of my\nprofile from that network location,\n\n1075\n00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,920\ncopies it down, and I run from it locally.\n\n1076\n00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,630\nAnd then when I log off,\nit then copies it back up again, and\n\n1077\n00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:05,360\ncopies it right up to the server, and,\nand so now it's stored, and up to date.\n\n1078\n00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,860\nAnd every time I log in and\nout, it does that.\n\n1079\n00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,525\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, a good thing I think of\n\n1080\n00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:13,938\nhaving your profile stored on\na central location, a server.\n\n1081\n00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:15,839\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or a NAS, or, or something,\n\n1082\n00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,420\nis to have the ability to\nhave your profile backed up.\n\n1083\n00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,652\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it's not just contained locally.\n\n1084\n00:53:21,652 --> 00:53:25,386\nIt can be on another machine or\nit can be part of a nightly backups, or\n\n1085\n00:53:25,386 --> 00:53:26,940\na weekly backups.\n\n1086\n00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,278\nAnd, you know, and just to have you know,\nthat safe security of having it backed up.\n\n1087\n00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:34,160\n>> Yeah, yeah, and this is not\nsomething a home user would use, or\n\n1088\n00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,080\neven a small business.\n\n1089\n00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,768\nBut let me give you an example of,\nof something I've set up in the field.\n\n1090\n00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:39,630\n>> Oh yeah, please.\n>> I set this up for\n\n1091\n00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,880\na real estate agency once.\n\n1092\n00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,700\nWhere they had they had\nabout 50 real estate agents.\n\n1093\n00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,150\nYou know, they,\nthey'd go out in the field.\n\n1094\n00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:49,010\nThey'd sell houses all day, and they'd\ncome back to the office every now and\n\n1095\n00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,060\nthen to update their ML, what is it?\n\n1096\n00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,710\nMLS listings, or whatever they're called?\n\n1097\n00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,650\nYou know, all,\nall the housing listings and stuff.\n\n1098\n00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,550\nAnd they had 50 agents, but\n\n1099\n00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,650\nthere were never more than a handful\nof them in the office at a given time.\n\n1100\n00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:05,580\nAnd so they had a bank of ten computers,\nand when these, these agents would come\n\n1101\n00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,080\nback into the office, they would just\nsit down at whatever computer was free.\n\n1102\n00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,990\nThey didn't have a dedicated computer\njust for them, they had shared computers.\n\n1103\n00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:16,600\nAnd so, one of the agents might sit\ndown at computer one today, but\n\n1104\n00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,320\nthey might be on computer five tomorrow,\nand computer ten the next day.\n\n1105\n00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,750\nBecause their profile was being\ncopied up to a shared location,\n\n1106\n00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,910\nit didn't matter what\ncomputer they logged in on.\n\n1107\n00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:27,490\nIf they log in on computer number seven,\n\n1108\n00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,930\ntheir profile was copied down and\neverything was there.\n\n1109\n00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:34,380\nTheir My Documents,\ntheir Internet Explorer Favorites,\n\n1110\n00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,370\nall that stuff was right there as if\nthat had been their computer all along.\n\n1111\n00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:41,605\nSo, the roaming profile allowed us\nto share computers amongst users,\n\n1112\n00:54:41,605 --> 00:54:43,631\nbut they each still get their\nown personal experience.\n\n1113\n00:54:43,631 --> 00:54:46,443\n>> Mm-hm, now when,\n[COUGH] now when these agents,\n\n1114\n00:54:46,443 --> 00:54:48,533\nwhen they would log off their computer.\n\n1115\n00:54:48,533 --> 00:54:51,166\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Their profile that was pulled down,\n\n1116\n00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,610\nit remains on that, on that computer.\n\n1117\n00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:54,500\n>> A copy of it yes.\n\n1118\n00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,327\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n1119\n00:54:55,327 --> 00:55:00,414\nAnd then, you know, and work with it and\nmake changes and everything is you know,\n\n1120\n00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:05,014\ndone locally on the machine when the user\nlogs off and those settings are,\n\n1121\n00:55:05,014 --> 00:55:06,500\nare synced back.\n\n1122\n00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,124\n>> Yeah, and exactly.\n\n1123\n00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:09,800\nAnd so, you know, it does make log on and\nlog off take a little bit longer, right?\n\n1124\n00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,585\nMm-hm.\n>> Cuz it's got to copy those files down,\n\n1125\n00:55:11,585 --> 00:55:13,980\nbut but it is worth it in the end.\n\n1126\n00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,846\nNow when we set this up, you're normally\ngonna have a server in place, right?\n\n1127\n00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:18,608\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n1128\n00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:22,050\nit, it's typically going to be set up in\nlike an Active Directory environment.\n\n1129\n00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,160\nSo Microsoft Windows uses\nthe Active Directory.\n\n1130\n00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,130\nIt's a, a central repository\nwhere all your user accounts and\n\n1131\n00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,010\npasswords are stored.\n\n1132\n00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,954\nAnd so when people log in on ten\ndifferent computers, their username and\n\n1133\n00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,940\npassword are coming from\nthe central location.\n\n1134\n00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,052\nAnd if we want to set up roaming profiles,\nthat's where we start,\n\n1135\n00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:39,450\nis in that Active Directory.\n\n1136\n00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,986\nSo Nate you want to, you want to?\n\n1137\n00:55:40,986 --> 00:55:42,254\n>> Mm-hm?\n>> Take the helm here, and, and\n\n1138\n00:55:42,254 --> 00:55:43,593\nshow how to, to get that set up?\n\n1139\n00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:45,120\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, sure.\n\n1140\n00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:51,262\nI have a, a virtual machine here\nrunning Windows Server 2012.\n\n1141\n00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:54,890\nVirtual machine here as\na domain controller.\n\n1142\n00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:59,830\nSo, it's the brain of the whole thing,\nand here, we'll fire up this\n\n1143\n00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:05,340\nserver manager and it's go-to place for\nall your different tools.\n\n1144\n00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:09,150\nAnd what Donald's talking about,\nusers and computers, right?\n\n1145\n00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,990\nRight here?\nWe'll fire this guy up, and right here, so\n\n1146\n00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,810\nwe've got all of our user accounts.\n\n1147\n00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:20,260\nNow, this is a, built up for\nthis little test lab thing,\n\n1148\n00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:24,350\nso there's not a bunch of\nbuilt-in Accounts in here.\n\n1149\n00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,780\nThe one that we will be working with\n\n1150\n00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,030\ndown here is my little user\naccount I created for this.\n\n1151\n00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,570\nOpen this guy up and\ntheres all these tabs and\n\n1152\n00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,210\nwe'll dive into that later-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1153\n00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:40,230\n>> Episodes and shows and what not, but\n\n1154\n00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,000\nthe profile tab is where we are after,\nAand specifically,\n\n1155\n00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,430\nthis profile path up here at the top,\nwhere we will tell\n\n1156\n00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,850\nthe computer where the profile for\nthis user is going to be.\n\n1157\n00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:55,390\nRight.\n\n1158\n00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:55,925\n>> Right.\n\n1159\n00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:57,475\nWhen you do a dollar sign\nat the end of a share,\n\n1160\n00:56:57,475 --> 00:57:01,415\nit does hide it from browsers, but\nthere are still permissions on the folder.\n\n1161\n00:57:01,415 --> 00:57:05,345\nSo, if somebody browses in there, there's\npermissions assigned to each folder so\n\n1162\n00:57:05,345 --> 00:57:07,935\nthat only that user and\nthe administrators have access to it.\n\n1163\n00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:11,580\nSo, If somebody does get into it, it's\nnot like they have the run of the place.\n\n1164\n00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,420\nThey can't get into everybody's profile.\n\n1165\n00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,688\nThere are still file permissions.\n\n1166\n00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:18,720\n>> All right, yeah it is a little small.\n\n1167\n00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,350\nI did bump up the-\n>> It's just Windows.\n\n1168\n00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,300\nIt has that small font.\n\n1169\n00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,630\n>> So, we've got backslash backslash\n>> DC01 which is our server, and\n\n1170\n00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,950\nthen the folder where\nthe profile is gonna be, and\n\n1171\n00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,800\nit's profiles with a dollar sign\nat the end, and then the percent\n\n1172\n00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,050\nuser name percent, which you're familiar\nwith the one we used last time.\n\n1173\n00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:43,640\nAnd so whatever the username is gonna\nbe is gonna create that folder.\n\n1174\n00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,850\nClick apply and you can see it.\n\n1175\n00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:48,280\nFilled in that little variable\nwith our profile name.\n\n1176\n00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,590\nSo, Nathan, we'll click OK.\n\n1177\n00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,650\nAll right.\n\n1178\n00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,930\nSo, now it, now it's all set.\n\n1179\n00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:57,740\nSo the next thing we need to do\nis to log in with that user.\n\n1180\n00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,710\nAnd it'll dial out and-\n>> Yup, now one of the things Nate and\n\n1181\n00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:04,550\nI were talking about before the show\nis kind of this funny thing.\n\n1182\n00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:08,120\nHe was telling me man,\nit just wasn't taking effect for me.\n\n1183\n00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:13,150\nThere's actually been a setting or\nwhatever in Windows since NT4\n\n1184\n00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:18,410\nthe first time I saw it, when you assign\na roaming user Profile like this.\n\n1185\n00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:24,000\nThe first time that user logs in, they see\nthe setting but it doesn't take effect.\n\n1186\n00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,880\nSo, they log in and they basically get\nthe setting, and then they log out,\n\n1187\n00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,930\nand then they log in again, and\nthe setting actually takes effect.\n\n1188\n00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:37,170\nSo, just remember, when you turn on\nroaming user profiles you did need to log\n\n1189\n00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:42,080\nin and log out twice for it to actually\nbe fully functional, just the first time,\n\n1190\n00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,550\nand then after that user can just log in a\nsingle time, but for it to take effect it\n\n1191\n00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:51,020\nis two logins, and there's a handful of\nsettings in Windows that are like that.\n\n1192\n00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,440\nThis is one of them.\n\n1193\n00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:53,970\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n1194\n00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,790\nSo we've logged in for the first time, and\n\n1195\n00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:01,480\nlet's jump back back over to the little\ndomain controller where we run this stuff,\n\n1196\n00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,810\nand let's browse in to\nthe folder where it will be.\n\n1197\n00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:08,350\nWe'll just check and make sure that\nit's empty, nothing's in there.\n\n1198\n00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,110\nTheir profiles, and there you go.\n\n1199\n00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,140\nIt's all empty, right.\n\n1200\n00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,930\nAll right,\nwe'll jump back to the other computer and\n\n1201\n00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:18,408\ndo that second log on,\nlike you advised, Don.\n\n1202\n00:59:18,408 --> 00:59:19,335\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1203\n00:59:29,776 --> 00:59:31,520\n>> And that's it.\nShould be done.\n\n1204\n00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,420\n>> Should be done.\n\n1205\n00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:32,920\nRight.\n\n1206\n00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,870\nNow, you have your setting,\nyour profile is there, but\n\n1207\n00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:42,970\nif I remember right it doesn't\ncopies up until you log out.\n\n1208\n00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,100\nWe can find out.\n\n1209\n00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,266\nYou're nodding at me, so\nI think you already know.\n\n1210\n00:59:46,266 --> 00:59:49,290\n[LAUGH] Well let's see.\n\n1211\n00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,440\nLet's jump over there, and there it is.\n\n1212\n00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,980\nSo there's the profile.\n\n1213\n00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,060\nIt's in the little profiles folder.\n\n1214\n00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,720\nJust a minute ago, we saw it was empty.\n\n1215\n00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,010\nWe logged back in, now it's populated.\n\n1216\n00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:01,250\nSo we've got the nathan.v2, right?\n\n1217\n01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,195\nSo that is our roaming profile.\n\n1218\n01:00:03,195 --> 01:00:06,975\nIf we try to browse into it, we cannot.\n\n1219\n01:00:06,975 --> 01:00:11,825\nWhen the profile was created,\nit created permissions on it so\n\n1220\n01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:19,375\nthat only the creator of the profile, so\nNathan, can browse into it and read it.\n\n1221\n01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:23,745\nSo, I'm logged in to this computer as a\ndomain admin, and even I can't look at it.\n\n1222\n01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,630\nI can take ownership of it.\n\n1223\n01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,620\nYup.\n>> And browse into it,\n\n1224\n01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,530\nbut, it really shouldn't.\n\n1225\n01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:34,760\nIt's someone's profile and it's locked\ndown because it's somebody else's.\n\n1226\n01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,980\n>> Yeah, and that is something you can\noverride in a group policy object.\n\n1227\n01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,430\nYou can tell it what permissions you want\nto assign to the folders by default, but,\n\n1228\n01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,730\nright now,\nwe probably just wanna leave it be.\n\n1229\n01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,540\nNow, let's test it out, right?\n\n1230\n01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:51,271\nSo, Nate, you should be able to go back\nto that computer and on that computer,\n\n1231\n01:00:51,271 --> 01:00:55,859\nif you create a document on your desktop,\nor in your My Documents folder, or\n\n1232\n01:00:55,859 --> 01:01:00,735\nwhatever, when you do that, that document\nis being stored in your profile, and\n\n1233\n01:01:00,735 --> 01:01:03,746\nsince your profile is roaming,\nwhen you log out,\n\n1234\n01:01:03,746 --> 01:01:06,798\nit should be copied up\ninto your roaming profile.\n\n1235\n01:01:08,968 --> 01:01:10,669\nSo, he's just going to\ncreate a document here.\n\n1236\n01:01:10,669 --> 01:01:12,760\nMore game codes.\n\n1237\n01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,425\nAll your Steam activation codes.\n\n1238\n01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:15,460\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah.\n\n1239\n01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,700\nYup.\nAll right, so there we go, and\n\n1240\n01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,980\njust log out.\n\n1241\n01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,140\n>> And log out\n>> Now,\n\n1242\n01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:25,630\nif you stay logged in, that copy\noperation happens during login, logout.\n\n1243\n01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:27,770\nSo, if you're to log into a second\nmachine at the same time,\n\n1244\n01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:30,690\nit's not going to see that yet,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n1245\n01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:34,460\nBut normally you don't have one person\nusing more than one computer at the same\n\n1246\n01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,275\ntime, unless they're,\nyou know, extra talented.\n\n1247\n01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:38,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1248\n01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,860\nthe real multi-tasker, right.\n\n1249\n01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,310\n>> With some extra arms sewed on,\nor something.\n\n1250\n01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,700\nSo, what are we doing here?\n\n1251\n01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,315\nMoving over to another computer or?\n\n1252\n01:01:47,315 --> 01:01:50,640\n>> Yeah, I saved it and logged out, so\nwe'll go back over to that other computer,\n\n1253\n01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,680\nand what, you said you wanted to test it?\n\n1254\n01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,710\n>> Jump over to another computer and\nlog in as Nathan, right?\n\n1255\n01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:59,040\nSo, when you log in, you should have that.\n\n1256\n01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,891\n>> That document that you just\ncreated should be [CROSSTALK]\n\n1257\n01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:02,539\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n1258\n01:02:02,539 --> 01:02:04,130\n>> It should be.\n\n1259\n01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:07,170\nSee, I'm using my technical\nterm should which covers me in\n\n1260\n01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,010\nthe event that it doesn't work.\n\n1261\n01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:09,930\n>> Right, we'll sign up.\n\n1262\n01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:20,600\n>> And on this one, let's see,\nit should take effect right away.\n\n1263\n01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,700\nRight.\nI don't think you could do in\n\n1264\n01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,340\nthe log in and log out.\n\n1265\n01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,000\nActually, since the\n>> The first time you're on this computer,\n\n1266\n01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,720\nyou might have to do the log out thing.\n\n1267\n01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,025\nI guess we'll find out right here,\nwon't we?\n\n1268\n01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:33,300\n[LAUGH]\nYeah, it's kind of quirky, and if you've\n\n1269\n01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,770\ngot a bunch of people and a small amount\nof computers, it's not a big deal, but\n\n1270\n01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:39,100\nthe more computers you have,\nthe more quirky that can get.\n\n1271\n01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,030\n>> I would say it's probably working.\n\n1272\n01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,340\nCuz it is taking longer to log in, right?\n\n1273\n01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,530\n>> It is taking longer to log in.\n\n1274\n01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:47,350\n>> So, it's more than likely\ncopying that profile down, and\n\n1275\n01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,700\nwe'll know once you go to My Documents and\nsee.\n\n1276\n01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,520\nYou got your wallpaper.\n\n1277\n01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,570\n>> Yup, wallpaper's there.\n\n1278\n01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:56,753\nAnd let's browse into the documents,\nand there we go.\n\n1279\n01:02:56,753 --> 01:02:57,300\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Hey, look at that.\n\n1280\n01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,886\n>> Woo-hoo!\n\n1281\n01:02:58,886 --> 01:02:59,420\nIt works.\n>> Now,\n\n1282\n01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:02,440\nthe end result here is just like\nthe Windows Easy Transfer or\n\n1283\n01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,460\nthe User State Migration Tool, right?\n\n1284\n01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:10,390\nAnd the difference is those utilities web\nand usmt those are one time tools, right.\n\n1285\n01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:13,220\nThis is a constant on going thing,\n\n1286\n01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,890\neveryday when you log in\nit refreshes a profile.\n\n1287\n01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:19,620\nEveryday when you log out it copies it\nback up, so this person could go and\n\n1288\n01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,560\nlog in on multiple computers\nthroughout the day and\n\n1289\n01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,793\nalways have their same desktop,\nsame favorites, same everything.\n\n1290\n01:03:26,793 --> 01:03:27,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1291\n01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,920\nYup.\nNow apart from the documents saved in\n\n1292\n01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:38,470\nthere, using a Microsoft account, it kinda\ndoes a little bit of setting sync stuff,\n\n1293\n01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:42,170\nso you still get your Wallpaper in\nyour theme and that kind of thing.\n\n1294\n01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:46,937\nSo, a little bit more but the cool thing\nwith roman and grow files is that your\n\n1295\n01:03:46,937 --> 01:03:50,900\nprofile is stored And\non a central location server somewhere.\n\n1296\n01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:55,100\nAnd so it has the ability to be backed up.\n\n1297\n01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:59,913\nIf your computer, something were to happen\nto it all your files would be on another\n\n1298\n01:03:59,913 --> 01:04:03,170\nplace and have a little bit\nof data protection there.\n\n1299\n01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:03,685\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1300\n01:04:03,685 --> 01:04:04,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1301\n01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:08,463\n>> And if you are a corporation,\nand you've got tons of laptops that\n\n1302\n01:04:08,463 --> 01:04:13,227\nare out there, this can be pretty cool\nbecause if a user loses their laptop or\n\n1303\n01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:17,710\nwhatever, their entire profile\nis available on your system.\n\n1304\n01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:21,190\nIf they have a problem with their machine,\ninstead of troubleshooting it, you\n\n1305\n01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,230\ncan just send them a replacement machine\nand say, send me the other one back.\n\n1306\n01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,450\n>> They get the replacement machine.\n\n1307\n01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:29,110\nThey log in, and\nall their data is copied down.\n\n1308\n01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,610\nI mentioned laptops.\n\n1309\n01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:33,660\nWhat if you're at home and you're not\nconnected to the corporate network?\n\n1310\n01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,740\nWhen you log in, it will try and\nupdate it's profile but\n\n1311\n01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:40,680\nif it can't reach that server, it runs\noff of the locally copied profile so\n\n1312\n01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,460\nas long as you've logged in at least\nonce before it will have it and\n\n1313\n01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:46,670\nyou're able to get in and work so,\nit's a really cool functionality.\n\n1314\n01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1315\n01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,421\nYeah, you know, some of the more\nadvanced ways to kinda configure\n\n1316\n01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:58,110\nthings there is policy settings\nthat mentions primary computers.\n\n1317\n01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:03,010\nAnd so it can be that you can set certain\ncomputers as a primary computer so\n\n1318\n01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:07,660\nwhen you log in to another machine\nthat's not configured as primary,\n\n1319\n01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,920\nit won't pull your profile down.\n\n1320\n01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,670\nLet's say if you were to\nlog in to a kiosk computer.\n\n1321\n01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or just some machine for\n\n1322\n01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,450\na one time deal,\nit won't copy your whole profile and\n\n1323\n01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,510\nleave it on that person's computer.\n\n1324\n01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:28,555\nSo, there's, yeah, with policies there's\nmore things to configure and stuff.\n\n1325\n01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:30,337\n>> Yep, yep, and stuff.\n\n1326\n01:05:30,337 --> 01:05:33,385\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was kind of running out\n\n1327\n01:05:33,385 --> 01:05:35,435\nof the thought.\n\n1328\n01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:38,525\n>> So kind of progressing through our\ntechnologies here, we've got the WET\n\n1329\n01:05:38,525 --> 01:05:43,115\nwhich is suitable for one time transfers\nfor home users, Windows easy transfer.\n\n1330\n01:05:43,115 --> 01:05:46,745\nThen we had the user state migration tool,\nthe USMT which is better for\n\n1331\n01:05:46,745 --> 01:05:51,350\npeople who are trying to migrate hundreds\nor thousands of computers one time.\n\n1332\n01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:54,710\nThen roaming profiles,\nwhich is great when you have\n\n1333\n01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:59,190\nusers moving between computers where they\ndon't actually have an assigned system.\n\n1334\n01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:02,330\nAll right, the only other\nthing we haven't touched on is\n\n1335\n01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:06,015\nthe Folder redirection, right?\n\n1336\n01:06:06,015 --> 01:06:09,665\nAnd, what do you think,\nNate we have five minutes.\n\n1337\n01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:10,865\nI don't think that's gonna be enough time.\n\n1338\n01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:15,595\n>> Yeah, no, I was looking at it, there's\nnot enough time to cover redirection.\n\n1339\n01:06:15,595 --> 01:06:16,150\n>> Okay.\n\n1340\n01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,120\nLet's stop here and take a break then.\n\n1341\n01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,900\nAnd when we get back, we'll jump into\nfolder redirection, knock that one out.\n\n1342\n01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:27,520\nFolder redirection almost\nidentical to roaming profiles,\n\n1343\n01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,455\nwhatever we just talked about.\n\n1344\n01:06:28,455 --> 01:06:31,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Except it's just grabbing particular\n\n1345\n01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,160\npieces of the profile instead\nof the whole thing, so\n\n1346\n01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,809\nwe'll tackle that when we get back.\n\n1347\n01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:38,490\nAnything else to throw\nin on roaming profiles?\n\n1348\n01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,450\n>> No.\nWe're good.\n\n1349\n01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,710\n>> All right,\nlet's wrap it up here then and\n\n1350\n01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:46,607\nwe will see you guys\nback in a few minutes.\n\n1351\n01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:47,930\n[MUSIC]\n\n1352\n01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:52,861\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1353\n01:06:52,861 --> 01:06:56,255\nSo, we're gonna round up this\nshow talking about one of the,\n\n1354\n01:06:56,255 --> 01:07:00,175\nprobably the least most used of\nthe technologies we've talked about,\n\n1355\n01:07:00,175 --> 01:07:03,420\nwhich is something we\ncall folder redirection.\n\n1356\n01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:08,980\n>> You say least use, but\nI think folder redirection is really cool,\n\n1357\n01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:14,090\nand I thought about using\nit at my house for stuff.\n\n1358\n01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:14,897\n>> But you haven't yet have you?\n\n1359\n01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:15,481\n>> Well, I haven't.\n\n1360\n01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:17,710\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1361\n01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:22,630\n>> When preparing for this show I thought\nwow, folder redirection is really cool.\n\n1362\n01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:24,719\n>> It is cool,\nit's a neat thing, all right.\n\n1363\n01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,210\nBefore the break, we showed you\nroaming using profiles, right?\n\n1364\n01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:33,660\nAnd we showed how you can take\na person's entire profile and\n\n1365\n01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,470\nstore it somewhere else.\n\n1366\n01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:40,320\nWell, what folder redirection does,\nit takes that same exact idea and\n\n1367\n01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:45,390\njust makes it a single folder,\nan individual piece of that profile.\n\n1368\n01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:50,480\nSo maybe I just want my Favorites\nto be stored somewhere else or\n\n1369\n01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,680\nI just want My Documents to be stored\nsomewhere else, not my whole profile.\n\n1370\n01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,580\nJust the My Documents folder.\n\n1371\n01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,400\nFolder Redirection let's us do this.\n\n1372\n01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,860\nAnd there are some cool things\nyou can achieve with it, right?\n\n1373\n01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:07,790\nSo, let's say that you want every\nemployee in your company to have\n\n1374\n01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:13,410\na set of icons on their desktop or\na set of icons in their start menu.\n\n1375\n01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:15,740\nYou can redirect everybody's desktop or\n\n1376\n01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:18,090\nredirect everybody's start menu\nto a certain location, and\n\n1377\n01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,350\nthen you can control all the elements\nthat show up inside of it.\n\n1378\n01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:21,680\nIt's kinda neat.\n\n1379\n01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,790\nIt is a bit of an administrative\nhassle though,\n\n1380\n01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:26,650\nit gets overwhelming with all\nthe people that are in there and stuff.\n\n1381\n01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:28,710\nBut, even on a personal level,\non a smaller,\n\n1382\n01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:33,620\nlike at home if you have a network\nattached storage device, you can redirect\n\n1383\n01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:38,167\nyour My Focuments folder to that NAS and\nthen anytime that you write to or\n\n1384\n01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:44,710\nread from the My Documents folder, it's\nactually sending it over to the NAS box.\n\n1385\n01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:50,420\nRoaming user profile, the data doesn't get\nstored locally like it does with that,\n\n1386\n01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,910\ninstead it is stored\non the network device.\n\n1387\n01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:55,850\nSo it can slow things down a bit but\nif you've got a large My Documents folder,\n\n1388\n01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:58,980\nit's only gonna pull what you're\nactually opening not the whole thing,\n\n1389\n01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:00,060\nlike a roaming profile does.\n\n1390\n01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:01,655\nSo it's got it's uses.\n\n1391\n01:09:01,655 --> 01:09:02,281\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1392\n01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:08,822\nYeah, so if If you have a rather large\nprofile with large stuff both a, unlike\n\n1393\n01:09:08,822 --> 01:09:12,870\na roaming profile with folder redirection,\n>> Yeah.\n\n1394\n01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:16,770\n>> It's not pulling everything down\nevery time that you log on and\n\n1395\n01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:19,810\nit's not syncing everything\nback when you log off.\n\n1396\n01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:25,730\nSo, yeah, like Don said, you can pick and\nchoose what you're pulling down.\n\n1397\n01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,080\nYou just work with it right then.\n\n1398\n01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,350\nAnd you still get your files on a central\nplace for backup and have everything kind\n\n1399\n01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:38,670\nof stored off your machine for whatever\nreason or if you're roaming between.\n\n1400\n01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:40,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Different computers\n\n1401\n01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:44,370\nyou don't have to worry about leaving your\nprofile stored on someone else's machine.\n\n1402\n01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:45,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n1403\n01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:46,540\nSo let me show you an example.\n\n1404\n01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:51,025\nNow I'm gonna show you guys the easy right\ninside a Windows 8 way to set this up.\n\n1405\n01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:52,205\nThere's the more advanced way,\n\n1406\n01:09:52,205 --> 01:09:55,645\nwhich is to set it up with a group policy\nobject in the Microsoft active directory,\n\n1407\n01:09:55,645 --> 01:09:59,875\nbut that's really a server topic so we'll\nsave that for the server show, but for\n\n1408\n01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,070\nright now, I'm gonna show\nyou right here in Windows 8.\n\n1409\n01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,490\nIt’s really pretty easy to set up.\n\n1410\n01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,640\nI’m going to redirect my\nMy Documents folder, okay.\n\n1411\n01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,861\nRight now, if I were to go\ninto my My Documents folder,\n\n1412\n01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:13,020\noop, that is not my My Documents folder.\n\n1413\n01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,190\nSo if I were to go into\nmy My Documents folder,\n\n1414\n01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:18,360\nright now it’s being stored\ninside of my user profile.\n\n1415\n01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,170\nSo if I come in here and\ncreate a document.\n\n1416\n01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:27,700\nSo I'll just create a document here\ncalled Don's Document Of Destruction.\n\n1417\n01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,180\nSo there's my document.\n\n1418\n01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:33,550\nAnd if I were to browse on the hard\ndrive to figure out where that went.\n\n1419\n01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:38,330\nThat went into C:\\ I'll just\nbrowse into my C-Drive and\n\n1420\n01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:43,500\ninto users and into Don Pizette and\n\n1421\n01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,630\ninto my documents and\nthere's Don's document of destruction.\n\n1422\n01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:49,650\nSo, that's just where it went,\n\n1423\n01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:56,480\nthat's my normal profile sequence/user/Don\nPizette/mydocuments, so that's normal.\n\n1424\n01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,200\nIf I want to redirect it I just\nbrowse back up into my profile and\n\n1425\n01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,200\nif you pull up the properties of\nMy Documents, you can redirect it.\n\n1426\n01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,830\nNow, actually I'm skipping a step here.\n\n1427\n01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,900\nIf I'm gonna redirect it,\nI probably need a destination.\n\n1428\n01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,710\nI need somewhere else to put it, right?\n\n1429\n01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,700\nSo you know what?\n\n1430\n01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:16,366\nI'm just gonna create another\nfolder on my hard drive,\n\n1431\n01:11:16,366 --> 01:11:20,734\nso I'm gonna go on to my C drive and\nI'll just make a folder called,\n\n1432\n01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:24,880\nlet's see, I need a new folder called,\nI don't know, Test.\n\n1433\n01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,132\nAll right, so I have a folder called Test.\n\n1434\n01:11:26,132 --> 01:11:29,260\nThat's where I'm going to redirect it to.\n\n1435\n01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:34,400\nOr maybe I will call it\nDocuments Of Destruction.\n\n1436\n01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,420\nThere we go, all right.\n\n1437\n01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,890\nDocuments Of Destruction.\n\n1438\n01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:39,940\nSo, I want anything that goes in\nmy My Documents folder to go here.\n\n1439\n01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:43,103\nNow this is on my local computer,\nnot a whole lot of point in doing that.\n\n1440\n01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:48,046\nI could pick a network share and stick it\nthere, that would be even better, right?\n\n1441\n01:11:48,046 --> 01:11:51,061\nBut we'll do it right here\nbecause its straight forward.\n\n1442\n01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:56,207\nIf I go into my user profile again I can\npull up the properties of my documents,\n\n1443\n01:11:56,207 --> 01:12:01,747\nand in the properties of my documents,\nand favorites is the same way, downloads,\n\n1444\n01:12:01,747 --> 01:12:06,813\neach of those folders are the same way,\nwe do have a location tab right here,\n\n1445\n01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:11,780\nand under location, we can specify\nanother place for this to go.\n\n1446\n01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:12,780\nAll right?\n\n1447\n01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,300\nSo the default is listed right here.\n\n1448\n01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,630\nI'm gonna go to, find target.\n\n1449\n01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:20,930\nShoot, that's not what I\nwanted.h I'm just gonna type it.\n\n1450\n01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:22,040\nIt'll be easiest.\n\n1451\n01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:27,270\nAnd so I'm gonna redirect it to\nc:/documents of destruction.\n\n1452\n01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:31,010\nAnd if I just hit Apply, then it's\ngonna redirect over to that folder and\n\n1453\n01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,360\nthat folder is empty.\n\n1454\n01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,070\nSo it's always a good idea to say,\nmove, instead.\n\n1455\n01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:40,220\nSo, it'll move the current contents\nof your, My Documents, into location.\n\n1456\n01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,771\nAnd apparently,\nit's going to make me browse to-\n\n1457\n01:12:41,771 --> 01:12:42,595\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1458\n01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:43,602\n>> Pick it, again.\n\n1459\n01:12:43,602 --> 01:12:47,472\nSo, I guess I coulda saved\nsome time from typing here.\n\n1460\n01:12:47,472 --> 01:12:51,370\nSo, I'll just select that folder, and\nthen when I hit Apply it's gonna move it.\n\n1461\n01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:54,920\nNow, if you've got a lot of documents,\nthis could take a while.\n\n1462\n01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:55,600\nI don't, right?\n\n1463\n01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,780\nI just have that one.\n\n1464\n01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:00,610\nNow it is warning me here, am I sure\nI want to move all the documents?\n\n1465\n01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,830\nAnd then it says,\nwe recommend moving all of them,\n\n1466\n01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,500\nbut they are warning us that\nit will just take a while.\n\n1467\n01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:08,560\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nsay yes to that and it's going to do it.\n\n1468\n01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,910\nNow, it should happen pretty quick for\nme, and now I'm redirected.\n\n1469\n01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:16,650\nNow, how do I actually\nknow I'm redirected?\n\n1470\n01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,570\n>> I have an idea.\n\n1471\n01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:19,190\n>> How's that?\n\n1472\n01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:21,600\nYou could go back into\nyour user profile and\n\n1473\n01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,260\nyou can check to see if the My\ndocuments folder is in there.\n\n1474\n01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,710\n>> All right.\n\n1475\n01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:32,710\nSo here I went into the Don Pezet profile,\nand\n\n1476\n01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:35,930\nI see my documents, and\nI see Don's document.\n\n1477\n01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:36,689\nI'm gonna create a new one though.\n\n1478\n01:13:41,936 --> 01:13:43,781\nThis will be Don's second document.\n\n1479\n01:13:43,781 --> 01:13:50,540\nNow the trick is when we browsed in\nthis way that's not an actual path.\n\n1480\n01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:55,030\nWhen it shows, like, Don Pezet >\nMy Documents, if you click here,\n\n1481\n01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,560\nyou can see the actual path.\n\n1482\n01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,570\nAnd I can see that it's actually\nC:\\Documents of Destruction.\n\n1483\n01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:03,300\nSo visually, everything looked the same.\n\n1484\n01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,720\nI browsed into my profile,\nI browsed into my documents.\n\n1485\n01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,960\nSo your end user doesn't really\neven notice the difference.\n\n1486\n01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,300\nBut physically it did go\nto a different location.\n\n1487\n01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:18,200\nAnd like Nate said,\nI can browse just C: > Users > Don Pizet.\n\n1488\n01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,818\nAnd just like he said,\nthere's no My Documents folder.\n\n1489\n01:14:21,818 --> 01:14:22,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's gone.\n\n1490\n01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:25,450\nYeah, cuz it's no longer in your profile.\n\n1491\n01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:27,790\nIt is being redirected.\n\n1492\n01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,620\n>> Holy moly.\n\n1493\n01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:30,280\n>> To another folder.\n\n1494\n01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,930\n>> What a coincidence, and the technology\nis called folder redirection.\n\n1495\n01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:35,250\nYou'd almost think they\ndid that on purpose.\n\n1496\n01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:37,700\nSo now if I browse to my C drive.\n\n1497\n01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,090\nAnd oh, you know what?\n\n1498\n01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:42,340\nIt's actually being hidden from me,\nisn't it?\n\n1499\n01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:45,160\nYeah, it is being hidden.\n\n1500\n01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:45,660\nIt is there.\n\n1501\n01:14:49,496 --> 01:14:50,518\nIt's just being hidden.\n\n1502\n01:14:50,518 --> 01:14:52,902\nBut it's hidden cuz I\nput it in the C drive,\n\n1503\n01:14:52,902 --> 01:14:56,890\nwhich technically all users have\naccess to, so it's hidden it.\n\n1504\n01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:59,140\nBut it is there, so\nI just kinda type it in.\n\n1505\n01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:01,660\nAnd you'll even see here in the path,\nit's changed things.\n\n1506\n01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:06,180\nSo it shows C:\\My Documents, but\nwe know that it's actually C:\\Documents\n\n1507\n01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,270\nof Destruction, and\nif I click I can see that.\n\n1508\n01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,350\nAnd there's Don's Document and\nDon's Second Document, all right?\n\n1509\n01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:15,910\nNow [COUGH] Don, so\non over there under your libraries.\n\n1510\n01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:19,630\nIf you click on the documents over there,\nthat will take you right, okay yeah,\n\n1511\n01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:20,150\nit's right there.\n\n1512\n01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,440\nSo you don't have to type\nanything in cuz it's hidden.\n\n1513\n01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,950\nSo there you go.\nSo it's in your libraries and it works.\n\n1514\n01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:26,580\n>> And we are in business, yeah.\n\n1515\n01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:27,620\nSo really cool.\n\n1516\n01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:31,220\nYou know a neat feature, its also useful\nif likeyou're running out of hard-drive\n\n1517\n01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:34,210\nspace on your c drive,\nyou add a second hard-drive.\n\n1518\n01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:36,840\nInstead of trying to copy a bunch of junk\nover and figure it out, you can just\n\n1519\n01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,560\nredirect your mydocuments folder, or\nwherever the bulk of your stuff is.\n\n1520\n01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,296\nIt'll move it over to the new hard-drive\nwhere everything else stays on the old\n\n1521\n01:15:43,296 --> 01:15:45,210\nhard-drive, so, you know,\na lot of different uses for\n\n1522\n01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,530\nit, but it is pretty straightforward.\n\n1523\n01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:49,600\nIf you're just doing it for yourself or\n\n1524\n01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,280\nfor a single user,\nthis is the way to go about it.\n\n1525\n01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,572\n>> So, what about this?\n\n1526\n01:15:55,572 --> 01:15:58,670\nLet's say if we're offloading this folder,\n\n1527\n01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:02,630\nlet's say if we're in a business\ncorporate-type environment,\n\n1528\n01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:08,100\ncould we then place restrictions onto\nit to kind of control what people?\n\n1529\n01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,940\nHow much they save, what they save,\nand that's our thing as well.\n\n1530\n01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:15,680\nSo we can sort of keep tabs on\nwhat people are saving in there.\n\n1531\n01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,490\n>> Yeah, if you're redirecting to\nanother location on the same computer,\n\n1532\n01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,880\nthere's not a lot of point.\n\n1533\n01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,610\nBut if you're redirecting\nto a network share.\n\n1534\n01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:24,400\nNetwork storage.\n\n1535\n01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,349\nIf I can say it, jeez.\n\n1536\n01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:28,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then at that point you have a bunch of\n\n1537\n01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,020\npeople competing for\nstorage on the same device, and so\n\n1538\n01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,900\nyou may need to put some limits in.\n\n1539\n01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:37,530\nWindows 8, Windows Server 2012,\nthey all have what are called disk quotas.\n\n1540\n01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:40,370\nAnd a disk quota is where you can limit\nthe amount of space that somebody\n\n1541\n01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,190\nconsumes.\n\n1542\n01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:44,200\nWe actually talk about\nthat a little bit later on\n\n1543\n01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,950\nin our objective lists as far\nas Windows 8 is concerned.\n\n1544\n01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:49,090\nBut, its really going to come\ndown to where the data is stored,\n\n1545\n01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:52,230\nso if the data is being stored\non a server 2012 machine,\n\n1546\n01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:54,070\nthat's where you'd actually\nbe applying those quotas.\n\n1547\n01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:57,450\n>> Looks good, great example.\n\n1548\n01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:58,300\nThank you.\n\n1549\n01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,400\n>> I think that's really all I have\non folder redirection, how about you?\n\n1550\n01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,800\n>> Yeah\n>> Yeah, we should be good.\n\n1551\n01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,230\nI mean, you covered the basic uses of it.\n\n1552\n01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:09,890\n>> One other thing we\nmight wanna point out,\n\n1553\n01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:12,828\nis that there are some folders\nthat you can't redirect.\n\n1554\n01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:16,000\nSo, you know, a lot of them you can\nredirect, but if you go through and\n\n1555\n01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,890\nyou pull up the properties, like if I\npull up the properties for favorite,\n\n1556\n01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,670\noops, wow, I'm just clicking all over.\n\n1557\n01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:25,240\nIf I pull up the properties for favorites\nhere, I'll see I've got that location tab.\n\n1558\n01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,070\nRight?\n\n1559\n01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:29,560\nThere are some folders, like, let's see.\n\n1560\n01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,930\nWhat is one, is it contacts?\n\n1561\n01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:36,630\nNo, right.\n\n1562\n01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:40,300\nThe, oh, it may be just a hidden folders,\nlike if I turn on my hidden folders.\n\n1563\n01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,230\nSo there are certain folders like,\n\n1564\n01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:46,660\nI think app data is one of them that\nyou can't redirect to another location.\n\n1565\n01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,820\nIn that case if you wanna\nmove those folders,\n\n1566\n01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,340\nfolder redirection is not going to work.\n\n1567\n01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:51,760\nYou'll have to do a roaming user profile.\n\n1568\n01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,780\nSo, rewind back to the third\nsegment of the show and\n\n1569\n01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,780\nthat will be the approach\nyou have to go there.\n\n1570\n01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,460\nYep.\n\n1571\n01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,640\n>> Nice.\n\n1572\n01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,760\nWell yeah,\nI think that covers at least for\n\n1573\n01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,115\nthis first little bit about user profiles.\n\n1574\n01:18:04,115 --> 01:18:06,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> How to manage user profiles and\n\n1575\n01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:10,200\nto migrate user profiles\nfrom computer to computer.\n\n1576\n01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,440\nAnd how to, yeah, sew that stuff up.\n\n1577\n01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,280\n>> Excellent.\n\n1578\n01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,040\nAll right.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1579\n01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:19,120\nthat is all we have on\nMigrating User Data.\n\n1580\n01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,515\nSo we saw four different ways to do it.\n\n1581\n01:18:20,515 --> 01:18:22,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Tons of different things\n\n1582\n01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,300\n>> But that's basically it.\n\n1583\n01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,080\nThat's what we need to know for the exam.\n\n1584\n01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,460\nStay tuned.\n\n1585\n01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,690\nActually, we don't have\na Windows 8 episode tomorrow.\n\n1586\n01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:31,020\nWe've got one coming up though.\n\n1587\n01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:31,940\nSo stay tuned for\n\n1588\n01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:35,420\nmore episodes on Windows 8 as we continue\nto move through our exam objectives.\n\n1589\n01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,590\nAs always thank you for watching the show,\nwe hope you enjoyed it I'm Don Pezet.\n\n1590\n01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,760\n>> I'm Nathan Copeland.\n\n1591\n01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,550\n>> And we'll see you next time around.\n\n1592\n01:18:41,550 -->

00:00:39,590\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV!\n\n4\n00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,839\nLook it teamwork, woo hoo.\n\n5\n00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,438\n>> Come on, don't leave me hanging.\n\n6\n00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:45,182\n>> [SOUND] [LAUGH] So all right so\nI, I am here today and\n\n7\n00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:48,883\nlet me not forget I guess I need to\nintroduce myself, I'm Don Pazet,\n\n8\n00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,670\nyour host you guys probably know that\nby now and you probably know this guy.\n\n9\n00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,240\n>> Nathan Copeland, I am back again for\nanother Windows 8 deal.\n\n10\n00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,260\nThanks for having me back Don.\n\n11\n00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,240\n>> Yeah, hey, my pleasure.\n\n12\n00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,060\nAnytime we do a Window's 8 deal\nwe like to have Nate around.\n\n13\n00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,260\nSo, so, sorry.\n\n14\n00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,404\nSo today we've got an action packed,\n\n15\n00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:11,230\nadventure filled episode chock a block\nfull of driver on driver action, right?\n\n16\n00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,980\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,480\n>> Devices and their drivers.\n\n18\n00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,755\n>> Devices and their drivers.\n\n19\n00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:17,422\n>> Hm-mm, we gotta keep that part in.\n\n20\n00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:20,670\n>> So all right, so, so\nlet's let's jump straight into it.\n\n21\n00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,465\nActually, b, before I get too ahead of\nmyself, we are starting a new objective,\n\n22\n00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:29,410\nso for those of you guys studying for\nthe, 70-687 exam, which is most of you.\n\n23\n00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,430\nWe are jumping into our second objective\nwhich is configure hardware and\n\n24\n00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,910\napplications, and\n\n25\n00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,550\nit accounts for ten to 15% of the exam\nwhich is a pretty decent chunk.\n\n26\n00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,080\n>> Hm-mm, yeah, and\nyou know devices and drivers,\n\n27\n00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,120\nI mean it's something that you know,\nyou'd see a bit, a lot.\n\n28\n00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,440\nSo I mean it but field the test and a lot\nof stuff that you'll you know encounter.\n\n29\n00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,300\nDrivers and everything.\n\n30\n00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,040\nI mean it's stuff I see a lot as a driver\nproblems and issues and devices.\n\n31\n00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,565\nSo let, let's start real,\nreal high level here right and, and I,\n\n32\n00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:03,490\nI assume that most of our viewers have\nalready gone through like A+ or whatever,\n\n33\n00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,430\nbut, but if you haven't what,\nwhat the heck is a driver, right?\n\n34\n00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,370\nAnd a driver is, is just, it's just\nsoftware, it's software that somebody\n\n35\n00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,280\nwrote, hopefully somebody reputable,\nand it allows your operating system,\n\n36\n00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,220\nit allows Windows to be able to work\nwith the hardware in your computer.\n\n37\n00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,760\nUsually a specific piece of hardware.\n\n38\n00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,250\nSo you may have a driver for\na particular printer that you have.\n\n39\n00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,310\nYou may have a driver for\nyour hard drive controller,\n\n40\n00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,430\nyour motherboard, your sound card,\nyour mouse, your keyboard, all,\n\n41\n00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,870\nall these different components,\nI could rattle on all day.\n\n42\n00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,330\nYou need some kind of software that tells\nWindows how how to talk to that hardware,\n\n43\n00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,640\nand that, that's what a driver is.\n\n44\n00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,400\n>> Yep, [COUGH] and yeah, yeah, a driver's\nnow you know, a driver so you know,\n\n45\n00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,850\nbecause it you know, it let's Windows\ntalk to, you know, the hardware.\n\n46\n00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,955\nYou know, it runs in this,\nspace called a kernel space.\n\n47\n00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,960\n>> Um-hmm.\n>> And so, you know, what Don was saying,\n\n48\n00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,110\na reputable driver, it is important\nthat you know your drivers.\n\n49\n00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,740\nThey, if you unfortunately, if you know,\ngot a malicious driver from so,\n\n50\n00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,920\nsome third party, do an unsigned driver,\nthen it can you know, it can do you know,\n\n51\n00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,920\nbad things you know, let malware onto on,\nonto the system, so then having you know,\n\n52\n00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,710\na signed Microsoft driver because of the\nspace that it runs into you know, yeah, it\n\n53\n00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,500\n>> It's it's good for reliability and\n\n54\n00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,100\nperformance and everything.\n\n55\n00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,734\n>> Yeah.\nNow Nate, I,\n\n56\n00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:27,350\nI know it's not specifically called out on\nthe exam objectives, but do you think it\n\n57\n00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,200\nwould be worthwhile to talk about the how,\nthe hardware abstraction layer.\n\n58\n00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:31,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n59\n00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,540\n>> Yeah?\nSo, you know, and you can say no.\n\n60\n00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Be terrible, and\n\n61\n00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,350\nthis would be a lame show.\n\n62\n00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,890\nSo one of the things that I like to do\nthat I, I've learned over the years is,\n\n63\n00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,960\nthere's something that runs in\nthe background in Windows and\n\n64\n00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,610\nits called the HAL,\nthe Hardware Abstraction Layer.\n\n65\n00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,520\nAnd, a lot of people don't know about it,\nand\n\n66\n00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,280\nthat's a good thing cuz it's one of those\nthings you're not supposed to know about.\n\n67\n00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,250\nIt's just it runs in the background,\nit does its thing and\n\n68\n00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,770\nyou're not supposed to mess with it.\n\n69\n00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,530\n>> It's a really neat thing that\nwas introduced a long time ago.\n\n70\n00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,960\nIt was introduced back\nin the really in the NT,\n\n71\n00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,240\nlets say NT4 was when we really saw\nit reach it's it's full viability.\n\n72\n00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,130\nBut it's been in every\nversion of Windows since.\n\n73\n00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,240\nIn the really old days, right if we go,\n\n74\n00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,250\nwell let's go all the way\nback down memory lane, right?\n\n75\n00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,440\nIf I was sitting down at my 386 33 and\n\n76\n00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,360\nI was firing up Doom the brand new game\nthat just came out for the first time and\n\n77\n00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,350\nI wanted to play over\nthe network with Nate, right?\n\n78\n00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,770\nSo as we're going to fire up our\nmachines and play this whole video game,\n\n79\n00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,700\nwell Doom would need to\ninteract with my network card.\n\n80\n00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,850\nAnd so inside of the Doom\nprogram it had a support for\n\n81\n00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,530\nlike a whopping three network cards.\n\n82\n00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,240\nAnd if you had one of those three\nnetwork cards you were in business.\n\n83\n00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,290\nIf you didn't have one of those three\nnetwork cards, you weren't in business and\n\n84\n00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,280\nyou couldn't play, right?\n\n85\n00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,948\nSame thing with like if you\nfired up the old WordPerfect.\n\n86\n00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:49,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> WordPerfect 5.1 or whatever.\n\n87\n00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,240\nIf you wanted to print it had\nlike 30 drivers built into it.\n\n88\n00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,860\nAnd if you had one of those 30 printers,\nyou were in good shape.\n\n89\n00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,760\nIf you didn't, you couldn't print.\n\n90\n00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,360\nRight?\n\n91\n00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960\nSo back in the old days,\nevery software vendor,\n\n92\n00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,580\nevery programmer who wrote a program,\nthey had to also write drivers for\n\n93\n00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,540\nthe various hardware\nthey wanted to support.\n\n94\n00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,020\nThat meant that if you had some\ngreat new idea for a video game,\n\n95\n00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,090\nyou also needed to know how to program\nhardware drivers for a network card.\n\n96\n00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,580\nOr sound card drivers.\n\n97\n00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,970\nThat's why there were only like\ntwo sound cards back in the day.\n\n98\n00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,250\nBecause nobody wanted the write\ndrivers for different ones.\n\n99\n00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,970\n>> So wait, is that,\n\n100\n00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,130\nis that why everything had to\nbe Sound Blaster compatible?\n\n101\n00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,690\n>> Sound Blaster or Ad Lib.\n\n102\n00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,374\n>> Mh-mm.\nRight.\n\n103\n00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,742\n>> Huh.\n>> So you remember back, back in the day,\n\n104\n00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:28,540\ntho, those were the two big ones.\n\n105\n00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,342\nAnd there were other companies out\nthere like Turtle Beach and stuff.\n\n106\n00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:33,430\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> But they couldn't make headway cause\n\n107\n00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,630\nif you're a programmer,\nyou just wanna get your game out there.\n\n108\n00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,645\nYou don't wanna write a sound card driver.\n\n109\n00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,001\n>> Hm, huh, that's interesting.\n\n110\n00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:42,680\n>> So Microsoft introduced idea of\nthe HAL, the hardware abstraction layer.\n\n111\n00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,420\nAnd it completely changed\nthe world of drivers.\n\n112\n00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,140\nAnd that,\nthat's why I wanted to bring it up here,\n\n113\n00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,160\nis to kind of,\nI'm talking about something old, but\n\n114\n00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,960\nit's still very relevant in our,\nour modern OSs, all right.\n\n115\n00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,183\nThe other thing that the HAL, well,\nagain let, let me just start with the,\n\n116\n00:05:57,183 --> 00:06:00,140\nthe basic function of the HAL, then I,\nI'll give you guys the really cool part,\n\n117\n00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,790\nthe thing that sets it aside.\n\n118\n00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,040\nLet me, let me draw a picture.\n\n119\n00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,340\nI'm gonna get artsy today, right?.\n\n120\n00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,160\n>> Oh, I like this.\n\n121\n00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,270\n>> So,\n>> In the, in the old days.\n\n122\n00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,820\nWe'll go back to the olden\ndays of computing, right?\n\n123\n00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,205\nSo we might have a, a computer.\n\n124\n00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:16,760\n>> [COUGH]\n>> And, so this will be our computer.\n\n125\n00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,580\n>> Nice.\n\n126\n00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,100\n>> I know it's awesome.\n\n127\n00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,470\nThat's my computer.\n\n128\n00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,420\nAnd, in that computer we're gonna have\nvarious pieces of hardware, right, and\n\n129\n00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,270\nthat hardware it might be like\na hard drive, a sound card,\n\n130\n00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,700\na network card, right?\n\n131\n00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,430\nThese are all different things\nthat we find inside of a computer,\n\n132\n00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,700\nor you know,\nshould find inside a computer.\n\n133\n00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,970\nYou know,\nit would be nice if it would let me\n\n134\n00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,400\n>> There it goes.\n\n135\n00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,030\n>> Type right there.\n\n136\n00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,060\nOh, there it goes.\n\n137\n00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,510\nA little off kilter, but\nI'll straighten that out in a second.\n\n138\n00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,150\nSo, anyhow, we have all this various\nhardware inside of our computer and\n\n139\n00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,170\nit's great, right?\n\n140\n00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,630\nSo sorry I need my network card.\n\n141\n00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,550\nThere we go.\n\n142\n00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,270\nAll right.\n\n143\n00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,270\nSo, in the olden days of computing,\nwhen you ran a program, right?\n\n144\n00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,340\nYou had your operating system and so\nyou would have an an OS like DOS or\n\n145\n00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,944\nWindows you know,\n3.1 which really ran on top of DOS.\n\n146\n00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:15,506\nSo you'd have the, the operating\nsystem and when you ran a program,\n\n147\n00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:18,966\nlike if you ran Doom,\nright, the, the video game,\n\n148\n00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:22,130\nthat's what I was using\nas my example earlier.\n\n149\n00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,553\nIf you launched a video game, it really\nkind of took the place of your operating\n\n150\n00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:30,640\nsystem and took over access to all of\nyour hardware and stuff like that and\n\n151\n00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,253\nthat was one of the reasons\nwhy in the old days,\n\n152\n00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,090\nyou could only run one\nprogram at a a time, right?\n\n153\n00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,650\nYou didn't have multi taking,\nbecause that one program would run,\n\n154\n00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,480\nit'd take over the access to the hardware.\n\n155\n00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,270\nAll right?\n\n156\n00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,239\nWhen we started getting multi-tasking,\nwhen we got something like Windows, right,\n\n157\n00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:48,579\nWindows 3.1 or whatever, you could\nrun more than one program at once.\n\n158\n00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:54,238\nBut when you ran your software,\nthat software that was now running right\n\n159\n00:07:54,238 --> 00:08:00,103\non top of your operating system Well,\n[LAUGH] If I can click on these things.\n\n160\n00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:06,873\nNow, it's started to run on top of the OS.\n\n161\n00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:08,070\nIf I can find my pencil.\n\n162\n00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,322\nThere we go.\n\n163\n00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,910\nSo, we have our operating system, and our\nsoftware would run right on top of that.\n\n164\n00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,701\nWell, you could run more than one program\nat once, but when that program ran like,\n\n165\n00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:19,213\nmaybe I have a video game.\n\n166\n00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:23,691\nIf I can spell.\n\n167\n00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:28,497\nThat's gonna be my challenge\ntoday is simple spelling, and\n\n168\n00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:30,769\nI might have an mp3 player.\n\n169\n00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,092\nPeople used to use those.\n\n170\n00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:32,929\nRight?\n\n171\n00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,996\n>> Yeah, MP3 player.\n\n172\n00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:37,745\n>> And I'm trying to remember the one,\nthat everybody ran.\n\n173\n00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:38,720\n>> The Zune?\n\n174\n00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,916\nShoot, it had the little lightening bolt,\nlike a Zune.\n\n175\n00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,749\n>> Oh, a Winamp.\n\n176\n00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:41,491\n>> I got all five.\n\n177\n00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:42,834\n>> A Winamp, yeah.\n\n178\n00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,297\nSo, like Winamp,\neverybody used to run that.\n\n179\n00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:44,869\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n180\n00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:49,357\nwhen you ran these programs even though\nthey were on top of the operating system,\n\n181\n00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:54,160\nyour video game would reach directly out,\nand access that sound card, right?\n\n182\n00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,339\nAnd if your video game was accessing the\nsound card then your MP3 player couldn't.\n\n183\n00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,686\nSo, while you could run more than one\nprogram at once, you couldn't have more\n\n184\n00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:06,000\nthan one program accessing the same\nhardware at the same time.\n\n185\n00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,990\nAnd worse, if your video game crashed,\n\n186\n00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,983\na lot of times it would lock up the sound\ncard, and it, really annoying, right?\n\n187\n00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,118\nIt'd be playing like one note.\n\n188\n00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:16,657\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> [NOISE] and it would\njust be stuck, and you'd have to reboot.\n\n189\n00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:17,788\nRight?\nYou got to reboot,\n\n190\n00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:20,010\nbefore anything else could\naccess the sound car.\n\n191\n00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,540\n>> [NOISE]\n>> So, that's the old days of computing.\n\n192\n00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,674\nThe new way,\nstarting with NT4, and beyond.\n\n193\n00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:28,960\nSo, this is true all the way,\n\n194\n00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,757\neven into Windows 8 today\n>> Is that, instead of having your\n\n195\n00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:36,742\nsoftware, and your operating system\ndirectly reach out to the hardware,\n\n196\n00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,424\nthere's a layer in between called\nthe hardware abstraction layer.\n\n197\n00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:43,440\nSo, if I take my sad little diagram here.\n\n198\n00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,115\n>> That's nice.\n\n199\n00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:46,238\n>> And just kind of rearrange it a bit.\n\n200\n00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:52,798\n[LAUGH] And of course,\nI'm gonna get more than I intended to get.\n\n201\n00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,486\nJust can't win today.\n\n202\n00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:02,982\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could almost spend 20 minutes,\n\n203\n00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:05,858\njust kind of rearranging my\nlittle text here, all right.\n\n204\n00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:11,300\nSo, instead of having it where all of\nyour software, and stuff runs up here.\n\n205\n00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,821\nAnd then directly accesses the hardware,\n\n206\n00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:19,277\ninstead in Windows operating systems you\nhave this hardware abstraction layer.\n\n207\n00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:24,840\nAnd the hardware\nabstraction layer actually\n\n208\n00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,875\nruns underneath the operating system,\nruns down here.\n\n209\n00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:36,609\nAnd what happens is,\nnobody is allowed to access the hardware,\n\n210\n00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:40,370\nexcept for the hardware abstraction layer.\n\n211\n00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,609\nJust the hardware abstraction layer is\nallowed to access the hardware, and\n\n212\n00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,171\nthat's it.\n\n213\n00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:44,779\nOkay.\nAnd\n\n214\n00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,420\nI draw up beneath the operating system,\n\n215\n00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,410\nbut it's really a part\nof the operating system.\n\n216\n00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,120\nI could have kind of stuck it\nhere inside of the OS, I suppose.\n\n217\n00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,800\nIt might have been a decent\nplace to stick that.\n\n218\n00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,250\nSo, well, I'll just leave it like this.\n\n219\n00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,023\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz apparently,\n\n220\n00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:01,520\nit takes me forever to just draw a box.\n\n221\n00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,100\nSo any how, it really is a part of the OS.\n\n222\n00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,321\nBut the way it works, is the hardware\nabstraction layer creates like a vision of\n\n223\n00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:11,277\nyour hardware, that is a standard.\n\n224\n00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:14,500\nThat is the same on every single PC.\n\n225\n00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,805\nSo, when a programmer writes a video game,\nor when they write a MP3 player, or they\n\n226\n00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:23,193\nwrite a word processor, they don't have to\nworry about printer drivers, and so on.\n\n227\n00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:28,110\nAll they have to do is make their software\nwork, with the hardware abstraction layer.\n\n228\n00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,018\nSo, that video game is written to\nrecognize the Windows abstraction layer.\n\n229\n00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:36,402\nAnd the MP3 player is written to recognize\nthe Windows abstraction layer, and\n\n230\n00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,010\nthat's it.\n\n231\n00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,985\nThen we load drivers.\n\n232\n00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:45,882\nThe drivers tell the hardware abstraction\nlayer, how to access the actual hardware.\n\n233\n00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,126\nRight?\nSo it doesn't matter,\n\n234\n00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:48,440\nwhich sound card we have.\n\n235\n00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,438\nWhoever made the sound card, they just\nmake a driver that tell the hardware\n\n236\n00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:55,110\nabstraction layer,\nhow to access the hardware.\n\n237\n00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,805\nThey don't care, what software you run.\n\n238\n00:11:56,805 --> 00:11:59,150\nThey just make the operating system,\ndo the talking.\n\n239\n00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:04,022\nSo, at the end of the day,\nyour video game, accesses the HAL, and\n\n240\n00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:06,546\nthe MP3 player accesses the HAL.\n\n241\n00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:12,277\nAnd then, at the hardware abstraction\nlayer, it takes those communications, and\n\n242\n00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:18,460\nthe HAL, reaches out to the sound card, to\nplay that music, or to the network card.\n\n243\n00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,435\nAnd since, it's just the HAL doing it,\nthat's one program,\n\n244\n00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:27,010\nit can combine the signals from\nthe video game, and the MP3 player, and\n\n245\n00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,110\nsend them both to the sound card.\n\n246\n00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,419\nAnd now, we can hear two things at once,\nand that's very common these days.\n\n247\n00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,280\nThat you've got music playing, and\nyou do a Skype call, or whatever.\n\n248\n00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,798\nAnd, it's fine.\nYou can have more than program accessing\n\n249\n00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:41,750\nthe same hardware,\nat the same time, right?\n\n250\n00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,733\nSo, our software interacts with the HAL.\n\n251\n00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,930\nThe HAL uses drivers to\ninteract with the hardware.\n\n252\n00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,330\nAnd that's, what we're talking about\ntoday, are these drivers were teaching\n\n253\n00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,932\nWindows, teaching the hardware abstraction\nlayer, how to access that sound card.\n\n254\n00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:58,490\nHow to access that network card,\nthat video card, or whatever.\n\n255\n00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,287\n>> Nice.\nNow, Don,\n\n256\n00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:01,195\nI'll just toss this out there then.\n\n257\n00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:03,189\nI was thinking about it.\n\n258\n00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:06,030\nSo, where would the hypervisor fit?\n\n259\n00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,832\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, now, I know, It's a little off, but\n\n260\n00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:10,740\nyou've got me thinking now.\n\n261\n00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,810\n>> It's a good question.\n\n262\n00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,745\nIf any of you guys have used VMware,\nor Hyper-V, or\n\n263\n00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:19,575\nany kind of virtualization software, it\nworks on a very similar principle, right?\n\n264\n00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,315\nThe hypervisor sits\ndirectly on the hardware.\n\n265\n00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:25,820\nSo, if we had a virtualization\nproduct in here, right?\n\n266\n00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,345\nThat virtualization product would sit\nright here, on the actual hardware.\n\n267\n00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:34,020\nIf it's a type one hypervisor, I know, I'm\ngetting far out on the terminology there.\n\n268\n00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:40,196\nBut Hyper-V, VMware, the newer versions of\nVirtualBox right there, they are type one.\n\n269\n00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,790\nSo, they run right there,\non top of the hardware.\n\n270\n00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:48,767\nThat means your OS, including it's HAL\nis running, on top of that hypervisor.\n\n271\n00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:53,767\nSo, yeah, their complementing technology\nis not a replacement for each other.\n\n272\n00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,303\n>> Nice.\n\n273\n00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:56,377\nWell, sweet.\nWell, thanks.\n\n274\n00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,174\nI mean, that was good.\n\n275\n00:13:58,174 --> 00:13:59,753\n>> So, this is what a driver is.\n\n276\n00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:00,839\nThat's why, I wanted to talk about it.\n\n277\n00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,129\nIt's not specifically on\nthe exam objectives, but\n\n278\n00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:04,436\nit is something nice to know.\n\n279\n00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:08,356\n>> And the side benefit of it is,\nif your video game crashes,\n\n280\n00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:11,700\nit wasn't touching the real hardware.\n\n281\n00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,164\nSo, the sound card's not locked up,\nso the video game crashes, and\n\n282\n00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:18,531\nyour computer can keep running fine\nWhich means a lot more stable.\n\n283\n00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:21,440\nSo, those are the benefits that we get,\nof this new model.\n\n284\n00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,842\nAnd that's why, we need to learn\nabout drivers today, right?\n\n285\n00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,476\nSo, that's where we get.\n\n286\n00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:27,750\n>> Yep.\nWell, sweet.\n\n287\n00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,990\nWell, should we get into\ninstalling the driver?\n\n288\n00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,359\n>> Yeah, let's have at it.\n\n289\n00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,062\n>> So, installing a driver.\n\n290\n00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:36,905\nRight.\n\n291\n00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:40,200\nWe can use a thing called a Plug,\nand Play.\n\n292\n00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,720\nRight?\n\n293\n00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,590\nPlug, and\nPlay with Windows is a real neat thing.\n\n294\n00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:50,312\nYou plug your device in, and the device\nwill tell Windows some information.\n\n295\n00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:54,320\nIdentifying itself, what resources\nit needs, what drivers it need, and\n\n296\n00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,280\nWindows can automatically install\nthe stuff, and get it up, and going.\n\n297\n00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,178\nSo, it doesn't require a whole lot\nof interaction from the user, and\n\n298\n00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:05,678\nthings just kind of start working.\n\n299\n00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:09,678\n>> Yeah, and with each version of Windows,\nthey add more, and more drivers,\n\n300\n00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:11,880\njust built-in to the operating system.\n\n301\n00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,675\nSo, there's a lot of times, like my little\nUSB network adapter I'm using here,\n\n302\n00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:19,583\nI plugged it in, Windows recognized it,\nI didn't have to give it a driver, right?\n\n303\n00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,950\nIt used Plug, and Play to identify it.\n\n304\n00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,635\nIt had the driver,\nit's ready to rock, right?\n\n305\n00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:25,595\nHow about yours?\n\n306\n00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:28,069\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:30,089\n>> Mine was a little bit more unique.\n\n308\n00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,370\nSince, this advanced network\nadapter that I have.\n\n309\n00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,353\nIt did require a driver,\nbeing [LAUGH] a network driver.\n\n310\n00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,973\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a good thing that I had the Wi-Fi\n\n311\n00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:44,373\nin there, so I could go out, and download\nthe driver for the network card, so\n\n312\n00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:45,883\nI could use the Internet.\n\n313\n00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:48,101\n>> So, yeah, mine was not Plug, and Play.\n\n314\n00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,638\n>> So, the thing to remember there,\n\n315\n00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,921\nnot every driver is built-in to Windows,\nright?\n\n316\n00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:54,519\nIf it's not built into Windows and\na lot of them aren't,\n\n317\n00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,938\nbecause it cost a lot of money.\n\n318\n00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,841\nIf a vender wants their\ndriver as part of Windows,\n\n319\n00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:02,790\nthey have to go through\nthe Windows Hardware Quality Labs, right?\n\n320\n00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,188\nWHQL.\nthey have to get it approved.\n\n321\n00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:05,920\nAnd the price,\n\n322\n00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,900\nit's lice twenty grand to get a driver\napproved and listed by Microsoft.\n\n323\n00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,820\nIt's a lot of money.\n\n324\n00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,650\n>> Wow\n>> And every time they do an update they\n\n325\n00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,790\nhave to pay to have the update reviewed\nand so your big hardware vendors,\n\n326\n00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,780\nthey do it, they pay it.\n\n327\n00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,420\nRight.\n\n328\n00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,350\nBut your little guys,\n\n329\n00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,920\nyou know the guys that are oftentimes\ncreating the really cool hardware,\n\n330\n00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,120\nthey don't and so you end up with\na situation like with Nate's network card,\n\n331\n00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,510\nwhere you plug it in, and\nWindows doesn't recognize it, right.\n\n332\n00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,810\nAnd then what do you do?\n\n333\n00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,630\n>> Yeah, well you grab the driver for\nit from some other way.\n\n334\n00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:42,990\nLike the manufacturer's website, which\nis where I did go to get this one, so if\n\n335\n00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,640\nyou have a device that's not immediately\nrecognized and installed by Windows.\n\n336\n00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,340\nyou can use the media that\nwas supplied with the device.\n\n337\n00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,290\nChances are, sometimes they'll be\na little out of date, chance are.\n\n338\n00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,980\n>> Well, the other frustration point-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,490\n>> Is you take a laptop like yours, right?\n\n340\n00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:00,990\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n341\n00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,288\n>> They send you a CD-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,428\n>> I'm going to have a CD drive.\n\n343\n00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,054\n>> Yeah.\nLet's see you drive these guys.\n\n344\n00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,350\nSo yeah I had, you've got the manufactures\nthings include the device you can go to\n\n345\n00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:16,490\nthe manufacturer's website chances are\nthat would be the best route to take so\n\n346\n00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,410\nyou can get the, an updated driver and\n\n347\n00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,600\nthen third way, Windows has included and\neverything's good to go.\n\n348\n00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,000\n>> Now, I will say and\nwe'll talk about this later in the show,\n\n349\n00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,220\njust because Windows has\nthe driver built-in,\n\n350\n00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,600\ndoesn't necessarily mean it's\nthe greatest way to either thought.\n\n351\n00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,380\nand the example I was telling\nNate before the show, I said, oh,\n\n352\n00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,180\nI should have brought my old laptop,\nyeah, my old laptop.\n\n353\n00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,462\nHad an Intel HD,\nI think it was a 4500 video card.\n\n354\n00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:53,000\nAnd so, under Window's 8 it's got an Intel\nHD 4500 video card driver built into it.\n\n355\n00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,300\nBut it has no open GL support.\n\n356\n00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,890\nAnd that means that if I fire\nup Windows 8 on my old laptop,\n\n357\n00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,170\nI get no 3D acceleration.\n\n358\n00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,380\nBut if I go to Intel, and\nI get the driver straight from Intel,\n\n359\n00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,970\nit does have open GL support,\nso I get 3D acceleration.\n\n360\n00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,130\nSo, just because there's\na built in Microsoft driver,\n\n361\n00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,910\ndoesn't always mean that it's better.\n\n362\n00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,160\nIt might be more stable or\nsomething like that.\n\n363\n00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,400\nBut often times,\ngoing directly to the driver.\n\n364\n00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,850\ndirectly to the manufacturer, there we go.\n\n365\n00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,912\nWe'll get you the best driver.\n\n366\n00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:26,640\n>> Yeah, and\nit brings up another point of getting\n\n367\n00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,070\nthe full functionality of a device.\n\n368\n00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,920\nWindows 8 has this real cool thing.\n\n369\n00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,120\nI haven't experienced it a lot yet,\nbut this really cool thing, that it,\n\n370\n00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,660\nas these device apps that run on the start\nscreen and you install a device and\n\n371\n00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,170\nWindows will automatically grab a download\nfrom the WIndows store that device app.\n\n372\n00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:53,650\nAnd it will have more functionality\nmore things that the device does.\n\n373\n00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,450\nAnd there was one that did\nappear on my laptop once.\n\n374\n00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,820\nYeah, and I didn't know.\n\n375\n00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,470\nI was like, oh man,\nwhere'd this thing come from?\n\n376\n00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,995\nIt was for a,\na Hewlett-Packard multifunction printer.\n\n377\n00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:08,415\n>> All of a sudden this icon\nappears on my on the start screen.\n\n378\n00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,715\nAnd yeah and it was I had to\nneed to use that printer and\n\n379\n00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:14,275\nit loaded that thing up and yeah.\n\n380\n00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:20,290\nSo that sometimes getting the devices\nDriver, you can get more stuff.\n\n381\n00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,830\n>> Yeah, multi-function printers\nare a great example, right?\n\n382\n00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,070\nCuz what'll happen is, you know,\n\n383\n00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,760\nyou plug it directly into the USB,\nWindows might recognize it and load it and\n\n384\n00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,550\nyou get printing functionality but\nnot scanning and faxing, right?\n\n385\n00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,000\nAnd then it reaches out and\ngets that suite of software that\n\n386\n00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,400\nHP Print Management Utilities,\nor whatever they're called.\n\n387\n00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,020\nAnd then that enables the other things,\nlike scanning and faxing,\n\n388\n00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,650\nyou get that power.\n\n389\n00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,690\nOur business printer here in\nthe office does the same thing,\n\n390\n00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,380\nthat big Canon image runner?\n\n391\n00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,220\nThat, if you map it on the network, you\nsee it, you get it, and you can print, but\n\n392\n00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,900\nit's not until it downloads the app\nthat you get the ability to do, like,\n\n393\n00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,570\nstapling and hole punching.\n\n394\n00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,950\nAnd all of the bells and\nwhistles that it does.\n\n395\n00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,460\n>> Yep.\n\n396\n00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:58,980\n>> Wow.\n\n397\n00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,530\nSo, man.\n\n398\n00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,500\nI guess when my kid has a,\nlike, his school project.\n\n399\n00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,240\nI can just do all the printing and\nstapling.\n\n400\n00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> And hole punching.\n\n401\n00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,550\nAnd [INAUDIBLE].\n\n402\n00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,645\n>> If you need a, if you need a stapler,\njust bring it in here.\n\n403\n00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:08,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And print it on our printer,\n\n404\n00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,940\nit'll staple.\n\n405\n00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,230\nOr you can buy a stapler.\n\n406\n00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,630\nYeah, stapler.\n>> Probably cheaper.\n\n407\n00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,260\n>> A red one.\n>> Yeah, red.\n\n408\n00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,178\n>> Got to have a red stapler.\n\n409\n00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:16,580\n>> Red paperclip.\n\n410\n00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,225\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n411\n00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:22,450\nSo,that's kind of\nthe automatic side of things,\n\n412\n00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,660\nand there's not really much to see.\n\n413\n00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,460\nYou just hook up the device and it works.\n\n414\n00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,060\nAnd you'll get a little bubble\nthat pops up a window saying\n\n415\n00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,210\nyou're device has been detected and\nit's happy and that's it.\n\n416\n00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,190\nBut, what we want to concern ourselves\nwith here is what if that doesn't happen?\n\n417\n00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,950\nWhat if I hook up the device and\nit's not ready and it's not happy.\n\n418\n00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,530\nOkay.\n\n419\n00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,715\nWell, that's where we need to get involved\nand we need to load some drivers in.\n\n420\n00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:47,645\n>> So, let me ask you this.\n\n421\n00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:53,225\nOkay so does a regular user can they\ninstall devices and, and drivers?\n\n422\n00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:55,555\nOr do you need to be an administrator?\n\n423\n00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,475\n>> So it depends on how you\ndefine a regular user right?\n\n424\n00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:01,870\nSo if you're an administrator on\nyour own machine machine, then yes,\n\n425\n00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,430\nyou can load drivers.\n\n426\n00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,690\nIf you are a home user, and\nyou just bought your laptop at Best Buy,\n\n427\n00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,790\nthen you likely are an administrator\non your own machine and have at it,\n\n428\n00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,400\ninstall your drivers.\n\n429\n00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,620\nYou're in business.\n\n430\n00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,540\nBut if you're in\nan enterprise environment,\n\n431\n00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,960\nwhere an IT department has locked down\nyour systems, and so on, then you're\n\n432\n00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,350\nprobably just a regular user on your\nlaptop and your not able to load drivers.\n\n433\n00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,530\nYou're going to need to get\nsomeone to help you, Right?\n\n434\n00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,630\nYou'll have to get the IT\nguy to come down or\n\n435\n00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,540\nget elevated permissions on your system.\n\n436\n00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,728\n>> All right, so, installing drivers\nin enterprise environment, right?\n\n437\n00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,270\nSo, lets say you have a 1,000 computers.\n\n438\n00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,235\nRight, well to have the admin guy go and\n\n439\n00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:44,330\ninstall stuff that people use a lot\nin there that needs admin rights.\n\n440\n00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,720\n>> You know it could be\na bit time consuming.\n\n441\n00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,980\nSo there is a way to install\ndrivers by pre-staging.\n\n442\n00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:59,840\nThe driver within windows by using\na cool utility called PNPutil.exe right.\n\n443\n00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:04,760\n>> Yeah absolutely and it's not\nsomething you're going to use at home.\n\n444\n00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,130\nBut in a business environment absolutely.\n\n445\n00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,430\nYou see it used all the time.\n\n446\n00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,720\nSo, Nate you're going\nto do demo on that one?\n\n447\n00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,890\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.\n\n448\n00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,220\nyep let's take let's take a look at it.\n\n449\n00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,110\nSo what I've done is I've\ngrabbed a driver, right?\n\n450\n00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,800\nAnd just the driver off the machine\nthat was already existing.\n\n451\n00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,680\nAnd I want to do this real cool thing and\nhave these drivers but\n\n452\n00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,860\nbecause it's, it had to be signed and\nall other stuff, it wasn't working.\n\n453\n00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,700\n>> So, it was the new security\nfeature in those days.\n\n454\n00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,325\n>> Yeah.\n\n455\n00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:33,940\nYeah, I couldn't quite get around,\nwell, I could if I wanted to.\n\n456\n00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,075\n[LAUGH] But it was taking too much time.\n\n457\n00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:37,881\n>> You can do anything if\nyou put your mind to it.\n\n458\n00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,175\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n459\n00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,795\nThanks Don, I appreciate that.\n\n460\n00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:43,585\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right so now, so yeah.\n\n461\n00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:47,400\nTo do that, if, nope, wait.\n\n462\n00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,930\nIs that one mine?\n\n463\n00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,140\nI think it is.\n\n464\n00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,050\nYou know what?\n\n465\n00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,848\nLet me redo that real quick.\n\n466\n00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:54,750\n[LAUGH] Cuz it, sorry.\n\n467\n00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,620\nI, well, I\n>> Did you load the wrong driver?\n\n468\n00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,550\n>> Well,\n[LAUGH] I was doing stuff before the show.\n\n469\n00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,710\nLet me just try it.\n\n470\n00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,240\nSorry.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n471\n00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,874\n>> So, PnP\n\n472\n00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:05,050\nUtil,\n>> Yeah.\n\n473\n00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,428\nSo,the PnP utility, what Nate's\ngoing to do here in just a second,\n\n474\n00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,840\nwhen he gets his computer squared away.\n\n475\n00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is he's going to\n\n476\n00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,060\nshow you a command line utility we\ncan use to install a driver for\n\n477\n00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,180\nhardware that's not there yet, right?\n\n478\n00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,845\nWe do this in anticipation\nof the hardware being added.\n\n479\n00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:21,660\nSo, maybe your the IT guy for\na company and\n\n480\n00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,680\nyou get a call from Steve\ndown in accounting.\n\n481\n00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,410\nAnd Steve says,\n\n482\n00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,475\n\"Hey I just ordered a brand new printer\nit's an HP Laser Jet 53 hundred XI.\n\n483\n00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,925\nRight?\nI'm just making that up.\n\n484\n00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:36,270\nAnd I'm going to get it on Tuesday can you\nguys make sure the driver is ready for me.\n\n485\n00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,767\nAll right.\nAnd so as the IT guy,\n\n486\n00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:42,926\nyou can reach out to that system and\nyou can either manually walk over there or\n\n487\n00:23:42,926 --> 00:23:47,278\nyou can do it over the network, and\nyou can use the PnP Util to load\n\n488\n00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,678\nthat driver even before\nthe hardware is present.\n\n489\n00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:54,875\nOkay, you get that driver loaded, so\nthat when Steve gets that printer, and\n\n490\n00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:59,200\nhe unboxes it, and he plugs it into\nthe computer, Windows will recognize it.\n\n491\n00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,290\nThe driver will be loaded, and\n\n492\n00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,400\nit's in business,\neven though he's not an administrator.\n\n493\n00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,070\nThe driver is already loaded.\n\n494\n00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,020\nAll right?\nSo,\n\n495\n00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,380\nreally handy in that\nkind of an environment.\n\n496\n00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,440\nAnother example would be, let's say,\n\n497\n00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,970\nthat you just bought 1,000 new computers,\nright?\n\n498\n00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,780\nAnd you have a software image you're gonna\nbe deploying to all of those computers, so\n\n499\n00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,160\nthey're set up identically.\n\n500\n00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,490\nWell, you may need to load a custom\ndriver, for whatever your hardware is.\n\n501\n00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,500\nAnd you don't wanna have to go\nto 1,000 machines to do it.\n\n502\n00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,710\nSo you can pre-stage that\ndriver in your image, and\n\n503\n00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,190\npush it out that way, and\nget it out to the machines.\n\n504\n00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,400\nAs you roll the image out,\nit will already have the driver built in.\n\n505\n00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,090\nSo neat functionality,\nand a powerful thing.\n\n506\n00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,845\nAgain, not really for the home user,\nbut for the business user.\n\n507\n00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:51,185\nNow, how do we know, whether we\nneed a pre-staged driver or not.\n\n508\n00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:55,001\nWell, a lot of times drivers\nare built-in to Windows, and\n\n509\n00:24:55,001 --> 00:25:00,880\nyou can go to Microsoft's website to the\nWHQL, the Windows Hardware Quality Labs.\n\n510\n00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,520\nAnd they have a list of all the hardware\nthat's directly supported in the OS.\n\n511\n00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,170\nOr another way we can\njust test it is you can\n\n512\n00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,180\nhook the device up to your computer and\nsee if it recognizes it.\n\n513\n00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,000\nLet me show you an example on my computer.\n\n514\n00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,120\nLet me get into my Device Manager.\n\n515\n00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,100\nSo, I know for\n\n516\n00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,310\na fact that there's some drivers\nthat I haven't loaded on my laptop.\n\n517\n00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,407\nSo, let me just pull this up.\n\n518\n00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:24,040\nHere's my Device Manager,\nand you can look in here and\n\n519\n00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,820\nsee where I've got Other Devices.\n\n520\n00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,120\nGenerally, if something\nends up in Other Devices,\n\n521\n00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,500\nthat means you're missing the driver,\nright?\n\n522\n00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,970\nAnd I can see right here,\nI've got a PCI Data Acquisition and\n\n523\n00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,480\nSignal Processing Controller,\nwhich that's great.\n\n524\n00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,447\n[LAUGH] And then I can see, that I've\ngot about eight Unknown Devices, okay?\n\n525\n00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:47,130\nAll these Unknown Devices have\nlittle yellow circles and\n\n526\n00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,060\nexclamation points on them, and\nthat let's me know there's a problem.\n\n527\n00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,900\nThis is hardware that\nWindows didn't recognize.\n\n528\n00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,930\nWindows doesn't know what\nthe heck this stuff is, and\n\n529\n00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,430\nso I need to load a driver for it, right?\n\n530\n00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,580\nSo this is an example.\n\n531\n00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,560\nThis is how we know that\nwe're going to need it.\n\n532\n00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,672\nAnother way is that if you plug the\nhardware in, and Windows doesn't recognize\n\n533\n00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:08,652\nit, you get a little bubble that pops\nup at the bottom-right of the screen.\n\n534\n00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,701\nAnd it tells you your hardware\nwas not configured properly, or\n\n535\n00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:13,768\nyour hardware is not ready to use.\n\n536\n00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:17,050\nSo it lets you know that, but\nthat bubble only stays up so long.\n\n537\n00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,190\nSo it's already gone for me,\n\n538\n00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,126\nthat's why I wanted to show you\nhere in the Device Manager.\n\n539\n00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:23,990\nYou can [LAUGH] always tell on\nthe Device Manager whether or\n\n540\n00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,540\nnot you've got something you\nneed a driver for, all right?\n\n541\n00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,840\nSo what we're going to do is, we're\ngonna show you two ways to solve that.\n\n542\n00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,510\nNate's going to do the PnP Utility\nto load the driver in ahead of time.\n\n543\n00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,030\nAnd then I'm gonna show\nyou the more manual way,\n\n544\n00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,240\nthe way that like a home user would do it,\nor whatever.\n\n545\n00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,030\nAnd I know, Nate,\n\n546\n00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,460\nyou're geared up to do this but\nwe're kind of running low on time.\n\n547\n00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,050\n>> Yeah.\n>> So why don't we stop, and take a break.\n\n548\n00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,660\nAnd when we get back,\nyou can do the PnP demo, and\n\n549\n00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,860\nthen I'll do the consumer way, right?\n\n550\n00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,530\nSound cool?\n\n551\n00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,490\n>> Yeah, I like it.\n\n552\n00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,710\nAwesome.\nAll right, well, let's stop here.\n\n553\n00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,692\nWe'll take a break, and\nwe'll see you back in a few minutes.\n\n554\n00:26:56,692 --> 00:27:04,877\n[SOUND].\n\n555\n00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:07,450\n[LAUGH] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n556\n00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,500\nWe'll finish our argument over\nBritney Spears versus Christina Aguilera\n\n557\n00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,590\nafter the show.\n\n558\n00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,984\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n559\n00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:15,040\n>> For those of you who wondered what\n\n560\n00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,064\nwe talk about during the break.\n\n561\n00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:20,710\n[LAUGH] I had to real quick\nthink of like pop stars names.\n\n562\n00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,870\n>> Well you came out,\nI mean that was pretty quick.\n\n563\n00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,800\n>> I did all right, didn't I?\n\n564\n00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,780\n>> They're on your head.\n\n565\n00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,762\n>> So probably, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n566\n00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:31,550\n[LAUGH] So anyhow,\nwe left off talking about drivers, right?\n\n567\n00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,110\nGetting drivers installed.\n\n568\n00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,720\nAnd I think we're at the point where\nyou are going to show us the Pnputil.\n\n569\n00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,919\n>> Yes.\nPnputil,\n\n570\n00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,480\na way to pre-stage drivers\ninto the driver store.\n\n571\n00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,790\nSo that if you have a user or\nsomewhere that puts in a device,\n\n572\n00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,150\nit will pull the driver\nout of the driver store,\n\n573\n00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,900\nand create a better user experience for\nthat user.\n\n574\n00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,945\n>> That sounds like right out\nof Microsoft marketing material.\n\n575\n00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:57,710\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n576\n00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,890\n>> [LAUGH] Your user experience\nwill be significantly streamlined.\n\n577\n00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,236\n>> Well, Windows 8 was designed for\nan optimal user experience.\n\n578\n00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:06,300\nAll right.\n>> Awesome.\n\n579\n00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,370\n[LAUGH] So the Pnputil, right?\n\n580\n00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,718\nSo, I brought up an administrative\ncommand prompt, because the driver\n\n581\n00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:20,170\nstore is a protected thing and so\nyou need administrative rights to do it.\n\n582\n00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:29,290\nSo what we're going to do is navigate to\nthe folder, where I have it in driver.\n\n583\n00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,260\n>> So this is a driver that you downloaded\nfrom the manufacturer, or wherever, right?\n\n584\n00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,830\n>> Yes.\n\n585\n00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,680\n>> And you extracted it into this folder.\n\n586\n00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,550\n>> Yep.\nAll right.\n\n587\n00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,550\nAnd so there's our driver, dptf.inf.\n\n588\n00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,080\n>> Do I wanna know what that stands for?\n\n589\n00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,735\n>> Well,\nI was gonna make up something for it.\n\n590\n00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:47,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, I don't know.\n\n591\n00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,950\nI dug it out of my computer somewhere.\n\n592\n00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,690\nIt does something.\n\n593\n00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,249\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH] So just so you guys know at home,\n\n594\n00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:56,527\nmost drivers will come with several files,\nright?\n\n595\n00:28:56,527 --> 00:29:01,720\nAt a bare minimum, they have to have\nat least one, and it's an INF file.\n\n596\n00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,190\nAnd the INF file is what defines\nthe driver's name, and what's necessary.\n\n597\n00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,380\nIf there's extended functionality, like\na multi-function printer, or whatever,\n\n598\n00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,370\nit might have some DLL files, and\n\n599\n00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,740\nother things,\nwhich just add that extra functionality.\n\n600\n00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,521\nBut this is what you'll have at a minimum.\n\n601\n00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,920\nYou'll at least have an INF file.\n\n602\n00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,130\n>> So, thing's done?\n\n603\n00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:19,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n604\n00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,545\n>> All right, so\nthe pnp.exe is our command, right?\n\n605\n00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:26,842\nThen we'll go, and click this button.\n\n606\n00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:27,560\nAll right.\n\n607\n00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,390\nSo, we have some switches for\nthe Pnputil, right?\n\n608\n00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,852\nDash A adds things.\n\n609\n00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:39,650\nDash I add install, we got E to enumerate,\nor just kind of lists all the driver.\n\n610\n00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,509\nD will delete, and F will force delete.\n\n611\n00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,060\n>> And let me just clarify on the I\nbecause it sounds a lot like A, right?\n\n612\n00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,770\nA adds, I adds what's the difference?\n\n613\n00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,450\nYou use I if the hardware is actually\nattached, and you're ready to install and\n\n614\n00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,570\nuse the driver.\n\n615\n00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,300\nIf you just do A, it loads the driver,\nbut doesn't fully install it.\n\n616\n00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,610\nIt doesn't activate it,\nbecause if the hardware's not there,\n\n617\n00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,380\nyou don't need it installed, right?\n\n618\n00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,130\nBut it's there, and it's ready to go.\n\n619\n00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,214\nSo A is what you use for pre-staging,\n\n620\n00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:10,870\nI is what you use if\nthe hardware's already attached.\n\n621\n00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,590\n>> Sweet.\nThanks Don.\n\n622\n00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,723\nI kind of glassed over that,\nin my reading.\n\n623\n00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:16,698\n[LAUGH]\n>> It confused me once before, so\n\n624\n00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,098\nI'm trying to save people time.\n\n625\n00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:19,070\n[LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n626\n00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,560\nOkay, since we're using\nthis computer right now,\n\n627\n00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,411\nwe will not install\nwhichever driver it is.\n\n628\n00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,930\nSo we will use the I.\n\n629\n00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,230\n>> The next part is-\n>> A.\n\n630\n00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,015\n>> Or A, I'm sorry.\n\n631\n00:30:29,015 --> 00:30:32,113\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we're going to tell it where that\n\n632\n00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:36,522\ndriver is, so it's in there,\nand it's called dptf.inf.\n\n633\n00:30:36,522 --> 00:30:37,090\n>> Yep.\n\n634\n00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,360\n>> And we'll hit, Enter.\n\n635\n00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,290\nAnd da, da, da.\n\n636\n00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,450\n>> Oh,\nsystem cannot find the file specified.\n\n637\n00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,385\nDidn't we just see that file?\n\n638\n00:30:47,385 --> 00:30:48,290\n>> Yeah.\n\n639\n00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,820\n>> I thought we did.\n\n640\n00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,700\nDid it delete itself?\n\n641\n00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,000\n>> There it is.\n\n642\n00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,010\nAnd now look at my-\n>> You know what?\n\n643\n00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,890\nSo remember, how I mentioned the other\nfiles, like the DLL files, and\n\n644\n00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,740\nother things that are associated with it?\n\n645\n00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,210\nInside the INF file,\n\n646\n00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,870\nit'll have a list of any other associated\nfiles that might be necessary.\n\n647\n00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,720\nAnd they're normally included right here,\n\n648\n00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,152\nwhen you extract out that driver\nthat's included right in this spot.\n\n649\n00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:16,370\nThis one's by itself, so it's possible\nthat inside of that driver there might be\n\n650\n00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,080\nsome references to other files.\n\n651\n00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,600\nBut we don't know unless we open it up and\ntake a look at it.\n\n652\n00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,609\nWhy don't you do it, let's take a look?\n\n653\n00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:24,724\nOr no.\n\n654\n00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:28,683\n>> Well, yeah, during the break,\nI tested it two times, just to-\n\n655\n00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:29,480\n>> Oh, and it worked?\n\n656\n00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,060\n>> Yeah, and it worked.\n\n657\n00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,190\nSo it was kind of a bizarre thing.\n\n658\n00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,540\nBut I can go out, and grab a-\n>> The driver package failed.\n\n659\n00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,891\nThe system cannot find the file specified.\n\n660\n00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:39,282\n>> Yeah, it's right in there.\n\n661\n00:31:39,282 --> 00:31:40,165\nWell, all right.\n\n662\n00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,059\nYeah, no big deal.\n\n663\n00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:43,508\nSo, that [LAUGH].\n\n664\n00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:45,667\nSo running that command, right?\n\n665\n00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:49,680\nI must have done something during\nthe break to that poor file.\n\n666\n00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,639\nBut what we can do, right?\n\n667\n00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,012\nSo, the -e, right?\n\n668\n00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:56,421\nThat lists all the different drivers,\nright?\n\n669\n00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:57,970\nIt went by kinda quick.\n\n670\n00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,780\n>> Everything that's\ninstalled on your machine?\n\n671\n00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,390\n>> Correct.\n\n672\n00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:04,438\nNow, all right so the drivers, when\nthey go into this driver store, right?\n\n673\n00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:08,182\nIt changes the name to an OEM and\na number.\n\n674\n00:32:08,182 --> 00:32:11,057\nNow I'm not sure the reasoning behind it,\nbut\n\n675\n00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:13,796\nit does rename the driver\nOEM dash a number.\n\n676\n00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:18,537\nAnd so\nif you needed to delete a driver for\n\n677\n00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:25,509\nsome reason using the -d switch,\nso it would be PnPUtil and\n\n678\n00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:31,150\nthen OEM10.inf, and that would erase it.\n\n679\n00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:36,239\n>> So you'd use PnPUtil-e to get the list\nand find it, and then you'd do PnPUtil-d\n\n680\n00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:41,235\nfollowed by OEM10, or whatever to actually\nremove it and get it out of there.\n\n681\n00:32:41,235 --> 00:32:42,103\n>> Uh-huh, okay.\n\n682\n00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:46,556\nYeah, and if for some reason it doesn't\ndelete and says I can't because\n\n683\n00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:51,450\nI'm using that driver, you can use the F\nswitch in there too, to force delete.\n\n684\n00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,005\nAnd that will just [SOUND] take it out.\n\n685\n00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:54,795\n>> Tell it whose boss.\n\n686\n00:32:54,795 --> 00:32:55,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n687\n00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,224\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah, all day.\n\n688\n00:32:57,224 --> 00:32:58,940\n>> Listen here computer.\n\n689\n00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,210\nDo as I say.\n\n690\n00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,020\n>> You will delete it.\n\n691\n00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,050\n>> So yeah and that's not uncommon for\n\n692\n00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,680\nthe computer to resist you\non something like that.\n\n693\n00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,440\nSo just keep in mind it's\npretty straightforward,\n\n694\n00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,615\npretty easy to use in a corporate or\nenterprise environment.\n\n695\n00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:14,985\nIf you're an IT admin and you've got users\nadding hardware and they're not admins,\n\n696\n00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:18,745\nthe PnP utility is one of the easiest\nways to load that driver in there and\n\n697\n00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:21,260\nget it ready to launch, right?\n\n698\n00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,360\nSo, that's cool.\n\n699\n00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,620\nBut what if we're just a home user, right?\n\n700\n00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,950\nWhat if I'm on my own laptop?\n\n701\n00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,940\nI am an administrator.\n\n702\n00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,080\nDo I need to muck about\nwith the PnP utility?\n\n703\n00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,920\nNo, right?\n\n704\n00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,040\nWe can install drivers\nthe good old fashioned way.\n\n705\n00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,830\nSo that's what I'm gonna show\nyou guys on my laptop is\n\n706\n00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,480\non my laptop I'm running Window's 8.\n\n707\n00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,520\nAnd Window's 8 had drivers for\nthe majority of the stuff on my system.\n\n708\n00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,130\nSo I really didn't have to do\nanything to get up and running.\n\n709\n00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,410\nObviously I'm running on\nmy machine right now.\n\n710\n00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,340\nSo, but what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna show you how\n\n711\n00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,430\nsome of the stuff on my\nlaptop didn't get picked up.\n\n712\n00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,640\nSpecifically, the power management stuff.\n\n713\n00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,180\nAnd so I'm going to kinda show you how I\ncan go out and download those drivers and\n\n714\n00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,472\nget them loaded and get them in place.\n\n715\n00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,400\nAll right?\n\n716\n00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,540\nNow one of the problems you'll have if\nyou've added just one piece of hardware.\n\n717\n00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,450\nIf I just hooked up a printer and\nI go into my device manager and\n\n718\n00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:15,060\nit shows as something that is not present,\nright?\n\n719\n00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,850\nIf it's one device,\nI know exactly what device that was.\n\n720\n00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,500\nBut, on my laptop,\nI did a clean install of Windows 8.\n\n721\n00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,940\nSo, it is a ton of stuff that's in there,\nthat's missing, okay?\n\n722\n00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,530\nSo, where I wanna start is, I wanna\nstart by just showing how to go out and\n\n723\n00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,810\nfind the vendor drivers.\n\n724\n00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,368\nOkay?\nNate,\n\n725\n00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:34,710\nlet's use your laptop cuz you're\nstill up on the digital camera.\n\n726\n00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,280\n>> All right.\n\n727\n00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,436\nSure.\n\n728\n00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:40,209\n>> So my laptop is a Dell XPS 12, right?\n\n729\n00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:42,550\nSo that's my model number,\nthat's what it is.\n\n730\n00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,641\nAnd Nate,\ncan you go to www.support.Dell.com?\n\n731\n00:34:45,641 --> 00:34:47,119\n>> Yep.\n\n732\n00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,500\n>> And Dell,\nthey make all their drivers available.\n\n733\n00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:56,030\nIf I had an HP, or a Lenovo, or a Sony,\nor whatever, I'd go to their websites,\n\n734\n00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,350\nand most of them have where you\ncan punch in your model number and\n\n735\n00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,290\nfind all the drivers for\nyour hardware, okay?\n\n736\n00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:05,440\nIf I was adding a printer, I'd go to\nthe printer manufacturer's webpage.\n\n737\n00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,120\nIf I was adding a video card,\nI'd go to ATI or Nvidia's page, or\n\n738\n00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,400\nwhoever's page it is that I'm loading up.\n\n739\n00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,560\nAll right, now with Dell,\n\n740\n00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,520\nthey have a couple of different\nways you can do the lookup.\n\n741\n00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,720\nIf you know your model number,\nyou can search by model number.\n\n742\n00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,500\nBut the problem is,\n\n743\n00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,620\nsometimes Dell will send out the same\nmodel configured different ways, right?\n\n744\n00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,570\nYou might have different video cards or\nwhatever.\n\n745\n00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:32,310\nSo they like you to punch in your service\ntag, like the serial number for your unit.\n\n746\n00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,121\nBut let's not do that Nate.\n\n747\n00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:38,277\nLet's just go and choose laptops and\nwe'll browse them that way.\n\n748\n00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:42,597\nAnd, let's see, this is an XPS.\n\n749\n00:35:42,597 --> 00:35:44,743\nAnd this an XPS 12.\n\n750\n00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,404\nThere's 2 versions of the XPS 12.\n\n751\n00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,621\nI know that mine is the 9Q23.\n\n752\n00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:49,270\nSo let's go with that one.\n\n753\n00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,070\nIf you don't know your model number,\n\n754\n00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,895\nit's usually written on the bottom of your\nlaptop, and that's where mine's written.\n\n755\n00:35:54,895 --> 00:35:57,700\n>> Mm-hm, or\nmaybe under the battery or something,\n\n756\n00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,730\nif you do have a removable battery.\n\n757\n00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,670\n>> That, that's a good point.\n\n758\n00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,360\nOn some,\nthey do stick it under the battery, yeah.\n\n759\n00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,220\nAll right, so from here,\nwe'll just click on drivers and downloads.\n\n760\n00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,501\nAnd here Dell is gonna give us\nthe list of all the drivers.\n\n761\n00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:13,365\nNow, when you download a driver,\nthere's two real important things, right?\n\n762\n00:36:13,365 --> 00:36:14,900\nThey're both equally important.\n\n763\n00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,555\nOne, is that you need to get the right\ndriver for your hardware, right?\n\n764\n00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:21,105\nIf I had an Nvidia video card,\n\n765\n00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:23,445\nthen an ATI video driver's\nnot gonna work for me, right?\n\n766\n00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:26,575\nI gotta get the right driver for\nmy hardware.\n\n767\n00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:31,287\nThe second thing is, I need to get\nthe right driver for my operating system,\n\n768\n00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:35,597\nthat a Windows XP driver most\nlikely won't work in Windows 8.\n\n769\n00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:36,905\nSo I gottoa get the right one.\n\n770\n00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:41,200\nNot only that, I've got to worry\nabout 32-bit versus 64-bit.\n\n771\n00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,990\nIf I'm on a 64-bit OS,\nI need a 64-bit driver.\n\n772\n00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,720\nNow some vendors combine them together,\nand that's nice.\n\n773\n00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,906\nSome don't, all right?\n\n774\n00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:54,759\nSo, the Dell website here has defaulted\nto Microsoft Windows 8 64-bit.\n\n775\n00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:57,070\nBut Nate, if you drop that down\nwhat else do we have on that list?\n\n776\n00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,530\n>> That's it.\n\n777\n00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,170\n>> All right.\n\n778\n00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,610\nSo apparently that's the only one\nsupported by Dell on this laptop.\n\n779\n00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:09,067\nOn other laptops they might support more\nOSes and you'll see WIndows 8 32-bit or\n\n780\n00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,960\nWindows 7 64-bit or whatever.\n\n781\n00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,290\nAnd you need to make sure\nyou pick the right OS, okay?\n\n782\n00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,600\nOh god forbid we wanted to\nwrite in Linux or something.\n\n783\n00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,549\n>> Yeah, gosh.\n>> We would be out of luck.\n\n784\n00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,930\n>> Nothing there, all right.\n\n785\n00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,250\n>> Out as luck as far\nas Dell is concerned.\n\n786\n00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,310\nWe can always go to the vendors.\n\n787\n00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:27,570\nAll right, so now what we see is a list of\nall the different drivers for my laptop.\n\n788\n00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,180\nAnd, there's several in here.\n\n789\n00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,160\nNow, before the break,\nI brought up my device manager and\n\n790\n00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,551\nyou guys saw, I had a whole list of\nthings that said unsupported device.\n\n791\n00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,770\nActually, what did it say?\n\n792\n00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,170\nIt said unknown device, right?\n\n793\n00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:45,090\nWell on a laptop and on a desktop for that\nmatter, one of the most important drivers\n\n794\n00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,570\nyou can load is what's\ncalled your chip set driver.\n\n795\n00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,930\nYou'll have a number of different\nhardware components on your motherboard\n\n796\n00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,630\nthat Windows may or may not recognize.\n\n797\n00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,750\nSo that's usually\nthe place you wanna start.\n\n798\n00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,220\nIf you've got unknown devices like this,\n\n799\n00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,540\nmaking sure that you got the right\nchips that driver loaded is a big help.\n\n800\n00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,730\nSo Nate, go under chips up there and\nlooks like we have three choices.\n\n801\n00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,540\nLet's see what our choices are.\n\n802\n00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,250\nAll right,\nwe've got the Intel chip set driver.\n\n803\n00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,680\nThat sounds like a winner.\n\n804\n00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,680\nWe've got the Intel dynamic platform and\nthermal framework driver.\n\n805\n00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,996\nThat's a nice collection of data there.\n\n806\n00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:20,005\n[LAUGH] So, it's a mouthful.\n\n807\n00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:24,730\nSo what that one is is that one's\ngonna be power management and\n\n808\n00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,140\nthe way that it manages the fans and\nstuff inside of the laptop.\n\n809\n00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,700\nAnd then lastly we've got the Intel\nmanagement engine interface driver.\n\n810\n00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,310\nThat's another mouthful.\n\n811\n00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:39,170\nThat's for people who are doing the,\nIntel calls it Intel vPro, but\n\n812\n00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,210\nthe remote management of your systems.\n\n813\n00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,717\nA home user's not gonna do that,\nso it's not really necessary.\n\n814\n00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:47,625\nBut the other two are files that I'm\ngonna need to get on my laptop and so\n\n815\n00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,417\nI'm gonna start with that\nIntel chipset driver.\n\n816\n00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:55,320\nAnd well I guess Nate,\nyou don't need to download it here.\n\n817\n00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,950\nI'll download it on mine.\n\n818\n00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,465\nBut that'll be one that we start with.\n\n819\n00:38:59,465 --> 00:38:59,990\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n820\n00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,530\n>> Now, on a laptop, it's pretty easy\nto go and find this stuff, right?\n\n821\n00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,370\nLet's show them like Lenovo, for example.\n\n822\n00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,816\nGo to www.support.lenovo.com.\n\n823\n00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:15,960\n>> [SOUND]\n>> So, now let me ask you this, right?\n\n824\n00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,080\nSo, the order that drivers are loaded.\n\n825\n00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,280\nSee it was my impression that you\nhave a fresh install of Windows,\n\n826\n00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,880\nthe chipset drivers is always first,\n\n827\n00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,060\ncuz it kind of lays the foundation for all\nthe other drivers that will be installed.\n\n828\n00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,250\nWhat's your opinion on that?\n\n829\n00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,650\nIs there a proper order to install them?\n\n830\n00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:38,032\n>> So, there's not a, let put it this way.\n\n831\n00:39:38,032 --> 00:39:40,650\nIt's a good idea to\nfollow a certain order.\n\n832\n00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,768\n>> But if you don't,\nit doesn't break anything.\n\n833\n00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:47,287\nSo what happens is, oftentimes when you\ninstall your chipset driver, some of\n\n834\n00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:51,463\nthe hardware that wasn't recognized\nMay now properly be recognized and\n\n835\n00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:53,530\nthen require additional drivers.\n\n836\n00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,133\nRight?\n\n837\n00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:56,830\nBut you won't know that until\nyou install the chipset.\n\n838\n00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,320\nSo if you start installing\nall of your other drivers and\n\n839\n00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,150\ninstall the chipset last,\nthen you might have to go back and\n\n840\n00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,590\nload some more drivers that it\ndidn't detect in the first place.\n\n841\n00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,880\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n842\n00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,520\nit's the same amount of work, really\nregardless of what order you follow.\n\n843\n00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,030\nSo, if you get them out of order,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n844\n00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,415\nThere's no order to memorize.\n\n845\n00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:13,780\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n846\n00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,540\nBut as a rule of thumb,\nI usually start with the chipset.\n\n847\n00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,160\nThat's one of the first\nthings that I load.\n\n848\n00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,830\nAlthough you can see I've\nbeen using this laptop\n\n849\n00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,341\nfor\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n850\n00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:22,875\n>> Two weeks like this without the chipset\n\n851\n00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:23,530\ndriver loaded.\n\n852\n00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,810\n>> So it's not essential.\n\n853\n00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,470\n>> Yeah.\nThat's crazy.\n\n854\n00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,300\n>> All right.\n\n855\n00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,245\nSo you're on the Lenova site now.\n\n856\n00:40:29,245 --> 00:40:30,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And if you go here you'll see,\n\n857\n00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,690\noh nice and big right there.\n\n858\n00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,390\n>> Oops, I clicked on it..\n\n859\n00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,110\n>> Drivers.\n\n860\n00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,220\nNo, that's cool.\n\n861\n00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,020\nSo drivers.\n\n862\n00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,615\nAnd then you punch in your laptop, right?\n\n863\n00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:39,651\nSo, I have a Lenova at home.\n\n864\n00:40:39,651 --> 00:40:41,623\nIt's an SL510.\n\n865\n00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:44,490\n>> Yeah, they microsize that.\n\n866\n00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,660\n>> That is nice and tiny, isn't it?\n\n867\n00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,410\nSo there you go.\n\n868\n00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:53,430\nThinkpad SL something laptop.\n\n869\n00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,345\nWell that's nice and microscopic there.\n\n870\n00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:57,578\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And mine was a 510, the last one.\n\n871\n00:40:57,578 --> 00:41:04,740\nAll right this is my old laptop, and oh,\nthey want you to pick a machine type.\n\n872\n00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,550\nShoot.\n\n873\n00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,760\n>> Let's do the last one.\n\n874\n00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,500\n>> Yeah, sure.\n>> Oh, well.\n\n875\n00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,600\nNo.\nI'm pretty sure mine was,\n\n876\n00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,660\nwell, that'll do it.\n\n877\n00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,620\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n878\n00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,680\nGo ahead and pick one.\n\n879\n00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,360\nSo, can you zoom in on that?\n\n880\n00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,449\nDoes it let you?\n\n881\n00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,480\nYou're already zoomed in a decent bit.\n\n882\n00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,120\nBut yeah, zoom in on that a bit.\n\n883\n00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,060\nLet's, nice.\n\n884\n00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,762\nZoom in on it just a little bit,\napparently.\n\n885\n00:41:30,762 --> 00:41:33,520\nAll right, so you can see\nthe different operating systems here.\n\n886\n00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,120\nSo Lenovo was supporting a lot more\noperating systems on this laptop than\n\n887\n00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,100\nDell did on my laptop, right?\n\n888\n00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,670\nSo you can see if you're gonna\nrun Chrome OS or Android.\n\n889\n00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,700\nThat's entertaining.\n\n890\n00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,360\n>> Oh wow.\n\n891\n00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,120\n>> If you're going to run DOS or\nWindows 3.X,\n\n892\n00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,520\nthey are all over the place on this one.\n\n893\n00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,059\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux and,\nscroll down to Windows 7 64-bit,\n\n894\n00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:54,810\nwhich is what my old laptop shipped with.\n\n895\n00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,180\nThere you go.\n\n896\n00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,620\nSo go ahead and\nchoose Windows 7 64-bit, and\n\n897\n00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:03,320\nyou'll see they even break it down\nto home, basic, home premium.\n\n898\n00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,230\nIt's probably the same drivers across\nthem, but they list it very specifically\n\n899\n00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,840\nso that you as the end user know\nthat you're in the right spot.\n\n900\n00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,692\nAll right?\n\n901\n00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:14,090\nAnd then when you choose it,\n\n902\n00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,910\nthere we go, it's now gonna\nload up the list of drivers.\n\n903\n00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,340\nAnd you'll see the same as Dell, right?\n\n904\n00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,630\nWe got chipsets, camera, Bluetooth,\nall the different things.\n\n905\n00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,860\nAnd you can go in and\ndownload those drivers.\n\n906\n00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,920\nAnd see how this Windows 7 driver is\nthe same for the L410, the L510, SL.\n\n907\n00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,390\nSo, they use the same drivers across\nmultiple systems because it's really all\n\n908\n00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,500\nthe same hardware at the end of the day.\n\n909\n00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,465\n>> Woo!\n>> They don't want you to know that but,\n\n910\n00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:40,209\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n911\n00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,380\n>> That's how it is.\n\n912\n00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,300\n>> Right?\nWell, right on.\n\n913\n00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,950\nAll right.\nSo, yeah.\n\n914\n00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,604\nSo there we go.\nSo,\n\n915\n00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,970\ngetting our drivers through\nthe vendor's website.\n\n916\n00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,432\n>> Now what we showed you\nhere were systems, right?\n\n917\n00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:52,436\nSo if I'm going for a laptop, right?\n\n918\n00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,571\nBut what if I'm going for\na specific piece of hardware, right?\n\n919\n00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:58,166\nWhat video card do you have in your\ncomputer at home right now, Nate?\n\n920\n00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,340\n>> It's a Radeon 6950.\n\n921\n00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:01,883\n>> Okay.\n\n922\n00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:05,020\nSo, why don't we show them if\nyou want to get something for\n\n923\n00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,692\na specific piece of hardware.\n\n924\n00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:07,972\nThat's ATI, right?\n\n925\n00:43:07,972 --> 00:43:12,012\nATI Radeon 6950.\n\n926\n00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:15,910\nSo you'd fire up the ATI website,\nand I get confused who owns who.\n\n927\n00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,290\nAMD owns ATI, right?\n\n928\n00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,690\n>> Correct.\n>> So, do you go to AMD's website or?\n\n929\n00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:21,195\n>> Yes.\n\n930\n00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:22,378\n>> www.support.amd.com.\n\n931\n00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:28,144\nAnd then AMD, they make systems and\nprocessors, but\n\n932\n00:43:28,144 --> 00:43:31,050\nthey also make video cards\nunder the ATI brand.\n\n933\n00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:35,010\nSo you can jump in here to,\nwhere would you go?\n\n934\n00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:37,610\nI guess the certified drivers?\n\n935\n00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,976\n>> Certified drivers, down here, yep.\n\n936\n00:43:39,976 --> 00:43:41,431\nClick that.\n\n937\n00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:44,590\n>> [LAUGH] And\nthen we can find our product.\n\n938\n00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,535\nSo you've gotta, let's see,\ndesktop graphics.\n\n939\n00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:51,800\n>> Radeon HD.\n\n940\n00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,571\n>> Oh, you didn't say it was an HD.\n\n941\n00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:55,910\nHD.\nThat changes everything.\n\n942\n00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,150\n>> And it is a six series.\n\n943\n00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,940\n>> Really?\nYou do know the 7000 series is out now.\n\n944\n00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,266\n>> I know and I'm going to.\n\n945\n00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,260\nI need to upgrade.\n\n946\n00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,240\nI need to get more, too.\n\n947\n00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,320\n>> I don't see how you're getting by\nrunning on a 6000 when the 7000's are out.\n\n948\n00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,160\n>> Thanks, Don.\n\n949\n00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,542\n>> Is this a legacy show,\nor are we reviewing?\n\n950\n00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:16,690\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, oh, oh, man.\n\n951\n00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,970\n>> You cannot stay up to\ndate with graphics hardware.\n\n952\n00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,830\nNew stuff comes out every month.\n\n953\n00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,160\n>> All right, so there we go.\n\n954\n00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,105\nThere's that, so\n\n955\n00:44:24,105 --> 00:44:26,420\nwe've got now the AMD stuff\n>> You know, AMD stuff.\n\n956\n00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,400\nThey have this Catalyst Suite and\n\n957\n00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,710\nit adds all this neat stuff where\nyou can configure things and\n\n958\n00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:37,550\ndo specific stuff to your graphics card\nand run different profiles to games or\n\n959\n00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,705\napplications or whatever and fine-tune\nit to what you're wanting to do with it.\n\n960\n00:44:41,705 --> 00:44:43,560\n>> Mm-hm\n>> There we go.\n\n961\n00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,520\n>> Now which do you run at home?\n\n962\n00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,420\nDo you run the Catalyst Suite, or\ndid you do just the pared down driver?\n\n963\n00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,810\n>> No,\nI installed the whole suite on there.\n\n964\n00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,750\n>> Actually, do they have the pared\ndown driver, if you scroll down?\n\n965\n00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:58,090\nThey used to do it where they\nhad a driver only link and\n\n966\n00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:59,870\nI don't think they do that anymore.\n\n967\n00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:02,340\nAll right, so\nit used to be a big difference, right?\n\n968\n00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,460\nCuz the Catalyst Control Suite,\nit's what, 130 megs but\n\n969\n00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,050\nthen the driver itself\nwill be like 2 megs.\n\n970\n00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,885\n>> Yeah, yeah,\n>> So, they used to have where you could\n\n971\n00:45:10,885 --> 00:45:13,235\ndownload just the driver and\nnot the rest of the suite, but\n\n972\n00:45:13,235 --> 00:45:17,505\nthe rest of the suite, it's got stuff\nin there like, what do they call it?\n\n973\n00:45:17,505 --> 00:45:20,355\nThe color synchronization for\nyour monitor, what's that called?\n\n974\n00:45:20,355 --> 00:45:23,505\n>> Mm, I know what you're talking about,\nbut I don't.\n\n975\n00:45:23,505 --> 00:45:25,680\n>> Different monitors display\ncolors a little bit differently,\n\n976\n00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,035\nso they normally have calibration.\n\n977\n00:45:27,035 --> 00:45:31,410\nThat's it, calibration software where you\ncan tweak it so that red is red enough and\n\n978\n00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,270\nblue is blue enough for your screen.\n\n979\n00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,160\nYou may need that.\n\n980\n00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,240\nIf you're hardcore gamer like Nate.\n\n981\n00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then you probably have it.\n\n982\n00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,645\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, utilities like fan control.\n\n983\n00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:42,470\n>> iFinity?\n\n984\n00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,800\n>> Oh, yes, yes.\n\n985\n00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,260\nI do run iFinity.\n\n986\n00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,420\nI just got that stuff built into it.\n\n987\n00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,260\nIt's pretty sweet.\n\n988\n00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,610\nHey, Don, hows your iFinity set up?\n\n989\n00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,514\n>> Well, no no, see we're not\ntalking about my systems, Nate.\n\n990\n00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:54,910\nWe're talking about yours.\n\n991\n00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,660\nOne of the conversations we were\nhaving before the break, Nate and\n\n992\n00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,600\nI both bought Crisis 2, right?\n\n993\n00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,993\nWhich is a little dated now\ncuz I think Crisis 3 is out.\n\n994\n00:46:04,993 --> 00:46:07,215\nAnd he was playing and\nhe recorded a video and\n\n995\n00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:11,360\nhe's got everything on the high\nquality setting, so it looks great.\n\n996\n00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,800\nMeanwhile I'm running it on my laptop\non the lowest setting as possible and\n\n997\n00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,310\nit's a big difference.\n\n998\n00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,930\nAnd my video card driver just isn't, or\n\n999\n00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,470\nmy video card isn't capable\nof doing what yours is.\n\n1000\n00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,050\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1001\n00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,641\n>> But-\n>> Yep, that's too bad.\n\n1002\n00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:26,450\nI hear that a lot.\n[LAUGH] All right, yep.\n\n1003\n00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,690\nSo there we go.\n\n1004\n00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:28,382\nDrivers and stuff.\n\n1005\n00:46:28,382 --> 00:46:30,425\n>> So\nbasically you reach out to your vendors.\n\n1006\n00:46:30,425 --> 00:46:33,056\nNow, I will tell you that if you buy a,\n\n1007\n00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:39,079\nlet's say I buy a pre-built Dell system\nthat has an ATI Radeon 6950 in it, right?\n\n1008\n00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:40,622\nIf they still even make that.\n\n1009\n00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:43,600\nSo I buy a Dell that\nhas that built into it.\n\n1010\n00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,030\nI can go to Dell's website and\ndownload the driver.\n\n1011\n00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,590\nOr I can go to ATI's website and\ndownload the driver, all right?\n\n1012\n00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,970\nWhich is better?\n\n1013\n00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,520\nWell, it's kinda up to you.\n\n1014\n00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,570\nIf you go to Dell's website and\nget it, you know that you will have\n\n1015\n00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:02,410\nthe driver that they've tested and\ncertified as stable, all right?\n\n1016\n00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,150\nBut if you go to ATI, or AMD,\nyou'll know that you have the latest and\n\n1017\n00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,795\ngreatest driver that may unlock\npotential additional features or\n\n1018\n00:47:09,795 --> 00:47:12,540\nfunctionality performance that\nyou don't get in the other one.\n\n1019\n00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,790\nSo, it's kind of up to you\nhow to you want to go.\n\n1020\n00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,000\nDo you want to go bleeding edge?\n\n1021\n00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,090\nIf so, go to the actual\nmanufacturer of your video card, or\n\n1022\n00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,600\nnetwork card or whatever.\n\n1023\n00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,150\nIf you want stability,\ngo to the vendor for your system.\n\n1024\n00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,480\nDell, or HP, or Lenovo.\n\n1025\n00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,970\nIf you built it yourself,\n\n1026\n00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,650\nyou build your own system, then just go\nto the vendor of the individual hardware.\n\n1027\n00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,950\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n1028\n00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:34,450\nYep.\n>> So.\n\n1029\n00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,261\n>> I agree.\n\n1030\n00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:35,851\n>> All right,\n\n1031\n00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:39,218\nwell I'm downloading that chipset\ndriver in the background here,\n\n1032\n00:47:39,218 --> 00:47:42,540\nand Dell is taking a little white,\nso it's kinda crawling along.\n\n1033\n00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,516\nSo why don't we do this?\n\n1034\n00:47:43,516 --> 00:47:44,839\nWhy don't we stop here and take our break?\n\n1035\n00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:45,559\nWhen we get back,\n\n1036\n00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:48,727\nthat driver will be done and I'll show\ninstalling it and then what it looks like\n\n1037\n00:47:48,727 --> 00:47:51,690\nin our device manager, and all that,\nand we'll get a chance to see it.\n\n1038\n00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,550\n>> Nice.\n>> Anything else\n\n1039\n00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:53,500\nto add before we go to break?\n\n1040\n00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,080\n>> I'm good.\n\n1041\n00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,140\n>> All right, let's stop here.\n\n1042\n00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,051\nWe'll be back in a few minutes.\n\n1043\n00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:06,220\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1044\n00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,302\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So so\n\n1045\n00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,822\nbefore the break I was talking about my\nsystem and how I'm missing some drivers,\n\n1046\n00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:12,390\nand so we're going to fix that out.\n\n1047\n00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,390\nI went to Dell's website and I, very\nslowly downloaded it during the break.\n\n1048\n00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,405\nBut it is downloaded now.\n\n1049\n00:48:17,405 --> 00:48:19,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And and so I'm ready to,\n\n1050\n00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,870\nto jump in there and tackle that one.\n\n1051\n00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,472\nSo let's let's take a look at my device\nmanager again before we get started.\n\n1052\n00:48:24,472 --> 00:48:25,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1053\n00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:30,290\n>> Cuz I am, I am sort of making a,\na guess, assumption, whatever here.\n\n1054\n00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:34,270\nBecause when I go into my device manager,\nI have a PCI data acquisition and\n\n1055\n00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,930\nsignal processing controller.\n\n1056\n00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:36,470\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1057\n00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,200\n>> Which just sounds like something\nthat's built into the motherboard.\n\n1058\n00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,990\nAnything with a PCI bust typically is.\n\n1059\n00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:44,740\nAnd then I've got eight unknown devices.\n\n1060\n00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,070\nNow that doesn't help me.\n\n1061\n00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,100\nI don't know what the unknown device is\nand they don't even give you any ID's or\n\n1062\n00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,440\nanything to go off of.\n\n1063\n00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,910\nSo, the safe assumption on this is that\nI need to load my chip set driver.\n\n1064\n00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:58,701\nAnd it's like Nate, Nate said it's usually\none of the first things we load cuz it,\n\n1065\n00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:03,150\nit does knock off a ton of the, the items\nthat are misidentified by your system.\n\n1066\n00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,870\nSo I went to Dell and here's my chip set\ndriver that I downloaded from them, and\n\n1067\n00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:12,000\nI'm just going to double click on that,\nand with Dell,\n\n1068\n00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,772\nthey have a nice little installer, right?\n\n1069\n00:49:13,772 --> 00:49:17,060\nSo so\nI'm going to choose to use that installer.\n\n1070\n00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,720\nYou don't have to, you actually could\nextract these to a location on the hard\n\n1071\n00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,830\ndrive if you were going to use\nthe PnP utility you'd need to that.\n\n1072\n00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,560\nAnd I believe as part of the install\nit's going to do that anyway.\n\n1073\n00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,820\nBut but it is gonna go ahead and\ninstall it for me.\n\n1074\n00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,962\nSo.\nI'm gonna go ahead and click on install,\n\n1075\n00:49:30,962 --> 00:49:31,770\nor I will try to.\n\n1076\n00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:33,730\nOkay.\n\n1077\n00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:34,450\nDid I?\n\n1078\n00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,420\nI did, I'm being impatient here.\n\n1079\n00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,912\nSo I've, I've now clicked like 17 times.\n\n1080\n00:49:38,912 --> 00:49:43,090\nSo I,\nI do need to reel it in a bit I suppose.\n\n1081\n00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:43,896\nGee, what is going on?\n\n1082\n00:49:46,868 --> 00:49:48,936\nMy impatience.\n\n1083\n00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:53,515\n[LAUGH] Alright, now I just have to wait,\nso it is running in the background and\n\n1084\n00:49:53,515 --> 00:49:58,447\ndrivers often do this, where, the system\nmay seem to stop responding and what\n\n1085\n00:49:58,447 --> 00:50:03,472\nit is actually tied to in a lot of cases\nis Windows redoing hardware detection.\n\n1086\n00:50:03,472 --> 00:50:07,710\nThat's a very intensive process, and so\nit can seem like your computer freezes.\n\n1087\n00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:10,060\nMine hasn't frozen because\nI can still move my mouse.\n\n1088\n00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,695\nThat, that helps,\n>> There it goes.\n\n1089\n00:50:11,695 --> 00:50:14,453\n>> and if I'm a man with more patience,\nI could have waited and, and\n\n1090\n00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:15,690\nhere's my little pop-up.\n\n1091\n00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:20,280\nSo, although I downloaded it from Dell,\nyou'll see this is an Intel chip set.\n\n1092\n00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,070\nThat's, you know?\n\n1093\n00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,150\nI've got an Intel I7, motherboard here.\n\n1094\n00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,160\nSo.\n\n1095\n00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,840\nSo that's, or, an I7 processor board.\n\n1096\n00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,130\nSo, so it is from Intel.\n\n1097\n00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,260\nI'll go ahead and hit next, and\nI'll agree to their licensing agreement.\n\n1098\n00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,370\nAnd then it just gives me\nthe little change log, so\n\n1099\n00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,340\nI can see what's new in\nthis version of the driver.\n\n1100\n00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,704\nIt looks like a nice easy read.\n\n1101\n00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:40,685\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's probably only 80 pages or so.\n\n1102\n00:50:40,685 --> 00:50:43,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll hit next on that.\n\n1103\n00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,370\nAnd now it's starting the install, okay.\n\n1104\n00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,140\nSo, here it goes,\n\n1105\n00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,860\nit's loading some USB drivers apparently\n>> Huh?\n\n1106\n00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,240\n>> A few other things.\n\n1107\n00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,655\nDoesn't seem to load as much, does it?\n\n1108\n00:50:52,655 --> 00:50:54,270\n>> Ah,it sure didn't, did it?\n\n1109\n00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,500\n>> Yeah.\n\n1110\n00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,250\nAll right, so\nwe'll let that finish up, huh, and\n\n1111\n00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,520\nat the end of the day,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1112\n00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,450\n>> yeah it didn't\n\n1113\n00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,135\nit didn't really do anything for\nme, did it?\n\n1114\n00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:06,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So my chipset driver was not my issue\n\n1115\n00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,680\napparently, let me just,\nI'm gonna do a little refresh here.\n\n1116\n00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,710\nAnd if you ever wanna refresh you can\njust right click on your computer up top.\n\n1117\n00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,740\nAnd choose scan for hardware changes.\n\n1118\n00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,230\nAnd I'll just hit that and\nit'll see if it located anything new.\n\n1119\n00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:22,210\nAnd yeah, yeah chip set was not\nmy not my missing entity here.\n\n1120\n00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:26,310\nSo, at this point, I need to start looking\nat the other drivers that Dell expects me\n\n1121\n00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,930\nto have on my system.\n\n1122\n00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,680\nThere was that thermal driver.\n\n1123\n00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,330\nSo I can, I can go ahead and\ngrab that one.\n\n1124\n00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:34,925\nHopefully it'll download faster\nthan than the other one did.\n\n1125\n00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,115\nSo let me just jump down and get it.\n\n1126\n00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:39,092\n>> That's crazy,\n\n1127\n00:51:39,092 --> 00:51:42,995\nthat I'm sure that chip set driver\nwould've just mailed all those out.\n\n1128\n00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:45,295\n>> Typically it does but in this case,\n\n1129\n00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:49,130\napparently I've got something else\ngoing on so let me, let me download.\n\n1130\n00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,370\nOh, and here's a, a neat example, so\nhere they're giving me two choices,\n\n1131\n00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:56,690\none is to download an update package and\none is to download a hard drive file.\n\n1132\n00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,420\nSo the hard drive file is the one that's\ndesigned to extract the hard drive.\n\n1133\n00:51:59,420 --> 00:51:59,990\nWh, what?\n\n1134\n00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:02,140\n>> Look at the, the name on that,\nit's, hard drive DPTF.\n\n1135\n00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,470\n>> That was the driver I pulled out\nof the driver store for the example.\n\n1136\n00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:07,930\n>> The thermal framework.\n\n1137\n00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:08,980\nNow we.\n>> Thermal framework.\n\n1138\n00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,100\n>> Now we know what that stands for.\n\n1139\n00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,010\nDell platform, something or another.\n\n1140\n00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,020\nAnyhow, I'm going to use\nthe update package here.\n\n1141\n00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,630\nWhich is better for installing in Windows,\nyou can install it, you know, and\n\n1142\n00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,690\nit doesn't make you reboot or anything.\n\n1143\n00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,280\nSo we'll load that driver next.\n\n1144\n00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,480\n>> That was a small one.\n\n1145\n00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,810\n>> Yeah,\nit's downloading a little bit faster.\n\n1146\n00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:27,040\n20, we can, we can wait 20 seconds.\n\n1147\n00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,030\nIt'll be okay.\n\n1148\n00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,540\nSo, so we'll get that one loaded.\n\n1149\n00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,060\nNow, a better me,\nwhen I installed this laptop,\n\n1150\n00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,870\nwould have kept track of what\ndrivers I installed, but I didn't.\n\n1151\n00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:37,220\nSo so\nI may already have this driver installed.\n\n1152\n00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,690\nApparently I already had\nthe chip set driver installed.\n\n1153\n00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:44,140\nSo we'll get it installed and and\nwe'll see if that corrects us.\n\n1154\n00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,850\nSo, I'm keeping note here,\njust to remember that I had the PCI,\n\n1155\n00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:53,550\ndevice driver that was missing and\nthen eight unknown devices so\n\n1156\n00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,730\nwe'll get this one loaded and see if any\nof those devices correct themselves.\n\n1157\n00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:01,370\nSo here it goes doing the dynamic\nplatform and thermal framework.\n\n1158\n00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:03,353\nThat's what that stood for.\n\n1159\n00:53:03,353 --> 00:53:03,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1160\n00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:08,298\n>> So then, alright so,\nin our subobjectives, we have to restart?\n\n1161\n00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:10,245\n>> I'm not going to, but\nit's saying it wants me to.\n\n1162\n00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:10,974\n>> Hm.\n\n1163\n00:53:10,974 --> 00:53:13,227\nSo in our, our subobjectives, right?\n\n1164\n00:53:13,227 --> 00:53:18,790\nWe have update drivers, so this way,\nyou know, qualify for that rate.\n\n1165\n00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:19,501\nUpdate.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1166\n00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:23,770\n>> Why, yes, update nonexistent drivers\nthat work on there in the first place.\n\n1167\n00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,317\nBut but, same kind of process,\nyou know, you can go through and\n\n1168\n00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:28,835\nupdate stuff that way, or\n>> Yeah.\n\n1169\n00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:30,400\n>> using device manager me.\n\n1170\n00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,418\n>> Jumping,\njumping back to my Device Manager here,\n\n1171\n00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:37,661\nI just loaded that platform driver and\nit knocked out all nine of the things that\n\n1172\n00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:42,250\nwere missing, the, the PCI interface and\nthe, eight other unknown devices.\n\n1173\n00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:46,320\nSo those unknown devices were probably\ntemperature sensors located throughout\n\n1174\n00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,850\nthe laptop,\n\n1175\n00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,550\nand that's why the thermal framework,\npicked them up and now they're all gone.\n\n1176\n00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,170\nSo, so\nthat was the driver that I'm missing and\n\n1177\n00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,330\nin fact I do see a sensors item now.\n\n1178\n00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:59,520\nAnd I've got a, human interface device\nsensor, simple devisor orientation sensor,\n\n1179\n00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,740\nthat's the, gyroscope,\nor whatever it's called.\n\n1180\n00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,170\nSo so anyhow,\nthat's not the thermal stuff,\n\n1181\n00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,850\nthat'll have to be in here somewhere else.\n\n1182\n00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,410\nBut, but anyhow, so that,\nthat was the one that was missing.\n\n1183\n00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,850\nAnd it's corrected it,\nI can see it all on my drivers are happy.\n\n1184\n00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,795\nBut what Nate was saying was,\njust because your drivers are happy,\n\n1185\n00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:18,700\ncuz it all detected, doesn't mean you're\nrunning the latest and greatest, so\n\n1186\n00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,205\nwe might need to update, right?\n\n1187\n00:54:20,205 --> 00:54:21,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1188\n00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,700\nvideo card drivers are the critical ones.\n\n1189\n00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,345\nIf you wanna play, if you wanna play your\nvideo games on the high settings you know,\n\n1190\n00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:28,930\nyou, you gotta have up to date drivers.\n\n1191\n00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:30,180\n>> Yeah, video drivers.\n\n1192\n00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,080\nYeah, goodness.\n\n1193\n00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,810\nThose those update quite often.\n\n1194\n00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:37,940\nYou know, a big fancy new game releases,\nand it it just seems to come along with\n\n1195\n00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,520\ngraphics drivers, and\ngraphics driver profiles to run that game.\n\n1196\n00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,090\nSo, it yeah.\n\n1197\n00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:43,930\nVideo drivers.\n\n1198\n00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,070\n>> So I've got a driver here.\n\n1199\n00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,740\nThis is the Intel HD Graphics 4000.\n\n1200\n00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,200\nAnd it says,\nMicrosoft corporation WDDM beside it, and\n\n1201\n00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,790\nthat means that this is a driver,\nfrom Microsoft,\n\n1202\n00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,650\nnot from the vendor,\nnot from Intel, but from Microsoft.\n\n1203\n00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:01,550\nThey've certified it, tested it,\nand built it into Windows.\n\n1204\n00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:04,190\nSo, if I want to update it,\nI gotta couple of choices.\n\n1205\n00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,580\nI can use the built-in update,\n\n1206\n00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,732\nwhich we'll try to look to Microsoft to\nsee if there's an update out there or,\n\n1207\n00:55:08,732 --> 00:55:12,560\nI can just go to Intel's website and\ndownload the latest and greatest.\n\n1208\n00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,000\nKind of, kind of up to me.\n\n1209\n00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,320\nSo I'm going to pull up its,\nwell I'll do it this way.\n\n1210\n00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,970\nYou can pull up its properties and\nyou got an update button in there but\n\n1211\n00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:23,770\nthere's also update driver software\njust as an option right here and I'll,\n\n1212\n00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,670\nI'll go ahead and choose that.\n\n1213\n00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:25,777\nIt's the same thing.\n\n1214\n00:55:25,777 --> 00:55:26,830\n>> Mm.\n[COUGH]\n\n1215\n00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:28,373\n>> If you've already downloaded,\n\n1216\n00:55:28,373 --> 00:55:32,170\nthe newer driver, then you can pick right\nhere to browse and find it, or you can let\n\n1217\n00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,989\nWindows try and search and find it, and\nthat's what I'll do, and let it search.\n\n1218\n00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:39,836\nNow it will search Windows update, so\nif it's a built in Microsoft driver,\n\n1219\n00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,553\nit might find the update out\nthere on Windows update.\n\n1220\n00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:46,907\nIt will not search Intel's website or\nDell's website or whatever.\n\n1221\n00:55:46,907 --> 00:55:50,149\nSo if you're getting it from the vendor\nthe update button's not going to do you\n\n1222\n00:55:50,149 --> 00:55:50,775\na lot of good.\n\n1223\n00:55:50,775 --> 00:55:51,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1224\n00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,860\nNow I know, I know we're going to save,\ngroup policy for\n\n1225\n00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,600\none magical special show [LAUGH] where\nwe'll get all of it done at, at once.\n\n1226\n00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,810\nBut on a, oh there it goes,\nfound something.\n\n1227\n00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,220\nSo, you know, what we can do is set up a,\na policy so that when you know,\n\n1228\n00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,940\nwhen Windows does look for an updated\ndriver we can specify certain folders and\n\n1229\n00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:16,830\nareas, like on a,\na network share that it checks first.\n\n1230\n00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,060\nSo if you know, we're regulating\ndrivers or for whatever reason,\n\n1231\n00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:24,040\nthen you know we can kinda control The,\nwhat it picks up.\n\n1232\n00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,240\n>> Yea.\nAnd again, you know,\n\n1233\n00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,870\nif you have one computer like this\nit's easy enough for me to go and\n\n1234\n00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:28,370\ndo the update.\n\n1235\n00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,220\nBut what if you have a thousand computers,\n\n1236\n00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,530\nwhat if you have five thousand computers\nand they're spread across ten locations.\n\n1237\n00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:34,990\nIt becomes a lot more difficult to manage,\nand\n\n1238\n00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,310\nthat's where the group\npolicy stuff comes in.\n\n1239\n00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:41,450\nAlright, it did find an update,\nit updated my driver.\n\n1240\n00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:42,750\nI can see the WDDM.\n\n1241\n00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,680\nFlag went away, and\nI know what's going on here,\n\n1242\n00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,660\nI had loaded the actual intel driver\nat one point and so it's found that and\n\n1243\n00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,930\nswitched us back so how do I know I'm\nnot running the Microsoft one anymore?\n\n1244\n00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:56,298\nThe WDDM part is done and\nif I go to properties,\n\n1245\n00:56:56,298 --> 00:57:01,010\nI can go, well right here it says\nmanufacturer intel that's one hint, and\n\n1246\n00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:05,210\nif I go under driver,\ndriver provider Intel Corporation.\n\n1247\n00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,550\nAnd here's my driver details.\n\n1248\n00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:12,580\nNow, my driver is only 9.17,\nreleased on September 2nd, 2012.\n\n1249\n00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,780\nSo, so, it's a year old.\n\n1250\n00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,660\nThis is an old drive, in my opinion.\n\n1251\n00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,460\nSo, there's probably\na newer drive out there.\n\n1252\n00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,240\nIt didn't find it.\n\n1253\n00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,340\nThe system didn't find it automatically,\nso I may need to go to that vendor site.\n\n1254\n00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,420\nRight, so, let, let's do that\njust as part of our update here.\n\n1255\n00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:32,654\nI'll go to Intel.com And\n\n1256\n00:57:32,654 --> 00:57:39,450\nwe need support, and\nI want downloads and drivers.\n\n1257\n00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,770\nAlright, so I'm gonna go in here, and\n\n1258\n00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:46,000\nI'm gonna tell it what kind\nof video card that I've got.\n\n1259\n00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,850\nSo I need to tell it that I'm looking for,\ngraphics, and that is laptop graphics.\n\n1260\n00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,340\nAnd, it is a, what it is a?\n\n1261\n00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:56,900\n>> Third- gen-.\n\n1262\n00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,060\n>> Third gen.\n\n1263\n00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,560\nThe fourth generation, I got to get to\nrid of this, I've had this laptop for\n\n1264\n00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,940\n6 months now,\nI need to buy a new one already.\n\n1265\n00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,010\n>> Yeah, heaven's sakes, I know,\n\n1266\n00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,470\nyour graphics is a little\nbehind the times here Don.\n\n1267\n00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,675\n>> I tell you, this is our legacy show.\n\n1268\n00:58:10,675 --> 00:58:13,740\n[LAUGH] Technology is over 6 months old.\n\n1269\n00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,410\nSo I am going to go in here and\njust tell it That I have Windows 8,\n\n1270\n00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,800\n64 bit, and that I'm looking for drivers.\n\n1271\n00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,170\nAnd then, down here we can\nfind the Intel drivers here,\n\n1272\n00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,020\nIntel HD graphics driver for\nWindows 7 and Windows 8.\n\n1273\n00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:32,420\nNow the driver that I have was\ndated from September of 2012.\n\n1274\n00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:37,660\nI can see a driver here from March\nof 2013, so that's definitely newer.\n\n1275\n00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,890\nAnd then there's this, Intel Iris.\n\n1276\n00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,890\nI'm not familiar with it,\ndo you know what Intel Iris is?\n\n1277\n00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,650\n>> Mmm mm.\n\n1278\n00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:47,190\n>> Intel Iris and HD Graphics drivers so\nmaybe it's another type of video card.\n\n1279\n00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,120\nBut it's in the same Chain.\n\n1280\n00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,450\nSee how you got 15.31.3.64,\nthis one's 15.31.9.64.\n\n1281\n00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:57,805\nSo it is newer, so\nI'll go with the new one.\n\n1282\n00:58:57,805 --> 00:59:00,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1283\n00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,040\n>> Hm.\nIris must be another code name for\n\n1284\n00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,420\ngraphics cards.\n\n1285\n00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,410\nAnd looks like I got a choice here,\nwhat is my choice?\n\n1286\n00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:09,900\nThey both look the same, don't they?\n\n1287\n00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,720\nThat's as big as the, Catalyst suite.\n\n1288\n00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,490\n>> It's very big, isn't it?\n\n1289\n00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:16,528\n>> 147 megs.\n\n1290\n00:59:16,528 --> 00:59:19,350\n>> So, So\nthere's two options to download and\n\n1291\n00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,570\nin looking at them, normally you can\nsee a description what's different.\n\n1292\n00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,560\nThese are\n>> One's an EXE,\n\n1293\n00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,150\none's a zip\n>> Yeah I guess\n\n1294\n00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,210\nthat's the only difference.\n\n1295\n00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,510\nAnd the zip's not much smaller.\n\n1296\n00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:31,827\nSo we'll download the XP why not.\n\n1297\n00:59:31,827 --> 00:59:33,240\n>> Mhm..\n>> So we'll go ahead and\n\n1298\n00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,830\ndownload it why not.\n\n1299\n00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,010\nSo that's my actual latest video card.\n\n1300\n00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,700\nSo I can download, or video hard driver\nI can download that and install it and\n\n1301\n00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,730\nI won't make us wait for\n148 megs to download.\n\n1302\n00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:43,420\nThat's no fun.\n\n1303\n00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,780\nSo anyhow,\nthat's kind of how we can do an update.\n\n1304\n00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,880\nNow, let's say I do the update and\nthings break, things don't work.\n\n1305\n00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,070\nRight now I have a mess.\n\n1306\n00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:53,720\nSo what do I do then?\n\n1307\n00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,720\nWell we can roll on roll on,\nwe can roll on to rolling back a driver.\n\n1308\n00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,410\n>> Whoa.\n\n1309\n00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:00,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Good, good transition.\n\n1310\n01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,260\n>> Oh, thank you.\n\n1311\n01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,780\nSo you know actually yeah.\n\n1312\n01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,090\nYour display adapter.\n\n1313\n01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,590\nSince you updated the,\nthe driver on that one, that would be a,\n\n1314\n01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,810\na good choice to show the rollback.\n\n1315\n01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:13,010\nFunction, we can go into\nthe driver properties,\n\n1316\n01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,940\nas before, and in there,\nwill be an option.\n\n1317\n01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:21,385\nSo we have driver detail,\nupdated driver, and roll back a driver.\n\n1318\n01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:22,100\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So\n\n1319\n01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:26,240\nlet's say, if your displayed data\nstarts acting crazy, or funky, or\n\n1320\n01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,800\nwhat not we have the option to\n>> Roll it back to the driver\n\n1321\n01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,110\nthat you had on there previously,\nby using this, right here.\n\n1322\n01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:36,230\n>> Yup, Windows always saves\nthe last version of your driver.\n\n1323\n01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:40,430\nSo when you update, it actually keeps\na copy of the old one just in case and\n\n1324\n01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,940\nwe can hit rollback and\nthat will jump us back to the old one,\n\n1325\n01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,830\nwhich is going to take me from the Intel\ndriver back to the Microsoft driver.\n\n1326\n01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,670\nAnd I'll see that name of\nthe adapter has changed again.\n\n1327\n01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,700\nNow it's back to saying\nMicrosoft Corporation WDDM, So\n\n1328\n01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,160\nI know that it's back to\nthe official Microsoft one.\n\n1329\n01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,880\n>> Eh, and now your rollback button is,\nis grayed out so\n\n1330\n01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,580\nyou can't roll back, I guess,\npast your original driver.\n\n1331\n01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,230\n>> Yeah, I don't,\nI don't have any others, so.\n\n1332\n01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,430\n>> Mm- hmm.\n\n1333\n01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:11,095\nNice.\nWell, yeah, that, So yeah.\n\n1334\n01:01:11,095 --> 01:01:11,705\nSo there you go.\n\n1335\n01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:15,545\nNow okay, so what if you, like,\nyou updated your display driver.\n\n1336\n01:01:15,545 --> 01:01:19,230\nLet's say your computer blue screens,\nand you can't get back into this.\n\n1337\n01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,695\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Into this this window, then what?\n\n1338\n01:01:21,695 --> 01:01:22,465\n>> You know, good point,\n\n1339\n01:01:22,465 --> 01:01:24,780\ncuz if it's your sound card\n>> Big deal.\n\n1340\n01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,570\nYou just can't hear until you fix\nthe problem or if it's your network card,\n\n1341\n01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:30,750\nyou can go and get drivers from somewhere\nelse and bring them over on a USB key or\n\n1342\n01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,620\nwhatever but, if it's your video card and\nyou can't even see what's going on, that,\n\n1343\n01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,770\nthat's pretty bad.\n\n1344\n01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:39,350\nSo that's where you use your\nF8 recovery menu Right?\n\n1345\n01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,730\n>> Huh.\n>> You reboot your computer and\n\n1346\n01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:46,070\nyou tap F8 on your keyboard while it's\nbooting up, and you get two choices.\n\n1347\n01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,460\nWith the video card,\n\n1348\n01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:52,360\nit's actually usually easiest just to\nchoose the VGA mode option, right?\n\n1349\n01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,720\nI think it actually just says VGA mode.\n\n1350\n01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,620\nAnd that will boot without\na video card driver, right?\n\n1351\n01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,750\nAnd so you'll load a lower resolution\nScreen, but at least you can see and\n\n1352\n01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,465\nfix the problem.\n\n1353\n01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:02,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1354\n01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:03,450\nYup.\n\n1355\n01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:08,380\nYeah system restore, I guess in\nsome extreme cases last known good.\n\n1356\n01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,980\nBut yeah.\nSo your advanced startup options\n\n1357\n01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:15,730\nwould be the way to get in there and roll\nit back that way in case thing got fouled.\n\n1358\n01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,150\n>> All right.\n\n1359\n01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,540\nLet's see Nate what,\nwhat else do we have on drivers,\n\n1360\n01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,920\nit's a pretty good run on there.\n\n1361\n01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,060\n>> Yeah well yeah.\n\n1362\n01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:28,171\nWell we just need to touch on disabling\na driver and uninstalling a driver,\n\n1363\n01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:32,300\nwhich conveniently was in the screen\nthat we wer, were just in.\n\n1364\n01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,580\n>> Let's pick something other than my\ndisplay adapter though because I don't\n\n1365\n01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:39,150\nwant to I don't want to drop that so\n>> We'll take one of my network\n\n1366\n01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,850\nadaptors, right?\n\n1367\n01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:41,140\nLike like Bluetooth.\n\n1368\n01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:41,730\n>> Bluetooth.\n\n1369\n01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,390\n>> Alright?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1370\n01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:49,185\n>> So, lets says that I absolutely don't\nwant to use Bluetooth on my system.\n\n1371\n01:02:49,185 --> 01:02:49,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1372\n01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,398\n>> Okay?\nI don't want to use it.\n\n1373\n01:02:51,398 --> 01:02:52,663\nI got two choices.\n\n1374\n01:02:52,663 --> 01:02:54,997\nChoice number one is I\ncould uninstall the driver.\n\n1375\n01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:58,967\nAnd then I'll have hardware that's not\nfunctional cuz the driver is missing.\n\n1376\n01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:02,380\nBut who knows a windows update could\nhappen down the road or whatever.\n\n1377\n01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:05,970\nThe driver gets loaded and all of a sudden\nthis hardware is enabled again, So\n\n1378\n01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:08,140\nthe better option is the second option.\n\n1379\n01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:11,710\nWhich is to actually disable\nthe hardware in the device manager.\n\n1380\n01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:14,950\nIf I know for a fact that I am\nnever gonna use Bluetooth and\n\n1381\n01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:19,410\nI don't want the security risk of having\nBluetooth even accidentally enabled.\n\n1382\n01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:23,110\nI can come into the device manager and\nyou can do it two ways.\n\n1383\n01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:26,170\nSo we've got right click and\ndisable, that's one way, or\n\n1384\n01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:30,980\nyou can go into properties and\nunder driver we've also got disable there.\n\n1385\n01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,764\nAlright, what's the difference?\n\n1386\n01:03:31,764 --> 01:03:32,901\nClicks.\n\n1387\n01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:33,668\nOne takes more clicks.\n\n1388\n01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:35,990\nSo, otherwise they're the same.\n\n1389\n01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,582\nSo we can go in and disable that.\n\n1390\n01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:42,342\nAnd that's going to disable it regardless\nof what drivers come in down the road,\n\n1391\n01:03:42,342 --> 01:03:45,780\nit is disabled and\nthat hardware is no longer functional.\n\n1392\n01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,140\n>> Nice.\nYep, and\n\n1393\n01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:52,230\nit looks like it's changed the icon\nas well with the little down arrow,\n\n1394\n01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,540\nshowing that it is disabled.\n\n1395\n01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,960\n>> I know it's really small in\nthe screens for you guys at home.\n\n1396\n01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,286\nIt's really small in real life too.\n\n1397\n01:03:58,286 --> 01:04:00,425\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That arrow is microscopic.\n\n1398\n01:04:00,425 --> 01:04:03,470\nEven if you zoom in it's tiny, so\nthere is a little black arrow.\n\n1399\n01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:05,455\nI will tell you one thing\nthat annoys me though.\n\n1400\n01:04:05,455 --> 01:04:06,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1401\n01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,760\n>> I just manually disabled these, so\nI'm kind of aware that I disabled it.\n\n1402\n01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,320\nBut every time you go in\nto the device manager.\n\n1403\n01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,580\nIf i go back in to the device manager.\n\n1404\n01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,470\nThat folder is always\ngoing to be expanded now.\n\n1405\n01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:23,350\nAlways expanded because it's\ngot disabled items in there.\n\n1406\n01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:26,270\nSo, it's always calling your attention\nto it, to remind you that, oh,\n\n1407\n01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,255\nby the way, you disabled this stuff.\n\n1408\n01:04:28,255 --> 01:04:29,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's annoyed me since, like,\n\n1409\n01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:30,180\nWindows 98.\n\n1410\n01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,670\n>> Right just having an expanded menu?\n\n1411\n01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,195\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1412\n01:04:33,195 --> 01:04:33,850\n>> You know?\n\n1413\n01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:34,770\nI know it's disabled.\n\n1414\n01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,600\nShrink the menu back.\n\n1415\n01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,993\nAnd, I could click it,\n\n1416\n01:04:36,993 --> 01:04:38,052\nbut, whatever.\n\n1417\n01:04:38,052 --> 01:04:38,766\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So.\n\n1418\n01:04:38,766 --> 01:04:39,566\n[LAUGH]\n\n1419\n01:04:39,566 --> 01:04:40,555\n>> That's good.\n\n1420\n01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:43,650\nAll right sailing a driver perhaps if\n\n1421\n01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:48,340\nyou're having to troubleshoot\ndpossible driver related issues\n\n1422\n01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,900\nyou can just start disabling things this\nway rather than uninstalling and having to\n\n1423\n01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:56,310\ngo back do that stuff so you can turn\nthings off that way and test things out.\n\n1424\n01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:58,060\n>> Yeah.\nMm-hm.\n\n1425\n01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,205\nI think the last thing we have\nis like uninstalling a driver.\n\n1426\n01:05:00,205 --> 01:05:00,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1427\n01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,500\n>> Which is not something that\nwe frequently have to do, or\n\n1428\n01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,780\nat least I haven't had to frequently do.\n\n1429\n01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,180\nBut you can.\n\n1430\n01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,980\nIf you've loaded a third party driver,\nfor example, and it just doesn't work,\n\n1431\n01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:15,430\nor maybe it loaded one of those shady\nAndroid drivers you find on XCDA or\n\n1432\n01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:16,290\nwhat was it the other day?\n\n1433\n01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:18,380\nThe, the Playstation three,\nor the Six Access remotes.\n\n1434\n01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, you're trying to-\n\n1435\n01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:21,630\n>> Yeah, it was a motion joy drive.\n\n1436\n01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,310\n>> Yeah so-\n>> I guess to call it out by name.\n\n1437\n01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,420\n>> So you load one of these drivers that\nyou just don't know about but you force it\n\n1438\n01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:30,220\ninto Windows anyway, bypassing\nthe driver security and all that.\n\n1439\n01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:33,860\nYou might want to uninstall it when you're\ndone, and then leave the root kit behind.\n\n1440\n01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:40,660\nSo what you can do is you can go into\nthe device manager and on most of\n\n1441\n01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:44,690\nthese drivers you can go in and just\nright-click on them and choose uninstall.\n\n1442\n01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,400\nAnd what that's gonna do,\nis it's not gonna delete the driver,\n\n1443\n01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,900\nthe driver actually stays.\n\n1444\n01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,320\nBut it uninstalls it from this piece of\nhardware, so when you reboot the computer\n\n1445\n01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:58,190\nnext time it's gonna find there's new\nhardware and locate a new driver for it.\n\n1446\n01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:01,020\nIt may end up putting the old driver\ndriver back in place if that's\n\n1447\n01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:01,740\nthe only one that you have.\n\n1448\n01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:02,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1449\n01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:05,150\n>> So\nlike if I uninstall my graphics driver.\n\n1450\n01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:05,960\nLet's see what this does.\n\n1451\n01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,550\nThis will be fun.\n\n1452\n01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,320\n>> Huh.\n>> Now it completely disappeared.\n\n1453\n01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:15,050\nSo now the display is completely gone and\nif I reboot,\n\n1454\n01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:18,370\nit's going to say new hardware\ndetected and it's going to find it and\n\n1455\n01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:24,720\nit's going to load a new graphics driver\nand I could take that Intel driver.\n\n1456\n01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,010\nWhere did that download to?\n\n1457\n01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:35,182\nThere this one, I can take that intel\ndriver and I can pre stage it using\n\n1458\n01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:40,790\nPNP util and after I do that when\nI reboot and find new hardware,\n\n1459\n01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:44,680\nit'll see this driver is the latest\none and launch it and get it in place.\n\n1460\n01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:49,723\nSo that's something that I\ncould do if I was so motivated.\n\n1461\n01:06:49,723 --> 01:06:50,566\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1462\n01:06:50,566 --> 01:06:54,022\n>> [LAUGH] Of course, it says I don't\nminimum hardware requirements because it\n\n1463\n01:06:54,022 --> 01:06:55,860\ncan't see the graphics card right now.\n\n1464\n01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,230\nSo, it's upset about that.\n\n1465\n01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,010\nBut-\n>> Actually like a,\n\n1466\n01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:00,725\nthis is like a ticking time bomb.\n\n1467\n01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:04,910\nCuz now when you reboot your computer\nyou won't have that driver in there.\n\n1468\n01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,150\n>> That is true.\n\n1469\n01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:10,880\nBut well it'll just\nload the wddm one back.\n\n1470\n01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,750\nOr I think had the older Intel one too so\nthere's a few things that could happen.\n\n1471\n01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,320\nHold on.\n\n1472\n01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,190\nThere we go.\n\n1473\n01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:24,270\nSo, that Intel driver that I loaded, this\nguy right here, a lot of drivers will have\n\n1474\n01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:30,170\na neat option, and I'm just gonna see\nhere, if I do a slash question mark.\n\n1475\n01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,070\nOh, this one doesn't.\n\n1476\n01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:34,470\nA lot of them will have where you can do,\nlike, a slash x, and they'll extract, and\n\n1477\n01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:37,410\nyou can extract them to the hard drive,\nand then use the PNP utility.\n\n1478\n01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:41,330\nThis one doesn't cuz I downloaded the exe\ninstead of downloading the zip file right.\n\n1479\n01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,960\nThat was the other option when\nI was on the download page.\n\n1480\n01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,490\nAnd if you download the zip\nfile you can extract it and\n\n1481\n01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,360\nthat's where our pnp utility comes in.\n\n1482\n01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,520\nSo, I guess I still have that page open.\n\n1483\n01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,440\nI could switch over to it.\n\n1484\n01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,550\nBut it was a big download so\nI don't know that I want to wait for that.\n\n1485\n01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,050\nNick can you think of\nanything else to throw in?\n\n1486\n01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:02,270\nI think we're pretty good on drivers.\n\n1487\n01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:05,530\n>> Yeah, of course you know,\nif we were running\n\n1488\n01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:09,930\na 64 bit system you need 64 bit drivers,\nand 32 bit, 32 bit drivers.\n\n1489\n01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:11,690\nThey don't mingle back and\n\n1490\n01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:17,560\nforth unlike desktop apps which 32 bit can\nbe installed on 64 bit drivers cannot.\n\n1491\n01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,030\nAnd 64 bit windows\nrequires signed drivers.\n\n1492\n01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,830\nSo if you do have that shady driver\nthat you want to install for\n\n1493\n01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:30,270\nsome reason you have to turn off\ndriver's signature requirement thing and\n\n1494\n01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:32,350\nthat's in the advanced start up options.\n\n1495\n01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,950\n>> Will that show up on the exam?\n\n1496\n01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,110\n>> Or is that just for personal reference?\n\n1497\n01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,680\n>> I'm not sure.\n>> It didn't show up when I took the exam.\n\n1498\n01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,430\n>> Yeah, I remember.\n\n1499\n01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:44,460\n>> So, for those of you that don't\nknow about drivers signing, if you get\n\n1500\n01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:48,390\na root kit or a really bad virus on your\ncomputer it can do a lot of damage, right?\n\n1501\n01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,940\nYour data, or whatever.\n\n1502\n01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:55,240\nWell, fake drivers are one of the best\nways for people to inject rootkits.\n\n1503\n01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:00,110\nAnd so in the 64 bit versions of Windows,\nMicrosoft made it where now it requires\n\n1504\n01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:04,160\nthe drivers to be digitally signed, and\nthat means that a hardware manufacturer or\n\n1505\n01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:10,400\nMicrosoft themselves has scanned over the\ndriver, and created a digital certificate.\n\n1506\n01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,312\nLike an encrypted hash key.\n\n1507\n01:09:12,312 --> 01:09:16,600\nThat says, here's how the driver\nlooked when it was originally made.\n\n1508\n01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,540\nIf anybody tampers with the driver,\nlike modifies its contents.\n\n1509\n01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:24,370\nThe certificate won't match anymore,\nand the driver will be invalid.\n\n1510\n01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:28,460\nSo by loading only digitally\nsigned drivers on your system\n\n1511\n01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:31,370\nyou know that they haven't been\nmodified by any malicious third party.\n\n1512\n01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,230\nYou know that it's safe\nto use on your system.\n\n1513\n01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,990\nIf you want to load hardware written\nby a small company, a company that\n\n1514\n01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:42,660\ncouldn't pay the price to get their\ndrivers digitally signed by Microsoft.\n\n1515\n01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,990\nThen you may get unsigned ones and\nyou see it a lot.\n\n1516\n01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,930\nLike, if you go to the XDA developer\nforums, for Android, right?\n\n1517\n01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:52,270\nYou'll see a lot of drivers on there that\naren't signed, or the Motion Joy for\n\n1518\n01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,950\nthe Six Axis controller where\nit's just not digitally signed.\n\n1519\n01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,490\nYou can disable digital driver signing.\n\n1520\n01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,250\nDisable that requirement and\n\n1521\n01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:04,000\nthen you can load in drivers that\ncould potentially be malicious.\n\n1522\n01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,605\nIf you do that, you've bypassed\na major security restriction\n\n1523\n01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:11,025\nthat Microsoft has put in\nto protect your system.\n\n1524\n01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:13,725\nSo you have weakened\nthe security of your system.\n\n1525\n01:10:13,725 --> 01:10:16,645\nIf you do that it should\nonly be a temporary thing.\n\n1526\n01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:19,592\nMake your changes and\nthen put everything back the way it was,\n\n1527\n01:10:19,592 --> 01:10:23,762\nbut if you run it long-term, you\nare weakening the security of your system.\n\n1528\n01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:29,162\nNow, there is a tool that you can use,\nto scan for unsigned drivers, and\n\n1529\n01:10:29,162 --> 01:10:35,312\nit's called sigverif, S-I-G-V-E-R-F, and\n\n1530\n01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:42,300\nthe sigverif tool will scan your install\ndrivers and look for unsigned drivers.\n\n1531\n01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,680\nThat's a good tool to use that with.\n\n1532\n01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,830\nAnd there's another tool, driverquery.\n\n1533\n01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:51,310\nAnd that searches all your drivers,\nsigned and unsigned.\n\n1534\n01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,305\nAnd of course both tools\nhave different switches\n\n1535\n01:10:54,305 --> 01:10:57,105\nto where you can narrow down\nwhat you want the tool to do.\n\n1536\n01:10:59,025 --> 01:11:03,260\n>> And I'm just, I have almost got\nmy Intel driver extracted here so\n\n1537\n01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,569\nI'm just waiting.\n\n1538\n01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:08,261\nIt's almost done.\n\n1539\n01:11:08,261 --> 01:11:09,979\n97, 99, 100%!\n\n1540\n01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:10,795\nAll right!\n\n1541\n01:11:10,795 --> 01:11:12,685\n>> Woo!\n>> Okay, so\n\n1542\n01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,065\nmy Intel driver finally extracted and\n\n1543\n01:11:15,065 --> 01:11:19,188\nas I look at it here I can see all\nthe stuff that was included with it, and\n\n1544\n01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:24,365\nit's got auto-run files, and it's\ndesigned to use this graphical setup.exe.\n\n1545\n01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:27,920\nBut the actual driver will\nbe in here somewhere, and\n\n1546\n01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,490\nwe can find that INF file,\noops, INF file, there it is.\n\n1547\n01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:43,050\nAnd so, we can use\nthe pnputil-aigdlhc64.inf is that right?\n\n1548\n01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,200\nI wonder what that stands for.\n\n1549\n01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,810\nIntel graphics, something,\nsomething, something, something.\n\n1550\n01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:48,580\n>> Man, yeah yeah yeah.\n\n1551\n01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,740\n>> 64.\nSo [LAUGH], all right, so here we go.\n\n1552\n01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,890\nLet's see if PNP utility works\nout a little better for me.\n\n1553\n01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,650\nThe nice thing here is that I'll\nhave pre-staged the driver.\n\n1554\n01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:00,960\nSo, when the system reboots and\nautomatically detects the video card,\n\n1555\n01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,650\nit'll find this nice,\nlatest driver loaded up.\n\n1556\n01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,510\nAnd be ready to rock.\n\n1557\n01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,240\n>> Hooray!\n>> Yay!\n\n1558\n01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,030\nIt worked!\n\n1559\n01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,560\nAnd you'll see it gave\nit that name of OEM 14.\n\n1560\n01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,910\n>> Oh, yeah.\nThere you go.\n\n1561\n01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:10,585\n>> And, there it is.\n\n1562\n01:12:10,585 --> 01:12:13,850\nSo that's what we were talking about\nat the beginning of the last segment.\n\n1563\n01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:14,910\n>> Nice.\nYou know it's nice,\n\n1564\n01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,190\nyou brought everything back full circle.\n\n1565\n01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,560\nFull circle, that's nice.\n\n1566\n01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,280\nThat was nice Don.\n\n1567\n01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,590\n>> Alright, so so I think that's\nall we've got on drivers, and\n\n1568\n01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:27,970\nNate I know we had on the schedule to\njump into applications today but we went\n\n1569\n01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,610\na little longer on drivers than planned-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1570\n01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:30,930\n>> So this might be a good place to wrap\n\n1571\n01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:31,440\nthis one up-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1572\n01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,030\n>> And then we'll tackle\napplications in the next episode.\n\n1573\n01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:36,520\n>> Yeah.\nCuz I've got some really cool demos for\n\n1574\n01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,660\napplications.\n\n1575\n01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:42,580\nThe whole show's gonna be like one\nbig long massive fun demo of apps and\n\n1576\n01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:46,170\ndesktop apps, and\nrolling stuff out, and doing stuff.\n\n1577\n01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:48,180\nAnd, I'm gonna involve your computer, too.\n\n1578\n01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:51,250\n>> By the the end of the episode,\nwill I be able to play Angry Birds?\n\n1579\n01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:55,250\n>> No, no, no, I do have this\nawesome network game instead.\n\n1580\n01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,207\n>> What?\n\n1581\n01:12:56,207 --> 01:12:57,740\n>> Yeah so we're gonna use it anyways.\n\n1582\n01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,112\nWe're gonna deploy it and\nit's gonna be cool.\n\n1583\n01:12:59,112 --> 01:13:02,390\n>> All right well ladies and gentlemen if\nthat sounds exciting to you absolutely\n\n1584\n01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:06,650\nstay tuned for the next action packed\nadventure filled episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n1585\n01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:11,192\nOtherwise, for today's episode we hope\nyou guys enjoyed drivers as always and\n\n1586\n01:13:11,192 --> 01:13:13,560\nI think that's about all I got.\n\n1587\n01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,170\nSo I'm Don Pezet with IT Pro TV.\n\n1588\n01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:16,180\n>> I'm Nathan Copeland.\n\n1589\n01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,205\n>> And we'll see you next time around.\n\n1590\n01:13:18,205 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,181\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:41,287\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\naccompanied today by Mr. Nate Copeland.\n\n7\n00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:41,844\nHow's it going Nate?\n\n8\n00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:43,050\n>> Pretty good Don.\n\n9\n00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,380\nThank you.\n>> I don't know why I'm talking\n\n10\n00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,237\nfast like we're at some kind\nof cattle auctioneer’s house.\n\n11\n00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:51,060\n[LAUGH] So,\nanyhow welcome back to the show everybody.\n\n12\n00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,860\nWe got a neat one lined up here as we\ncontinue on with our Windows 8 adventure.\n\n13\n00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,090\nLast episode we were tackling hardware and\n\n14\n00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,770\napps, and really last episode was\na little more hardware than apps.\n\n15\n00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,217\n>> So device drivers and\nall that good stuff,\n\n16\n00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:10,680\ngetting things working with our systems.\n\n17\n00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,800\nSo far in the series, so\nwe have installing Windows.\n\n18\n00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,430\nAnd then we have installing drivers,\nso they can work with Windows.\n\n19\n00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,810\nSo now, we can move into\ninstalling apps on Windows.\n\n20\n00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,110\nRight, and start using stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,060\n>> Yeah, cuz if you just have\nthe base operating system,\n\n22\n00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,880\nit gets pretty boring pretty fast.\n\n23\n00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,703\nThere's only so much free cell and\nsolitaire you can play.\n\n24\n00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:34,240\nBefore you need to get something done.\n\n25\n00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,530\n>> Well you got the Internet.\n\n26\n00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,990\n>> Well you do have the Internet,\nthat is a good point.\n\n27\n00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,010\nAnd for\nmany people that's probably enough.\n\n28\n00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,815\nNow we got our, I know you were joking.\n\n29\n00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:42,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But on a serious side,\n\n30\n00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,080\nthere's a lot of people like me.\n\n31\n00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,930\nI use the heck out of Google Docs.\n\n32\n00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,385\nAnd which Microsoft doesn't like to hear.\n\n33\n00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:50,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But so products like that,\n\n34\n00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,139\nwhere you may not need to install any\napplications beyond a web browser.\n\n35\n00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,720\nBut most people aren't held to that.\n\n36\n00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,590\nMost people are going to need more\nthan what's just in the base OS.\n\n37\n00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,060\n>> Yeah, Google Docs,\nI'm more of an Office 365 kind of guy.\n\n38\n00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,892\n>> Big money.\n\n39\n00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:08,808\n>> Okay.\n\n40\n00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:13,220\n[LAUGH] So all right, so yeah, so sweet.\n\n41\n00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,830\nSo installing apps, right?\n\n42\n00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,382\nSo we've got two different\nkinds of apps for Windows 8.\n\n43\n00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:23,930\nWe have desktop apps and\nWindows Store apps.\n\n44\n00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,910\nSo first we'll talk about\nthe desktop apps, and\n\n45\n00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,670\ngetting those installed on our system.\n\n46\n00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,370\n>> Absolutely.\n\n47\n00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,670\nAnd when we talk about desktop apps,\nthese are applications that we install.\n\n48\n00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,415\nCuz, you know, they used to be\ncalled applications not apps.\n\n49\n00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Until Steve Jobs came and\n\n50\n00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,970\nchanged everything.\n\n51\n00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,120\nBut, changed our terminology forever.\n\n52\n00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,030\nBut these desktop applications really\nhave been pretty much the same for\n\n53\n00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,880\na long, long time.\n\n54\n00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,970\nWhen you install an application under\nWindows 98, it was pretty much the same\n\n55\n00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,975\nprocess as installing an application\ntoday under Windows 7 and even Windows 8.\n\n56\n00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:06,100\nOur big difference is that Windows 8\nintroduced this new concept of the modern\n\n57\n00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,910\nUI or what was, for a short time,\nknown as the metro UI.\n\n58\n00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,300\nAnd those apps are a different world,\nso we'll tackle them separately.\n\n59\n00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,850\nBut for our traditional desktop\napps this is gonna be things like,\n\n60\n00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,730\nline of business applications,\ncustom applications, video games,\n\n61\n00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,470\nany software written, prior to 2012,\nwould be a standard desktop app.\n\n62\n00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,600\n>> Yep, now installing desktop apps.\n\n63\n00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,760\nSo we've got a couple\ndifferent ways to do it.\n\n64\n00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,100\nWell three different ways to be exact.\n\n65\n00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,440\nWe've got the traditional way\nof putting in your CD-ROM or\n\n66\n00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,730\nDVD, and installing it from there.\n\n67\n00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,270\nWe can install things over the network.\n\n68\n00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,080\nIt's pretty neat if you have\na domain environment set up,\n\n69\n00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,500\nthe domain controller can\npush out apps through.\n\n70\n00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,780\nHe can go into control panel and get apps,\n\n71\n00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,002\nand you can get things that are published\non there and download stuff.\n\n72\n00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:05,580\nAnd then apps can be\nrolled up into an image.\n\n73\n00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,085\nSo you can get Windows packaged\nwith all of your Office and\n\n74\n00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,105\nyour line of business stuff,\n\n75\n00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:16,395\nand push that out to computers and apps\nare already installed, part of the image.\n\n76\n00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:20,455\n>> So, let's talk a little\nbit about each one of these.\n\n77\n00:04:20,455 --> 00:04:24,832\nThe traditional install, what we think\nof as traditional, is the old CD-ROM.\n\n78\n00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,922\nAnd we talk about CDs like they're old,\n\n79\n00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:29,012\nbut traditional used\nto be the floppy disk.\n\n80\n00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,622\nRight, you go get your floppy disks.\n\n81\n00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:33,872\nIt used to be, and Nate,\nyou probably remember.\n\n82\n00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:37,551\nI used to love going to Best Buy or\nCompUSA or whatever,\n\n83\n00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:42,091\nand you'd walk in, and they have\neight rows of just computer software.\n\n84\n00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:45,011\nBox after box,\nthey used to come in the big boxes, and\n\n85\n00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:48,521\nyou'd walk around look at\nthe new productivity apps and\n\n86\n00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,517\nthe new video games and\nall that stuff you're just there.\n\n87\n00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:54,661\nAnd then usually would be like one or two\nMac isles and a bunch of Windows isles.\n\n88\n00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,000\nNow, have you been to the software\nsection of Best Buy lately?\n\n89\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,500\n>> No, not lately.\n\n90\n00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,897\n>> It's like one side of one row.\n\n91\n00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:05,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a small little section and\n\n92\n00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,235\nit's almost all TurboTax.\n\n93\n00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's like 20 different editions of\n\n94\n00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,690\nTurboTax and that's it,\ncuz people wanna do their taxes.\n\n95\n00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,600\nSo it's not the way that it used to be,\nthat going to the store and\n\n96\n00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,330\nbuying this actual, tangible copy of\nyour software that you then take home,\n\n97\n00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,720\npop a disc into your computer,\nand do your install.\n\n98\n00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,750\nIt really doesn't happen much anymore.\n\n99\n00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,840\nOperating systems, you still see sold\nlike that, Microsoft Windows, or some of\n\n100\n00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,400\nthe Linux distributions, Mac OS X, you can\ngo to the store and buy those on a disk\n\n101\n00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,914\nbut more commonly we see it delivered\nthough the other two methods now.\n\n102\n00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:42,730\n>> Good Deal.\n\n103\n00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,300\nWait, do you want to talk\nabout the other two, too?\n\n104\n00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,780\n>> Let's just make sure, you know, for\n\n105\n00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,660\npeople who haven't done this stuff before,\nthis is kind of new to them.\n\n106\n00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,420\nSo the second method It's really\ngaining in popularity now which is\n\n107\n00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,300\ninstalling over the network.\n\n108\n00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,630\nAnd it can be very complex,\nor it can be very simple, so\n\n109\n00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,920\nlet's look at the simple side first.\n\n110\n00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,914\nMaybe I need, somebody emails me\na zip file, so they zip something up,\n\n111\n00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:09,658\nit's archived, it's compressed,\nI need to be able to get at it.\n\n112\n00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:12,386\nAnd so I say,\nwell I need some software to do that.\n\n113\n00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:15,254\nI kinda like an application called, 7-Zip.\n\n114\n00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:18,070\nDo you use 7-Zip?\n\n115\n00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,870\n>> Yes, based on a recommendation,\nI just barely started using it.\n\n116\n00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,500\n>> Well, there we go.\n\n117\n00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,320\nSo, you see?\n\n118\n00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,565\nSometimes I recommend things.\n\n119\n00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:24,781\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And people listen.\n\n120\n00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:28,470\nSo, 7-Zip,\nit's an open source free archiver.\n\n121\n00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,650\nYou can go out and download,\nthe website's 7zip.org.\n\n122\n00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,790\nAnd, you go to that website, you click\ndownload, it downloads the software and\n\n123\n00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,150\nyou install it on your machine right there\nover the network, no mucking about with\n\n124\n00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,900\nCD's or floppy disks or USB keys,\nyou just download it and you install it.\n\n125\n00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,570\nFor home users, that is extremely common.\n\n126\n00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,390\nIf you wanna buy Microsoft Office,\nyou can go to Microsoft's website,\n\n127\n00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,330\nyou can download it right to your machine\nover the network, install it, and\n\n128\n00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:54,950\nyou've got Office.\n\n129\n00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,020\nAdobe, right?\n\n130\n00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,820\nThe Adobe Creative Cloud suite now,\nyou can buy all the Adobe products.\n\n131\n00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,250\nPhotoshop, and InDesign, and\n\n132\n00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,610\nall that downloads right off the internet,\ninstall on your machine, and off you go.\n\n133\n00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,210\nThat's the simple network\ninstall site methodology.\n\n134\n00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,350\nThe complex one is kind of\nwhat Nate was mentioning.\n\n135\n00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,600\nIn an enterprise or cooperate environment,\n\n136\n00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,260\nyou don't want your end users to be able\nto download and install install software.\n\n137\n00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,630\nSo we'll normally block that.\n\n138\n00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,310\nWe'll have it restricted.\n\n139\n00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,030\nAnd instead, the administrators of the\nnetwork will download the software they\n\n140\n00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,950\nwant people to have, and\nthey can do it called publishing it.\n\n141\n00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,030\nThey publish that software, and on any\ncomputer in the company, people can go\n\n142\n00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,782\ninto the control panel and do the little\nget apps option that Nate was mentioning.\n\n143\n00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:45,240\nAnd They'll see a list of all the approved\napplications from their administrators.\n\n144\n00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,149\nThey pick what they want and\nthey hit install, and\n\n145\n00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,793\nit installs right there over the network.\n\n146\n00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:52,857\nVery cool, very slick, so\nfor the Windows 8 exam, for\n\n147\n00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:56,500\nthis exam,\nyou need to be aware that is Possible.\n\n148\n00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,168\nThat is something that can be done.\n\n149\n00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:03,980\nFor those of you that continue on to\ndo the MCSA server infrastructure.\n\n150\n00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,035\nYou'll get that, right?\n\n151\n00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:08,511\nCuz that's all on the,\nthat's on the 7411 exam, isn't it?\n\n152\n00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,804\nYou don't know.\n\n153\n00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:11,498\nOh, you haven't-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:12,820\n>> You haven't done that exam.\n\n155\n00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,390\n>> No, no, no. [INAUDIBLE] >> So, okay.\n\n156\n00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,740\nI thought you had.\n\n157\n00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,330\n>> Not yet.\n\n158\n00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,490\nNot yet.\nOkay, all right.\n\n159\n00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,130\nSo anyhow,\nthat was on one of the server exams.\n\n160\n00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,260\nAnd you'll learn how to publish\nthose applications out.\n\n161\n00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,700\nSo it does require a server\ninfrastructure, so\n\n162\n00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,400\nit's not something you do at home.\n\n163\n00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,639\nWell, not a normal person at least.\n\n164\n00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,576\n>> Yep.\n\n165\n00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:31,765\nLast one,\nrolling up stuff in an image, right?\n\n166\n00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:34,427\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Installing Windows just kind of\n\n167\n00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:39,020\nthe regular way, with an image\nthat's this pre-prepared pack of\n\n168\n00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,876\nWindows Install with other stuff,\nlike apps and preloaded drivers.\n\n169\n00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,059\nRight?\nThat we talked about last time.\n\n170\n00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:51,030\nRoll it up into little Windows Install,\nand that can be installed different ways.\n\n171\n00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,850\nBut, yeah, everything will be\nrolled up and prepackaged,\n\n172\n00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,090\nand that pretty cut and dry.\n\n173\n00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,860\n>> And then, there's already some\napps rolled up that way, right?\n\n174\n00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,837\nWhen you install Windows8,\nyou've already got WordPad and Paint.\n\n175\n00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:05,766\nAnd do you get Freecell and stuff anymore?\n\n176\n00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:07,984\nIs that installed?\n\n177\n00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:10,170\nNo Freecell, but maybe Solitaire.\n\n178\n00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:14,545\nNo, you don't get any games by\ndefault anymore in Windows 8, do you?\n\n179\n00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:18,870\n>> [LAUGH] Because they're in the store.\n\n180\n00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,341\nThey're all free.\n>> Oh, you have to go there and get them.\n\n181\n00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:20,841\nOkay.\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n182\n00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,469\n>> So, you do get WordPad and\n\n183\n00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:26,227\nyou do get Microsoft Paint.\nSo you get some applications that are in\n\n184\n00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:28,737\nwithin windows when you install it.\nWell again,\n\n185\n00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:32,889\nyour network administrators in corporate\nenvironment, they can take the image and\n\n186\n00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,330\nthey can put even more apps in there.\nI know we have an image here\n\n187\n00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,390\nthat's already got Microsoft Office in it.\n\n188\n00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,265\nSo when we install Windows 8 to a machine,\n\n189\n00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:42,412\nMicrosoft Office is already there and\nrunning.\n\n190\n00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:45,410\nAnd, I think we do the Adobe Suite too,\nso it's there.\n\n191\n00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,650\nSo when we deploy that to a machine,\nit's already go that software, and\n\n192\n00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,840\nit's ready to rock.\n\n193\n00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,710\nAnd we use it.\n\n194\n00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,330\nAnd if you format the machine, and reload\nthe image, software's back again, so\n\n195\n00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,515\nyou don't have to deal with installing it.\n\n196\n00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:56,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n197\n00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,330\nYep.\n\n198\n00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,870\nAll right, so installing apps, right?\n\n199\n00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,280\nSo we got that.\n\n200\n00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,120\nNow,, any app that was made and\ncan install on Vista or Windows 7,\n\n201\n00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,550\nmost likely will install\njust fine on Windows 8.\n\n202\n00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,360\nOther times though,\nthings sometimes just don't work and\n\n203\n00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,410\nwe have compatibility issues.\n\n204\n00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,759\nWhich leads us into our\nfirst subobjective,\n\n205\n00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,660\nwhich is compatibility, right?\n\n206\n00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,210\nAnd Windows 8 and Windows 7, and\nI think Vista have this neat\n\n207\n00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,540\ncompatibility thing where you\ncan make stuff compatible.\n\n208\n00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,040\n>> Yeah, and if any of you\nguys have watched the Nate and\n\n209\n00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,350\nDon show that we do on the side.\n\n210\n00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,320\nYou know that we have a love\nof old video games, right?\n\n211\n00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,900\nSo, when your trying to run old software,\n\n212\n00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,240\nsoftware that was written in the 80s and\n90s and technologies like that.\n\n213\n00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,580\nIt doesn't run so well under Windows 8 and\nunder 64 bit OSs and stuff.\n\n214\n00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,360\nAnd so, there's a lot that we have\nto do to try and get it to work.\n\n215\n00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,240\nSome things are harder than others.\n\n216\n00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,980\nAnd Microsoft gives us a set of\ntools to be able to use for that.\n\n217\n00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,270\nNow, the changes over time, right?\n\n218\n00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,380\nNew features have been introduced in\nWindows, new security methods, and\n\n219\n00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,780\nthat's broken a lot of our older software.\n\n220\n00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,230\nBut a normal person would say,\nthat software is 20 years old.\n\n221\n00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,395\nWho cares, right?\nBut somebody like us,\n\n222\n00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,678\nyou got that nostalgia or\nwhatever, you have to have it.\n\n223\n00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:17,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, in terms of a video game,\n\n224\n00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900\nthat's not a big deal, right?\n\n225\n00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,460\n>> Well, it depends on the game.\n\n226\n00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,851\n>> That's a good point.\n[LAUGH] But out in the business world,\n\n227\n00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:31,464\nyou might have what's called a line\nof business application, or LOB.\n\n228\n00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:33,553\nThat's a term you'll see\nMicrosoft use on the exam.\n\n229\n00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:37,061\nA line of business application\nis a program that was written,\n\n230\n00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:41,660\nusually specifically for your company,\nthat performs some function, right?\n\n231\n00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,020\nSo you might be in a hospital, and\nthis application might be what\n\n232\n00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,950\ndesignates what dosage each patient is\nsupposed to get in the hospital, right?\n\n233\n00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,440\nReal important software.\n\n234\n00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,680\nReal expensive software.\n\n235\n00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,050\nAnd every time it gets upgraded,\nit's very expensive.\n\n236\n00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,600\nSo a lot of organizations,\nbanks, hospitals,\n\n237\n00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,050\nschools, they'll run software\nlike this that is dated.\n\n238\n00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,110\nAnd if they want to go to\na newer operating system,\n\n239\n00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,930\nthat software might not work.\n\n240\n00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,290\nSo Microsoft gives us some tools\nto make it where you can get that\n\n241\n00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,480\nsoftware to function.\n\n242\n00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,910\nAnd there's two advantages.\n\n243\n00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,650\nOne advantage is it lets us\nuse newer operating systems.\n\n244\n00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,240\n>> That's the advantage for us.\n\n245\n00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,670\nThe second advantage is it let's us spend\nmore money with Microsoft on a newer\n\n246\n00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,372\noperating system.\n\n247\n00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:25,211\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's the advantage for them.\n\n248\n00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,730\nSo- [LAUGH]\n>> Yep.\n\n249\n00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,030\nNow there's different ways of\nmaking an app compatible, right?\n\n250\n00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,380\nThere's App-V, right?\n\n251\n00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,498\nIt pushes stuff out.\n\n252\n00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:40,210\nAnd there's some real complicated, really\ncool things on how to push out apps,\n\n253\n00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,940\nand run in a virtualized space and\nall this fun stuff.\n\n254\n00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,630\nBut for this exam and for this,\n\n255\n00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,688\nwe're going to focus on the built-in tool,\nright?\n\n256\n00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:51,416\nCompatibility mode.\n\n257\n00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n258\n00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:56,910\n>> And compatibility mode,\nit's got a slew of different kind of\n\n259\n00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,770\ncompatible stuff that we're gonna\ntalk about and figure out each one.\n\n260\n00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,860\nAnd when and\nwhy you would use one of those.\n\n261\n00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n262\n00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,920\n>> Absolutely, so let's tackle it.\n\n263\n00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,350\nSo when we use compatibility mode,\nwe're using it cuz we\n\n264\n00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,150\nprobably have some kind of program, some\nsoftware that just isn't run in Windows 8.\n\n265\n00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,300\nRight?\nIt's broken, it's causing some issue.\n\n266\n00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,360\nAnd so, compatibility mode is a quick,\nsimple way to make software work.\n\n267\n00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440\nAnd Nate, do you have an example or\ndo you want me to whip one up?\n\n268\n00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,860\n>> Yeah, yeah, I can, I'll find one right-\n>> [LAUGH] So first of all,\n\n269\n00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,130\nhow do we know we need it, right?\n\n270\n00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,480\nBecause some software just works\nfine under Windows 8, right?\n\n271\n00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,620\nIt may be software that was\nwritten eight years ago, but\n\n272\n00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,040\nit might still run just fine.\n\n273\n00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,750\nSo, install software, right?\n\n274\n00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,000\nSet up a test machine,\ninstall the software, see what happens.\n\n275\n00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,580\nIf it runs, fine.\n\n276\n00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,660\nDon't worry about it,\ndon't worry about compatibility mode.\n\n277\n00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,502\nYou're good to go, just move right on.\n\n278\n00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:51,830\nOkay.\nBut if the software crashes out and\n\n279\n00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,510\ndoesn't work, well there's any number\nof reasons that can cause it, right?\n\n280\n00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,770\nOne thing is Microsoft moved\nsome files around in Windows 8.\n\n281\n00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,580\nThey actually did it in Windows 7 too.\n\n282\n00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,410\nSo some of the places your software\nmight be expecting a file to be,\n\n283\n00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,980\nmight not be there anymore.\n\n284\n00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,510\nWe also have user account control,\nI mean user access control.\n\n285\n00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,395\nNo, user account control.\n\n286\n00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:11,220\nI was right.\n\n287\n00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,880\nUAC.\n>> Yeah.\n\n288\n00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,480\n>> User account control?\n\n289\n00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,110\n>> Access control?\n\n290\n00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,840\n>> Is it access?\n\n291\n00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,190\nDad gummit.\n\n292\n00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,250\nSo now-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n293\n00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,050\n>> I've got myself doubting what\n\n294\n00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,930\nthe actual acronym is so\nlet me look that one up.\n\n295\n00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,830\nBut user account control, I was right\nthe first time, why do I doubt myself.\n\n296\n00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,390\n>> What did I say?\n\n297\n00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,310\nAccount?\n>> You said both.\n\n298\n00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,140\nI said both.\nI guess it doesn't really matter.\n\n299\n00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,410\nSo user account control.\n\n300\n00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,330\nThat was introduced in Windows Vista.\n\n301\n00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,910\nAnd it said that programs\nwhen they run will not run\n\n302\n00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,580\nwith administrative privileges by default.\n\n303\n00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,080\nThey'll just run as a regular user\nprogram, and that broke a lot of software.\n\n304\n00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,950\nA lot of software required that\nadministrative privilege, or\n\n305\n00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,880\nare wrote to directories that they're\nnot allowed to write to anymore.\n\n306\n00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,060\nAnd so, that's one of those things that\nwas added that might break our software.\n\n307\n00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,153\nAnd compatibility mode can help fix that.\n\n308\n00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:53,825\n>> Yeah.\n\n309\n00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:58,020\nUAC locking things down, right?\n\n310\n00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,780\nSo, windows has this resource protection\nwhere there are certain areas of\n\n311\n00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,610\nthe registry, certain areas of\nthe file directories that Windows\n\n312\n00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,740\nwill only let trusted installers\nright to those areas.\n\n313\n00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,140\nIt's read only for everything.\n\n314\n00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:19,252\nBut, if there's an old app that had\nto write to those directories or\n\n315\n00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,066\nmake a registry entry in this one area,\n\n316\n00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:26,850\nWindows locks it down to keep\nthings safe and that kind of stuff.\n\n317\n00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,870\nThis cool feature keeps computers\ncleaner and what not, but\n\n318\n00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,728\nalso does break some things.\n\n319\n00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,375\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you bring up a good point.\n\n320\n00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:42,917\nBack in Windows 95, Microsoft introduced\nthis idea of a folder, C:/programfiles.\n\n321\n00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:43,417\nRight?\n\n322\n00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,459\nThe program files folder,\nthat's where your programs install.\n\n323\n00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,944\nAnd for years that's where we\nwould install our software and\n\n324\n00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:52,420\nour software would write it's setting\nto there and all sorts of stuff.\n\n325\n00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,760\nStarting with Windows Vista,\nthey made it where programs can't write\n\n326\n00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,850\nto C:/programfiles anymore, and\nthat broke a lot of software.\n\n327\n00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,880\nA lot of software expected to be\nable to write files into their own\n\n328\n00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,390\ninstall directory.\n\n329\n00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,750\nAnd so\nif you have software that's like that,\n\n330\n00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,810\nthat has that requirement, well, you've\ngot to use compatibility mode to fix it.\n\n331\n00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,946\nSo it looks like you've got\nit pulled up over there Nate.\n\n332\n00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,380\n>> So here is the application,\nright, that we use.\n\n333\n00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,840\nYeah, it is a little on\nthe smaller side on here.\n\n334\n00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,110\n>> I can bring it up on mine.\n\n335\n00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,110\nI don't know if it'll be bigger or\nnot, but.\n\n336\n00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,220\n>> So, we've got this application\nthat we use to stream our\n\n337\n00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,370\nLaptops over to the video equipment.\n\n338\n00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,990\nOn this program, I've got\nthe compatibility properties pulled up.\n\n339\n00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,700\nHow's yours, Don?\n\n340\n00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,320\n>> It's a little bit bigger.\n\n341\n00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,600\n>> Well use yours, right.\n\n342\n00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,890\n>> Let me show them how I got here.\n\n343\n00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,150\nSo this is the program that I use,\nthis New Tech IVGA Pro.\n\n344\n00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,850\nThat's the software that lets\nyou guys see my screen, and\n\n345\n00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,760\nif it's causing me a problem, if it's not\nworking, you can right click on it, and\n\n346\n00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,130\nyou can choose Properties,\nand in the Properties for\n\n347\n00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,010\nthat program,\nyou'll see the general things, right?\n\n348\n00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,120\nLike, the name of the Shortcut and\nall that stuff, and\n\n349\n00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,030\nyou'll see this compatibility tab right\nhere and that's what we're talking about,\n\n350\n00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,260\nthis compatibility tab.\n\n351\n00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,540\n>> It does remind me of something Ian,\nhow Windows,\n\n352\n00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,500\nyou can't write your\nprogram files anymore.\n\n353\n00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,690\nSo programs are now writing to\na folder in your User profile.\n\n354\n00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,760\nWhich makes it really convenient to\nback up your program settings, right?\n\n355\n00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,514\nBecause it's all part\nof your user profile.\n\n356\n00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,065\n> That's convenient.\n\n357\n00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:39,570\n> And it is separated per user.\n\n358\n00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,605\nSo every user has their\nown instance of that.\n\n359\n00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:44,168\n> They're good features,\ndon't get us wrong.\n\n360\n00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,060\nIt's not > Finally Microsoft\nhas taken something away.\n\n361\n00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,810\nThey're making things better, but\n\n362\n00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,840\nthe software developers\nhave to keep up to speed.\n\n363\n00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,160\nThey have to keep updating their software.\n\n364\n00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,150\nAnd if you have software that's not\nupdated very often, like that video game\n\n365\n00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,196\nthat was written in 1989, then you're\ngoing to have some problems running it.\n\n366\n00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,900\nYup.\n\n367\n00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,950\n>> All right.\nLet's look at the compatibility mode in\n\n368\n00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,960\nthe different settings we have in there\nto fix that stuff in there, right?\n\n369\n00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,660\n>> Sure.\n>> You know we've got a run compatibility\n\n370\n00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,460\ntroubleshooter.\n\n371\n00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,110\nIt's this neat little wizard it\ngoes through, it walks through.\n\n372\n00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,550\nWe'll look at that last.\n\n373\n00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,540\n>> Last.\nOkay.\n\n374\n00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,740\n>> So now in our Compatibility mode.\n\n375\n00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,370\nSo under there, if we check that box and\ndrop that arrow down,\n\n376\n00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:32,280\nthere are some different operating\nsystems, Microsoft operating systems, and\n\n377\n00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,900\nthat will preconfigure some settings for\n\n378\n00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,245\nwhat we're trying to run the app under.\n\n379\n00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,945\n>> Yeah, basically,\nit's kind of like an emulator, in a way.\n\n380\n00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:47,535\nIf you choose one of these\nother operating systems,\n\n381\n00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:51,300\nthings like file level permissions,\nand disc access and stuff.\n\n382\n00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,940\nAre emulated to function the way that they\nused to function under these various OS's.\n\n383\n00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,750\nThings like writing to C:/ program files.\n\n384\n00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,460\nThat if I choose Windows 98 or Windows XP,\n\n385\n00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,860\nwhen I run that program, it will be\nallowed to write to those folders.\n\n386\n00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,860\nOr the Windows firewall that was\nintroduced in Windows XP, if I\n\n387\n00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,310\nchoose Windows XP service pack 2, when I\nrun that application it'll automatically\n\n388\n00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,620\nbe allowed through the firewall because\nthat's how it functioned back then.\n\n389\n00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,720\nSo it kind of rolls back some of\nthe function out of the operating system.\n\n390\n00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,850\nNow the nice thing is that it does\njust affect this one application.\n\n391\n00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,130\nSo all of your other applications still\nrun in the normal Windows 8 modes.\n\n392\n00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,680\nThese individual applications\nhere will start to run.\n\n393\n00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,530\nIt will think they're running under\nthese older operating systems.\n\n394\n00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,560\nThat's one that I bumped\ninto all the time.\n\n395\n00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,560\nI might have an application that I know\nworks just fine under Windows 8, but when\n\n396\n00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,960\nyou run it in the installer, the developer\nset it to check the operating system.\n\n397\n00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,610\nIf it wasn't Windows 7,\nto stop the install.\n\n398\n00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,480\nThis is an unsupported OS.\n\n399\n00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160\nBut you know it'll run just fine so\nyou can go into the compatibility mode and\n\n400\n00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,780\ntell it Window 7 and\nnow when you run the installer\n\n401\n00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,710\nit'll think that it's on Window 7,\nit'll install and off you go.\n\n402\n00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,720\nYou can run your application.\n\n403\n00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,160\n>> Good deal and thanks Don for that.\n\n404\n00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,430\nReduce color mode.\n\n405\n00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,020\nRight?\n\n406\n00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,640\nSo reduce color mode, right, I know what\nit does, right, it reduces the color mode,\n\n407\n00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,810\nby default we're at 32 bit color,\nmillions of colors.\n\n408\n00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,410\nWe have a 16 bit color, and 8 bit color.\n\n409\n00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:30,330\nI know what it does, but\nnot, when would you use it?\n\n410\n00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,470\nWhen would this mode fix something?\n\n411\n00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,560\n>> It's funny you mention it,\nbecause I've never had to use it.\n\n412\n00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,990\nThere are some application that you run,\nand I know I had one.\n\n413\n00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,450\nI'm trying to remember what it was.\n\n414\n00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,650\nBut there are some applications that\ncan not operate in 32 bit color mode.\n\n415\n00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,920\nAnd so if you run them,\nthey'll throw an error,\n\n416\n00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,320\nsaying you need to lower your color modes.\n\n417\n00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,230\nAnd I know an application that I've got,\n\n418\n00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,000\nI just can't remember\nthe name of it off hand.\n\n419\n00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,670\nI'll have to try and hunt it down.\n\n420\n00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,000\nBut, if an application\ncomplains about that and\n\n421\n00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,870\nsays the color depth is set too high or\nyou get some memory errors.\n\n422\n00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,030\nThen you can try reducing\nthat color depth,\n\n423\n00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,130\nand what it's really doing,\nis reducing the amount of\n\n424\n00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,130\nvideo card memory that's being\nrepresented to the application.\n\n425\n00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,150\nOn some of these modern network cards,\nyou can have tons of memory on them.\n\n426\n00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,240\nWay more than what a 32 bit or\n16 bit application can recognize.\n\n427\n00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,470\nAnd so this helps us to reduce that and\n\n428\n00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,520\nput it into numbers that that application\nis a little more comfortable with.\n\n429\n00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360\n>> Nice.\n\n430\n00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,720\nThe next one, the 640 by 480 mode,\n\n431\n00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,000\nnow when I was looking at that one\nit did call out specific dos based\n\n432\n00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,380\nPrograms that were written for\n640 by 40 screen resolution.\n\n433\n00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,230\nJimmy that's pretty small, right.\n\n434\n00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,825\nMy phone has a higher\nresolution then that.\n\n435\n00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,540\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's true, but\n\n436\n00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,410\nit is exactly like you said if you are\nrunning an old dos based application 640\n\n437\n00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,310\nby 480 was a very popular\nresolution from like 1985 to 1990.\n\n438\n00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,970\n1990 is where we started seeing\nthat big jump to 800 by 600.\n\n439\n00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,270\nSo there were a ton of the old DOS based,\nand\n\n440\n00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,480\nI'm not talking about like Windows 3.1.\n\n441\n00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,390\nI'm talking about running it from\nthe DOS command shell type applications.\n\n442\n00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,310\nAnd so if you run them on a higher\nresolution, it doesn't do them any favors.\n\n443\n00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,650\nThe other thing is,\na lot of monitors are now 16:9.\n\n444\n00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:26,020\nSo they are these widescreen monitors and\nthese dos apps are expecting\n\n445\n00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,900\na 4:3 screen, so they are expecting\nthat different aspect ratio.\n\n446\n00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,000\nSo by hard setting this, it can again,\n\n447\n00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,090\njust help ensure that application\nis rendered properly on the screen.\n\n448\n00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:41,120\nNow, this was a really useful\nsetting under Window 7 and earlier.\n\n449\n00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,680\nBut now that they've killed off\nthe 16-bit support in Windows 8, right?\n\n450\n00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,780\nYou have no 16-bit app support.\n\n451\n00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,805\nThat really killed off the need for this,\nbecause any application that was written\n\n452\n00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:55,777\nthat required that resolution is typically\ngoing to be a 16-bit application.\n\n453\n00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:57,050\n>> Nice.\n\n454\n00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,340\nAll right, the next one, right?\n\n455\n00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,050\nDisable display scaling\non high DPI settings.\n\n456\n00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,920\nDPIs are dots per inch, right?\n\n457\n00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:13,660\nAnd some of our screens these days can\nhave a real dense Pixel density and\n\n458\n00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,810\nin some aspects perhaps it can break it.\n\n459\n00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:23,890\nThere's let's say for\nexample you pull up an application and\n\n460\n00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,030\nthe letters are real squished together or\nmaybe they are,\n\n461\n00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:33,200\npartially overlapping and\nit's this display scaling kind of thing.\n\n462\n00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,510\nAnd check this box,\nI haven't tested it out on somebody.\n\n463\n00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,050\n>> Oh no I have.\n\n464\n00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,700\nI've had to use this one.\n\n465\n00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,292\n>> Oh yeah?\n>> Yep.\n\n466\n00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,167\nI've got a real world experience for\nthis one.\n\n467\n00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:45,125\nSo I use a program, actually it\nhappens in a couple of Programs.\n\n468\n00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,650\nIf you find that you use\nremote desktop a lot,\n\n469\n00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,010\nif you're remoting into a lot of machines,\nright?\n\n470\n00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,630\nThe built in remote desktop client,\nthis guy will let you connect to\n\n471\n00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,940\none remote system, so\nyou can see one remote system screen.\n\n472\n00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,450\nBut I'll frequently be remoted into\nfour or five machines at the same time.\n\n473\n00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,650\nSo I have a couple of programs that\nI use that allow me to do that.\n\n474\n00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:11,250\nAnd one of my favorites is\na program called RD Tabs and\n\n475\n00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,740\nI don't have it installed on my studio\nlaptop but let me just show it to you so\n\n476\n00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,880\nyou can see what I'm talking about.\n\n477\n00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,640\nOh here, I can show them deploying\nan application via the network.\n\n478\n00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,590\nI'm going right out to\nthe vendor's website.\n\n479\n00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,000\nAvian Waves is the company that\nmakes it and I'm downloading it.\n\n480\n00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,940\nSo I don't have a CD or anything and I'm\njust going to run the little setup here.\n\n481\n00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,970\nSee it all ties back full circle right?\n\n482\n00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,410\nAw I need the .NET framework?\n\n483\n00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,370\nThat's going to take 20 minutes.\n\n484\n00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,700\nWell maybe after the break I'll show it,\none of the things is if your monitor is\n\n485\n00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:54,340\nset to 1920 by 1080, high resolution,\nthe text gets really small.\n\n486\n00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,990\nSo you can use DPI scaling to go in and\nincrease your text size.\n\n487\n00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,300\nWell, the problem I have in rd tabs,\nand in some other remote desktops too,\n\n488\n00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,610\nnot just this one, is it bumps up the text\nsize, and it launches this nice screen and\n\n489\n00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,160\nI get my little tabs where I can\nflip between virtual machines but\n\n490\n00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,060\nthen the desktops that are rendered.\n\n491\n00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,810\nAre rendered really low resolution cause\nthe DPI's ceiling affects them also.\n\n492\n00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,050\nAnd so it makes it where all the remote\ndesktops that I pull up are 640 by 480 or\n\n493\n00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,770\nsome ridiculous low resolution.\n\n494\n00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,610\nI can't see everything on the screen.\n\n495\n00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,120\nSo when I run RD tabs.\n\n496\n00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,340\nI disabled DPI scaling just for that app.\n\n497\n00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,320\nI leave it on for Internet Explorer and\nMicrosoft Word and\n\n498\n00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,400\nall those programs that benefit from it,\nbut\n\n499\n00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,869\nfor this one application, I need to\ndisable it, and so I use that option.\n\n500\n00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,600\nThe RD Tab software is great.\n\n501\n00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200\nIt works fine under Windows 8.\n\n502\n00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,880\nIf you're doing DPI scaling,\nit does interfere with it.\n\n503\n00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,310\nYou just choose that option and now it'll\nrender nice and in the full resolution.\n\n504\n00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,480\nText will be small but\nthe desktop will look great.\n\n505\n00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,990\n>> Right on.\n\n506\n00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,580\nThanks Tom.\n\n507\n00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,440\nSo the last option we have down there,\nrun program as administrator.\n\n508\n00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:13,840\nAll right, some apps do need rights to\njust run about on your system, right?\n\n509\n00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,095\nAnd right there, so there we go.\n\n510\n00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:20,665\nSo now, we can right click on executables\nand choose run as administrator.\n\n511\n00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:23,785\nWe can check this box down here and\nthen, we can just double click on it.\n\n512\n00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:26,265\n>> And this was the one option\nthat if I pull it back up,\n\n513\n00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,300\nI just cancelled out, there we go.\n\n514\n00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,880\nYou'll notice I already had that set,\nokay?\n\n515\n00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,720\nAnd that's because I know that\nthe IVGA software that I use.\n\n516\n00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,760\nThe software that lets\nyou guys see my screen.\n\n517\n00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,670\nIt has to run as an administrator, because\nit taps into the video card driver, right?\n\n518\n00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,940\nSo I know that.\n\n519\n00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,620\nEvery time I run it,\nit's going to be run as an administrator.\n\n520\n00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,740\nSo instead of having to right click\non it every day, and choose run as\n\n521\n00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,150\nadministrator, I used compatibility mode\nand I checked that option off already.\n\n522\n00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,710\nSo that every time I run it,\nit knows to run it as an administrator.\n\n523\n00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,060\nSo that, I have an active use.\n\n524\n00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,880\n>> Nice.\nYou know, Don,\n\n525\n00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,450\nwe've got just a couple of minutes left,\n\n526\n00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,360\nbut let's run that compatibility\ntrouble shooter up there.\n\n527\n00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,790\nLet's run through that.\n\n528\n00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,620\nNow, I've used this a couple\nof times in real life.\n\n529\n00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,460\nI have yet to have it like fix-\n>> Work?\n\n530\n00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,400\n>> Give you a real solution of things\nthat have to go and repair myself.\n\n531\n00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,130\nAll right.\n\n532\n00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,720\nSo there are recommended settings.\n\n533\n00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,780\nIt will go through and\nand apply Settings and\n\n534\n00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,960\ntry to run the app, and\nthen, yeah, fix it that way.\n\n535\n00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,344\nRight?\nTroubleshoot the program, right/ Yeah,\n\n536\n00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:36,980\nlet's-\n>> Now, like you,\n\n537\n00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,370\nI've had about the same experience, that\nwhen you do the Try Recommended Settings,\n\n538\n00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,250\nit does make some changes,\nbut it never quite gets it.\n\n539\n00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,440\nThe second option, the troubleshooter\nprogram, this is a little bit better,\n\n540\n00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,500\nbecause you can start to\ntell it what the problem is.\n\n541\n00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,180\nSo you can start to say like, hey, this\nversion working in an earlier version of\n\n542\n00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,060\nWindows, or this program opens but\nthe display is messed up.\n\n543\n00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:01,380\nThat starts to give Microsoft a better\nidea of what it needs to fix this program.\n\n544\n00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,190\n>> Now if I'm not mistaken in the end,\nit's still just going to check off those\n\n545\n00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,770\nlittle checkboxes and\ncompatibility mode, correct?\n\n546\n00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,240\n>> Yes, it's just trying to take the\ncomplexity of knowing what the options are\n\n547\n00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,850\n>> Away, right?\n\n548\n00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,190\n>> Yeah.\n>> Sweet.\n\n549\n00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,870\nAlright, yeah.\n\n550\n00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,596\nGood deal, there we go.\n\n551\n00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:19,090\n>> So I'm kind of hesitant to finish\nthe wizard though because it's my IBGA so\n\n552\n00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,010\nif I run it it'll probably\nclose my terminal.\n\n553\n00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,480\nMy remote session.\n\n554\n00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,140\nBut basically it is supposed to make it\na little easier on you if you don't know\n\n555\n00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,140\nwhat all these different terms\nare that it'll try it out for you.\n\n556\n00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,640\n>> Nice.\n\n557\n00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,780\n>> All right.\nWell Nate we are right up\n\n558\n00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,520\non our break time.\n\n559\n00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,750\nSo, you got anything else to throw in,\nin our last couple of seconds?\n\n560\n00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,810\n>> No I'm good for now.\n\n561\n00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,610\n>> Sweet.\n\n562\n00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,470\nAll right well ladies and\ngentlemen stay tuned.\n\n563\n00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,150\nWhen we get back we've got a little\nmore installing to do, right?\n\n564\n00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,730\n>> I think it was.\n\n565\n00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,260\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n566\n00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,910\n>> So.\n\n567\n00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,280\n>> Shims and stuff.\n\n568\n00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,000\n>> Sweet.\n\n569\n00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,045\nGot to see program shims.\n\n570\n00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:53,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, all stuff is on the exam.\n\n571\n00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,477\nSo, all right ladies and gentleman\nstay tuned and we'll be back in a few.\n\n572\n00:28:56,477 --> 00:29:04,440\n[MUSIC]\n\n573\n00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,370\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n574\n00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,390\nSo before the break we took a look\nat installing some applications and\n\n575\n00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,650\ncompatibility mode stuff and\n\n576\n00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,410\nwe looked at some of the basic\ncompatibility mode things.\n\n577\n00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,850\nThe easy to do stuff.\n\n578\n00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,930\nIf it's a one-time application\nthat's giving us grief and\n\n579\n00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,970\nwe just need to try and get it to work.\n\n580\n00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,500\nBut, what if it's a line\nof business application,\n\n581\n00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,370\nwhat if it's an important one.\n\n582\n00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,500\nAnd we need to install\nit on 1,000 machines.\n\n583\n00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,770\nWell, you don't want to have\nto go to 1,000 machines,\n\n584\n00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,380\nand right click on them and choose\nproperties and go through that whole mess.\n\n585\n00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,620\nSo we've got some stuff that's in place\nof windows that can help facilitate that.\n\n586\n00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,110\nAnd Nate do you want to tackle this one?\n\n587\n00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,960\n>> Yeah, sure.\nSo all right so,\n\n588\n00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,580\nWindows has this,\nI guess a suite of tools, called\n\n589\n00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,740\nthe application compatibility tool kit,\nthat's what you're referring to right?\n\n590\n00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,180\n>> Yes Stace,\nmake sure we're at the same wavelength.\n\n591\n00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:00,790\n>> All right so what this thing does\nit creates these little programs.\n\n592\n00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:06,230\nI guess you'd call it, they're call shins\nand it's like the little program or what\n\n593\n00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:12,000\nnot that attaches itself to the executable\nof whatever you're trying to repair.\n\n594\n00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,870\nAnd then you can push that out and\nit fixes thing.\n\n595\n00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,350\nNow, I guess in real basic simple terms.\n\n596\n00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,170\n>> It fixes stuff.\n\n597\n00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:28,000\n>> There are a lot of settings, we're\ngoing to run through a real basic example\n\n598\n00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,290\nof it on an example, but\nit's a pretty powerful tool.\n\n599\n00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,780\n>> Now it's designed for\ncorporate and enterprise users.\n\n600\n00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,800\nPeople who are going to be installing\nan application over and over again and\n\n601\n00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,180\nalready want to have their\nfixes prepackaged in.\n\n602\n00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,470\nAs a result, it's not installed\nwith Windows by default.\n\n603\n00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,710\nYou have to go to Microsoft's website and\ndownload it.\n\n604\n00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,730\nThat is true isn't it?\n\n605\n00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,230\n>> Yes correct\n>> That's how I've always got it so.\n\n606\n00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,210\n>> You go to Microsoft's website and\nyou do a search for\n\n607\n00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,800\napplication compatibility toolkit,\nyou'll find it on there.\n\n608\n00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,500\nIt's free, they don't charge anything for\n\n609\n00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,580\nit, they just know that 99% of\nthe people out there don't need it.\n\n610\n00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,600\nSo they don't put it inside of Windows.\n\n611\n00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,260\nGo to Microsoft's website,\nyou download it,\n\n612\n00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,719\nit will have all the utilities\nthat Nate is about to show us.\n\n613\n00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,660\n>> You want to do it right now?\n\n614\n00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,052\n>> Absolutely,\nlet's get some software running.\n\n615\n00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:19,630\n>> All right,\nwe got sky cam ready for this?\n\n616\n00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,785\nI am just kidding\n>> Our second producer,\n\n617\n00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,660\nwhat title does Jason have?\n\n618\n00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,310\n>> Director.\n\n619\n00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,560\n>> We promised him we weren't\ngoing to use the skycam today so\n\n620\n00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,860\nwe just look frantically\naround [INAUDIBLE].\n\n621\n00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,500\n>> All right.\n\n622\n00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,708\nSweet.\n\n623\n00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:40,118\nAll right I've gone out before the show\nto save a little bit of time and\n\n624\n00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:42,792\ndownloaded the compatibility tool kit.\n\n625\n00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:43,375\nRight?\n\n626\n00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,125\nAnd now Don, I was gonna point this out.\n\n627\n00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:52,250\nRemember in our last episode about those\nWindows store driver companion apps?\n\n628\n00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:52,990\n>> You got one.\n\n629\n00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,830\n>> Yeah, it's appeared.\n\n630\n00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,810\nI didn't install it.\n\n631\n00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,434\nIt's this Hewlett Packard laser thing.\n\n632\n00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:02,039\n[INAUDIBLE] and\nI'd installed nothing, and one day,\n\n633\n00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,340\nI think it was after the show, I'd shut\neverything down and it just appeared.\n\n634\n00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,680\n>> It found it.\n\n635\n00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,050\nIt's cool.\n\n636\n00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,920\nSort of cool.\n\n637\n00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,100\nIt is a little bit cluttered.\n\n638\n00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,900\nNow you've got this active tile,\nTim's laser printer.\n\n639\n00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n640\n00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,830\nI tried clicking on it.\n\n641\n00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,310\nI can order replacement cartridges for\nhim.\n\n642\n00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,980\n>> Well, sweet.\n\n643\n00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,750\nHe'd love that.\n\n644\n00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,360\n>> Or replacement toner.\n\n645\n00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,980\nAll right.\n\n646\n00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,270\nSo on the compatibility toolkit,\nright, so we've got a,\n\n647\n00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,040\nyeah, it comes with all these, one,\ntwo, three, four, five, six, right?\n\n648\n00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,800\nThese six,\nI'm not sure what stock viewer's from, but\n\n649\n00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,380\nthese six little programs\nthat will fix things.\n\n650\n00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,690\nThe one that we're going to focus on,\nis that one right there right.\n\n651\n00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,520\nThe compatibility administrator and\nthe 32 bit, right?\n\n652\n00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,060\nSo there's a 32 bit and a 64 bit one,\nand depending on the application you\n\n653\n00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,680\nwant to fix, you have to pick\nthe right tool fixer thing.\n\n654\n00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,830\nSo we're going to use the 32 bit right?\n\n655\n00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,816\nAnd the guy opens up ,all right,\n\n656\n00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:10,160\nnow we've got, so it just creates, sorry.\n\n657\n00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,270\nThis like database stuff.\n\n658\n00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,980\nNow, for\nour real basic use example of this guy.\n\n659\n00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,560\nThis little fix right here.\n\n660\n00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,460\nNow, it's going to\nautomatically do some things.\n\n661\n00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,580\nRight, starting off we're just gonna name\nit now program that we're going to fix.\n\n662\n00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,520\nAll right ski free, right, Don when\nwas the last time you played ski free?\n\n663\n00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,930\n>> I would have played Ski Free for\nthe last time probably in 1995,\n\n664\n00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,060\nmaybe would be the latest\nthat I played it.\n\n665\n00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,620\nFor those of you that have\nbeen computers a while,\n\n666\n00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,730\nyou probably remember it was a little\nskiing game with Windows 3.1.\n\n667\n00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,000\nThe first time I played\nit would have been,\n\n668\n00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,940\nprobably would have been 1990s\nsomewhere around in there.\n\n669\n00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,950\nBut it's an old game.\n\n670\n00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,790\nSo I'm surprised if it will work for\nWindows 8.\n\n671\n00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,060\n>> Well I've got great news for you Don.\n\n672\n00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,330\nA solution is named?\n\n673\n00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,950\nYeah, we are about to repair\nit to work on Windows 8.\n\n674\n00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,283\n>> Amazing.\n[LAUGH]\n\n675\n00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:03,110\n>> All right, so we, right,\n\n676\n00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,450\nname of the program that\nwe're going to fix, right,\n\n677\n00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,200\nand we'll just browse to our location,\nright?\n\n678\n00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,930\nSo we've got a little\nexecutable right there.\n\n679\n00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:14,140\nWe open this guy up, move along forward.\n\n680\n00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:19,230\nNow there are a slew of\nlittle fixes on how to\n\n681\n00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,950\nreally narrow down what\nthis thing is gonna fix.\n\n682\n00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:26,830\nAnd like Don said before, it's mainly\ngeared toward line of business apps.\n\n683\n00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,940\nRight he's like,\ncustom built applications for\n\n684\n00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,070\ncertain functions, and\nwho knows what those things do.\n\n685\n00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:38,060\nAnd so this has a lot of different things\nto try to narrow it down and fix it.\n\n686\n00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,310\nWhat we are going to do though.\n\n687\n00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:44,380\nIs choose this little box up here and this\nwill, sort of like the compatibility mode,\n\n688\n00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,384\nit will pre-select stuff based on what OS,\n\n689\n00:34:49,384 --> 00:34:52,780\nso what we're gonna do pick 95.\n\n690\n00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:57,550\nGo through and then now here are some of\nthe things that it has pre-selected to\n\n691\n00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,185\nfix and you know, there's a slew of other\nones that we can try to figure out an\n\n692\n00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n693\n00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,650\n>> An, and fix other things.\n\n694\n00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,530\nSo we'll go through next and\nthere's, you know, more stuff but\n\n695\n00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,360\nwe're just going to click\nthrough it except the defaults.\n\n696\n00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,810\nAnd there it goes, right?\n\n697\n00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,450\nSo it's now created this little file.\n\n698\n00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,890\nActually, not yet, sorry.\n\n699\n00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:21,540\nWe have to save it, save our changes,\nand we're gonna call it ski free.\n\n700\n00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,050\nAnd we're gonna save it in\nthe ski free directory.\n\n701\n00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:33,320\n[LAUGH] I thought it was Don.\n\n702\n00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,160\nAll right.\n\n703\n00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,640\nNow it's created a little file, right?\n\n704\n00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,050\nSo we're going to browse, into.\n\n705\n00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,920\n>> And\nthat little file that Nate just made,\n\n706\n00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,280\nthat's the shim that\nwe were talking about.\n\n707\n00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,540\nSo this shim file is designed to be,\nit contains the fixes needed for\n\n708\n00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,570\nthe program to run,\ncombined with the program itself,\n\n709\n00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,935\nyou now have a compatible set of software.\n\n710\n00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,720\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n711\n00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,520\nAll right, so, there's a little file,\nright skifree.sdd that's our little shim.\n\n712\n00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,230\nNow to apply it, to open up an\nadministrative command prompt, all right.\n\n713\n00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,005\nSo we just need to simply\nbrowse to our directory.\n\n714\n00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:24,415\nIs that the original Tron?\n\n715\n00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:24,935\n>> What?\n\n716\n00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:27,525\nYeah, that was going to\nbe another example, but\n\n717\n00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:29,435\nnow you've just kind of\nruined the surprise.\n\n718\n00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:32,105\n>> I saw the folder,\nwhat was I supposed to do, ignore it?\n\n719\n00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:32,678\nIt's Tron.\n\n720\n00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:36,050\n[LAUGH]\n>> We can play it.\n\n721\n00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:36,590\n>> We'll see.\n\n722\n00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,270\n>> We'll play it later.\n\n723\n00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:44,390\nSo now the command sdbinst ,which\nwill call up the little program.\n\n724\n00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,830\nAnd then we can take a look\nat some of the switches.\n\n725\n00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:54,100\nThere aren't many in there.\n\n726\n00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,249\nSo sdbinst.\n\n727\n00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,276\nAnd then our game, right?\n\n728\n00:36:58,276 --> 00:37:00,005\nSki.\n\n729\n00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:08,671\nClasses, skifree.sde.\n\n730\n00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:16,075\nAll right, so now what's it's done\nis it's taken this little shin and\n\n731\n00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:17,425\nthrown it into our EXE.\n\n732\n00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:21,385\nAnd you know what, I didn't try\nthe EXE first to show it not working,\n\n733\n00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:24,060\nbut we have now just fixed it.\n\n734\n00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,860\n>> So\nif you're an Enterprise Administrator, and\n\n735\n00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,970\nyou need to install this\nsoftware on a thousand machines.\n\n736\n00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,640\nYou could script it so\nthat, on the machine,\n\n737\n00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,450\nit ran as db and\nskifree.sdb would install that.\n\n738\n00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,460\nAnd it would be ready until you\ncould have all those thousands of\n\n739\n00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,590\nmachines up and going.\n\n740\n00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,690\nWithout having to\nright-click on their icon,\n\n741\n00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,080\nand choose properties and stuff like that.\n\n742\n00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,880\nAll right?\n\n743\n00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,590\n>> And\nthen just to try the whole thing out,\n\n744\n00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,300\nwe'll just click on our little file there.\n\n745\n00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,880\nWe will run it.\n\n746\n00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,100\nAnd there we go.\n\n747\n00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,100\n>> And let's see how far we get before\nthe, should I ruin the surprise for\n\n748\n00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,410\neverybody, that you know\n>> So you ski for a while, and\n\n749\n00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,240\nwhen you get far enough down the mountain,\nthe abominable snowman comes and eats you.\n\n750\n00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,430\nAnd so there's no way to beat this game,\nand yet it was wildly popular for\n\n751\n00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,590\na long time.\n\n752\n00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,190\n>> How often did you play it, Don?\n\n753\n00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,010\n>> Entirely too much.\n\n754\n00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:20,008\nThis was probably responsibly for at least\na letter grade, when I was in high school.\n\n755\n00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,220\n>> So [LAUGH]\n>> That many?\n\n756\n00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,960\n>> Maybe.\n\n757\n00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,530\nMaybe.\n\n758\n00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,070\nYeah.\n\n759\n00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,000\nSo anyhow, good old Ski Free.\n\n760\n00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,500\nSo old software isn't necessarily dead,\n\n761\n00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,300\nif you still need it you can utilize\nthings like the shim database,\n\n762\n00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,480\nthe application capability tool kit,\nto get it up and going.\n\n763\n00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,050\nYou're actually doing really well for\nnot actually playing.\n\n764\n00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:44,110\n>> I was going to host this file so\nthat other guys,\n\n765\n00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,990\nwe could all as a group,\nwe can get together.\n\n766\n00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,721\n>> We can have a competition\nvia IT Pro TV Ski Free contest.\n\n767\n00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,390\n>> I'd probably win.\n\n768\n00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,700\nSweet, there we go.\n\n769\n00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,590\nThere's our shim,\nI like to say there we go.\n\n770\n00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,440\nThere's our shimcore.\n\n771\n00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,730\nAnd it takes a while longer for\nthat snow guy to come out.\n\n772\n00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,180\n>> Yeah, he had to be much more superior.\n\n773\n00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,750\n>> Yep.\n\n774\n00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,300\n>> All right, so that's a pretty good one.\n\n775\n00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,680\nI don't have anything else to add on\nthe application compatibility tool,\n\n776\n00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,550\nI can't even say the dang gone thing.\n\n777\n00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,190\n>> Yep.\n\n778\n00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,260\nThere's a whole slew of options and\n\n779\n00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,680\nthings to really narrow it\ndown to a specific app.\n\n780\n00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,870\nYou're looking to repair, of course\nwe used it to accept all defaults,\n\n781\n00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,760\nreal basic example of it.\n\n782\n00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,292\n>> But it worked.\n\n783\n00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:29,917\n>> Yeah, it worked.\n\n784\n00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:33,183\nSo that's all I got for [INAUDIBLE]\n>> So\n\n785\n00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:37,083\nlet's go back to Back to the world\nof modern applications right.\n\n786\n00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,860\nApplications that\nare actually supported and\n\n787\n00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,070\nwritten by developers\nthat are still alive.\n\n788\n00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,210\nAnd so\nassuming your developers are still alive.\n\n789\n00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,560\nThen they will up date their\nsoftware to reflect modern systems.\n\n790\n00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,440\nAnd so\nyou can keep deploying that software.\n\n791\n00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,410\nAnd you don't have to mess around with\nthings like the compatibility wizard.\n\n792\n00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,290\nSo we talked about earlier\ninstalling an app.\n\n793\n00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,700\nAnd how you can just run its\nsetup file and get it installed.\n\n794\n00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,260\nBut we're gonna take a look at\na few other ways to install things,\n\n795\n00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,520\nparticularly using the Windows Installer.\n\n796\n00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,429\nNow the Windows Installer is a subsystem\nthat's been a part of Windows,\n\n797\n00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,270\nI don't know,\nwhen did they introduce that?\n\n798\n00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:20,380\nIn like, Windows 2000 I think,\nit's been in there for a long time.\n\n799\n00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,260\nAnd basically it's a set of\nsoftware that's built into Windows\n\n800\n00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,670\nthat manages the installation\nof your program.\n\n801\n00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,390\nSo it controls actually getting\nthose files to the right place.\n\n802\n00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,590\nAnd it can even influence uninstalling\nthe files to get them out.\n\n803\n00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,210\nSo it used to be that if\nyou installed software,\n\n804\n00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,820\nevery software package you installed\nwould have its own uninstaller.\n\n805\n00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,420\nNow they don't.\n\n806\n00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,040\nNow they just rely on the Windows\nInstaller to take care of that.\n\n807\n00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,300\nSo much more streamlined system.\n\n808\n00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,750\nAnd as an administrator,\n\n809\n00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,230\nwe can take advantage of that\nto quickly deploy applications.\n\n810\n00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,590\n>> You know Don, I just thought of\nsomething about compatibility stuff.\n\n811\n00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,810\nSo all of our compatibility fixes and\neverything.\n\n812\n00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,570\nMy favorite way to fix applications.\n\n813\n00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,390\nCan you guess?\n\n814\n00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,050\n>> I think I can.\n\n815\n00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,980\n>> A virtual machine.\n\n816\n00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,020\nNow, I've just been using these virtual\nmachines for a little while now.\n\n817\n00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,990\nWe're gonna cover it a bit,\nlittle bit later in a series of shows.\n\n818\n00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,010\nBut yeah a virtual machine.\n\n819\n00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,360\nNot one way to fix stuff.\n\n820\n00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,020\n>> Yeah, we're running Windows 8,\n64-bit edition.\n\n821\n00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,840\nAnd in Windows 8 they got rid\nof the old 16-bit subsystem.\n\n822\n00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,448\nSo if you have a 16-bit application,\nit doesn't matter how hard you throw that\n\n823\n00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,835\napplication compatibility toolkit at it,\nyou're not gonna get it to run.\n\n824\n00:41:35,835 --> 00:41:38,400\n16-bit apps will not run on Windows 8.\n\n825\n00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,470\nIf you want to run them though,\n\n826\n00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,130\nyou can bring up a virtual machine\nthrow Windows XP in there or\n\n827\n00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,490\nWindows 95 or whatever,\nyour 16-bit apps will run just fine.\n\n828\n00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,120\nSo virtual machines do give you that\nbest of both worlds for compatibility.\n\n829\n00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,760\n>> That's right.\nI didn't mean to\n\n830\n00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,430\nback pedal on you-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n831\n00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,230\n>> I just thought I'd throw it out there.\n\n832\n00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,228\n>> [LAUGH] It's a good point.\n\n833\n00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:03,540\n>> Windows installer stuff.\n\n834\n00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,690\n>> So you want to tackle the MSIs?\n\n835\n00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:13,340\n>> Yeah, so we've got this MSI\nextension and we have an EXE extension.\n\n836\n00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,320\nThere are some installers that have EXE,\nextension, some installers have MSI.\n\n837\n00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,290\n>> Let me pull back up, remember,\n\n838\n00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,770\nbefore the break I was gonna download\nRD Tabs which I never did do.\n\n839\n00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,620\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n840\n00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,070\n>> But let me pull this\nback up on the screen here.\n\n841\n00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:32,225\nSo when I went to the RD Tabs\nwebsite to download this software.\n\n842\n00:42:32,225 --> 00:42:37,255\nI went to download it and\nnotice how they've got a 32-bit x86 and\n\n843\n00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:40,105\nthey've got a 64 bit version.\n\n844\n00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:44,405\nAnd they've got an MSI or\nan EXE installer.\n\n845\n00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:50,270\nSo I can choose either one will install\nRD Tabs, I get the software either way.\n\n846\n00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,780\nSo what the heck is this MSI one?\n\n847\n00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,050\nWhy do that if we've already\ngot an executable one?\n\n848\n00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,210\n>> That's a great example, Don.\n\n849\n00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,690\nI'm glad- [LAUGH]\n>> I try.\n\n850\n00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,640\n>> Did you plan that?\n\n851\n00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,170\n>> No, I just thought of\nit when you were talking.\n\n852\n00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,245\nSo-\n>> So well, thanks.\n\n853\n00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:03,490\n>> I'm not that prepared.\n\n854\n00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,580\n>> So MSI, what's so\ngreat about MSI installers?\n\n855\n00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,380\nWell these MSI installers they\ncontain little instructions,\n\n856\n00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:19,440\nmore or less, that tell Windows\nwhere it puts everything.\n\n857\n00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,860\nWhen you install an app a game or\nsomething with this MSI Extension.\n\n858\n00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,800\nIt says, okay, I'm putting stuff here,\nI'm putting stuff here.\n\n859\n00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800\nWell what, why?\n\n860\n00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,400\nWho really cares?\n\n861\n00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,630\nWell, when it comes time\nto uninstall things.\n\n862\n00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,880\nIt's a much cleaner\nuninstallation of that app.\n\n863\n00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,580\nIt doesn't leave little traces,\nfolders settings,\n\n864\n00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,680\neverything left behind,\nsome EXE installers.\n\n865\n00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,360\nI don't know, Don,\nhave you uninstalled something.\n\n866\n00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,120\nAnd then you go back and\n\n867\n00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,857\nit's left all its folders around-\n>> Yeah.\n\n868\n00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:53,030\n>> And it's left stuff\nscattered all over the place.\n\n869\n00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,310\n>> Yeah, and you see that a lot when\nit was installed with an EXE instead\n\n870\n00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,260\nof an MSI.\n\n871\n00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,980\nBecause it's up to that software to\nremove its files when you uninstall it.\n\n872\n00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,460\nIf you install with an EXE.\n\n873\n00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,770\nIf you install it with an MSI,\nWindows takes care of it and\n\n874\n00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,180\nit's much more thorough.\n\n875\n00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,950\n>> Yup.\n>> Yeah.\n\n876\n00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,600\n>> And another good thing with MSIs,\nyou can repair it.\n\n877\n00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,880\nSo there's a repair option and it will go.\n\n878\n00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,710\nAnd I guess kind of unpack itself again,\nand fix things.\n\n879\n00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,870\nThat's yeah, it's real nice,\nreal convenient.\n\n880\n00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,910\n>> Yeah.\nSo if a file gets accidentally deleted,\n\n881\n00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,210\nsomething like that, it can repair it and\nget back up in business.\n\n882\n00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,960\n>> Yep.\nAnd one last thing with these MSI is that\n\n883\n00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,990\nyou can install it from\nthe command line using a cool tool\n\n884\n00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:43,630\ncalled Msiexec, scripts and stuff.\n\n885\n00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,440\nThere you go.\n\n886\n00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,465\nWe got a little pop up box.\n\n887\n00:44:48,465 --> 00:44:50,873\nSo-\n>> It is little.\n\n888\n00:44:50,873 --> 00:44:53,940\n[LAUGH]\n>> Msiexec.\n\n889\n00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:00,430\nSo we've got different switches and\nthings doing install apps certain ways.\n\n890\n00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:05,020\nThere's something to point\nout is the quiet option.\n\n891\n00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,230\nQuiet option right there,\nno user interaction.\n\n892\n00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:12,178\nSo just installs things with the.\n\n893\n00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:18,253\n>> I was gonna try and make it\nbigger since I can barely read that.\n\n894\n00:45:18,253 --> 00:45:19,838\nAnd I'm standing here at the computer.\n\n895\n00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:29,305\nThere we, now we're talking.\n\n896\n00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:31,012\nAll right.\n\n897\n00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:32,048\n[CROSSTALK] Now we can actually.\n\n898\n00:45:32,048 --> 00:45:34,303\n>> That worked out really well.\n\n899\n00:45:34,303 --> 00:45:35,600\n>> You'd almost think I\nknew what I was doing.\n\n900\n00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,188\n>> Right on.\nDid you plan that?\n\n901\n00:45:37,188 --> 00:45:38,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n902\n00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,890\nThere's some of our [INAUDIBLE].\n\n903\n00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,380\nScroll down slightly.\n\n904\n00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,780\nToo to point out, quiet and passive.\n\n905\n00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:52,170\nSo quiet mode, no user interaction,\nit more or less,\n\n906\n00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,510\njust basically accepts the defaults for\neverything.\n\n907\n00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:57,180\nJust like next, next, next, next,\nand just installs things that way.\n\n908\n00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:00,490\nPassive mode.\n\n909\n00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,770\nSo it doesn't pop anything up.\n\n910\n00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:07,630\nYou don't see the little installer and\nall the next stuff and everything.\n\n911\n00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,300\nYou just see a little progress bar, and\nthe thing comes up and just 0 to 100,\n\n912\n00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,670\nand installs everything.\n\n913\n00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,150\nYeah, so those would be two switches.\n\n914\n00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,120\n>> Yeah,\nif you're a network administrator and\n\n915\n00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,920\nyou're about to roll this\nsoftware out over the network.\n\n916\n00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,730\nYou may want to silently push it out.\n\n917\n00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,120\nSo that the end users don't\neven know it's happening.\n\n918\n00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,050\nOne moment they don't have a program,\nthe next moment they do.\n\n919\n00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,420\nAnd that's where that quiet\ntag comes in really handy.\n\n920\n00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,450\nYou can push that software out over the\nnetwork, the end users don't even see it.\n\n921\n00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,940\nPassive, the end users do know,\nthey know something's going on.\n\n922\n00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,560\nAnd some times that's a good idea too.\n\n923\n00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:43,460\nBecause their computer might slow down\na bit while it's installing the software.\n\n924\n00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,720\nSo it'd be nice to at least\ngive them a progress bar, so\n\n925\n00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,800\nthey knew that something was going on.\n\n926\n00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,130\nBut in passive mode, they see the progress\nbar but they can't interact with it.\n\n927\n00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,110\nThey don't have any questions to answer.\n\n928\n00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,910\nIt's still done unattended.\n\n929\n00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,783\nThey don't have to interact\nwith the installer at all.\n\n930\n00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,603\n>> Yup.\n\n931\n00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:02,123\nNice.\nYes.\n\n932\n00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:05,870\nWell, should we install something with it?\n\n933\n00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:06,480\n>> Absolutely.\n\n934\n00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,230\nWhy don't we jump over\nto your machine Nate?\n\n935\n00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,959\nShow them how it's done.\n\n936\n00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,620\n>> Nice.\n\n937\n00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:20,208\nSo with all things we'll start with\nadministrative command prompt.\n\n938\n00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:27,376\nWe've got a couple of files in here\nthat we can pick from to install.\n\n939\n00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:31,749\n[SOUND] Don, so you've got your choice.\n\n940\n00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,315\nSo we've got Armageddatron?\n\n941\n00:47:34,315 --> 00:47:36,130\n>> Okay.\n\n942\n00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,990\n>> We've got Mouse without Borders,\nbecause I needed that one the other day.\n\n943\n00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,755\nOr the Steam installer.\n\n944\n00:47:41,755 --> 00:47:43,225\n>> Mouse without Borders is lame.\n\n945\n00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:46,588\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So what do you think, Tron or\n\n946\n00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:47,555\nSteam?\n\n947\n00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:48,715\nLet's go Steam.\n\n948\n00:47:48,715 --> 00:47:50,365\nEverybody runs Steam, right?\n\n949\n00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:52,375\n>> Yep, Steam installer sweet.\n\n950\n00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:57,440\nSo then with all the other things, we\nwill browse, we'll browse that directory.\n\n951\n00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,125\nAnd there is our, oops,\nnot that one, sorry, oops.\n\n952\n00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:04,752\n>> It's your data downloads.\n\n953\n00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,238\n>> There we go.\n\n954\n00:48:15,238 --> 00:48:18,615\nSo the command that we'll run, msiexec.\n\n955\n00:48:18,615 --> 00:48:25,290\nAnd we're gonna use the slash i switch for\ninstall.\n\n956\n00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:30,390\nAnd then we will just\nspecify right as our thing.\n\n957\n00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:38,230\nNow, oh yeah,\nI didn't put any of the switches in there.\n\n958\n00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:43,870\nBut yeah, so just double-clicking on\nthe MSI pulls up the same kind of thing.\n\n959\n00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,710\nRunning it from the command prompt,\npulls the same thing up.\n\n960\n00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,340\nWe can run through and next, next, next.\n\n961\n00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,570\n>> And he didn't do /q or whatever,\nso we are getting prompts.\n\n962\n00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:58,105\nWe are seeing interaction because of that.\n\n963\n00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:06,509\nSo this time, he did /quiet.\n\n964\n00:49:06,509 --> 00:49:10,810\nSo it shouldn't ask us for\ninteraction, but he did /passive also.\n\n965\n00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,085\nSo we do see the progress bar and\nit's already done, isn't it?\n\n966\n00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:15,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's pretty impressive.\n\n967\n00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,420\nWhen it doesn't ask us questions,\nit gets done really fast.\n\n968\n00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,645\n>> So yeah, so Don, what we could do is,\nwe could use this and\n\n969\n00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:27,095\npush out the Steam installer to all\nthe machines that we've got running here.\n\n970\n00:49:27,095 --> 00:49:28,675\nI mean test it out, right?\n\n971\n00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,565\n>> Absolutely right.\n\n972\n00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:32,925\nIt may be a necessary example.\n\n973\n00:49:32,925 --> 00:49:35,875\n>> Yeah, we could try it.\n\n974\n00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:39,325\n>> Now can you show them that\nSteam's actually installed?\n\n975\n00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:43,145\nThe icons and all that,\ndid it get added to Metro?\n\n976\n00:49:43,145 --> 00:49:45,050\nI mean the modern UI?\n\n977\n00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,389\n>> Yup.\n>> Oh it's covered up-\n\n978\n00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:48,946\n>> Oh, oh, oh, man.\n\n979\n00:49:48,946 --> 00:49:50,990\n>> With your giant head.\n\n980\n00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,141\n>> Don, gosh.\n\n981\n00:49:58,141 --> 00:50:01,958\n[SOUND] And Steam.\n\n982\n00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,903\n>> You're doing this the hard way.\n\n983\n00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,090\n>> Well.\n>> I just, yeah there you go, okay.\n\n984\n00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:06,100\nThere it is.\n>> All right, there we go.\n\n985\n00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,850\n>> So Steam is installed even though\nwe didn't see all the next, next,\n\n986\n00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:10,840\nnext screens.\n\n987\n00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,800\nIt's installed.\n\n988\n00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,540\nIt's there.\n\n989\n00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,620\nAnd it is in theory happy.\n\n990\n00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,940\n>> With the hardware,\nhow else would you have done it?\n\n991\n00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,530\n>> If I.\n>> Just double-click on Steam.\n\n992\n00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,280\n>> Well I want to show, yeah I guess.\n\n993\n00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,572\n>> Oh you mean define it.\n\n994\n00:50:24,572 --> 00:50:27,090\nI would've just pulled up\nthe modern UI screen and\n\n995\n00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,150\ntyped Steam and\nit would have been right there.\n\n996\n00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,680\n>> I don't see it on your's though.\n\n997\n00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,890\n>> I'm on my studio machine.\n\n998\n00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:37,038\nI, unlike some people,\ndon't install Steam on my work computer.\n\n999\n00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:39,220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, yeah.\n\n1000\n00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,840\nGood point.\n\n1001\n00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,565\n>> Anyhow.\n[LAUGH] But yeah, had you done that,\n\n1002\n00:50:42,565 --> 00:50:46,612\nyou would have found it instead\nof going through all that.\n\n1003\n00:50:46,612 --> 00:50:48,010\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yup.\n\n1004\n00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:48,510\nThere it is.\n\n1005\n00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,470\n>> Do you think we have time for\nuninstall?\n\n1006\n00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,140\nWe got a couple minutes.\n\n1007\n00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,459\nProbably enough for uninstall, right?\n\n1008\n00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,770\nSo uninstalling an app can\nbe done a couple of ways.\n\n1009\n00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:03,970\nAnd one way is to go into\nour Control Panel and\n\n1010\n00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:06,760\ngo into the Programs and\nFeatures screen where we can uninstall it.\n\n1011\n00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,040\nAnd Nate are you, yeah,\nNate's pulling that up right now.\n\n1012\n00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,370\nSo what he's doing is he's\ngoing into his Control Panel.\n\n1013\n00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,970\nHe's going into, what's it called?\n\n1014\n00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,010\nThe program, Programs and Features.\n\n1015\n00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:18,910\nI was right.\n\n1016\n00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:22,968\nAnd then, you can find your program\nin that list, and choose it and\n\n1017\n00:51:22,968 --> 00:51:23,992\nhit uninstall.\n\n1018\n00:51:23,992 --> 00:51:29,014\nSo if you wanted to uninstall the three\nversions of Ski Freeze that are installed.\n\n1019\n00:51:29,014 --> 00:51:32,026\nYou could click on it and hit uninstall.\n\n1020\n00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:34,510\nThis is an interactive uninstall.\n\n1021\n00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:37,960\nIn other words the end user has\nto initiate it, re-see it and\n\n1022\n00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,080\nyou kinda go through this process.\n\n1023\n00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,520\nThis is the way we\nuninstall most software.\n\n1024\n00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,340\n>> Yep, yeah.\n\n1025\n00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,740\nOf course,\nwhen I have to uninstall something,\n\n1026\n00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,220\nI always have to go into\nthis Control Panel and\n\n1027\n00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,880\nthen uninstall programs this way.\n\n1028\n00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,925\nNow with Steam, since it was that cool\nMSI file, going into its properties here.\n\n1029\n00:51:56,925 --> 00:52:02,210\nSo we've got repair, so you can repair\nit right from the installer, and\n\n1030\n00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,993\nthen we have an uninstall,\nright there from the uninstaller.\n\n1031\n00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:09,260\nGot the stuff there and then Programs and\n\n1032\n00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,560\nFeatures are more than one way\nto go about doing something.\n\n1033\n00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,220\n>> Yep, a little easier there.\n\n1034\n00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:17,550\nSo definitely a cool feature,\nthat's with an MSI install,\n\n1035\n00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,040\nif you install with EXE\nyou don't get that.\n\n1036\n00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,230\nSo if something's going wrong with Steam,\nif it's not working quite right,\n\n1037\n00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:28,960\nyou could right click on the MSI or come\nin here, choose repair, and it'll replace\n\n1038\n00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,450\nall the files in fresh copies, so\nthat hopefully it fixes the problem.\n\n1039\n00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,720\nYou can uninstall and\n\n1040\n00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,220\nthen it'll remove itself, and get Nate's\nlaptop back into workplace compliance.\n\n1041\n00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,980\n>> Right, yeah, you know, man,\ngosh, we're going to have to start\n\n1042\n00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,260\nusing your computer for everything if-\n>> I know.\n\n1043\n00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:49,630\nIf I, just so you guys know,\nI use the same laptop on and off the air.\n\n1044\n00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:55,310\nWhen I'm on the air, I do a boot from\nVHD to a nice clean Windows 8 install.\n\n1045\n00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:59,660\nBut when the show is done,\nI flip it back into personal mode and\n\n1046\n00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:04,360\nI got Steam and all that other\nstuff is running on that one too.\n\n1047\n00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,140\n>> So you switch to that one\nright after the show is over?\n\n1048\n00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,820\n>> Immediately after the show.\n\n1049\n00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,440\nI'm hitting reboot as\nthe credits are rolling.\n\n1050\n00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,870\nThat's a-\n>> So I said, so\n\n1051\n00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:13,990\nyou do have Steam install?\n\n1052\n00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right.\n\n1053\n00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,030\nWell, how come you had\nnever added me as a friend?\n\n1054\n00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,000\n>> We're not Steam friends?\n\n1055\n00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,560\n>> No.\n\n1056\n00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,500\n>> I'll have to do that after\nI reboot after the show.\n\n1057\n00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,230\nGee.\n\n1058\n00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:23,768\n>> All right.\n\n1059\n00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:27,510\n>> Anyhow [LAUGH] and most of the time,\n\n1060\n00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,385\nI don't Steam friend people\ncuz they're better than me.\n\n1061\n00:53:29,385 --> 00:53:32,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't like getting shot in the face.\n\n1062\n00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,540\nNothing worse than like I'll\nplay a video game at home.\n\n1063\n00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,830\nI'm like, I'm really good at it.\n\n1064\n00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:42,050\nThen you go online, and\nsome 12 year-old kid from Muskegon,\n\n1065\n00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,530\nMichigan, shoots you in two seconds.\n\n1066\n00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:49,110\nMy self-esteem gets ruined.\n\n1067\n00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,110\n>> My Wii right?\n\n1068\n00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,180\nI take the Wii everywhere and\nplay the stuff.\n\n1069\n00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:56,500\nI don't have any high score,\nright, on any of my Wii games.\n\n1070\n00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,620\nThey're just taking over all\nmy friends and everything.\n\n1071\n00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,040\nI don't know.\n\n1072\n00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,970\nI'm too casual of a player I guess.\n\n1073\n00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,430\n>> Yep, you're not hardcore enough.\n\n1074\n00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,280\nMaybe we'll take that on as a second job.\n\n1075\n00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,590\nWe ran right up to the break here,\nso let's see.\n\n1076\n00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,720\nI think we're pretty much\ndone with msiexec right?\n\n1077\n00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,410\nYou got anything else on that one?\n\n1078\n00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,800\n>> Oh no, we're good.\n\n1079\n00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,540\n>> Okay.\n\n1080\n00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,800\nWhen we get back, we're gonna talk\na little bit more about file associations,\n\n1081\n00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,220\ntalk a little bit about App-V,\nsome crazy things.\n\n1082\n00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,520\nAnd then we're gonna jump\ninto the Windows 8 store.\n\n1083\n00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,310\nThe all new application environment\navailable in Windows 8.\n\n1084\n00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,070\nSo a lot of things have changed,\ndefinitely need to get into that for\n\n1085\n00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,880\nthe exam, and that's all I got for now.\n\n1086\n00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,670\nHow about you?\n\n1087\n00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,010\n>> Yep, we're good.\n\n1088\n00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,060\n>> Let's take a break!\n\n1089\n00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,095\nWhen we get back, more fun stuff.\n\n1090\n00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:46,688\n[SOUND] Welcome back,\n\n1091\n00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:50,721\neverybody.\n\n1092\n00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:53,669\nWe've moved through quite\na bit of material so far,\n\n1093\n00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:55,414\nas far as our exam objectives.\n\n1094\n00:54:55,414 --> 00:54:58,729\nWe got some neat little,\nI'm gonna call them after thoughts.\n\n1095\n00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:02,506\nMicrosoft Afterthoughts,\non installing programs.\n\n1096\n00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:03,224\n>> Dun dun dun.\n\n1097\n00:55:03,224 --> 00:55:05,830\n>> [LAUGH] They probably\nwouldn't be too happy with that.\n\n1098\n00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:11,040\nBut anyhow, as we start to install more\nand more software on our computers,\n\n1099\n00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,160\neach computer is generally\nassociated with a file type.\n\n1100\n00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,490\nAnd by file type,\nI'm really talking about a file extension.\n\n1101\n00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,667\nSo for example, Microsoft Word.\n\n1102\n00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:23,858\nWhen Microsoft Word saves a document,\nit'll be a file name and\n\n1103\n00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:27,667\nthen a period, and then docx,\nor doc for the older ones.\n\n1104\n00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:31,208\nAnd you have text files in .txt, and\n\n1105\n00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:36,254\nExcel files in and .xls,\njpegs pictures in .jpg.\n\n1106\n00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:38,540\nThese are all file extensions.\n\n1107\n00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,640\nAnd your installed software\nmay be able to open them.\n\n1108\n00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,810\nSo, as part of the install process\na lot of them will create little\n\n1109\n00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:48,540\nregistry entries that say, hey,\nI can open up jpeg software.\n\n1110\n00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,840\nAnd if nobody else is opening\nup jpeg pictures at that point,\n\n1111\n00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:57,780\nthen it may takeover as the default and\nnow that's the go to program to open it.\n\n1112\n00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,670\nIf there are other programs\nthat might open it though,\n\n1113\n00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,000\nit may not become the default.\n\n1114\n00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,485\nSo it's kind of a crapshoot.\n\n1115\n00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:03,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As to whether or\n\n1116\n00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:06,000\nnot it's actually gonna open\nup the jpegs by default.\n\n1117\n00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,790\nSo we may need to get in there and\nmodify that.\n\n1118\n00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,610\nAnd that's what we're\ngoing to look at now.\n\n1119\n00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:10,520\n>> So Don, let me ask you.\n\n1120\n00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,500\nSo every extension, right, that we have,\n\n1121\n00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,280\nis there always going to be a default for\nsomething?\n\n1122\n00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,570\nIs there going to be one\nperson that wins all the time?\n\n1123\n00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:24,420\n>> Just by the definition of the word\ndefault, there can be only one, right?\n\n1124\n00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,490\nIt's like Highlander.\n\n1125\n00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:30,150\nSo, in Windows,\nthere's either going to be a default or\n\n1126\n00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,400\nthere's going to be nobody, right?\n\n1127\n00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,290\nAnd so, if you double click on a jpeg,\n\n1128\n00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:40,030\nright, and you've got a default,\nthe JPEG will open up in that default.\n\n1129\n00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,770\nBut if you click on a JPEG and\n\n1130\n00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:45,950\nthere is no default, then you'll\nget a Windows pop-up that will say,\n\n1131\n00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:51,100\nwhat program would you like to use to open\nthis file, or data or whatever it says.\n\n1132\n00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:56,880\nAnd then you've got your list of all\nthe various programs to pick from.\n\n1133\n00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,790\n>> All right, so yeah.\n\n1134\n00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,840\nTalking about configuring\ndefault programs.\n\n1135\n00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,180\nI guess we can configure\nsome default programs.\n\n1136\n00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,500\n>> Well that sounds like a plan.\n\n1137\n00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,640\nYou'd almost think that's\nwhat we had to do.\n\n1138\n00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,590\nSo basically a lot of times this is\nsomething that's done automatically for\n\n1139\n00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:12,370\nus, right?\n\n1140\n00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:15,190\nYou install the software, it automatically\nhooks onto those file extensions,\n\n1141\n00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:16,220\nand you're done.\n\n1142\n00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,730\nSometimes we have to get involved though,\nright?\n\n1143\n00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,570\nSo Nate, do you want to,\nactually you know what?\n\n1144\n00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,850\nLet's start with well,\nlets stick with file associations,\n\n1145\n00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:25,940\nbecause that's what I jumped on.\n\n1146\n00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,030\nI know, in the show notes,\nwe've got default programs first.\n\n1147\n00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:34,974\nSo lets do file associations first, and\nthen we'll talk about default programs.\n\n1148\n00:57:34,974 --> 00:57:35,550\nSounds good?\n\n1149\n00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:36,870\n>> All right, yeah, sure.\n\n1150\n00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,130\n>> Have I thrown you completely?\n\n1151\n00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,740\n>> Oh no, no, no that's fine,\nI mean I'll adapt to it.\n\n1152\n00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:44,580\nSo we're going to start with extensions,\nright?\n\n1153\n00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,330\n>> Yes.\n\n1154\n00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,400\nYes.\n\n1155\n00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,250\n>> All right, sweet.\nAll right, well yeah.\n\n1156\n00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,510\nSo then we browse into my computer, right?\n\n1157\n00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:55,280\nAnd we'll go into my user profile.\n\n1158\n00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,650\nThat's kind of a long\nway of going about it.\n\n1159\n00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:00,699\nAll right, so\nwe've got some pictures there,\n\n1160\n00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:04,090\nprofile pictures and\nsome different backgrounds.\n\n1161\n00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:04,692\nRight.\n\n1162\n00:58:04,692 --> 00:58:07,219\nSo we'll take this one right here.\n\n1163\n00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:08,355\nThis nice white on.\n\n1164\n00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:10,470\nAll right, when we double click on it.\n\n1165\n00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:13,480\nRight?\nIt opens up in the Windows 8,\n\n1166\n00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,920\nmodern style Windows 8 thing.\n\n1167\n00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,880\nLets say we don't wanna use that, right?\n\n1168\n00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,250\nAnd its personally not my favorite.\n\n1169\n00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:27,260\nSo what we can do then,\nis we can right-click on it, right?\n\n1170\n00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:31,250\nAnd Open With, and then here's\none that we can pick from right?\n\n1171\n00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:35,178\nWe can choose Default Program.\n\n1172\n00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,059\nRight?\n\n1173\n00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:41,160\nAnd here's the little menu again,\nwe can click on more options and\n\n1174\n00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,485\nit gives us some more stuff,\nit's kind of a little simple way.\n\n1175\n00:58:45,485 --> 00:58:47,610\nSo we can click on that.\n\n1176\n00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,980\nThere we go, and click on it again.\n\n1177\n00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,610\nAnd there, yeah, it opens up.\n\n1178\n00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:56,420\n>> Now, you might ask yourself,\nwait a minute, why does that\n\n1179\n00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:00,632\nchoice menu whatever show up\ntwice even though it's the same?\n\n1180\n00:59:00,632 --> 00:59:01,240\nRight?\nSo\n\n1181\n00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,870\nthere is actually a subtle\ndifference between that.\n\n1182\n00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,720\nAnd you've already set yours so\nlet me bring it up on mine here.\n\n1183\n00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,153\nSo I'll show them kind of a like you said,\na second time.\n\n1184\n00:59:11,153 --> 00:59:12,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That first menu.\n\n1185\n00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:17,488\nIf you right-click on a picture, and so\nI'll take one of these wallpapers here.\n\n1186\n00:59:17,488 --> 00:59:22,100\nIf you right-click on it, and you go\nto Open With, and you pick Paint, or\n\n1187\n00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,760\nWindows Photo Viewer, right?\n\n1188\n00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,645\nThat's a one time time thing.\n\n1189\n00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:29,355\nIt'll open up in paint now but next time\nit'll go back to it's default, right.\n\n1190\n00:59:29,355 --> 00:59:34,230\nSo like if I open up this wallpaper, here\nit is open in the Windows Photo Viewer\n\n1191\n00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:38,440\ncuz I I have that set as my default and\nthen if I right-click on it and\n\n1192\n00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:43,080\nchoose open with Paint,\nit will open it in Paint, right?\n\n1193\n00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,680\nSo there it is in Paint.\n\n1194\n00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,642\nAnd if I close that, and\njust open it by double clicking,\n\n1195\n00:59:47,642 --> 00:59:51,730\nit doesn't go on to Paint, it goes\nback in to the Windows Photo Viewer.\n\n1196\n00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:56,272\nSo that right-click, and Open With,\nthat's just a one time override.\n\n1197\n00:59:56,272 --> 00:59:57,270\nAll right?\n\n1198\n00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:01,070\nBut if you go to Choose Default Program\nlike Nate did, I don't want to\n\n1199\n01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:05,860\ncall it permanent cuz we can change it,\nbut it's a static override.\n\n1200\n01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,500\nI don't know what the right word is there.\n\n1201\n01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,060\nBut basically that changes it and so\n\n1202\n01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,230\nfrom now on it will open up in\nwhatever that other program is.\n\n1203\n01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,640\n>> Persistent.\n\n1204\n01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,830\n>> Good choice, persistent.\n\n1205\n01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:19,430\nSo that setting stays, it is persistent,\nand then you open up in that new program.\n\n1206\n01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,070\nSo if you want to change it long term,\n\n1207\n01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:26,175\nif you really hate that Metro modern\nUI photo viewer like most of us do.\n\n1208\n01:00:26,175 --> 01:00:28,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then you can override it and\n\n1209\n01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:28,579\nnot mess with it again.\n\n1210\n01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,300\n>> Yup, sweet.\n\n1211\n01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,070\nThank you Don.\n\n1212\n01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,420\n>> Yup.\n>> All right, now there is a, oh wait.\n\n1213\n01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,080\nWere you going to say something?\n\n1214\n01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:35,640\n>> Nope.\nNo, no, no.\n\n1215\n01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,640\n>> Are you sure?\n>> That's all I got.\n\n1216\n01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,180\nI mean, how far can we go on default?\n\n1217\n01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:43,160\nI guess we could show them that\ngiant list of the file extensions.\n\n1218\n01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,420\n>> Oh yeah, I think we should.\n\n1219\n01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:47,840\n>> Let's, you got that handy on yours,\nor I can put it up on mine.\n\n1220\n01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,280\n>> Yeah, either or, we can\n>> It's a race.\n\n1221\n01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,170\nWho can get there first.\n\n1222\n01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:52,804\n>> We'll both open it.\n\n1223\n01:00:52,804 --> 01:00:54,565\n>> And I'm there.\n\n1224\n01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:57,090\nAll right, champion.\n\n1225\n01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,800\n>> I grabbed the mouse.\n\n1226\n01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,568\n>> So let me show you guys how I\nget to things faster than Nate.\n\n1227\n01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:06,950\nIn Windows 8,\nwhen you bring up your modern UI,\n\n1228\n01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,910\nit's really cool because you can just\ntype things and it will find it.\n\n1229\n01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,960\nYou don't have to worry about\nwhere to click and go into stuff.\n\n1230\n01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,610\nSo I just brought it up and\ntyped file extensions.\n\n1231\n01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,810\nNow notice it didn't find anything.\n\n1232\n01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,560\nThat's something they\nfixed in Windows 8.1, but\n\n1233\n01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,250\nhere in Windows 8 I can click on,\ndadgummit, I can click on Settings and\n\n1234\n01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,102\nI'll see right here Show or\nhide file extensions,\n\n1235\n01:01:30,102 --> 01:01:33,730\nmake it change the file type\nassociated with the file extension.\n\n1236\n01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,740\nAnd that's what I wanted and that's what\nbrought me to this screen right here.\n\n1237\n01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,650\nAnd this screen is a gigantic list.\n\n1238\n01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:45,690\nIt's a list of every single extension that\nis registered with Windows right now.\n\n1239\n01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,910\nIt changes as you install software.\n\n1240\n01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,620\nAnd then it shows me what\nprogram would be able to use it.\n\n1241\n01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:53,390\nAnd you'll see a lot of them\njust say unknown application,\n\n1242\n01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,100\nthat means they have no default.\n\n1243\n01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,320\nBut many of them do actually have one.\n\n1244\n01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,140\nSo like .bmp is set to open\nwith the Windows Photo Viewer.\n\n1245\n01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,280\nSo I can change it here, but\nthis is definitely the hard way,\n\n1246\n01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,690\nthis is not the easy way.\n\n1247\n01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:08,850\nEasy way is to just right click on one\nof the files, and choose Open With.\n\n1248\n01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,251\n>> So let's say you had a bunch of\nextensions that you want to change all at\n\n1249\n01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:13,470\nonce, right?\n\n1250\n01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:17,620\nSo you don't want to go through and\nnavigate your whole file structure and\n\n1251\n01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,480\nfind you PDF's, and change that.\n\n1252\n01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,450\nOr find your JPEG's, or\nwhatever and whatnot.\n\n1253\n01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:26,000\nSo you can go to this menu.\n\n1254\n01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,630\nThis menu here.\n\n1255\n01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,070\n>> You can do more than one?\n\n1256\n01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,110\n>> What?\nWell, no I,\n\n1257\n01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:32,290\nI so then you wouldn't have to go through\nlike all your folders and stuff and\n\n1258\n01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:32,800\nfind everything.\n\n1259\n01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,190\nYou could just scroll down the list.\n\n1260\n01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,340\n>> Oh, I see what you're saying,\nall right.\n\n1261\n01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,530\n>> And change all your stuff.\n\n1262\n01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:38,820\n>> I thought you might be indicating\nthat you could highlight only.\n\n1263\n01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,540\nI'm just going to test it.\n\n1264\n01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,875\nCan you highlight more than one?\n\n1265\n01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:41,960\nCuz now I'm curious.\n\n1266\n01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,140\nNo, looks like you can't.\n\n1267\n01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:43,760\nOkay.\nAll right.\n\n1268\n01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,360\nBut you are right.\n\n1269\n01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,470\nYeah, they'll all be right here so\nI can go and hit BMP and then GIF and\n\n1270\n01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:52,670\nPNG, and all those picture ones,\nget them set for Windows Photo Viewer.\n\n1271\n01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,700\n>> Yep.\nNow, it is a little tedious,\n\n1272\n01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,970\nright, to go this way and whatnot.\n\n1273\n01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,820\nWell, let's say you just\nwant to use Photo Viewer for\n\n1274\n01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:03,040\neverything that Photo Viewer can open.\n\n1275\n01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,760\nRight?\n\n1276\n01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,490\nThere's an option for that.\n\n1277\n01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,800\n>> There's an app for that?\n\n1278\n01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,790\n>> Yeah.\nThere is.\n\n1279\n01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:09,970\n>> All right, you want to tackle that one?\n\n1280\n01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,010\n>> Oh yeah, sure.\n\n1281\n01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:15,030\nSo I'll show you the way that I\nget to these programs, right?\n\n1282\n01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:18,015\nSo I go to my start screen and\nI type in default.\n\n1283\n01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n1284\n01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,270\nRight.\nSo now we're in here, and\n\n1285\n01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:27,810\nthe one that we're going to look at\nright now is set your default program.\n\n1286\n01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,542\nAll right.\n\n1287\n01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:35,380\nSo now, now this is, it's more or less\nlike the exact opposite The same idea,\n\n1288\n01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:41,400\nbut the exact different way of going\nabout, by doing the file extensions.\n\n1289\n01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,210\nSo now we can go through, let's find that.\n\n1290\n01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:47,544\n>> So instead of picking what\nprogram goes with an extension,\n\n1291\n01:03:47,544 --> 01:03:51,018\nhere we pick what extensions\ngo with a program.\n\n1292\n01:03:51,018 --> 01:03:52,435\nSo, you pick a program, and\n\n1293\n01:03:52,435 --> 01:03:55,756\nyou can pick all the different\nextension to be associated with it.\n\n1294\n01:03:55,756 --> 01:04:02,346\n>> Right now,\nthis program has one out of 12 defaults.\n\n1295\n01:04:02,346 --> 01:04:09,400\nSo it can open 12 things and I only have\nit selected as a default for one of them.\n\n1296\n01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,870\nNow, we can click here, so\nthis program has default.\n\n1297\n01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:16,310\nAnd it will automatically set\nthe photo viewer as the default for\n\n1298\n01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,930\nevery file type it can open.\n\n1299\n01:04:19,092 --> 01:04:23,780\nWe can choose the second one,\nto go through and pick which one\n\n1300\n01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:27,938\nof the extensions it can open for\nits default.\n\n1301\n01:04:27,938 --> 01:04:32,440\n>> Yeah, you might want jpg and png,, but\n\n1302\n01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,380\nif you look at the list there might be\nsomething in there that you don't want.\n\n1303\n01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:39,050\nAlthough, offhand I don't see\nany that are jumping out at me.\n\n1304\n01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,130\nBut you know, there might be something\nyou don't want that program to open.\n\n1305\n01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:44,300\nActually, I do this with 7-Zip a lot,\n\n1306\n01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,760\nwhere 7-Zip can open up ISO files, but\nI don't want to use it for ISO files.\n\n1307\n01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,410\nI want to use the Windows\nmount utility for that.\n\n1308\n01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:54,070\nAnd so that's an extension that I\nwouldn't want to use with it, but\n\n1309\n01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,330\nI might want want all the other ones.\n\n1310\n01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:56,820\nYeah, you can pick and\nchoose, very cool stuff.\n\n1311\n01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:02,970\n>> I still have 7-Zip installed\non the studio computer.\n\n1312\n01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:05,655\nCuz otherwise, well,\nlet's look at 7-Zip right now.\n\n1313\n01:05:05,655 --> 01:05:06,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yep.\n\n1314\n01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,429\n>> Yeah, that is one though, and\n\n1315\n01:05:08,429 --> 01:05:11,130\none that I find that I have\nto override myself, yep.\n\n1316\n01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:15,360\n>> All right,\nnow in our default program stuff, right?\n\n1317\n01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,730\nSo we just looked at\nthe set default programs.\n\n1318\n01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:23,590\nAssociate a file type or\nprotocol with a program and this is a,\n\n1319\n01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:27,820\nDon, wait, is this the list\nthat we looked at on yours?\n\n1320\n01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:32,230\n>> Yes, I just didn't go all the way\nto the bottom where the protocols are.\n\n1321\n01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,390\n>> All right, so there's that list.\n\n1322\n01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,440\n>> We have auto play stuff, but\nwe won't cover that right now.\n\n1323\n01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,440\nThen we have this one,\nset program access and computer defaults.\n\n1324\n01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:50,370\nNow this one is kind of like,\na suite of different programs.\n\n1325\n01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:52,190\nWe can set Microsoft windows.\n\n1326\n01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:55,930\nSo all the Microsoft built-in tools,\nwe can go right here, and\n\n1327\n01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:59,350\nset them as the default for\nall the stuff that it can open.\n\n1328\n01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,710\nWe can do the non-Microsoft stuff.\n\n1329\n01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:05,870\nSo everything that is non-Microsoft\nwe have installed on the computer,\n\n1330\n01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:11,050\nwe can quickly set those to do\nthe default for all of our others.\n\n1331\n01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,910\nOr, what I would choose, is a custom, and\n\n1332\n01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:18,980\ngo through each one and\nchoose what I want to, open what.\n\n1333\n01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,400\n>> You know where I find myself\ncoming here is web browsers.\n\n1334\n01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,880\nBy default Internet Explorer's,\nthe default web browser in Windows.\n\n1335\n01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,060\nSo if you click on an HTML link or\n\n1336\n01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,340\nwhatever, it's gonna take\nyou into Internet Explorer.\n\n1337\n01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:34,490\nBut I might install Google Chrome or\nOpera or Firefox or something like that.\n\n1338\n01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,390\nAnd I wanna use those instead.\n\n1339\n01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,340\nAnd so you can come in here,\nand you can say,\n\n1340\n01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:41,200\nhey when I open up a webpage,\nuse this browser.\n\n1341\n01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,990\nSo you'll see on Nate's screen there,\nchoose default web browser and\n\n1342\n01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:49,320\nhe's got, my current web browser\nis set to Internet Explorer.\n\n1343\n01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,400\nInternet Explorer is the only\none you have installed.\n\n1344\n01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,920\n>> Actually that's the only\none that you need.\n\n1345\n01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,790\nRight Don?\n\n1346\n01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:59,240\n>> Let me show you on mine\nsince I have Chrome installed.\n\n1347\n01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,430\nI get really frustrated\nwith Internet Explorer.\n\n1348\n01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:04,440\nSo here on mine, you'll see where\nI've used my current web browser.\n\n1349\n01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,180\nThat's whatever I've got picked now.\n\n1350\n01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:09,722\nOr I can pick between Google Chrome and\nInternet Explorer, so\n\n1351\n01:07:09,722 --> 01:07:13,440\nthere's my choice between those two and\nI can set that default one.\n\n1352\n01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,930\nThis is going through the set program\naccess and default, and going to custom.\n\n1353\n01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:23,430\nIf I went with Microsoft, see how it\nsays web browser Internet Explorer?\n\n1354\n01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:28,390\nBut, if I choose to go to non-Microsoft,\nlike that.\n\n1355\n01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,000\nSee how it shows Google Chrome?\n\n1356\n01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,120\nSo it's picking that\nnon-Microsoft program.\n\n1357\n01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,450\nSo, it's up to you which\none you wanna use,\n\n1358\n01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,280\nit's all based on your own preferences.\n\n1359\n01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,580\nCustom is kinda nice,\ncuz you can pick and choose for\n\n1360\n01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:43,210\neach of the different\ncomponents inside of that.\n\n1361\n01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:46,330\n>> Now with all things,\nsettings and everything for\n\n1362\n01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:51,720\nthe computer, these can also be set\nif you're in a domain environment.\n\n1363\n01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,310\nThey can all be set,\nthrough a group policy, so\n\n1364\n01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:58,970\nthat you may not have the option to\nchoose what is a default for what.\n\n1365\n01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:01,650\nIt could be chosen for you, in some cases.\n\n1366\n01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:04,300\n>> And you'll see,\nwe've said it several times in this show.\n\n1367\n01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,750\nIf you've got a thousand computers out\nthere, you don't wanna have to go and\n\n1368\n01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,140\nrun this control panel\non a thousand machines.\n\n1369\n01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,290\nSo you can write a policy\nthat pushes it out and\n\n1370\n01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:15,550\ngets it set consistent\nacross your environment.\n\n1371\n01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:18,854\n>> So we'll talk about policy stuff,\nend a show, and wrap it up all at once.\n\n1372\n01:08:18,854 --> 01:08:24,970\nBut there's many, many, many, many, many\nsettings in there to configure Windows and\n\n1373\n01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:28,490\ndo it one way, and\ndo it to a whole bunch of machines.\n\n1374\n01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:29,410\nImportant stuff.\n\n1375\n01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:30,230\nWe'll cover it.\n\n1376\n01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:30,730\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1377\n01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,350\nAll right.\n\n1378\n01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:36,910\nNow the last thing that we have on\ninstalling traditional apps is kind\n\n1379\n01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,030\nof a weird one.\n\n1380\n01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,880\nIt's one that Microsoft throws\ninto the objectives because they\n\n1381\n01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,810\nwant you to be aware of.\n\n1382\n01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,903\nThey don't expect you to know\nhow to do it or configure it,\n\n1383\n01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,201\nthey just want you to be aware of it.\n\n1384\n01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:50,240\nIt's a program, or a suite of programs,\ncalled Microsoft App V.\n\n1385\n01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,493\nAnd App V is a neat program that\nMicrosoft, they didn't actually make it,\n\n1386\n01:08:54,493 --> 01:08:57,277\nthey acquired a company\nthat made this product.\n\n1387\n01:08:57,277 --> 01:09:00,833\nIt was a neat one that allowed\nyou to basically quickly and\n\n1388\n01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:05,207\neasily distribute applications out\nto a large quantity of machines,\n\n1389\n01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:08,060\nthat I could have 1000 computers.\n\n1390\n01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:12,920\nAnd I could package up an application, and\nhave it available, running from a server.\n\n1391\n01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,780\nSo when you're in your office or whatever,\n\n1392\n01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,710\nyou're actually running this\napplication from the server.\n\n1393\n01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,910\nBut when you leave the building,\n\n1394\n01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,610\nyou can take an offline version\nof that application with you.\n\n1395\n01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:25,780\nSo you can continue to run the application\nwhile you're out in the field.\n\n1396\n01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:27,380\nThen you come back to the office, and\n\n1397\n01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:30,240\nyour changes in data synchronizes\nback up in your system.\n\n1398\n01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:35,760\nIt's a really neat, really cool\ntechnology, that is insanely complex.\n\n1399\n01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,090\nIt is not something that\nyou install in a day.\n\n1400\n01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,230\nIt's something that takes weeks, months,\n\n1401\n01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:42,650\nyears to plan and\ndeploy in an environment.\n\n1402\n01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:46,380\nVery powerful software geared\ntowards enterprise businesses.\n\n1403\n01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:47,420\nNot medium and large.\n\n1404\n01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,010\nI'm talking enterprise.\n\n1405\n01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,530\nThe big guys.\n\n1406\n01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:55,338\n>> Yep, now you know Don, I just wanna\nlet you know, I put together this really\n\n1407\n01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:58,964\nsweet, cool App-V demo, and\nwe are gonna do it in here.\n\n1408\n01:09:58,964 --> 01:10:02,023\nAnd I was gonna push out\nan application to your computer,\n\n1409\n01:10:02,023 --> 01:10:05,070\nof all these really sweet games and\neverything.\n\n1410\n01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:09,360\nBut, in all this stuff I\nhad this big meltdown and\n\n1411\n01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,530\nthings would disappear and didn't work and\nit was real, real frustrating.\n\n1412\n01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:18,420\nSo, I just wanted to let you\nknow my intentions were,\n\n1413\n01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,947\nthat we would actually look at it.\n\n1414\n01:10:19,947 --> 01:10:22,470\n>> And for those of you at home,\nyou're probably thinking,\n\n1415\n01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:26,000\nboy, that would have been cool,\nbecause it would have.\n\n1416\n01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,560\nAnd boy,\n\n1417\n01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,550\nNate must be a knucklehead if he couldn't\nget it to work, but it's not Nate's fault.\n\n1418\n01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:35,990\nI have seen production\ndeployments that have invested\n\n1419\n01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:40,700\nhundreds of thousands of dollars\ninto App V completely fail.\n\n1420\n01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:43,400\nIt is a seriously complex technology.\n\n1421\n01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,290\nMost of the people that do App V\ndeployments actually bring in Microsoft\n\n1422\n01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:51,290\nconsultants, and I don't mean\nthird-party consultants from Bob and\n\n1423\n01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,880\nTom's consulting agency.\n\n1424\n01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,100\nI mean the guys that actually come from\nMicrosoft headquarters in Redmond come out\n\n1425\n01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,890\nand set it up, and I've seen those\ndeployments completely fail.\n\n1426\n01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:03,070\nSo it is a complex technology.\n\n1427\n01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:07,670\nOnce you get it set up though,\nonce everything is sequenced and in place.\n\n1428\n01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,830\nIt's actually really super cool, right?\n\n1429\n01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:12,570\nBut you have to be ready to put\nin that time and money into it.\n\n1430\n01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:14,120\nIt's a high dollar item.\n\n1431\n01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:18,687\nYou know the second Windows 8 thing.\n\n1432\n01:11:18,687 --> 01:11:22,104\nIt covers App V in depth.\n\n1433\n01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:25,080\nI mean you actually set it up and\nconfigure stuff.\n\n1434\n01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,625\nSo I'll get it ready for next time.\n\n1435\n01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:32,333\n>> For the 72, 70-688.\n\n1436\n01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:33,292\nI gotta get my exam numbers right.\n\n1437\n01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:35,333\n76, 88 exam.\n\n1438\n01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:39,317\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen, it\nlooks like we are right up on break time\n\n1439\n01:11:39,317 --> 01:11:41,880\nagain, right, or did we not set the timer?\n\n1440\n01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,760\n>> Yeah, I don't think it got set.\n\n1441\n01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,640\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n1442\n01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,970\n>> I got, my timers are off.\n\n1443\n01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:48,070\nAll right, well let's do this then.\n\n1444\n01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:52,270\nLet's take a quick break here,\nand when we get back,\n\n1445\n01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:56,970\nwe will jump into the cool stuff,\nwhich is the Metro or Modern UI,\n\n1446\n01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:00,160\nthe new interface, and the new store, and\nthe new apps that we have in Windows 8,\n\n1447\n01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,390\nand get a chance to see those, and\njump into all that good stuff.\n\n1448\n01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:07,091\nSo stay tuned, and\nwe'll be back in a few minutes.\n\n1449\n01:12:07,091 --> 01:12:10,976\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1450\n01:12:10,976 --> 01:12:16,675\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1451\n01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:21,050\nSo before the break we have tackled\njust a ton of stuff, right.\n\n1452\n01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,640\nInstalling applications,\nall sorts of different ways.\n\n1453\n01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:27,980\nBut now we get the fun, the new,\nthe cutting edge of technology.\n\n1454\n01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,720\nThe Windows 8 app store.\n\n1455\n01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,190\nWhich is not the official name for it.\n\n1456\n01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:32,890\nWhat the heck is it?\n\n1457\n01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,200\nIt's called a Windows store, right?\n\n1458\n01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,780\n>> Straight up.\n\n1459\n01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,370\nYeah.\nWindows store.\n\n1460\n01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:39,820\n>> So, if you've heard of Windows 8,\nwhich I imagine you have,\n\n1461\n01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:42,940\nhaving at least watched a little\nbit of the show prior to now.\n\n1462\n01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:45,850\nThen, you're more than likely\nfamiliar with the new modern\n\n1463\n01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:48,550\nuser interface they introduced\nwith Windows 8, right?\n\n1464\n01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:52,060\nSo the modern UI, they called it\nthe Metro UI during development.\n\n1465\n01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:56,960\nBut basically it gives you\na tile based user interface for\n\n1466\n01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,820\nWindows 8, and\nthe applications that you download for\n\n1467\n01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,880\nthe modern UI operate within\nthis tiled realm right?\n\n1468\n01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,590\nSo, these tiles,\nthe ones that I have installed here,\n\n1469\n01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:12,610\nthese are just regular, not fancy tiles.\n\n1470\n01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:18,840\nSo I can see my Skydrive, my Google Maps,\nthat's not Google Maps it's Bing Maps.\n\n1471\n01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,680\nSo I can go in here and\nthese apps run a lot more like\n\n1472\n01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,630\nwhat you'd expect on a mobile device or\ntablet, something of that nature.\n\n1473\n01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:30,940\nThey run full screen and\nyou jump right in there,\n\n1474\n01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:36,490\nyeah here its trying to find me which\nit's pretty close to us, right?\n\n1475\n01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,920\nSo, anyhow.\n\n1476\n01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,755\nSo basically the apps run and they all run\nin a much more of like a mobile factor.\n\n1477\n01:13:42,755 --> 01:13:45,840\nNow these tiles,\nthey can come in different sizes.\n\n1478\n01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,260\nYou'll see like this is wide one here,\nwe got thin ones.\n\n1479\n01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,350\nAnd then there's what\nare called live tiles.\n\n1480\n01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:54,650\nAnd live tiles are ones that actually\ndynamically show information on\n\n1481\n01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:55,190\nthe screen.\n\n1482\n01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,580\nSo you can actually see\nthings that are happening.\n\n1483\n01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,560\nAnd I don't have any live tiles but,\nNate, do you?\n\n1484\n01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,623\n>> What happened to all your live tiles?\n\n1485\n01:14:01,623 --> 01:14:03,492\n>> I like mine clean, I deleted them all.\n\n1486\n01:14:03,492 --> 01:14:04,072\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1487\n01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:06,710\n>> Well, I mean, but\nlike demo your computer.\n\n1488\n01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:11,020\nWouldn't you want to have\nthe core Windows 8 experience?\n\n1489\n01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,130\nI mean if you gonna be using it?\n\n1490\n01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:16,122\nThat's what I thought, Don,\nthat's why I didn't install chrome,\n\n1491\n01:14:16,122 --> 01:14:16,880\nI use Internet explorer.\n\n1492\n01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,920\n>> Oh, well you definitely could do that.\n\n1493\n01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,360\nI just don't like a bunch of junk on\nmy system so I just deleted it all.\n\n1494\n01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,690\nI shouldn't say junk, technology.\n\n1495\n01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,000\nRight?\nI like to minimize\n\n1496\n01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,480\nthe technology I'm exposed to.\n\n1497\n01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,240\nSo anyhow,\nlet's jump over to your machine,\n\n1498\n01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:31,770\nbecause you do have some live tiles.\n\n1499\n01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,240\nOh, we're already there.\n\n1500\n01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,380\nSo you wanted to give the tour.\n\n1501\n01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,680\n>> So, yeah we've got, so\nhere are my tiles that I have on mine.\n\n1502\n01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,040\nAnd there's some live ones,\nlike the weather app.\n\n1503\n01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,730\nIt cycles through weather and\nit shows things.\n\n1504\n01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:50,290\nWe've got a stocks app and\nsome other things.\n\n1505\n01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:55,590\nNow these tiles, they're built in, except\nthe Hewlett-Packard one, that one's extra.\n\n1506\n01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,580\nThey're built into Windows.\n\n1507\n01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:01,410\nNow some apps that you download\nfrom the Windows store will have\n\n1508\n01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:05,710\nlive tiles like these,\nwith dynamically updating content.\n\n1509\n01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,560\nOther titles will be just kind of dead.\n\n1510\n01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,660\nIt'll just sit there and be a clicky icon.\n\n1511\n01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:13,380\n>> I installed the new\nMinesweeper on mine, right.\n\n1512\n01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,620\nHave you played the new Minesweeper?\n\n1513\n01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:16,140\n>> One time.\n\n1514\n01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:19,340\n>> They did a whole graphical overall,\nit's actually pretty awesome.\n\n1515\n01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:23,750\nAnd, the live tile for it,\nafter I beat the medium level,\n\n1516\n01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:26,570\nthe live tile switch said,\nyou're ready for the hard level.\n\n1517\n01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:29,100\nAnd so it's actually kind of keeping\nup to date on what's going on\n\n1518\n01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,270\ninside of that app.\n\n1519\n01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:32,150\nNot everybody supports that yet, but\n\n1520\n01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:34,700\nmany developers are starting\nto put it in there.\n\n1521\n01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,710\nThe Netflix icon or\n\n1522\n01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:39,300\nwhatever, will cycle through some\nof the new releases that are out.\n\n1523\n01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,490\nAnd so\nyou see some really kind of cool things.\n\n1524\n01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:46,060\nAnd this is all part of that new\nuser interface, the modern UI.\n\n1525\n01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:48,685\nNow, when we install these apps.\n\n1526\n01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:51,750\nIt's a different world from\nall of our traditional apps.\n\n1527\n01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:56,530\nInstead of having an MSI file or\nan EXE that we run, if you want to install\n\n1528\n01:15:56,530 --> 01:16:01,570\na modern user-interface app,\nyou have to go into the windows store.\n\n1529\n01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:06,350\nSo, lets jump back to my computer here and\nI'll kind of take you through this.\n\n1530\n01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:10,070\nSo, if I go into the Windows store,\nI can jump right in and\n\n1531\n01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,730\nI see all the various\ncategories that are out there.\n\n1532\n01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:13,390\nSo I've got the,\n\n1533\n01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:16,750\nthe Microsoft spotlight, those\nare the apps they are recommending today.\n\n1534\n01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:19,120\nI can see their games and so on.\n\n1535\n01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,390\nAnd I can browse based on the top paid or\ntop free or whatever.\n\n1536\n01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:28,590\nI can go in and find a free game,\nso I can find a game that I want,\n\n1537\n01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:31,700\nand actually where is minesweeper\nsince I talked about it.\n\n1538\n01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:35,330\nI guess I should search\n>> Well this will bring a good topic,\n\n1539\n01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,800\non how to search.\n\n1540\n01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,160\nSearch the Windows store, right.\n\n1541\n01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:45,720\nSo you have a charms bar and\nthat's off to the side there.\n\n1542\n01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,220\nAnd there's a search, right.\n\n1543\n01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,240\nAnd you can type in right there.\n\n1544\n01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,340\nMinesweeper.\n\n1545\n01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,390\n>> Which I think is all one word.\n\n1546\n01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:56,110\nAnd notice over here I choose where\nI'm searching and so I've got.\n\n1547\n01:16:56,110 --> 01:17:01,370\nStore chosen, so it knows to search the\nstore and so when we search it, it finds\n\n1548\n01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:05,110\nvarious things and there it is Microsoft\nminesweeper and we can choose it.\n\n1549\n01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:08,870\nNow, to install some apps are pay apps and\nso\n\n1550\n01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:12,700\nI'd have to put in a credit card and\nthen pay, others are free like this one.\n\n1551\n01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:18,110\nOh it does want my Microsoft account,\nso all right well.\n\n1552\n01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:24,320\n>> That's a good example there to\ninstall stuff in the windows store.\n\n1553\n01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,430\nYou have to have a Microsoft\naccount which is all free.\n\n1554\n01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:32,820\nIf you have a local account on\nWindows 8 when we installed it,\n\n1555\n01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,440\nwe showed that in the installing one.\n\n1556\n01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,140\nTo download stuff from the Windows\nstore you have to sign in using\n\n1557\n01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:38,809\na Microsoft account.\n\n1558\n01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:43,910\n>> So on a negative side,\nyou do have to have a Microsoft account,\n\n1559\n01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,630\non a positive side,\nyou have a Microsoft account.\n\n1560\n01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:50,110\nSo it does link up to things like\nXbox live, so you guys can go and\n\n1561\n01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:54,710\nsee my wicked sweet minesweeper scores and\ncompete against me\n\n1562\n01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:58,510\nI'll just tell you know, just give up\nbecause I'm so amazing at Minesweeper.\n\n1563\n01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,470\n>> I'm going to install it now.\n\n1564\n01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:03,330\n>> I know they'll beat me within a day.\n\n1565\n01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:08,220\nAnyhow it is kind of neat, the install's,\nI don't know about you Nate but\n\n1566\n01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,920\nmy experience, kind of slow.\n\n1567\n01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,390\nSo we can see right here,\nit has downloaded it.\n\n1568\n01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,450\nIt's fully downloaded at this point.\n\n1569\n01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,560\nAnd now it's installing it,\nand it just sits there and\n\n1570\n01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,400\nit says pending, and\nit's kind of frustrating.\n\n1571\n01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,490\nBut it is actually installing,\nit just takes it a little bit.\n\n1572\n01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,800\nAnd when this app installs,\n\n1573\n01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,660\nthe icon will automatically be\nadded to my modern user interface.\n\n1574\n01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:31,100\nIt'll be right there on the start screen,\nand I'll be able to click it, run it, and\n\n1575\n01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,960\nlife will be good\n>> Now, all right so let's say the apps\n\n1576\n01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:41,020\nthat you've downloaded, like Minesweeper,\nwhen it does come time to update the apps\n\n1577\n01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:46,400\nlike the desktop apps, you update those a\ncertain way and the Windows 8 modern style\n\n1578\n01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,768\napps get updated through the Windows store\n>> Yeah,\n\n1579\n01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:52,290\nin my opinion the single\nbest feature of this, right?\n\n1580\n01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:55,670\nBecause, traditional desk top apps,\nyou had to go and update yourself.\n\n1581\n01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,501\nSo if a new version of QuickBooks\ncame out you had to go into it,\n\n1582\n01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:01,920\ndownload QuickBooks,\ndo the upgrade and often times pay.\n\n1583\n01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,880\nWith apps that we buy from\nthe Windows though store right?\n\n1584\n01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,080\nWe come into the Windows store,\nand see my little note up here?\n\n1585\n01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,680\nUpdates eleven.\n\n1586\n01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,990\nEleven of the programs that I have\ninstalled have updates right now.\n\n1587\n01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:17,160\nAnd all I have to do is click on that and\nit will show me the updates\n\n1588\n01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,885\nthat are available and\noh thank goodness, the stock.\n\n1589\n01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:20,517\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n1590\n01:19:20,517 --> 01:19:23,458\nthese programs are being updated,\nthis is all stock stuff.\n\n1591\n01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:26,000\nBut basically you check off\nthe ones that you want to update.\n\n1592\n01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,458\nThey're all checked by default.\n\n1593\n01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,043\nAnd then you just click install.\n\n1594\n01:19:29,043 --> 01:19:31,878\nAnd now, it's gonna go and\nit's gonna update all those apps.\n\n1595\n01:19:31,878 --> 01:19:32,592\nRight.\nSo,\n\n1596\n01:19:32,592 --> 01:19:36,630\nit's still pending on my Minesweeper\ninstall, which is slightly frustrating.\n\n1597\n01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:39,370\nBut then, all of the other ones,\nwell they're pending too.\n\n1598\n01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:42,230\nSo I've just got one great\nbig pending deployment.\n\n1599\n01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,625\nBut it's going to do that update, and\nthen all the apps are nice and up to date.\n\n1600\n01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:47,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1601\n01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:47,830\nNice.\nAll right.\n\n1602\n01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:48,350\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1603\n01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,540\nThere's my Minesweeper.\n\n1604\n01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:51,120\n>> Oh yeah, there it is.\n\n1605\n01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,220\n>> Oh, nope.\nIt says that it's still installing.\n\n1606\n01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,205\nSee?\nIt's hard to see, but it says pending.\n\n1607\n01:19:55,205 --> 01:19:55,753\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1608\n01:19:55,753 --> 01:19:56,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sweet.\n\n1609\n01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,770\nAll right, well yeah.\n\n1610\n01:19:58,770 --> 01:19:59,790\nSo there we go.\n\n1611\n01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:04,130\nThese are the apps included\nin the Windows store.\n\n1612\n01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:07,320\nNow, let's say we have\na line of business app.\n\n1613\n01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,550\nThat you don't want to publish or you\ncan publish to the Windows store, right?\n\n1614\n01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:16,540\nYou can still install apps that you\ndon't have to go through the store.\n\n1615\n01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:20,660\n>> So if it's a private app, something\nthat you designed for your company, right?\n\n1616\n01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:23,350\nSomething we wrote for\ninternal use not for general consumption,\n\n1617\n01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:25,633\nyou are not gonna list\nthat in the Windows Store.\n\n1618\n01:20:25,633 --> 01:20:26,336\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1619\n01:20:26,336 --> 01:20:26,930\nYep.\nSo,\n\n1620\n01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:31,461\nthat brings up our last\nsubobjective called side loading.\n\n1621\n01:20:31,461 --> 01:20:31,990\nRight?\n\n1622\n01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:39,010\nSide loading, it's a, I'm not sure\nthe generic way of saying just install\n\n1623\n01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:43,756\nthings the non-default way, but it's-\n>> That's about right.\n\n1624\n01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:44,570\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1625\n01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:50,560\nI have an example here\nwe can take a look at.\n\n1626\n01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,020\nA Windows Store app that I whipped up.\n\n1627\n01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,830\nIt's a little template, and so\n\n1628\n01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:59,870\nwe are gonna to install the app\ngoing not through the Windows Store.\n\n1629\n01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,340\n>> All right.\n\n1630\n01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:05,260\nAnd there's several reasons,\nwe already gave a couple.\n\n1631\n01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,140\nBut the Windows App Store is also\nnot available in every country.\n\n1632\n01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:11,050\nAnd so if you have apps that you need to\npush, you may have to push them yourself.\n\n1633\n01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:14,360\nIt's not an easy thing, it's not\nsomething that a home user is gonna do.\n\n1634\n01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,409\nIt's really designed for businesses.\n\n1635\n01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:21,350\nSo Nate, you've got a sever set up and\nall that for it?\n\n1636\n01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,650\n>> Yep.\n>> Sweet.\n\n1637\n01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:25,150\n>> So\nthere's gonna be some requirements for\n\n1638\n01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:29,180\nside loading a Windows 8\nmonitor style app, right?\n\n1639\n01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:32,680\nIt has to be a Windows\n8 Enterprise computer.\n\n1640\n01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,890\nIt has to be joined to a domain.\n\n1641\n01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:41,300\n>> And there's a group policy setting\nthat allows apps to be side loaded,\n\n1642\n01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,680\nor installed.\n\n1643\n01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,790\nNow the apps have to be digitally signed,\nand\n\n1644\n01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:48,190\nthey have to be trusted by your computer.\n\n1645\n01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:50,010\n>> That's a lot of hoops.\n\n1646\n01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:53,370\n>> Yeah, it all sounds real great and\ngood and every thing.\n\n1647\n01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:58,597\nBut let's say you company has a lot\nof bring your own devices coming in.\n\n1648\n01:21:58,597 --> 01:22:02,040\nRight?\nUsers bringing their laptops in from out\n\n1649\n01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:02,710\nof the company.\n\n1650\n01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:06,270\nYou don't want, or\ndon't need to join them to a domain.\n\n1651\n01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:07,970\nYou can still side load apps.\n\n1652\n01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:13,605\nThere's a Windows side\nloading product key, and\n\n1653\n01:22:13,605 --> 01:22:19,875\nthat it can be used to allow apps to\nbe signed or installed on the computer.\n\n1654\n01:22:19,875 --> 01:22:23,015\nBut we're gonna do the more I guess,\n\n1655\n01:22:23,015 --> 01:22:28,098\nthe way that most people go through and\nI domain in, right?\n\n1656\n01:22:28,098 --> 01:22:29,613\n>> All right, fire it up.\n>> All right.\n\n1657\n01:22:29,613 --> 01:22:34,080\nSo I got a couple of virtual\nmachines here, right?\n\n1658\n01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:39,142\nSo I got a client machine here and I have.\n\n1659\n01:22:39,142 --> 01:22:45,180\nThat's right, ha ha.\n\n1660\n01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,260\nAll right,\nnow I've got a server sitting over here.\n\n1661\n01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:48,590\nAll right.\n\n1662\n01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:51,480\nSo the first thing that we're\ngoing to do is we're going to\n\n1663\n01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,950\nturn on the policy setting that\nwill let us install the apps.\n\n1664\n01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:56,800\nRight?\n\n1665\n01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,653\nAnd there is a tool in here,\nusers and computes.\n\n1666\n01:23:03,193 --> 01:23:05,596\nActually, sorry, it's not through here.\n\n1667\n01:23:05,596 --> 01:23:09,870\n>> [LAUGH] Don,\nyou've worked this kind of stuff.\n\n1668\n01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:12,140\nYou wanna dictate while I\nclick through these menus?\n\n1669\n01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:13,515\n>> Yeah.\nYou're gonna do a group policy?\n\n1670\n01:23:13,515 --> 01:23:14,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1671\n01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:16,080\n>> So you need to go into\nthe group policy management.\n\n1672\n01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,560\nAnd a group policy,\nif you've never seen one before,\n\n1673\n01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,470\nit's a place where if you've\ngot an active directory domain.\n\n1674\n01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:25,640\nIf you've got all of your computers linked\ntogether via centralized server system,\n\n1675\n01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,580\nyou can go into your domain and\nyou can create policy entries.\n\n1676\n01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:32,850\nA definition of settings that\nare available for your systems.\n\n1677\n01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:36,390\nOnce you define those settings once,\nyou can then apply\n\n1678\n01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:39,720\nthose policies out to all the machines\nthroughout your organization.\n\n1679\n01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:44,560\nSo, if Nate wants to side load this\napp into 1000 Windows 8 machines,\n\n1680\n01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,075\nhe writes the policy once.\n\n1681\n01:23:46,075 --> 01:23:49,700\nIt gets it set up, and then is able to\npush that app out to all those machines\n\n1682\n01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,930\nwithout going out and\nhaving to physically touching them.\n\n1683\n01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:57,950\nSo that is the key component in\ngetting something like that in place.\n\n1684\n01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:58,812\n>> Yep. Thanks, Don. >> Yep.\n\n1685\n01:23:58,812 --> 01:23:59,529\n>> All right.\nSo,\n\n1686\n01:23:59,529 --> 01:24:04,428\nwe're gonna go near Computer Configuration\n> Policies > Administrative >\n\n1687\n01:24:04,428 --> 01:24:09,713\nTemplates > Wndows > Components, and\nthen there's the guy right there, right?\n\n1688\n01:24:09,713 --> 01:24:11,910\nApp Package Deployment.\n\n1689\n01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:14,413\nAnd here's the policy right\nhere we are going to modify.\n\n1690\n01:24:14,413 --> 01:24:17,738\nAnd we are going to\nchange this to enabled.\n\n1691\n01:24:17,738 --> 01:24:20,542\nApply, OK.\n\n1692\n01:24:20,542 --> 01:24:22,850\nAll right.\n\n1693\n01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,670\nThere we go, now it's enabled.\n\n1694\n01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:31,290\nSecond part, so we'll jump over to\nour client, and that is this guy.\n\n1695\n01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,250\nAll right.\nSo now,\n\n1696\n01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,510\nwhat we'll do is we'll update our policy.\n\n1697\n01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:35,153\nRight?\nSo he's got that.\n\n1698\n01:24:42,824 --> 01:24:44,548\n>> And so\nthe command that Nate's running right now,\n\n1699\n01:24:44,548 --> 01:24:47,045\nit's just gonna reach out there and\nmake that policy download and apply.\n\n1700\n01:24:47,045 --> 01:24:49,695\nSo the setting that's he put,\nthat enabled side loading,\n\n1701\n01:24:49,695 --> 01:24:52,030\nis now gonna take effect\nright here on this machine.\n\n1702\n01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,170\n>> All right.\n\n1703\n01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:57,120\nSo while that guys going, right?\n\n1704\n01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,640\nSo here a app 3 folder, right?\n\n1705\n01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,350\nSo here is our side loaded app.\n\n1706\n01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:06,290\nSo now other requirements, right?\n\n1707\n01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:10,140\nSo we have to allow untrusted\napps to be installed.\n\n1708\n01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,248\nWe also have to trust the apps.\n\n1709\n01:25:12,248 --> 01:25:16,960\nNow generally, a developer will\nassign it with a certificate\n\n1710\n01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,120\nthat's going to be chained to\na trusted root certificate.\n\n1711\n01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,540\nBut we're going to go at\nit a little different way.\n\n1712\n01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,778\nSo here's your certificate here.\n\n1713\n01:25:26,778 --> 01:25:27,420\nRight?\n\n1714\n01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,740\nIt is not trusted, but we will install it.\n\n1715\n01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:33,690\n>> So this isn't something you\nwould normally have to do.\n\n1716\n01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:37,940\nWhat Nate's doing is bypassing some of the\nsecurity requirements that Microsoft has.\n\n1717\n01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:42,840\nSo by loading this false certificate in,\nhe can have an application that is signed\n\n1718\n01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,100\nwith the false certificate and\ndeployed within the system.\n\n1719\n01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:45,828\nSo that's what he's doing right here.\n\n1720\n01:25:49,794 --> 01:25:53,428\n>> [COUGH] We'll give it a minute,\nit should pop up.\n\n1721\n01:25:55,858 --> 01:25:57,506\nIt said it was imported successfully.\n\n1722\n01:25:57,506 --> 01:25:59,494\nThere it goes.\n\n1723\n01:25:59,494 --> 01:26:00,349\n>> Yep.\n>> All right.\n\n1724\n01:26:00,349 --> 01:26:03,850\nAnd then just to double\ncheck that it took.\n\n1725\n01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:06,770\nThere we go, certificate path,\nthis certificate is okay.\n\n1726\n01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:08,200\nAll right, sweet.\n\n1727\n01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,370\nSo we have it trusted.\n\n1728\n01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:14,722\nAnd yeah, so now,\nit's time to install the thing.\n\n1729\n01:26:14,722 --> 01:26:15,700\nAll right.\n\n1730\n01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,870\nSo at our command prompt, right?\n\n1731\n01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:22,180\nSo we need to use PowerShell to do it.\n\n1732\n01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:28,440\nAnd we'll do it-\n>> And Windows PowerShell,\n\n1733\n01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,110\nthat's the more advanced command line\ninterface that Microsoft introduced.\n\n1734\n01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:33,710\nThey introduced it with\nWindows Server 2003.\n\n1735\n01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,290\nIt's been hanging around for\na while now, and\n\n1736\n01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:39,460\nit gives you some advanced controls and\ncommands that you can use.\n\n1737\n01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:43,547\nSo he's dropping into that because it's\nthe only choice to be able to do the side\n\n1738\n01:26:43,547 --> 01:26:44,645\nloading of the apps.\n\n1739\n01:26:49,332 --> 01:26:50,458\n>> All right.\n\n1740\n01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,655\nAll right.\nSo there we go.\n\n1741\n01:27:02,655 --> 01:27:04,365\nSo we got that stuff.\n\n1742\n01:27:04,365 --> 01:27:10,555\nNow for PowerShell, there is a module\nthat we have to import in there, right?\n\n1743\n01:27:10,555 --> 01:27:14,947\nSo its import\n\n1744\n01:27:14,947 --> 01:27:19,742\nmodule appx.\n\n1745\n01:27:19,742 --> 01:27:20,333\nAll right,here we go.\n\n1746\n01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:24,418\nSo once we've got that imported in there,\n\n1747\n01:27:24,418 --> 01:27:30,667\nit is You know that it just totally\nmust be where that command was.\n\n1748\n01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:31,750\nTo bring that in.\n\n1749\n01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:32,270\nTo install it.\n\n1750\n01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,390\nDo you remember what it was, Don?\n\n1751\n01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,810\n>> Oh, to actually initiate cuz I live.\n\n1752\n01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:36,310\n>> Import.\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1753\n01:27:36,310 --> 01:27:37,829\n>> The site alone I do not.\n\n1754\n01:27:39,568 --> 01:27:42,170\nHang on a second.\nI'll see if I can find it real quick.\n\n1755\n01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:43,900\n>> On the notes.\n\n1756\n01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:44,580\nOh it's in the notes.\n\n1757\n01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:48,880\nI've got my notes, no actually I\ndon't have the notes for that.\n\n1758\n01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,050\nIt got cut off.\n\n1759\n01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:55,035\n>> Oh yeah\n>> Hang on let me see, maybe it's here.\n\n1760\n01:27:55,035 --> 01:28:04,270\nUh-huh There's so much stuff in here.\n\n1761\n01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:04,870\n>> I know that they.\n\n1762\n01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:07,220\n>> Yeah, the heat of the moment,\nthe lights, the cameras.\n\n1763\n01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:08,690\n>> I know.\n\n1764\n01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,710\nIt is not in the notes, Nate.\n\n1765\n01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:11,150\nOr at least not in\nthe notes that I've got.\n\n1766\n01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:12,370\n>> Oh yeah?\n\n1767\n01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,670\n>> See, it ends,\nlike this sentence gets interrupted, so\n\n1768\n01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:17,395\nlike the full set of notes\ndidn't get pushed in.\n\n1769\n01:28:17,395 --> 01:28:22,069\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh goodness.\n\n1770\n01:28:25,151 --> 01:28:27,090\nAll right, add AppEx.\n\n1771\n01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:28,090\n>> Package.\n\n1772\n01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:28,590\n>> There you go.\n\n1773\n01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,278\nThat's what I was going to say.\n\n1774\n01:28:32,278 --> 01:28:33,977\n>> Mm-hm [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n1775\n01:28:33,977 --> 01:28:35,660\n>> [LAUGH] okay continuing on.\n\n1776\n01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:39,875\nAdd AppEx package, and\n\n1777\n01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:46,090\nthen the path to our package.\n\n1778\n01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:50,340\nAnd I copied it earlier so\nwe'll just drop that right in there.\n\n1779\n01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,204\nAnd then, all right,\n\n1780\n01:28:53,204 --> 01:28:57,527\nit's this big long name so\nI'll just kind of drag take that up there.\n\n1781\n01:29:06,276 --> 01:29:06,813\n>> Yeah, and\n\n1782\n01:29:06,813 --> 01:29:11,068\nyour powershells being covered up by your\n>> Picture there Nate, all right.\n\n1783\n01:29:15,693 --> 01:29:23,430\n>> I'll get this thing typed in and then\n[LAUGH] I'll joining you back up there.\n\n1784\n01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:27,195\n>> So if this seems difficult, it is, but\nit's all designed to be command lined so\n\n1785\n01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,245\nit can be automated.\n\n1786\n01:29:28,245 --> 01:29:28,860\n[INAUDIBLE] Right?\nSo\n\n1787\n01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,090\nif you're an administrator\npushing this out over a network,\n\n1788\n01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:32,390\nit's gotta be done via the command line.\n\n1789\n01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:35,090\nIt's the only way you can silently\ndo things in the background.\n\n1790\n01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:37,070\nSo, basically AppEx.\n\n1791\n01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:41,480\nThat's the subsystem inside of the power\nshell that allows us to manage the Windows\n\n1792\n01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,130\nstore applications.\n\n1793\n01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:45,700\nAnd then, when he does, add AppEx package.\n\n1794\n01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,540\n>> That's bringing that package in,\nand installing it.\n\n1795\n01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,150\nNormally, the windows store would do that,\nbut\n\n1796\n01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:54,320\nin this case, this isn't\nan application that's in the store.\n\n1797\n01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,580\nAnd so,\nwe're having to do it manually, and\n\n1798\n01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,750\nthat's basically what\nhe's doing right here.\n\n1799\n01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,880\nAssuming you can spell\nthe file name right.\n\n1800\n01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,632\n>> Yeah, I know, I gotta check all that\n[LAUGH] all right so there we go, so\n\n1801\n01:30:05,632 --> 01:30:09,680\nthe add AppEx package and\nour big long file name and our app.\n\n1802\n01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:17,320\nWe'll smash enter, it's gonna pull it up,\nit's gonna check all the conditions,\n\n1803\n01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:22,440\nmake sure everything is all set and\nit looks good, and\n\n1804\n01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,340\nyeah, if I have done everything right, so\n\n1805\n01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:29,080\nnow it should appear in the installed\napps and look and there it is.\n\n1806\n01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:33,300\nThere's our app the IT pro TV, Mm-hm.\n\n1807\n01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,952\n>> Coming not to a Windows Store near you.\n\n1808\n01:30:35,952 --> 01:30:37,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n1809\n01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:40,300\nbasically we've now installed an app and\nit's much more difficult\n\n1810\n01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:44,060\nthan just going through the Windows Store,\nbut if you're a developer creating an app,\n\n1811\n01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:46,110\nif you're an admin rolling\nout an internal app.\n\n1812\n01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:48,950\nThis is something you'll do to\nbasically push that into a system.\n\n1813\n01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:52,740\nAnd get it there without going\nthrough the Windows Store.\n\n1814\n01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:53,490\n>> Mm-hm, Yup.\nSo yeah,\n\n1815\n01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:57,070\nthis was a pretty clunky way\nof going about doing it.\n\n1816\n01:30:57,070 --> 01:31:01,210\nNow in a typical environment, right,\nwouldn't have to import any certificates,\n\n1817\n01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:06,140\nwouldn't have to you know already\nset any policies or anything.\n\n1818\n01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,320\nAnd, yeah.\n\n1819\n01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,452\nYou know it typically,\nshould just be done for the user,\n\n1820\n01:31:10,452 --> 01:31:13,990\nthey just show up one day and\nthe app would be on the start screen.\n\n1821\n01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:17,280\nSo everything's, yeah,\ndone being the scenes.\n\n1822\n01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,148\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1823\n01:31:18,148 --> 01:31:22,540\nAnd you know keep in mind that this is the\nfirst release of the Windows Store, and\n\n1824\n01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:24,530\nWindows 8, and\nMicrosoft is constantly learning.\n\n1825\n01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:27,640\nSo they've already made improvements\nto the process with Windows 8.1.\n\n1826\n01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:31,370\nAnd as Windows continues to develop,\nit will get better and more refined.\n\n1827\n01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:35,210\nFor the exam, the things that\nyou need to remember, first off,\n\n1828\n01:31:35,210 --> 01:31:40,180\nis that by default you cannot side\nload apps in Windows 8 right?\n\n1829\n01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:41,810\nThat there is some stuff\nthat you have to do.\n\n1830\n01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:45,702\nYou have to adjust some policies you have\nto get your system ready for side loading.\n\n1831\n01:31:45,702 --> 01:31:50,200\nAll right and then second you can side\nload once you done that once you've jumped\n\n1832\n01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,740\nthrough those hoops you can push out what\n\n1833\n01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:57,310\nare really intended to be internal use\nonly apps Into Windows 8, all right?\n\n1834\n01:31:57,310 --> 01:31:59,860\nSo those are the key components you\nwant to remember from the exam.\n\n1835\n01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:02,380\nIf you learn in the process to deploy it,\nthat's great.\n\n1836\n01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:06,510\nThat part doesn't necessarily\nshow up on the exam, right?\n\n1837\n01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:09,825\nIt is considered testable material, but\nits not something they hit on very hard.\n\n1838\n01:32:09,825 --> 01:32:12,050\n>> Mm-hm yep, yep, yep.\n\n1839\n01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:17,090\nAnd it dawned,\ndid we talk about restricting Windows app?\n\n1840\n01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:18,090\n>> Uhh no.\n>> Storage contest.\n\n1841\n01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:20,645\n>> You know how we keep\nour kids out of trouble.\n\n1842\n01:32:20,645 --> 01:32:23,845\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah so, we'll just mention it here, so\n\n1843\n01:32:23,845 --> 01:32:27,596\nwe can restrict the things\nthat can be downloaded through\n\n1844\n01:32:27,596 --> 01:32:32,460\nthe Windows store through a Microsoft\nutility called, Hm, App locker.\n\n1845\n01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:39,360\n>> We won't get into App locker right now,\ncuz we cover it in another episode,\n\n1846\n01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:43,200\non restricting programs and\nthat sort of thing.\n\n1847\n01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,050\nBut yeah.\n\n1848\n01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:48,330\nSo, we can limit what is in the app store,\n\n1849\n01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:51,300\nor the Windows store on\nwhat can be downloaded.\n\n1850\n01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,490\nAnd you know, we've got a few minutes.\n\n1851\n01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:56,660\nLet's show them how to\ndisable the Windows Store.\n\n1852\n01:32:56,660 --> 01:32:57,280\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah,\n\n1853\n01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,910\nlet's use your computer as the guinea pig.\n\n1854\n01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:00,720\n>> All right.\nYou know what, Nate,\n\n1855\n01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,450\nI actually don't know how to do that.\n\n1856\n01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,650\nSo do you wanna walk me through it?\n\n1857\n01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:05,420\nHow do you disable the Windows Store?\n\n1858\n01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:06,985\n>> All right.\n\n1859\n01:33:06,985 --> 01:33:10,401\nSo, there is we can do it\non a local group policy.\n\n1860\n01:33:10,401 --> 01:33:15,985\nSo, then type in gpedit.msc.\n\n1861\n01:33:15,985 --> 01:33:17,443\n>> Oops.\n\n1862\n01:33:17,443 --> 01:33:19,901\n>> Hang on a second.\n\n1863\n01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:23,026\ngpedit.msc.\n\n1864\n01:33:23,026 --> 01:33:26,240\n>> All right, so\nthis will bring up our Local Group Policy.\n\n1865\n01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:31,045\n>> All right so\nin Computer Configuration, right,\n\n1866\n01:33:31,045 --> 01:33:36,280\nlet's click on Administrative Templates\nand Windows Components.\n\n1867\n01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:43,293\nAnd Mm-hm, let me look that up.\n\n1868\n01:33:43,293 --> 01:33:48,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No I just.I'm\n\n1869\n01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:53,880\n>> You don't\n\n1870\n01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,670\nremember where the option\n[INAUDIBLE] is do you?\n\n1871\n01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:58,190\nI was just making sure\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1872\n01:33:58,190 --> 01:33:59,390\n>> So actually lets go into\n\n1873\n01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:00,300\nuser configurations.\n\n1874\n01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,570\n>> So\nyou didn't even have me in the right stop.\n\n1875\n01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:08,862\n>> User configuration, administrative\ntemplates, Windows components, and store.\n\n1876\n01:34:11,776 --> 01:34:13,190\nThere we go.\n\n1877\n01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:16,450\nAnd there is the policy, we can\ndouble-click on that, pull it up, and\n\n1878\n01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:20,930\nthen click on enable to\nturn off the Windows store.\n\n1879\n01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,130\nWell I got started and\nas I was going through the things,\n\n1880\n01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:27,910\nit was to enable the policy\nto turn on the side load.\n\n1881\n01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:28,710\n>> Oh, funny.\n>> I was like oh wait,\n\n1882\n01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:29,340\nwait, wait a minute.\n\n1883\n01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,050\nThat's the side load one.\n\n1884\n01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:31,570\n>> Well, all right.\n\n1885\n01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:33,410\nLet's take a look at this.\n\n1886\n01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:36,220\nJason, switch back to my computer for\na minute.\n\n1887\n01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:39,750\nSo we went in here and I enabled\nthis option where it says turn off\n\n1888\n01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:42,500\nthe store application,\nit is set to enabled.\n\n1889\n01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:46,190\nI guess I have to do a policy refresh for\nthat to take effect, right?\n\n1890\n01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:49,130\nBecause under my start menu,\nI do still have the store, so let me.\n\n1891\n01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:53,945\nI probably need an administrative one.\n\n1892\n01:34:53,945 --> 01:34:54,579\nOops.\n\n1893\n01:34:54,579 --> 01:34:56,590\nAll right.\n\n1894\n01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:58,800\nSo I'm just gonna do a policy update.\n\n1895\n01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,430\nI'm gonna try and do a policy update.\n\n1896\n01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:05,260\nThere we go.\nAnd that should take effect and\n\n1897\n01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:08,180\nwhen it does,\nthe Windows Store should not be available.\n\n1898\n01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:11,180\nSo if, again,\nif you're in a corporate environment and\n\n1899\n01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,970\nyou don't want people to\nhave the Windows Store.\n\n1900\n01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:14,710\nYou don't want them to be able to go and\nbuy apps.\n\n1901\n01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:16,610\nstuff on their business computer.\n\n1902\n01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:19,620\nYou can just disable it outright,\nand the Windows store will remove.\n\n1903\n01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:22,193\nAnd I want to say you have to reboot, Hm.\n\n1904\n01:35:24,276 --> 01:35:25,168\nOh, look at that.\n\n1905\n01:35:25,168 --> 01:35:28,885\nWindows store isn't available on this PC,\ncontact your system administrator for\n\n1906\n01:35:28,885 --> 01:35:29,794\nmore information.\n\n1907\n01:35:29,794 --> 01:35:31,730\nIn other words,\n[LAUGH] go ask your administrator,\n\n1908\n01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,583\n[LAUGH] why you can't buy\nall these awesome apps.\n\n1909\n01:35:33,583 --> 01:35:34,626\nSo.\n\n1910\n01:35:34,626 --> 01:35:36,125\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1911\n01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:37,917\n>> Well Don, now let me ask you this.\n\n1912\n01:35:37,917 --> 01:35:41,290\nWhen would you want to turn\noff the Windows store?\n\n1913\n01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:43,370\nWe have the option to, we can.\n\n1914\n01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:47,770\nSo there's gotta be a reason\nwhy you'd want to turn it off.\n\n1915\n01:35:47,770 --> 01:35:49,860\n>> Well, I can think of a few.\n\n1916\n01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:54,558\nFrom a corporate perspective,\nlet's say I give you a company issued PC.\n\n1917\n01:35:54,558 --> 01:35:55,648\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1918\n01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,690\n>> And you log into the Windows store and\n\n1919\n01:35:57,690 --> 01:35:59,920\nyou start buying a bunch of\napps with your own money.\n\n1920\n01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,879\nAnd then, I fire you.\n\n1921\n01:36:00,879 --> 01:36:01,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n1922\n01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:03,270\nSo, you're fired.\n\n1923\n01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:08,100\nIt was a company computer, but\nyou spent your money in the app stores.\n\n1924\n01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,600\nYou might say,\nwell I spent all that money on the app.\n\n1925\n01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,930\nSo you guys need to refund me or\nI need to take my user account with me and\n\n1926\n01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:13,600\nwe might not want that.\n\n1927\n01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,462\nWe want control.\n\n1928\n01:36:14,462 --> 01:36:18,360\nWe wanna control the apps people\nhave access to and so on.\n\n1929\n01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:20,728\nSo we might choose to just\ndisable the store all together.\n\n1930\n01:36:20,728 --> 01:36:22,205\nRight?\n\n1931\n01:36:22,205 --> 01:36:27,070\nIf you have your kids using your computer,\nand you don't want the kids going into\n\n1932\n01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,670\nthe store and installing apps and\nthings like that.\n\n1933\n01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:30,860\nThen you might wanna disable it.\n\n1934\n01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:33,040\nSo there's a few reasons why you might.\n\n1935\n01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:36,100\nMaybe you just hate Windows 8, and\nyou wanna go back to the Windows 7 ways.\n\n1936\n01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:37,250\nYou say screw the store.\n\n1937\n01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,370\nI'm gonna disable it.\n\n1938\n01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:42,200\nIt's just, whatever,\nleads you down that path.\n\n1939\n01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,180\nThat's good, you brought up a company.\n\n1940\n01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:48,380\nWell, lets say with\nthe group policy stuff,\n\n1941\n01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:52,660\nwe can turn off the store apps for\ncertain groups or certain users.\n\n1942\n01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,651\nRight?\nLet's say sales department,\n\n1943\n01:36:54,651 --> 01:36:57,330\nyou can turn off the store for\nthe sales department.\n\n1944\n01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:57,948\nRight?\nBut\n\n1945\n01:36:57,948 --> 01:37:00,940\nthe IT guys they can\nstill keep their store.\n\n1946\n01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:03,191\nOr if you have a, Kiosk computer.\n\n1947\n01:37:03,191 --> 01:37:05,290\nRight?\nYou can turn the store off from a kiosk\n\n1948\n01:37:05,290 --> 01:37:10,200\ncomputer or some public use machine, so\nyou can dictate where it gets turned off.\n\n1949\n01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,672\n>> Couple different scenarios there.\n\n1950\n01:37:12,672 --> 01:37:14,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1951\n01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:19,630\nGoodness, I think that restricting\ncontent with App Blocker.\n\n1952\n01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:22,240\nWe'll get a little bit in-depth\nwith how App Blocker works.\n\n1953\n01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:24,860\nComputer policy there,\n\n1954\n01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:30,650\ngroup policy to just turn the thing\noff outright, siloed and stuff.\n\n1955\n01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:31,460\n>> Yeah.\nI think we've\n\n1956\n01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,286\ndone a pretty exhaustive\nreview of installing apps.\n\n1957\n01:37:34,286 --> 01:37:39,570\nNot really all that challenging\nin the general scheme of things.\n\n1958\n01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:40,620\nSome of it, I suppose.\n\n1959\n01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:42,940\nThe side loading is kind of complex.\n\n1960\n01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:46,270\nJust be aware that while most companies\n\n1961\n01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:48,555\naren't worried about all this just yet\nyet.\n\n1962\n01:37:48,555 --> 01:37:51,925\nOn the exam, Microsoft does love to\nstress the new technologies, and\n\n1963\n01:37:51,925 --> 01:37:54,005\nthe Windows Store is new technology.\n\n1964\n01:37:54,005 --> 01:37:57,675\nSo expect to see at least one question\non the Windows Store in there.\n\n1965\n01:37:57,675 --> 01:38:00,205\nEven though it might seem like\ninconsequential technology,\n\n1966\n01:38:00,205 --> 01:38:01,213\nit does show up on the exam.\n\n1967\n01:38:01,213 --> 01:38:02,715\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1968\n01:38:02,715 --> 01:38:03,470\nYep.\n\n1969\n01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:05,355\nWell, yeah, that's all I got.\n\n1970\n01:38:05,355 --> 01:38:07,915\n>> Yeah, I think I'm tapped out\ntoo as far as, there's only so\n\n1971\n01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:09,715\nmuch you can do on installing programs.\n\n1972\n01:38:09,715 --> 01:38:10,835\nSo let's do this.\n\n1973\n01:38:10,835 --> 01:38:12,085\nLet's wrap it up here.\n\n1974\n01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:16,700\nOur next Windows 8 show,\nwhat do we dive into next?\n\n1975\n01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,650\nWhat's next on our-\n>> Next, I think it\n\n1976\n01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:24,230\nis some of the App Blocker stuff, like\ncontrolling program access or something.\n\n1977\n01:38:24,230 --> 01:38:26,455\n>> Controlling access to local\nhardware and applications.\n\n1978\n01:38:26,455 --> 01:38:28,450\nYep.\nSo, we mentioned App Blocker a few times,\n\n1979\n01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,410\nwe'll definitely get into it there.\n\n1980\n01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:31,550\nWe'll get into a little more\nlocal policy stuff too.\n\n1981\n01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:33,930\nSo, good, fun things.\n\n1982\n01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:37,530\nDefinitely stay tuned for\nthat as we jump into those episodes.\n\n1983\n01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:41,410\nAnd as always, make sure you tune in for\nour other shows, like our Security Plus,\n\n1984\n01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:45,940\nNetwork Plus, and CCENT, the Cisco\nshows that are going on right now.\n\n1985\n01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:48,140\nAll good stuff to be found in them, too.\n\n1986\n01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:48,750\n>> Yep.\n\n1987\n01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:49,940\nThanks, Don.\n\n1988\n01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,870\n>> All right, well,\nthat's about it for us.\n\n1989\n01:38:51,870 --> 01:38:54,350\nSo as always,\nwe hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1990\n01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:57,360\nSigning off for ITProTV, I am Don Pezet.\n\n1991\n01:38:57,360 -->

and welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,350\n>> Whoo-hoo.\n\n6\n00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,770\nHi, I'm Nate Copeland,\nhere with Mike Rodrick\n\n7\n00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,040\n>> Hey howdy, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,700\n>> Doing well.\n\n9\n00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,460\n>> Good.\n>> Yep.\n\n10\n00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,890\nSo Don's not with us today.\n\n11\n00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,700\n>> I know, he's absent.\n\n12\n00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,770\n>> He's out on vacation doing something,\nrunning around town.\n\n13\n00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,930\n>> Probably something a lot more fun.\n\n14\n00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,210\n[LAUGH] What could be more fun than this,\nthough, right?\n\n15\n00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,939\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n16\n00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:00,274\nHopefully we don't get a call from\nthe police, needing to come pick him up or\n\n17\n00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:01,036\nsomething.\n\n18\n00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:02,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So Don, stay safe out there.\n\n19\n00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,559\nAll right, sweet, all right well,\ntoday what we have lined up,\n\n20\n00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:09,780\nwe've got-\n>> Good stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,595\n>> Yes, more good stuff.\n\n22\n00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:12,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n23\n00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,430\n>> More access to local hardware and\napplications and things,\n\n24\n00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,300\nso a continuation of\nwhat we've doing before.\n\n25\n00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,840\nNow specifically what we'll cover,\nwe've got configuring AppLocker,\n\n26\n00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,300\nwhich we talked about AppLocker\nin one of the earlier shows.\n\n27\n00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,470\nWe didn't really get into it\nsince we're doing that today.\n\n28\n00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,020\n>> Right.\n\n29\n00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,740\n>> We've got, you have configure\naccess through group policy,\n\n30\n00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,420\nlocal group policy, accessing to hardware.\n\n31\n00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,050\nAnd then we've got controlling or managing\ninstallation of removable devices,\n\n32\n00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,090\nwhich a removable device is like CDs.\n\n33\n00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,030\n>> Kind of a broad topic there.\n\n34\n00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,940\n>> Yeah, a lot of these are kind of broad.\n\n35\n00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,740\n>> They are, I like it.\n\n36\n00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,868\nI like it, I like me some AppLocker.\n\n37\n00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:58,263\nLet's do it.\n\n38\n00:01:58,263 --> 00:02:00,930\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Do you use AppLocker?\n\n39\n00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,240\n>> I do not.\n\n40\n00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,850\n>> You do not, no?\n\n41\n00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,380\n>> No.\n\n42\n00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,697\n>> I don't either.\n\n43\n00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:05,654\nI haven't used it either.\n\n44\n00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:09,260\n>> Yeah, used it, but never,\non my home network, no.\n\n45\n00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,600\nI'm the only one on my home network.\n\n46\n00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,860\nSo I really don't have\nanybody to block but\n\n47\n00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,210\nmyself, so not a lot of excitement there.\n\n48\n00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,565\nHere, we don't use it in our network,\nwe don't use it but\n\n49\n00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:22,300\nworked with some organizations that have.\n\n50\n00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,040\nSo it's good.\n\n51\n00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,670\n>> So yes, AppLocker, okay,\nwell, what is AppLocker?\n\n52\n00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,760\n>> Well, the whole idea behind\nAppLocker is that I really want to,\n\n53\n00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,590\nif you need to control what applications\nare allowed to run on your network.\n\n54\n00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,470\nRight, if we wanna prevent certain\napplications, like I don't want anybody\n\n55\n00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,464\ninstalling, dare I say World of Warcraft\nor iTunes on their work computer.\n\n56\n00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:42,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then we can use something like\n\n57\n00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,990\nAppLocker to prevent that,\n\n58\n00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,650\nas well as just to monitor what\napplications are being run.\n\n59\n00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,500\nAnd I like to make sure we have enough\nlicenses to cover our software, so\n\n60\n00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,860\na bunch of good uses for AppLocker.\n\n61\n00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,360\nBut the primary use is going to be\n\n62\n00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,240\nto control what applications\nare allowed to run on your network.\n\n63\n00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,846\n>> All right, yeah sweet.\n\n64\n00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:05,340\nSo all right,\nyeah we can control what runs and\n\n65\n00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,100\nwe can control what gets\nInstalled on there, right?\n\n66\n00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,440\nYeah.\n>> Well, not so much installed as run, but\n\n67\n00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,070\nyeah, it'll block it from running.\n\n68\n00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,590\n>> All right?\n\n69\n00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n70\n00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,639\n>> Word.\n>> Good stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now the one thing I will have to say\n\n72\n00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,430\nand you're gonna go into\na little demo here I believe.\n\n73\n00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,530\nYeah, one thing we do have to, as we get\nstarted, one thing we've got to remember\n\n74\n00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,220\nabout AppLocker is it works on\nan implicit deny or an implicit block.\n\n75\n00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,490\nMeaning that once we start AppLocker and\nwe start blocking applications, I've got\n\n76\n00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,780\nto make sure I allow other things,\nlike Windows, the operating system itself.\n\n77\n00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,460\nIt would be good to have access to that,\nand we'll see that.\n\n78\n00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,790\nWe'll create our default rules when we\ngo in there and create our first rule.\n\n79\n00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,936\n>> So, is it possible then to\nlock yourself out of a computer?\n\n80\n00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,730\n>> Yes it is.\n>> Right.\n\n81\n00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,290\n>> Because once you start that list,\n\n82\n00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,580\nonce you start blocking things, if it's\non the list, it's going to block it.\n\n83\n00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,820\nBut if it's not specifically listed as\nallowed, it will block that as well,\n\n84\n00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,505\nincluding the C colon Windows folder\nwhich is not really good to block.\n\n85\n00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:11,200\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, let's say someone is setting up\n\n86\n00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,134\nfor the first time and they do lock\nthemselves out, how do you get back?\n\n87\n00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:18,280\n>> Fortunately when you go through the,\nwhen you go into the group policy and\n\n88\n00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,180\nyou go to make that\nfirst AppLocker policy,\n\n89\n00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,720\nit's going to prompt you to create\nwhat they call the default rules.\n\n90\n00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,650\nThere's three rules in\nthere that it'll create and\n\n91\n00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,420\nthose rules allow Windows to function.\n\n92\n00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,410\nThere's one in there that's going to\nallow, oh gosh, if I can remember,\n\n93\n00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,570\nthe default users, or all users are going\nto be allowed access to SQL and Windows.\n\n94\n00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,600\nThe second rule that it's gonna create,\n\n95\n00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,080\nall users are allowed to run anything\nthat's already in SQL and program files.\n\n96\n00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,560\nAnd then the third default rule that it's\ngonna create says anybody in the local\n\n97\n00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,740\nadmins group gets a free pass.\n\n98\n00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,880\nSo, when you're creating that first rule,\n\n99\n00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,440\nas long as you just don't clickity click\nand ignore the messages that come up,\n\n100\n00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,640\nit's going to say, hey do you\nwant to create the default rules.\n\n101\n00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,011\nAnd yes, you most certainly do, right?\n\n102\n00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:05,179\n>> [LAUGH] So all right, AppLocker, so\n\n103\n00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,030\ngenerally it would be for\nEnterprise kind of stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,104\nSo like small businesses,\nlittle or even in the house, right?\n\n105\n00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:14,992\n>> Yes.\n>> So not so\n\n106\n00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:19,110\nmuch AppLocker, but\nbig Enterprise things that's where..\n\n107\n00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,350\n>> Yeah, it's an Enterprise feature.\n\n108\n00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,750\nSo it is gonna be on your Enterprise OS,\nso Windows 8 Enterprise.\n\n109\n00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,070\nNot gonna see it on the Home system.\n\n110\n00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,660\n>> Oh that's right, yeah,\nwhen we covered installing Windows 8,\n\n111\n00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,480\nand what versions do what.\n\n112\n00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,252\nThat's right, so Enterprise.\n\n113\n00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:36,890\n>> Yep.\n>> So the Enterprise edition of Windows 8\n\n114\n00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,230\nincludes AppLocker and\nnone of the others, right?\n\n115\n00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,110\n>> Exactly.\n>> Word.\n\n116\n00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,630\n>> Pay that extra money,\nyou get all those cool features.\n\n117\n00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,478\n>> Yep, like AppLocker.\n\n118\n00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:45,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n119\n00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,610\n>> All right, sweet,\nyeah other cool tools in there too.\n\n120\n00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,540\n>> Yeah, BitLocker's another one.\n\n121\n00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,310\n>> Yeah, Windows To Go.\n\n122\n00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,300\n>> Yeah, it's worth the extra money for\nthat license, right?\n\n123\n00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,045\n>> Yeah and we'll get into that\nstuff later, a little bit later.\n\n124\n00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,228\n>> Yes.\n>> All right, well yeah, okay, sweet, so\n\n125\n00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:01,960\nAppLocker, that's what it does.\n\n126\n00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,730\nWell, lets get inside.\n\n127\n00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,368\n>> Yeah let's take a look,\nlet's see where we want to use it,\n\n128\n00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:10,070\nso we can really configure AppLocker\nin a couple of different ways, right?\n\n129\n00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,670\nWell, two different ways.\n\n130\n00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,040\nWe can do a local policy, where\nyou're looking at setting that up for\n\n131\n00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,010\njust that one machine.\n\n132\n00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,975\nOr we could do a domain-based policy,\nwhere we affect the,\n\n133\n00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,940\naffect not infect, [LAUGH] affect\nall of the machines on our network,\n\n134\n00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,050\nor wherever we want to\nscope that policy to.\n\n135\n00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,230\nWhich is probably more common, right?\n\n136\n00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,810\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know the local policy,\n\n137\n00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,510\nthe thing about the local policy is\nyou're only affecting that one machine.\n\n138\n00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,580\nSo if you do it that way,\n\n139\n00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,710\nyou've got to touch every machine\nthat you want to do AppLocker on.\n\n140\n00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,310\nIf it was a one-off machine like a kiosk,\nmaybe use the local policy.\n\n141\n00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,580\nBut if you're wanting to affect all\nthe machines in the sales department,\n\n142\n00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,150\nyou wouldn't use the local policy,\nyou'd use that domain-based policy.\n\n143\n00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,620\n>> Yeah, and I'm glad you're here for\n\n144\n00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,780\nthat stuff because I don't set\nup a lot of group policy things.\n\n145\n00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,940\n>> Well let's get in there and\nplay, let's show them.\n\n146\n00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,460\n>> Well yeah, okay, well shoot, well yeah,\nyou can, all right Mike, so let's see.\n\n147\n00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,925\n>> He kids, he knows all of this stuff.\n\n148\n00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:14,230\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nlet's see, all right, the mouse.\n\n149\n00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,190\n>> So you guys in a previous\nshow had installed a program.\n\n150\n00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:18,770\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n151\n00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,790\n>> Right?\n\n152\n00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,000\n>> All right, okay, yeah,\nthanks for bringing that up.\n\n153\n00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> I appreciate that, all right, so okay.\n\n154\n00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,590\nSo yeah, in the last episode, right, so\n\n155\n00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,370\nwe saw how to use msiexec to\ninstall the Steam client.\n\n156\n00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,525\n>> Okay.\n>> Which the Steam client is a game portal\n\n157\n00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:42,225\nor what not, a little program that runs on\nthe machine that gives access to games.\n\n158\n00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,095\n>> Skyrim.\n\n159\n00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,685\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean, all kinds of games, but\n\n160\n00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:45,990\nSkyrim's the only one that's worth it.\n\n161\n00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,345\n[LAUGH]\n>> Unreal Tournament?\n\n162\n00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,015\n>> Oh yeah, that's true.\n\n163\n00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:50,450\nWe gotta play some\nUnreal Tournament as well, yes.\n\n164\n00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,960\nSo great program but\n\n165\n00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,760\nprobably not something that we want\nrunning on our Enterprise machines, maybe?\n\n166\n00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,600\n>> Correct.\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n167\n00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,320\nin most places I would assume, right?\n\n168\n00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,112\nYou don't want to see the Steam client\ninstalled on everybody's machine.\n\n169\n00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:06,073\nSo on this machine we have\nthe Steam client installed.\n\n170\n00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:06,677\n>> Okay.\n\n171\n00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:09,312\n>> And so what we're gonna do\nis We're gonna lock it down.\n\n172\n00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:09,974\n>> Nice.\n\n173\n00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:14,037\n>> And now to kind of limit\nthe scope of everything,\n\n174\n00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:18,600\nwe are going to leave out\ndomain based group policy.\n\n175\n00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,150\n>> Okay.\n>> And\n\n176\n00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,980\nwe'll focus on the local group policy.\n\n177\n00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,930\nAnd the steps to do it are still the same,\nthough.\n\n178\n00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,720\n>> They're gonna be the same, yeah.\n\n179\n00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,240\n>> Right.\n>> It's just a matter of where,\n\n180\n00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,300\nwhat policy you're using.\n\n181\n00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,137\nSo, yeah, it'll be exactly\nthe same in a domain-based policy.\n\n182\n00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, we can cover that in another\n\n183\n00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,830\nshow when we get into group policy, and\nwe start looking at domain-based policies.\n\n184\n00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,420\n>> Yeah, and that's actually,\nyeah, what we're gonna do.\n\n185\n00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,070\nSo, all the, yeah,\nthe policy stuff and everything,\n\n186\n00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,770\nlocking stuff down and really getting\nin there and yeah, doing stuff.\n\n187\n00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,640\nWe're gonna save that for one show and\n\n188\n00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,500\nwe're just gonna spend all the time-\n>> Cool.\n\n189\n00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,160\n>> In there and whatnot.\n\n190\n00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,580\nBut with-\n>> Make sure you invite me back\n\n191\n00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,255\nfor that one.\n\n192\n00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:56,535\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah for sure.\n\n193\n00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,048\n[LAUGH] Right up your alley.\n\n194\n00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,050\nBut with AppLocker, and\n\n195\n00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,340\nthe stuff we're gonna do today we\nhave to do it through group policy.\n\n196\n00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,010\n>> Okay.\n\n197\n00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,040\n>> All right.\n\n198\n00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,170\nSo yeah, let's walk down this steam clean.\n\n199\n00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,090\n>> Let's do it, let's do it.\n\n200\n00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,362\n>> Alright.\n>> No steam for you.\n\n201\n00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:12,760\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> That's right.\n\n202\n00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,685\nNo no no no.\n\n203\n00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,600\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n204\n00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,480\nOkay, so first thing's first, right?\n\n205\n00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,040\nWe've got to get into the policy editor.\n\n206\n00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,430\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nIf we're going to edit that local\n\n207\n00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,050\ngroup policy.\n\n208\n00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,398\nSo if we can pull up your computer,\nperfect.\n\n209\n00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:29,548\n>> And gpedit.\n\n210\n00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:32,540\n>> gpedit.msc.\n\n211\n00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,200\n>> Now if we don't put in the msc,\nright, nothing shows up.\n\n212\n00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,570\n>> It does not search.\n\n213\n00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,150\nIt does not find it, does it?\n\n214\n00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,060\n>> No.\n>> Really Microsoft?\n\n215\n00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,110\nWhat are you doing to me here?\n\n216\n00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,500\n>> Msc.\n>> Yeah, you gotta put that msc\n\n217\n00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,920\non the end of it or\nit wont find that console.\n\n218\n00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,431\nI'm sure we could go and adjust our index\nsettings, but yeah, that's another show.\n\n219\n00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:52,140\n>> And\nthat's how you would fix it index cards?\n\n220\n00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,848\n>> That would be my first guess yes.\n\n221\n00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:57,265\nit is finding it if you put the extension.\n\n222\n00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:59,474\nSo that might be something\nthey're blocking intentionally.\n\n223\n00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:02,265\n>> Nice, all right, sweet, okay.\n\n224\n00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:05,829\nSo what we're going to\ndo is in the computer\n\n225\n00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,815\nconfiguration right\nunder Windows settings.\n\n226\n00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:10,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n227\n00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,620\n>> And security settings.\n\n228\n00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,345\nAnd in here we have\napplication control policies.\n\n229\n00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:17,845\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n230\n00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,092\nAnd there we go AppLocker.\n\n231\n00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,260\nAll right so there we go.\n\n232\n00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:29,530\nNow to configure AppLocker right you\nmention the creating the default rules so\n\n233\n00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,562\nthat's the first thing that needs to\nhappen creating these default rules.\n\n234\n00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:38,325\nAll right now there are there's four\ndifferent ways to configure AppLocker,\n\n235\n00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,140\nright.\n\n236\n00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,260\nSo we've got executable rules.\n\n237\n00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,380\n>> Which if you're trying to block\na .exe-based file from running,\n\n238\n00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,840\nwe've got our executable rules.\n\n239\n00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,730\n>> Windows installer rules.\n\n240\n00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,860\n>> Which you guys covered a little\nbit in the previous show.\n\n241\n00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,428\n>> An MSI file, if I want to block an MSI.\n\n242\n00:10:56,428 --> 00:11:01,402\nAnd I'll block the MSI from executing,\nright?\n\n243\n00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:02,250\n>> Correct.\n\n244\n00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,120\n>> So it's still running something, so\nbut executable rules are for like EXEs.\n\n245\n00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,770\n>> Yeah once you've installed the program,\nand\n\n246\n00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,610\nyou get the executable\nto launch the program,\n\n247\n00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,140\nthat's what we're really blocking there\nis the ability to run that application.\n\n248\n00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,190\nSay if you made an executable\nrule to block Steam.\n\n249\n00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,030\nIf you downloaded Steam, and\nit's an MSI to install it.\n\n250\n00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,145\nIt would still install successfully, and\n\n251\n00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,150\nthen it just wouldn't run\nbecause of that executable rule.\n\n252\n00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,330\nBut normally we'd set up all of them.\n\n253\n00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,300\nWe do AppLocker.\n\n254\n00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,450\nOr we do executable rules,\nas well as MSI rules.\n\n255\n00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,780\nAs well as script rules.\n\n256\n00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,689\nAs well as our package app rules.\n\n257\n00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,610\n>> All right.\n\n258\n00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,310\n>> So, to cover all the bases.\n\n259\n00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,120\n>> And, you can still have rules for\neach one of these things and\n\n260\n00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,320\nhave like rules sets.\n\n261\n00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,430\nRight?\nOr something?\n\n262\n00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,897\n>> There are that you can create,\nyou can do them individually or\n\n263\n00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:55,700\nyou can do them as a group.\n\n264\n00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,270\nLike we could just configure in fact I\nthink what we're gonna do today is just\n\n265\n00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,180\nconfigure an executable rule.\n\n266\n00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,029\nAnd we'll probably leave the other ones\nalone, but we could create sets yes.\n\n267\n00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:13,050\n>> Now the script rules right,\nso blocking running scripts.\n\n268\n00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:19,593\nRunning scripts would be like\na little miniature kind of program\n\n269\n00:12:19,593 --> 00:12:24,690\nin a way that's just lines\nthat run lines of code.\n\n270\n00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,470\n>> Yeah, like a .bat file or\na .cmd or something like that.\n\n271\n00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,300\nIn the corporate environment we use\nthem a lot of times as long on scripts.\n\n272\n00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,070\nThings that we want to execute\nevery time somebody logs on.\n\n273\n00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,200\nBut you can make scripts out of anything,\nright?\n\n274\n00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400\nYou can take your command prompt\nsyntax fill it in text file,\n\n275\n00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,930\nrename it as a .BAT and\n\n276\n00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,860\nnow you got a script to automate what you\nare normally having to type in manually.\n\n277\n00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,200\nBut script can have some I don't\nknow a good way to say that.\n\n278\n00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,730\nThey can be, they can be powerful,\n\n279\n00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,980\ndepending on the level of\naccess they can do some damage.\n\n280\n00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,170\nSo we can block those as well.\n\n281\n00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:58,990\n>> Mm.\n\n282\n00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,820\nNow, PowerShell.\n\n283\n00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,385\nPowerShell is a scripting thing.\n\n284\n00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:03,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n285\n00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,930\nPowerShell would fall in there too, right?\n\n286\n00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,300\n>> A .PS1 file.\n\n287\n00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,480\n>> .PS1 file.\n\n288\n00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,110\nAnd PowerShell can do\ndad-gum near everything.\n\n289\n00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,820\n>> Everything.\n\n290\n00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,010\n>> So to lock that thing down,\nyou have a user,\n\n291\n00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,860\nright, he may be just clicking stuff like\noh, an attachment in an email, click.\n\n292\n00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,780\nSo blocking things like that\nwould be good in some situations.\n\n293\n00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n294\n00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,955\n>> And the last one we have\nhere packaged app rules.\n\n295\n00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now a packaged app, so\n\n296\n00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,255\nthat's our-\n>> It's Christmas time.\n\n297\n00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:37,806\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not the same?\n\n298\n00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:38,765\nNot what you're talking about?\n\n299\n00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:39,556\nOh okay.\n\n300\n00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:40,825\n>> I was just thinking about presents.\n\n301\n00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:42,230\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n302\n00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,640\n>> Packaged app rules.\n\n303\n00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,300\nSo that's our WIndows 8 modern style apps.\n\n304\n00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,450\nSo we get a desktop app.\n\n305\n00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:55,420\nAnd last episode we, desktop apps,\nand Windows store apps.\n\n306\n00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,840\nSo we've got executable rules,\nwhich yeah, stops desktop apps.\n\n307\n00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,770\n>> Desktop apps, yeah.\n\n308\n00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,690\nSo you guys did, well you've all\nready looked at the Windows 8 apps?\n\n309\n00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,000\n>> Yeah, yep.\nOh, from the store?\n\n310\n00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,630\n>> Cool.\nYeah, so that's the only difference here.\n\n311\n00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,410\nIf you're trying to block\nan old desktop app, or\n\n312\n00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,460\nI guess what we would call a desktop\ninterface app, the .EXEs, we use that one.\n\n313\n00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,230\nIf we're trying to block one of the new\n\n314\n00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,590\nWindows 8 style apps since we\ncan't say that interface anymore.\n\n315\n00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,825\nThat Windows 8 interface style app.\n\n316\n00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:29,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You would use your packaged app rules.\n\n317\n00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,580\nExactly.\n\n318\n00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,840\nBut it's same thing, just a different type\nof application we're trying to block.\n\n319\n00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,000\n>> Yeah, after a Steam client\n>> Right?\n\n320\n00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,480\nSo we're gonna, we'll get to that.\n\n321\n00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,960\n>> Okay.\n>> We'll get to that later.\n\n322\n00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,560\n>> The suspense is killing me.\n\n323\n00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,980\nLet's get in here and look at this.\n\n324\n00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,720\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, Executable Rules,\nthis is what we're gonna do, right?\n\n325\n00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,680\nAll right, so we'll come over here, and\n\n326\n00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,970\nso on your recommendation-\n>> You can do it either way and\n\n327\n00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,110\nchoose whichever one you want.\n\n328\n00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,620\nIf you create a new rule,\n\n329\n00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,690\nwhat'll happen is it'll walk\nyou through creating the rule.\n\n330\n00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,520\nAnd then when you get done,\nwhen you get to the end,\n\n331\n00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,580\nit's going to say, I noticed you\nhaven't created your default rules.\n\n332\n00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,550\nWould you like me to create them for you?\n\n333\n00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,810\nOr you can be proactive and\nyou can go ahead and do it,\n\n334\n00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,370\nwhich is probably a better thing, right?\n\n335\n00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,560\nWhy hope the wizard prompts you?\n\n336\n00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,570\nWhy not go ahead and\nmake them ahead of time.\n\n337\n00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,830\nAnd plus we can look at them.\n\n338\n00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,870\nWe can see them and\nwe can talk about them.\n\n339\n00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,230\nThere they are.\n\n340\n00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,562\nThere's those beautiful default rules.\n\n341\n00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:23,430\n>> All right, so\n\n342\n00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,470\nwe got all these allow rules,\n>> Mhm.\n\n343\n00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:31,070\n>> So allow ones will,\nwe have allow and deny,\n\n344\n00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,620\nso allow rules will in this will help\nprevent us from locking ourselves out.\n\n345\n00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,675\n>> Exactly, cuz as we said at\nthe beginning of the show.\n\n346\n00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:41,400\nAppLocker is going to work\non an implicit deny so\n\n347\n00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,110\nif I don't specifically allow it its\ngoing to block it or attempt to block it.\n\n348\n00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,210\nSo this prevents if you want to\nlook at that first rule there.\n\n349\n00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,360\nSo what is it, all files located\nin the program file folder.\n\n350\n00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,750\nAnd that's the default location\nwhere we install applications right?\n\n351\n00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,430\nSo when the administrator\ninstalls an application,\n\n352\n00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,230\nyou install an application it goes\ninto the program files directory.\n\n353\n00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,597\nAnd this is going to make sure you can\nrun that program you just installed.\n\n354\n00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,278\nOr is already installed on that machine.\n\n355\n00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:14,171\nAnd then that second rule Is gonna be the\nall files located in the Windows folder,\n\n356\n00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:19,734\nwhich is C:Windows where my operating\nsystem is, which I like to run that.\n\n357\n00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:20,698\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n358\n00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:21,300\n>> So yeah, if you\n\n359\n00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,780\nwant to continue to use your operating\nsystem then that's a good rule to have.\n\n360\n00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,899\nAnd then the last one, just make sure\nthat the administrators get a free pass.\n\n361\n00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,630\nSo it's good to be the administrator.\n\n362\n00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,390\n>> Right?\n\n363\n00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,430\nNice.\nNice, sweet.\n\n364\n00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,370\n>> All right.\n\n365\n00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,300\nYeah, so\nnow you've got your default rules.\n\n366\n00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,180\nAnd the next step then\nwould be to go ahead and\n\n367\n00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,700\nstart creating your custom rules to block\nthe applications that you want to block.\n\n368\n00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,960\n>> All right.\n\n369\n00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,400\nOkay, so we've got these Create New Rules.\n\n370\n00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,680\nAnd then down here we have\nAutomatically Generate Rules.\n\n371\n00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,930\nNow from my understanding if you have\n\n372\n00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,175\na like a batch set of apps\nthat you wanna block.\n\n373\n00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:00,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n374\n00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,940\n>> Then you can create\nsome kind of file or\n\n375\n00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,290\nwhatnot, and\nrun this Automatically Generate Rules.\n\n376\n00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,200\nAnd it will like just make\na whole bunch of AppLocker rules.\n\n377\n00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,950\n>> It really makes this, especially\nif you're going from if you've got\n\n378\n00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,070\na heavily domained forest or something.\n\n379\n00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,850\nAnd you want to implement the same\nrules across multiple domains,\n\n380\n00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,110\nthat might make it a little bit easier.\n\n381\n00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,190\nOr you could have somebody else that's\nnot able to create group policies, that\n\n382\n00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,380\nis able to create this file and generate\nthis list of programs we gotta block,\n\n383\n00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,110\nthen they pass that on to the person\nthat's responsible for creating the GPOs.\n\n384\n00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,330\nAnd all they gotta do is come in here and\nautomatically generate rules and\n\n385\n00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,380\nwe should be good to go.\n\n386\n00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:40,920\nHopefully.\n\n387\n00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,976\nThat's if everything goes well,\nwhich we know in Windows it always does.\n\n388\n00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:49,167\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n389\n00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,990\ncreate new rule,\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n390\n00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,406\nAll right so here we start off\nwith a little wizard here.\n\n391\n00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:59,540\n>> We've got our little intro page,\nwhatnot.\n\n392\n00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,320\nConfirm that the following steps are\ncomplete, install the application, yada,\n\n393\n00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,510\nyada, yada, all right.\n\n394\n00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,323\n>> Yeah,\nthe stuff we always just kinda gloss over.\n\n395\n00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:08,065\nIt is good information though.\n\n396\n00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,109\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> [COUGH] Back up your existing rules\n\n397\n00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:10,973\njust in case.\n\n398\n00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,935\nYeah cuz we always do that.\n\n399\n00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:15,220\n[LAUGH]\n>> No,\n\n400\n00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,410\nI did not run a back\nup before we did this.\n\n401\n00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,850\n>> Good to know that you can\nback up your rules, though.\n\n402\n00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,690\nGood to know.\n\n403\n00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,250\n>> Select an action to use, and\nuser group the rule should apply to.\n\n404\n00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,520\nSo, we're going to set a deny rule,\n\n405\n00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,370\nbecause we want to stop\nSteam from running.\n\n406\n00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,450\nRight, cuz now it's a problem.\n\n407\n00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,850\nAll the employees now have\nbeat all my high scores\n\n408\n00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,047\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> And\n\n409\n00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,610\nwe've already set the default rules.\n\n410\n00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,270\nThe program's already installed.\n\n411\n00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,470\nWe've set our default rule that allows\nanything that's in the program's files\n\n412\n00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,060\ndirectory to run so\nat this point Steam is allowed to run.\n\n413\n00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,190\nSo our first decision, are we trying to\nallow something or block something and\n\n414\n00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,220\nwe want to block something.\n\n415\n00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,590\nSo we choose deny.\n\n416\n00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,230\nThen our second choice is\nwho are we trying to block?\n\n417\n00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:01,870\nEveryone?\n\n418\n00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,440\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Is it just those people that beat\n\n419\n00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,410\nyour high score?\n\n420\n00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,010\nWe could make a group and then put those\npeople in there and just block them.\n\n421\n00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,830\nThat's heavy duty.\n\n422\n00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,420\n>> Yeah, so depending on what\nyou're trying to do there.\n\n423\n00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,698\nBut yeah, we'll block everyone.\n\n424\n00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:17,865\nIt's our workplace, and\nprobably shouldn't be playing Oblivion.\n\n425\n00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,859\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n426\n00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:28,632\nhere's three ways that we can lock\nit down or deny or allow something.\n\n427\n00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:33,160\n>> We've got to identify what it is\nwe are trying to block or allow.\n\n428\n00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,870\nRight.\n\n429\n00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,390\nAnd we can identify it by publisher.\n\n430\n00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,110\n>> Publisher, right so\nthe person who made it.\n\n431\n00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,414\nRight?\n>> Like Microsoft or whomever.\n\n432\n00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:44,477\n>> Right.\n\n433\n00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:45,580\nPath, right?\n\n434\n00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,330\nSo, we're gonna block it by a path, and\n\n435\n00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,550\na path is where it resides\non the hard drive.\n\n436\n00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:56,200\nSo if it installs to SQL and\nC:\\Steam\\ whatever,\n\n437\n00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,390\nthen we can lock down whatever\nis in C:\\Steam, right?\n\n438\n00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,625\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd even if it goes into program files,\n\n439\n00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,323\nwe've allowed anything in\nthe program files directory.\n\n440\n00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:10,369\nBut this would then say, but\nnot C:\\Program files Steam or\n\n441\n00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:12,281\nwhere ever it happens to go.\n\n442\n00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:12,824\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n443\n00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:15,752\nAlso interesting, or\na good thing to note there,\n\n444\n00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:18,620\nthis is probably the easiest\nrule to get around.\n\n445\n00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:25,990\n>> Because if your user is savvy at all,\nwe know that most installation programs,\n\n446\n00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,400\nI could choose custom\ninstallation instead of default.\n\n447\n00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,030\nAnd then one of my choices in that custom\ninstall is typically where do you want to\n\n448\n00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,590\ninstall it to.\n\n449\n00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,540\nAnd so\nnow it's not the path that you blocked,\n\n450\n00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,180\ncuz that should Hey lets\ninstall it on D:\\Steam.\n\n451\n00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,490\nWell your rule says C:\\Steam, and\nit's not going to block it then.\n\n452\n00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,948\nIt is easy to get around this rule,\nwhich is one of the downsides of it.\n\n453\n00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:53,297\n>> Well then okay, so\nwhat would you say then,\n\n454\n00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:57,380\nwould blocking it by a path work?\n\n455\n00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,940\n>> Yes.\nIt will definitely work for\n\n456\n00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,265\nhalf of my users, you know?\n\n457\n00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:05,700\n[LAUGH] How many of my users actually know\nhow to go through a custom installation on\n\n458\n00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,575\nan application?\n\n459\n00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:08,355\n[LAUGH] That becomes the real question.\n\n460\n00:21:08,355 --> 00:21:12,613\n[LAUGH] So it depends on the skill set\nof your end users and most of my end\n\n461\n00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:17,490\nusers can not figure out how to print\ntheir spreadsheet in landscape format.\n\n462\n00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,740\nI feel pretty safe with the path rule.\n\n463\n00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,420\n[LAUGH].\n\n464\n00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,573\nSorry my users,\nhopefully you guys aren't watching this.\n\n465\n00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:32,040\n[LAUGH] You're really not that bad.\n\n466\n00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,370\n>> Yeah, we're streaming out to everybody.\n\n467\n00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:34,910\n>> That's true.\n\n468\n00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,852\nAll right, we'll I'll make\nit up to them at some point.\n\n469\n00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:43,970\n>> All right, so\nthe first path we've got file hash.\n\n470\n00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:50,910\nNow file hash is the exe or\nthe file's signature.\n\n471\n00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,630\nOr its little integrity check thing.\n\n472\n00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,190\nYeah.\n\n473\n00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,018\n>> Exactly.\n\n474\n00:21:57,018 --> 00:22:04,530\nMaybe you could obtain a signature for\nthe application from the vendor, possibly.\n\n475\n00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,430\nBut easy enough just to\ncreate your own hash.\n\n476\n00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,930\nGet your little hashing algorithm and\nmake a hash of that application.\n\n477\n00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,320\nI think we've talked about\nit in another episode, but\n\n478\n00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,600\na hash just being a, you take a file,\nin this case our program.\n\n479\n00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,070\nRun it through the hashing algorithm.\n\n480\n00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,720\nGenerates a value.\n\n481\n00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,360\nAnd you can run that thing through\nthat hashing algorithm 20 times,\n\n482\n00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,290\nalways gonna generate\nthe exact same values, So\n\n483\n00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:32,100\nit's like a way to now\nidentify that set of files.\n\n484\n00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,030\nSo, that one is we we're talking about the\npath rule and how I could get around that.\n\n485\n00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,800\nThe signature one a little\nmore difficult to try and\n\n486\n00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,800\nget around because that signature\nidentifies that program now.\n\n487\n00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,685\nSo it takes a little more\nwork to get that set up.\n\n488\n00:22:46,685 --> 00:22:48,135\nYou've gotta have that signature but\n\n489\n00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:53,535\nit's less likely that your end user is\ngoing to be able to bypass your policy.\n\n490\n00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,185\n>> All right, what about this,\n\n491\n00:22:55,185 --> 00:22:59,060\nlet's say that Steam 10.1 comes out\n>> And\n\n492\n00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,520\nso now the users have\ndownloaded Steam 10.1.\n\n493\n00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n494\n00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,701\n>> Now it has a new hash than Steam 10.0\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n495\n00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:09,480\n>> New file, same utility, different hash\n>> New rule.\n\n496\n00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,490\n>> Than it would run if it we\njust did this hash rule, right?\n\n497\n00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,760\n>> Yeah,\nyou have to add a new hash to your rule.\n\n498\n00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,210\n>> Wow.\n\n499\n00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,573\n>> Fun stuff isn't it,\nthat's why you get paid the big bucks.\n\n500\n00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:21,273\n[LAUGH] So for\n\n501\n00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:25,823\nall of you guys that are going to get paid\nthe big bucks once you to finish this.\n\n502\n00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:27,324\nYeah, AppLocker.\n\n503\n00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:27,904\n>> Wahoo!\n\n504\n00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:32,060\nAll right so\nwell identify it by path or publisher.\n\n505\n00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,817\nYou're gonna do publisher?\n\n506\n00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:34,906\n>> Let's do publisher.\n\n507\n00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:37,157\n>> So now we're going to-\n>> It is by far my favorite options.\n\n508\n00:23:37,157 --> 00:23:37,810\n>> Oh yeah, publisher is?\n>> Because\n\n509\n00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,040\nof the slider you get right here.\n\n510\n00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,360\n>> Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n>> This is just really cool.\n\n511\n00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,210\n>> Yeah, and I thought, for our demo\npurposes, cuz I like the slider, too.\n\n512\n00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,865\n>> Yeah, it's very cool.\n\n513\n00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:48,031\n>> And you can pick, well,\nwe'll get to that in a second.\n\n514\n00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:48,740\n>> Yeah.\nShow them.\n\n515\n00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,323\nShow them.\n\n516\n00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:50,616\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n517\n00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:53,293\n>> Okay, so, we clicked on, so\n\n518\n00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:58,338\nBrowse Files, so\nthis is the file that we want to block.\n\n519\n00:23:58,338 --> 00:23:59,079\n>> Correct.\n\n520\n00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,445\n>> All right, now the Steam gets\ninstalled into Program Files/x86 And\n\n521\n00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:10,390\nthere is the steamy.exe, and\nin there is, right there, so that's it.\n\n522\n00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,880\nThis is what we want to stop.\n\n523\n00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,790\n>> Now in this case, we're going by\npublisher, so you might be thinking,\n\n524\n00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,590\nwell, why are you browsing\nthrough the executables?\n\n525\n00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,830\nWe need to get the information\nabout the publisher, and\n\n526\n00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,398\nit can pull all that information.\n\n527\n00:24:22,398 --> 00:24:23,850\nIsn't that cool?\n\n528\n00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,410\nIt pulls it all right\nfrom that executable,\n\n529\n00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,320\nwhere you can see the name of the\npublisher there, valve, the product name,\n\n530\n00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,316\nSteam Client Boot Strapper,\nfile name, and then file version.\n\n531\n00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:38,710\nIf you want to go,\nI could talk forever about this slider.\n\n532\n00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,032\nIt's just a really cool slider, isn't it?\n\n533\n00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:41,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I dunno why.\n\n534\n00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,730\nGeeky, I know.\n\n535\n00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,130\nBut it is pretty flexible.\n\n536\n00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,710\nLike as Nate slides that thing up, like\nright now it's going to block version,\n\n537\n00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,390\nmy old eyes could see that,\n1.88.56.76 and above.\n\n538\n00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,570\nBut if we want it be\na little less specific,\n\n539\n00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,390\nlike what about a previous version\nthat they found and tried to install.\n\n540\n00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,510\nIf you could slide that\nlittle slider up one.\n\n541\n00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,360\n>> I can't slide.\n\n542\n00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,245\n>> Not letting you slide?\n\n543\n00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:08,914\n>> Huh-uh.\n\n544\n00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:09,874\n>> Oh, no.\n\n545\n00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:11,550\n>> Now what?\n\n546\n00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,090\n>> Uncheck that Custom Values there.\n\n547\n00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,420\n>> There we go.\n\n548\n00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,088\nThere we go.\n\n549\n00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:21,690\nAll right, so yeah.\n\n550\n00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,380\nSorry, I didn't mean to take over, my bad.\n\n551\n00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,408\n>> Sorry, I get excited.\n\n552\n00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:28,250\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so yeah.\n\n553\n00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,900\nNow we can move the slider up to,\nI guess, restrict where\n\n554\n00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,380\nin the process this rule is going to\nkick in and block the steam file.\n\n555\n00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,946\n>> Yeah,\nit's about how specific you want to be.\n\n556\n00:25:38,946 --> 00:25:41,279\nIf you slide that back\ndown to file version.\n\n557\n00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,220\nIt's only going to block 1.88.0.0.0 and\nabove.\n\n558\n00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,000\nSo again, if they've got\nan older version of that client,\n\n559\n00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,280\nIt's not going to block it.\n\n560\n00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,360\nThat might be a little too specific for\nus.\n\n561\n00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,730\nThat also takes care of the new one,\n\n562\n00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,330\nthe one you were asking about, what\nabout the 1.9 that comes out tomorrow?\n\n563\n00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,370\nWell, this says and above.\n\n564\n00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,670\nBut if you slide that up one,\nnow we're saying, anything made by valve,\n\n565\n00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,430\nsteam name, steam client boot strapper,\nsteam.exe, don't care what version it is.\n\n566\n00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,650\nThat asterisk is my wild card in there.\n\n567\n00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,310\nYou take it up one more,\nnow you've gone file name, so\n\n568\n00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,420\nanything with a product name, so anything\nwith the name Steam Client Boot Strapper.\n\n569\n00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,660\nTake it up one more and it's anything\nmade by Valve, at that point.\n\n570\n00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,470\nSo you can kind of get as specific\nas you need to with that ruler.\n\n571\n00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,032\n>> Nice, for our intents and\npurposes, for today,\n\n572\n00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:31,266\nwe're just going leave it all\nthe way down there at the bottom.\n\n573\n00:26:31,266 --> 00:26:32,336\n>> Works for me.\n\n574\n00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:34,690\nSlide it up one.\n\n575\n00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,190\nI like that one better.\n\n576\n00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,765\nThat way you're not tied\nto a particular version.\n\n577\n00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,254\nIt's my thing.\n\n578\n00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:48,250\n>> [LAUGH] All right, now, we click next,\nand on this one we can set exceptions.\n\n579\n00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,050\nNow, I would think if we slid that\nslider and blocked everything\n\n580\n00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:58,150\nby Valve, but we wanted to allow\njust Valve's, I don't know,\n\n581\n00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:03,678\nhigh score overwriter program, that we\nwanted to overwrite everyone's high score.\n\n582\n00:27:03,678 --> 00:27:07,700\n>> That's exactly what we're doing, we're\njust making an exception to our rule here.\n\n583\n00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,480\nYou see,\nthere's a lot of time's when you've got\n\n584\n00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,900\nthe big vendors that provide you\na lot of different software products,\n\n585\n00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,830\nsuites of utilities, and you want to\nblock one or part, but not all of it.\n\n586\n00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,590\nThis is what you would do here, is you'd\njust come back in and say I want to\n\n587\n00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,990\nblock everything by Adobe, except for\nAdobe Photoshop or something like that.\n\n588\n00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,560\n>> All right.\n\n589\n00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,610\nNice.\n\n590\n00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,530\nAll right.\n>> We don't have any.\n\n591\n00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,030\nWe're just going to leave\nthose exceptions blank.\n\n592\n00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,390\n>> All right, and\nthis is the name here, our rule name.\n\n593\n00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,520\n>> It really does create a very nice name,\ndoesn't it?\n\n594\n00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,300\n[LAUGH]\nYou're more than welcome to change that.\n\n595\n00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,170\nI would make it something just\na little more meaningful so\n\n596\n00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,050\nthat other administrators would know what\nthe heck you did and why you did it maybe.\n\n597\n00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,240\nDescriptions are always nice.\n\n598\n00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,420\nI'm guilty of never filling\nin the descriptions,\n\n599\n00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,880\nbut the more info you\nput in there the better.\n\n600\n00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,650\nAgain, in larger environments, you're\nnot the only admin working in there.\n\n601\n00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,790\nOther admins get in there,\nis like, what is this for?\n\n602\n00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,705\nOh, for no more high scores.\n\n603\n00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:13,325\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now we know why that as created.\n\n604\n00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:19,405\nBecause Nate was getting pissed that\neverybody was beating his high score.\n\n605\n00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:22,050\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I made this joke earlier.\n\n606\n00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,380\nI'll make it to you.\n\n607\n00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,670\n>> Okay.\n>> I have a Nintendo Wii.\n\n608\n00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,890\nI like this Wii a lot.\n\n609\n00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,010\nIt's fun.\nI've got some games for\n\n610\n00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,230\nit, party games, and I take it places.\n\n611\n00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,270\nMy wife and I and my kid,\nwe take it to people's house and we play.\n\n612\n00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,815\n>> You have a little Wii battle at\nthe front door when you show up?\n\n613\n00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:41,690\n[LAUGH] Alright.\n\n614\n00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,980\n>> I remember that, yeah.\n\n615\n00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,790\n>> It was a commercial.\n\n616\n00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,140\n>> Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's funny.\n\n617\n00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,550\nI forgot about that.\n\n618\n00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,340\nIf you look on my Wii,\nI don't have any high scores.\n\n619\n00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,590\nIt's all my friends.\n\n620\n00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,090\n>> Oh yeah?\n\n621\n00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,350\n>> On all my games, they have all the high\nscores and I'm down there at the bottom.\n\n622\n00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,555\n>> And it's your machine.\n\n623\n00:28:58,555 --> 00:28:59,310\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n624\n00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,600\n>> Nate got the highest scores.\n\n625\n00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,250\n>> Yep.\n\n626\n00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,900\nSo we're definitely going\nto lock Steam down.\n\n627\n00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,940\n>> Let's lock it down.\n\n628\n00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,610\n>> Yep.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n629\n00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,850\n>> All right, looking at the time,\n\n630\n00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,820\nwe're right up out of time, so what\nwe're going to do is we'll take a quick\n\n631\n00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,420\nlittle five-minute break and when we come\nback, we will complete the rule, and\n\n632\n00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,990\nwe'll check it out and\nsee if it still works.\n\n633\n00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,600\n>> See if it works.\n\n634\n00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,650\n>> Yep.\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n635\n00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,250\n>> Sweet.\n\n636\n00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,277\nAll right, we'll see you then.\n\n637\n00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:33,437\n[MUSIC]\n\n638\n00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:35,925\nWelcome back.\n\n639\n00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,150\n>> Whoo-hoo.\n\n640\n00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,210\n>> Picking up where we left off,\nfinishing the rule that we started.\n\n641\n00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n642\n00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,640\n>> And test to make sure that\nthe Steam client is indeed\n\n643\n00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,980\n>> It is indeed blocked, exactly.\n\n644\n00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,750\nBefore we went to break, we set up a rule\nthat should have blocked that Steam client\n\n645\n00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,300\nso nobody could beat Nate's\nhigh scores anymore.\n\n646\n00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,910\n>> I know.\n\n647\n00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,470\nIf only we had all day\nlong to play video games.\n\n648\n00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,380\n>> I'm telling you.\n\n649\n00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,340\n>> Then I could be at the top.\n\n650\n00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,370\n>> If I could get paid to do that.\n\n651\n00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,400\n>> I know, yeah, so anyhow.\n\n652\n00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,530\n>> Anyhow, all right.\n\n653\n00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,620\n>> So all right yeah, we're continuing on.\n\n654\n00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,270\nWe're creating our rule set,\nour rule thing and check it out.\n\n655\n00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,530\n>> Let's bring it back up and\nsee what we got.\n\n656\n00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,662\n>> Yup, we'll bring it back up and\nsee if we, okay woo-hoo.\n\n657\n00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:21,740\n>> [LAUGH] So we finished up\nto rehash that before break.\n\n658\n00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,465\nWe created our default rules that\nallowed everybody to run anything in\n\n659\n00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:31,510\nthe program pause directory, and\nthat allowed everyone to run anything in\n\n660\n00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:37,000\nthe Windows folder and\nthen the administrators get the free pass.\n\n661\n00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,350\nSo we've now made a rule.\n\n662\n00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,840\nWe did it based on the publisher,\nthat should end up locking Steam.\n\n663\n00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,382\nSo this is the last screen of\nthe wizard where we gave it a name and\n\n664\n00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:52,460\na description, and\nNate's going to click Create, and boom.\n\n665\n00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,000\nThere it is.\n\n666\n00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,940\nNothing blew up.\n\n667\n00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,570\n>> All right.\n\n668\n00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,670\nOkay.\nSo there it is.\n\n669\n00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,730\n>> And so there's our new rule.\n\n670\n00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,940\nDeny everyone Steam executable.\n\n671\n00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,750\nAll right.\n\n672\n00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,590\n>> All right.\n\n673\n00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,700\n>> So there's our rule, so let's run it.\n\n674\n00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,940\nAnd-\n>> And it runs.\n\n675\n00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,930\nWhat the heck?\n\n676\n00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,020\n>> It still runs.\n\n677\n00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,434\n>> Have we not had that episode yet?\n\n678\n00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:14,004\n>> [LAUGH] Which one?\n\n679\n00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:16,490\n>> So what do you guys\nthink out there in TV land.\n\n680\n00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,130\nWhat are we missing?\n\n681\n00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,190\nThat's right.\n\n682\n00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,190\nI heard you say we need to update\ngroup policies, because we just made\n\n683\n00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,070\na change to a policy, and policies are\nrefreshed when you start that computer up,\n\n684\n00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,360\nwhen the user logs on, and\nthen every 90 to 120 minutes thereafter.\n\n685\n00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,820\n>> 120?\n\n686\n00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,350\n>> 90 with a 30 minute random offset.\n\n687\n00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,520\nSo up to 120.\n\n688\n00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,320\nUp to 120.\n\n689\n00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,859\nSo Nate's going to type in gp update for\nus because we neither want to log off or\n\n690\n00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:45,420\nreboot the computer.\n\n691\n00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,860\nSo we're just going to force it to\ngo to refresh policy right now.\n\n692\n00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,045\n>> And you know, so\n\n693\n00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:55,393\nfar this year I don't think we've\nreally discussed what gp update force.\n\n694\n00:31:55,393 --> 00:32:00,172\nWe haven't touched much into\ngroup policy because we're\n\n695\n00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:03,787\ngoing to save it for\none big Try and show but.\n\n696\n00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:08,120\nSo the change that we made\nin the local group policy.\n\n697\n00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,640\nRight, so\nit applies to the whole computer.\n\n698\n00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,380\n>> Anywhere the log is on.\n\n699\n00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,460\nThe local account, the main account.\n\n700\n00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,780\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n701\n00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,970\n>> Yep, so to get.\n\n702\n00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,120\nSo to make those rules apply, right?\n\n703\n00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,270\nWe either have to log off and\nlog back on, but\n\n704\n00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,740\nthen we'd lose the connection to TV and\nall that other stuff.\n\n705\n00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:32,530\nWe run this command GPUPDATE/FORCE, and\nthat will reapply those rules, right?\n\n706\n00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,540\n>> Yeah, and we'll cover it again a little\nheavier when we get into our group\n\n707\n00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,260\npolicy show.\n\n708\n00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,980\nBut gpupdate on its own\nwithout the /force,\n\n709\n00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,280\nnormally when gp refreshes,\nwhen group policy refreshes.\n\n710\n00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,560\nIt only refreshes policies\nthat have changed.\n\n711\n00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,240\nBecause why bother reapplying\na policy that has not changed?\n\n712\n00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,540\nBut sometimes that does\nnot seem to do the trick.\n\n713\n00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,860\nSo the force switch says look, reapply all\npolicies whether they've changed or not.\n\n714\n00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,030\nAnd that just ensures that\neverything is refreshed.\n\n715\n00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,540\n>> Nice.\n\n716\n00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,690\n>> So hopefully once we've done that\n>> It still runs.\n\n717\n00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,880\nThis is an issue that you'll\nhave with app locker.\n\n718\n00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,890\nSometimes it's a little slow in kicking in\n>> Now there is one step that I\n\n719\n00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:26,160\npurposefully left off, right ,to to try\nto get Mike all caught up in like oh no.\n\n720\n00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,989\n>> Alright let's see then.\n\n721\n00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,730\n>> So we refresh policy,\nall right, so that policy's there.\n\n722\n00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,230\nWe refreshed it, we could do a gp result\nto verify that the policy's in place.\n\n723\n00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,620\nBut there is something that\napplocker relies on, and\n\n724\n00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,580\nthere's some other settings\nthat we might not have finished\n\n725\n00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,480\nin the group policy itself\n>> Maybe.\n\n726\n00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,505\n>> Eh, just trying to trick us?\n\n727\n00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,660\n>> Mm-hm, all right.\n\n728\n00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,260\nSo, for AppLocker to work, right?\n\n729\n00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,490\nThere is a service that\nneeds to be started,\n\n730\n00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,100\nthat is called\nthe Application Identity Service.\n\n731\n00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,740\nAnd it lets AppLocker know,\n>> what applications are running, so\n\n732\n00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,580\nit can catch it and stop it.\n\n733\n00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,250\n>> Exactly.\n\n734\n00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,000\nI'm gonna guess that that\napplication identity service,\n\n735\n00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,975\nis what identifies the applications?\n\n736\n00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:15,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n737\n00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,940\n>> Hence the name\nApplication Identity Service.\n\n738\n00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,900\nSo yeah,\nlet's say that one has to be running,\n\n739\n00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,880\notherwise AppLocker's not gonna work.\n\n740\n00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,320\nSo we need to, one make sure it's running,\nand two make sure that it's set to start\n\n741\n00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,520\nautomatically, so if they reboot\nthe computer that service does kick in.\n\n742\n00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,080\n>> So, let.\n\n743\n00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,050\n>> Let's check it.\n\n744\n00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,490\n>> Let's check it out and\nsee if it's running.\n\n745\n00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,360\nAll right.\n\n746\n00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,790\nSo we will browse to our start screen, and\n\n747\n00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,410\ntype in services.\n\n748\n00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,230\nAll right?\n\n749\n00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,070\nView local services.\n\n750\n00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,930\nAll right, here we go.\n\n751\n00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:51,585\nHere is all of our services,\nright, that runs on here.\n\n752\n00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:52,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n753\n00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:55,240\nthe one that we want is\ncalled Application Identity.\n\n754\n00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,150\n>> There she is.\n\n755\n00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,550\n>> There it is, and\nit is not

Beautiful.\n\n759\n00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,510\nNow it's running.\n\n760\n00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,153\nSo it should be running now, right?\n\n761\n00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:08,818\nMaybe.\n\n762\n00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:13,050\n[LAUGH] Let's see if we can\ntrick Nate up with this one.\n\n763\n00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,720\n>> Alright let's see if we're.\n\n764\n00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,660\n>> Oh.\n>> Let's update that thing again.\n\n765\n00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,490\nJust to make sure.\n\n766\n00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:25,200\n>> Let's do

songs, can I?\n\n770\n00:35:33,911 --> 00:35:37,080\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, yeah, sometimes it takes a minute,\n\n771\n00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,410\neven after refreshing the policy,\nand it's calling out all that stuff.\n\n772\n00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,332\nIt could take\n>> Yeah if, if it weren't [CROSSTALK]\n\n773\n00:35:44,332 --> 00:35:47,796\nhooked up to the TV and sharing your\nscreen out I would say reboot the machine.\n\n774\n00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:51,480\nI, I've seen applocker policies take,\nmore than one reboot.\n\n775\n00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,520\nOne or two reboots,\nto get everything kicked in.\n\n776\n00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,540\nGet that service a chance to start up,\nand do its thing.\n\n777\n00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,833\n>> So it's, it's one of those\npolicies in a corporate environment,\n\n778\n00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,630\nthat we are going to set,\nand then check on.\n\n779\n00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,280\nWe know it is going to kick in eventually.\n\n780\n00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,780\nAnd we are usually not worried about it.\n\n781\n00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,220\nLetting the application run one or\ntwo more times.\n\n782\n00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,370\nEventually it is going to kick\nin an block that application,\n\n783\n00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,700\nassuming we created the rules\ncorrectly in the first place.\n\n784\n00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,539\n>> So there is one more\nplace that we can [LAUGH]\n\n785\n00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:19,781\n>> There he is, there he is.\n\n786\n00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:22,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think what Nate is trying to stump us\n\n787\n00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,070\nwith\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n788\n00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,550\n>> is that we've created the rules\n\n789\n00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,230\n>> But we didn't really turn them on.\n\n790\n00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:32,250\nThere's another step in that policy\nthat we have to go through to enable\n\n791\n00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,140\nthe rules we created, and it's kind of\ncool, cuz it does give us the ability to\n\n792\n00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,870\ndisable all the rules real quick,\nif we're trouble shooting.\n\n793\n00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,205\nYou know, we think this rule is causing\na problem, we can go in here and\n\n794\n00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:42,790\nturn these things off.\n\n795\n00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,710\nSo what Nate's gonna do,\n\n796\n00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,218\nis he's gonna pull up\nthe properties of AppLocker itself.\n\n797\n00:36:46,218 --> 00:36:50,070\nHe's gonna right-click on App Blocker,\nchoose properties, and\n\n798\n00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,170\nwe get this dialogue box that has the four\ndifferent categories that we have,\n\n799\n00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,490\nthe different rule categories\nthat we can create.\n\n800\n00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:01,230\nAnd as you can see, we created a publisher\nrule, which is actually going to end\n\n801\n00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:06,120\nup falling under executables, cuz in the\nend it's going to block that steam.exe.\n\n802\n00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,680\nSo it's not configured.\n\n803\n00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,060\nSo by checking that little check mark,\nthat says okay,\n\n804\n00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,480\nnow I want to enforce all of those\nexecutable rules that you've created.\n\n805\n00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,580\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n806\n00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,460\n>> And then as Nate's pointing out there,\nwe've got a really nice drop down list.\n\n807\n00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,080\nWe can use this to block Steam, or\n\n808\n00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,820\nwe could just find out how many\npeople are actually running steam.\n\n809\n00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,260\nBecause first thing we\nhave to do is determine\n\n810\n00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,650\nwho has been beating your high scores.\n\n811\n00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,280\nBecause sometimes those gamer tags\nare not really identifiable so.\n\n812\n00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,230\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n813\n00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,420\nThey are all different.\n\n814\n00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,762\n>> So we could run it audit only,\n\n815\n00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:40,710\nwhere it's gonna allow Steam\n>> But\n\n816\n00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,270\nthen log who has been running Steam.\n\n817\n00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,680\nThen we can go back and look at our\nlog files, find all those user,\n\n818\n00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,800\nput them in a group, and block them.\n\n819\n00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,025\n>> Yep.\nAnd then turn off their key FOBs and\n\n820\n00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:53,000\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n821\n00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,462\nTake away their parking spot.\n\n822\n00:37:54,462 --> 00:37:58,000\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwe're gonna enforce though, right?\n\n823\n00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,600\nCuz we wanna actually block this thing.\n\n824\n00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,740\n>> Yep.\n\n825\n00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,830\nApply and okay.\n\n826\n00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,230\nOn more time, because we did\nmake a change to the policy.\n\n827\n00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,300\nAnd then you keep your fingers crossed,\n\n828\n00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,653\nhave a little Mountain Dew\nwhile you are waiting.\n\n829\n00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:16,607\nAll right, there you go.\n\n830\n00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:20,300\nAlright it has done its thing.\n\n831\n00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:28,190\nDrum roll please, oh my goodness,\nno more Steam for you.\n\n832\n00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,820\n>> Your system administrator\nhas blocked this program.\n\n833\n00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,030\nFor more information contact\nyour system administrator.\n\n834\n00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:41,790\nSo there you go, so we blocked it, now we\ndid this using the local group policy.\n\n835\n00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,900\nAnd we can, I guess.\n\n836\n00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,520\n>> A typical use of app blocker will\nbe through the domain group policy.\n\n837\n00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so this will be company wide then.\n\n838\n00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,410\n>> Yeah.\nAnd the policy's gonna look\n\n839\n00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,260\nexactly the same.\n\n840\n00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,150\nWhen you get into a domain based policy,\nsame setting, same options.\n\n841\n00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,880\nYou know, again the whole idea about\nusing a domain based policy is just\n\n842\n00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,900\ncentralized management.\n\n843\n00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,570\nWhen I wanna effect more than one machine,\nwe're gonna go the simplest route, right?\n\n844\n00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,565\nWhatever means the least work for us.\n\n845\n00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:15,095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or it could be, well not that I'm lazy.\n\n846\n00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:18,210\n[LAUGH] You've got to work smarter and\nnot work harder.\n\n847\n00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:18,840\nRight?\n\n848\n00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,420\n>> I like that.\n\n849\n00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n850\n00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,390\n>> I like that Mike, that's good.\n\n851\n00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,390\nI like it.\n>> Now, you might have a situation where\n\n852\n00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,550\nI'm okay with them playing Steam\nin their cubicle during lunch.\n\n853\n00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:33,080\nBut they cannot be playing Steam\nin that conference room machine.\n\n854\n00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,520\nWhere people can walk by and\nsee them, and things like that.\n\n855\n00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,676\nSo that might be a situation where I use\nthe local policy cause I only have to\n\n856\n00:39:40,676 --> 00:39:42,353\naffect that one machine, and\n\n857\n00:39:42,353 --> 00:39:46,597\nit's easier than trying to filter\nthe main policy down to the one machine.\n\n858\n00:39:46,597 --> 00:39:48,431\nJust make a local policy\non that one machine.\n\n859\n00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,334\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n860\n00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,390\nThanks Mike.\n\n861\n00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,112\n>> You got it.\n\n862\n00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:55,814\n>> Now continuing on with this.\n\n863\n00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:59,913\nSo we've locked Steam down and\nnow nobody can play their steam game.\n\n864\n00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:06,190\nSo now the employees have\nmoved on to the Windows Store.\n\n865\n00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:09,710\nSo, let's say now they are playing\nMinesweeper, which I like Minesweeper.\n\n866\n00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,445\n>> Love Minesweeper.\n\n867\n00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:11,865\n>> I haven't played it in a while but.\n\n868\n00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:13,535\n>> It has changed.\n\n869\n00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:14,415\n>> Yeah.\n\n870\n00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:18,635\nThe Windows Store they have\na version of minesweeper.\n\n871\n00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:20,505\n>> The new minesweeper\nis pretty darn fancy.\n\n872\n00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,995\nIt's not like the old minesweeper.\n\n873\n00:40:22,995 --> 00:40:24,355\n>> Right.\n>> But still minesweeper.\n\n874\n00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,200\n>> So all of our users have now\ndownloaded Minesweeper, and once again,\n\n875\n00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,740\nthey're playing it all the time and\n\n876\n00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,610\nI want to brag about my four\nminute long eight by eight win.\n\n877\n00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,750\n>> Nice.\n\n878\n00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,440\n>> Yes, I know.\n\n879\n00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,440\nSo know,\nI don't even want people to play it.\n\n880\n00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,240\nBut before I do that,\nbased off your suggestion,\n\n881\n00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,690\nI would like to find out\nwho is playing Minesweeper.\n\n882\n00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,380\nSo, we won't lock it down,\nbut we will restrict well,\n\n883\n00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,030\nwe just want to find out who's doing it.\n\n884\n00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,970\n>> So\nwe have to go through the same process.\n\n885\n00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,900\nWe have to create that rule,\nyou have to decide, well,\n\n886\n00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,400\nhow you're going to identify that program.\n\n887\n00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,540\nBut on that last step that we did,\nin that drop down list instead of enforce,\n\n888\n00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,009\nwe're gonna choose audit and that way\nit'll still allow Minesweeper to run, but\n\n889\n00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:16,698\nwill generate the log entries we\nneed to determine how many people or\n\n890\n00:41:16,698 --> 00:41:20,156\nwho is actually playing Minesweeper\non our company machines.\n\n891\n00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:24,471\n>> You know what, let's do it real quick.\n\n892\n00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:27,336\n>> Why talk about it when we can do it.\n\n893\n00:41:27,336 --> 00:41:29,034\n>> The magic of computers.\n\n894\n00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:29,536\n>> Yes.\n>> So\n\n895\n00:41:29,536 --> 00:41:32,778\njoining back over to our machine here.\n\n896\n00:41:32,778 --> 00:41:34,610\nSo we'll clear these guys out.\n\n897\n00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,270\nAll right,\nnow Minesweeper's on the Windows Store.\n\n898\n00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,170\nWe can jump over here real quick and\nthere is our Minesweeper.\n\n899\n00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,750\nAnd we can run the thing and it is.\n\n900\n00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,400\nYou already blocked it?\n\n901\n00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,470\n>> Already blocked.\n\n902\n00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,065\nWell.\n>> Try that again.\n\n903\n00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:51,827\nSure enough.\n\n904\n00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:54,070\n>> Sure enough.\n\n905\n00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:58,090\n>> Well let's go look at our rules and\nsee what the heck is going on there.\n\n906\n00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:58,760\n>> So this might, yeah.\n\n907\n00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,282\n>> Good for\ntroubleshooting our AppLocker policies.\n\n908\n00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:06,260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Alright, so the Windows Store apps\n\n909\n00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,040\nare down in the package app rules\n>> Yeah, different category here.\n\n910\n00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,440\nSo now we're going to be moving down into\nthis packaged app rules category which is\n\n911\n00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,370\nagain for the new, for lack of better\nterm, the new Windows 8 interface.\n\n912\n00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,958\nWhatever we're going to call\nthose pretty tiles that we have.\n\n913\n00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:26,770\n>> Full screen, non-stackable titles.\n\n914\n00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:27,340\n>> That's right.\n\n915\n00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:32,020\nWe're still waiting for a good,\ndo we have a term for that yet?\n\n916\n00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,280\n>> I think the closest we\ngot is Modern UI Style.\n\n917\n00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,680\n>> Modern UI, all right.\n\n918\n00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,190\nBecause the original name,\nobviously, with the lawsuit,\n\n919\n00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,500\nthey're unable to get\ncontinue to call it that so.\n\n920\n00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,270\n>> Which I liked metro.\n\n921\n00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,260\n>> I did too.\n\n922\n00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:44,920\n>> It was fun.\n\n923\n00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,650\nOh yeah, metro going metro.\n\n924\n00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,540\n>> It worked for me.\n\n925\n00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,510\n>> Alright so looking in our rules,\nwhy is it blocked?\n\n926\n00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,210\nWe don't even have any rules to enforce.\n\n927\n00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,120\n>> I've got nothing in there.\n\n928\n00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,490\nWho knows what is going on here?\n\n929\n00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What have you done to this machine?\n\n930\n00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,850\nThat's what I would say to my end user.\n\n931\n00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,250\n>> What did you do, what did you do?\n\n932\n00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,975\n>> That's right, it's all their fault.\n\n933\n00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:06,902\n[LAUGH]\n>> Step one, put it back in the box.\n\n934\n00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:14,606\nAlright, now I think I know what's up.\n\n935\n00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:15,230\nWhat are you thinking?\n\n936\n00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,470\n>> I'm going to follow your lead on this\none because I'm looking at those rules and\n\n937\n00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,900\naccording to the rules it doesn't\nlook like its being blocked.\n\n938\n00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,930\nI'm thinking we made a rule that's\nblocking steam, we did it by publisher.\n\n939\n00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,683\nBut I don't believe Minecraft is\ncreated by Steam or Minesweeper.\n\n940\n00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:32,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry, they might make Minecraft.\n\n941\n00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,209\nMinesweeper is not a Steam product, so\n\n942\n00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:37,784\nthat rule we made should\nnot be affecting it.\n\n943\n00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:39,890\n>> Yeah, and yeah.\n\n944\n00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,440\nSo, I think, what I'm going to go with is\nthat we don't have the default rules for\n\n945\n00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,835\ncreated for this.\n\n946\n00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:46,240\n>> Very good.\nVery good.\n\n947\n00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,260\n>> But I mean, I don't know, let's try it.\n\n948\n00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,635\n>> Check it out and see here if we\nshould be able to open up that.\n\n949\n00:43:50,635 --> 00:43:51,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well,\n\n950\n00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:55,480\nif you click on, we can't see your screen,\nbut if you click on the.\n\n951\n00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,410\nYeah, there's no rules in there, so\nthere are no Default Rules listed.\n\n952\n00:44:01,156 --> 00:44:02,451\n>> So, there's that, and\n\n953\n00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:05,970\nwe're just gonna keep going with\nthe whole kinda scenario thing.\n\n954\n00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:10,490\nWell, actually we should check\nto make sure it's even working.\n\n955\n00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,270\n>> Yeah, let's test it.\n\n956\n00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,440\nWe're gonna have to refresh that policy.\n\n957\n00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,925\n>> Let's turn this on and\nlet's just set this to audit, alright.\n\n958\n00:44:19,925 --> 00:44:21,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n959\n00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,710\n>> Alright, there we go.\n\n960\n00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,253\nAudit and we'll refresh that policy.\n\n961\n00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:36,050\nAll right, with our Gpupdate force, so\nwe are pushing out those rules again.\n\n962\n00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,860\nLet the guy know the change that we made.\n\n963\n00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,550\n>> Which again brings us back to\nour first segment of this show.\n\n964\n00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,780\nApp blocker works on an implicit deny.\n\n965\n00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,300\nSo as soon as we started making rules to\nblock something, even though there were no\n\n966\n00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,740\nrules blocking the new modern style apps,\nthey were indeed being blocked.\n\n967\n00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,430\nSo it goes on that implicit deny.\n\n968\n00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,910\n>> All right.\nSo now that that's taken effect,\n\n969\n00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,318\nlet's see if we can run Minesweeper.\n\n970\n00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,012\n>> Beautiful.\n\n971\n00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:07,230\nLook at that.\n\n972\n00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,600\nAlmost makes me wanna start up a new game.\n\n973\n00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,220\n>> So\neven though we weren't implicitly denying.\n\n974\n00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,400\n>> We weren't explicitly denying.\n\n975\n00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,270\n>> Explicitly denying, so yeah.\n\n976\n00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,940\nSo we weren't explicitly\ndenying Minesweeper.\n\n977\n00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,750\nWe weren't also allowing it to run.\n\n978\n00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:33,880\n>> Again implicit deny, meaning that I\ndon't have to specifically deny you.\n\n979\n00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,470\nImplicit means it's just everything is\ndenied unless I specifically allow it.\n\n980\n00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,600\nEven though I don't make a rule to block\nit, if it's not on the allow list,\n\n981\n00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,880\nit's gonna be blocked.\n\n982\n00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,800\n>> All right?\n>> Yep.\n\n983\n00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,720\n>> Sweet.\n>> Exactly.\n\n984\n00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,295\n>> Well, it's working now,\nso now let's shut it down.\n\n985\n00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:52,967\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now that it's working, let's block it.\n\n986\n00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:56,770\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n987\n00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:02,030\nCreate a new packaged rule, so\nwe've got our little intro screen again.\n\n988\n00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:06,560\nWe're going to allow the program to run,\nbut we want it to generate an event so\n\n989\n00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,730\nwe can find out who is blocking it.\n\n990\n00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,770\n>> You could really do either there.\n\n991\n00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,740\nYou could also choose deny but\nthen just audit,\n\n992\n00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,490\nwhich is typically, depending on\nwhat you're planning on doing.\n\n993\n00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,900\nIf you were eventually planning on\nblocking it, you might wanna go ahead and\n\n994\n00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,310\nset this rule up as a deny, but\nthen just do an audit-only.\n\n995\n00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,780\nThen if you decide to actually block it,\n\n996\n00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,780\nall you gotta do is switch that drop down,\nand you're blocking.\n\n997\n00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,900\nYou don't have to recreate your rule.\n\n998\n00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,210\nOtherwise you're gonna have to\ncome back and edit the rule, and\n\n999\n00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,040\nchange it from allow to deny,\nwhich is not difficult.\n\n1000\n00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,040\n>> Yeah, let's do that.\n\n1001\n00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,960\nAll right, so it will be a deny,\nand we're gonna do it to everybody,\n\n1002\n00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,770\nget them just stay away\nfrom groups at this point.\n\n1003\n00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,836\nNow we have to select\nthe app as a reference.\n\n1004\n00:46:48,836 --> 00:46:52,295\n[MUSIC]\n\n1005\n00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:52,910\nQuite a few in there.\n\n1006\n00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,302\n>> Get to see all the things\nthat Nate has in his file.\n\n1007\n00:46:57,302 --> 00:47:01,390\n[LAUGH] This is like an open\nup your history on live TV.\n\n1008\n00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,075\n>> I can't cover my screen from viewers.\n\n1009\n00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:04,200\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's up there.\n\n1010\n00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,120\nAll right, so there is Minesweeper.\n\n1011\n00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,560\n>> Minesweeper, all right.\n\n1012\n00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,650\n>> All right, there's this guy.\n\n1013\n00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,280\nNow we could also use a packaged\napp installer as a reference so\n\n1014\n00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:20,870\nthe installer would be, I'd say,\nin one example, when sideloading apps.\n\n1015\n00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,800\n>> So\nyou got your own modern interfaced app.\n\n1016\n00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,260\n>> It's got its own installer package and\nthen from the last episode when we\n\n1017\n00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:34,155\ndo sideload, yeah, the app-\n>> That custom app that you made.\n\n1018\n00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:35,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Congrats.\n\n1019\n00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,700\n>> Thank you.\n\n1020\n00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,220\nThank you.\n\n1021\n00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,790\nSo yeah, we can use that as a reference.\n\n1022\n00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,570\nAnd similar to the executable rules.\n\n1023\n00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:46,490\nSo we still have our publisher,\nour package name, and package version.\n\n1024\n00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,183\nAnd I think it worked out\npretty well last time.\n\n1025\n00:47:50,183 --> 00:47:51,803\n>> Works for me.\n\n1026\n00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:56,212\nI like that instead of being quite so\nspecific, 1.66.0.2,\n\n1027\n00:47:56,212 --> 00:48:01,393\nI like sliding that up one and just Doing\nthe Insight no matter what version it is.\n\n1028\n00:48:01,393 --> 00:48:03,052\n>> All right.\n\n1029\n00:48:03,052 --> 00:48:08,590\nNow, would you say that to restrict it\ndown to that specific file version.\n\n1030\n00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,230\nSo if you're running a line of business\napp and there is a known bug in that\n\n1031\n00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:18,450\nversion that conflicts with other stuff,\nthen you could choose just that version.\n\n1032\n00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,490\nAnd so, anything before or\nafter or whatever\n\n1033\n00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:22,036\n>> Was still running.\n\n1034\n00:48:22,036 --> 00:48:23,030\n>> Just this.\n\n1035\n00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,420\n>> Yeah and in fact,\nif you slide that down,\n\n1036\n00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,600\nback down one, you'll see that by default,\nwe've got n above.\n\n1037\n00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:34,160\nAnd I don't know if it's gonna\nlet you change that in this case.\n\n1038\n00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,730\nThere you go.\n\n1039\n00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:40,720\nAnd you can see exactly, and\nthen that way, like you were saying,\n\n1040\n00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:47,419\nif there was 1.6.3 or 1.6.5 was okay,\nthis would just block 1.6.4.\n\n1041\n00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:48,703\n>> Nice.\n\n1042\n00:48:48,703 --> 00:48:50,674\nIn this case,\nwe don't want any minesweeper to run.\n\n1043\n00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:52,080\nSo let's drag that up.\n\n1044\n00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,880\n>> Make me cry.\n\n1045\n00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,470\nOh man.\n\n1046\n00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:59,290\n>> All right, exceptions,\nagain, for these.\n\n1047\n00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,360\n>> For this one, no.\n\n1048\n00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,000\nBut, now this is where we could tell,\nif you went back and\n\n1049\n00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,330\nslid that slider all\nthe way back to Microsoft,\n\n1050\n00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,060\nwe've got a lot of things on our computer\nthat happen to be made by Microsoft.\n\n1051\n00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,930\nThat's where we would definitely want\nto start listing some exceptions.\n\n1052\n00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:17,745\n[LAUGH] Depends on how productive\nyou want your end users to be.\n\n1053\n00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:21,220\n>> Yeah, a lot of calls that day.\n\n1054\n00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,460\nOkay, so all right.\n\n1055\n00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,800\nI guess you could look at it one way.\n\n1056\n00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,800\nI guess you could then block everything.\n\n1057\n00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,640\nSo I drag this end theory.\n\n1058\n00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,630\nI drag it up to Microsoft.\n\n1059\n00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,170\nRight?\nSo let's go to our last screen.\n\n1060\n00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,310\nSo we drug it up here.\n\n1061\n00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:41,925\nSo now, anything that was published\nby Microsoft would then be blocked.\n\n1062\n00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:44,105\n>> Yep.\n>> So we could block everything and\n\n1063\n00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:46,045\nthen go into the exceptions list and\n\n1064\n00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:48,335\nthen name the few things\nthat we do want to run.\n\n1065\n00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:53,205\nWhich if we use Microsoft as an example,\nit could be a pretty long list, right?\n\n1066\n00:49:53,205 --> 00:49:54,245\n>> Yeah.\nThat would be rather\n\n1067\n00:49:54,245 --> 00:49:55,190\ntedious I would think.\n\n1068\n00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,600\nSo I would slide that back down one.\n\n1069\n00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,122\nOkay, I like that.\n\n1070\n00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,990\nAll right and we'll go Next.\n\n1071\n00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:05,298\nAll right no exceptions for our intents.\n\n1072\n00:50:05,298 --> 00:50:11,180\nAnd oops,\n\n1073\n00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:16,919\nwell, we'll just keep this\nin our best practices.\n\n1074\n00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:17,930\n>> There we go. Yep. I like that.\n\n1075\n00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,539\n>> Because there will\nbe other admins around.\n\n1076\n00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:25,233\n>> No Minesweeper for you.\n\n1077\n00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:30,450\n[LAUGH]\nThere you go.\n\n1078\n00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,320\n>> All right.\n\n1079\n00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,140\nGet back to work.\n\n1080\n00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:33,820\n>> Get back to work.\n\n1081\n00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,830\nAnd we will create that rule and\nthere it is.\n\n1082\n00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,050\nSo, now what we'll do\nthen is we'll go back.\n\n1083\n00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,140\nNot there, but here.\n\n1084\n00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,240\nAnd the properties.\n\n1085\n00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,400\nOh, we already did that.\n\n1086\n00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,830\nSo, now it is in audit mode.\n\n1087\n00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,580\nAnd it won't be enforced.\n\n1088\n00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,230\nBut it's going to generate an event.\n\n1089\n00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:51,980\n>> Correct.\n>> All right.\n\n1090\n00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,400\nSo, we're going to come back here.\n\n1091\n00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,970\nAnd let's update this guy.\n\n1092\n00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,860\nWe've already got the service running\nfrom the last program that we blocked.\n\n1093\n00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,460\nSo we're good there.\n\n1094\n00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,750\n>> Any more loose ends this time?\n\n1095\n00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,380\n>> I don't think so.\n\n1096\n00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,210\n>> Anything else that we left out?\n\n1097\n00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:06,890\nI think we're good.\n\n1098\n00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,403\n>> Oh, did I forget to tell you?\n\n1099\n00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:10,572\nNo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1100\n00:51:10,572 --> 00:51:12,062\n>> I'm like, uh-oh.\n\n1101\n00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:13,580\nUh-oh, Mike.\n\n1102\n00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,250\nYep, okay.\nSo all right.\n\n1103\n00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,290\nSo we generate this guy.\n\n1104\n00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,730\nLet's come over here and you know what?\n\n1105\n00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:19,280\nIt's right here.\n\n1106\n00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,740\nSo we're gonna go ahead and yeah,\nI kinda need to close that out.\n\n1107\n00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:29,322\nOkay, so there,\nnow it's not running, all right?\n\n1108\n00:51:29,322 --> 00:51:30,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1109\n00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,820\n>> Run this guy, sure enough, it runs.\n\n1110\n00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,560\n>> It still runs.\n\n1111\n00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,450\n>> Right, okay, so\neverything's good, right?\n\n1112\n00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,700\nSo the user is none the wiser, right?\n\n1113\n00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,600\nEverything's fine.\n\n1114\n00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,080\n>> That's right,\nthat's right, they're happy.\n\n1115\n00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:45,360\n>> All right, so now running an audible,\nlet's check our events and let's see.\n\n1116\n00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,500\n>> Let's see what it did.\n\n1117\n00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,900\n>> And to get there,\n\n1118\n00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,200\nit will be in the event viewer, all right,\nwhich is right there view event logs.\n\n1119\n00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,430\nAll right.\n\n1120\n00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,580\nNow, the event viewer,\n\n1121\n00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,700\nwe're going to get into all the cool\nstuff that event view can do later.\n\n1122\n00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,958\n>> I tell you.\n\n1123\n00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:07,250\nSorry, I start geeking out on you\nagain because the event log system has\n\n1124\n00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:10,540\ndefinitely been improved over\nthe last few editions of Windows.\n\n1125\n00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,310\nAnd there's some really cool\nthings we can do in here.\n\n1126\n00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,485\nBut we'll save that for\nanother episode, so come back.\n\n1127\n00:52:17,485 --> 00:52:19,710\n[LAUGH]\n>> Get a lonely Friday night, right?\n\n1128\n00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:20,970\n>> That's right.\n>> When you don't get any,\n\n1129\n00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,636\nokay\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1130\n00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:26,580\n>> [LAUGH] That's every Friday night.\n\n1131\n00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:33,350\n>> We're gonna be in Applications and\nService Logs in Microsoft.\n\n1132\n00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,080\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1133\n00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,040\n>> In Windows.\n\n1134\n00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,880\n>> I like it.\n\n1135\n00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,760\n>> And AdBlocker.\n\n1136\n00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,080\n>> Makes it easier to find, doesn't it?\n\n1137\n00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,970\n>> And specifically,\npackaged at execution.\n\n1138\n00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:46,350\nAll right, right there.\n\n1139\n00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:49,170\nSo the very first one up there, a warning.\n\n1140\n00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:53,046\nAnd in the details or\nin the general section it says,\n\n1141\n00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:56,571\nMicrosoft Minesweeper was allowed to run,\nbut\n\n1142\n00:52:56,571 --> 00:53:02,450\nwould have been prevented from running\nif the app locker policy was enforced.\n\n1143\n00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,860\n>> And that's because we chose the deny\ninstead of allow on that one screen.\n\n1144\n00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,020\n>> Now you know what, Mike?\n\n1145\n00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,320\nThat has got to be\nthe most straightforward,\n\n1146\n00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,320\neasy thing I've seen in the log ever.\n\n1147\n00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,210\n>> It's a log entry that actually\nmeans something, you mean?\n\n1148\n00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:23,100\nAnd you don't have to go Google the event,\nI mean, Bing the event ID?\n\n1149\n00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,670\n>> Yeah, you're gonna Bing it?\n\n1150\n00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,995\n>> Yeah, because Bing is\neverybody's favorite search engine.\n\n1151\n00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:30,190\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, heck it'd be like.\n\n1152\n00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,310\n>> I've seen the commercial.\n\n1153\n00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:34,810\n>> Be an app generated error event,\nhashtag whatever and all this.\n\n1154\n00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,430\n>> Yeah.\n>> We're like wait, what?\n\n1155\n00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,120\nI don't understand.\n\n1156\n00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,630\nIf you're used to working with\nthe Windows event logs in the past.\n\n1157\n00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,850\nAnd there are still some,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n1158\n00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:47,930\nWe're used to seeing things like,\nidentity service 4532 event id 04 has,\n\n1159\n00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,610\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n1160\n00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,330\nAnd you're left kind of just wondering.\n\n1161\n00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:54,070\nYou still don't know.\n\n1162\n00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,420\nSo you have to go out there and do a\nlittle bit of searching on the event ids.\n\n1163\n00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,360\nBut very straight forward, right?\n\n1164\n00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,280\nEven a non admin, I think,\ncan figure that out.\n\n1165\n00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,660\nMinesweeper was allowed to run and\nit generated an entry.\n\n1166\n00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:10,703\nAnd let's take a look at our\nexecutable and DLL log up there.\n\n1167\n00:54:12,536 --> 00:54:13,860\nDo we have anything from prior?\n\n1168\n00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,286\nThat was a few minutes ago.\n\n1169\n00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:23,631\nI was looking for, you might have to\nscroll or filter for errors there,\n\n1170\n00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:29,648\nbut we should see some entries for when we\ntried to run, what did we block, Steam.\n\n1171\n00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,890\n>> There's one right there.\n\n1172\n00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,920\nProgram files,\nwith the little percent sign.\n\n1173\n00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,950\nIn the last episode, or\nthe few before that one, those little\n\n1174\n00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:49,660\nthe percent signs up there, it's kind\nof like a variable sort of in a way.\n\n1175\n00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,250\nSo anything, program files, so\neven though Steam is in program files x86\n\n1176\n00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,150\nwith those little percent\nthings in there so it is.\n\n1177\n00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,610\n>> Yeah,\nthat's an environment variable, right?\n\n1178\n00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:01,750\nCuz on certain systems,\n\n1179\n00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:05,490\nsomebody might have renamed\ntheir program files directory.\n\n1180\n00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,889\nRight?\nBut using that environment variable,\n\n1181\n00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:11,986\nany program can find that directory,\nbecause no matter what you've named it,\n\n1182\n00:55:11,986 --> 00:55:14,078\nI can get there % > Program Files > %.\n\n1183\n00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:18,246\nJust like saying, % > Username > % means\nwhatever user happens to be logged on or\n\n1184\n00:55:18,246 --> 00:55:20,890\nwhatever we're doing at\nthat point at that time.\n\n1185\n00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:21,780\nSo, yeah.\nThat's what we call\n\n1186\n00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,150\nan environment variable.\n\n1187\n00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,870\n>> Man, you and your big words.\n\n1188\n00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n1189\n00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,220\n>> All right, well, sweet.\n\n1190\n00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,210\n>> That's beautiful.\n\n1191\n00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,190\nThat's app locker.\n\n1192\n00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,700\nI think we've covered just\nabout everything with that.\n\n1193\n00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,790\nWe got to see all the different\nclasses of rules.\n\n1194\n00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,705\nThe executables.\n\n1195\n00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:43,740\nThe scripts, the program or the packaged\napp rules in the install rules.\n\n1196\n00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:47,718\nWe saw how we could block a program or\n\n1197\n00:55:47,718 --> 00:55:52,904\njust audit a program to find out\nhow many people are running it.\n\n1198\n00:55:52,904 --> 00:55:55,237\nAnd we really expand on that, we said,\n\n1199\n00:55:55,237 --> 00:55:58,510\nNate wants to find out who's\nbeating his high scores.\n\n1200\n00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:01,911\n>> [LAUGH] [LAUGH] Which is definitely\na good use for that auditing rule.\n\n1201\n00:56:01,911 --> 00:56:05,426\nBut another one in a corporate\nenvironment might be to determine,\n\n1202\n00:56:05,426 --> 00:56:09,460\nokay there's this app that we think a lot\nof people are using on our network.\n\n1203\n00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,940\nWe need to license it.\n\n1204\n00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,710\nI need to know how many people\nare actually running this program so\n\n1205\n00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:18,500\nI'm sure that I've got enough licenses\nto cover it in case we get audited.\n\n1206\n00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,730\nSo in that case I don't\nwant to block the program.\n\n1207\n00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:23,720\nBut I need to find out how many people\nare actually using the program so\n\n1208\n00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,950\nthat I can make sure we're covered\naudit wise for our licenses.\n\n1209\n00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,440\nSo there's another use for audit only.\n\n1210\n00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,500\n>> Nice.\n\n1211\n00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,620\n>> See, what else do we do?\n\n1212\n00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,310\nWe talked about that service.\n\n1213\n00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:36,838\nYou gotta have that service running or\nAppLocker doesn't work\n\n1214\n00:56:36,838 --> 00:56:40,040\nbecause that's what it uses to identify\nthe application you're clicking on.\n\n1215\n00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:46,170\nWe talked about updating the group policy\nto make sure our policy's in there.\n\n1216\n00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,580\nWe also saw how if you do not go back\ninto the properties of AppLocker and\n\n1217\n00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:55,510\ncheck that enforced,\nit will not enforce your rule.\n\n1218\n00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,740\nWe did not get a chance to talk\nabout software restriction policies.\n\n1219\n00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which we probably should mention.\n\n1220\n00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:06,963\n>> You know, we're right up on our break,\nand I know Mike, I'm sorry,\n\n1221\n00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:12,586\nbut there is one more thing we still have\nto do with AppLocker and we'll do that\n\n1222\n00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:19,270\nafter the break, and that is how to turn\nit off cause we can't just shut it down.\n\n1223\n00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,870\n>> We can't just pull the plug?\n\n1224\n00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:21,560\n>> No.\n\n1225\n00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,640\nNo, I know it.\n\n1226\n00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,350\nYou'd think so, but no.\n\n1227\n00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:27,360\n>> All right, so sit on the edge of\nyour seats waiting in suspense for\n\n1228\n00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,735\nhow you're gonna disable this stuff so\nthat you can get back to playing Steam.\n\n1229\n00:57:30,735 --> 00:57:34,655\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\nwe'll see you guys in a few minutes.\n\n1230\n00:57:34,655 --> 00:57:43,153\n[MUSIC]\n\n1231\n00:57:43,153 --> 00:57:43,814\n>> I like it.\n\n1232\n00:57:43,814 --> 00:57:46,460\n>> All right, and welcome back.\n\n1233\n00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,200\nAll right, so\nwe've got the AppLocker up and running.\n\n1234\n00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,270\n>> We do.\n>> I guess just to jump right back into\n\n1235\n00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:55,460\nit, so now, yeah, let's shut it down.\n\n1236\n00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,135\n>> Yeah,\nbecause we've successfully blocked Steam.\n\n1237\n00:58:00,135 --> 00:58:03,350\nWe have audited the use of Minesweeper.\n\n1238\n00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:08,180\nBut now we're decided that we no longer\nwanna implement any AppLocker policies\n\n1239\n00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:08,750\nat all.\n\n1240\n00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,310\n>> Yep.\n\n1241\n00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:12,350\nLet's say that the users now are so\ndisgruntled,\n\n1242\n00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:15,580\nnow everyone's showing up late,\nthey're taking longer breaks sensor it.\n\n1243\n00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,530\n>> And now.\n\n1244\n00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:19,150\n>> They are playing Candy Crush\non their phone instead.\n\n1245\n00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:21,875\nSo, it really hasn't helped at all.\n\n1246\n00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,320\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so now moving on to smart phones.\n\n1247\n00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,610\nAnd because we don't use company wide\nWindows 8 devices, or Windows phone 8.\n\n1248\n00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,180\n>> Not yet.\n\n1249\n00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:29,720\n>> Not yet.\n\n1250\n00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,140\nThat's right.\nWe are going to go ahead and\n\n1251\n00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,120\nturn all of that stuff.\n\n1252\n00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,890\n>> So, I can just go in and just.\n\n1253\n00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,210\nTo delete a rule.\n\n1254\n00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,940\nAll I had to do?\n\n1255\n00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:43,770\n>> Sort of.\nThere is a few little steps to properly\n\n1256\n00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:48,650\nshut down AppLocker, to make sure that\nthe rules are not being enforced anymore,\n\n1257\n00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,190\nbefore we shut everything down.\n\n1258\n00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:55,150\nOtherwise, there could be Little error and\nregistry keys floating around or\n\n1259\n00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,050\nsomething.\n\n1260\n00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,820\n>> So\nwe don't just want to kill the service and\n\n1261\n00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,900\nmove on, we want to go through\nthe proper procedures.\n\n1262\n00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,020\n>> Mmhmm.\n>> All right, show us how to do it.\n\n1263\n00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,760\n>> So let's go and do that.\n\n1264\n00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,400\nSo jumping back over into\nanother event viewer.\n\n1265\n00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:12,110\nIn here.\n\n1266\n00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:16,050\nSo what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to back into our rules and\n\n1267\n00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,140\njust delete those rules.\n\n1268\n00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,920\nSo we're going to delete our custom rules\nbut we're going to leave the default ones.\n\n1269\n00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,050\nAll right?\nSo with those deleted out of there.\n\n1270\n00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:31,700\nAnd we will update our policy.\n\n1271\n00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,670\nSo right now, and those default\nrules then just allow everything.\n\n1272\n00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,980\nSo allow everything, right?\n\n1273\n00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,720\n>> Nothing wrong with leaving those there.\n\n1274\n00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,920\nThey're not going to hurt anything.\n\n1275\n00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,020\n>> Yep, not yet.\n\n1276\n00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,090\nAnd by updating this policy, then, we're\nbasically pushing out to the machines\n\n1277\n00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:50,300\nthe fact that these programs are no\nlonger blocked or being audited.\n\n1278\n00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,770\n>> Yep.\n\n1279\n00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:57,620\nAnd then once the thing updates,\nand we have one more one?\n\n1280\n00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,310\nOh, yep.\nThere we go.\n\n1281\n00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:02,990\nSo let's make sure that\neverything is that's fine.\n\n1282\n01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:08,420\nSo, all right, so Steam runs.\n\n1283\n01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,210\n>> Yay.\nSteam is back.\n\n1284\n01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,370\n>> Steam is back.\n\n1285\n01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,300\nMinesweeper, of course, should always.\n\n1286\n01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:13,800\nOh yeah.\n>> Yep\n\n1287\n01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,370\n>> We didn't stop it\n\n1288\n01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,470\n>> All right, so now we stopped that one.\n\n1289\n01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,260\nWe're going to go back in there,\nand okay, sure.\n\n1290\n01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,190\nAll right, still works.\n\n1291\n01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,030\n>> Beautiful.\n>> We don't worry about\n\n1292\n01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,420\nchecking the logs right now.\n\n1293\n01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,090\nSo there's this.\n\n1294\n01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,320\nNo, everything works.\n\n1295\n01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,170\nAll right.\n\n1296\n01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:37,330\nSo now what we can do\nthen is now we can do,\n\n1297\n01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:41,620\ngo in here and\nwe can not enforce anything anymore.\n\n1298\n01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:42,350\n>> All right.\n\n1299\n01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,870\n>> So we go back into our policies.\n\n1300\n01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,455\nNothing is being enforces, right?\n\n1301\n01:00:47,455 --> 01:00:48,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1302\n01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:52,330\n>> And for safekeeping,\nwe're going to update the policy again.\n\n1303\n01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:52,990\nOne more time?\n\n1304\n01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:54,530\n>> One more time.\nSo now, the, so\n\n1305\n01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,990\nyeah now it won't be checking anything.\n\n1306\n01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,200\nAnd if there is any kind of remnants,\n\n1307\n01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,940\nit's only gonna be enforcing\nthe standard rules.\n\n1308\n01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:03,590\n>> I like it.\n\n1309\n01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,400\n>> And now\n>> Right?\n\n1310\n01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,970\nNow we can just shut down\nthat identity service.\n\n1311\n01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,760\nAnd I think we could\njust leave it running.\n\n1312\n01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,810\nIt doesn't hurt anything.\n\n1313\n01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,240\n>> Principle of least privilege.\n\n1314\n01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,520\nNot really principle of least privilege.\n\n1315\n01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,210\nThat's not where I'm going.\n\n1316\n01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,850\nWhere was I going with that.\n\n1317\n01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:22,250\nGood hardening practices, say don't\nhave unnecessary services running.\n\n1318\n01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,200\nThat's just something\nyou're not monitoring.\n\n1319\n01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,950\nSomething you're not patching.\n\n1320\n01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,730\nProve to be a vulnerability at some point.\n\n1321\n01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:30,750\nSo if we're not using it we\nmight as well shut it down.\n\n1322\n01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:34,410\nIt's one less process listed in\nour processes sucking up memory.\n\n1323\n01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,980\nTaking up our valuable resources.\n\n1324\n01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,349\nSo kill it.\n>> [SOUND] All right and\n\n1325\n01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:41,345\nit has been killed.\n\n1326\n01:01:41,345 --> 01:01:43,589\nWe stopped it and set it back to manual so\n\n1327\n01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:47,340\nit will not restart automatically\nwhen we reboot that computer.\n\n1328\n01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:47,840\nBeautiful.\n\n1329\n01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,040\n>> All right, and we are done in there.\n\n1330\n01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,080\n>> That's it, we've successfully disabled\n>> We'll update one more time.\n\n1331\n01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,460\nWe'll make sure the thing runs.\n\n1332\n01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,100\nAnd yeah, we should be good.\n\n1333\n01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:04,045\nSo now AppLocker then has been properly\ndisabled, shut down, turned off.\n\n1334\n01:02:04,045 --> 01:02:09,113\nAnd everything should\ncontinue [CROSSTALK].\n\n1335\n01:02:09,113 --> 01:02:12,920\nNow, we focused a lot on AppLocker.\n\n1336\n01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,530\n>> We did.\n\n1337\n01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:18,130\n>> The exam objectives specifically\ncall out AppLocker and configuring and\n\n1338\n01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:19,320\nknowing it.\n\n1339\n01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,420\n>> Because that is the latest and\ngreatest way to block applications,\n\n1340\n01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,520\nbut, it's not new, is it?\n\n1341\n01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,950\nWe had something prior to AppLocker\nthat accomplished the same thing.\n\n1342\n01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,320\nAnd that was?\n\n1343\n01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,690\n>> Software restriction policies.\n\n1344\n01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,720\nNow, CSO.\n\n1345\n01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,550\nIt's not focused on a whole lot anymore.\n\n1346\n01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:42,070\n>> We don't really have to,\nas far as the exam is concerned,\n\n1347\n01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:45,130\nwe don't have to worry about being asked\nabout software restriction policies or\n\n1348\n01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:45,680\nanything like that.\n\n1349\n01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,680\nBut what we need to know about them is\nthat AppLocker actually evolved from\n\n1350\n01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,750\nsoftware restriction policy.\n\n1351\n01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:56,160\nSoftware restriction policy's what we\nhad in XP and 2003 and prior to that.\n\n1352\n01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,650\nWith Vista 2008, we got the AppLocker\nwhich was the replacement or the new,\n\n1353\n01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,688\nimproved version of software\nrestriction policies.\n\n1354\n01:03:02,688 --> 01:03:08,690\nBut the AppLocker policies\nare only going to be recognized or\n\n1355\n01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:09,720\nthey're only going to affect.\n\n1356\n01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,950\nEffect, Windows Vista, Server 8 and later.\n\n1357\n01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,420\nSo in a mixed environment where I've\ngot some down level clients and\n\n1358\n01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:22,370\nXP clients sitting out there, how would\nI prevent that application from running\n\n1359\n01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:27,060\non those guys because they very well could\nbe the old school gamers that are beating\n\n1360\n01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,250\nyour high score still running that XP.\n\n1361\n01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,578\n>> Speed machine there and\n\n1362\n01:03:30,578 --> 01:03:34,665\nthe AppLocker policy we set is not\ngoing to stop them from running Steam.\n\n1363\n01:03:34,665 --> 01:03:35,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1364\n01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,850\n>> So we would have to use\na software restriction policy.\n\n1365\n01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:42,032\nSo any game, for the exam, what we need\nto know is that AppLocker really replaced\n\n1366\n01:03:42,032 --> 01:03:43,828\nsoftware restriction policies.\n\n1367\n01:03:43,828 --> 01:03:48,049\nAnd the other big thing to know about\nthem, is while we can use both of them,\n\n1368\n01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:52,742\nAppLocker policies for preventing the apps\nfrom running on my Windows Vista, 7,\n\n1369\n01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:53,948\nWindows 8 clients,\n\n1370\n01:03:53,948 --> 01:03:58,732\nsoftware restriction policies to prevent\nthat same app from working on Windows XP.\n\n1371\n01:03:58,732 --> 01:04:03,848\nWe cannot do them in the same\nGPO Cannot put them in the same GPO.\n\n1372\n01:04:03,848 --> 01:04:04,846\nYou can still use them both.\n\n1373\n01:04:04,846 --> 01:04:08,656\nIf you put them in the same GPO what's\ngonna happen is it's gonna ignore\n\n1374\n01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:13,180\nthe software restriction policy and\nonly apply the AppLocker policy.\n\n1375\n01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:16,890\nIf you need to use them both,\ncreate two separate GPOs.\n\n1376\n01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:21,520\nWe can still link them to the same\nlocation, the site domain OU.\n\n1377\n01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,885\nThey just can't be in\nthe same group policy object.\n\n1378\n01:04:23,885 --> 01:04:25,006\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1379\n01:04:25,006 --> 01:04:27,412\n>> And that's about all you need\nto know for that for the exam.\n\n1380\n01:04:27,412 --> 01:04:31,010\n>> Sweet, right on.\n\n1381\n01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:33,050\nWe're gonna go through setting them up,\nbut\n\n1382\n01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:34,890\nit is important to know\nthat they do exist.\n\n1383\n01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:35,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n1384\n01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,360\nAnd they worked very similar.\n\n1385\n01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,120\nThey have the same, you had to\nidentify your first, you had to decide\n\n1386\n01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,130\nwho you were going to try to block,\nif you were going to block or allow,\n\n1387\n01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:46,100\nwho you were going to block, how you\nwere going to identify the application.\n\n1388\n01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:49,930\nVery same concept just much\nmore simplified interface,\n\n1389\n01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:54,608\nvery wizard driven with the AppLocker, and\nagain, supported by the later operations.\n\n1390\n01:04:54,608 --> 01:04:55,527\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1391\n01:04:55,527 --> 01:04:56,276\nNice.\n\n1392\n01:04:56,276 --> 01:05:03,055\nAll right, yeah, so to continue on\nwith controlling access to stuff,\n\n1393\n01:05:03,055 --> 01:05:08,060\nthe next thing is to control\naccess to the hardware.\n\n1394\n01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,100\n>> Hardware.\nAll right.\n\n1395\n01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,540\n>> Now it's, I mean, it's a big thing.\n\n1396\n01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,844\nRight?\nCuz there's a lot\n\n1397\n01:05:12,844 --> 01:05:14,627\nof stuff that we can lock down.\n\n1398\n01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:17,110\nSo we can lock down printers.\n\n1399\n01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,400\nWho can print to what?\n\n1400\n01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,441\nWe can lock down whether or\nnot we want to allow use of webcams,\n\n1401\n01:05:22,441 --> 01:05:24,162\nremovable thumbdrives.\n\n1402\n01:05:24,162 --> 01:05:25,962\nI guess they're all removable\nif they're thumbdrives.\n\n1403\n01:05:25,962 --> 01:05:31,855\nBut, yeah, there's a whole world of\nthings out there that we can lock down.\n\n1404\n01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:37,540\nWhat we're gonna look at\nis where to do that and\n\n1405\n01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:42,730\nwe'll show a little\nexample on how to locked\n\n1406\n01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,910\noff thumb drives, and we'll go from there.\n\n1407\n01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:47,760\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n1408\n01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,550\nSounds exciting.\n\n1409\n01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,630\nI like it.\n\n1410\n01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:50,520\n>> Sweet.\n\n1411\n01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,380\nAll right.\n\n1412\n01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,640\n>> And as Nate's getting this all started\nand set up here, you might think, well,\n\n1413\n01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,550\nwhy do I need to block hardware?\n\n1414\n01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:58,970\nWhy would I wanna block hardware?\n\n1415\n01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,540\nBut a lot of company,\nespecially in more security environments,\n\n1416\n01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:06,020\na lot of our military bases and\nplaces like that, do not allow\n\n1417\n01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:10,040\nany type of thumb drive, any type of\nremovable media to come into the network.\n\n1418\n01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,690\nBecause it's so easy to,\nyou could do many things with that, right?\n\n1419\n01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:18,560\nWe could use that removable media\nto introduce malware into a system.\n\n1420\n01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,970\nYou could hide that thing in your pocket.\n\n1421\n01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,180\nGet access to the building.\n\n1422\n01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,350\nSlip it into a machine.\n\n1423\n01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,750\nOr the opposite.\n\n1424\n01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:27,690\nSteal data out of, right?\n\n1425\n01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,970\nGo in there,\nput a bunch of data on that thumb drive,\n\n1426\n01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:32,270\nand then walk out of the building.\n\n1427\n01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,370\nAnd even not malicious,\nit could be accidental.\n\n1428\n01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:38,750\nOur end users, thumb drives are really\nconvenient ways to move data around from\n\n1429\n01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,850\none machine to another,\ntake that stuff home so I can work on it.\n\n1430\n01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,630\nThey're also very easy to lose.\n\n1431\n01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:44,670\nVery easy to have stolen.\n\n1432\n01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:51,390\nSo one way to prevent that risk when\nwe're doing our risk mitigation in\n\n1433\n01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:56,140\nlooking at, trying to figure out,\n\n1434\n01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:00,030\nworking on our security policies is just\nto prevent those devices all together.\n\n1435\n01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:00,940\n>> Risk mitigation.\n\n1436\n01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,420\nThere you go with big words again.\n\n1437\n01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,175\n>> Oh sorry.\n\n1438\n01:07:03,175 --> 01:07:05,210\n[LAUGHTER]\n>> Mitigating that risk, yes.\n\n1439\n01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:10,050\nSounds fancy, just means we\nare trying to avoid that risk.\n\n1440\n01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:10,700\n>> Risk avoidance.\n\n1441\n01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,920\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n1442\n01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,320\n>> I thin Ronnie Wong, I think he has\nthis like big formula of everything that.\n\n1443\n01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,290\nOh he's not in here.\n\n1444\n01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:18,840\n>> Where did he go.\n\n1445\n01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,120\nHe is the risk analysis master.\n\n1446\n01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,750\n>> Oh yeah.\nHe's got the formulas and\n\n1447\n01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,652\nhe'll calculate stuff.\n\n1448\n01:07:23,652 --> 01:07:25,601\n[CROSSTALK] And whether or\nnot it's a good idea.\n\n1449\n01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:26,510\nEverything.\n\n1450\n01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:27,200\n>> Yep.\n>> All right-\n\n1451\n01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,155\n>> And definitely is a way to make sure\n\n1452\n01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:34,328\nthat's not gonna happen, is to prevent\nthe removal devices in the first place.\n\n1453\n01:07:34,328 --> 01:07:37,020\nIf they can't bring in thumbdrives, if\nthey cant plug 'e, it in to the computers,\n\n1454\n01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:40,670\nthey can't put sensitive data on there,\nthey'll leave it laying at Starbucks and\n\n1455\n01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:43,060\nhave somebody get access\nto that information.\n\n1456\n01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,560\n>> Yep, so show me what you got.\n\n1457\n01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,910\nLets lock this thing\n>> All right, so\n\n1458\n01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:48,135\nwhat we've got is a little thumb drive.\n\n1459\n01:07:48,135 --> 01:07:50,907\nRight?\nIt's just a, [CROSSTALK] yeah,\n\n1460\n01:07:50,907 --> 01:07:57,420\nit fits on my little keychain, and it's\njust a little Kingston little flash drive.\n\n1461\n01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,350\nRight?\n\n1462\n01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:00,216\nAnd yeah, so\nwe're going to lock this thing down.\n\n1463\n01:08:00,216 --> 01:08:01,121\n>> All right.\n\n1464\n01:08:01,121 --> 01:08:01,890\n>> All right.\n\n1465\n01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:05,051\nNow, so\nI'll insert it into the computer here.\n\n1466\n01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:09,100\nAnd let's see.\n\n1467\n01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,380\nYep, all right.\n\n1468\n01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,730\nSo, it'll pop up, right?\n\n1469\n01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:13,340\nIt's recognized.\n\n1470\n01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:17,710\nThere's the little flash drive and\nthe stuff that I've got on there.\n\n1471\n01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:18,420\n>> Steam.\n\n1472\n01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,330\n>> Yep, there's the Steam installer.\n\n1473\n01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:21,520\nAll right.\n\n1474\n01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,960\nNow to control access the devices, right?\n\n1475\n01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,950\nSo we're going to be back\nin the local group policy.\n\n1476\n01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:31,330\nAnd of course it can all be done domain,\nwhich typically it would be.\n\n1477\n01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:40,360\nSo in there under Computer Configuration,\nAdministrative Templates system\n\n1478\n01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:45,480\ndevice installation, and device\ninstallation restrictions, all right?\n\n1479\n01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:52,038\nSo in through here, there are a number\nof little settings in here, right?\n\n1480\n01:08:52,038 --> 01:08:58,320\nThere's a few in here, but\nthe one that we're gonna do is\n\n1481\n01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:03,240\nPrevent installation of devices\nthat match any of these device IDs.\n\n1482\n01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,850\n>> Okay.\n>> Now that is to\n\n1483\n01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,860\nlock down a specific device.\n\n1484\n01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,435\n>> A vendor or a manufacturer?\n\n1485\n01:09:11,435 --> 01:09:12,810\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n1486\n01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:16,675\n>> Like Kingston thumb drives but not-\n>> AData, G Skill.\n\n1487\n01:09:16,675 --> 01:09:18,220\n>> Right.\n\n1488\n01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,640\nNow there's a similar one\nup here that prevents.\n\n1489\n01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,020\nOh, so I'll go off.\n\n1490\n01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:25,080\nSo right above the blue one.\n\n1491\n01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,830\nPrevent installation of devices using\ndrivers that match any of these device\n\n1492\n01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,840\nsetup classes.\n\n1493\n01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:36,250\nNow, the classes is to shut\ndown a whole class of items.\n\n1494\n01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,770\nSo Bluetooth devices.\n\n1495\n01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:41,140\nOr thumb drives altogether.\n\n1496\n01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:45,144\nAnd now each device will have a GUID.\n\n1497\n01:09:45,144 --> 01:09:47,570\nA G-U-I-D.\n\n1498\n01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:48,400\nDo you remember what it stands for?\n\n1499\n01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,860\n>> Big fancy term there.\n\n1500\n01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,940\nA globally unique identifier.\n\n1501\n01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:54,801\n>> Oh, that's good.\n\n1502\n01:09:54,801 --> 01:09:56,717\nEvery device will have one.\n\n1503\n01:09:56,717 --> 01:09:58,000\n>> Right.\n\n1504\n01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,470\n>> So you can look it up on the Internet\nof whatnot and find each devices GUID.\n\n1505\n01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,390\nAnd you plug that GUID in.\n\n1506\n01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:08,300\n>> But that can be a tedious process,\nright?\n\n1507\n01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,435\nIf we wanted to block every\nsingle thumb drive and\n\n1508\n01:10:11,435 --> 01:10:14,810\nI've got to bo get this GUID for\neach of the different vendors, and\n\n1509\n01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:18,530\nthere's some I've never\nheard of that are out there.\n\n1510\n01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,420\nThat could take some time and be tedious,\nand then we'd miss some and so\n\n1511\n01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,780\nthose thumb drivers are still allowed.\n\n1512\n01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:26,347\nAnd then you get the end user calling up,\nwell how come Bob can use his thumb drive,\n\n1513\n01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,599\nI can't use my thumb drive.\n\n1514\n01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:30,711\nSo a lot of times we'll do\nmore by the class ID where\n\n1515\n01:10:30,711 --> 01:10:33,833\nwe can block the entire\ncategory of thumb drives.\n\n1516\n01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:35,504\n>> Yup, all right so\n\n1517\n01:10:35,504 --> 01:10:40,970\nin here not configured is\nthings just aren't being used.\n\n1518\n01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:45,580\nEnable the rule, so\nenforce the rule, or disabled.\n\n1519\n01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,980\nWhich depending on the wording,\n\n1520\n01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,290\nin this case disabled would be\nthe same as not configured?\n\n1521\n01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,050\n>> Yeah, I'm sure we'll talk much more\nabout that when we get into our group\n\n1522\n01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,580\npolicy session, but you do have to\nwatch the double negatives in there,\n\n1523\n01:10:57,580 --> 01:11:03,720\nbecause disabling prevent insulation\nwould actually enable insulation, right?\n\n1524\n01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,915\nIt would be allowing installation.\n\n1525\n01:11:05,935 --> 01:11:07,915\nAnd we would use that a lot\nof times when I want to\n\n1526\n01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,305\nblock most of my users from\nusing these thumb drives.\n\n1527\n01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:14,435\nBut the guys down in R and D,\nthey have to be able to use thumb drives.\n\n1528\n01:11:14,435 --> 01:11:15,255\nSo I can turn around and\n\n1529\n01:11:15,255 --> 01:11:18,280\nmake a separate policy that would\noverride the one that blocks.\n\n1530\n01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,952\nBut, we will save that for\nour group policy show.\n\n1531\n01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:26,800\n>> So, it's extremely configurable\nin what your company is after.\n\n1532\n01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:28,660\nAnd, alright, so yeah.\n\n1533\n01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,390\nSo, we'll just leave that there.\n\n1534\n01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,320\nClick Cancel.\n\n1535\n01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,625\nNow, alright, so yeah.\n\n1536\n01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:35,530\nSo there's, so, right above the blue one,\n\n1537\n01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:40,630\nwe have allow installation devices using\ndrivers that match these subclasses,\n\n1538\n01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,240\nso, we could go about controlling\naccess in two different ways.\n\n1539\n01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:49,143\nWe could block everything and\nthen use the one just above here, allow.\n\n1540\n01:11:49,143 --> 01:11:50,398\nAnd allow just certain ones.\n\n1541\n01:11:50,398 --> 01:11:52,910\nOr, we could allow everything,\n\n1542\n01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:57,223\nwhich it's By default and\nthen just block certain ones.\n\n1543\n01:11:57,223 --> 01:12:01,976\n>> We might have company-issued\nthumb drives that are more secure\n\n1544\n01:12:01,976 --> 01:12:07,000\nthat support encryption and,\nI don't know, thumb print access.\n\n1545\n01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,570\nHave you seen the thumb drives that\nactually have the thumb prints getting\n\n1546\n01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:10,280\nbuilt onto them?\n\n1547\n01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:10,960\nYeah.\n\n1548\n01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,070\nSo maybe we want to\nblock most thumb drives.\n\n1549\n01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:16,240\nBut those company-issued,\nhighly secured thumb drives are allowed.\n\n1550\n01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,908\nSo we could set up something where\nwe allow that particular class.\n\n1551\n01:12:18,908 --> 01:12:23,533\n>> Mm-hm, or\ncould allow just 256MB thumb drives.\n\n1552\n01:12:23,533 --> 01:12:27,191\n>> Yeah, nothing big enough to\nhold an entire virtual hard drive.\n\n1553\n01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:28,720\n[LAUGH]\n>> If you can find one,\n\n1554\n01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,201\nthen you can use it.\n\n1555\n01:12:30,201 --> 01:12:31,158\nSix for a dollar.\n\n1556\n01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:32,940\n>> [LAUGH] Six for a dollar.\n\n1557\n01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,370\n>> All right.\n\n1558\n01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:37,100\nSo what we're gonna do for this example\n\n1559\n01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:41,900\nis prevent installation of devices\nthat match any of these device IDs.\n\n1560\n01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,320\nNow the first step is to get\nthe ID of my thumb drive.\n\n1561\n01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,805\n>> That would be the trick, right?\n\n1562\n01:12:46,805 --> 01:12:47,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1563\n01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:51,512\nAnd to do that,\nI believe we go in through here.\n\n1564\n01:12:51,512 --> 01:12:56,015\nWe can click on this,\nthis is the thumb drive.\n\n1565\n01:12:56,015 --> 01:12:59,805\n>> Right-click on that thumb drive,\npull up its Properties,\n\n1566\n01:12:59,805 --> 01:13:01,825\nhead over to that Hardware tab.\n\n1567\n01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:10,690\nAnd in Properties and in here,\nright, and we've got the Details tab.\n\n1568\n01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:15,360\nAnd the Details tab right there,\nwe'll just click on it, as I explain it.\n\n1569\n01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,770\nThere's a whole slew of\ndifferent things that\n\n1570\n01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,490\ndescribe this particular drive itself.\n\n1571\n01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:23,970\n>> That you never knew existed and\nprobably don't care.\n\n1572\n01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,070\nBut when you are setting\nup a policy like this,\n\n1573\n01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:27,300\nall of a sudden it becomes very important.\n\n1574\n01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:30,401\n>> And\nthe one that we're after is Hardware.\n\n1575\n01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:31,450\n>> Hardware ID, how about that?\n\n1576\n01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:32,710\n>> Hardware ID.\n\n1577\n01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:35,600\nAnd there's a few, now.\n\n1578\n01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,430\nUSB devices are a little tricky to\ncompletely shut things down in, and\n\n1579\n01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:44,230\nthey rely on a lot of other services.\n\n1580\n01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:48,490\nAnd now I believe we can\njust pick just one of these.\n\n1581\n01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,820\nOne of these will identify this device.\n\n1582\n01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:51,570\n>> Correct.\n\n1583\n01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,470\n>> And lock it down.\n\n1584\n01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:56,760\n>> That to me is saying\nthat that particular device\n\n1585\n01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,100\nthrows all of those IDs out.\n\n1586\n01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,270\n>> So we're gonna choose just this one,\nKingston Data Traveler,\n\n1587\n01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,480\nthat's pretty specific.\n\n1588\n01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,470\nAll right,so I right-clicked on that and\nI chose Copy.\n\n1589\n01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:09,738\nWe're going to come back to our policy,\ndouble-click on it and\n\n1590\n01:14:09,738 --> 01:14:11,200\nhere's the little policy.\n\n1591\n01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,740\nWe will click enable to\nallow us to write down here.\n\n1592\n01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,440\nAnd click on the show button.\n\n1593\n01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,930\nAnd this is where we enter in the values,\nright?\n\n1594\n01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:24,180\nSo the device IDs that we\nwant to turn off, right?\n\n1595\n01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:31,290\nAnd we'll just paste that in and\nwe'll click OK, and click Apply.\n\n1596\n01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:33,830\nThere we go.\n\n1597\n01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:34,580\nOh wait.\n\n1598\n01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:35,510\nOops.\n>> No, go ahead.\n\n1599\n01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:36,230\n>> You want me go back in there?\n\n1600\n01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:38,380\n>> Well let's just see.\n\n1601\n01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,800\nLet's get it go on and see how it goes.\n\n1602\n01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,330\nI'm thinking.\n\n1603\n01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:46,320\nLet's just wait and see.\n\n1604\n01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,950\n>> Man, now you're the one\nthat's [CROSSTALK] something.\n\n1605\n01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,450\n>> Paybacks are you know what.\n\n1606\n01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:51,480\n>> [LAUGH] Man.\n\n1607\n01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:52,825\n>> And Jason,\nyou didn't have to believe that one.\n\n1608\n01:14:52,825 --> 01:14:56,720\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1609\n01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,340\nSo you got your ID,\nyou got your policy created.\n\n1610\n01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,585\n>> Yep, and yeah.\n\n1611\n01:15:00,585 --> 01:15:04,075\n>> [CROSSTALK] It's still there, isn't it?\n\n1612\n01:15:04,075 --> 01:15:04,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1613\n01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,730\nCould we access it?\n\n1614\n01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:07,040\nSure enough.\n\n1615\n01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:07,615\n>> Sure enough.\n\n1616\n01:15:07,615 --> 01:15:08,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1617\n01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,241\nAll right, Mike.\n\n1618\n01:15:09,241 --> 01:15:10,700\nSo it is there.\n\n1619\n01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,030\n>> Well we've got a couple of things.\n\n1620\n01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:16,160\nOne, probably that\nthe policy was just changed.\n\n1621\n01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,420\nSo if you were watching\nour previous episodes,\n\n1622\n01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:20,890\nwhat do we have to do any time\nwe make a change to a policy?\n\n1623\n01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,740\nI heard somebody say it out there.\n\n1624\n01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,025\nWe have to update that policy.\n\n1625\n01:15:26,025 --> 01:15:29,900\n[LAUGH] We need some live\nfeedback from you guys here.\n\n1626\n01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,070\nYeah, any time you make\na change to a policy you've got\n\n1627\n01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,920\nto make sure that policy's applied.\n\n1628\n01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,103\nIn a corporate environment,\nin the real world,\n\n1629\n01:15:39,103 --> 01:15:41,617\nif we're not in any hurry we\ndon't have to do anything.\n\n1630\n01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:46,960\nBecause we know within 90 to 120 minutes\nthose policies are going to be reapplied.\n\n1631\n01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,410\nBut when you're testing things\nout on a live show like this.\n\n1632\n01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:53,200\n[SOUND] We don't really want to\nwait around 90 to 120 minutes.\n\n1633\n01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,350\nSo we do a little GP update.\n\n1634\n01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,680\nAll right so we've refreshed policy.\n\n1635\n01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,616\nStill there.\n\n1636\n01:15:59,866 --> 01:16:00,860\nWhat the heck?\n\n1637\n01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:05,175\nNow I believe in this one, right?\n\n1638\n01:16:05,175 --> 01:16:08,263\nDouble-click on it, there is a little\noption down here in the bottom,\n\n1639\n01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,450\nis that you were thinking?\n\n1640\n01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:10,033\n>> He did see that.\n\n1641\n01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:11,101\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I thought maybe he missed that one.\n\n1642\n01:16:11,101 --> 01:16:11,601\n>> Oh yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1643\n01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:14,558\n>> Yes, I win, yay.\n\n1644\n01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:15,350\nAll right, high score.\n\n1645\n01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:16,860\n>> There's still one more I'm holding in\n\n1646\n01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,145\nmy back pocket there.\nWe'll see\n\n1647\n01:16:18,145 --> 01:16:18,990\nif he gets there.\n>> Okay,\n\n1648\n01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:19,600\nsweet.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1649\n01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,196\n>> All right, so\n\n1650\n01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:23,289\na little option right there in the bottom.\nAlso applied two matching\n\n1651\n01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:26,683\ndevices that are already installed.\n>> I think that pretty much covers it.\n\n1652\n01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:28,619\n>> Yup, and I think typically,\n\n1653\n01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:32,141\nthat would be a default option almost?\n>> Yeah, almost.\n\n1654\n01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:36,040\nAs we just saw, although Nate never did\n\n1655\n01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,695\nremove the drive to put it back in.\nBut\n\n1656\n01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:42,627\nonce that thumb drive has\nbeen in that machine,\n\n1657\n01:16:42,627 --> 01:16:47,439\nit's already installed the driver for it.\nIt already recognizes it, so\n\n1658\n01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:52,975\nwe need to make sure we go back and block\nthose that have already been installed.\n\n1659\n01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:57,033\n>> Nice.\n\n1660\n01:16:57,033 --> 01:16:57,533\nAll right.\n\n1661\n01:16:57,533 --> 01:16:59,330\n>> So let's see what happens now.\n\n1662\n01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:01,610\nI think he might have got it.\n\n1663\n01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:02,796\nDog, I thought I might have\nhad him on the [INAUDIBLE]\n\n1664\n01:17:02,796 --> 01:17:03,327\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, man.\n\n1665\n01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:04,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was good.\n\n1666\n01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,540\nSee, I did my homework.\n\n1667\n01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1668\n01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:08,490\nHuh.\nLook at that.\n\n1669\n01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,100\n>> It's gone.\n\n1670\n01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:09,810\nHow about that?\n\n1671\n01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:10,440\n>> It's gone.\n\n1672\n01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:18,520\n>> Now what if you remove it from\nthe machine and then we plug it back in.\n\n1673\n01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,200\n>> All right, let's plug it back in.\n\n1674\n01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,288\n>> And we expect to see our\nlittle installing driver.\n\n1675\n01:17:23,288 --> 01:17:24,866\nOr no.\n\n1676\n01:17:27,158 --> 01:17:30,316\n>> Here, I'm gonna pull it back out, and\n\n1677\n01:17:30,316 --> 01:17:34,825\nlet me turn up the speakers\non the little computer here.\n\n1678\n01:17:34,825 --> 01:17:35,575\n>> Lean real close to it.\n\n1679\n01:17:35,575 --> 01:17:39,890\n>> [LAUGH] You can come over\nto my side if you want.\n\n1680\n01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:41,520\n>> I don't know if my cord's that long.\n\n1681\n01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,340\nCan I get over there?\n\n1682\n01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:44,417\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1683\n01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:45,908\n>> [SOUND] Oh, I heard that.\n\n1684\n01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:47,616\nI don't know if you guys could\nhear that out in TV land.\n\n1685\n01:17:49,825 --> 01:17:53,700\n>> So it [SOUND] recognized\nit was being plugged in.\n\n1686\n01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,260\n>> It says, hey,\na new device has been found.\n\n1687\n01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,400\nBut yet nothing is showing up.\n\n1688\n01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,826\n>> It's not gonna do anything about it.\n\n1689\n01:17:58,826 --> 01:18:00,545\n>> No.\n>> Nope.\n\n1690\n01:18:00,545 --> 01:18:03,310\n>> We broke it, but in a good way.\n\n1691\n01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:04,158\nYeah, in a good way.\n\n1692\n01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:05,960\n>> In an intentional way.\n\n1693\n01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,504\n>> So, there we go, now we have locked\ndown every Kingston Data Traveler thumb\n\n1694\n01:18:10,504 --> 01:18:13,950\ndrive, then, based off of its device ID.\n\n1695\n01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,450\nAnd now we cannot run any of those.\n\n1696\n01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,450\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1697\n01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:17,950\n>> Wait, what?\n\n1698\n01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:23,760\n>> We showed one particular brand\nof thumb drive that we blocked, but\n\n1699\n01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,580\nthe same concept would apply,\nif I wanted to do all thumb drives.\n\n1700\n01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,325\nAnd you gotta be careful with USB.\n\n1701\n01:18:29,325 --> 01:18:33,021\nI mean, there is a lot of\nstuff that we use USB for,\n\n1702\n01:18:33,021 --> 01:18:36,284\nand I don't wanna just\nblock half my mouse.\n\n1703\n01:18:36,284 --> 01:18:39,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> My Ethernet adapter here on this\n\n1704\n01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,130\nlittle laptop.\n\n1705\n01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,710\nIt was all USB based so\nwe do have to be careful.\n\n1706\n01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:46,670\nWe cannot just block USB in general,\nright?\n\n1707\n01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:48,310\nOr we might have some issues.\n\n1708\n01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:54,035\nA lot of times, your card readers and\nthings like that might connect via USB.\n\n1709\n01:18:54,035 --> 01:18:56,850\nThe policy, those settings in there,\n\n1710\n01:18:56,850 --> 01:19:01,020\ngive us the ability to block\ncertain classes of devices.\n\n1711\n01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:07,040\nBlock particular device IDs, or\nbe more general and block USB together.\n\n1712\n01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,350\nBut like I said, usually we want\nto be more specific with that.\n\n1713\n01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:11,980\n>> So\nyou know what I'm gonna use mine for?\n\n1714\n01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,080\n>> What?\n>> Locking down USB.\n\n1715\n01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:16,265\nIs I'm going to block all the gamepads.\n\n1716\n01:19:16,265 --> 01:19:17,140\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1717\n01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:19,865\n>> The only thing I'm going to allow\nis the one where there's one stick.\n\n1718\n01:19:19,865 --> 01:19:20,531\n>> Wait, my Xbox controller?\n\n1719\n01:19:20,531 --> 01:19:21,798\n>> And one button.\n>> How am I gonna\n\n1720\n01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:25,033\nbeat your high score without\nmy Xbox controller man?\n\n1721\n01:19:25,033 --> 01:19:25,657\n>> There we go.\n\n1722\n01:19:25,657 --> 01:19:27,575\nWe'll shut all those down.\n\n1723\n01:19:27,575 --> 01:19:30,630\n>> I do still have my\n2600 joystick though.\n\n1724\n01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:35,270\nWe could probably re-wire that thing for\nUSB.\n\n1725\n01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,410\nThat's another show.\n\n1726\n01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:37,960\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n1727\n01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:39,110\nAll right, see ya.\n\n1728\n01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:43,151\n>> So we locked it down.\nNow there's one other place of\n\n1729\n01:19:43,151 --> 01:19:46,850\ncontrolling access to stuff and\n\n1730\n01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:53,022\nthat is media on removable drives,\nstuff, things.\n\n1731\n01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:55,020\nAll right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1732\n01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,680\n>> Now that one might like-\n\n1733\n01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,851\n>> Like the media as in DVDs or\n\n1734\n01:19:58,851 --> 01:20:01,880\nCD-ROMs and things like that.\n\n1735\n01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,440\nYes, removable media.\n\n1736\n01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,460\nVersus removable storage.\n\n1737\n01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,470\n>> Correct, yeah.\n\n1738\n01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:07,895\nNow in that-\n>> So we can block that too.\n\n1739\n01:20:07,895 --> 01:20:09,450\nMm-hm, oh yeah.\n\n1740\n01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:13,330\n>> Because I could steal data just as\neasily with a writable DVD, right?\n\n1741\n01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:16,720\n>> Yeah, or put it in your Discman\nas you go out and then boy,\n\n1742\n01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,600\nit's just Britney Spears CD.\n\n1743\n01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,190\n>> Did he say Discman?\n\n1744\n01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,490\n>> Discman mm-hm, you got one?\n\n1745\n01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,020\n>> No, not anymore\n>> Oh, right.\n\n1746\n01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,286\n>> I think the door fell off.\n\n1747\n01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:27,680\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1748\n01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:28,760\nHey, I kid.\n\n1749\n01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,448\nThis next one\n>> Close that bag phone,\n\n1750\n01:20:31,448 --> 01:20:33,202\nalways the bag phone.\n\n1751\n01:20:33,202 --> 01:20:34,757\nYou should find one.\n\n1752\n01:20:34,757 --> 01:20:42,210\nAll right now, this one Mike is in another\nplace of removable storage access.\n\n1753\n01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:44,100\n>> Here go\n>> So\n\n1754\n01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,470\n>> Scroll back up.\n\n1755\n01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:49,560\nSo you're still under the same computer,\nadministrative templates, system.\n\n1756\n01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:58,060\nAnd instead of device installation,\nwe're going to removable storage access.\n\n1757\n01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:02,300\nWhich sounds a lot like removable storage,\nnot removable media.\n\n1758\n01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,410\nSo you got to watch the terminology here.\n\n1759\n01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:05,576\nIt can be a little confusing.\n\n1760\n01:21:05,576 --> 01:21:11,510\nYep, still really similar.\n\n1761\n01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:16,410\nNow in here, this XPS that I'm\n\n1762\n01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:21,195\nrunning now does not has a DVD-ROM,\nCD-ROM, nothing like that built into it.\n\n1763\n01:21:21,195 --> 01:21:25,610\nWe won't run any demos.\n\n1764\n01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:27,690\n>> Can't really do a demo for this.\n\n1765\n01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:30,340\nIt is kinda off,\nwell not really off topic, but\n\n1766\n01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,760\nit is amazing now that\nthe majority of our laptops,\n\n1767\n01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,690\ntrying to thin them down, slim them up,\nmake them lightweight, no DVD drive.\n\n1768\n01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:41,910\nI thought DVDs would be around forever.\n\n1769\n01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:46,540\nBut with solid state and thumb drives,\nthey are slowly fading away.\n\n1770\n01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,700\n>> That and the cloud.\n\n1771\n01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,520\n>> It's just out there, floating.\n\n1772\n01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,440\n>> Whatever you want is on the internet.\n\n1773\n01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,400\nFree of charge.\n\n1774\n01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:56,985\nNo.\n\n1775\n01:21:56,985 --> 01:21:58,340\n[LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n1776\n01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,420\n>> With your paid subscription.\n\n1777\n01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,941\n>> That's right.\n\n1778\n01:22:00,941 --> 01:22:03,070\n>> Like Technet.\n\n1779\n01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:04,680\n>> Which is also disappearing.\n\n1780\n01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,290\n>> I know, poor Technet.\n\n1781\n01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:10,170\nI was a little late to\nthe game on Technet.\n\n1782\n01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:12,940\nYeah, awesome service\nprovided by Microsoft.\n\n1783\n01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,810\n>> Fantastic.\n\n1784\n01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:17,128\n>> And real sweet for\nthe test stuff, right?\n\n1785\n01:22:17,128 --> 01:22:20,180\nTestlabs and experimenting.\n\n1786\n01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,480\n>> Again, the Cloud.\n\n1787\n01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,750\nIt's being replaced.\n\n1788\n01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:25,540\nInstead of downloading\nISO's of the software and\n\n1789\n01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,900\nthen creating my own\nvirtual test environment.\n\n1790\n01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:32,210\nAnd to work with these new products that\nMicrosoft's putting out or what have you.\n\n1791\n01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:34,650\nWe now go to their\ncloud-based services and\n\n1792\n01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:38,800\nwe run virtual machines on their cloud\ninfrastructure to test the product.\n\n1793\n01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,330\nWhich obviously helps with licensing\nissues and piracy of the software and\n\n1794\n01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,950\nthings like that.\n\n1795\n01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:50,170\nSo, it is nice, it's a change which all of\nus are usually a little against at first,\n\n1796\n01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:53,010\nbut I think it will be\na good thing in the end.\n\n1797\n01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:53,970\nAs long as it's still available.\n\n1798\n01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:58,240\n>> All right, so yeah,\nbringing it all back.\n\n1799\n01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,950\nAll right,\nsome of the policies in here, right?\n\n1800\n01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:06,820\nLet's see, here's this one\nhighlighted here, CD and DVD.\n\n1801\n01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,060\nDeny read access, right?\n\n1802\n01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,540\nSo we can put a DVD in and\nit can't, won't read.\n\n1803\n01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:13,530\nYeah.\nCan't read it.\n\n1804\n01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,890\nWon't play.\n\n1805\n01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,730\nHere's a write access.\n\n1806\n01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:17,880\n>> Probably a good one to use, you know,\n\n1807\n01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:22,870\nif you're trying to prevent data theft,\nsomebody is writing data to a DVD.\n\n1808\n01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:28,590\nMaybe you want them to read DVDs,\nbut not write their own.\n\n1809\n01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:33,590\n>> We've got floppy drives,\nright, floppy drives.\n\n1810\n01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:36,230\n>> Because I know everybody out there\nstill has a computer with a floppy\n\n1811\n01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:37,180\ndrive on it.\n\n1812\n01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:40,030\nSo we gotta make sure we block those,\nbecause you can steal,\n\n1813\n01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:43,300\nyou could get up to\n1.44 megabytes of data.\n\n1814\n01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,300\n>> Imagine, yeah.\n\n1815\n01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:49,547\nYou could get like a-\n>> An entire spreadsheet.\n\n1816\n01:23:49,547 --> 01:23:52,447\nMaybe even a whole word document.\n\n1817\n01:23:52,447 --> 01:23:55,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was going to say like a jpeg.\n\n1818\n01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,720\nEven some of those.\n\n1819\n01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,090\nIt can get pretty big.\n\n1820\n01:23:58,090 --> 01:23:59,110\nIt can.\n\n1821\n01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:04,740\n>> But, in all seriousness,\nyou can say that?\n\n1822\n01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:11,440\nIf the machine still had a floppy drive on\nit, very easy way to introduce Malware.\n\n1823\n01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,460\nBecause our biases still\ncan be set to look for\n\n1824\n01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:17,360\nthat floppy drive,\nautomatically boot to it,\n\n1825\n01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,430\nany number of ways I could introduce\nMalware if you've got a floppy drive.\n\n1826\n01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:26,370\nSo, in places where I've got older\nhardware that we've been able to\n\n1827\n01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:31,980\nextend the lifetime on it, we've been able\nto upgrade it and continue to use it.\n\n1828\n01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,170\nPainfully, but it's still running.\n\n1829\n01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:36,890\nAnd it still has a floppy drive.\n\n1830\n01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:38,990\nI might want to be able to a copy.\n\n1831\n01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:41,670\nWe have portable floppys too.\n\n1832\n01:24:41,670 --> 01:24:45,460\nSo we could potentially see\nsomebody thinking ha ha ha,\n\n1833\n01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:50,950\nthey've blocked DVD and USB drives,\nbut I bet they didn't block floppies,\n\n1834\n01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:54,225\nso I'm breaking out my portable\nfloppy disk, and pow, I'm in there!\n\n1835\n01:24:54,225 --> 01:24:56,000\n>> [LAUGH] Pop that sucker in.\n\n1836\n01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:56,990\n>> Yeah man.\n\n1837\n01:24:56,990 --> 01:24:57,650\n>> Sweet.\n40 bucks.\n\n1838\n01:24:57,650 --> 01:24:58,390\nBest Buy.\n\n1839\n01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,210\n>> Yeah?\n>> I think, something like that\n\n1840\n01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:00,880\nlast time I looked.\n\n1841\n01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,570\nIt was a few disks ago.\n\n1842\n01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,030\n>> All right.\nWhat were you looking for a floppy for?\n\n1843\n01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:05,650\n>> They were probably free.\n\n1844\n01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:07,850\nWell you know, honestly,\n\n1845\n01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:12,860\nin my work environment where I have to\nset up a lot of classroom machines,\n\n1846\n01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:18,070\nI had these floppy disks that I used, that\nI would just throw in there, reboot, and\n\n1847\n01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:22,560\nthey would wipe the drive, create my\npartitions, format my partitions.\n\n1848\n01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,820\nAnd then all I had to do was\ncome back five minutes later and\n\n1849\n01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,980\ninstall my operating system.\n\n1850\n01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:27,430\nSo they were really handy.\n\n1851\n01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:31,795\nCuz I had a stack of disks and\nI would just [NOISE] down the row,\n\n1852\n01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:33,116\nreboot them all.\n\n1853\n01:25:33,116 --> 01:25:34,280\nIt was easy to do.\n\n1854\n01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,890\n>> Oh yeah, like.\n\n1855\n01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,680\n>> Yeah man.\n[LAUGH] Like six shooters.\n\n1856\n01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,969\nBut yeah.\n\n1857\n01:25:38,969 --> 01:25:39,480\n>> Sweet.\n\n1858\n01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,712\nI'd like to see that.\n\n1859\n01:25:40,712 --> 01:25:41,560\n>> USB.\n\n1860\n01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,760\nAnd you think about it,\nI could do it with a USB,\n\n1861\n01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,490\nbut do I want to carry around\n20 USB drives, plug one each in.\n\n1862\n01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,640\nFloppies were convenient.\n\n1863\n01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,990\nI still have my, we won't go there.\n\n1864\n01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:52,590\nUpdate myself here.\n\n1865\n01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:53,472\n>> Right on.\n\n1866\n01:25:53,472 --> 01:25:57,240\nAll right,\nwell we're right up on break time.\n\n1867\n01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,750\nAnd so yeah, there we go.\n\n1868\n01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,410\nControlling access to hardware.\n\n1869\n01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:04,805\nAnd when we get back we gonna\nmove away from hardware, and\n\n1870\n01:26:04,805 --> 01:26:07,937\nget into the wonderful\nworld of Internet Explorer.\n\n1871\n01:26:07,937 --> 01:26:09,237\n>> Everybody's favorite browser.\n\n1872\n01:26:09,237 --> 01:26:10,363\n>> Everybody's favorite browser.\n>> Stay tuned.\n\n1873\n01:26:10,363 --> 01:26:12,209\n>> See you then.\n\n1874\n01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:16,257\n[SOUND] And welcome back for\n\n1875\n01:26:16,257 --> 01:26:21,961\nthe last segment in our episode today\n\n1876\n01:26:21,961 --> 01:26:27,490\non controlling hardware and apps.\n\n1877\n01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:32,000\nSo now we are going to move\ninto Internet Explorer.\n\n1878\n01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,740\nNow we won't be controlling,\nstarting Internet Explorer,\n\n1879\n01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:41,530\nbut we will control just\ncertain aspects of Explorer.\n\n1880\n01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:46,280\nAnd harden it a little bit.\n\n1881\n01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,560\n>> Really for the exam we're going to need\nto know some of the different options that\n\n1882\n01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,540\nwe can configure in Internet Explorer.\n\n1883\n01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:55,370\nIn a corporate environment where\nwe're wanting to control many things.\n\n1884\n01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:57,315\nLike what web pages they're going to.\n\n1885\n01:26:57,315 --> 01:27:02,860\nWhat add ons are allowed to run,\nand things like that.\n\n1886\n01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:05,920\nSo we'll go through some of the different\nsettings that we can configure\n\n1887\n01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,999\nin Internet Explorer.\n\n1888\n01:27:07,999 --> 01:27:10,110\n>> Yep, yeah, sounds good.\n\n1889\n01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:12,460\n>> I like it.\n>> Now Internet Explorer, right, so\n\n1890\n01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,420\nsomething that's new to Windows 8, right,\n\n1891\n01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:20,440\nis that Internet Explorer has\ntwo different Interfaces, right?\n\n1892\n01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:27,272\nSo we have the desktop interface and\nwe have the modern UI style interface.\n\n1893\n01:27:27,272 --> 01:27:31,190\nAll right, so\nthe desktop interface, right,\n\n1894\n01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:35,918\nassuming that we're all-\n>> Yeah, that's what we use every day,\n\n1895\n01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:39,238\nas long as you're using Internet Explorer.\n\n1896\n01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:42,098\nBut that's the version\nthat we're familiar with,\n\n1897\n01:27:42,098 --> 01:27:45,682\nthe big blue e that's on our desktop or\non our taskbar down there.\n\n1898\n01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:46,680\nWe click on that.\n\n1899\n01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,363\nWe launch Internet Explorer.\n\n1900\n01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:51,568\nStandard desktop based application.\n\n1901\n01:27:51,568 --> 01:27:54,480\n>> Let's bring that up.\n\n1902\n01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,610\nLet's show them.\n\n1903\n01:27:56,610 --> 01:28:01,760\n>> Let's see if we can pull\nup Internet Explorer there.\n\n1904\n01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,598\nAnd I think we've all probably seen that\nat least once or twice before, right?\n\n1905\n01:28:05,598 --> 01:28:08,695\nAt least opened up, closed it,\nand installed Chrome.\n\n1906\n01:28:08,695 --> 01:28:12,330\n>> [LAUGH] Man, man, Mike.\n\n1907\n01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:14,050\n>> No, it's a really good browser.\n\n1908\n01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:15,720\nIt's one of my favorite browsers.\n\n1909\n01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,050\nNo, I am not a browser snob.\n\n1910\n01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:20,820\nI will tell you that I use whatever\nbrowser is on the computer.\n\n1911\n01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:25,620\nI know many people are very strongly\nopinionated about their browsers.\n\n1912\n01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:29,390\nAnd to the point where they\nrefused to use certain browsers.\n\n1913\n01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,818\nThey will go to anybody's machine.\n\n1914\n01:28:30,818 --> 01:28:33,025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not even their own machine.\n\n1915\n01:28:33,025 --> 01:28:37,170\nAnd download a different browser and\ninstall it because they refuse to.\n\n1916\n01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:38,280\nThe internet's the internet.\n\n1917\n01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,455\nI don't care what browser I used\nto get there, to be honest.\n\n1918\n01:28:40,455 --> 01:28:42,195\n>> But yeah.\n\n1919\n01:28:42,195 --> 01:28:44,130\n>> Some people have their preferences.\n\n1920\n01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:46,560\nSo anyway, back to what we've gonna know.\n\n1921\n01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,488\nSo that was the standard and\nthen there's the new for\n\n1922\n01:28:51,488 --> 01:28:54,962\nthe, the new Windows 8 interface.\n\n1923\n01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:58,921\nWe have an Internet Explorer version for\nthat as well.\n\n1924\n01:28:58,921 --> 01:29:01,103\nAnd we get to that through here,\nright Mike?\n\n1925\n01:29:01,103 --> 01:29:03,927\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> And\n\n1926\n01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:07,493\nwhat have you done to your computer?\n\n1927\n01:29:07,493 --> 01:29:09,073\nYou've disabled it.\n\n1928\n01:29:09,073 --> 01:29:12,650\n>> Let's go to all

the browser,\n\n1940\n01:29:41,804 --> 01:29:45,150\njust like any other of the new interfaces.\n\n1941\n01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:47,310\nNo address bar across the top, right?\n\n1942\n01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:49,210\nNo close buttons.\n\n1943\n01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:51,050\nFull screened interface.\n\n1944\n01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:52,330\nBut it's still the same browser.\n\n1945\n01:29:52,330 --> 01:29:59,550\nIn fact, we were just verifying it's\nversion 10.9200, so, same version.\n\n1946\n01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:00,555\n>> All right.\n\n1947\n01:30:00,555 --> 01:30:03,637\nYep.\nSo, Well I guess it works out kinda\n\n1948\n01:30:03,637 --> 01:30:08,966\nconveniently because for the exam and\nfor our demonstrations today,\n\n1949\n01:30:08,966 --> 01:30:15,032\nwe will be focusing on the desktop version\nor desktop GUI of Internet Explorer.\n\n1950\n01:30:15,032 --> 01:30:16,195\n>> Yep.\n\n1951\n01:30:16,195 --> 01:30:17,900\n>> So-\n>> Which I still prefer,\n\n1952\n01:30:17,900 -->

which one you prefer.\n\n1955\n01:30:23,741 --> 01:30:25,599\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I am the same way,\n\n1956\n01:30:25,599 --> 01:30:27,301\nI'll be on my Start screen.\n\n1957\n01:30:27,301 -->

Yea, let's go over\nsome of this the next year so.\n\n1962\n01:30:43,374 --> 01:30:45,348\nYep, now I, yes so\nInternet Explorer right?\n\n1963\n01:30:45,348 --> 01:30:49,420\nYou think, it's just a browser.\n\n1964\n01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:54,290\nWell there's a lot of things to\nconfigure it in the browser.\n\n1965\n01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:59,340\nThere's internet, it.\n\n1966\n01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:02,562\nWhat?\nYeah, like Internet options and\n\n1967\n01:31:02,562 --> 01:31:07,270\nthrough policy stuff, there's-\n>> There's a lot to configure.\n\n1968\n01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,460\nAnd because it's a very common\navenue of attack, right?\n\n1969\n01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:17,740\nIt's a very easy way for, users browse\nto bad websites and they click on links.\n\n1970\n01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:21,400\nAnd things are gonna get installed on the\nmachine, possibly infecting my machines or\n\n1971\n01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,990\nmy entire network.\n\n1972\n01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:27,550\nSo it is something that we have to secure,\none to keep my network safe,\n\n1973\n01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:34,300\nto keep those, machines safe, and also\nto control where they're going, right?\n\n1974\n01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:38,040\nWe don't need them browsing Amazon.com\nall day long when they're supposed to be\n\n1975\n01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:40,280\nworking or spending their day on eBay,\n\n1976\n01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,782\ntrying to do their auction sniping or\nwhatever the heck they're doing.\n\n1977\n01:31:44,782 --> 01:31:46,778\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You gotta be able to lock that\n\n1978\n01:31:46,778 --> 01:31:47,644\nvideo down.\n\n1979\n01:31:47,644 --> 01:31:49,885\n>> If they're not on Steam\nthen they're on eBay.\n\n1980\n01:31:49,885 --> 01:31:50,433\n>> That's right.\n\n1981\n01:31:50,433 --> 01:31:55,835\nThey beat my high score and I'll be darned\nif they beat my bid by three seconds.\n\n1982\n01:31:55,835 --> 01:31:58,220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Man, those users.\n\n1983\n01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:58,755\n>> I tell you what.\n\n1984\n01:31:58,755 --> 01:32:01,410\n>> All right.\n\n1985\n01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:03,200\nSo, Internet Explorer, right?\n\n1986\n01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,139\nSo, of the sub-objectives, right?\n\n1987\n01:32:06,139 --> 01:32:12,680\nFor this little bit we've got this\nconfigure compatibility view.\n\n1988\n01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,610\nThere's-\n>> Got good old compatibility view.\n\n1989\n01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:18,040\nI mean, do I daresay?\n\n1990\n01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:22,890\nI mean, you know you're browsers fantastic\nwhen you've got to have a compatibility\n\n1991\n01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:25,720\nview button, to where if it breaks\nthe webpage you're trying to view,\n\n1992\n01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,165\nyou can turn this feature on.\n\n1993\n01:32:27,165 --> 01:32:31,175\n[LAUGH] I don't see that\nin other browsers, do you?\n\n1994\n01:32:31,175 --> 01:32:33,720\n[LAUGH] You know, but yeah.\n\n1995\n01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,240\nInternet Explorer has what's\ncalled compatibility view.\n\n1996\n01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:41,450\nSome pages might not display properly in\nthe latest version of Internet Explorer.\n\n1997\n01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:45,795\nSo in that case, we've got our\ncompatibility view, which is supposed to.\n\n1998\n01:32:45,795 --> 01:32:50,345\nAllow those older webpages or those, I say\nolder but it's not that they're older,\n\n1999\n01:32:50,345 --> 01:32:52,325\nthey're just not designed for IE.\n\n2000\n01:32:53,435 --> 01:32:56,355\nSo IE has a tendency to break things.\n\n2001\n01:32:56,355 --> 01:33:00,070\nCompatibility view is going to allow those\nweb pages to hopefully Play properly.\n\n2002\n01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:03,500\nAnd I think we got an example of\na site that will do just that.\n\n2003\n01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,370\nOr just the opposite actually.\n\n2004\n01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:07,300\n>> Yeah.\n>> We're gonna show you this site that\n\n2005\n01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,340\nhe's getting ready to show you.\n\n2006\n01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:11,490\nActually works fine.\n\n2007\n01:33:11,490 --> 01:33:15,890\nYou turn on compatibility view and\nthat breaks it.\n\n2008\n01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:18,250\n>> Yeah.\nFor our example, right?\n\n2009\n01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:23,040\nSo we've got the Edutainment Live Website.\n\n2010\n01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,730\n>> There it goes.\n\n2011\n01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:26,120\n>> Thank you Jason.\n\n2012\n01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,735\nAnd all right, so yeah,\nso we've got our website.\n\n2013\n01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:32,640\nSo to use our compatibility view,\nor to turn it on, right?\n\n2014\n01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:37,050\nThere's this little folder or\npage Icon up here.\n\n2015\n01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,740\nAnd to turn it on, right.\n\n2016\n01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,100\nWe just click it.\n\n2017\n01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:47,950\nAnd it will refresh the page and\nchange things slightly, right.\n\n2018\n01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:50,620\n>> We'll see a different font on this one,\nI think?\n\n2019\n01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:55,030\n>> Yeah, they do a little work to it.\n\n2020\n01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:58,460\n>> Scroll down a little bit\n>> And if you go, if I remember correctly,\n\n2021\n01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:02,660\nright there all right,, so we look at that\nparagraph, our contents, supplements,\n\n2022\n01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:06,460\ntraditional learning methods, to provide\nyou with a fun and engaging way.\n\n2023\n01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,381\nNow turn off your compatibility view.\n\n2024\n01:34:11,806 --> 01:34:15,018\nAnd it didn't stay there but\nyou can see that the font is slightly\n\n2025\n01:34:15,018 --> 01:34:18,090\ndifferent, it's no longer\n>> The other one looked a little bit\n\n2026\n01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:19,970\nbolder and\nit was a slightly different font.\n\n2027\n01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:24,400\nThat doesn't have anything to do with\nthe functionality of the page but\n\n2028\n01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:29,780\nthat shows us that the compatibility\nview is due at something.\n\n2029\n01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:33,120\nI can't think of another\npage that doesn't work but.\n\n2030\n01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,350\n>> I went out looking for one that.\n\n2031\n01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:40,100\n>> Was like really broken for the example\nbut Internet Explorer did such a great job\n\n2032\n01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:45,927\nrendering everything it was hard to find\none that didn't work out of the box.\n\n2033\n01:34:45,927 --> 01:34:51,350\n>> [LAUGH] ] Would you call\nyourself a Microsoft fanboy?\n\n2034\n01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:54,170\n>> Changing the font is\nas much as I could do.\n\n2035\n01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:57,380\nAnd also, there are some pages that\nyou are gonna go to out there,\n\n2036\n01:34:57,380 --> 01:35:00,840\nthat may have some older\nstyle scripting done on them.\n\n2037\n01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:04,420\nOr some older tags that\nare being depreciated.\n\n2038\n01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:07,280\nAnd the new browsers are just\nnot designed to support those.\n\n2039\n01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,380\nSo, if you get to a page like that,\nand it's broke.\n\n2040\n01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:12,660\nThings don't line up properly.\n\n2041\n01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:14,740\nEverything's all slammed to one side.\n\n2042\n01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:18,580\nPhones don't display it properly or\nstart overlapping a lot of times.\n\n2043\n01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:24,230\nYou turn on your compatibility view and\nthe page renders now\n\n2044\n01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:27,560\n>> Now, there is a group policy setting

settings.\n\n2049\n01:35:43,381 --> 01:35:49,378\nFor every machine out there and if it's\nnot on the global list of checked sites or\n\n2050\n01:35:49,378 --> 01:35:53,690\nwhatnot then we could push\nthat out to all the computers.\n\n2051\n01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:54,190\n>> Exactly.\n\n2052\n01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:57,050\nYeah, for an end user if they\ngo to a particular page and\n\n2053\n01:35:57,050 --> 01:36:00,950\nit's not displaying properly, they can\nclick the little torn page icon and\n\n2054\n01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:02,830\nturn on that compatibility view.\n\n2055\n01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:06,080\nFrom the admin stand point,\nif we know of pages that my\n\n2056\n01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:11,260\nusers are going to be going to as part of\ntheir job and it has a capability issue.\n\n2057\n01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,860\nI can use a group policy to set it so\n\n2058\n01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:17,320\nthat when they go there it's already\nturned into capability view.\n\n2059\n01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,703\nAnd they don't have to click\nthe little torn page icon.\n\n2060\n01:36:19,703 --> 01:36:22,860\n>> Makes it handy.\n\n2061\n01:36:22,860 -->

--> 01:36:32,700\n>> Right?\nSo to get to our security settings, right,\n\n2065\n01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,400\nlittle gear icon up here.\n\n2066\n01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:40,648\nAnd I was thinking at first to go\nthrough and some of these options and\n\n2067\n01:36:40,648 --> 01:36:46,911\neverything, but yeah,\nI guess to stick with our exam objectives.\n\n2068\n01:36:46,911 --> 01:36:48,330\n>> Yeah and there's a lot of options.\n\n2069\n01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:50,230\nWe could sit there and\ngo through all of them but\n\n2070\n01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:52,710\nwhat we want to focus on is\nwhat we need to pass that test.\n\n2071\n01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:56,270\nSo most of our time is going to be\nspent in the Internet Options and\n\n2072\n01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:57,320\nthe on the Security tab.\n\n2073\n01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:01,690\nAnd what we need to know here is how\nInternet Explorer handles security.\n\n2074\n01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,940\nAnd it really divides\nthings up into four zones.\n\n2075\n01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:09,620\nYou've got your Internet,\nyour local intranet,\n\n2076\n01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:13,630\nyour restricted sites and\nyour trusted sites.\n\n2077\n01:37:13,630 --> 01:37:16,600\nI don't know about you, I like to start at\nthe other side and then work my way back.\n\n2078\n01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:23,350\nIf we look at those restricted sites,\nthose are sites that we know are bad...\n\n2079\n01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:27,660\nYou know, that we've had trouble with\nwhere our users have maybe browsed to that\n\n2080\n01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:30,630\npage and picked up some malware,\nsome spyware.\n\n2081\n01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:31,900\nSomething like that.\n\n2082\n01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:34,820\nWe can add those sites to\nour restricted sites and\n\n2083\n01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:36,890\nthat's not going to prevent them\nfrom browsing to it, right?\n\n2084\n01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:40,610\nThis is not proxy,\nwe're not filtering where they're going.\n\n2085\n01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:43,369\nWhat this is going to do is\nwhen they get to that webpage,\n\n2086\n01:37:43,369 --> 01:37:45,620\nrestrict what that\nwebpage is allowed to do.\n\n2087\n01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:46,293\nBy default,\n\n2088\n01:37:46,293 --> 01:37:50,680\nyou guys can see that the slider for\nmy restricted sites is set to high.\n\n2089\n01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,720\nIf I could read that with my old eyes,\n\n2090\n01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:56,220\nit's going to say that it's basically\ngoing to block just about everything.\n\n2091\n01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:00,330\nAny type of scripts or\nActiveX controls, or\n\n2092\n01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:03,350\nanything like that, it's all going\nto be prevented from running.\n\n2093\n01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:06,866\nBecause we know those sites are bad.\n\n2094\n01:38:06,866 --> 01:38:07,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2095\n01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:09,670\n>> Then we get over into\nthose trusted sites and\n\n2096\n01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:10,790\nthese are just the opposite, right.\n\n2097\n01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:14,170\nThese are sites that we know are good and\nthat\n\n2098\n01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:18,940\nwe want to allows those ActiveX controls\nto run and we don't want to be prompted.\n\n2099\n01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:23,550\nWe trust them,\nit's either a business partner or\n\n2100\n01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:25,410\njust a well known site that we trust.\n\n2101\n01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:26,680\nWe can add it here.\n\n2102\n01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,280\nAnd by default our slider is going to\nbe set to medium which is going to,\n\n2103\n01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,328\nas we can see there.\n\n2104\n01:38:31,328 --> 01:38:34,949\nUnsigned ActiveX controls\nwill not be downloaded but\n\n2105\n01:38:34,949 --> 01:38:38,190\nanything that is signed it should allow.\n\n2106\n01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:41,629\nAnything that it's unsure of,\nit should prompt the end user and\n\n2107\n01:38:41,629 --> 01:38:44,953\nleave the decision, unfortunately,\nin their hands, but.\n\n2108\n01:38:44,953 --> 01:38:47,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's gonna allow that stuff.\n\n2109\n01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:48,930\nAnd again, it's a trusted site, so\n\n2110\n01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:51,440\nwe're pretty sure it's not gonna\ndo anything bad to our computer.\n\n2111\n01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,600\n>> So like an extranet?\n\n2112\n01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:53,690\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n2113\n01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:58,700\n>> An extranet for our own company or\na vendor that we have to deal with.\n\n2114\n01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:03,960\nWe're a manufacturer, my job is to\norder product from our suppliers, and\n\n2115\n01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,130\nthey've got a web app that I do this with.\n\n2116\n01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:09,660\nSo I go to that web page, and\nthat web page relies on ActiveX\n\n2117\n01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:13,400\ncontrols to give it its functionality,\nits buttons and things like that.\n\n2118\n01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,070\nAnd I don't want those to be blocked.\n\n2119\n01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:18,460\nI need to be able to place these orders,\nso we know there are sites trusted.\n\n2120\n01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:22,700\nIt's not gonna affect my computer so\nwe're gonna put it in our trusted sites.\n\n2121\n01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:27,140\nAnd then local intranet is\nprobably self explanatory.\n\n2122\n01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:31,990\nThat's gonna be my own company's,\nor on my network, on my intranet.\n\n2123\n01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:36,600\nSo if we're running a web server within\nour company to host our company calendar\n\n2124\n01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,510\nor events that are coming up and\nthings like that.\n\n2125\n01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:45,170\nOr if we've got applications,\n\n2126\n01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:50,995\nweb apps that we're running internally,\nour local intranet sites.\n\n2127\n01:39:50,995 --> 01:39:54,370\nAnd those are detected\nautomatically by the computer.\n\n2128\n01:39:54,370 --> 01:39:57,354\nWhen it detects that it is\non the same domain as it,\n\n2129\n01:39:57,354 --> 01:39:59,995\nit applies these local internet settings.\n\n2130\n01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:04,703\nBut we can also add sites manually\nusing that sites button as well.\n\n2131\n01:40:04,703 --> 01:40:07,984\nAnd in the last one and the reason I like\nto go from the other side is the last one\n\n2132\n01:40:07,984 --> 01:40:09,130\nIs kind of the catch all.\n\n2133\n01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:12,460\nAnything that does not fall\ninto restricted, trusted, or\n\n2134\n01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:16,200\nlocal intranet is gonna be\ndumped into the Internet zone.\n\n2135\n01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:20,857\nAnd the the Internet zone has a not\nas quite as high as restricted, but\n\n2136\n01:40:20,857 --> 01:40:26,661\na more secure approach to allowing those\nActiveX controls and other active content.\n\n2137\n01:40:26,661 --> 01:40:29,550\n>> You know I think it's kind of funny.\n\n2138\n01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:32,300\nLike for\nthe security settings on this, right.\n\n2139\n01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:36,210\nSo its default is Medium High.\n\n2140\n01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:39,650\nSo we either go Medium High,\nHigh, or just Medium.\n\n2141\n01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:40,267\n>> No Low.\n\n2142\n01:40:40,267 --> 01:40:41,590\nThere's no Low.\n\n2143\n01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:43,400\nThere's no nothing else.\n\n2144\n01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:47,551\nAnd because my theory is because Low,\nright,\n\n2145\n01:40:47,551 --> 01:40:52,350\nis reserved right over here for\nyour local intranet.\n\n2146\n01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:57,159\nSo these different zones then\nare just preconfigured rules,\n\n2147\n01:40:57,159 --> 01:40:59,910\nthen, for what is allowed to run?\n\n2148\n01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:03,780\n>> Well what they're saying there\nis that in that Internet zone,\n\n2149\n01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:05,900\nthey're saying that it's not\nrecommended that you do Low.\n\n2150\n01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:08,220\nThey're not even giving you that slide or\noption.\n\n2151\n01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:13,080\nIf you go back over to Internet, your only\noptions again were gonna be Medium High,\n\n2152\n01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,920\nHigh and Medium.\n\n2153\n01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:21,080\nBut if we wanted to apply Low settings to\nthat we would just go to our custom level.\n\n2154\n01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:24,170\nAnd if we click that\nbutton over there then we\n\n2155\n01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:27,080\ncan configure each setting individually.\n\n2156\n01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,759\nAnd then if you look at the little\ndrop down list I believe\n\n2157\n01:41:29,759 --> 01:41:31,703\nthe Reset too might give you the others?\n\n2158\n01:41:31,703 --> 01:41:33,385\nNo, they're saying,\n\n2159\n01:41:33,385 --> 01:41:39,520\nyou really don't wanna go any lower\nthan Medium with your Internet zone.\n\n2160\n01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,160\nIf you choose to do so,\nyou can go into these custom settings, and\n\n2161\n01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,499\nyou can pick through each one of those.\n\n2162\n01:41:44,499 --> 01:41:46,570\n>> [LAUGH].\nAnd decide what you wanna do.\n\n2163\n01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:50,905\n>> So, it's not that you can't have your\nInternet zone set to the same security\n\n2164\n01:41:50,905 --> 01:41:52,578\nsettings as Local Intranet.\n\n2165\n01:41:52,578 --> 01:41:55,370\nBut you have to do it manually,\nyou don't have a slider option for that.\n\n2166\n01:41:55,370 --> 01:42:02,270\n>> Nice, right on.\n\n2167\n01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:05,996\nSo the next sub-objective,\ncalled out, right, managing add-ons.\n\n2168\n01:42:05,996 --> 01:42:08,425\n>> Managing add ons.\n\n2169\n01:42:08,425 --> 01:42:11,843\n>> Yeah, goodness,\n\n2170\n01:42:11,843 --> 01:42:17,110\nit's probably the most thing that I find\nI have to do with Internet Explorer.\n\n2171\n01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:20,760\nIt's not for my computer cuz mine,\nit's really clean.\n\n2172\n01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:25,374\n[LAUGH]\n>> ther people's computers,\n\n2173\n01:42:25,374 --> 01:42:32,328\nlike that dadgum Yahoo toolbar,\nright, I mean who?\n\n2174\n01:42:32,328 --> 01:42:32,828\nI don't know.\n\n2175\n01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:35,995\nMaybe some people, sorry Yahoo.\n\n2176\n01:42:35,995 --> 01:42:37,284\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That toolbar finds\n\n2177\n01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:37,828\nits way, like, everywhere.\n\n2178\n01:42:37,828 --> 01:42:38,860\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n2179\n01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:44,371\nYou know, all those little free programs\nthat you get, if you don't pay attention.\n\n2180\n01:42:44,371 --> 01:42:47,270\nI mean you go through and clickety\nclick click and install the program.\n\n2181\n01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:50,690\nYou miss the little check mark\nthat says add the Ask toolbar and\n\n2182\n01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:55,070\nmake Ask your default search engine,\nand things like that.\n\n2183\n01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:57,987\nI will tell you, and Lynn forgive me,\n\n2184\n01:42:57,987 --> 01:43:03,744\nI have gone to my stepmother's computer\nbefore and opened up her browser.\n\n2185\n01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:05,650\nAnd she has about this much room for\n\n2186\n01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:10,940\nher browser because she has about six\ninches worth of tool bars across the top.\n\n2187\n01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,360\nJust because all the different\nthings she's installed has\n\n2188\n01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:17,710\nadded additional toolbars to your browser.\n\n2189\n01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:19,334\nSo we need to be able to turn those off.\n\n2190\n01:43:19,334 --> 01:43:20,947\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We need to be able to manage all of\n\n2191\n01:43:20,947 --> 01:43:22,330\nthose add-ons.\n\n2192\n01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:24,280\nSo show us where we go and\nwhat we do here.\n\n2193\n01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:30,790\n>> All right, so right now,\nI am installing a toolbar, right?\n\n2194\n01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:33,569\n>> It says that you've\nblocked this program.\n\n2195\n01:43:33,569 --> 01:43:35,620\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, man.\n\n2196\n01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:36,530\n>> AppLocker.\n\n2197\n01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:37,220\n>>

right, let me try and\ndownload it again.\n\n2204\n01:43:55,210 --> 01:43:58,390\nAll right, so there's a toolbar, right?\n\n2205\n01:43:58,390 --> 01:44:01,250\nTo stay with our user's theme, right.\n\n2206\n01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:06,010\nBecause now we've allowed access to Steam.\n\n2207\n01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:07,660\nRight?\nSo they want to be able to launch that\n\n2208\n01:44:07,660 --> 01:44:09,890\ngame, right,\nthat Steam game whenever they want.\n\n2209\n01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:10,510\nRight?\n\n2210\n01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:12,780\nSo there's a Steam toolbar.\n\n2211\n01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:13,550\n>> Oh, handy.\n\n2212\n01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:14,210\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nSo\n\n2213\n01:44:14,210 --> 01:44:19,420\nnow, just browsing the Internet, they have\na free minute, they can fire that game up.\n\n2214\n01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:21,650\nAnd what better way than\nto do it from a toolbar.\n\n2215\n01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:22,320\n>> Nice.\n\n2216\n01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:28,470\n>> So we'll install this guy right quick.\n\n2217\n01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:29,150\nThere it goes.\n\n2218\n01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:32,990\nWe're gonna do,

--> 01:51:44,541\nSorry.\n\n2388\n01:51:44,541 --> 01:51:48,257\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And our content page.\n\n2389\n01:51:48,257 --> 01:51:48,778\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n2390\n01:51:48,778 --> 01:51:52,130\n>> And\nshow content advisor on Internet options.\n\n2391\n01:51:52,130 --> 01:51:56,560\n>> All right,\nlet's enable this guy, click Apply.\n\n2392\n01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,510\n>> You gotta wonder why\nthey took that away.\n\n2393\n01:51:58,510 --> 01:52:01,580\nWhy they make you turn it on first?\n\n2394\n01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:02,388\n>> Yeah,\nI thought that was kinda strange too.\n\n2395\n01:52:02,388 --> 01:52:03,530\nSo yeah, you make a good point.\n\n2396\n01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:06,020\n>> Very good to know.\n\n2397\n01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:10,390\n>> Alright, you know what,\nclose that guy down.\n\n2398\n01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,860\nNow, do you think we will\nhave to do a GP update?\n\n2399\n01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,993\n>> It depends.\n\n2400\n01:52:16,286 --> 01:52:18,660\nSometimes you get lucky with the timing.\n\n2401\n01:52:20,036 --> 01:52:21,300\nOh, there it is.\n\n2402\n01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,900\n>> Content advisor, right?\n\n2403\n01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:28,680\nWe enable this guy, turn this guy on,\nand we can set approved\n\n2404\n01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:33,515\nsites on where we can go,\nthings of that nature.\n\n2405\n01:52:33,515 --> 01:52:37,070\n>> [COUGH]\n>> We have more fun stuff to further\n\n2406\n01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:40,580\ncontrol access where\nInternet Explorer can go to.\n\n2407\n01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:43,690\n>> Yeah, and you're really going\nto see this feature used, one,\n\n2408\n01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:45,610\nthis is available in your\nhome versions as well.\n\n2409\n01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:50,450\nSo on your home front, where you've got\nchildren, minors, browsing, and you wanna\n\n2410\n01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:54,704\nhave a little control over the content\nthat's being displayed on those webpages.\n\n2411\n01:52:54,704 --> 01:53:02,350\nSchool environments, I see that\nused a lot at the VA for example,\n\n2412\n01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:07,865\nthey'll use this, restrict certain words\nand things like that from being displayed.\n\n2413\n01:53:07,865 --> 01:53:09,770\n>> Hm, right, down to words?\n\n2414\n01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:11,190\n>> Yeah.\n\n2415\n01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:14,960\n>> Huh.\n>> Well like, at a school, well if you\n\n2416\n01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,374\npull up those settings again, I don't\nknow we want to go into detail on this,\n\n2417\n01:53:17,374 --> 01:53:20,360\nand its not gonna be covered\nsuper heavy on the exam.\n\n2418\n01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:24,840\nMainly knowing that its there and what\nyour allowed to do, but you can use those\n\n2419\n01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:31,130\nsliders to kind of control how much of\na particular category each one is allowed.\n\n2420\n01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:35,310\n>> Hm, nice.\n>> So yeah, kind of fun to play with.\n\n2421\n01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:39,760\nAnd like I said, this is something\nI see primarily where I've got\n\n2422\n01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:43,020\npublic access computers,\nlibraries, things like that.\n\n2423\n01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,160\nWhere who know's what the last person was,\nand I don't mean to offend [LAUGH] but,\n\n2424\n01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:49,870\nthe person that's sitting down there next,\nand things like that.\n\n2425\n01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:52,510\nHigh school computer labs,\n\n2426\n01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:55,815\nwhere you need to really have\ncontrol over what they're browsing.\n\n2427\n01:53:55,815 --> 01:53:56,590\n>> Hm.\n\n2428\n01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:59,150\n>> We see those used, and\nthen in the home front.\n\n2429\n01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:00,402\n>> Mm-hm, nice, nice.\n\n2430\n01:54:00,402 --> 01:54:01,926\n>> Yep.\n>> That's awesome.\n\n2431\n01:54:01,926 --> 01:54:07,950\nWell, Mike, yeah,\nwe're right at the end of our little show.\n\n2432\n01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:08,910\n>> Aw, it's sad.\n\n2433\n01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:11,491\n>> Yeah, there's a-\n>> We've got more, right?\n\n2434\n01:54:11,491 --> 01:54:12,544\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2435\n01:54:12,544 --> 01:54:13,921\n>> We'll be back again.\n\n2436\n01:54:13,921 --> 01:54:14,650\n>> Yep, yep, yep.\n\n2437\n01:54:14,650 --> 01:54:18,231\nNow, yeah, Internet Explorers-\n>> Hopefully, if you'll have me back.\n\n2438\n01:54:18,231 --> 01:54:21,319\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There's a wealth of things to\n\n2439\n01:54:21,319 --> 01:54:26,980\nconfigure and choose on that stuff\nas a little last going away advice.\n\n2440\n01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:32,800\nPreparing for the exam, I switched\neverything to Microsoft products.\n\n2441\n01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,500\n>> You really need to, don't you?\n\n2442\n01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:38,260\nI mean that's the thing is, what you guys\nhave to think about out there and gals,\n\n2443\n01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:43,585\nis I understand that Internet Explorer\nis not your favorite browser, all right?\n\n2444\n01:54:43,585 --> 01:54:44,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I feel you,\n\n2445\n01:54:44,410 --> 01:54:46,505\nbut they're not going\nto test you on Chrome.\n\n2446\n01:54:46,505 --> 01:54:49,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're not gonna test you on Firefox.\n\n2447\n01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:51,280\nSo no matter how well\nyou know those browsers,\n\n2448\n01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:55,040\nhow well you like those browsers,\nyou really have to use Internet Explorer.\n\n2449\n01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,710\nYou need to be familiar with\nthose options on there.\n\n2450\n01:54:57,710 --> 01:55:00,120\nAnd the only way to do that is to\nget in there and play with it.\n\n2451\n01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:02,580\nSo force yourself, for a couple of weeks,\n\n2452\n01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:06,350\nto use Internet Explorer\nas your default browser.\n\n2453\n01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:09,240\nPlay with all the options in there,\ngo through the tabs that we didn't talk\n\n2454\n01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:14,700\nabout, click on everything, explore,\nand get familiar with those options.\n\n2455\n01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,775\n>> Yep, and once you go IE,\nyou never go back.\n\n2456\n01:55:17,775 --> 01:55:19,460\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n2457\n01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:20,150\n>> Right on.\n\n2458\n01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:23,250\nAlright, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n2459\n01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:24,660\nWe covered a lot of stuff.\n\n2460\n01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:25,655\n>> We did, a lot of fun today.\n\n2461\n01:55:25,655 --> 01:55:28,050\n>> Yep, a lot of fun stuff and\nconfiguring things.\n\n2462\n01:55:28,050 --> 01:55:30,940\nSo, we'll do it again next time?\n\n2463\n01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:31,940\n>> Sounds good.\n\n2464\n01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:33,701\n>> Until then.\n>> See ya.\n\n2465\n01:55:33,701 --> 01:55:43,701\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:36,149\nGood afternoon, good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,211\nwelcome to another great\nfantastic ITProTV episode today.\n\n6\n00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:44,022\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Mike Roderick.\n\n7\n00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:46,050\n>> How's everybody doing?\n\n8\n00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,660\n>> Mike?\n\n9\n00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,500\n>> Yeah, they can't respond.\n\n10\n00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,300\nI know you're doing good out there.\n\n11\n00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,350\n>> Yeah, that's nice, that's nice.\n\n12\n00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,280\nThanks for being on the show.\n\n13\n00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,430\n>> Hey, thanks for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,320\nI appreciate it.\n\n15\n00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,195\nFor something that's real awesome, today\nwe're gonna be talking about Hyper-V.\n\n16\n00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:01,935\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n17\n00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:07,150\n>> Hyper-V is a Windows\nvirtualization thing where we can\n\n18\n00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,710\nrun a computer inside a computer.\n\n19\n00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n20\n00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,540\n>> Isolated and do stuff, right?\n\n21\n00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,310\n>> Absolutely.\n\n22\n00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,390\nIt's gonna be a cool show.\n\n23\n00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,890\nLove me some virtualization.\n\n24\n00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,560\n>> Yeah.\n\n25\n00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,600\nSo virtualization,\nit's running it on Windows 8, right?\n\n26\n00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400\nSo it's new to Windows 8.\n\n27\n00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,810\nBefore it was a server only thing.\n\n28\n00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,610\n>> Yeah.\nSo really today,\n\n29\n00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,075\nwe should probably clarify, we're gonna\nbe looking at client side virtualization.\n\n30\n00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:32,800\nMm-hm.\n>> Right.\n\n31\n00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,930\nBecause we do have virtualization\nthat's been available for\n\n32\n00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,675\nsome time in the server.\n\n33\n00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:39,120\nHyper-V itself has been available since,\nwhat, 2008?\n\n34\n00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,306\n>> Correct.\n>> Maybe before that.\n\n35\n00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:42,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n36\n00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,470\n>> And before that we had other\ntechnologies we could use, right.\n\n37\n00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,045\nWe had virtual server, we had virtual\nPC that we would use on the client but\n\n38\n00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:52,620\nHyper-V was a server only thing.\n\n39\n00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,770\nYou installed it on server 2008,\n2008 R2 as a role and now in 2012,\n\n40\n00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,420\nbut with Windows 8, we've actually,\nhave something called the client Hyper V,\n\n41\n00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,110\nwhich allows me to do the same thing we're\ndoing on our servers on our clients.\n\n42\n00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,175\n>> Yeah.\n>> In our client operating system.\n\n43\n00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:10,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n44\n00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,330\nVirtualization stuff,\n\n45\n00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,870\nat first, it was a bit daunting of\na subject to wrap my head around.\n\n46\n00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,240\nYou can have virtual machines,\nvirtual hard drives, virtual networks.\n\n47\n00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,680\n>> Yeah.\n>> And have like,\n\n48\n00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,450\na whole little mini infrastructure\nrunning on one machine.\n\n49\n00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,570\n>> Absolutely.\n\n50\n00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,750\n>> So, yeah,\nit's kind of a strange subject to\n\n51\n00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,030\nwrap my head around it at first.\n\n52\n00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,450\n>> It is twisty, especially for\nstudents that are newer to the industry.\n\n53\n00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,560\nYou're just trying to get\nwrapped around server itself and\n\n54\n00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,890\nyour client operating systems and\nnow you're talking about installing server\n\n55\n00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,725\non a server inside a virtual machine\nwith a virtual hard drive and\n\n56\n00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:56,985\nmounting up virtual ISOs into\nvirtual VDDs and things like that.\n\n57\n00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,714\nSo, it can be a little bit confusing\nat first but that's what you and\n\n58\n00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:05,680\nI are here to do, is clear all that up and\nteach you guys about Hyper V and\n\n59\n00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,780\nwhy we'd want to use it on our\nclients in the first place.\n\n60\n00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,710\nObviously, we're not going to\nbe running a virtual network\n\n61\n00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,955\nin an enterprise environment\nfrom a Windows 8 machine, right?\n\n62\n00:03:15,955 --> 00:03:17,011\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what are we doing with\n\n63\n00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:17,630\nit on our client?\n\n64\n00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,020\n>> Hopefully not.\n\n65\n00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,860\nAnd it's really cool because now,\n\n66\n00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,260\nbecause we're using the same technology in\nthe client operating system, I can test,\n\n67\n00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,830\nI can develop, I can create virtual\nmachines that are gonna be used in my\n\n68\n00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,319\nproduction environment,\ngonna be used up on my servers.\n\n69\n00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,910\nBut I can develop them in my cubicle,\nin my office, on my client machine,\n\n70\n00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,350\noutside of the production environment,\nthen move them over when I need to.\n\n71\n00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,370\n>> So, Mike, lemme ask you this.\n\n72\n00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:44,990\n>> Yes.\n\n73\n00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:51,080\n>> Do you use any virtualization\noutside of your day to day job?\n\n74\n00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,090\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n75\n00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,590\n>> What do you use it for, Mike?\n\n76\n00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,580\n>> I have a server I run at the house\nthat I use as a test platform.\n\n77\n00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,990\nSo it's a Dell 2950 and\nI run Hyper-V on that,\n\n78\n00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,050\nand then I create my virtual machines when\nnew products come out from Microsoft that\n\n79\n00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,112\nI need to familiarize myself with, when I\njust want to test and play with something,\n\n80\n00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:20,361\nafter midnight, I put the black hat on and\ngo to the dark side.\n\n81\n00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't want to install some of that\n\n82\n00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,990\nstuff on my machine.\n\n83\n00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,070\nSo I can create a virtual\nnetwork environment,\n\n84\n00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,050\na virtual machine that is isolated\nfrom the rest of my network and\n\n85\n00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,320\nI can test some of that stuff out without\nfear of infecting my entire network.\n\n86\n00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,420\n>> That's a great thing.\n\n87\n00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,580\nI use CyberV at my house.\n\n88\n00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,038\nI use it for\ntesting all sorts of things because it's\n\n89\n00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:51,900\nsometimes it's a real pain to tear down\nyour operating system to reinstall stuff,\n\n90\n00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,650\ninstall all your things when you\njust want to test something out or\n\n91\n00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,250\ntry things, get computers talking\nto each other and share things.\n\n92\n00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,800\n>> It's real convenient just to fire\nup a virtual machine, break it, and\n\n93\n00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,390\nthen just delete it, and you're not\nhaving to wipe out your databases too.\n\n94\n00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,200\n>> And for you guys that are studying for\nthese exams, you get your books,\n\n95\n00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,570\nwatch our shows, and you're studying for\nthese exams,but how do you play with that,\n\n96\n00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,410\nhow do you get in there and\nactually play with Server 2012,\n\n97\n00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,100\nand play with Windows 8 if you're not\nrunning that on your machine currently?\n\n98\n00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,140\nWell, with Client Hyper-V, I can do that.\n\n99\n00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,970\nI can create some servers.\n\n100\n00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,360\nI can install Active Directory, I can play\nwith DNS, I can set up a second domain.\n\n101\n00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,251\nWe can emulate whatever we want.\n\n102\n00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,855\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We can have two domain controllers that\n\n103\n00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,039\nare in two different locations, right?\n\n104\n00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Different sites\n\n105\n00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,160\neven though they're both right\nhere on my same machine and\n\n106\n00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,370\nplay with intersite replication and\nthings like that.\n\n107\n00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,640\nSo it's exciting stuff.\n\n108\n00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,218\nWhat better to do on a Friday night\nthan to test out intersite replication?\n\n109\n00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,752\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Geeks.\n\n110\n00:05:54,752 --> 00:05:56,390\n>> Yeah, that's awesome.\n\n111\n00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,730\nNow specifically, what we are gonna talk\nabout today, we are going to create and\n\n112\n00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,042\nconfigure a virtual machine.\n\n113\n00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,330\n>> Sweet.\n>> We're going to manage the snapshots,\n\n114\n00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,600\nwere getting to the head of the snapshots,\ncreate and configure virtual switches,\n\n115\n00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:17,415\nso that machines can talk to each other\nand create and configure virtual disks.\n\n116\n00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,000\nBefore we actually start\na virtual machine,\n\n117\n00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,720\nwe've got to make sure our\nhardware can run Hyper-V.\n\n118\n00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,089\nHyper-V does have some\nhardware requirements,\n\n119\n00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:37,590\nyou have to be running a 64-bit edition\nof Windows 8 Pro or Windows 8 Enterprise.\n\n120\n00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,970\n>> Correct, for the client Hyper-V, so\n32-bit is not going to be supported.\n\n121\n00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,090\n>> Yep, yep and you need to have\nat least 4 gigabytes of RAM.\n\n122\n00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,422\n>> Better take that up, right.\n\n123\n00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:51,260\nYeah, 4 gigs is what you need to know for\n\n124\n00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,190\nthe exam, that is the minimum to\ninstall it but as we'll soon see,\n\n125\n00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,790\nwe've gotta have memory assigned\nto each virtual machine we create.\n\n126\n00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,216\nSo if we with 4 gigs of RAM,\n\n127\n00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:04,520\nmy host operating system's\nalready taking 1.7 to 2 gigs.\n\n128\n00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,680\nThat doesn't leave a lot for\nvirtual machine.\n\n129\n00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,055\nSo we'll be using more than that but\nminimum, yes, 4 gigs.\n\n130\n00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:11,555\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n131\n00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,280\n>> Sorry.\n\n132\n00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,830\n>> No.\n\n133\n00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,630\n>> Sometimes I laugh at\nthe minimum requirements but\n\n134\n00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,290\nyou have to remember that word minimum\nin there, it's not saying this is ideal,\n\n135\n00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,220\nit's not saying this\nis what you should do.\n\n136\n00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,596\nIt's saying that if you had to, you\ncould get away with just 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n137\n00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:31,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n138\n00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,160\n>> And for the exam,\nwe need to know 4 gigs of RAM.\n\n139\n00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,110\n>> We need a CPU that supports\nsecond level address translation,\n\n140\n00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,140\nwhich is this hardware assist.\n\n141\n00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,340\n>> What'd you call me?\n\n142\n00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,363\nSlash?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:46,869\n>> Oops.\n\n144\n00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:47,562\nSorry, Mike.\n\n145\n00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:52,681\nIt's this hardware assisted virtualization\n\n146\n00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,484\nthat makes better use of Memory and\n\n147\n00:07:56,484 --> 00:08:00,253\nresources.\n>> Really what we need to know is as long\n\n148\n00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:05,358\nas your CPU supports second level address\ntranslation or SLAT, you're gonna\n\n149\n00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:08,194\nbe able to install the client Hyper V.\nAnd\n\n150\n00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:12,360\nreally what it's doing is making\neverything more efficient.\n\n151\n00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,680\nIt makes better use of the memory and\n\n152\n00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,730\nthe processor allocation\nto the virtual machine.\n\n153\n00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,980\nIt speeds up the,\nnot really speeds up, but\n\n154\n00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,716\nthey'll say CPU utilization by\nvirtual machine drops from 10% to 8%.\n\n155\n00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,803\nSorry, 10% to 2% overhead.\n\n156\n00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,963\nFor the hyper v roll.\n\n157\n00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,636\nSo, it does make a big difference.\n\n158\n00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:34,877\n>> Yep.\n\n159\n00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:38,660\nNow, a quick way to test your machine.\n\n160\n00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,560\nRight?\nIs there is a tool from Sysinternals.\n\n161\n00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,940\nMm.\n>> Right, and it's called core info.\n\n162\n00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,070\nAnd it will tell you if\nyour hardware supports it.\n\n163\n00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,690\n>> Sweet.\n\n164\n00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,540\n>> Mm-hm.\nNow I've already downloaded.\n\n165\n00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,590\n>> Fantastic because I\nhave not seen this one.\n\n166\n00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,290\n>> Oh yeah?\n>> Sysinternals\n\n167\n00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,590\nmakes some really good tools.\n\n168\n00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,610\nDefinitely a site worth checking out.\n\n169\n00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,210\n>> Yep, yep.\nSo, yeah let's run it.\n\n170\n00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,860\nAnd so what we'll check\nthe requirements on this computer, now.\n\n171\n00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,540\nSo there's a core info, right,\nsittin' there on the desktop.\n\n172\n00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,295\nNow, to run the guy,\nwe need an administrative command prompt.\n\n173\n00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:19,730\nAnd we'll browse to the folder where it's\nat, which is in C:/users/Nathan/desktop.\n\n174\n00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,460\nThere is core info and\nit's coreinfo.EXE-V.\n\n175\n00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,740\nNow an asterisk means yes and\na dash means no.\n\n176\n00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,060\nSo right now I do not have\na hypervisor present, so that's good.\n\n177\n00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,140\n>> Haven't installed it yet.\n\n178\n00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,220\n>> I haven't installed it yet.\n\n179\n00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,420\nWe'll do that next.\n\n180\n00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,878\nAnd I do support the hardware system\nvirtualization and I do support slat.\n\n181\n00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:44,460\n>> Nice.\n\n182\n00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,170\nYou're goo to go.\n\n183\n00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,101\n>> Yep, we're good to go.\n\n184\n00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:46,910\n>> Fantastic.\n\n185\n00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,810\n>> And I have more that 4 gigs of RAM,\nor at least 4 gigs and, good stuff.\n\n186\n00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,765\n>> Good deal.\n>> All right.\n\n187\n00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:58,405\n>> We've made sure our machine meets\nall the minimum requirements to install\n\n188\n00:09:58,405 --> 00:09:59,835\nthe client Hyper-V.\n\n189\n00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,805\nSo the next thing to do\nI guess would be to-\n\n190\n00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:04,295\n>> Install it?\n\n191\n00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:06,505\n>> Let's do it.\n\n192\n00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,771\nLet's do it.\n\n193\n00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:12,010\nDo you already have, I know some machines\nyou do have to go in and enable that\n\n194\n00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,820\nsecond level address translation, like\nit's not enabled by default or enabled it.\n\n195\n00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,680\nHave you done that on your BIOS?\n\n196\n00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,470\n>> Let's check it.\n\n197\n00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,250\nIs there way you do it from in the BIOS?\n\n198\n00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,524\n>> Yes, where do you do it?\n\n199\n00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,836\n[LAUGH].\n\n200\n00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:31,950\n>> [LAUGH] Sorry I went somewhere else,\nall right yeah.\n\n201\n00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,040\nLet's get into the bios and\nso we'll drop off here for\n\n202\n00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,380\njust a minute, and\nlet's get to BIOSand we'll check it out.\n\n203\n00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,280\n>> See what we got.\n\n204\n00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:48,280\nSo Nate will get that switched over and\nwe will have to disconnect, cuz\n\n205\n00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,000\nhe's gonna be going to his BIOS so we're\ngonna lose connection there for a second.\n\n206\n00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,320\n>> Now you did mention that,\n\n207\n00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,415\n4 gigs of ram would be the absolute\nminimum that you would want.\n\n208\n00:10:58,415 --> 00:10:59,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n209\n00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,660\n>> Right, and that's true,\nvirtual machines, they will need more RAM.\n\n210\n00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,770\nWhat about Hard drives?\n\n211\n00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:11,480\nJust one hard drive to-\n>> Well, you can get away with one and\n\n212\n00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,270\na lot of your, like on my laptop here,\n\n213\n00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,980\nI've got a single solid\nstate drive in there.\n\n214\n00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,200\nI might create a second partition just for\nlogical reasons.\n\n215\n00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,000\nBut, Performance wise,\nit makes no difference.\n\n216\n00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,300\nIdeally though, we would have\nseparate hard drives to store\n\n217\n00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,240\nthe virtual machines on because\nof the disk contention.\n\n218\n00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,610\nYou've got your host operating system\nthat wants to talk to the hard drive and\n\n219\n00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,220\nyour host operating system.\n\n220\n00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,780\nThen you've got virtual machines that\nare trying to talk to their hard drives.\n\n221\n00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:46,135\nSo if we have separate disk IO there we're\ngonna see a big performance improvement.\n\n222\n00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n223\n00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,290\nRight on.\nAll right.\n\n224\n00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,090\nI've got the, yep, BIOS turned on.\n\n225\n00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,690\n>> Woo hoo.\n>> All right.\n\n226\n00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,510\nNow as far as, you know the.\n\n227\n00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,190\n>> Vanna White.\n>> [LAUGH] Thanks Mike.\n\n228\n00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,960\n>> You're welcome.\n\n229\n00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,730\n>> As far as the settings in the BIOS.\n\n230\n00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,570\nSo the terminology should all be more or\n\n231\n00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,960\nless consistent across\ndifferent BIOS version.\n\n232\n00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,570\nBut where it's at in the BIOS, different\nvendors put it in different places.\n\n233\n00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,825\nSo this one's a Dell XPS, and on mine,\nit is in the Advanced section,\n\n234\n00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:22,090\nand it's simply just\nVirtualization Enabled.\n\n235\n00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,660\n>> Nice.\n\n236\n00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,920\nAnd it turned on.\n\n237\n00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,120\n>> And it is turned on.\n\n238\n00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,980\nSo, we're good.\n\n239\n00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,760\nSo, we meet the hardware requirements.\n\n240\n00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,740\nWe have it enabled in the BIOS,\nand so now we can move forward and\n\n241\n00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,140\ninstall the feature.\n\n242\n00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,920\n>> Yes sir.\n\n243\n00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,760\nLet's do it to it.\n\n244\n00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,470\n>> All right, so\nwe'll give it a minute or two,\n\n245\n00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,850\nwe'll get this guy turned on and fired up.\n\n246\n00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,000\nAnd you know, Mike, at my house I run\nHyperV on virtual machines at the house.\n\n247\n00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,820\n>> Oh yeah?\n>> Yeah, on the hard drives,\n\n248\n00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,880\nwhen they're all running\noff of one hard drive,\n\n249\n00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,970\nthe virtual machines, they're slow-\n>> Chugging.\n\n250\n00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,390\n>> Yeah, chugging along.\n\n251\n00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,250\nAnd I end up using a striped.\n\n252\n00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,750\nI have three hard drives striped together.\n\n253\n00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,890\nHave all the virtual machines dumped on\nthat and it makes a world of a difference.\n\n254\n00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,550\n>> Absolutely, anything you\ncan do to improve your Disk IO\n\n255\n00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,010\nis gonna help with your\nvirtual machine performance.\n\n256\n00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:23,060\nCause if you think about it you're running\ntwo, three, four other operating systems.\n\n257\n00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,960\nOn that hard drive, so you're maps out,\n\n258\n00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,130\nquadrupling the amount of\ndisk IO you're sending to it.\n\n259\n00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,147\nSo if you can dump it\non top of a raid array,\n\n260\n00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,300\nthat's gonna give you much better disk IO.\n\n261\n00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,030\nIf you could put the drives on\na separate again, physical disk.\n\n262\n00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,350\nNot separate volumes on\nthe same physical disk because\n\n263\n00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,170\nthat's not really going to\nimprove your disk IO right.\n\n264\n00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,710\nSo we're talking about separate\nphysical hard drives in the machine.\n\n265\n00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,690\n>> All right we are getting\nthis guy fired up.\n\n266\n00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,733\n>> Good deal let's bring it up and\nsee what we've got.\n\n267\n00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:04,880\nSteam, hey wait last episode\nwe blocked that didn't we.\n\n268\n00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,758\n>> Oops.\n\n269\n00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:11,240\nAll right, so Hyper-V feature isn't\ninstalled in Windows by default.\n\n270\n00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,525\n>> Correct.\n>> Now it is sitting there.\n\n271\n00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:14,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We've just got to turn the guy on.\n\n272\n00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,297\nNow to do that, we can get into our\nstart screen and just type in features.\n\n273\n00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:19,812\nRight?\n\n274\n00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:20,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n275\n00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,720\n>> And we'll search the settings.\n\n276\n00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,950\nAnd now it's not in programs and features\nbut turn windows features on or off.\n\n277\n00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:32,680\nThen in this list,then right\nthere up at the top Hyper-V.\n\n278\n00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,534\nThere are different aspects of\nthe Hyper-V suite we can install but\n\n279\n00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:38,909\nwe're just going to install all of them.\n\n280\n00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,709\n>> It's going to include\nthe Hyper-V platform,\n\n281\n00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,520\nit's gonna be the pieces you need to\nrun the client side virtualization.\n\n282\n00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,920\nThe other option I believe was\nthe management tools, and so\n\n283\n00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,790\nyou might be responsible for\n\n284\n00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,930\nmanaging all the Hyper-V servers that\nare in your server closet at your work.\n\n285\n00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,730\nYou can install just the Hyper-V\nmanagement tools on your Windows 8 client,\n\n286\n00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,690\nand then remotely manage\nyour Hyper-V servers.\n\n287\n00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,660\n>> All right, so\nwe've got the first little bit done,\n\n288\n00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,900\nit's going to restart now.\n\n289\n00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,400\nSo we'll drop out for a little bit.\n\n290\n00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,946\n>> And it is going to require at\nleast one if not two reboots to\n\n291\n00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:20,417\ninstall the Hyper-V roll or featur\n>> Yeah, so\n\n292\n00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:24,144\nthere's this Hyper Visor type\nthing that sits above the.\n\n293\n00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:27,255\nDon's draws this little picture and\n\n294\n00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:31,680\neverything of all this\nreally neat stuff of, yeah.\n\n295\n00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,430\nSo, it's gonna take\na couple of reboots and\n\n296\n00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,760\nget the system set up to start running.\n\n297\n00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,670\n>> You gonna read those books now?\n\n298\n00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,070\nWe should describe it as a a thin\nlayer of software that resides between\n\n299\n00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,428\nthe kernel and the user.\n\n300\n00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:43,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n301\n00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,482\nYou're like, wait, what?\n\n302\n00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:46,480\n[LAUGH] So, yeah.\n\n303\n00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,583\nThat's exactly what it is, right?\n\n304\n00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,680\nIt's sitting in between our guest\noperating systems and the physical\n\n305\n00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,417\nhardware and it's exposing that physical\nhardware to those virtual machines.\n\n306\n00:15:56,417 --> 00:16:00,208\nIt's like they run side by side, right.\n\n307\n00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:06,080\nLike you've got your host operating\nsystem and the guests side by side.\n\n308\n00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,890\n>> It's pretty fascinating when you\nstart looking at it you're thinking,\n\n309\n00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,790\nI've got a single network adapter in\nthis machine, yet, I've got four virtual\n\n310\n00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,260\nmachines that all have a network adapter\nthat have different IP addresses,\n\n311\n00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,610\ncan be connected to different networks\nIt's pretty impressive stuff.\n\n312\n00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,610\n>> it is.\nIt is.\n\n313\n00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,630\n>> It's a little deep.\n\n314\n00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,190\n>> Yeah it does.\n\n315\n00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,030\nIt does definitely and so yeah,\n\n316\n00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:32,160\nonce this computer finishes setting\nthings up and we boot up into it,\n\n317\n00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,230\nthe first thing we're going to do\nis just create a virtual machine.\n\n318\n00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,900\n>> Cool.\n>> So starting that route then we'll take\n\n319\n00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,100\na look at the features and\n\n320\n00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,040\nthings that it's going take to set this\nguy up and we're on the last restart.\n\n321\n00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,540\n>> Yeah you know, you can't see this out\nthere, but it's on reboot number two.\n\n322\n00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,630\n>> Yep.\n>> So, it should be the last one.\n\n323\n00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,220\n>> Yeah, it's on SSD so\nit boots pretty fast.\n\n324\n00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,000\n>> When did we did start this?\n\n325\n00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,670\nThree minutes ago?\n\n326\n00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,851\n>> Yeah.\n>> And he's done.Picture passwords.\n\n327\n00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:03,490\nNice.\n\n328\n00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,210\n>> It's nice.\n\n329\n00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,165\n>> It's all yours now.\n\n330\n00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:12,330\n[LAUGH]\nYes, I do actually, on this touchscreen.\n\n331\n00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,450\nIt's very convenient.\n\n332\n00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,100\n>> It is.\n\n333\n00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,670\n>> As long as you remember to wipe\nyour fingerprints off your screen now\n\n334\n00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,415\nand again.\n\n335\n00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:20,940\n[LAUGH] But we'll save that for security.\n\n336\n00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,910\n>> And you know,\nI do picture password at the house.\n\n337\n00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,426\n>> Do you?\n\n338\n00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:29,180\n>> Yeah, for my boot so you have\nlike a nice, strong password on it.\n\n339\n00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,110\nBut then he just clicks\nthe mouse in different places,\n\n340\n00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,730\nso I don't have to weaken my security.\n\n341\n00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,230\n>> Got you.\n\n342\n00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,480\n>> All right,\nwe got this thing fired back up.\n\n343\n00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,300\nNow it's time to create a virtual machine.\n\n344\n00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,180\nIf we go into our Start screen, right?\n\n345\n00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,770\nSo up there at the top we've got the.\n\n346\n00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,550\nThe text is a little on the small side.\n\n347\n00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,230\nWe have the HyperV Manager, right?\n\n348\n00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,160\nAnd that is where we are going to start.\n\n349\n00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,420\nAnd there's that other utility.\n\n350\n00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,700\nI don't see it in here.\n\n351\n00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,070\nThe Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n352\n00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,880\nThe connection manager.\n\n353\n00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,900\n>> Can you scroll over?\n\n354\n00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,060\nOr is it behind your..?\n\n355\n00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,850\n>> Yeah, it's behind the thing.\n\n356\n00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,780\nAll right, well, Hyper-V manager.\n\n357\n00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,620\nNow, we installed the rule.\n\n358\n00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,528\nNow, I use this.\n\n359\n00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,890\nI use Hyper-V outside of everything,\nso there is some existing machines and\n\n360\n00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,490\nconfiguration In there.\n\n361\n00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,340\n>> Oh, does it come with those already.\n\n362\n00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,050\n>> No, those are my existing ones.\n\n363\n00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,980\nI didn't want to wipe them all out,\nyou know, for the show.\n\n364\n00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,040\n>> For those of you at home, yeah,\n\n365\n00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,817\nwhen you install the hypervisor role it\ndoes not come with any universal machines.\n\n366\n00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:39,195\n[LAUGH] The magic of television.\n\n367\n00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:42,295\n>> Now fast forward a whole bunch.\n\n368\n00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:50,140\nAll right, so yeah, with hyper-v,\nas far as this exam is concerned.\n\n369\n00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,060\nWon't go too deep into all\nthe different settings and\n\n370\n00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,290\nsetting up fell over and flustering and\nall of this sort of stuff.\n\n371\n00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,380\nSo\n>> We'll get a little more deep into it\n\n372\n00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,310\nwhen we take our server classes.\n\n373\n00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,470\nWe'll take a look at the, a more\nextensive look at some of those options.\n\n374\n00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,330\nInstructions there for the client is\nmainly learning how to get the feature\n\n375\n00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,600\ninstalled, understanding what\nthe requirements are for that feature, and\n\n376\n00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,320\nthen being able to set up a virtual\nmachine, create your hard drives,\n\n377\n00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,030\ncreate your virtual networks,\nand then doing some snapshots\n\n378\n00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,640\nwhich I think we plan on covering\nall of that today for you.\n\n379\n00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,860\n>> All right, perfect.\n\n380\n00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,330\nAll right so the first thing\nis over in the action's bar.\n\n381\n00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,660\nWe'll click on new.\n\n382\n00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,930\nWe want to create a new virtual machine,\nfirst option there.\n\n383\n00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,390\n>> I like it.\n>> All right so\n\n384\n00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,860\nwe've got our little wizard,\nwe can read some of that stuff.\n\n385\n00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,040\nSo now up on this screen we need\nto name our virtual machine.\n\n386\n00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,870\nAll right.\n\n387\n00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,240\nSo I like to explain\nwhat it is I'm making.\n\n388\n00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,670\n>> Yeah, it should be descriptive so\nthat when you're looking at that list of\n\n389\n00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,000\nVirtual Machines you\nknow what that guy is.\n\n390\n00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,705\nNow are you a fan of the default location?\n\n391\n00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,370\n>> [LAUGH] No.\n\n392\n00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,780\nIt's a pretty crazy place\nto dump this thing right?\n\n393\n00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,930\nProgram data which I believe this,\nisn't it?\n\n394\n00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,210\n>> Its a hidden directory so\n\n395\n00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,520\nyou can browse to it without\nturning on your hidden folders.\n\n396\n00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,890\n>> Yeah, so I change my place.\n\n397\n00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,270\nAnd so, were going to put it on\nalert drive in a virtual's drive,\n\n398\n00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,620\nin a VM folder.\n\n399\n00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,080\nAnd I created these folders earlier.\n\n400\n00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,700\nAnd so,\nwe'll create a new folder for them.\n\n401\n00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,420\nWe'll call this Win 8-3.\n\n402\n00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,827\n>> Cool.\n>> All right, so this is where it's going\n\n403\n00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:34,410\nto store the configuration files for\nthis virtual machine.\n\n404\n00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,230\n>> Just for you guys at home, if he hadn't\ncreated that ahead of time, you could have\n\n405\n00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,490\ntyped that folder in there and\nit would've created it.\n\n406\n00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,900\nI cut and paste my name.\n\n407\n00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,970\nWhatever I've named that virtual machine\nin that first outline box, I will cut and\n\n408\n00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,650\npaste it into the path down there below.\n\n409\n00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,480\nWe'll learn about default paths,\nI think, in another show\n\n410\n00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,780\nwhere we can set the initial part of that\npath as a default, so if he wants all his\n\n411\n00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,580\nvirtuals to go into sequel and\nvirtuals, and then I can just cut and\n\n412\n00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,030\npaste the name to create a sub folder\nbecause I do like some people don't.\n\n413\n00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,625\nSome people like to keep it\nall loose in one big folder,\n\n414\n00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,350\nbecause you really don't ever browse\nto those directories directly.\n\n415\n00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,170\nThose aren't files that we're going to be\nable to manipulate ourselves, or anything\n\n416\n00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,240\nlike that, which is why they go into that\nhidden directory in the first place.\n\n417\n00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,030\nMe, being a little on the OCD side,\nI like to have them where I can see them.\n\n418\n00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,830\nOrganized and the whole nine.\n\n419\n00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,830\n>> And I've messed with my computer a lot.\n\n420\n00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,720\nI [COUGH] change things and\nformat stuff and\n\n421\n00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,480\nmove things around and having them-\n>> Indicated he re-solders the chips on\n\n422\n00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,345\nthe darn things.\n\n423\n00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, hey, you know, you.\n\n424\n00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,256\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:43,151\n>> All right,\n\n426\n00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:44,860\nmovin' right along, so-\n>> So,\n\n427\n00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,900\nwe're giving it a name\n>> And\n\n428\n00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,960\na location of where to store the virtual\nmachine configuration files at this point.\n\n429\n00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,450\nAll right, what's next?\n\n430\n00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,890\n>> So now we need to configure\nthe virtual memory for it, right?\n\n431\n00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:01,220\nSo we have this thing here, so\nthe start up memory is our first one.\n\n432\n00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,430\nSo when the virtual machine\ninitially fires up.\n\n433\n00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,716\n>> Right.\n>> It is going to have a certain amount of\n\n434\n00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:07,840\nRAM for its bootup.\n\n435\n00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,030\nSo, on this laptop right\nhere we have 8 GB or RAM.\n\n436\n00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,630\n>> Nice.\n\n437\n00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,350\n>> And so, we'll give the virtual\nmachine a little bit of [INAUDIBLE].\n\n438\n00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,950\nSo we're going to give it two\ngigabytes of start up memory.\n\n439\n00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,830\n>> That's typically where I would\nstart as well you know two gigs\n\n440\n00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,950\nat least I can always\ndrop that down later.\n\n441\n00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,090\nDuring the initial installation process I\nmight even give it a little bit extra and\n\n442\n00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,230\nthen drop it back down when I'm done.\n\n443\n00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,560\nBut two gigs sounds good to me.\n\n444\n00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,490\nI like that.\n\n445\n00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,908\nYou really got to think about it.\n\n446\n00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:43,500\nYou want to treat these just like\nany other machine on your network.\n\n447\n00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,210\nSo if the minimum memory requirements for\nWindows eight are two gigs then if you're\n\n448\n00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,230\nmaking a virtual machine with Windows\neight then you want to give it two gigs.\n\n449\n00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,371\nTreat it no different then\nyou would a physical machine.\n\n450\n00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:57,030\n>> That's a good point too.\n\n451\n00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,360\n>> It's the same requirements.\n\n452\n00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,650\nYou know, whether it's virtual or\nphysical,\n\n453\n00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,400\nit still has the same requirements.\n\n454\n00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,580\nNow there's a really cool check mark down\nbelow there with that dynamic memory for\n\n455\n00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,490\nthis virtual machine.\n\n456\n00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,200\nWhat's that all about?\n\n457\n00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,252\n>> Yeah so this dynamic memory,\nright, so the virtual machine so\n\n458\n00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:14,171\nwe have this start up memory.\n\n459\n00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:18,770\nSo it's initially going to take two\ngigabytes from our Host computer, right?\n\n460\n00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,140\nSo our physical computer is\ngoing to squirrel that away and\n\n461\n00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,920\nwhen,\n>> And\n\n462\n00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,850\nif we don't check that check mark\nthat's what it gets from then on out.\n\n463\n00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,230\n>> Correct.\n>> Every time it starts up it has two\n\n464\n00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,130\ngigs of memory.\n\n465\n00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,810\n>> Two gigs.\n\n466\n00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,970\nAnd it's going to keep that two gigs\nwhether it's using all of it or\n\n467\n00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,090\nnot it's going to reserve it for itself.\n\n468\n00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:40,220\nNow dynamic memory,\nI always use dynamic memory for my stuff.\n\n469\n00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,837\nSo what it does is, when a computer starts\nup, it's got to start all its services and\n\n470\n00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:47,583\nits processes,\nit's going to need all that RAM.\n\n471\n00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,834\nWell, after it begins to idle,\nit doesn't need all that RAM.\n\n472\n00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:54,486\nSo dynamic memory then,\nit will Release it, and\n\n473\n00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:57,792\nlet it go back to the host\noperating system.\n\n474\n00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:00,723\nIf for some reason it's doing\nsomething where it needs more memory,\n\n475\n00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:01,970\nit can take more.\n\n476\n00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,830\n>> So then, basically, your start up\nmemory becomes your max for your memory.\n\n477\n00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,100\nSo then as it needs less,\nit's going to reduce how much it's using.\n\n478\n00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,760\nIf it needs more,\nthey can take more up to that point.\n\n479\n00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,960\nAnd that's actually a feature that was\nnew to the Hyper V with the Server 2012,\n\n480\n00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,630\nand Windows 8.\n\n481\n00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,180\nThat was not available on 2008 R2.\n\n482\n00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,310\n>> All right.\n\n483\n00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,050\nDynamic memory?\n\n484\n00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,620\n>> Dynamic memory was not, no.\n\n485\n00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,730\nAnd it's, if you're trying,\nif you're limited on memory.\n\n486\n00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,750\nLike here we're on a laptop,\nwe only have 8 gigs.\n\n487\n00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:35,950\nWe don't have 64 gigs like I might have on\nmy Server and if needs laptops is already\n\n488\n00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:41,710\nusing 2 gigs, we just assign 2 gigs to\nthis virtual machine, 4 gigs are gone.\n\n489\n00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,600\nAll right?\nSo now I've only got 4 gigs left,\n\n490\n00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,150\nassuming were going to give 2 gigs to the\nother machine, I only got enough room for\n\n491\n00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,180\ntwo more virtual machine.\n\n492\n00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,510\nIf I was using dynamic memory, however,\nwhere they wouldn't be using that two gigs\n\n493\n00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,060\nall of the time, and I could potentially\nhave another virtual machine in there, but\n\n494\n00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,375\nthen you also run into\nthe issue of over allocating.\n\n495\n00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:05,175\nSorry I just keep dragging on and on,\n>> No, no, no.\n\n496\n00:25:05,175 --> 00:25:08,265\n>> But now all of a sudden you've got\nto worry about over allocating memory.\n\n497\n00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:11,135\nThat's the downside of using\ndynamic memory, is I might think,\n\n498\n00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:15,600\nwell you know, they're really only\nusing about MB of RAM or so, so\n\n499\n00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,820\nI'm going to make six virtual machines,\ngive them all four Gigs but use dynamic.\n\n500\n00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,080\nWell, if they all happen\nto peak at the same time,\n\n501\n00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,930\nthere's not enough memory to go around.\n\n502\n00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,890\nSo that can cause problems.\n\n503\n00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,060\n>> Yeah, when we get into\nthe dynamically expanding hard disks,\n\n504\n00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,100\nthat'll be another\n>> Exact same concept.\n\n505\n00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,010\n>> Over allocating, right?\n\n506\n00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,300\nIs that proper...?\n\n507\n00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,378\n>> Sorry, big words again.\n\n508\n00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:40,340\n>> [LAUGH] Right, okay.\n\n509\n00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,440\nSo now I have to configure the network for\nthis virtual machine.\n\n510\n00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,850\nWe're going to set up\nthe network differently.\n\n511\n00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,150\nWell, not really differently,\nbut in another step.\n\n512\n00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,800\nWe haven't done that quite yet.\n\n513\n00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,530\nSo there's none to pick from.\n\n514\n00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,030\nWe haven't set that up,\nso we'll do that later.\n\n515\n00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,690\nHere we select the virtual hard disk.\n\n516\n00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,760\nNow we can create a virtual hard disk,\n\n517\n00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,810\na VHD, right here in this menu and\nkeep on going forward with the wizard.\n\n518\n00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,600\nBut we're going to use a different\nmenu and set that up separately.\n\n519\n00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,140\nThen you can set your options,\nand all that kind of stuff.\n\n520\n00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,170\n>> Yeah, if you use the here,\n\n521\n00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,020\nif we take a look at what it says\nunder that first radio option,\n\n522\n00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,580\ncreate a dynamically expanding virtual\nhard drive, and there's no other choice.\n\n523\n00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,615\nSo if you wanted a dynamic drive,\nthen maybe you just create it here.\n\n524\n00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:29,605\nYou might have already created the drive,\nso\n\n525\n00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:33,985\nwe could choose use an Existing Virtual\nHard Drive if we had created it ahead of\n\n526\n00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:37,775\ntime or if we had a template, or we could\nchoose Attach a Virtual Hard Disk later,\n\n527\n00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:39,700\nwhich I think is what we're going to do.\n\n528\n00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,497\nSo that we can show you\nthat handy dandy wizard.\n\n529\n00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:43,930\n>> All right so\n\n530\n00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,660\nwe have our little summary her of all\nthe stuff we did and we will click finish.\n\n531\n00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,324\nThat goes pretty fast right.\n\n532\n00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:50,624\n>> That was sweet.\n\n533\n00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:55,324\n>> So now we have the virtual\nmachine created right now its just\n\n534\n00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:59,380\nan empty shell of configuration files.\n\n535\n00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,690\nAnd so the next thing to do.\n\n536\n00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,930\nWe got to create a hard drive.\n\n537\n00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,790\n>> We have to install\nthe operating system and\n\n538\n00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,150\napplications we want to\nput on that machine.\n\n539\n00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,230\n>> Now we're getting a little\nclose to break time.\n\n540\n00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,470\nSo I think we'll take our break now.\n\n541\n00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,330\nSo when we come back we'll build the VHD,\nthose options,\n\n542\n00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,700\nbuild a switch, and\nget this thing fired up.\n\n543\n00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,300\n>> Sounds like a lot of fun, doesn't it?\n\n544\n00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,990\n>> Sure does.\n\n545\n00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,999\nAll right,\nwe'll see you back in a few minutes.\n\n546\n00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:33,087\n[NOISE] And\n\n547\n00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:38,108\nwelcome back.\n\n548\n00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:39,980\nAll right.\n\n549\n00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,470\nWhere we left off,\nwe've created our virtual machine and so\n\n550\n00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:48,130\nnow it is time to make\nthe virtual hard drive for this.\n\n551\n00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,590\n>> We've got the configuration\nfile set up.\n\n552\n00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,940\nNow we need a hard drive so\nwe can install an operating system.\n\n553\n00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,090\n>> Perfect.\n\n554\n00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,680\nAll right, so moving right along.\n\n555\n00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,900\nAll right, so\nhere we are in the Hyper V Manager.\n\n556\n00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,280\nAnd over on this other side is New.\n\n557\n00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,720\n>> Same place we went to\ncreate that virtual machine,\n\n558\n00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,970\nnow we're going to create\na new virtual disk.\n\n559\n00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,770\n>> New hard disk.\n\n560\n00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,590\nNow, a virtual hard drive, right?\n\n561\n00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,880\nIf we were to browse to the folder\nof where we're creating it,\n\n562\n00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,050\nit's going to look like\na single little file.\n\n563\n00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,120\n>> You know,\nthis is probably one of the things I have\n\n564\n00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,910\nthe most trouble explaining, I think.\n\n565\n00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,580\nTo people that are new to virtualization\nis a virtual hard drive because it is,\n\n566\n00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,020\nit's just a file on your physical disk.\n\n567\n00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,620\nIf you go in and\n\n568\n00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:36,030\nlook in there you're going to have a file\nthat ends in a .vhd or a .vhdx extension.\n\n569\n00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:42,160\nYet to a virtual machine It\nsees that file as a hard drive.\n\n570\n00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,360\nWe can create partitions,\nwe can format those partitions,\n\n571\n00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,830\nwe can install operating systems.\n\n572\n00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,750\nAnd then to throw another curve in there,\nwe can even take that virtual hard drive\n\n573\n00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,370\nand boot our physical machine\nto the virtual hard drive.\n\n574\n00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,050\nWe'll save that for another time.\n\n575\n00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,790\nRight now,\nwe just want to get the basics of it.\n\n576\n00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,560\nWhat this client hyper v is all about.\n\n577\n00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,690\nLet's create as a new hard drive so\nwe can create a machine.\n\n578\n00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,190\n>> Here's a little intro page.\n\n579\n00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,950\nWe'll click past this guy.\n\n580\n00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,550\nWe always skip those intro pages.\n\n581\n00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,890\nBut I think it's good to know for\n\n582\n00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,640\nyou guys that are studying out\nthere you should read them.\n\n583\n00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,820\nThey do have some good information\non them but I always skip them.\n\n584\n00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,290\n>> Right, right on.\n>> You read them once and\n\n585\n00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,400\nyou really don't need to read them\nevery time you go through the wizard.\n\n586\n00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,100\n>> All right?\n\n587\n00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,510\nAll right so we, so all right, so\nwe have two different formats, right?\n\n588\n00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,820\nFor all our virtual hard drives, right?\n\n589\n00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,320\nSo we have a,\na VHD extension of a hard drive.\n\n590\n00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,710\nIt says here right,\nit can support hard drives up to 2040 GB\n\n591\n00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,370\n>> Prior to 2008 and Windows Server 12,\n\n592\n00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,720\nthat was the only format that we had.\n\n593\n00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,680\nNew to Windows 8 and\nServer 2012 Is this VHDX.\n\n594\n00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,290\n>> VHDX.\n>> And what's the advantage of VHDX?\n\n595\n00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:59,880\n>> So VHDX, right, it can take hard\ndrives up to 64 terabytes in size.\n\n596\n00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,670\n>> Big bad boys.\n\n597\n00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,270\n>> And it has this thing built into it,\n\n598\n00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:09,470\nto where it's a little bit\nmore resilient to failure.\n\n599\n00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:14,560\nAnd it has this metadata thing\nthat it writes changes to, so\n\n600\n00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,884\nlike if you have a sudden power failure,\nit can,\n\n601\n00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:23,600\nwon't really\n>> That is the idea.\n\n602\n00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,090\nIt's a little more resilient\nwhen it comes to failures.\n\n603\n00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,990\nYou know, if you're physical machine\nthat's hosting those virtual machines\n\n604\n00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,220\nfails, power failure, storms,\n\n605\n00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:37,180\nsomebody unplugs the machine and now what\nhappens to the virtual machines they\n\n606\n00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,090\nwere in the middle of writing\nto their hard drives as well.\n\n607\n00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:45,060\nAnd the new format handles that a little\nbit better because of the way it\n\n608\n00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,850\nwrites the changes before it commits them\nto the drive so what we need to know is\n\n609\n00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:54,105\njust that it supports larger volumes,\nand it's more resilient.\n\n610\n00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,491\n>> Yeah.\n\n611\n00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:59,000\nGoodness, it seems like\nit's the way to go.\n\n612\n00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,640\n>> It is.\n\n613\n00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,945\n>> And so, we will select it right for\nour purposes here.\n\n614\n00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:06,245\n>> But it would not be support by\nsome of my older personalizations.\n\n615\n00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:07,085\n>> That's true.\n\n616\n00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:12,397\n>> Like your older operating systems.\n\n617\n00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:13,035\n>> All right, so\n\n618\n00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:18,040\nnow we have what type a vhdx virtual\nhard drive that we want to create.\n\n619\n00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,300\nWe've got three right here,\nthree choices, we have a fixed sized,\n\n620\n00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,790\ndynamically expanding and\ndifferencing drives.\n\n621\n00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,650\nFixed size, so\nwhatever I guess size in gigabytes or\n\n622\n00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:36,240\nterabytes that we select for the drive\nis going to take all that space right?\n\n623\n00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,296\nIt's going to claim it all on its own and\n\n624\n00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:42,917\nit's going to be a massive VHD file,\nsort of.\n\n625\n00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:50,945\n>> Yeah so if we create a, let's say\nwe create a 64GB fixed size VHDX file,\n\n626\n00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:57,958\nthen it's going to claim 64GB\nof space off my physical drive.\n\n627\n00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:04,750\nIt's got to go ahead and grab that 64GB\nand say okay, Here is my VHD file.\n\n628\n00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,690\nSo you're allocating all of the space\nahead of time for that virtual hard drive.\n\n629\n00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,093\nIt can't be used by anything else.\n\n630\n00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:14,600\nGo ahead.\n\n631\n00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,080\nI was just going to say,\nwith a fix so it doesn't change size.\n\n632\n00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,620\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n633\n00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,800\n>> Hence the name fixed drive.\n\n634\n00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,660\nSo it's gonna grab that space and\nit's not gonna change it,\n\n635\n00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,090\neven if there's only 20 gigs of\ndata in that virtual hard drive,\n\n636\n00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,345\nthe VHDX file itself is still\ngonna be 64 gigs in size.\n\n637\n00:32:30,345 --> 00:32:31,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n638\n00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,010\nYep.\n\n639\n00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:37,360\nSo if that's not really the case that\nwe wanna go in some situations, right,\n\n640\n00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,740\nthere's dynamically expanding.\n\n641\n00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,640\nNow as far as the virtual machine is\nconcerned it's going to see a 64 gigabyte,\n\n642\n00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,650\nright, 2 terabyte drive, whatever.\n\n643\n00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:52,188\nBut, the actual size of the VHD file,\nright, on our,\n\n644\n00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:58,770\njust browsing to it, it's only gonna be as\nbig as the amount of space that it needs.\n\n645\n00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,160\n>> Yeah,\nthe amount of data that you put in there.\n\n646\n00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,820\nSo if you go ahead and\ncreated the same 64 gigabyte VHDX,\n\n647\n00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,080\nwe choose dynamically expanding once you\ncreated and go browse and look at it.\n\n648\n00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,380\nIt might be 500 megs in size.\n\n649\n00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,610\nThere's a little bit of overhead\ninitially when it creates it.\n\n650\n00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,500\nBut then as you add more data,\n\n651\n00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,510\nwhen we install our operation system,\nthat drive's gonna start expanding.\n\n652\n00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,310\nWhen we start adding applications that\ndrive continues to grow up to the max.\n\n653\n00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,960\nWhich would be the 64 gigs that we set.\n\n654\n00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,860\nThe nice thing about differencing drives\nis you're not having to allocate all that\n\n655\n00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,430\nspace at once.\n\n656\n00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:36,830\nAlthough, and that's another thing that\nthe VHDXs were supposed to give us was\n\n657\n00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,180\nbetter performance when it comes to to\nof these dynamically expanding drives.\n\n658\n00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,100\nBecause in the past,,\n\n659\n00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,470\nwith the dynamically expanding drive,\nthe performance was not very good.\n\n660\n00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,663\nBecause now what's going to happen in the\nmiddle of the operating system, writing to\n\n661\n00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:56,440\nthat VHD, all of a sudden has to stop and\ngrow and add space to the that VHD file.\n\n662\n00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,950\nWhich means the operating system,\nbasically has stop for a minute and\n\n663\n00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,850\ngrow this hard drive,\nwhich causes you performances issues.\n\n664\n00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,400\nAnd then at the same time we can end up\nfragmenting the VHD file itself, right?\n\n665\n00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,740\nWhat if it goes to grow and\nthere's no more contiguous space.\n\n666\n00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,650\nThere's another file sitting right there.\n\n667\n00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:17,800\nNow it's gotta go grab space from another\nlocation on the physical disk, so\n\n668\n00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,920\nmy VHD is actually in two\nparts on my hard drive,\n\n669\n00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,250\nwhich is not gonna be good for\nperformance.\n\n670\n00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:29,080\nAnd Microsoft will say that the VHDXs\nare supposed to handle that\n\n671\n00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,900\nmuch better as far as\nthe performance goes.\n\n672\n00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,900\nI will tell you that my experience in\nproduction environments, we don't use\n\n673\n00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,360\ndynamically expanding drives because\nof the performance hit that you take.\n\n674\n00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,490\nBut in test environments where I've got\na limited amount of space on my laptop but\n\n675\n00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:48,000\nI want to be able to set up two\ndomain controllers, a DNS server and\n\n676\n00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,260\nthree clients to do some testing with.\n\n677\n00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,700\nI'll use dynamic drives because\nI'm not worried about performance,\n\n678\n00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,060\nI'm the only one that's hitting them.\n\n679\n00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,558\nBut in a production environment where\nyou've got hundreds or thousands of users\n\n680\n00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:04,135\nhitting these servers and performance is\nkey, we don't go with dynamic drives.\n\n681\n00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,885\n>> Mm-hm, right on.\n\n682\n00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:11,050\nAll right [COUGH] So\nnow we have a differencing drive, right?\n\n683\n00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:11,659\nSo we have this.\n\n684\n00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:12,440\n>> It's different.\n\n685\n00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,175\n>> [LAUGH]\nSo we've got this.\n\n686\n00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:22,646\n>> [LAUGH] Sorry, I'm throwing\na curve ball, he's like wait, what?\n\n687\n00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:26,535\n>> [LAUGH] And\nI look at it as a query, all right,\n\n688\n00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:31,150\nso we have this apparent drive,\nand a child drive.\n\n689\n00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,870\n>> Yeah.\n\n690\n00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,599\nMike, you set up differencing drives\non some of your test stuff, right?\n\n691\n00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,135\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n692\n00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:42,447\nWhat a differencing drive does\nis if I wanna make a couple\n\n693\n00:35:42,447 --> 00:35:47,450\nvirtual machines that are both\nrunning Windows 8, all right.\n\n694\n00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,170\nI maybe I don't want to, normally what\nI would do is I would take two separate\n\n695\n00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:55,130\nvirtual machines, two separate virtual\nhard drives, install Windows 8 twice.\n\n696\n00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,500\nInstead of doing that route what I can do\nis I can take a single virtual hard drive,\n\n697\n00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,880\ninstall Windows 8 on it and\nthat becomes what we call our base drive.\n\n698\n00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,120\nAnd then when I make a new virtual\nmachine, instead of installing Window's 8,\n\n699\n00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,870\nI create a differencing drive and\n\n700\n00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,010\nI point that differencing\ndrive to that base hard drive.\n\n701\n00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,750\nAnd then the differencing\ndrive just contains the things\n\n702\n00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,530\nthat are different from that base.\n\n703\n00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,370\nSo I could have two Windows\n8 virtual machines,\n\n704\n00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,580\neach with their differencing drives,\npointed back to that single base.\n\n705\n00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,070\nBecause there's a lot of\nfiles that are in common,\n\n706\n00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,100\nall the Windows 8 files themselves.\n\n707\n00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,570\nIf I install Office on one of them\nthat goes into the differencing drive.\n\n708\n00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,490\nRight?\nAnd\n\n709\n00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,570\nif I install Photoshop in the other one,\nthat goes into the differencing drive, but\n\n710\n00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,140\nthey still point to the same base\nbecause they're still running the same.\n\n711\n00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,780\nAll the common files\nare stored in that base drive.\n\n712\n00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,150\n>> So in those two machines then that\nare on the differencing drives even though\n\n713\n00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,950\nthey have the same parent drive,\ncan you run both of them at the same time?\n\n714\n00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,790\n>> Absolutely.\n\n715\n00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,630\nAbsolutely.\n\n716\n00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,870\nYou can run, again, another performance\nissue that you'll run into.\n\n717\n00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,600\nYou have too many pointing\nback to that base,\n\n718\n00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,110\nyou gonna end up with\nsome discontention there.\n\n719\n00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,930\nThere's also the problem\nof performance issue,\n\n720\n00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,140\ncuz it has to hit both the differencing\ndrive, and that base drive.\n\n721\n00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,660\n>> So you have performance issues there.\n\n722\n00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,800\nReally, we use the differencing drives\na lot of times for again test environments\n\n723\n00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,720\nwhere I'm not really concerned with\nthe performance and I'm limited on space.\n\n724\n00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,830\nI use them all the time.\n\n725\n00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:34,370\nI have on my Hyper-V server, I have a base\ndrive that has 2012 installed on it.\n\n726\n00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,220\nI have a base driver with 2008 R2,\na base driver with Windows 8,\n\n727\n00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,100\na base driver with Windows 7,\net cetera, et cetera.\n\n728\n00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,800\nSo when I wanna throw out a new machine,\n\n729\n00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,230\nI don't have to install\nthe operating system all over again.\n\n730\n00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,020\nI just grab a new virtual machine\nlike we did in that first wizard,\n\n731\n00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,980\ncreate a differencing drive, and\npoint it to whichever base I want.\n\n732\n00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,070\nAnd I instantly have a machine that I\ncan goof around with, test, do whatever,\n\n733\n00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,370\nblow it away, and throw it all away,\nand I still got the base drive there.\n\n734\n00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,240\nSo I don't have to install the operating\nsystem over and over and over again.\n\n735\n00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it speeds up your\n\n736\n00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,060\ntest environments more than anything.\n\n737\n00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But again,\n\n738\n00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,590\nsomething that you're not gonna\nuse in production environment.\n\n739\n00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,540\nIt's really limited to test environments.\n\n740\n00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,390\n>> Yeah I need to set up differencing\ndrives on mine cause I do it the long way.\n\n741\n00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,390\nRight.\n>> Still throw the disk in and.\n\n742\n00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,920\n>> Mm-hm.\nEach virtual machine,\n\n743\n00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,140\nI create its own little hard drive and\ninstall it there and\n\n744\n00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,400\nof course I have gotten pretty pretty\nfast at it but not quite as fast as\n\n745\n00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,810\njust throwing up a differencing drive and-\n>> Well\n\n746\n00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,870\nif we have time maybe\nwe can create one here.\n\n747\n00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,500\nWe'll create our virtual machine and then\nwe'll create a second virtual machine with\n\n748\n00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,190\na differencing drive and\nsee how fast it is.\n\n749\n00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,843\nIf we have time.\n\n750\n00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:39,420\n>> Right on.\n\n751\n00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,800\nSo for our purposes,\n\n752\n00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,330\nI think today we're just going choose\na dynamically expanding drive.\n\n753\n00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,430\n>> Okay.\n>> All right so the name of the drive now,\n\n754\n00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,760\nI guess just whatever you want to name it,\n\n755\n00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,220\nI like to keep it the same\nname as the virtual machine.\n\n756\n00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,610\n>> What I typically do on my\nsystems is because in the future,\n\n757\n00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:04,680\nI might want to add a second or\nthird or fourth virtual disk.\n\n758\n00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,570\nJust like you would on a physical machine,\nif you want another drive you go out and\n\n759\n00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,270\nbuy another drive from Best Buy or\nNewegg or whatever.\n\n760\n00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,380\nVirtual machines, you just wipe\nout a new virtual hard drive.\n\n761\n00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,970\nSo what I will typically do is say\nname of the machine, underscore one.\n\n762\n00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,590\nOr something like that to indicate this\nwas the first hard drive for that machine.\n\n763\n00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,380\nBut that's just me.\n\n764\n00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,400\n>> Right on.\nThen for\n\n765\n00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,740\nthe location we're not going\nto stick it in this folder.\n\n766\n00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,500\nWe're going to put it back in the other\nfolder because whether it's right or\n\n767\n00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,135\nwrong.\n\n768\n00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:35,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But I like to keep things a little\n\n769\n00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,930\norganized.\n\n770\n00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,520\n>> Yeah,\nI don't like the default location,\n\n771\n00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,390\nthey're going into the public folders.\n\n772\n00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,287\nI guess in a shared environment if\nmultiple people use that machine,\n\n773\n00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:49,458\nit does ensure they'll have\naccess to that VHD or VHDX.\n\n774\n00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,625\nBut I definitely like to create my own.\n\n775\n00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:56,657\nAgain, this is where we would\nrather have a separate Physical\n\n776\n00:39:56,657 --> 00:40:02,016\ndisk with separate disk IO to put\nthese virtual hard-drives on.\n\n777\n00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:04,420\n>> All right so\nthere we've go tour location.\n\n778\n00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,980\nRight?\n\n779\n00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,970\nAnd we'll continue forward.\n\n780\n00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,850\nAll right, so\nthis is gonna be the size of our disk.\n\n781\n00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:16,940\nNow the minimum size for\na 64-bit edition of Windows is 20 gigs.\n\n782\n00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,075\nSo for our purposes even though it's\na DNO, we could assign all that.\n\n783\n00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:23,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it would only take what it needs.\n\n784\n00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,060\nWe'll just do 20 gigs.\n\n785\n00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,050\n>> Can you install Windows 8 in 20 gigs?\n\n786\n00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,090\n>> Pretty sure.\n\n787\n00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,860\n>> All right,\n>> All right.\n\n788\n00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,180\nSo then, all right.\n\n789\n00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,518\nThere we go.\n\n790\n00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:33,060\n>> Some cool other\n\n791\n00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,150\noptions there that we should probably\nmention while we're on this screen.\n\n792\n00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,640\nAs you see the option to copy the contents\nof the specified physical disk.\n\n793\n00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,160\nHow about that?\n\n794\n00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,780\nIt'll take your computer,\nand virtualize it.\n\n795\n00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,370\nCopy the contents of your drive.\n\n796\n00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,838\nLike if I had a data drive with\na whole bunch of tools on it,\n\n797\n00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,470\nand I want this virtual\nmachine to have access to it.\n\n798\n00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,520\nThere's other ways I can do it, but\n\n799\n00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,178\nI can just copy the drive and\nattach that to my virtual hard-drive.\n\n800\n00:40:57,178 --> 00:40:57,790\nIt's kinda cool.\n\n801\n00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,090\nMake a back up of your drive.\n\n802\n00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,715\nMake a virtual hard drive of\none of your physical disks.\n\n803\n00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:03,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pretty cool stuff.\n\n804\n00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,090\nRight?\n>> All right,\n\n805\n00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,260\nmake a VHD of your physical disks?\n\n806\n00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,100\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n807\n00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,985\n>> Right?\n>> Absolutely.\n\n808\n00:41:07,985 --> 00:41:10,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, very cool.\n\n809\n00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,250\nAnyway.\n\n810\n00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,230\n>> Right On.\n\n811\n00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,281\nAll right, so there we go,\n20 gig, 20 gig size.\n\n812\n00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:16,210\nRight?\nMove forward.\n\n813\n00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,070\nWe have our summary screen.\n\n814\n00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,060\nAnd all right, finish up the wizard.\n\n815\n00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,980\nSo now we have the hard-drive created.\n\n816\n00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,290\n>> Why don't we go take a look at it.\n\n817\n00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,790\nLet's open up Window's Explorer and\ngo see.\n\n818\n00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,837\nCuz we created a, do you leave it at the,\nno you change it to 20 gigs.\n\n819\n00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:36,087\nBut since it's a dynamically\nexpanding drive,\n\n820\n00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:41,327\nyou'll see that it's actually\nonly four megabytes in size.\n\n821\n00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pretty darn cool.\n\n822\n00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,340\n>> That was pretty sweet.\n\n823\n00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,420\nSo, yeah, there's our VHD, REHD file.\n\n824\n00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,680\n>> Right.\n>> Sweet.\n\n825\n00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,630\nAll right, so\nnow that we've go that, and so\n\n826\n00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,820\nnow, [COUGH] we'll click on our\nvirtual machine we created earlier.\n\n827\n00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,870\nAnd go to the settings for it.\n\n828\n00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,874\nAnd some of the settings for\nthat virtual machine.\n\n829\n00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:05,469\nRight?\nAdding hardware.\n\n830\n00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:08,705\nRight?, The basic bios\nsettings like whether or\n\n831\n00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:10,795\nnot you want Num Lock turned on.\n\n832\n00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,895\nThe thing boots up better.\n\n833\n00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:15,585\n>> Yeah, I almost like to think\nof these settings as my bios for\n\n834\n00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:18,035\nthe virtual machine, but\nthat's what you're looking at there.\n\n835\n00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:22,065\nLike that first option, add hardware, if I\nwanted to add a physical network adapter,\n\n836\n00:42:22,065 --> 00:42:23,080\nor another network adapter.\n\n837\n00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,240\nProbably shouldn't say physical.\n\n838\n00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,640\nOr a fiber channel adapter or\nsomething like that.\n\n839\n00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,290\nWe go down through that list,\nwe see memory.\n\n840\n00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,980\nSome of these option, depending,\nlike these are all changeable right now.\n\n841\n00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,290\nIf the virtual machine was running, a lot\nof these options would be grayed out.\n\n842\n00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,200\nWe wouldn't be able to change them\nwhile the machine is running.\n\n843\n00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,090\nIt is nice to know that you're not stuck\nwith what you put in that initial wizard.\n\n844\n00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:49,690\nIf you change your mind I can can come\nback here and adjust it as I need to.\n\n845\n00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,640\n>> Yep.\nSo yeah, a good thing to browse through\n\n846\n00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,530\nthese options and see the kinds of things\nthat can be changed after the fact.\n\n847\n00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,440\nLike what Mike said,\nchange the memory settings.\n\n848\n00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,630\nWe can, if we have a multi-core processor.\n\n849\n00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,456\nIf we have these eight core processors.\n\n850\n00:43:06,456 --> 00:43:07,110\nRight?\nSo\n\n851\n00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,185\nwe could assign two of those\ncores to a virtual machine.\n\n852\n00:43:11,185 --> 00:43:12,970\nRight?\nWith this screen right here,\n\n853\n00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,800\nnumber of virtual processors.\n\n854\n00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,970\nAnd it will take that off and to I guess\nmake better utilization of hardware.\n\n855\n00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,710\n>> You might have an application that\ncan take advantage of dual cores.\n\n856\n00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,400\nSo I want to make sure that my virtual\nmachine has dual cores so it can use them.\n\n857\n00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,170\nSo you're just virtualizing that for it.\n\n858\n00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,030\n>> IDE controllers and SCSI controllers.\n\n859\n00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,620\nNetwork adapters.\n\n860\n00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,830\n>> That should be from A plus.\n\n861\n00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,929\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH] yeah, yeah.\n\n862\n00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:41,580\n>> [LAUGH] But just like a physical\nmachine, you know we can go in there,\n\n863\n00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,710\nwe can work with the hardware\nthat's in this machine.\n\n864\n00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,240\nThe virtual hardware\nthat's in this machine.\n\n865\n00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,690\n>> Yep.\n\n866\n00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,601\nAnd so\nwe need to attach a drive to this guy, and\n\n867\n00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:51,730\nwe created our virtual hard-drive.\n\n868\n00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,960\nAnd just like your physical machines\nIDE is limited to two devices per\n\n869\n00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,700\nchannel you get two channels in there so\nI've got four slots per IDE based drives.\n\n870\n00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,420\n>> Just like the real ones.\n\n871\n00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,789\nRight?\n>> Just like the real thing.\n\n872\n00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:09,801\n>> All right, so\nthen on this IDE controller right here.\n\n873\n00:44:09,801 --> 00:44:11,764\nRight?\nSo we chose a hard-drive.\n\n874\n00:44:11,764 --> 00:44:12,504\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n875\n00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:16,351\n>> So now we need to go and\nfind the disk that we created earlier\n\n876\n00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,835\nAll right, so there we go,\nwe will apply the changes,\n\n877\n00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,900\nand just like a physical computer.\n\n878\n00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,230\nRight?\nIf you're adding a hard drive to it,\n\n879\n00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,495\nyou'll have to shut your computer down.\n\n880\n00:44:35,495 --> 00:44:36,910\n>> Yes.\n>> Like Mike said earlier,\n\n881\n00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,400\nif the virtual machine is on and\n\n882\n00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,040\nrunning, almost all these\noptions will be grayed out.\n\n883\n00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,430\nWe can't change it.\n\n884\n00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,690\nIf that does appear,\n\n885\n00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,830\nmight have to shut that virtual machine\ndown to add things like hard drives.\n\n886\n00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,890\n>> Yeah, you really got to think about\nit just like a physical machine.\n\n887\n00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:55,240\nIf you were gonna add a new hard drive to\nyour IDE channel or a new DVD drive, or\n\n888\n00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,790\nsomething like that or\na new network adapter for that matter.\n\n889\n00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,050\nYou would power the machine down,\nyou'd install that piece of hardware, and\n\n890\n00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:01,560\nyou'd reboot it.\n\n891\n00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,292\nIt's the same thing with\nthe virtual machines.\n\n892\n00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:06,640\nYou're gonna have to shut them down, make\nthat hardware configuration change and\n\n893\n00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,160\nthen turn them back on.\n\n894\n00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,290\nSwitching from one network\nto another though.\n\n895\n00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,060\nI don't have to turn my machine off.\n\n896\n00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,450\nRight?\nTo unplug that network cable.\n\n897\n00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,020\nSo, that I wouldn't have to turn\nthe virtual machine off for.\n\n898\n00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,540\nIf I'm gonna change the amount of\nmemory that's in my physical machine,\n\n899\n00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,900\nI gotta turn it off.\n\n900\n00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,940\nVirtual machine, the same thing,\n\n901\n00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,940\nif I'm gonna change the amount of memory,\nI'm gonna have to turn that machine off.\n\n902\n00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,190\n>> All right.\n\n903\n00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,970\nI jumped out of this wizard, but\nwe'll need one more thing in here for\n\n904\n00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,020\nour virtual machine.\n\n905\n00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,751\nNow we've attached a hard drive.\n\n906\n00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:37,050\nRight?\nIf we turn the thing on,\n\n907\n00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,810\nwe need to install Windows to it.\n\n908\n00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:39,650\nRight?\n>> We do. It would help.\n\n909\n00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,530\n>> Just like a real computer.\n\n910\n00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,350\nSo in here on our.\n\n911\n00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,740\n>> Unless you want to start it up without\nan operating system to show them it's just\n\n912\n00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,970\nlike a physical machine.\n\n913\n00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:47,640\n>> All right, you wanna do that?\n\n914\n00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,184\n>> Well let's do that.\nLet's\n\n915\n00:45:48,184 --> 00:45:49,900\nsee\n>> Nice.\n\n916\n00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,675\n>> Here we go.\n\n917\n00:45:50,675 --> 00:45:52,340\nYeah,\n>> Connect.\n\n918\n00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,400\n>> So just like if you went and\nbuilt your own machine.\n\n919\n00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,330\nBought all the motherboard, the processor,\nyour memory, all your devices,\n\n920\n00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:03,140\nthrew your hard-drive in there and\nthen try to turn it on.\n\n921\n00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,090\n>> What's it gonna say?\n\n922\n00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,240\n>> Boot failure.\n\n923\n00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,580\nNo operating system found.\n\n924\n00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,170\n>> That's a little small.\n\n925\n00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:15,220\nOnce we get this thing fired up we\ncan bump up resolutions a little bit.\n\n926\n00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,160\nBut yeah, sure enough.\n\n927\n00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,850\nBoot failure.\n\n928\n00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:20,570\nReboot and select proper boot device, or\ninsert boot media and select boot device.\n\n929\n00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,300\n>> So let's insert some boot media.\n\n930\n00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,080\n>> Let's do that Mike.\n\n931\n00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,330\n>> Let's do that.\n\n932\n00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,090\n>> All right, so we'll shut this guy down.\n\n933\n00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,782\nActually we'll turn it off.\n\n934\n00:46:28,782 --> 00:46:33,490\nAll right, so\nthen back into our system settings.\n\n935\n00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,120\nRight?\n\n936\n00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,910\nI guess we could have left it on.\n\n937\n00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,580\n>> Yeah, just like on a real machine,\nyou could definitely open up your DVD\n\n938\n00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,770\ndrive with the machine powered up, but\nit's not that it takes all that long.\n\n939\n00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,350\nAnd a lot of these setting are.\n\n940\n00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,150\nI'm like you.\n\n941\n00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,080\nI like the wizards.\n\n942\n00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,940\nI like going in here.\n\n943\n00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,920\nI'm a right-clicker, but\nfor those of you studying.\n\n944\n00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,300\nI can't really see it in that bottom right\nhand corner, but most of these options\n\n945\n00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:01,300\nthat we're selecting are also available\nover there in the action's a pane.\n\n946\n00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,420\nYeah, so you can get to the settings for\nthat machine down at the bottom.\n\n947\n00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,560\nThere's the same thing we're\ngoing to see if you right-click\n\n948\n00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,040\ndown there in the details pane on win8-3.\n\n949\n00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,800\nSame options there on the bottom.\n\n950\n00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,450\n>> All right,\nis that where you go to do stuff?\n\n951\n00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:13,950\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n952\n00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,800\n>> I usually turn the actions pane off,\n\n953\n00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,050\nbecause I want that extra space over\nthere, or I squeeze it down a little bit.\n\n954\n00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:19,720\nI'm a right clicker.\n\n955\n00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,610\n>> All right, yeah,\nI just get familiar going way around.\n\n956\n00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,590\n>> And I have noticed in some\nof these new Windows in 2012 and\n\n957\n00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,790\nin Windows 8, they start taking\naway my right-click capabilities.\n\n958\n00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:36,000\nAnd they're forcing you to go to the\nactions pane, and I'm like no you didn't.\n\n959\n00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,650\n>> All right.\nSo, all right, so yeah, in here for\n\n960\n00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,570\nthe, the DVD drive option.\n\n961\n00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,590\nRight?\n>> So we chose, an image file.\n\n962\n00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,668\nRight?\nSo we're gonna load up an ISO,\n\n963\n00:47:49,668 --> 00:47:54,708\nan image of a DVD and\na Windows 8 installation DVD.\n\n964\n00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:59,136\n>> So we could really say\nwe're taking a virtual DVD and\n\n965\n00:47:59,136 --> 00:48:05,486\nputting that virtual DVD into a virtual\nDVD drive in our virtual computer.\n\n966\n00:48:05,486 --> 00:48:06,570\nPretty sweet.\n\n967\n00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:07,403\n>> That's pretty heavy.\n\n968\n00:48:07,403 --> 00:48:11,610\n>> It is.\n\n969\n00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:15,170\n>> All right, so we have this evaluation\nedition of Windows 8, 64 bit.\n\n970\n00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,100\n>> Nice.\n>> Sort of open this up.\n\n971\n00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,276\nAnd so, now it's gonna be like the disc\nis in the drive of the computer.\n\n972\n00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:24,180\n>> And that's the way you guys\nat home can think about it.\n\n973\n00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,470\nIt's just like taking, you know, pushing\nthe eject button on your DVD drive,\n\n974\n00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,710\ndumping that physical disc in there,\nand then closing your drawer.\n\n975\n00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,420\n>> All right.\nLet's start this guy up, right?\n\n976\n00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,050\n>> Yep.\n\n977\n00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,030\nAnd, since there's nothing on the hard\ndrive, it can't boot to the hard drive,\n\n978\n00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,490\nso it's gonna boot to that DVD.\n\n979\n00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:42,695\nWe don't have to press the any key\nto boot to the DVD in this case.\n\n980\n00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:44,861\n>> All right, now.\n\n981\n00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:47,300\n>> Because I always have trouble\nfinding that any key anyway.\n\n982\n00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,712\n>> It's on the bottom of the keyboard.\n\n983\n00:48:49,712 --> 00:48:51,615\n>> Is it underneath?\n\n984\n00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:52,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n985\n00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,300\nOkay.\n\n986\n00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,060\n>> Gotcha.\n>> So, you know.\n\n987\n00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,560\n>> Now I know.\nAnd knowing is half the battle.\n\n988\n00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,470\n>> Knowing is half the battle.\n\n989\n00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,480\nSo, and just like a physical machine,\n\n990\n00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,412\nI feel like I'm gonna say that a lot,\njust like in a physical machine.\n\n991\n00:49:04,412 --> 00:49:07,651\n>> [LAUGH] It gets a little repetitive,\nbut it's true.\n\n992\n00:49:07,651 --> 00:49:08,663\n>> Yeah.\nSo, you know,\n\n993\n00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:11,170\nthere's nothing on that\nblank virtual hard drive.\n\n994\n00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:11,690\n>> Correct.\n>> Right?\n\n995\n00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:17,320\nWe put in a DVD into\nthe little fake DVD drive.\n\n996\n00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,860\n>> And the Windows 8 media is bootable,\nso there we have our setup.exe.\n\n997\n00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,060\n>> Yep, and our installation screen.\n\n998\n00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,440\nAnd, just like installing Windows 8.\n\n999\n00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,135\nSo, we'll go through and\nwe will begin the installation process.\n\n1000\n00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:35,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, and set this guy up.\n\n1001\n00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,390\n>> And it's surprisingly fast.\n\n1002\n00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,930\nSome people might be thinking,\noh, this is gonna take forever.\n\n1003\n00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:45,000\nAnd it's really very quick,\nyou'll be surprised.\n\n1004\n00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,930\nNot as quick as applying the winval\ndirectly, but still very quick.\n\n1005\n00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:59,230\n>> So there's our VHD file, right there,\nyeah, a little on the small side.\n\n1006\n00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,780\nIt says 20 gigabytes.\n\n1007\n00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,550\nSo, that's the size of it,\nand that's what we said.\n\n1008\n00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:11,090\nWhat it sees, yep, and\nthen just installing it on a regular PC.\n\n1009\n00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:11,740\n>> Yeah.\n\n1010\n00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,130\n>> Right, so, partitions it off, right,\nit's got it's little thing there.\n\n1011\n00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:17,180\n>> Creates that reserve space.\n\n1012\n00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,820\n>> And there it goes.\n\n1013\n00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,400\n>> Nice.\n>> Starting right up.\n\n1014\n00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,890\nAll right, so,\nwe're coming up on break here.\n\n1015\n00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,722\n>> It's like you planned this out,\nthat was good timing.\n\n1016\n00:50:27,722 --> 00:50:32,550\n>> So, during the break, we're going\nto let this guy finish installing.\n\n1017\n00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,570\nWe'll get this thing turned back up.\n\n1018\n00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:39,277\nWe have one more thing to do, and that is\nto create a virtual switch so this virtual\n\n1019\n00:50:39,277 --> 00:50:43,930\nmachine can reach out and talk to other\npeople, just like it was a real machine.\n\n1020\n00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,380\n>> It's lonely right now.\n\n1021\n00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,000\nIt's lonely.\n\n1022\n00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,150\nIt only has itself to talk to.\n\n1023\n00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,980\n>> Yep, well, we're going to fix that.\n\n1024\n00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,670\n>> Good deal.\n\n1025\n00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,770\n>> All right, when we come back,\nwe'll see you then.\n\n1026\n00:50:57,478 --> 00:51:04,850\nOkay, all right, and welcome back again.\n\n1027\n00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:09,700\nAll right, so the virtual\nmachine installed during break.\n\n1028\n00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:14,019\nAnd, you know, we're gonna skip ahead,\nnot like skip ahead a whole.\n\n1029\n00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:20,970\nBut, I created two virtual machines that\nI've signed in, created user accounts,\n\n1030\n00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:26,540\nand set the resolution,\nmostly as it comes across on the TV here.\n\n1031\n00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,350\n>> We got to see you creating that one and\nwe got all the way up to the point where\n\n1032\n00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:33,010\nit was installing the operating system,\nbut then, to speed things along in our\n\n1033\n00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,040\nbroadcast here, we've got two machines\nthat we went through the same wizards,\n\n1034\n00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,550\nchose the same options, and, as Nate said,\nmade a couple configuration changes that\n\n1035\n00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,580\nare gonna make em easier\nto see on the screen here.\n\n1036\n00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,045\nAnd, signing in, the first time a user\nsigns in, you guys know from your other\n\n1037\n00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:50,934\nepisodes, the first time a user\nlogs into that Windows machine,\n\n1038\n00:51:50,934 --> 00:51:53,160\nit's gotta generate the profile and\nall of that.\n\n1039\n00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,742\nSo, in order to skip all that,\nwe've got a couple prepared for us.\n\n1040\n00:51:58,742 --> 00:51:59,460\n>> Yup.\n\n1041\n00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,090\n>> Let's do it.\n\n1042\n00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:00,620\nAll right.\n\n1043\n00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,930\nSo we've got two machines created\nwith Windows 8 in installed.\n\n1044\n00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:07,200\nDo we want to fire one up and\ntake a peek at it first, or\n\n1045\n00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,010\ndo we want to jump right into getting\nthese guys to talking to each other?\n\n1046\n00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,986\n>> Yeah, let's fire this thing up.\n\n1047\n00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:16,321\n>> Let's take a look at one, let's see.\n\n1048\n00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:20,170\n>> All right, so, we got this\nfirst guy here, Win 8, number one.\n\n1049\n00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:20,830\nAll right.\n\n1050\n00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,410\nAnd we didn't quite go through\nsome of these settings.\n\n1051\n00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,220\nI think after,\n\n1052\n00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,950\nwe'll touch on before we end as the-\n>> Well,\n\n1053\n00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:30,520\nwhile you're choosing that I could\ntalk about some of those guys there.\n\n1054\n00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,080\nYou have the option to connect,\n\n1055\n00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,340\nyou obviously have the option to get into\nthe settings, you can connect to it, and\n\n1056\n00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,600\nI think that's what Nate's gonna pick,\nor you could click Start.\n\n1057\n00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,120\nAnd one of the differences,\nif you've had any experience with\n\n1058\n00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,250\nsome of the prior client\nvirtualization technologies,\n\n1059\n00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:50,170\nlike Virtual Box or Virtual PC,\nor something like that.\n\n1060\n00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,170\nWe're used to launching\nthis virtual machine up.\n\n1061\n00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:56,730\nIt opens up in a window, just like any\nother application like word or outlook or\n\n1062\n00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,630\nwhatever.\n\n1063\n00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:00,880\nAnd if I close that window,\nI'm closing that virtual machine,\n\n1064\n00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,650\nI'm shutting it down.\n\n1065\n00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:06,270\nClient side hyperV, as well as hyperV up\non my servers, is a little different.\n\n1066\n00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,400\nThese guys are gonna run as a service.\n\n1067\n00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,410\nYou can go ahead and\nstart it while I'm talking, if you want.\n\n1068\n00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,260\nYou don't have to wait for me.\n\n1069\n00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,000\nI know I get a little long winded here.\n\n1070\n00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000\nBut these guys run like a service\nin the background basically.\n\n1071\n00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,300\nSo if Nate was to close\nthis window right now.\n\n1072\n00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,030\nWhy don't you?\nGo ahead and\n\n1073\n00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,150\nclose it,\nright in the middle of it booting up.\n\n1074\n00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,380\nToo late, but close it anyway.\n\n1075\n00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,390\nYou'll see that in the statistics\nwindow there that it's still running,\n\n1076\n00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,870\nit's still using 14, down to 4.\n\n1077\n00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,390\nIt's got 750 megs of RAM.\n\n1078\n00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:33,100\nSo, that machine is still running.\n\n1079\n00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,100\nIf it was connected to a network, I could\nping it, I could connect to shares on it.\n\n1080\n00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,760\nSo, unlike some of those other\nclient side virtualizations,\n\n1081\n00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,590\nthe window does not have to be open.\n\n1082\n00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,410\nAnd the reason I say that,\n\n1083\n00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:48,890\nthat's why you see when you right\nclick you have the right click start.\n\n1084\n00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:52,580\nYou can start it up without\nactually connecting to it.\n\n1085\n00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:53,330\nBeautiful.\n\n1086\n00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,100\n>> It's pretty sweet.\n\n1087\n00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,680\n>> It really is.\n\n1088\n00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,810\n>> You just go through and\n\n1089\n00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:59,320\nstart all the guys up, and you don't\nhave to have a bunch of windows open.\n\n1090\n00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,300\n>> Or you can even set it up to where they\nstart automatically when we start up our\n\n1091\n00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,280\nmachine.\n\n1092\n00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,910\nWe can even delay the start in\nbetween the different machines,\n\n1093\n00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,020\nso they're not all booting\nup at the same time.\n\n1094\n00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:08,820\nIt's very cool.\n\n1095\n00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,750\n>> Man, Mike, that's heavy duty.\n\n1096\n00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,099\n>> It is.\nSo, now we've got this machine up and\n\n1097\n00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,260\nrunning, let's connect back to it.\n\n1098\n00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,170\nYou can right click connect,\n\n1099\n00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:18,200\nyou can even double click on the little\nthumbnail down there at the bottom.\n\n1100\n00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,480\nIsn't that beautiful?\n\n1101\n00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,444\nSeattle?\n\n1102\n00:54:20,444 --> 00:54:24,425\nI wonder why they picked Seattle.\n\n1103\n00:54:24,425 --> 00:54:27,520\n[LAUGH]\n>> I don't know, do you know?\n\n1104\n00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,230\n>> It couldn't be a Microsoft thing,\ncould it?\n\n1105\n00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,858\n>> I don't know.\n>> You know, being based out of,\n\n1106\n00:54:32,858 --> 00:54:36,028\nno, probably has nothing to do with that.\n\n1107\n00:54:36,028 --> 00:54:37,310\n>> All right, so, there we are.\n\n1108\n00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:42,350\nThe home screen, or\nthe lock screen that we all know and\n\n1109\n00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:48,230\nlove, and like I said before,\nI've already signed into these machines.\n\n1110\n00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:52,346\n>> So we don't have to see\nthe old welcome to Windows,\n\n1111\n00:54:52,346 --> 00:54:57,830\nlet's learn how to use Windows 8,\nwhich you guys will see enough.\n\n1112\n00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:58,660\n>> There we go.\n\n1113\n00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,390\nRight?\n\n1114\n00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,620\nSo, there's a virtual computer.\n\n1115\n00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:08,070\nWe can browse to the desktop there, and\nit's got it's little folder structure.\n\n1116\n00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,050\n>> And I tell you what, go ahead and,\nright now I think you have a full screen,\n\n1117\n00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:17,130\nwhy don't you bring it down, just so\nthat everybody at home can see that\n\n1118\n00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:23,370\nthat virtual machine is running in\na window, or were viewing it through\n\n1119\n00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:26,640\nthis basically a type of remote desktop\nconnection that were doing here.\n\n1120\n00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,512\nBut, it's got its own task bar,\n\n1121\n00:55:28,512 --> 00:55:32,020\nit's a separate machine from\nthe one he is physically operating.\n\n1122\n00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:35,560\nAnd its easily to get\nconfused with that too, but\n\n1123\n00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,320\nwe'll talk about that at some other point.\n\n1124\n00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,900\nYep, there's our virtual machine up and\nrunning.\n\n1125\n00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,456\n>> Right.\n>> Just like any other machine at\n\n1126\n00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:42,958\nthis point.\n\n1127\n00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:47,697\n>> Just like any other machine,\neven the Windows key works on it, so\n\n1128\n00:55:47,697 --> 00:55:52,625\nwe can do a Windows Key+X, and\nwe can get our little quick menu and.\n\n1129\n00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:56,458\nIt's like a regular computer.\n\n1130\n00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:59,620\n>> And I tell you once you full screen it,\nyou really almost can't tell.\n\n1131\n00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,130\nLike, you could take that laptop,\nhand it to somebody and\n\n1132\n00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:05,260\nif we hid that bar across the top,\nwhich you can definitely unpin,\n\n1133\n00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,330\nthey wouldn't even realize that they\nwere working on a virtual machine.\n\n1134\n00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,682\n>> Yeah.\n\n1135\n00:56:10,682 --> 00:56:13,800\n>> I have on one of my laptops at home,\nI have\n\n1136\n00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,375\na virtual machine that's running OS X,\nSnow Kitty, Snow Leopard.\n\n1137\n00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One of those things.\n\n1138\n00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:25,130\nAnd so it's an Alienware laptop, so I can\nfull screen this virtual machine, and\n\n1139\n00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:25,990\nhide my bars.\n\n1140\n00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,360\nAnd people walk by and\nthey see the Alienware laptop, yet\n\n1141\n00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,450\nit's running an Apple operating system.\n\n1142\n00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,572\nConfuses some folks.\n\n1143\n00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:32,470\nLike, woah, oh my gosh.\n\n1144\n00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,710\n>> What are you doing there.\n\n1145\n00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:36,850\n>> Sweet.\nAll right.\n\n1146\n00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,260\nSo, there we go.\n\n1147\n00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,601\nI will take it down and remove this guy so\n\n1148\n00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:46,807\nthat [CROSSTALK]\n>> You notice that the virtual hard drive\n\n1149\n00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:48,700\nthere is listed as 20 gigabytes, right?\n\n1150\n00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,420\nBecause that's what we set that initial.\n\n1151\n00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,730\nWhen we created that virtual hard drive,\n\n1152\n00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:57,320\nwe went with a dynamically\nexpanding 20 gigabyte hard drive.\n\n1153\n00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,400\nSo, it shows 20 gigabytes there.\n\n1154\n00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,163\nLet's take a look at the file\non your physical machine.\n\n1155\n00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:07,084\nIf we can remember where we hid it.\n\n1156\n00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:14,342\n>> Yep, so this one, for\na lab that we did earlier,\n\n1157\n00:57:14,342 --> 00:57:17,320\nI did create two virtual hard drives.\n\n1158\n00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,100\n>> Nice.\n>> And put the two in there.\n\n1159\n00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:23,700\nAnd this one's using the A,\nthe A version, right?\n\n1160\n00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,540\n>> Yep.\n>> So right now it's at just\n\n1161\n00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,570\nabout 11 gigabytes in size.\n\n1162\n00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,520\n>> 11 gigabytes.\n\n1163\n00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,800\nSo even though the virtual machine\nshows 20 gigabytes of hard drive space.\n\n1164\n00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:38,350\nWhen look at the VHDX file it's only 10\ngigs because it's dynamically expanding so\n\n1165\n00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,490\nit will grow as we add more data to it.\n\n1166\n00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:42,730\nBeautiful.\n\n1167\n00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,360\n>> Cool stuff.\n\n1168\n00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,000\n>> It is.\n\n1169\n00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,510\n>> It's fantastic stuff.\n\n1170\n00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:46,585\nHow can you not really get into this?\n\n1171\n00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:53,570\n[LAUGH] So one thing down there, let me\nmove this guy out of the way a little bit.\n\n1172\n00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:58,300\nSo on the, come on, slide that down.\n\n1173\n00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,750\n>> I do hate having to scroll to\nget to the top and the bottom.\n\n1174\n00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,690\n>> Yeah, goodness sake.\n\n1175\n00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,080\nSo down there on the bottom,\nwe do not have anything plugged into our\n\n1176\n00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:13,860\nvirtual adapter there, so\nyour little internet adapter.\n\n1177\n00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,390\n>> Yeah, just like it'd be if we built,\nI know we keep saying that, just like,\n\n1178\n00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:20,310\nwe need our little recording here,\nbut think about building\n\n1179\n00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:23,445\na machine at your house, or\nbuilding a machine up at your work.\n\n1180\n00:58:23,445 --> 00:58:27,495\nWe've built the machine,\nwe've installed our operating system, but\n\n1181\n00:58:27,495 --> 00:58:30,525\nthat machine's not gonna do much\nuntil we connect it to a network.\n\n1182\n00:58:30,525 --> 00:58:33,725\nSo that'd be our next challenge\nthen is to network this guy.\n\n1183\n00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:35,135\nLet him talk to other machines, and\n\n1184\n00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,359\nall the

Mm-hm.\n\n1187\n00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,330\n>> We're gonna do.\n\n1188\n00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:46,860\nAnd that is to create a virtual network.\n\n1189\n00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,610\n>> Yes.\n\n1190\n00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,010\n>> Right.\n>> Virtual switch.\n\n1191\n00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:50,014\n>> Virtual switch.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n1192\n00:58:50,014 --> 00:58:51,179\n>>

myself.\n\n1195\n00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:02,050\nPrior to 2012 and Windows 8,\nit was called a virtual network manager,\n\n1196\n00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:06,900\nwith 2012 and 8,\nthey've switched the name to a virtual.\n\n1197\n00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,160\nSwitch the name?\n\n1198\n00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,290\nNo pun intended, there.\n\n1199\n00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:13,307\n[LAUGH] They have changed, and they have\nmodified the name to a virtual switch\n\n1200\n00:59:13,307 --> 00:59:16,780\nmanager, because the logically,\nit makes a little more sense.\n\n1201\n00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,750\nIt is more like a switch.\n\n1202\n00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,570\n>> Right, so here we go.\n\n1203\n00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:24,910\n>> First thing we've got to do is create\na virtual

that.\n\n1206\n00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,210\nWe've got three choices there.\n\n1207\n00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,740\nI got external, internal, and private.\n\n1208\n00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,490\n>> Yep.\n\n1209\n00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:35,930\nNow.\n\n1210\n00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:36,750\n>> After you.\n\n1211\n00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:37,960\n>> All right so.\n\n1212\n00:59:37,960 -->

on?\n\n1215\n00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,250\nWhy don't you explain?\n\n1216\n00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:44,998\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH] No wait, now.\n\n1217\n00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:45,892\n>> Go

Yeah.\n\n1221\n00:59:48,154 --> 00:59:50,860\n[LAUGH]\n>> He's like I'm not switching back.\n\n1222\n00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,750\nI guess Mike you're explaining it.\n\n1223\n00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,528\n>> All right, so.\n\n1224\n00:59:54,528 --> 00:59:57,170\n[LAUGH]\n>> We can do it again.\n\n1225\n00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,770\n>> We can do it together.\n\n1226\n00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,120\nSo, one, two, three.\n\n1227\n01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:00,930\nSo an external\n>> All right.\n\n1228\n01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,600\nOkay.\n>> [LAUGH] No, I'll go.\n\n1229\n01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,650\nI'll go ahead and explain.\n\n1230\n01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:04,770\n>> After you.\n\n1231\n01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:05,570\n>> All right.\n\n1232\n01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:09,460\nSo an external switch,\n\n1233\n01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:14,390\nwhat this will do is let\nthe virtual machine talk to\n\n1234\n01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:19,659\nthe physical adapter that we have,\nand let it get internet access.\n\n1235\n01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,590\nYeah, out the real adapter.\n\n1236\n01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:26,050\n>> Yeah, so external is really like.\n\n1237\n01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,620\nIt's gonna give you access to.\n\n1238\n01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,710\nYou've got three choices.\n\n1239\n01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,300\nYou've got private, you've got internal,\nyou've got external.\n\n1240\n01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,740\nExternal is gonna be just like\na real world physical adapter.\n\n1241\n01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:39,250\nYou're gonna have access to the other\nvirtual machines that are running on that\n\n1242\n01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,400\nvirtual server.\n\n1243\n01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,880\nYou're gonna have access to\nthe managing operating system or\n\n1244\n01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,390\nthe host operating system, and you're\ngonna have access to the physical network,\n\n1245\n01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:49,830\nwhatever network that the host\nmachine is connected to.\n\n1246\n01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:55,040\nSo if that host machine has internet\naccess, and you create an external switch,\n\n1247\n01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,650\nand connect your virtual machine\nto that external switch,\n\n1248\n01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,500\nthen your virtual machine would\nalso have internet access.\n\n1249\n01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,490\nSo its not that the external network\nadapter gives the virtual machine\n\n1250\n01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:08,460\ninternet access,\nits that external network adapter\n\n1251\n01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:13,100\ngives it access to the physical network\nthat the host machine is connected to.\n\n1252\n01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,810\n>> Yeah\n>> Does that make sense?\n\n1253\n01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,642\n>> Yeah,\nthat is a good way of putting that.\n\n1254\n01:01:16,642 --> 01:01:23,045\nAll right, so I went ahead and\nclicked create on an external switch.\n\n1255\n01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:24,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1256\n01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:28,190\n>> Up at the top, so\nwe can choose the name of our switch.\n\n1257\n01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:28,691\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1258\n01:01:28,691 --> 01:01:33,210\n>> I'd probably call it\nsomething like VM External.\n\n1259\n01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,871\nEasy to identify for the VM's.\n\n1260\n01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:35,409\nMm-hm.\n\n1261\n01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:36,730\nYep.\n>> And right down here.\n\n1262\n01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:41,220\nSo again we have the choice\nof what to create.\n\n1263\n01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,680\nSo on the external network, right.\n\n1264\n01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,050\n>> That is a good point\nthat it brings up there.\n\n1265\n01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,215\nNo matter what you choose\non the first screen.\n\n1266\n01:01:48,215 --> 01:01:50,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you select external.\n\n1267\n01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:52,590\n>> Internal, private.\n\n1268\n01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,390\nWhen you get to the next\nscreen of the wizard,\n\n1269\n01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:57,670\nyou've got the three radio buttons there\nand you can choose whichever one you want.\n\n1270\n01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,280\nSo it doesn't really matter\nwhat you have selected\n\n1271\n01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,048\non that first screen of the wizard.\n\n1272\n01:02:02,048 --> 01:02:02,606\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1273\n01:02:02,606 --> 01:02:04,250\n>> Interesting side note.\n\n1274\n01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,250\n>> And so right there under\nthe external network it lists\n\n1275\n01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,450\n>> The adapter, right?\n\n1276\n01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:15,590\nSo the nick that I'm currently using,\nit's a A6 USB 3.0 adapter and\n\n1277\n01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,420\nit lists that there so I can choose it.\n\n1278\n01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,090\nIf I had multiple adapters.\n\n1279\n01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:21,110\n>> They would all show up in there.\n\n1280\n01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:25,020\nYou might have a host machine that\nhas three network adapters in there.\n\n1281\n01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,270\nEach one of those network adapters\nis connected to a different\n\n1282\n01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:31,820\nportion of your network, different\nland segments or something like that.\n\n1283\n01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,780\nYou can choose which network\nadapter you're giving,\n\n1284\n01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:39,680\nwhich network adapter this\nswitch is getting access to.\n\n1285\n01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,470\n>> Yup.\n\n1286\n01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,415\nSo, clicking on that box we can see some.\n\n1287\n01:02:43,415 --> 01:02:46,057\n>> Treenote advanced, and so\nthere's the wireless adapter.\n\n1288\n01:02:46,057 --> 01:02:50,860\nSo you could have this virtual\nmachine tied to the A6 3\n\n1289\n01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:54,790\npoint USB adapter, or\nour wireless adapter.\n\n1290\n01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:55,520\n>> Yeah, that's new too.\n\n1291\n01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,210\nThey've added that support for\nwireless network.\n\n1292\n01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,580\nNetwork adapters with 2008, 2012.\n\n1293\n01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,250\nSo, very nice feature.\n\n1294\n01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,200\n>> Nice.\n\n1295\n01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,280\nAnd down there at the bottom right.\n\n1296\n01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:10,080\nSo VLAN ID tagging, so enterprise\nkind of stuff, if we have different\n\n1297\n01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,620\nVLANs setup and then we can have these\nvirtual machines, integrate into that and\n\n1298\n01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:19,100\nthat will be a little out of the scope\nof what we'll be covering on.\n\n1299\n01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,760\nBut in the server stuff, they'll be.\n\n1300\n01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,400\n>> And they also have a little check mark\nthere for allow management operating\n\n1301\n01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,250\nsystem to share this network adapter,\nusually a good idea, especially\n\n1302\n01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,500\ninitially when you're setting it up\n>> But\n\n1303\n01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:35,020\nyou could choose to where this\nnetwork adapter, the physical host,\n\n1304\n01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,670\ndoesn't even have access to\nthe network adapter anymore.\n\n1305\n01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:40,280\nYou would hope you had a second\nnetwork adapter in that machine so\n\n1306\n01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,010\nthe physical host could still\ngain access to the network.\n\n1307\n01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:47,325\nYou can remove access from\nthe host operating system.\n\n1308\n01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:50,042\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd I'm glad you brought that point up.\n\n1309\n01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:54,949\nSo at home, so I run all the hyper\nv at the house, I've got it And\n\n1310\n01:03:54,949 --> 01:04:00,790\nthe menagerie of different systems I\nused to play with and do things with.\n\n1311\n01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:08,120\nIn my desktop at home, I bought a handful\nof PC Express Network Adapters.\n\n1312\n01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:13,510\nAnd I put those in my computer and\non the different virtual machines,\n\n1313\n01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:18,740\nI tied them external and\nI unchecked the allow management.\n\n1314\n01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:24,410\nAnd so the host computer can't\nuse the network adapter at all,\n\n1315\n01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:28,590\nand so those virtual machines have\nexclusive use to that adapter, and\n\n1316\n01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,750\nif I have all my machines pulled up and\n\n1317\n01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,950\nall doing things it's not going to be\ntrying to shove it all out one port.\n\n1318\n01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:39,960\nThey all have their own adapter and\ntheir own connection to the network.\n\n1319\n01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,660\n>> In a corporate environment a lot\nof times what we'll end up doing,\n\n1320\n01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,320\nis having a separate network for\nthe management of the virtual machines.\n\n1321\n01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,290\nSo that your normal bandwidth for\nyour end users accessing the resources\n\n1322\n01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:54,590\non those virtuals,\ngoes through one network adapter.\n\n1323\n01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,080\nYour management comes through\nthe other network adapter so\n\n1324\n01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,130\nthat the bandwidth that\nthe users are generating doesn't\n\n1325\n01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,505\naffect your ability to get in there and\nmanage those working machines.\n\n1326\n01:05:02,505 --> 01:05:03,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1327\n01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:04,760\n>> So.\n\n1328\n01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,655\n>> And the

01:05:25,690\nBut yeah, really it's creating again,\nconceptually you want to think of them\n\n1337\n01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,860\nas switches, I mean they're just like\nyou'd go buy a 20 port switch or\n\n1338\n01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,530\nsomething, so you're creating a.\n\n1339\n01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,280\n>> 20 switch?\n\n1340\n01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:31,870\n>> 24

01:05:46,980\n[LAUGH] So that internal network adapter,\nas Nate was saying, is going to give\n\n1346\n01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:53,330\naccess to, if I connect a virtual machine\nto an internal network, that I've created.\n\n1347\n01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,610\nIt can connect to, it can talk to other\nvirtual machines that are connected\n\n1348\n01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,420\nto that same internal switch,\n\n1349\n01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:04,475\nas well as the host operating system can\nalso connect to the internal switch.\n\n1350\n01:06:04,475 --> 01:06:05,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1351\n01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:11,890\nAnd choosing internal network, it does\nnot give or it does not allow the virtual\n\n1352\n01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:17,770\nmachine to speak outside this little\nnetwork between it and the host.\n\n1353\n01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:20,880\nSo no internet access, no LAN access.\n\n1354\n01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,540\n>> Yeah, it keeps it from connecting\nto the physical network adapter.\n\n1355\n01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:27,475\nSo it's all internal on the machine\nthat's hosting the virtuals.\n\n1356\n01:06:27,475 --> 01:06:31,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And the last choice\n\n1357\n01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:35,840\nwe have here is a private network and what\nthis will do is create a virtual switch.\n\n1358\n01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:40,240\nThat allows just the virtual\nmachines to talk to one another.\n\n1359\n01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,320\nThey can't talk to the host, they can't\ntalk outside of this little network,\n\n1360\n01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,500\nthey can't talk to the internet,\nnothing, just them and those guys.\n\n1361\n01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,970\n>> I use these a lot for\nmy test I was talking about.\n\n1362\n01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:54,720\nLate at night when you start playing with\nthe tools that are maybe controversial or\n\n1363\n01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,160\nwhatever you know.\n\n1364\n01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,610\nYou create this private network that,\nthat way, anything I release in there,\n\n1365\n01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:06,520\nI feel relatively safe that's it's not\ngoing to affect my host machine, and\n\n1366\n01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:11,490\nend up giving myself and my network\na virus or anything like that, so.\n\n1367\n01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:16,020\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, good point, and private\nnetworks, so this would be the ideal-\n\n1368\n01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,120\n>> R and D, if you're doing research and\n\n1369\n01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,190\ndevelopment, you want to make sure that\nwhat you're doing is not effecting your\n\n1370\n01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:21,310\nproduction network.\n\n1371\n01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:26,330\nYou might have taken backups of your\nphysical servers and then restored them\n\n1372\n01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:31,370\ninto a virtual machine to do some tests,\nand mimicking your production environment.\n\n1373\n01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:34,130\nAnd I can't have name conflicts and\nthings like that, so\n\n1374\n01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:36,200\nI wanna make sure that these\nguys are separate, and\n\n1375\n01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,180\nthere's no change that they can\naffect my production environment.\n\n1376\n01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,330\n>> Yeah, good point.\n\n1377\n01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:45,340\nSo for our purposes here,\nwe're gonna create a private network.\n\n1378\n01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,560\nSo we'll just click apply.\n\n1379\n01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,520\n>> Yeah, one thing to keep in\nmind as he's creating that.\n\n1380\n01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,090\nWhen you go and create that,\nif you did create an external network,\n\n1381\n01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:57,980\nit's going to have to reset your\nnetwork adapter because it's going\n\n1382\n01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,900\nto create this virtual network adapter,\ngive it access to the physical.\n\n1383\n01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,530\nSo you will loose network\nconnectivity temporarily.\n\n1384\n01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:08,960\nWhich in our case, with the live\nstreaming, might not be such a good thing.\n\n1385\n01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,356\nWe'll stick with private for this one.\n\n1386\n01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,920\n>> Good point, good point.\n\n1387\n01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,600\nAlright, so now that we have\nthe little virtual switch created,\n\n1388\n01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:24,070\nwe can go into the settings for\nthis machine that's currently running.\n\n1389\n01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:29,150\nAnd down here under network adaptor\nsetting, we can select this.\n\n1390\n01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:32,630\nAnd over in this menu here, right?\n\n1391\n01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:36,640\nNow, other settings here,\nand some of these-\n\n1392\n01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,400\n>> In the server class,\n\n1393\n01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,150\nwe'll probably worry more about some\nof the advanced settings we can do with\n\n1394\n01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,990\nthe bandwidth allocation and\nthings like that, and limitations.\n\n1395\n01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:50,370\nBut really what we're doing here,\nif you're new to virtualization\n\n1396\n01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:55,160\nit really helps to think about what you\nwould do in a physical environment and\n\n1397\n01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,740\nthen, it's the same\nthing it's just virtual.\n\n1398\n01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,800\nSo in a physical environment,\nI built a machine.\n\n1399\n01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,830\nI put in my hard drive,\nI installed my operating system.\n\n1400\n01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:06,980\nThen I went and I broke out my switch, and\n\n1401\n01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:10,790\nI set it next to the computer and\nI plugged my switch into the wall.\n\n1402\n01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:13,610\nNow, all we're doing is\ntaking a patch cable and\n\n1403\n01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:16,150\nrunning it from\nthe computer to the switch.\n\n1404\n01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:20,580\nWe're connecting our virtual machine\nto that switch that we just created.\n\n1405\n01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,280\nAnd we could have many different\nswitches over there and\n\n1406\n01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,620\nthey'd show up in that drop down list and\nwe'd pick the one we want to connect to.\n\n1407\n01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,880\nSo it's really just like patching down\nyour machine, is what you're doing.\n\n1408\n01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,090\n>> All right, yeah, thanks Mike.\n\n1409\n01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:38,126\nAll right so we did chose it for\nthe one We come over into here and.\n\n1410\n01:09:38,126 --> 01:09:41,920\n>> It might not have refreshed there yet.\n\n1411\n01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,430\nDid you apply those settings?\n\n1412\n01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:44,450\n>> Yes.\n>> It did not, okay.\n\n1413\n01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,750\nGood.\n>> All right.\n\n1414\n01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:50,880\nYeah, I maximized it, but\nit did not move it out of the way.\n\n1415\n01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,460\nI mean, come down.\n\n1416\n01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,550\nSo, yeah, it.\n\n1417\n01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,825\nSo now,\ninstead of a little exclamation point.\n\n1418\n01:09:55,825 --> 01:09:56,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1419\n01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:01,910\n>> So it is connected right, so\nit is attached to something but\n\n1420\n01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,880\nit doesn't have internet access and\nso it get a little triangle.\n\n1421\n01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,740\n>> If we hover over we have\nlimited access to this point\n\n1422\n01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:14,326\nbecause just like can we\njust say that one more time?\n\n1423\n01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:17,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know what we're gonna do now is\n\n1424\n01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,500\nwe're gonna watch the show again.\n\n1425\n01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,282\nWait.\nCan we talk about drinking on here?\n\n1426\n01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,970\n[LAUGH] 'Cause that would make\na great drinking show, right.\n\n1427\n01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:27,800\nEvery time they say Just like,\nyou wouldn't get any studying done,\n\n1428\n01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,950\nbut it would be one heck of a night.\n\n1429\n01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:34,025\nAnyway, not that we're promoting drinking.\n\n1430\n01:10:34,025 --> 01:10:36,990\n[LAUGH]\nWhen I say drink,\n\n1431\n01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,485\nI meant Mountain Dew, of course.\n\n1432\n01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:41,190\n>> [LAUGH] Just like.\n\n1433\n01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:43,340\n>> So just like.\n\n1434\n01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:46,550\n>> So we've hashtagged that down,\n\n1435\n01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:50,990\nbut we haven't given it any\nTCP IP configuration information.\n\n1436\n01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:54,160\nSo as in the real world, how's that,\nwe'll change it up a little bit.\n\n1437\n01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,150\nHow's that?\nWe'll change it up a little bit.\n\n1438\n01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,140\n>> As in the real world.\n\n1439\n01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:58,780\n>> As in the real world, you take\na machine, you plug it up to a network,\n\n1440\n01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:03,550\nif there's no DHCP server available\nto provide the TCP IP configuration\n\n1441\n01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:07,550\nto the virtual machine,\nthen it's gonna get an address, so\n\n1442\n01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:10,240\nthat's what we expect to\nsee here is an address.\n\n1443\n01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:14,960\n>> All right, so\nthis is our virtual machine, right?\n\n1444\n01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,810\nAnd yeah.\n\n1445\n01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:20,530\nSure enough, we can pull up\na command prompt, and IP config and,\n\n1446\n01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:21,810\nokay, that's right.\n\n1447\n01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:26,160\nFor a previous lab, I've already set some-\n>> You've set me up for failure there,\n\n1448\n01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:26,995\ndidn't you?\n\n1449\n01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,950\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so I've already set up-\n\n1450\n01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:30,940\n>> For the magic of TV,\n\n1451\n01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:34,320\nNate has already statically mapped\nthe IP address on his virtual machine.\n\n1452\n01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,933\n>> Yeah, we'll have to check\nout the second one though.\n\n1453\n01:11:36,933 --> 01:11:37,931\nI'm not sure about the second one.\n\n1454\n01:11:37,931 --> 01:11:39,098\n>> Ok, good deal.\n\n1455\n01:11:39,098 --> 01:11:41,830\n>> Alright, so there we go.\n\n1456\n01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:45,417\nSo let's jump over to our second machine.\n\n1457\n01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:49,501\nWe'll go into its settings,\ninto its network adapter.\n\n1458\n01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:52,000\nAnd we'll also attach\nit to the same switch.\n\n1459\n01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1460\n01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,500\n>> Oops.\n\n1461\n01:12:00,208 --> 01:12:00,890\nAll right.\n\n1462\n01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:04,300\nImportant to remember those settings\ndon't actually take effect until you\n\n1463\n01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,940\neither click Apply or\nOK to close that window.\n\n1464\n01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:08,730\nIt's easy to do.\n\n1465\n01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,200\nI have done it many times myself.\n\n1466\n01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,010\nMade a change.\n\n1467\n01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:14,030\nGo back over to the virtual machine.\n\n1468\n01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:14,610\n>> Why isn't it working?\n\n1469\n01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,448\nI left that property sheet open.\n\n1470\n01:12:18,073 --> 01:12:20,640\nYeah, you know, you can see it\nin the thumbnail down there.\n\n1471\n01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,020\nIt shows a little Windows\ngetting started up here and\n\n1472\n01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,610\nthat's one thing that I\nlike you know with Hyper V.\n\n1473\n01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:26,630\nThe little thumbnail?\n\n1474\n01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:27,550\nThe little thumbnail.\n\n1475\n01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:28,950\nMm hm.\nAnd as I was saying earlier,\n\n1476\n01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,960\nyou don't have to connect to the machines.\n\n1477\n01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,500\nThese are going to run in\nthe background when you start them up.\n\n1478\n01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,070\nYou could click on the different\nones to see which ones are running.\n\n1479\n01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:39,610\nYou get a little, eventually,\nonce we get all of the VM add ons,\n\n1480\n01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:42,640\nwe will actually see a little\nheart beat on there so\n\n1481\n01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,600\nwe would know that it was connected and\nthings like that.\n\n1482\n01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:51,224\nWe'll log into this guy with\nNathan's super secret password.\n\n1483\n01:12:51,224 --> 01:12:56,220\nThis is we need number two\nwho is now connected to\n\n1484\n01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:59,830\nthe same virtual switch that we've patched\nto both computers down to the same switch.\n\n1485\n01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:04,500\nWe'll check on the TCP/IP\nconfigure on this guy.\n\n1486\n01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:08,410\nWith a little IP config, and\n\n1487\n01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:14,190\nthere's what we expect to see when you\nplug in a machine that has no TCP/IP and\n\n1488\n01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:18,900\nno DH3 server available, so at this point,\nwould they be able to talk to each other?\n\n1489\n01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,450\nNot yet.\n\n1490\n01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:21,630\nThey're on separate networks, so\n\n1491\n01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:27,220\nwe won't quite get into the networking\nwill it make like a, network?\n\n1492\n01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:30,240\nWe've got a great network plus episode for\nyou guys to watch.\n\n1493\n01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:35,650\nReal quick though, but yeah let,\nyou know let's back at these guys\n\n1494\n01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:39,770\nyou know what we're getting close to\nthe break here, should we set it up?\n\n1495\n01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:44,320\nReal quick or Depends on how fast\nyou can do your NSH command.\n\n1496\n01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,370\nNSH Oh, you're gonna get on the GUI and\ndo it I get ya.\n\n1497\n01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:51,390\n[LAUGH] Hey Mike, why don't you\nwalk me through those commands.\n\n1498\n01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:56,050\nSo after break we're gonna\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Right?\n\n1499\n01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:56,590\nWell that's good.\n\n1500\n01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:57,500\nOh, I like it.\n\n1501\n01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,080\nAll right.\n\n1502\n01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,650\nAll right, well, yeah yeah yeah.\n\n1503\n01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:00,740\nSo let's do that.\n\n1504\n01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,370\nSo we'll take our break.\n\n1505\n01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:04,130\nRight?\nI'll get the.\n\n1506\n01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:05,730\nI'll change,\nthey're all on the same network.\n\n1507\n01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:07,890\nNetwork settings will\nstatically map those guys.\n\n1508\n01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:12,100\nWe'll show that the virtual\nmachines can talk to each other.\n\n1509\n01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,900\nAnd the last thing to wrap up.\n\n1510\n01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,220\nSnapshots and managing virtual machines.\n\n1511\n01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:22,840\nSo, once you got em up and you need\nto move em from test into production.\n\n1512\n01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,430\nRight?\nCover that.\n\n1513\n01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:25,760\nSounds like a plan.\n\n1514\n01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,410\nAll right.\n\n1515\n01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:29,734\nSee you in a few minutes.\n\n1516\n01:14:29,734 --> 01:14:35,152\n[SOUND] And welcome back friend for\n\n1517\n01:14:35,152 --> 01:14:41,740\nthe last segment of our hyper v bonanza.\n\n1518\n01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,760\nWoohoo.\n\n1519\n01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,656\nWe've got virtual machines fired up\nwe've got the virtual switch configured.\n\n1520\n01:14:47,656 --> 01:14:48,430\nWe did.\n\n1521\n01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:52,990\nWe got both machines statically\nmapped since we don't have DHCP and\n\n1522\n01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,970\nall that other fun stuff.\n\n1523\n01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:58,320\n>> So at this point they should be\nable to talk to each other right?\n\n1524\n01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,500\n>> Yeah.\nTalking to each other\n\n1525\n01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,410\njust like a real network switch right?\n\n1526\n01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:07,010\nExactly.\nConnected together.\n\n1527\n01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:07,630\nExactly.\n\n1528\n01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:08,350\nAlright, so yeah.\n\n1529\n01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,270\nLet's check it.\n\n1530\n01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,060\nYeah.\nLet's fire them up.\n\n1531\n01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,440\nCheck key check.\n\n1532\n01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,520\nBack in here,\nwe've got the machines down here.\n\n1533\n01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,560\nGot one eight number one, all right?\n\n1534\n01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,330\nAnd we can browse into his folder,\nand his network settings.\n\n1535\n01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,890\nAnd once it refreshes a little bit.\n\n1536\n01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:25,600\nSo, there we go.\n\n1537\n01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,468\nSo, we've got one eight number one\nright in himself, One-Eight-Dash-Two.\n\n1538\n01:15:29,468 --> 01:15:33,750\nWe've got this other guy, DC01,\nI had to bring himself for\n\n1539\n01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:38,340\nsomething else\n>> Cool, good enough.\n\n1540\n01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:42,300\n>> SO\nnow we'll jump over to One-Eight-Dash-Two,\n\n1541\n01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,210\nthat's this guy right here.\n\n1542\n01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,370\nAnd open up his settings on his network.\n\n1543\n01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,395\nAnd sure enough-\nPlayer One-Eight Number One.\n\n1544\n01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:53,060\n>> One-Eight Number One It's\na beautiful thing.\n\n1545\n01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:53,920\nIt sure is.\n\n1546\n01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,690\nlet theme so let's write a file.\n\n1547\n01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,253\nOkay.\nSo in One-Eight-Dash-Two right,\n\n1548\n01:16:00,253 --> 01:16:02,520\nhe's got the um,let in his.\n\n1549\n01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,260\nThis document, we've got a folder here,\ngame save files.\n\n1550\n01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:09,900\nNice!\nIf there's one thing you want backed up,\n\n1551\n01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,994\nis your game save files.\n\n1552\n01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:19,440\nhmm, so we're going to create a new\ndocument, how about Game Codes.\n\n1553\n01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,320\nVery good.\n\n1554\n01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,710\nYou mean cheat codes.\n\n1555\n01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,823\nAnd in Game Codes write[CROOSTALK\nNow we know how he wins.\n\n1556\n01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:32,023\n>> You know what,\n[NOISE] we won't actually

01:16:49,260\nLet's jump over to one-eight number one.\n\n1563\n01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:53,990\nAnd we'll browse to our one eight\nnumber two in the Game Saved share.\n\n1564\n01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:56,960\nSure enough, there's our game codes,\nand there it's at.\n\n1565\n01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,470\nNice.\n\n1566\n01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:00,750\nAll right, so everyone's communicating,\nthey're talking to each other,\n\n1567\n01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:06,680\nwe have reached, what's that called when\neverything gets aligned and they're all?\n\n1568\n01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,680\nHarmony?\n\n1569\n01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,540\nConvergence.\n\n1570\n01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,160\nConvergence.\n\n1571\n01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:12,820\nWe have reached If Ronnie was here,\nhe'd know.\n\n1572\n01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:13,830\nYes.\nYep.\n\n1573\n01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,500\nRonnie, I know you're out there watching.\n\n1574\n01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,040\nWhy don't you hurry and send me a message\nand let me know if it's convergence.\n\n1575\n01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,150\nHope he's watching.\n\n1576\n01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:22,980\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n1577\n01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,520\n>> Beautiful.\n>> We have our machines,\n\n1578\n01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,820\nour virtual switch set up and so now,\n\n1579\n01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:32,110\nour test environment is ready to\n>> Be pushed out into production.\n\n1580\n01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:37,110\nBut before we do that,\nlet's create a snapshot of where we are.\n\n1581\n01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:43,107\nNow, a snapshot,is not it\nshouldn't be considered a backup,\n\n1582\n01:17:43,107 --> 01:17:47,290\nbut it's like a snapshot of its settings.\n\n1583\n01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:49,590\n>> I like it when you use\nthe word to define the word.\n\n1584\n01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:50,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I really do like that.\n\n1585\n01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:51,950\nBut it is what it is.\n\n1586\n01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:54,870\nIs what it is what it is.\n\n1587\n01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:59,750\nSnapshot is a point in time\nimage of that virtual machine.\n\n1588\n01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:03,820\nOne thing we want to make sure we\nunderstand is one, it's not a replacement\n\n1589\n01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:09,350\nfor back ups, you still need to back\nup your virtual machines, just like\n\n1590\n01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:12,740\none more time just like in the real\nworld [LAUGH] we do have to much sure we\n\n1591\n01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:17,120\nare backing these machines up, but backing\nup a virtual machine is a lot easier than\n\n1592\n01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,790\nbacking up a physical machine but again,\nwe will save that for another episode.\n\n1593\n01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:23,880\nHere what we are going to do is we\nare going to create a snapshot,\n\n1594\n01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,570\na snapshot is a point in time\nimage of that machine and\n\n1595\n01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:29,790\nthey're extremely handy\n>> When you're testing things out.\n\n1596\n01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:34,100\nBecause I'm getting ready to make a change\nto this virtual machine, it might work,\n\n1597\n01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,380\nit might not work, right?\n\n1598\n01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:36,700\nThat's why I have these virtual's, so\n\n1599\n01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,720\nI can test these things outside\nof a production environment.\n\n1600\n01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,050\nIf it doesn't work, I hose this\nmachine and I gotta start all over,\n\n1601\n01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,330\nbuild a new machine, anything like that.\n\n1602\n01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:48,610\nNo, we create a snapshot\nright before we do it.\n\n1603\n01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:52,710\nAnd then if something bad happens,\nI can roll back to that point\n\n1604\n01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:55,840\nin time like it never happened and\nI can do a different test.\n\n1605\n01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,140\nTry to do it a little differently and\nsee if that does not.\n\n1606\n01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:01,750\nStop me from hosing my machine [LAUGH].\n\n1607\n01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,770\nSo yeah, snapshots are fantastic.\n\n1608\n01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:06,630\nAnother one of those things that\nyou're really not gonna see being\n\n1609\n01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:08,740\nused in a production environment.\n\n1610\n01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:11,310\nBecause of the way it\nworks in the background,\n\n1611\n01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:14,090\nit ends up creating\na differentiating disk.\n\n1612\n01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:18,720\nSo that point in time we create\na differentiating disk, and\n\n1613\n01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,830\nany changes we make to\nthe virtual machine,\n\n1614\n01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:24,900\nsince that point in time, are being\nstored in that differentiating disk.\n\n1615\n01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,980\nAnd then if we decide\nto keep those changes,\n\n1616\n01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:30,610\nwe can merge that differentiating\ndisk back with the original VHD.\n\n1617\n01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:35,080\nOr if we decide to roll back, we just\nthrow away the differentiating disk, and\n\n1618\n01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,920\nwe're right back to that point before\nwe've made that differentiating disk.\n\n1619\n01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,850\nBut it is gonna affect your performance.\n\n1620\n01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:44,374\nSo, it's something we use to test and\nthen if things go well,\n\n1621\n01:19:44,374 --> 01:19:47,167\nwe'll typically merge that back in.\n\n1622\n01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:49,791\nBut again,\nnot in a production environment, more for\n\n1623\n01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:51,167\nyour testing environment.\n\n1624\n01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:56,063\n>> Now Mike, [COUGH] now there is\none thing that you would actually\n\n1625\n01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:59,002\nuse it in a production environment.\n\n1626\n01:19:59,002 --> 01:19:59,800\nMm-hm.\nMm-hm.\n\n1627\n01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,460\nWhich would be?\n\n1628\n01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:01,460\nSnapshots.\n\n1629\n01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:02,220\nWould you?\nMm-hm.\n\n1630\n01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,590\nWhat would you do?\n\n1631\n01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,308\n>> It's App V, right?\n\n1632\n01:20:05,308 --> 01:20:10,755\nSo App V, we won't get into and go back\nand do it but sequencing an app, right?\n\n1633\n01:20:10,755 --> 01:20:15,235\n>> So to sequence an app you install it,\nApp V records all the changes made to\n\n1634\n01:20:15,235 --> 01:20:21,035\nthe hard drive and makes this little\npackage you can later push out.\n\n1635\n01:20:21,035 --> 01:20:24,285\nAnd it, yeah, you are to create\na snapshots of your drive so\n\n1636\n01:20:24,285 --> 01:20:26,170\nthat after you sequence that out,\n\n1637\n01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:29,950\nyou revert to that previous snapshot and\nrolls back all the changes.\n\n1638\n01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:34,300\nAnd then you can sequence to your next\napp, you can just roll everything back.\n\n1639\n01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,600\nAnd you do that in production.\n\n1640\n01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,080\nWell, actually, maybe not.\n\n1641\n01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,270\nYeah, I was going to say.\n\n1642\n01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,330\nIt depends on what you're doing.\n\n1643\n01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:42,860\nMe, personally, I probably wouldn't be in\nthe production environment doing that but\n\n1644\n01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,020\nit definitely could.\n\n1645\n01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,390\nAnd it's still a temporary use.\n\n1646\n01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:47,400\nRight.\nYou're not leaving that snapshot there.\n\n1647\n01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,770\nYou're creating that snapshot so you're\nseeing what happened to the machine when\n\n1648\n01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:53,900\nyou installed the app and\nthen getting rid of the snapshot and\n\n1649\n01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:56,760\ngoing back to the original machine so\nthat you can do it again in the future.\n\n1650\n01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,400\nSo they're fantastic,\nthey really do a good job.\n\n1651\n01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:06,550\nA real world example, just today we\nwere updating some of our Hyper V tools.\n\n1652\n01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:13,500\nI had to do it to a server and we found\nthat there was an issue with these guys.\n\n1653\n01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,950\nAnd so\nknowing that it might cause a problem,\n\n1654\n01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:18,410\nthat I might end up loose\nscreening one of my machines.\n\n1655\n01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:23,460\nBefore I installed those editions\nI took a snapshot of it and\n\n1656\n01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:24,848\nin fact it did blue screen.\n\n1657\n01:21:24,848 --> 01:21:29,058\n[LAUGH] I was able to go back to\nthe snapshot and everything was fine.\n\n1658\n01:21:29,058 --> 01:21:31,735\nNice so yeah they are definitely useful,\n\n1659\n01:21:31,735 --> 01:21:36,011\ndefinitely useful nice they\nwill effect your performance.\n\n1660\n01:21:36,011 --> 01:21:40,570\nAnd on your App V sequencer, you're not\nworried about performance in that case,\n\n1661\n01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:43,710\nbecause people aren't hitting that\nmachine trying to access resources.\n\n1662\n01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:46,030\n>> Right on, thanks Mike.\n\n1663\n01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:49,220\nAll right, so yeah, let's take a snapshot.\n\n1664\n01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,370\nIt's a pretty straightforward\nprocess right?\n\n1665\n01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:57,220\nI mean, right click, snapshot And\nit says taking snapshot.\n\n1666\n01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:00,226\nAnd notice he did not shut the machine\ndown before he takes a snapshot.\n\n1667\n01:22:02,227 --> 01:22:03,680\nWe'll make a snapshot.\n\n1668\n01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,090\nThat was [COUGH] ] of this guy?hmm\n>> And you could, I mean,\n\n1669\n01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,210\ndepending on what you're trying to do,\nright?\n\n1670\n01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:14,740\nWhat that means is now that that point\nin time is frozen in the snapshot.\n\n1671\n01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:19,570\nSo if he does revert to that snap-shot,\nthe machine will be in a running state\n\n1672\n01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:23,270\nwith that window that we had\nopen will be sitting there.\n\n1673\n01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:25,680\nAnd everything is captured\nin that snap-shot.\n\n1674\n01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,340\nIf I shut the machine down and\ncreate a snap-shot,\n\n1675\n01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:33,630\nif I roll back to that snap-shot then\nthe machine would be in a shut down state.\n\n1676\n01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:36,420\nBut it is kind of neat that\nyou don't even have to\n\n1677\n01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,230\nshut the machine down to take a snapshot.\n\n1678\n01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:43,230\nLike when I was working on those servers\ntoday I did not power them down.\n\n1679\n01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:48,150\nI just took a quick snapshot, installed\nthe tools, blew the screen, Convert and\n\n1680\n01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:50,075\npretend it never happened.\n\n1681\n01:22:50,075 --> 01:22:54,150\n[LAUGH] And it all goes away\n>> That's right it's magic, it's magic and\n\n1682\n01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:57,274\nit doesn't take that long, in fact\nwere probably done already creating\n\n1683\n01:22:57,274 --> 01:22:58,830\nthat snapshot,yup right you know what.\n\n1684\n01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:00,840\nAll right let's test out our snapshot.\n\n1685\n01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:07,915\nSo back on, let's us one eight #1,\nso there's this guy alright let the,\n\n1686\n01:23:07,915 --> 01:23:12,880\nlet's change his Let's change\nthe background, right?\n\n1687\n01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,450\nChange that to- this one.\n\n1688\n01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,660\nThat is a beautiful background Mike.\n\n1689\n01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,300\nThat is some high contrast\nright there my friends.\n\n1690\n01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:23,840\nYou like that one?\n\n1691\n01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,829\nThat is pretty sweet.\n\n1692\n01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:28,010\nalright so there we go.\n\n1693\n01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:30,670\nThere is our awesome\nwicked cool background.\n\n1694\n01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:35,630\nSo what we will do is yeah and\nlets say we made some other configuration\n\n1695\n01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:38,340\nchanges to it, we are not real happy or\nplease with it.\n\n1696\n01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:41,510\nYeah I do not know who changed it to this\nhigh contrast but we got to get this back,\n\n1697\n01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:43,280\nwe got to get rid of this.\n\n1698\n01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,510\nObviously we could go\nchange the settings back.\n\n1699\n01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:50,390\nBut to show what our snapshot's\ngonna do let's revert that machine.\n\n1700\n01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:52,270\nYou can have a hierarchy of snapshots.\n\n1701\n01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:55,330\nIf you look before,\nyou can see down there underneath\n\n1702\n01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:59,610\nthe little list he's clicking on there\nyou see the different snapshots listed.\n\n1703\n01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:02,960\nYou got the time and\ndate that that snapshot was taken.\n\n1704\n01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,470\nWe can now select one of\nthose points in time.\n\n1705\n01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,935\nShould be able to apply that snapshot.\n\n1706\n01:24:12,226 --> 01:24:18,270\nAnd it'll ask you if you want to take\na snapshot now before you roll back.\n\n1707\n01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:22,620\nSo what if rolling back doesn't fix\nyour problem or makes it worse?\n\n1708\n01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:25,270\nI have a snapshot of right before\nI [LAUGH] applied the snapshot.\n\n1709\n01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:28,510\n[LAUGH] It gets a little [LAUGH] deep in\nthere, you can definitely twist it up.\n\n1710\n01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,980\nBut we won't bother with that.\n\n1711\n01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,260\nWe're just going to apply the snapshot.\n\n1712\n01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:39,690\nIt restores it and you can already tell\nfrom the thumbnail, there it goes.\n\n1713\n01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:42,810\nThat the file is still\nopen that he had open hmm,\n\n1714\n01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:48,010\nright there where he left it.yup, so\nbeautiful thing, It sure is Mike.\n\n1715\n01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:48,680\nThat's awesome.\n\n1716\n01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:53,950\nAnd our high contrast theme is gone\n[LAUGH] Yeah I think I may have changed.\n\n1717\n01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:56,850\nI could really use the high contrast.\n\n1718\n01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,080\nI saw the look in your eye,\n\n1719\n01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,370\nyou were like hm this is something\nI could see myself using.\n\n1720\n01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:01,870\nYeah.\n\n1721\n01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:04,190\nSo there's snapshots.\n\n1722\n01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:07,612\nNow one thing with snapshots is, so\n\n1723\n01:25:07,612 --> 01:25:12,185\nright now we're on the host\nour host computer.\n\n1724\n01:25:12,185 --> 01:25:15,476\nAnd let's browse, all right.\n\n1725\n01:25:15,476 --> 01:25:19,350\nBrowse right into our directory\nof where the hard drives are.\n\n1726\n01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:21,777\nYeah, it just happy to know.\n\n1727\n01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,640\nFM.\nSnapshots do take up space with you\n\n1728\n01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:32,340\nLike Mike said, you know, it is creating\nlike a differentiating disc right.\n\n1729\n01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:33,680\nIt is a differentiating disc basically.\n\n1730\n01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:37,950\nIt should be in AVHD if you look in there,\nyeah I can see them up there.\n\n1731\n01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:43,960\nIt should be an AVHDX which\nis there extension for\n\n1732\n01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,900\nit, but it is a differentiating drive.\n\n1733\n01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:50,435\nSo on this one on here right The size for\nit.\n\n1734\n01:25:50,435 --> 01:25:53,330\n913, That's quite huge.\n\n1735\n01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:54,620\nAnd that's almost a gig.\n\n1736\n01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,250\nThat's got to remember everything\nabout that machine all the registry,\n\n1737\n01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:03,100\nall the files, its basically almost\nlike an image of that machine so\n\n1738\n01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,950\nit came to be rather large,\n>> And you can see where if you had six,\n\n1739\n01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:10,840\nseven, eight different snapshots of\neach machine that you had on there\n\n1740\n01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,775\nyou could eat up some\ndisc space really quick.\n\n1741\n01:26:12,775 --> 01:26:13,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1742\n01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:15,800\n>> And that's just, again,\n\n1743\n01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,510\nback to the point where\n>> It's something that we typically\n\n1744\n01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:21,840\nuse temporarily to protect us\nwhen we're getting ready to\n\n1745\n01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,720\ntry a different configuration or install\nsome application that we're unsure of.\n\n1746\n01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,770\nBecause again, this is our test\nenvironment so create a snap shop,\n\n1747\n01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:33,120\ndo your test, test fails or test works.\n\n1748\n01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:33,940\nRoll it back and\n\n1749\n01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:36,950\nnow you're back to that pristine\nstate you can do a different test.\n\n1750\n01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:40,280\nWe don't keep them very long typically,\nbecause they do eat up a lot of space.\n\n1751\n01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,090\n>> Yeah, you know, if this was\na machine that we were using for\n\n1752\n01:26:43,090 --> 01:26:47,560\na long time, right, and\nwe're making snapshots of it,\n\n1753\n01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:53,300\nthese AV HDX files, I mean,\nwould grow with all the changes.\n\n1754\n01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,890\nYeah, you'd get\n>> Quite large?\n\n1755\n01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:56,710\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n1756\n01:26:56,710 --> 01:26:57,340\nVery quickly.\n\n1757\n01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:03,350\nAgain, another reason to put all of\nthis on a separate physical disk, so\n\n1758\n01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:07,890\nthat if you do start eating up all your\ndisk space, and you run out of disk space.\n\n1759\n01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:11,130\nYou don't crash the host machine itself,\nbecause it's out of space.\n\n1760\n01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:13,260\nOr we could set up disk quotas,\nright, with alerts?\n\n1761\n01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,150\nWe could.\nSo that we could be alerted to running\n\n1762\n01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:15,890\nout of disk space.\n\n1763\n01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:17,385\nThat sounds like a really good episode.\n\n1764\n01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:19,880\n[LAUGH] Disk quotas, yeah.\n\n1765\n01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,730\nYou taught me everything\nabout disk quotas.\n\n1766\n01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:22,470\nDid I?\n\n1767\n01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:23,900\nYeah, back in the day.\n\n1768\n01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,005\nNice.\nThat means he knows very little.\n\n1769\n01:27:26,005 --> 01:27:29,831\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Man.\n\n1770\n01:27:29,831 --> 01:27:33,460\nAlright- The student has\nsurpassed the teacher.\n\n1771\n01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:36,330\nThanks Mike, that's awesome.\n\n1772\n01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:38,910\nAlright getting back on track.\n\n1773\n01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:39,860\nOh yeah.\nSorry.\n\n1774\n01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,745\nThe okay Okay, so snapshots, right?\n\n1775\n01:27:41,745 --> 01:27:44,250\nSo our machines, they work,\nwe're on the network,\n\n1776\n01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,042\neverything is configured properly.\n\n1777\n01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:48,792\nWe have our snapshots created.\n\n1778\n01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:53,145\nSo now let's move it out of the test\nenvironment from this Laptop,\n\n1779\n01:27:53,145 --> 01:27:57,126\ncuz everything's running just\ninside this little laptop.\n\n1780\n01:27:57,126 --> 01:28:00,400\nAnd let's move that out to\na production environment.\n\n1781\n01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,930\nNow, just copy and paste?\n\n1782\n01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:04,940\n>> Not quite so easy, right?\n\n1783\n01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:06,270\n>> Grab the folder and move it over?\n\n1784\n01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:12,188\n>> Yeah, unfortunately with Hyper-V,\nwe cannot just copy those files out.\n\n1785\n01:28:12,188 --> 01:28:13,960\nThere's a process we have to go through.\n\n1786\n01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:17,150\nit's a very simple process but\nyou want to make sure that we\n\n1787\n01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:21,180\ndo this properly cuz I can't\njust copy those VHD files,\n\n1788\n01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:25,420\nVHDX files and those VMC files,\nor the configuration files.\n\n1789\n01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:27,797\nI can't just copy them\nup to my Hyper-V server,\n\n1790\n01:28:27,797 --> 01:28:31,722\nput them in the same folder as it's\nusing and expect them to show up.\n\n1791\n01:28:31,722 --> 01:28:35,230\nWe're gonna have to export them using\nthe wizard that's built into our tool.\n\n1792\n01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:38,170\nTake them over to our\nproduction Hyper-V server, and\n\n1793\n01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:40,660\nthen turn around and\nimport those machines.\n\n1794\n01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:43,920\nBut the fact that we can do that is\nreally one of the coolest things about\n\n1795\n01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,250\nclient side Hyper-V.\n\n1796\n01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:49,730\nBecause we're using the same technology\nthat we use up in our server environment,\n\n1797\n01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:52,000\nI don't have to worry about\ntrying to convert these.\n\n1798\n01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,450\nLike prior I couldn't take that\nvirtual PC that I had made, or\n\n1799\n01:28:56,450 --> 01:29:02,700\nthat virtual server that I made back in\n2003 and put it up on my Hyper-V server.\n\n1800\n01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:06,670\nThey were two different types\nof virtualization, and so\n\n1801\n01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:09,230\nwe had to convert them, if we could.\n\n1802\n01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:09,930\nWith this,\n\n1803\n01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:13,660\nyou can do all your testing and everything\nright there on your Windows 8 machine.\n\n1804\n01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:16,430\nGet it set up properly,\nget it ready to go.\n\n1805\n01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:19,750\nYou can export it out,\nhand it off to your production team.\n\n1806\n01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:24,390\nThey can import it into their Hyper-V\nserver and badabing, you're good to go.\n\n1807\n01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:24,960\n>> Sweet.\n\n1808\n01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,883\nNow to export these bad guys, right.\n\n1809\n01:29:27,883 --> 01:29:31,392\nSo we right-click on our machine\nto pull up this little menu,\n\n1810\n01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,900\nright and-\n>> No such luck.\n\n1811\n01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,940\n>> Nope.\nSo to export this guy, right?\n\n1812\n01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:37,840\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1813\n01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,510\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\n1814\n01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:40,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1815\n01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,677\n>> You're waiting for me to save you?\n\n1816\n01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:44,220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Let's see.\n\n1817\n01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,540\n>> You can find it.\n\n1818\n01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,386\n>> Let's highlight this guy and,\n\n1819\n01:29:54,586 --> 01:29:57,570\nAll right, Mike, throw me a bone.\n\n1820\n01:29:57,570 --> 01:30:00,763\n>> It has been a little while\nsince I have gone in here.\n\n1821\n01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:09,841\nYeah, that's actually.\n\n1822\n01:30:09,841 --> 01:30:11,943\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Should be the one.\n\n1823\n01:30:11,943 --> 01:30:14,688\nWhere did it go?\n\n1824\n01:30:14,688 --> 01:30:19,224\n>> As we were getting started, I was\ntelling Mike oh yeah, we can just copy and\n\n1825\n01:30:19,224 --> 01:30:20,600\npast the whole thing.\n\n1826\n01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:24,160\nAnd Mike's telling me, he's like no,\nyou can't just copy and paste.\n\n1827\n01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,490\nAnd I'm like, oh, I do it all the time.\n\n1828\n01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:29,933\nBut, it was on the same partition,\nthe same drive, and different folders.\n\n1829\n01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:34,739\nAnd so I said, all right Mike,\nwell then, heaven sakes.\n\n1830\n01:30:34,739 --> 01:30:37,073\n>> What's showing up down in\nyour Actions pane down there.\n\n1831\n01:30:40,745 --> 01:30:43,718\nHave any export options?\n\n1832\n01:30:43,718 --> 01:30:45,790\nThere are no export options.\n\n1833\n01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,350\nInteresting.\n\n1834\n01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:47,476\nGo ahead and shut that guy down then.\n\n1835\n01:30:59,909 --> 01:31:02,010\nOh, look at there.\n\n1836\n01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:03,658\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, you knew all along.\n\n1837\n01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,777\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm sitting here sweating,\n\n1838\n01:31:05,777 --> 01:31:06,956\nlike oh my gosh, oh my gosh.\n\n1839\n01:31:06,956 --> 01:31:09,983\n[LAUGH]\n>> It would be difficult to export\n\n1840\n01:31:09,983 --> 01:31:11,470\na running virtual machine.\n\n1841\n01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:14,748\nSo that's why they hide\nthat from you there.\n\n1842\n01:31:14,748 --> 01:31:16,355\n>> [LAUGH] You trickster.\n\n1843\n01:31:16,355 --> 01:31:18,152\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so there we go.\n\n1844\n01:31:18,152 --> 01:31:19,185\nThere is the-\n>> I got him.\n\n1845\n01:31:19,185 --> 01:31:22,850\n[SOUND] [LAUGH]\n>> There is the export, right?\n\n1846\n01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,460\nAnd so, export out.\n\n1847\n01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:25,430\nWe pick a location.\n\n1848\n01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:29,694\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right now we're going to export\n\n1849\n01:31:29,694 --> 01:31:33,788\nthis guy to an external hard drive and\n\n1850\n01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:39,776\nwe'll just say, Ready for\nprod, ready for production.\n\n1851\n01:31:39,776 --> 01:31:40,276\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1852\n01:31:44,506 --> 01:31:46,031\n>> And there it goes, so that's it.\n\n1853\n01:31:46,031 --> 01:31:47,010\nJust like that.\n\n1854\n01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:47,660\n>> That's it.\n\n1855\n01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:51,320\nNow you copy that whole folder\nover to your production server.\n\n1856\n01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:54,320\nGo into your Hyper-V console\non your production server.\n\n1857\n01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,299\nAnd you can see the option on our\nscreen here up towards the top,\n\n1858\n01:31:57,299 --> 01:32:00,763\njust underneath New,\nyou have Import Virtual Machine.\n\n1859\n01:32:00,763 --> 01:32:04,708\nYou point it to the folder, and it would\nsee all the appropriate files inside\n\n1860\n01:32:04,708 --> 01:32:07,866\nthere, import it, and voila,\nit shows up in your console.\n\n1861\n01:32:07,866 --> 01:32:12,769\n>> Mm-hm, so it'll appear in the menu up\nthere with all the other virtual machines\n\n1862\n01:32:12,769 --> 01:32:14,728\nand just come right up, right?\n\n1863\n01:32:14,728 --> 01:32:15,726\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1864\n01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:19,530\nIf this wasn't taking quite so\nlong we could actually turn around and\n\n1865\n01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:23,115\nimport it right back into our same\nconsole just to prove a point.\n\n1866\n01:32:23,115 --> 01:32:25,555\nBut it is gonna be\na little lengthy process.\n\n1867\n01:32:25,555 --> 01:32:28,945\nI can't remember if we did differencing\ndrives on that one, I don't think we did.\n\n1868\n01:32:28,945 --> 01:32:32,840\nOh snapshot, but it's gotta worry about\nall that, merge all those changes back so.\n\n1869\n01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:35,790\n>> Nice.\n\n1870\n01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:36,290\n>> That's it.\n\n1871\n01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:41,070\n>> All right, yeah, well there we go.\n\n1872\n01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:46,446\nThere's Hyper-V, a kind of a broad\nbasic overview of Hyper-V and\n\n1873\n01:32:46,446 --> 01:32:50,060\nsome of the stuff that this guy does.\n\n1874\n01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:54,810\n>> Really should be enough to get you\nstarted in your practicing with Hyper-V.\n\n1875\n01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:58,730\nGive you the chance to get in there and\n\n1876\n01:32:58,730 --> 01:33:01,530\nbuild your own virtual machine,\nset up your own little test network.\n\n1877\n01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:05,620\nAs we said at the beginning of the show,\nI think it's a great technology.\n\n1878\n01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:07,300\nOne, you're gonna need it, right.\n\n1879\n01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:10,960\nI mean, it's in every production\nenvironment that you go to now,\n\n1880\n01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,920\nyou're gonna be dealing with some\ntype of virtualization technology.\n\n1881\n01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,005\nTwo, it's on the exam.\n\n1882\n01:33:16,005 --> 01:33:18,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We kind of want the certification so\n\n1883\n01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,660\nwe can get that job.\n\n1884\n01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,910\nSo we gotta know for that.\n\n1885\n01:33:20,910 --> 01:33:23,450\nAnd three,\nit's a great way to practice this stuff.\n\n1886\n01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:24,365\nWhen you're studying,\n\n1887\n01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:28,490\nlike I was saying earlier,\nhow do you practice with this stuff?\n\n1888\n01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,270\nSometimes we\n\n1889\n01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:33,020\nmaybe borrow the spouse's computer-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1890\n01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:33,630\n>> Or the kid's\n\n1891\n01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:34,670\ncomputer-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1892\n01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:35,390\n>> And that\n\n1893\n01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:37,240\ntypically doesn't go over too well, right?\n\n1894\n01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:41,895\nWhen you say, yeah, honey I\naccidentally formatted your hard drive.\n\n1895\n01:33:41,895 --> 01:33:44,619\nThat might not fly, you might be in\nthe doghouse for a little while.\n\n1896\n01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:50,130\nSo virtual environments are a great way to\nkeep yourself from sleeping on the couch.\n\n1897\n01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:53,080\nYeah, and it's fun.\n\n1898\n01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:56,600\nI mean, come on, we're making virtual\nnetworks, and virtual machines and\n\n1899\n01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,790\nvirtual servers.\n\n1900\n01:33:57,790 --> 01:34:00,225\nI can have an entire enterprise\nrunning on my little laptop here.\n\n1901\n01:34:00,225 --> 01:34:01,827\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1902\n01:34:01,827 --> 01:34:03,080\n>> Assuming I had enough memory.\n\n1903\n01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,242\n>> Yes.\n>> And the resources.\n\n1904\n01:34:04,242 --> 01:34:06,407\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, assuming you have the resources.\n\n1905\n01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:09,300\n>> So yeah, it's just a fantastic thing.\n\n1906\n01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,411\nI think we did a good job.\n\n1907\n01:34:12,411 --> 01:34:13,375\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1908\n01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:17,396\nAnd I guess to reiterate what Mike said,\n\n1909\n01:34:17,396 --> 01:34:22,020\nthe best way to cement\neverything is to use it.\n\n1910\n01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:25,590\nPlay around it with it, Hyper-V\nincluded with Windows 8 Pro Enterprise.\n\n1911\n01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:30,258\nFire the thing up, and go onto\nMicrosoft's website, I believe now,\n\n1912\n01:34:30,258 --> 01:34:36,540\nto get evaluation editions of Windows 8,\n\n1913\n01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,410\nhas a limited time, 90 days, to use it.\n\n1914\n01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:41,615\nYou can use as I-\n>> Server as well I believe.\n\n1915\n01:34:41,615 --> 01:34:43,630\n>> Yeah, Server as well.\n\n1916\n01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:45,480\nFire everything up in Hyper-V.\n\n1917\n01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:48,110\nIt's all right there, it's ready to go.\n\n1918\n01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:49,527\n>> It's a beautiful thing.\n>> Beautiful thing.\n\n1919\n01:34:49,527 --> 01:34:55,901\nAll right everybody, well thanks again for\nHyper-V lesson, and we'll wrap it up here.\n\n1920\n01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:56,690\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1921\n01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:58,640\n>> All right, see you next time.\n\n1922\n01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:08,640\n[MUSIC]\n\n1923\n01:35:10,285 --> 01:35:17,400\n[SOUND]\n\n",

segment of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,880\nWhere we're going through the new,\nupdated for January 2014,\n\n5\n00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,200\nexam objectives for the 70-687 exam.\n\n6\n00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,540\nThey made some minor adjustments.\n\n7\n00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,630\n>> Right.\n>> Added a few little things, and\n\n8\n00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,830\nwe need to make sure we cover all the\nbases for what you might see on the exam.\n\n9\n00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,860\nToday we're gonna be jumping in to some,\nsome driver stuff that they added.\n\n10\n00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,944\nIt, objectives 2.1.3 and 2.1.4.\n\n11\n00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,220\nWhich we've kind of already-\n>> Right.\n\n12\n00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,020\n>> talked about right?\n\n13\n00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,740\nYou know in a previous show\nwhere we've done the install and\n\n14\n00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,905\nupdate, disable, resolve driver issues.\n\n15\n00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So some of this might be a little\n\n16\n00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,310\nrepetitious, but again it's important\nto make sure that you guys prepare for\n\n17\n00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,590\neverything that might\nturn up on that exam.\n\n18\n00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,810\n>> All right so one thing I want to\nmention right off the bat is starting in\n\n20\n00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,330\nWindows Vista with the 64-bit OS's,\nwe started to see this new requirement\n\n21\n00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,970\nthat any driver we installed in\nWindows be digitally signed.\n\n22\n00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,850\nThe idea is that if you're gonna install a\ndriver, that it should digitally signed by\n\n23\n00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,690\neither a trusted vendor or\nMicrosoft themselves so\n\n24\n00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,870\nthat you have a way to verify whether\nit's been tampered with or modified.\n\n25\n00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,973\nIf somebody really wants\nto pull off a good attack,\n\n26\n00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:17,530\nthey can nest a root kit or malware\nof some sort into a driver package.\n\n27\n00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,265\nAnd when you install a driver,\n\n28\n00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,720\nit has practically unlimited access-\n>> Yeah\n\n29\n00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,859\n>> to the kernel space on your system and\n\n30\n00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:26,210\nit's running with system privileges.\n\n31\n00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,260\nSo, it's basically an administrator\nright out of the box.\n\n32\n00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,710\nYou know, so so malicious drivers\nare definitely something to watch out for.\n\n33\n00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,390\nBut digitally signed driver requirement is\n\n34\n00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,930\nsomething that helps to\nprotect us from that.\n\n35\n00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,430\n>> Yeah, and when we first start off\nwith a 64-bit Operating Systems,\n\n36\n00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,820\nno matter what, they absolutely said,\nwhat, you have to have it.\n\n37\n00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,730\nThere, there was really no easy way around\nthat idea, because they really didn't\n\n38\n00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,830\nwant anybody being under the install, in,\nin terms of 64-bit Operating Systems.\n\n39\n00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,850\nAny drivers that may have a chance\nof corrupting anything that\n\n40\n00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,695\nthey installed in.\n\n41\n00:01:57,695 --> 00:01:58,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, so\n\n42\n00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,080\nit was really a, kind of a,\na strict requirement here.\n\n43\n00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,930\nBut, there are times when you still do\nneed access to those unsigned drivers.\n\n44\n00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,700\nYeah.\n\n45\n00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,526\nIf you are a hardware developer-\n>> Yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:11,550\n>> Or if you're building your own\nhardware, or if you're, you know,\n\n47\n00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,700\nparticipating in some kind\nof open source project.\n\n48\n00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,825\n>> Right.\n>> You see this a lot.\n\n49\n00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:15,501\n>> Yeah.\n>> Nate and\n\n50\n00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,941\nI were talking about it\nbefore the show that\n\n51\n00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,479\nlike if you wanted to use a Playstation\ngame controller with your PC,\n\n52\n00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,040\nthere is no official Playstation driver.\n\n53\n00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,280\nBut there's, you know,\nopen source people who write their own.\n\n54\n00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,620\nWell, they're not digitally signed.\n\n55\n00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,700\nThey're not gonna submit that and\npay the fee to have Microsoft sign it and\n\n56\n00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,690\nyou know,\nthey're not a trusted provider themselves.\n\n57\n00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,910\nSo if you wanna run a driver like that,\nWindows won't let you.\n\n58\n00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,580\nIt blocks the installation.\n\n59\n00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,980\nWell, if you absolutely know\nwhat you're doing, right?\n\n60\n00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,810\nYou, you don't want to do\nthis on a normal machine.\n\n61\n00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,194\nYou can temporarily, or even permanently,\ndisable driver signing on your system.\n\n62\n00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:49,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n63\n00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,160\n>> The instant you do that Microsoft\nwill no longer support you,\n\n64\n00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,220\nyou can not call Microsoft, you can\nnot open a support ticket with them.\n\n65\n00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,585\nThey will not help you.\n\n66\n00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,530\n>> Yeah.\n>> But if you have a specific need for\n\n67\n00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,115\nit, you can, you can do it.\n\n68\n00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:00,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,990\n>> And Ronnie you want to\ndemonstrate how that's done.\n\n70\n00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,694\n>> Yep\n>> To, to do this requires a reboot.\n\n71\n00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:08,775\nAnd normally we digitally share our screen\nwith you guys so you can see it real nice,\n\n72\n00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:11,395\nbut here we got to we got to\nrely on an external camera so\n\n73\n00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:13,220\nit is a little bit different for us.\n\n74\n00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,370\n>> So on my windows 8.1 machine for\nus as we go through, I'm just\n\n75\n00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,190\ngoing to do a finger swipe over here and\nthen I'm going to click on Settings and\n\n76\n00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,210\ndown here at the bottom where\nit says Change PC settings,\n\n77\n00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,760\nI know that is a little bit\nblurry because of the angle here.\n\n78\n00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,000\n>> But where is says Change PC Settings,\nwe're gonna select that.\n\n79\n00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,050\nAnd then over here on the left\nhand side where it says Update and\n\n80\n00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,210\nRecovery is where we're going.\n\n81\n00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,470\nAnd notice that we have three options\nover here under Update and Recovery.\n\n82\n00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,900\nWe need to select Recovery here, okay?\n\n83\n00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,068\nSo that now gives us different\nthings that we can do,\n\n84\n00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:46,470\nthe refresh, the idea the resetting\nthe PC, but what we're looking for\n\n85\n00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,570\nis right here under\nthe Advanced startup features.\n\n86\n00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,720\nNow it's kinda involved in that just to\n\n87\n00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,210\nget here is pretty darn\nhefty to actually do this.\n\n88\n00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,532\nAnd I remember when I first switched\nover from Windows 7 it's like,\n\n89\n00:03:58,532 --> 00:03:59,920\nwell where do you find this?\n\n90\n00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,050\nIt's almost difficult to actually find.\n\n91\n00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,720\nYou select.\n\n92\n00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,250\nOop, I shouldn't have\nselected restart now.\n\n93\n00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,970\nWell but you have to.\n\n94\n00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,890\n>> There you go, there you go.\nSo you select that and\n\n95\n00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,640\nit scares you a little bit, but notice now\nyou have different options here, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,090\nThe turn off your PC, the continue and\ngo back and it will just reboot.\n\n97\n00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,450\nUse the device here that is\nright here under Troubleshooting\n\n98\n00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,840\nwhere you actually have that to get to the\nadvanced tools and from there you need to\n\n99\n00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,270\ngo to Advanced options\n>> Underneath our settings.\n\n100\n00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,110\nAnd at this point, it is under\nStartup Settings, as where we have it.\n\n101\n00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,720\nOkay?\n\n102\n00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,075\nSo once I select that option, and\nthis is where you see the listing and\n\n103\n00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,925\nagain, I don't know if\nyou can actually see it.\n\n104\n00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,493\nIt's the third from the bottom one,\n\n105\n00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:50,060\nthat says to disable driver\nsignature enforcement.\n\n106\n00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,725\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n107\n00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:55,550\nthat's the option that we're really\nlooking for at this point here, okay?\n\n108\n00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,060\nSo this will get us into that,\n\n109\n00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,560\nwhat we used to call the advanced\nstartup options here.\n\n110\n00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,705\n>> I wish I would have counted, Ronnie.\n\n111\n00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:07,390\nCuz you, you probably went through like\nten different clicks to get to this point.\n\n112\n00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, so you really had to,\n\n113\n00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,130\nto move through them.\n\n114\n00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:10,680\n>> And there it is.\n\n115\n00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,155\nSo now notice that you, oops, sorry,\nI keep twisting it when I touch it here.\n\n116\n00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:16,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there it is, and\n\n117\n00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,740\nwhat we're looking for\nis the seventh option, 'kay?\n\n118\n00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,480\nAs well.\n\n119\n00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,340\nSo it says at this point here,\npress a number that I want.\n\n120\n00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,680\nAnd.\n\n121\n00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,960\n>> And you hit your keyboard,\nwill it let you touch it?\n\n122\n00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,120\nIs it, is it a touch button?\n\n123\n00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,190\n>> I'll see.\n\n124\n00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,870\nNope, it will not.\n\n125\n00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,320\n>> Oh, we gotta do the keyboard.\n\n126\n00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,140\n>> Yup.\n>> So, you know, one of the,\n\n127\n00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,700\none of the problems about\nthese tablet interfaces,\n\n128\n00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,800\nis you know, if you use the,\nthe fold over keyboard.\n\n129\n00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,030\nWhen you start going into\nthese low level bios type\n\n130\n00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,090\nscreens,\n>> Yeah.\n\n131\n00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,310\n>> you, you lose that ability,\n>> Yeah.\n\n132\n00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,850\n>> So.\nWhy,\n\n133\n00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,350\nwhy\n>> Okay.\n\n134\n00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,060\n>> don't you just unfold the whole laptop\n\n135\n00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,040\nand, and see if we can lay it\n>> There.\n\n136\n00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,900\n>> flattish or whatever.\n\n137\n00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,612\n>> I can do it this way.\n\n138\n00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:53,700\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll work it out one way or another.\n\n139\n00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,730\nThere we go.\n\n140\n00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,642\n>> I'm going to try and go [INAUDIBLE]\n>> You know, unfortunately,\n\n141\n00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:57,940\nyou can't be running any software\n>> Yeah.\n\n142\n00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,640\n>> at this point, so our, our screen\nsharing software isn't, isn't running but\n\n143\n00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,190\nlet's, let's\n>> Yep.\n\n144\n00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,390\n>> jump back to the skycam [CROSSTALK]\n>> Let's see.\n\n145\n00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,380\n>> crooked,\n>> Oh.\n\n146\n00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,050\n>> What'd you do?\n\n147\n00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,870\nDid you hit the power button?\n\n148\n00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,670\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH] Well anyhow.\n\n149\n00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,320\nYou know what?\n\n150\n00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,990\nWhat we want to do.\n>> It absolutely has\n\n151\n00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,030\nturned off completely.\n\n152\n00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,490\n>> Is is, you know,\nyou basically press number seven.\n\n153\n00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:17,990\nAnd.\n>> Yeah.\n\n154\n00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,700\n>> And from there it\n\n155\n00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,500\nreboots.\n>> Yeah.\n\n156\n00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,750\n>> And when it comes back up,\n\n157\n00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,580\nit now has that,\nthat driver signing disabled, and.\n\n158\n00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,300\n>> Now the funny thing is it says about\nusing the F9, one, one through F9 keys.\n\n159\n00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,720\nSo we need to actually be able to\nchoose that, so number seven here,\n\n160\n00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,360\nwould be F7, F7.\n\n161\n00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,640\nAll right.\n>> There we go.\n\n162\n00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,560\n>> And now it's gonna reboot.\n\n163\n00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,060\nNow Windows is gonna look\npretty normal as it reboots.\n\n164\n00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,000\nBut remember it,\nit's not very normal at all.\n\n165\n00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,300\n>> Yep.\n>> It's disabled\n\n166\n00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:42,800\nits-\n>> Right.\n\n167\n00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,080\n>> Driver signing so.\n\n168\n00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,625\nThere you go Ryan.\n\n169\n00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Why don't you go ahead and\n\n170\n00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,610\nget logged back into that.\n\n171\n00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,500\nAnd and so he's gonna log back in,\nand there'll be just a few\n\n172\n00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,490\nlittle differences that let us know\ndigital driver signing is turned off.\n\n173\n00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,115\nAnd first off,\n\n174\n00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:57,215\nwe'll now be able to install drivers\nthat are not digitally signed.\n\n175\n00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, there, there's that.\n\n176\n00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,180\nAnd secondly, on your desktop,\nRonny let's pull your desktop back up.\n\n177\n00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,840\n>> Okay\n>> On the,\n\n178\n00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,560\noh we got our white IT Pro TV logo so\nwe can't see it, but\n\n179\n00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,950\nthere is actually a little bit of white-\n>> Yeah.\n\n180\n00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,130\n>> text that is down here.\n\n181\n00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,060\nIt's letting us know that we're\nrunning in, in basically a test mode.\n\n182\n00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,320\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is what it says.\n\n183\n00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,090\nAnd that's Microsoft's way\nof reminding you that hey,\n\n184\n00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,950\nthis is not the supported\nway to run Windows.\n\n185\n00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,090\n>> Right.\n>> You've disabled a key security feature\n\n186\n00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,530\nand and so\n>> Mm-hm,\n\n187\n00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,720\n>> You know, you're putting yourself at\n\n188\n00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,190\nrisk and it's your own problem, right?\n\n189\n00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,120\n>> Right.\n>> So, so\n\n190\n00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,920\nyou may see it referred to\nas test mode sometimes, but\n\n191\n00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,670\nit is just disabling that driver signing.\n\n192\n00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,350\nSo if you need to,\nto build your own driver for\n\n193\n00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,300\nhardware that you're creating this is\nprobably something that you'll need to do.\n\n194\n00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,010\nIf you're just downloading a driver from\nlike an Android development website.\n\n195\n00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,620\n>> Right.\n>> And I know I've done that one before.\n\n196\n00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,055\nYou know, or somebody like that,\nyou're really taking a risk.\n\n197\n00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:50,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You're saying I\n\n198\n00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,350\ntrust that whoever made this driver,\ndidn't do anything malicious in it.\n\n199\n00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,090\n>> Right.\nAnd unless you've done a code review,\n\n200\n00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,580\nyou don't really know whether-\n>> Yeah.\n\n201\n00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,200\n>> Or\nnot they've done something malicious.\n\n202\n00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,218\nSo you are, are basically just\ntaking responsibility for that.\n\n203\n00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:02,129\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n204\n00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,350\n>> All right.\n\n205\n00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,850\nThe the other thing that they added in the\nobjectives was managing driver packages.\n\n206\n00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,055\nAnd we've kind of already shown that.\n\n207\n00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We've shown installing them.\n\n208\n00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,660\nRolling them back.\n\n209\n00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,335\nAnd, and so on.\n\n210\n00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:14,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There is one other thing that I wanna\n\n211\n00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,220\nshow though, which is sometimes we\nhave a need to add a driver for\n\n212\n00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,650\nhardware that's not on our system yet,\nokay?\n\n213\n00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Something that we,\n\n214\n00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,800\nwe know we're gonna be adding\nthis hardware, but you know,\n\n215\n00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,060\nit's not here right now.\n\n216\n00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> And when you use the standard\n\n217\n00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,650\ndriver packages, that come with like a\nsetup, a lot of times you'll run them and\n\n218\n00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,440\nthey'll say, hardware not detected and\nthat's it, okay.\n\n219\n00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,420\n>> Yep.\n>> And then it won't let you install.\n\n220\n00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,415\nSo if you're trying to pre-stage a driver,\nlike, you know, for an image.\n\n221\n00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:41,750\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Or whatever, well you can use DISM,\n\n222\n00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,980\nthe, the D I S M command line utility\nto inject drivers into an image.\n\n223\n00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,510\n>> But on a live system, we can\nactually use the driver package itself.\n\n224\n00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,110\nAnd let me show you what I mean.\n\n225\n00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,830\nOn my desktop here I've,\nI've got a, a driver.\n\n226\n00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,880\nAnd this is actually a driver for\na touchpad.\n\n227\n00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,720\nBut not the, the one that I've got.\n\n228\n00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,870\nAnd and what you can do is in that driver,\nthere's an INF file.\n\n229\n00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,950\nAn INF file is what defines that driver.\n\n230\n00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,220\nAnd if you wanna install a driver for\nhardware that's not present,\n\n231\n00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,500\nyou can just right click on that INF and\nchoose install.\n\n232\n00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,010\nAnd it's gonna install it into\nthe driver store in Windows.\n\n233\n00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,250\nDoesn't matter if the hardware is there or\n\n234\n00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,580\nnot, it just copies it\ninto that driver store.\n\n235\n00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,750\nAnd once it's there,\nif I ever hook up this particular device,\n\n236\n00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,230\nwhich I don't think I could, but if I\ndid the driver would already be there,\n\n237\n00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,890\nit's ready to load.\n\n238\n00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,440\n>> Right.\n>> The end-user\n\n239\n00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,710\ndoesn't have to provide anything.\n\n240\n00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,850\nWe do this frequently with images, or\n\n241\n00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,150\nwith systems that we're gonna be sending\nout where maybe we had the desktop here.\n\n242\n00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,110\nBut we know when it gets to the customer's\nside that they have different hardware.\n\n243\n00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,250\nMaybe they have a scanner, or a printer,\nor something that we don't have here.\n\n244\n00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we might preload that driver so\n\n245\n00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,060\nit'll work as soon as they\nplug that hardware in.\n\n246\n00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, sorta kind of a, a cool thing.\n\n247\n00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,180\n>> Yeah, a lot of times we don't think\nabout it because of the universality of\n\n248\n00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,210\nplug and play today.\n\n249\n00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> About having to do anything like that.\n\n250\n00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,590\nBut, if you do happen to run into\ndevices that are not plug and play,\n\n251\n00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,690\nhopefully you won't, but if you do this is\nthe way that we can also do it as well.\n\n252\n00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,180\nThere's also that command line util,\nthat PnPUtil-a\n\n253\n00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,370\nthat will allow you to manually add\nthat into the driver store as well.\n\n254\n00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,400\n>> Yep.\n\n255\n00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,200\nSo, other than that, the only other thing\nthat we might do when it comes to driver\n\n256\n00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,030\npackages is like manipulating\nthe driver packages.\n\n257\n00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,110\n>> Yeah.\n>> But you gotta be careful.\n\n258\n00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,130\nYou can't really manipulate\na driver package.\n\n259\n00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,434\n>> Right.\n>> Let, let me go back to that folder and\n\n260\n00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,540\nshow you guys one of the other\nfiles that's in there.\n\n261\n00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,510\nWhen we deal with a true digitally signed,\ndigitally signed file.\n\n262\n00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,070\nAnd let, let me just find that file again.\n\n263\n00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,030\nI closed the window.\n\n264\n00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,100\nLet's see it was here.\n\n265\n00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,830\nAll right.\n\n266\n00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,990\nSo this is a,\na true digitally signed driver.\n\n267\n00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,110\nSo, so exactly what, what I want.\n\n268\n00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,210\nAnd when we look at the file\nlist that's in there,\n\n269\n00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,840\nthe INF that defines the driver itself and\nthen that's the main file.\n\n270\n00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840\nBut notice that there's another\nfile there that ends in dot c-a-t.\n\n271\n00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,360\nOkay.\n\n272\n00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,900\nIt's a catalogue file.\n\n273\n00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,600\nAnd in that catalogue file,\nif I edit that.\n\n274\n00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,430\nLet me just open with like Word Pad.\n\n275\n00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,870\nAnd what you're gonna see in here is,\nit's binary data.\n\n276\n00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,640\n>> Right.\n>> So it's kind of a mess, but\n\n277\n00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,580\nas you scroll through, you can actually\nspot some of the text that's in there.\n\n278\n00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,010\nAnd in here it's\nidentifying several things.\n\n279\n00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,530\nFirst off it's identifying the certificate\nthat it was digitally signed\n\n280\n00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,200\nwith\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n281\n00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,090\n>> and then it's got the digital\nsignature in it not just for, for\n\n282\n00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,380\nthe, the driver package as a whole, but\n\n283\n00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,350\nfor each individual file\n>> Mm.\n\n284\n00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,640\n>> in the driver which\nI'm trying to spot here.\n\n285\n00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,190\nThis, this is all pointing\nto the actual certificate.\n\n286\n00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,180\nSee, see you've got Microsoft\nroot certificate authority, that,\n\n287\n00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,000\nthat's letting me know that\nthis was signed by Microsoft.\n\n288\n00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,460\nAnd the third party component, you know,\n\n289\n00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,410\nso it's,\nit's got that information in there.\n\n290\n00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,560\nBut somewhere in here,\nusually you can see it.\n\n291\n00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,510\nWell like here.\n\n292\n00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,618\nSo you've got cysmb.inf and\nthen some gibberish.\n\n293\n00:11:44,618 --> 00:11:50,000\nAnd cysmb.sys and\nthen some gibberish and so on.\n\n294\n00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,390\n>> Mm.\n>> These are the digital signatures for\n\n295\n00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,990\neach of the individual files.\n\n296\n00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,190\nSo if you modify a file\ninside of a driver package,\n\n297\n00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,600\nthe signatures will no longer match,\nand now it's broken.\n\n298\n00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,101\n>> Yep.\n>> Right.\n\n299\n00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:02,534\nSo when it comes to managing\n\n300\n00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:03,096\na driver-\n>> Hm.\n\n301\n00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,271\n>> Package, we usually install or\n\n302\n00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:07,373\nuninstall, or whatever.\nBut\n\n303\n00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:09,160\nwe rarely modify.\n>> Not modify.\n\n304\n00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,520\n>> And if you do want to modify,\n\n305\n00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,010\ngenerating these binary files, is done\nwith the Windows Driver Kit, the WDK.\n\n306\n00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,210\nAnd or the Driver Development Kit.\n\n307\n00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,920\nAnd let me go see if I\ncan find that real quick.\n\n308\n00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,010\nHere we go.\nThe Windows Driver Kit.\n\n309\n00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,720\nAnd the Windows Driver Kit is free,\nyou can download it from Microsoft.\n\n310\n00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,475\nIt is designed to work with Visual Studio,\nwhich is not free.\n\n311\n00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:37,080\n[LAUGH] But the driver kit itself\nis free and it teaches you,\n\n312\n00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,130\nit gives you all the information\nyou need to create a driver.\n\n313\n00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,595\n>> It does everything\nexcept digitally sign it.\n\n314\n00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,930\n>> Right.\n>> And you can sign it with your own\n\n315\n00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,390\ncertificate, but\nnobody out there is gonna trust that.\n\n316\n00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,100\nAnd so, you really need to submit it\nto Microsoft or a third party that is,\n\n317\n00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,265\nis allowed to digitally sign,\nget it authorized and go that way.\n\n318\n00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, so just keep that in mind, you\n\n319\n00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,810\ncan manipulate the actual driver package,\nbut you will break the digital signature.\n\n320\n00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,770\nAll right.\n\n321\n00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,270\nAnd if that's something you need to do,\n\n322\n00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,450\nthen you just do what Ronnie did at the-\n>> Yeah.\n\n323\n00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,830\n>> Beginning of the episode and,\nand you just go through and\n\n324\n00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,751\ndisable digital driver signing-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n325\n00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:08,804\n>> And [CROSSTALK] you'll be fine.\n\n326\n00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:09,663\n>> Ready to go.\nYep.\n\n327\n00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,685\n>> Yep.\n\n328\n00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:11,381\nAll right.\n\n329\n00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,900\nRonnie, can you think of anything else\nthat we need to mention on this one?\n\n330\n00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,250\n>> I don't think so.\n\n331\n00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,420\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat kind of wraps this one up.\n\n332\n00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,570\nDefinitely stay tuned for\n\n333\n00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,880\nmore of these, these one off\nlittle segments that we're doing.\n\n334\n00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,900\nJust trying to,\nto cover everything that's new and\n\n335\n00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,890\neverything that's added to make sure\nyou're ready when you go take that exam.\n\n336\n00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,120\nYou don't want any surprises.\n\n337\n00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,860\n>> True.\n\n338\n00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,239\n>> All right.\nHope you guys enjoyed it, and\n\n339\n00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,041\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n340\n00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:36,599\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

be tackling,\n\n3\n00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:15,362\nsome of the, the new topics\nthat have been added to the,\n\n4\n00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:19,869\nthe Windows 8 exam for\nwell, for 2014 right?\n\n5\n00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:20,438\n>> Yeah.\n\n6\n00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,436\n>> In January 2014 Microsoft,\n\n7\n00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:26,574\nfinally got around to updating\nthe exam to reflect Windows 8.1 and\n\n8\n00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:31,610\nin all of our episodes we've used Windows\n8.1 even before it was on the exam.\n\n9\n00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,430\nCuz we knew it was coming.\n\n10\n00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:32,970\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n11\n00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,020\nwhen they updated the objective there\nwere, there were a few little bits and\n\n12\n00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,510\npieces that were added in, and\nand so we're just going back and\n\n13\n00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,030\nfilming these specials to cover those and\nmake sure that we've covered\n\n14\n00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,370\nevery single topic that you\nmight see creep up on that exam.\n\n15\n00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,770\n>> Yeah, now you may also end up hitting\nanother episode which seems like it\n\n16\n00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,970\noverlaps a little bit perfectly fine\nrepetition is actually good for\n\n17\n00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,860\nus, it helps us to actually reinforce it,\nand allows us another chance to make\n\n18\n00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,790\nsure we cover that particular side\nthat's emphasized a little bit more.\n\n19\n00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,768\nSo, sometimes we might have\nmentioned it in passing,\n\n20\n00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:03,453\nnow we're going to get\nmore detailed into it.\n\n21\n00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:05,159\nSo, it's, it's a good topic for us.\n\n22\n00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:05,684\n>> Absolutely.\n\n23\n00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:07,924\nAll right, so, the one we're\ngoing to hit today, or the two,\n\n24\n00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,500\nwe're going to hit two on this one, right?\n\n25\n00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,930\n>> Yes.\n>> So the first thing that we're going to\n\n26\n00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,900\nhit is software restriction policies.\n\n27\n00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,910\n>> Right.\n>> And if, if you've been watching the 688\n\n28\n00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,420\nshow-\n>> Yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,220\n>> The, the 70S 688 show, we, we cover it\nthere, but now it's on this exam also.\n\n30\n00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,700\n>> Right.\n>> So, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,200\njust kind of double up software\nrestriction policies if you've never heard\n\n32\n00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,830\nof them, is where basically we can\nlock somebody's account down or,\n\n33\n00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,461\nor everybody's account down-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n34\n00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:33,410\n>> So that either,\nwe kind of have a choice.\n\n35\n00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,640\n>> Yep.\n>> They can only run certain applications\n\n36\n00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,430\nand nothing else, or\n\n37\n00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,310\nthey can run everything except certain\napplications that we choose to buy.\n\n38\n00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,190\nWe just get to pick, and\nchoose what people are allowed to run\n\n39\n00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,050\nthis is awesome if you're running labs or\nshared machines,\n\n40\n00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,190\nkiosk type environments, where you don't\nwant people installing software, running\n\n41\n00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,146\nall sorts of crazy stuff you want to lock\nthem into a handful of applications.\n\n42\n00:01:58,146 --> 00:02:01,940\nYou know, I, I really do wish that more\nbusinesses did this, because, you know,\n\n43\n00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,870\nyour computer when you're at work,\nis a tool for you to do your job.\n\n44\n00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,310\nBut a lot of companies give you just open\ninternet access, administrative rights,\n\n45\n00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,520\nand, and you get people that get infected\nmachines, viruses and stuff that,\n\n46\n00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,525\nif you just lock down the software they\ncould run, that wouldn't have happened.\n\n47\n00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:18,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Most\n\n48\n00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,740\norganizations never think about that.\n\n49\n00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,260\n>> No, no.\nThere,\n\n50\n00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,840\nthere would not ever be a user, that would\nactually personally download software\n\n51\n00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,340\nthat they weren't told to download and\ninstall them on the workstation.\n\n52\n00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,680\n>> That's crazy talk.\n\n53\n00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520\nI mean, who would do that?\n\n54\n00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,351\n>> That is crazy talk.\n\n55\n00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:30,987\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:33,014\nAnd they would never call\nthe help desk saying,\n\n57\n00:02:33,014 --> 00:02:35,243\nI don't know what happened\nto my computer and,\n\n58\n00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:39,100\nI don't know why this piece of software\nkeeps appearing on my computer as well.\n\n59\n00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,120\n>> My, my absolute favorite, Ronnie is, is\nthe first question I ask is, okay have you\n\n60\n00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,600\nmade any changes to your computer recently\nor have you installed any new software.\n\n61\n00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,405\nWhat's the answer?\n\n62\n00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:49,665\nNo\n>> No, no, of course not,\n\n63\n00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:50,795\nI didn't install anything.\n\n64\n00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,895\nBut then you sit down at the computer and\nyou start to work on it and they're like,\n\n65\n00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,405\noh you know I did do that update,\n\n66\n00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:58,475\nand oh I did install this software but\nthat doesn't count, right?\n\n67\n00:02:58,475 --> 00:02:59,715\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yes it counts and\n\n68\n00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:02,935\nyou shouldn't be allowed to use\nthe computer so so that's where we have\n\n69\n00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:07,495\ntools like software restriction policies\nthat let us kind of curb that and, and\n\n70\n00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:10,645\nlock that down so people can't just go and\nrun all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:11,590\n>> Yeah.\n\n72\n00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,270\n>> Now softer restriction policies,\n\n73\n00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,854\nthey're pretty easy to implement\nwe're doing the Windows 8 show, so\n\n74\n00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:20,619\nwe're gonna show you how to do it right\nhere on a single Windows 8 workstation.\n\n75\n00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:21,559\n>> Right.\n\n76\n00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,719\n>> For those of you who go on to do like,\nthe server certifications,\n\n77\n00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,875\nyou'll see how to do\nthis via group policy.\n\n78\n00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Where you can apply to 100 or\n\n79\n00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,233\n1000 of computers at once and\nthat's even more awesome.\n\n80\n00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:31,851\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n81\n00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:35,688\n>> Like for schools or, or, or, you know,\nindustrial complexes or whatever where you\n\n82\n00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:39,095\ncan apply that to many, many machines so\nvery flexible, very neat stuff.\n\n83\n00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:39,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n84\n00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,330\nYeah.\n\n85\n00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,880\nDoing it on a single machine for us,\nreally does help us in that situation\n\n86\n00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,820\nsay there is shared computers,\nour shared work stations I should say, and\n\n87\n00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,190\nit allows us to make sure that\nwe implement the policy and\n\n88\n00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,950\nit applies pretty much to everybody\nthat uses that one machine.\n\n89\n00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,090\nThis is a really good, good point for\nus so that nobody gets the chance to\n\n90\n00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,700\ninstall something and then somebody else\ncomes along, goes aah, I don't want that\n\n91\n00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,690\ninstalled and then uninstall it,\nand we control the access that way.\n\n92\n00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,924\n>> Yep.\nAll right,so, so\n\n93\n00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:10,229\nlet's take an example here I've, I've got\na Windows 8.1 machine fired up, and, and\n\n94\n00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,516\nI'm running Windows 8.1 enterprise,\nbut this, this works on,\n\n95\n00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:16,915\non all the different versions and\nand basically let's say that I,\n\n96\n00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:19,778\nI really don't want people to\nrun the Windows calculator.\n\n97\n00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:20,824\nBoy, it ticks me off when they use they\n\n98\n00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:21,334\nuse-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,113\n>> The Windows calculator.\n\n100\n00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:23,626\nI need to stop that all right, so\n\n101\n00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:26,050\nI'm gonna create a software\nrestriction policy.\n\n102\n00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,220\nIt's gonna say you're,\nyou're allowed to run whatever you want.\n\n103\n00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,440\nBut I wanna block that\ncalculator [CROSSTALK].\n\n104\n00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,369\nAll right.\n\n105\n00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:34,360\nNow if we're doing this on a domain and,\nand attaching it to 1000 of computers.\n\n106\n00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,890\nWe would do this as a group policy\nobject in the active directory.\n\n107\n00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,160\nIf we're just doing it\non one machine though,\n\n108\n00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,120\nwe do it as a group policy object\nright here on the machine.\n\n109\n00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,010\nSo I'm going to bring up my start menu and\nI'll just go into my group policy.\n\n110\n00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,150\nAnd I'm just doing a quick search for\nthe word group and you'll see the very\n\n111\n00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,670\nfirst link that comes up is edit group\npolicy and that's exactly what I want.\n\n112\n00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,873\nNow when we launch the group policy editor\non our local machine it's going to show us\n\n113\n00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,159\nthe policy well,\n>> Mm-hm\n\n114\n00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,424\n>> Or the local machine.\n\n115\n00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:07,442\nAnd you know it occurs to me here\nRonnie that that's going to be a little\n\n116\n00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:12,061\nsmall let me let me turn on my zoom in\ntool, so I can try and do that but,\n\n117\n00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:16,560\nall right so when we go in here\nsoftware restriction policies?\n\n118\n00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,530\nThey're a computer setting,\n\n119\n00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,250\nbecause they can apply regardless\nof who the user account is, and\n\n120\n00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,750\nyou can go through and you can specify\nyour restrictions, limitations and so on.\n\n121\n00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,500\nAnd so, I'm gonna go under computer\nconfiguration, and Windows settings.\n\n122\n00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,380\nAnd under Windows settings,\nit's gonna think for a second.\n\n123\n00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,900\nAnd then we get security settings.\n\n124\n00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,575\nAnd under security settings, we will\nfind software restriction policies.\n\n125\n00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right?\n\n126\n00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,569\nNow, if this is your\nfirst time coming here,\n\n127\n00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:47,449\nit's going to be empty because, you know.\n\n128\n00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,065\n>> We don't have any.\n\n129\n00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:50,282\n>> Yeah.\nThe default on Windows is that anybody\n\n130\n00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:54,115\ncan run any program, and if you're an\nadministrator, you can install programs,\n\n131\n00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:56,710\nright but otherwise,\nyou're not allowed to install.\n\n132\n00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,572\nAll right, so what I'm gonna do\nis I'll just right-click it.\n\n133\n00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:02,654\nThis is one of those, I think you\npointed this out in an episode, Ronnie,\n\n134\n00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,471\nwhere we have this little arrow over here.\n\n135\n00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:05,052\n>> Right.\n\n136\n00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:08,118\n>> And if you click the arrow there,\nthere's nothing inside of it so\n\n137\n00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,335\nit looks like it might expand but\nit doesn't.\n\n138\n00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n139\n00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,310\nRight.\n>> But I'll just right-click on it and\n\n140\n00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,010\nI'm gonna do a new software\nrestriction policy and\n\n141\n00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,110\nwhen you do that it's gonna create\nbasically like a whole tree structure.\n\n142\n00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Underneath it where\n\n143\n00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,370\nwe can start to define all sorts of\ndifferent things, like security levels and\n\n144\n00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,520\nadditional rules and, and you'll see under\nsecurity levels we, we have things like.\n\n145\n00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,360\n>> Disallow.\n>> Whether we're gonna disallow, and\n\n146\n00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,120\nif you look at these,\n\n147\n00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,117\nthese descriptions here, software will\nnot run regardless of the access rights.\n\n148\n00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:40,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of the user.\n\n149\n00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,350\nWe don't care if they're an administrator.\n\n150\n00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,810\n>> Right.\n>> We don't care whatever.\n\n151\n00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,900\nRight or here allows programs to\nexecute as a user that does not\n\n152\n00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,050\nhave administrative rights, so they can\nrun the software as a normal user but\n\n153\n00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,540\nthey cant elevate the privileges\nto administrator,\n\n154\n00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,140\nand then unrestricted that means they can\nrun whatever the heck they want right.\n\n155\n00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,900\nAnd you'll see there are some\nadditional rules buried\n\n156\n00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,020\nunder here where we can modify\ncertain registry keys and, and\n\n157\n00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,760\nthis is useful if you have particular\nthings that you need to tweak.\n\n158\n00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,730\nHere it's just verifying like\nwhere the system root and\n\n159\n00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,350\nwhere the program files folders are, so it\ncan use that as you know unrestricted to\n\n160\n00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,900\nmake sure that they're not\ngetting tied down all right.\n\n161\n00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,590\nIf we take something like this disallow\nrule here, we can pull up these properties\n\n162\n00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,760\njust to see some basic descriptions but we\ncan choose to set that as the default for\n\n163\n00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,530\nour users, in which case our users\nare going to be, our software\n\n164\n00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,100\nby default is going to be blocked, and\nthen we need to make rules to allow it.\n\n165\n00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,960\nOr I could say by default my\nsoftware is unrestricted, and\n\n166\n00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,486\nthen we can make rules to block what we\nwant you know it's up to us what we want\n\n167\n00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,300\nthe default behavior to be.\n\n168\n00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,347\nSo on my computer,\nI just want to block Windows calculator.\n\n169\n00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:56,155\n>> Right.\n>> I, I don't want to block anything else\n\n170\n00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:59,959\njust Windows calculator so I'm gonna to\nmake sure that unrestricted is my default.\n\n171\n00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,487\nAnd see how when I right click on\ndisallow set as default shows up and\n\n172\n00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:06,322\nwhen I right click on basic,\nset as default shows up.\n\n173\n00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:09,780\nWhen I right click on unrestricted,\nit doesn't show up.\n\n174\n00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,590\nThat's because it is the default.\n\n175\n00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,700\nSo if I wanted to blocked everything and\n\n176\n00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,720\nthen specifically approve certain apps,\nI would set disallowed as my default.\n\n177\n00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,170\nBut I don't, I want to allow everything\nand just block certain things,\n\n178\n00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,120\nso unrestricted is what I want.\n\n179\n00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,950\nAnd then I go under additional rules and\n\n180\n00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,370\nnow I need to specify exactly\nwhich apps I want to block.\n\n181\n00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:30,870\n>> Right.\n\n182\n00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,990\n>> So I'm gonna right-click here and\nchoose a new rule.\n\n183\n00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,440\nNow there's four types\nof rules we can make.\n\n184\n00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,300\nRight?\n\n185\n00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,500\nCertificate rule, hash rule,\nnetwork zone rule, and path rule, right?\n\n186\n00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,570\nPath rules are the most common.\n\n187\n00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,510\nBut let's, let's talk about each one and,\nand kind of what they do.\n\n188\n00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,200\nAnd I'll start with the first\none which is certificate rule.\n\n189\n00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,420\nIn Windows,\n\n190\n00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,190\nwhen a developer writes an application,\nthey can digitally sign the application.\n\n191\n00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,620\nThey can attach a certificate\nto the executable.\n\n192\n00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,160\nAnd we can use that certificate\nto identify the application.\n\n193\n00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,080\nAnd as new versions of the application\ncome out If they continue to use\n\n194\n00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,980\nthat same certificate, we can approve\nnot only that one version of the app,\n\n195\n00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,200\nbut every update that comes out for it.\n\n196\n00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,990\nBecause, you know, you might be running,\nlike, Notepad plus plus.\n\n197\n00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,240\n>> Right.\n>> You know, it's a third-party\n\n198\n00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,070\nnotepad program.\n\n199\n00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,835\nI use it every single day.\n\n200\n00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:22,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n201\n00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,267\n>> And, you know,\nyou might install version 4.1.1.\n\n202\n00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:30,590\nWhen version 4.1.2 comes out,\nit's an update but technically it's\n\n203\n00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,570\nan all-new program, and I don't want it to\ngo and write rules for that every time.\n\n204\n00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,120\nIf it's digitally signed,\nwe can do a certificate rule and\n\n205\n00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,450\nwe can approve the application\nbased on its certificate.\n\n206\n00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,562\nAnd I believe the calculator is digitally\nsigned, cause all of the Microsoft apps,\n\n207\n00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:49,658\nat this point are supposed\nto be digitally signed,\n\n208\n00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:52,470\nso let me just go and find the calculator.\n\n209\n00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:59,450\nOh, you know what, it wants me\nto find the certificate itself,\n\n210\n00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,870\nwhich, which I don't have, but it should\nbe able to pull it from the executable.\n\n211\n00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,680\nLet's see here if it'll do that for me.\n\n212\n00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,530\nNope, it is not pulling\nfrom the executable.\n\n213\n00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,900\nAll right, so if we have that certificate.\n\n214\n00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,540\nI don't have that certificate for the\ncalculator, then we can feed that in here,\n\n215\n00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,680\nand whatever application was signed with\nthat cert, we could either block or deny.\n\n216\n00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,020\nNormally you'd block or allow.\n\n217\n00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,770\nYou normally we want to allow that, but\nyeah, I don't have the certificate.\n\n218\n00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,770\nBut you would browse and\npick the certificate here and\n\n219\n00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,980\nthen you would set that status.\n\n220\n00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,777\nAny app, signed by that server\nwould now fall under this rule.\n\n221\n00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,877\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n222\n00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:39,730\nSpeaking of the second rule we have here,\nwe also have the hash rule.\n\n223\n00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,090\n>> The hash rule does exactly what,\nwhat we want to do,\n\n224\n00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,880\nwhich is to take that one file,\ngenerate a hash of it, and that uniquely\n\n225\n00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,170\nidentifies that particular executable,\nand so if you install a new one,\n\n226\n00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,000\nsuch as the updated versions that Don was\nmentioning just a little bit earlier.\n\n227\n00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,500\nIt doesn't block that one, but\nit will block this one here.\n\n228\n00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500\nNow this is really good in\ncertain situations, we,\n\n229\n00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,850\nwe talk about it with JAVA a lot right?\n\n230\n00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,950\nWhen we run things like our,\nour programs here to,\n\n231\n00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,910\nto interact with Cisco switches and\ndevices.\n\n232\n00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:16,615\nSometimes it requires JAVA one point\nfive point six point four point three,\n\n233\n00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:17,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n234\n00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,257\n>> And then we go and update that.\n\n235\n00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:20,464\n>> And it breaks everything.\n\n236\n00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:21,846\n>> And it breaks everything.\n\n237\n00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:26,016\n>> So by putting this hash roll in here,\nwe could actually say, we want to allow\n\n238\n00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:31,170\nthis one version, but not any of the other\nones that should un and we don't want to.\n\n239\n00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,400\nSo it's a good role for\nus to actually be able to take a look at.\n\n240\n00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,230\n>> Yep.\nThe next one is a network zone,\n\n241\n00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,990\nand with a network zone rule, this is\nwhere we allow or block applications.\n\n242\n00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,120\nBased on where they're stored.\n\n243\n00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,890\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you have something that's local\n\n244\n00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,770\non your machine,\nthen it's running in the local zone.\n\n245\n00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,190\nBut if you have things that\nare out on the network,\n\n246\n00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,345\nthen there's things that\nare on the public networks.\n\n247\n00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Private networks, work networks.\n\n248\n00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,020\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> And intranet networks.\n\n249\n00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,370\n>> Right.\n>> Those are like the four designated.\n\n250\n00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,980\nI know intranet's hidden from the GUI.\n\n251\n00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> But it does exist.\n\n252\n00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,810\n>> So so you've really got these,\nthese couple of different scopes for\n\n253\n00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,270\nnetwork zones, and so\nyou can say, you know what,\n\n254\n00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,110\nI'll allow executables to run from\nthe work zone, you know from,\n\n255\n00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,460\nfrom my domain, but I might not\nallow it to run from other zones.\n\n256\n00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,140\nAnd so you'll see here some of\nthe different zones you can pick from\n\n257\n00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,800\na local intranet would be like your work,\nright.\n\n258\n00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400\nYour business environment.\n\n259\n00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,820\nAnd so you might allow things to run\nfrom there, or a local computer.\n\n260\n00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,530\nBut on the internet you might not\nwant to allow something to run.\n\n261\n00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,670\nAnd so you can tailor your rules for\nthat, setting a default security level for\n\n262\n00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,320\nthose zones.\n\n263\n00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,820\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n264\n00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,270\n>> All right.\nAnd then the last one is the one that\n\n265\n00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,060\nused the most.\n\n266\n00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,580\nIt's the path rule.\n\n267\n00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,350\nThis is where we block or allow\napplications simply based on their file\n\n268\n00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,875\nname and\nthe folder that they're stored in.\n\n269\n00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now this is the easiest to use cuz we\n\n270\n00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,260\njust browse and pick the file and,\nand that's it, but\n\n271\n00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,185\nthere is a negative, all right?\n\n272\n00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:52,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n273\n00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,410\n>> So if I, if I created here, I'll, I'll\ncreate a path rule for the calculator.\n\n274\n00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,090\n>> Hm.\n\n275\n00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,280\n>> And so I wanna block, let's see.\n\n276\n00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,290\nIt's gonna be c colon and Windows.\n\n277\n00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,250\nAnd oh, you know what,\nactually I probably need to copy it out of\n\n278\n00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,630\nthe Windows directory because it's\ngoing to get a little angry at me.\n\n279\n00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:19,100\nIt, there's some special rules that\nare in place, just for Windows files.\n\n280\n00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,410\nBecause you need your operating\nsystem to be able to run and\n\n281\n00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,950\nthe Windows calculator is\ninside of that folder.\n\n282\n00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,320\nAnd so if I try and block something inside\nof the Windows folder gonna get mad at me.\n\n283\n00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,810\nSo, I'm just gonna create a,\n\n284\n00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,800\na new folder here on the same drive,\nwhich I will call, you know, customapp.\n\n285\n00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,632\nAll right, and I will copy the Windows\ncalculator into there, so it will still\n\n286\n00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:41,677\nuse the Windows calendar, I'm just\ngonna copy it to a different location.\n\n287\n00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:45,972\nAll right, here we go.\n\n288\n00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:52,856\nThere.\n\n289\n00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:53,575\nAll right.\n\n290\n00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:58,036\nSo, in here, I'm gonna browse to that\npath, so I'll go to this PC, c colon, and\n\n291\n00:13:58,036 --> 00:13:58,820\nCustom App.\n\n292\n00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,080\nAll right, oops.\n\n293\n00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,190\nActually, let me just pick\nthe app specifically.\n\n294\n00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,170\nThere.\n\n295\n00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,502\nSo I'm picking C:/Custom Apps/Calc.exe,\n\n296\n00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:11,600\nthat's the-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n297\n00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,740\n>> Calculator and\nI'm going to set it to disallow.\n\n298\n00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,980\nI don't want people to be able to\nrun this application, all right?\n\n299\n00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,860\nSo, my default rule said that all\napplications should be unrestricted.\n\n300\n00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,160\nNow I've got a customer\nrole that says this one ap,\n\n301\n00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,190\napplication should be restricted,\nright disallowed, alL right.\n\n302\n00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,070\nNotice these two roles up here\nthese are allowing system root and\n\n303\n00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,060\nthe program files directory,\n\n304\n00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,700\nit's allowing those programs to run by\ndefault you may or may not want that,\n\n305\n00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,960\nyou know so you, you have to tweak the\nrules to match what you're environment is.\n\n306\n00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,500\nYou, you'll definitely\nwant this one system\n\n307\n00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,071\nroot\n>> Yeah,\n\n308\n00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:42,731\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n309\n00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,790\nyou need Windows to be able run but\nother things may not.\n\n310\n00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,990\nSo, so I'm blocking that,\nnow here's the problem with a pathrule.\n\n311\n00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,430\nIf a user tries to run the program and\n\n312\n00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,445\nit doesn't run, all they have\nto do is rename that executable.\n\n313\n00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:56,726\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If they rename it\n\n314\n00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:59,570\nto calc2.exe\n>> Yeah.\n\n315\n00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,560\n>> It will run.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n316\n00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,240\n>> Right?\n\n317\n00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,050\nBut if you had done a hashrule-\n>> Yep.\n\n318\n00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,850\n>> Like Ronny was talking about.\n\n319\n00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,210\nYou would do a hash of that executable,\nthe data inside of that executable, and\n\n320\n00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,430\neven if you rename it,\nthe hash will still be the same.\n\n321\n00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,350\nAnd so you can block it even\nif they rename the file.\n\n322\n00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,440\nPath rules like this are great because\nthey take into account new versions.\n\n323\n00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,030\nIf I put in a new version, as long\nas it's called calc.exe, it's fine.\n\n324\n00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,940\nBut hash rules, their better because,\nyou know, they'll identify it\n\n325\n00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,440\neven if it's renamed, but\nthey don't take into account new versions.\n\n326\n00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,730\n>> Right.\n>> So every time a new version comes out,\n\n327\n00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,240\nyou gotta recalculate a hash.\n\n328\n00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,590\nSo those two are good, but they're not\nperfect, certificate rules are the best\n\n329\n00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,410\nbecause a certificate can be reused for\neach version.\n\n330\n00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,810\nSo, you can improve multiple\nversions with one rule.\n\n331\n00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,519\n>> Nice.\n>> You really had to look at these and\n\n332\n00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,552\njust figure out which one best\nsuits your needs, all right?\n\n333\n00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:54,396\nI wanna stick with this one\nbecause I'll be able to rename.\n\n334\n00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:55,007\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n335\n00:15:55,007 --> 00:16:00,364\nthere's a simple rule- We're pretty\nmuch allowing everything except for\n\n336\n00:16:00,364 --> 00:16:04,648\ncalc.exe in that particular\npath in the CustomApp folder.\n\n337\n00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:05,856\nAll right.\n\n338\n00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:09,505\nSo, now that I've got the software\nrestriction policy in place,\n\n339\n00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:10,790\nthat's it, right?\n\n340\n00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,850\nWe're done.\n\n341\n00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,540\nNow we just need to test it out.\n\n342\n00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,360\nSo I'm going to, well, first off,\n\n343\n00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,960\nI'm just gonna make sure I've got\nthe latest copy of the group policy.\n\n344\n00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,810\nIf you ever make a group policy change,\nit should take effect right away, but\n\n345\n00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,630\nsome changes can take up\nto 90 minutes to apply.\n\n346\n00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,520\nOther changes might\nrequire you to log out.\n\n347\n00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,519\n>> Yeah.\n>> And log back on before they apply.\n\n348\n00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,415\nSo I'm just gonna do\na gpupdate /force to make\n\n349\n00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:41,465\nsure it updates the policy right now.\n\n350\n00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then I'm gonna log in\n\n351\n00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,220\nas a different user.\n\n352\n00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,764\n>> Test it.\n\n353\n00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:47,489\n>> A non administrative user,\nand see how it works.\n\n354\n00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,420\nThere you go, all right.\n\n355\n00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,843\nSo er, actually you know we did apply it,\nwell let's see if it applies to me,\n\n356\n00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:02,946\nwe, [COUGH] I, I created the role, and\nI didn't specify, [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n357\n00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:06,499\nindividual users or anything like that,\nI, I just left it open.\n\n358\n00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,259\nYep.\n\n359\n00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:07,999\n[COUGH] Sorry.\n\n360\n00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:11,759\nAnd and so it, it should be applying\nyou know, pretty much everywhere.\n\n361\n00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,900\nSo so we can,\nwe can test it with [CROSSTALK].\n\n362\n00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,430\nYou know, just to be on the safe side.\n\n363\n00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,940\nI'm gonna log out and log back on.\n\n364\n00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,240\nAll right, so I'm just gonna log out and\nwe'll log back on.\n\n365\n00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,410\nOh, shoot I'm using hyper V and\n\n366\n00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,619\nthe adaptive screen resizing\ndoesn't work after you log out.\n\n367\n00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:49,359\nSo let me just reset that real quick.\n\n368\n00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,880\nThere we go.\n\n369\n00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,659\nAll right, so now that I'm I'm logged in.\n\n370\n00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:06,848\nIf I browse on my hard drive,\nand I go to my C drive, and\n\n371\n00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:11,790\nI go into CustomApp, and\nI run calc.exe, there we go.\n\n372\n00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,480\nYour system administrator\nhas blocked this program.\n\n373\n00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,370\nFor more information contact your\nsystem administrator, alright?\n\n374\n00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,271\nWe've effectively\nrestricted this software,\n\n375\n00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:23,469\nnow it's no longer able to execute.\n\n376\n00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,134\n>> Yeah, I,\nI like the message here, right Don,\n\n377\n00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:30,880\nbecause it doesn't give the user any\ndoubt that you have locked this out.\n\n378\n00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,700\nAnd so when they come and ask,\nI can't get in this and you go,\n\n379\n00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,480\nwell what did the message say?\n\n380\n00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,300\nNow it says see your system administrator.\n\n381\n00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,120\nIt says no, I blocked it on purpose.\n\n382\n00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,060\nYou know, when that message stinks though\nis when you are the system administrator.\n\n383\n00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,320\n>> Yeah, I know.\n>> And you're like great.\n\n384\n00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,265\nI gotta contact myself.\n\n385\n00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:48,860\n>> [LAUGH] Well.\n>> But here I'm, I'm just renaming my file\n\n386\n00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,970\nand the rename file calc2.exe,\nif I run it, if I try and run it.\n\n387\n00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,949\nOh, will it not run from the non?\n\n388\n00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:57,570\n>> It must.\n\n389\n00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,110\n>> Apparently not.\n\n390\n00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,435\nYeah, yeah.\n\n391\n00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:01,070\nI guess it doesn't work\nin another directory.\n\n392\n00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,890\nBut but yeah, so I tried to run it there.\n\n393\n00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,510\nIt's failing to run.\n\n394\n00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,430\nYou know something else we could just\ndo is we could try copying it to\n\n395\n00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,040\nanother location.\n\n396\n00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,750\n>> Yeah.\n\n397\n00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,570\n>> Like if I just copy\nit here to the C drive.\n\n398\n00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,160\nThere.\n\n399\n00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,610\nAnd I guess calculator won't\nrun from another folder.\n\n400\n00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,400\nBut interesting.\n\n401\n00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400\nWell you know, I could demonstrate it\nsimply by running the actual calculators.\n\n402\n00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,780\nThat's just located in the Windows folder.\n\n403\n00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,800\nIf I fire that up, there it goes,\nrunning just fine.\n\n404\n00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,400\nSo just keep that in mind,\nwith the path rules.\n\n405\n00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,430\nThey're the easiest.\n\n406\n00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> But\n\n407\n00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,390\nthey're also the easiest to bypass for\nan end user.\n\n408\n00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,480\nThey can kind of manipulate that.\n\n409\n00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,850\nIf it's a read only directory or something\nlike that, then that kind of solves that.\n\n410\n00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,440\nBut, they could copy the stuff\noff somewhere else and run it.\n\n411\n00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,470\nHash rules and certificate rules.\n\n412\n00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,880\n>> Yeah.\n\n413\n00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,690\n>> Hash rules just require constant\nmaintenance every time another version\n\n414\n00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,610\ncomes out.\n\n415\n00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,630\nCertificate rules are the best,\nbut not all software is signed and\n\n416\n00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,930\neven if it is signed,\nyou've gotta get the, the public key.\n\n417\n00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,140\nYou've got to get the certificate for\n\n418\n00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,530\nthat software in order to\ntie it into your policy.\n\n419\n00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,000\nNot every publisher's gonna,\ngonna give you that.\n\n420\n00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,790\nSo, so you'll have to keep that in mind.\n\n421\n00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,360\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right that's really about it for\n\n422\n00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,380\nsoftware restriction policies.\n\n423\n00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,490\nCan you think of anything else, Ronnie?\n\n424\n00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,740\n>> Not really, yeah.\n\n425\n00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,771\nBut we do have one other topic that\nactually is even more restrictive than\n\n426\n00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:17,700\nsoftware restriction policies.\n\n427\n00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,310\nAnd what we're talking about here is I,\nI don't wanna say it's a new concept, but\n\n428\n00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,171\nit's a newly renamed concept that's called\nassigned access, and this is, really for\n\n429\n00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:31,347\ncomputer that we might put in a particular\npublic location like a kiosk and allow\n\n430\n00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:35,860\npeople to, to just be able to interact\nwith the programs that we want them to.\n\n431\n00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,530\nSo usually it's,\n\n432\n00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,690\nit's a single app according to,\nto the way that they describe it.\n\n433\n00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,760\n>> Mm, yeah.\n\n434\n00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,240\nNow we've had this kiosk.\n\n435\n00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> Type functionality for\n\n436\n00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,990\na long time in windows [LAUGH] but in the\npast it always made it where when a user\n\n437\n00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,770\nlogged in you'd give them a really\nscaled down interface and\n\n438\n00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,335\naccess to a selection of apps.\n\n439\n00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:53,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n440\n00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,105\n>> In Windows 8, they've added support for\nthe Windows Store apps.\n\n441\n00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or the, the modern apps that we have.\n\n442\n00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,320\n>> Yeah.\n>> In the modern UI.\n\n443\n00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,450\nAnd that's really cool because you can\nbasically create a restricted user.\n\n444\n00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,070\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n445\n00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,320\nyou can specify exactly which\napps you want them to run.\n\n446\n00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,460\nAnd they can be traditional, legacy apps.\n\n447\n00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,049\nYou know, things that are desktop apps.\n\n448\n00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,600\nBut the idea is that you use Metroapp.\n\n449\n00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,179\nNope.\nNo.\n\n450\n00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:17,099\nModern UI.\n\n451\n00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,139\n>> Modern UI.\n\n452\n00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:21,335\n>> Stupid terminology, so a,\nso the modern UI apps and, and\n\n453\n00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:25,772\ntheir gonna be nice full screen rendered\nand if their locked into just that app you\n\n454\n00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:30,360\ncan have a computer that basically fires\nup, goes into one program and that's it.\n\n455\n00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,260\n>> That's it.\n>> They don't have access to\n\n456\n00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,210\nanything else.\n\n457\n00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:32,945\nVery, very useful.\n\n458\n00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:33,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n459\n00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,430\nSo so I want to show an example\nhere on this Windows 8 machine.\n\n460\n00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,225\nAnd I had to pick an app before the show.\n\n461\n00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:40,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, and I thought of one.\n\n462\n00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,290\nJust trying to come up\nwith a real case scenario.\n\n463\n00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,310\nI, I use a program called Plex.\n\n464\n00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,690\nIt's a media server.\n\n465\n00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,405\nAnd I use it.\n\n466\n00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Darn near every day, right?\n\n467\n00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,290\nThat's pretty much how we watch\nTV in my house is with Plex.\n\n468\n00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,229\nAnd and it's a little media manager app\nthat you launch and you can have all your\n\n469\n00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:58,730\nmovies and stuff catalogued in there and\nyou can browse them and click it.\n\n470\n00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,955\nWell, what if you have a Windows\n8 tablet or something, and\n\n471\n00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,989\nyou want your kids to be able to use it?\n\n472\n00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,549\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n473\n00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:07,060\nyou want them to be able to fire\nup this app and get into Plex so\n\n474\n00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,640\nthey can watch shows, but you don't\nwant them to get into anything else.\n\n475\n00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,830\nWell, you can create one of these access,\nor, you know, limited access accounts.\n\n476\n00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,290\nAnd restrict what all they can get to and\nlimit it down to just Plex in this case.\n\n477\n00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,510\nSo, so let me show you here.\n\n478\n00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,190\nWe'll fire this up.\n\n479\n00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,240\nSo here's, here's my,\nmy normal desktop and when I fire up my,\n\n480\n00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,300\nmy start screen I've got al\nthe various apps that are here.\n\n481\n00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,480\nYou know so I can go into\nInternet Explorer, or Skype or whatever.\n\n482\n00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,197\nAnd I, I've got my Plex here if I fire\nthat up you know it will connect up to my\n\n483\n00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:39,790\nlittle media server and and\n\n484\n00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,809\nbe ready to go and it's overrun by\nchildren's movies because I have two kids.\n\n485\n00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:48,250\nSo but anyhow we can get in there and\nwe can watch Plex, yay.\n\n486\n00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,710\n>> Brave Little Toaster, I want that.\n\n487\n00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,950\n>> Brave Little Toaster,\nthat movie's awesome.\n\n488\n00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:57,190\nSo so anyhow so if I want to create\na restricted account for my child right?\n\n489\n00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,353\nWe can go into our user accounts and so\n\n490\n00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:05,469\nI'm just gonna go here to\nUser Accounts in Windows 8.\n\n491\n00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,489\nAnd, wait this is the wrong screen.\n\n492\n00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:10,250\n>> You wanna go through the hm.\n\n493\n00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,750\nThere you go.\n>> There we go.\n\n494\n00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,310\nYou'll work out.\n\n495\n00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,970\n>> You'll work out.\n\n496\n00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,369\n>> All right.\nSo, so I've got, well, that's my account.\n\n497\n00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:22,489\nLet's go here.\n\n498\n00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:25,949\nSo, or actually,\n>> No, you have to go into accounts.\n\n499\n00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:27,129\nYeah.\n>> I was in the right spot.\n\n500\n00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:27,629\nOkay.\n\n501\n00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,250\nSo, so here I've got, like, my account.\n\n502\n00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,490\nI, I don't want to mess with my account,\nthough.\n\n503\n00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:37,250\nI want to create a new account and\nI need to activate my other account?\n\n504\n00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,770\nThere we go!\n\n505\n00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,662\n>> Yep.\n>> Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n506\n00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:42,539\nSo so here under other accounts\nwe can add in our other accounts.\n\n507\n00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:46,150\nSo we would create an account,\nlike for our child or whatever.\n\n508\n00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,242\nAnd then notice this.\n\n509\n00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:50,426\nSet up an account for assigned access.\n\n510\n00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:53,213\nAnd assigned access, that's the restricted\naccess that we're talking about.\n\n511\n00:23:53,213 --> 00:23:53,846\nAnd so,\n\n512\n00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:59,645\nif I chose that we can pick what access\nwe want to restrict that account to be.\n\n513\n00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:04,000\nI pick the account that I'm restricting,\nand then I pick the app or apps.\n\n514\n00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,680\n>> Right.\n>> That I want them to access.\n\n515\n00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,260\nAll right.\n\n516\n00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,580\n>> Now, let me go back here.\n\n517\n00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,790\nSo we'll create an account.\n\n518\n00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,900\nAnd so I'm gonna create, let's see.\n\n519\n00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,660\nI want to add a child's account.\n\n520\n00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,050\nChild's email address.\n\n521\n00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,330\nHere, add a child's account without email\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n522\n00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,750\n>> Yeah because we definitely want our\n\n523\n00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,870\nkids to have an email account, right?\n\n524\n00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,810\nSo I'll create an account here, John Doe\nand you know, we can set a password.\n\n525\n00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,333\nI'll just make it something simple.\n\n526\n00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:38,624\n[SOUND] I hate that you have to\nhave a password hint, you know.\n\n527\n00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:44,290\nYour password didn't connect,\n\n528\n00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,925\nyou need, oh.\n\n529\n00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,666\n[LAUGH] Alright, there.\n\n530\n00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How [INAUDIBLE] does it?\n\n531\n00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,460\nIt's a kid's account, and I got to meet\npassword complexity, are you kidding me?\n\n532\n00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,619\nAlright, well let me just.\n\n533\n00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,940\nSet up a password for your kid.\n\n534\n00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,795\nInsert blood sample.\n\n535\n00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:01,180\n[LAUGH] Insert social security number.\n\n536\n00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,500\nAlright some of these\nrequirements are a little crazy.\n\n537\n00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,410\nAlright so so there we go.\n\n538\n00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,780\nSo I created an account, John Doe and\nI'll just say set up an account for\n\n539\n00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,400\nassigned access and\nI'm gonna pick that John Doe account.\n\n540\n00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,250\nSo there we go, I got John Doe.\n\n541\n00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,660\nAnd now I can choose the apps, and\nthis account has no apps installed,\n\n542\n00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,380\nat least one app on the selected account,\noh.\n\n543\n00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,720\nSo, [LAUGH], our metro-- metro,\nour modern UI apps if you login to\n\n544\n00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,060\nthe store and you access apps from there,\nit's tied to your Microsoft account.\n\n545\n00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,570\n>> Yea\n>> Right.\n\n546\n00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,500\nWell my user account, the,\nthe Don Pazet account,\n\n547\n00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,160\nwell, that one is tied to my Microsoft\naccount and I've got my Plex app that I,\n\n548\n00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,830\nI purchased from the Windows store,\nyou know, so it's there.\n\n549\n00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,330\nBut this is an all-new account that's not\nlinked to a Microsoft account at all, so\n\n550\n00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,660\nit doesn't have store access yet.\n\n551\n00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,390\nSo when I go to choose an app,\nI can't pick anything, even,\n\n552\n00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:58,420\neven local, you know,\nlocal installed default installed apps.\n\n553\n00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,020\nAnd I think that changes if we,\nif we just log in as the user once.\n\n554\n00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,070\nAnd I'm pretty sure I can't assign myself\nsince I am logged in, but you know what,\n\n555\n00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:16,040\nI bet if we logged in as someone else we\nprobably could so let's give that a shot.\n\n556\n00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,360\nSee I'm, I'm and administrator so\n\n557\n00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,920\nI don't think you can do restricted\naccess like you know, for me.\n\n558\n00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,360\nBut, oh and on, on the domain account.\n\n559\n00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,040\nYou can't do it for domain accounts,\nit has to be a local account.\n\n560\n00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,420\nSo, let's see,\nwhat's going to be the best way.\n\n561\n00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,920\nLet me, let me sign in as the new account,\n\n562\n00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,980\nthen we'll see if that\ntakes care of it for us.\n\n563\n00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,770\nIf not, we would have to link\nit to a Microsoft account.\n\n564\n00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,340\nBut the, but the end game,\nthe end result, assuming it works is that\n\n565\n00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,450\nwe are able to,\nlet me just log in as John.\n\n566\n00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,560\nIs that we're able to\nbasically pick those apps.\n\n567\n00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,480\nAnd when they launch on Windows 8,\nthey'll get the start screen and they'll\n\n568\n00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,790\njust have that one app or those couple\nof apps that we specified and that's it.\n\n569\n00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:04,580\nIt's perfect for kiosks or\ntablets that you're giving to, you know,\n\n570\n00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,640\nlab students or\nyour own children or whatever.\n\n571\n00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,650\nAnd you basically filter that view down.\n\n572\n00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,665\nWhich I would love to show.\n\n573\n00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:15,540\n>> [LAUGH] They're\ngenerating your profile.\n\n574\n00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,080\n>> Hey look,\nI can get new apps from the store.\n\n575\n00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,480\n[LAUGH]\nWell you know,\n\n576\n00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,390\nlet's do this, Ronnie cause it can take\na while for the new account to set up, and\n\n577\n00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,850\nif I have to link it to my Microsoft\naccount I will, but let's do this,\n\n578\n00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,600\nlet's take a TV time out.\n\n579\n00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,550\n>> Okay\n>> While,\n\n580\n00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,090\nwhile this thing runs and as soon as\nit's done we'll just pick back up.\n\n581\n00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,110\n>> Yeah.\n>> So if you're watching this live\n\n582\n00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,020\njust give us a few minutes and-,\nand we'll get in there.\n\n583\n00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,610\nIf you're watching this\nrecorded we'll be back in\n\n584\n00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,580\na flash\n>> Right\n\n585\n00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,670\n>> And, and we'll get a chance to see what\n\n586\n00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,090\nthat assigned access looks like\nwhen it's applied to an account.\n\n587\n00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,190\n>> Yep, right.\n>> So, stay tuned and\n\n588\n00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,084\nwe'll be back in just a minute.\n\n589\n00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:58,682\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n590\n00:27:58,682 --> 00:28:02,860\nThanks to the magic of TV, only seconds\nhave passed since we took our break.\n\n591\n00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,830\n[LAUGH] During that time we,\nwe logged in as a John Doe user so\n\n592\n00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,940\nthat his profile got created and\nwe rebooted the machine.\n\n593\n00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,470\n>> Right.\n\n594\n00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,360\n>> The assigned access does require\na reboot once you turn it on.\n\n595\n00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,260\nThe the cool part is that now that it's in\n\n596\n00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,820\nplace-\n>> Yep.\n\n597\n00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,050\n>> We can, we can actually configure it.\n\n598\n00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,220\nSo, so here I am back on that screen\nwith our, our user account and\n\n599\n00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,180\nwe can choose that set up an account for\nassigned access.\n\n600\n00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,155\nAnd now because John Doe has his\nuser profile, we can pick his apps.\n\n601\n00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:31,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, now I,\n\n602\n00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,890\nI originally was going to pick the plex\napp but that's tied to my Microsoft.\n\n603\n00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> Account and\n\n604\n00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,400\nJohn Doe's got his own account so, so\nI just picked out a built in Windows app.\n\n605\n00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,925\nI picked Windows Calculator A.\n\n606\n00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:42,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> In this case, all right.\n\n607\n00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,680\nSo now John Doe is restricted in\n\n608\n00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,320\nkiosk mode just to be able to\nrun the windows calculator.\n\n609\n00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,465\nNot the regular windows calculator but the\nnew modern UI calculator so it's fancy.\n\n610\n00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,600\n>> Fancy.\n\n611\n00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,062\n>> Alright so I'm going to go ahead and\nlog out and I will,\n\n612\n00:28:58,062 --> 00:29:03,470\nwill switch over to old John there and\nyou know, I wanna log out but\n\n613\n00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:09,650\nthat crazy Windows [LAUGH] tour\nbutton is gonna get in my way.\n\n614\n00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,210\nOh you know it does this, doesn't it?\n\n615\n00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:13,710\nSo.\n\n616\n00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,520\n>> There you go, you're back.\n\n617\n00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,660\n>> Well no.\nYou know I'm in menu that little\n\n618\n00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,630\ntour thing is really does\njust love to stay up there.\n\n619\n00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,440\n>> Go to the settings.\n\n620\n00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,910\nYep.\nThere we go.\n\n621\n00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,540\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n622\n00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,300\nSneak around it.\n\n623\n00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,110\n>> There we go.\n\n624\n00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,600\n>> All right.\nSo I'm going to go ahead and sign out.\n\n625\n00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,170\nAnd now, once I sign out, I'm going to\ngo ahead and just sign in as John Doe.\n\n626\n00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,130\nSo you know, you wouldn't give\nthe other passwords to the user.\n\n627\n00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,780\nThey would just have their one account,\nJohn Doe.\n\n628\n00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,680\nSo you're gonna log in.\n\n629\n00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,820\nIf I can remember his password.\n\n630\n00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,250\nAnd when John Doe logs in,\n\n631\n00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,140\nhe is going to get thrown right in-\n>> To the biggest calculator\n\n632\n00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,660\nhe's ever seen.\n\n633\n00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,442\n>> Right, the-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n634\n00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:59,120\n>> [COUGH] The modern UI,\n\n635\n00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,910\nnice full screen calculator.\n\n636\n00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,160\nThere it is.\n\n637\n00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,010\nHe's got that access.\n\n638\n00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,065\nNow, the cool thing here is he\nis restricted to just this app.\n\n639\n00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:07,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n640\n00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,950\nif he presses the Windows key\nto pull of the start menu.\n\n641\n00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,700\nWhat happens?\n\n642\n00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,480\n>> Doesn't work.\n\n643\n00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,785\n>> Nothing, and if he closes\nthis app if he does like Alt F4.\n\n644\n00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:17,950\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Nothing right.\n\n645\n00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,860\nSo he is locked into this\nmodern UI app and that is it.\n\n646\n00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,200\nHe is able to operate in it.\n\n647\n00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,050\nIt's locked full screen.\n\n648\n00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,360\nIt's there.\n\n649\n00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,425\nThis is, is what he's in.\n\n650\n00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:28,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n651\n00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,510\n>> And now, he's trapped.\n\n652\n00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,100\n>> Yeah.\nHow does he sign out, Don?\n\n653\n00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,110\n>> You don't!\n\n654\n00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,520\nWhy would you want to\nsign out of a calculator?\n\n655\n00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,663\n>> Yeah, why would you ever sign out?\n\n656\n00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:36,985\n[LAUGH]\n>> I mean look, you got,\n\n657\n00:30:36,985 --> 00:30:41,459\nyou got nine plus nine they, they got you\n>> Oh [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n658\n00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,780\n>> So so alright, so\n\n659\n00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,585\nnine plus nine might be a little\nmore that what I thought.\n\n660\n00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,178\nHere seven times 8, the,\n\n661\n00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:49,890\nthe mystery of the world is\n>> Oh.\n\n662\n00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,612\n>> Quadrillion.\n\n663\n00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:53,122\nWhat is going on with this calculator?\n\n664\n00:30:54,342 --> 00:30:59,752\n>> I think the calculator is experiencing\nsome technical difficulties.\n\n665\n00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:02,272\n>> I think I've got a stuck\nkey on my keyboard.\n\n666\n00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:02,924\nSo 7 x 8 = 56.\n\n667\n00:31:02,924 --> 00:31:05,206\nThere we go,\nall my education was not for naught.\n\n668\n00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:07,752\nSo so anyhow, how,\nhow do we get out of this?\n\n669\n00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:09,382\nOld John Doe calls you up and says \"Hey,\n\n670\n00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:12,090\nI'm having some problems,\ncan you come troubleshoot my computer?\"\n\n671\n00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,410\nWell you know aside from bad math you\ncan't really troubleshoot at all right?\n\n672\n00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,340\nThe secret sauce here\nit's the Windows key.\n\n673\n00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,250\n>> Windows Key\n>> Now when he presses the Windows key,\n\n674\n00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,840\nnothing happens right?\n\n675\n00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,480\nBut as an administrator who knows better,\n\n676\n00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,360\nyou walk up you press\nthe Windows key five times.\n\n677\n00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,550\n>> Five Times.\n\n678\n00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,281\n>> Yep, so one, two, three, four, five.\n\n679\n00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:33,581\nAnd, what are you going to do.\n\n680\n00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:36,323\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] Alright, I definitely\nhave stuck key on my keyboard.\n\n681\n00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:39,600\nLet me just try that again.\n\n682\n00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,370\nAlright.\nOne, two, three, four, five.\n\n683\n00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:42,945\nThere we go!\n\n684\n00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,195\nI was gonna say-\n>> All right.\n\n685\n00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,017\n>> I know it works.\n\n686\n00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:45,529\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n687\n00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,175\n>> When you press the Windows key\n\n688\n00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:49,835\nfive times,\nit takes you back to your desktop,\n\n689\n00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:52,315\nwhere you can now sign in as yourself-\n>> Right.\n\n690\n00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:54,205\n>> And you're not assigned access,\nyou can get in and\n\n691\n00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:56,045\ndo whatever you need to troubleshoot.\n\n692\n00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,405\nThen sign out.\n\n693\n00:31:57,405 --> 00:32:01,105\nWhen John signs back in,\nit'll be back to restricted access.\n\n694\n00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:02,420\n>> There we go.\n\n695\n00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,250\nAlright.\n\n696\n00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,530\nSo, couple of caveats\nabout assigned access.\n\n697\n00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,105\nNumber one,\nit does need to be a local user account.\n\n698\n00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:11,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It doesn't work with domain accounts.\n\n699\n00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,150\nNumber two, you, you need to reboot after.\n\n700\n00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,656\n>> Right.\n>> Turns on.\n\n701\n00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:16,727\n[LAUGH] Ronnie, thank you for\nteaching me that.\n\n702\n00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,965\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I saw it at the last moment.\n\n703\n00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:20,695\nI was like, hey, that's,\nthat's reboot,you know?\n\n704\n00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:24,944\n>> Number, number three, you can limit\nthem to modern UI apps, [CROSSTALK] right,\n\n705\n00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,903\nnot, you know, not our desktop apps.\n\n706\n00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:27,978\nAnd number four,\n\n707\n00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:31,855\nit is tied to the Microsoft\naccount if they're purchased apps.\n\n708\n00:32:31,855 --> 00:32:33,005\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, if it's built in apps,\n\n709\n00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:35,245\nthat's one thing, but\nif it's purchased apps, you know,\n\n710\n00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,960\nit would need to be tied\nto a Microsoft account.\n\n711\n00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,800\nThe exception would be if you\nside loaded enterprise apps and\n\n712\n00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,880\none's you've developed internally\nyou can tie them to those too.\n\n713\n00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,080\nSo couple restrictions to assigned access,\nit's neat I'm sure it's a feature we'll\n\n714\n00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,100\nsee to continue to evolve\n>> Right\n\n715\n00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,620\n>> But in it's current state it it does\n\n716\n00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,060\nserve as pointless so.\n\n717\n00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,490\nAlright so\nI think that's about it Ronnie for.\n\n718\n00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,950\n>> That's about as\nrestrictive as we can get.\n\n719\n00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,770\n>> Yeah our software restriction\npolicies and our assigned access.\n\n720\n00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,710\nTwo great new features.\n\n721\n00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,090\n>> Right.\n>> Of Windows 8.1 because they are kind of\n\n722\n00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,810\nnewer you know, and, and fancy, Microsoft\ndoes love to put them on the exam,\n\n723\n00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,950\nthat's why we wanted to film\n>> Right.\n\n724\n00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,200\n>> This segment.\n\n725\n00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,420\nAlright, I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n726\n00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,340\nWe'll see you in the next special.\n\n727\n00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,470\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16,875\nToday, we're picking up on some of the new\nobjectives that were added in January 2014\n\n4\n00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,730\nas Microsoft refreshed the exam for\nWindows 8.1.\n\n5\n00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,510\nNow, as most of you guys know,\n\n6\n00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,940\nwe filmed all of our episodes in Windows\n8.1, cause we knew the change was coming.\n\n7\n00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,480\n>> Right.\n\n8\n00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,470\n>> But they still caught us by surprise by\nadding in a few extra little objectives,\n\n9\n00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,180\nand so we're filming specials like\nthese to make sure that we cover all\n\n10\n00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,880\nthe topics that you might see\nwhen you go to sit that exam.\n\n11\n00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,530\nIn this special, we're going to be taking\na look at Internet Explorer 11 and, and\n\n12\n00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,610\nmore particularly just some\nof the little features and,\n\n13\n00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,200\nand settings that we need to be aware of.\n\n14\n00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,265\nThese aren't particularly new features.\n\n15\n00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:49,140\n>> Right.\n>> But they're just ones that Microsoft\n\n16\n00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,220\nwants to accentuate because they,\nthey know that these are things that\n\n17\n00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,260\na typical IT support person is\ngoing to have to deal with.\n\n18\n00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,900\n>> Yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,500\nThe browser is one of our most important\napplications that we run on our desktop.\n\n20\n00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,560\nIt does help a regular\nbusiness user to connect to\n\n21\n00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,770\npartner websites when they need to,\nto make orders when they need to.\n\n22\n00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,880\nAnd so this particular application\nof being able to customize it,\n\n23\n00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,750\nmake it function the way that we want\nin our organizations is important.\n\n24\n00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,080\nAnd there's a lot of additional\nthings that we can do to it,\n\n25\n00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,590\nto help customize it.\n\n26\n00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,310\n>> Yep.\n\n27\n00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,225\nOne of the main things that we\nwant to take a look at is well,\n\n28\n00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:22,330\nyou know,\nthere are a few different things.\n\n29\n00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,024\nThere's are a lot of neat little\nfeatures that are built into IE11 that,\n\n30\n00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:26,270\nthat are kind of neat.\n\n31\n00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,570\nProbably one of the, the bigger things,\nis the modern UI integration.\n\n32\n00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,080\n>> Right.\n\n33\n00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,670\n>> So, in Windows 8, and Windows 8.1,\n\n34\n00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,340\nInternet Explorer 11 not only has Desktop\nmode, which is kind of what we're used to.\n\n35\n00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,750\nBut we also now have a modern UI mode.\n\n36\n00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,770\nAnd, and basically it just gives us some,\nsome different kind of,\n\n37\n00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,510\nkind layouts of what we have, right?\n\n38\n00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,823\nSo the desktop mode is what I use.\n\n39\n00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,037\n>> Yep.\n>> 99% of the time, cause,\n\n40\n00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:51,963\nyou know, whatever.\n\n41\n00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:54,950\nBut so you know,\nyou run it here on your desktop.\n\n42\n00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,790\nYou've got it down here in\nyour taskbar right here.\n\n43\n00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,645\nAnd each tab that you have open renders a\nseparate preview button you know kind of,\n\n44\n00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:02,850\nkind of nice to have.\n\n45\n00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,170\nThe modern UI mode, though, if we got\nback to our modern UI you will have\n\n46\n00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,610\nan Internet Explorer button, and when you\nhit that it is going to fire up in a full\n\n47\n00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,670\nscreen touch optimized layout and\nif you have got a touch screen and\n\n48\n00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,220\nmy, my laptop is a touch screen\nit can be Somewhat handy.\n\n49\n00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,970\nThere's some, some kind of big\nlimitations on this one, though.\n\n50\n00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,430\nWhen you're in the, the modern UI, when\nyou're in this full screen tablet type\n\n51\n00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,310\nmode, there's a lot of plug\nins that are not supported.\n\n52\n00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,290\nThings like Java and\nFlash don't quite work.\n\n53\n00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,370\nNow it is fully HTML5 compatible,\nso a lot of newer sites,\n\n54\n00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,800\nlike, like if we take you know,\n\n55\n00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,778\nsince it's a touch screen, I should use my\non screen keyboard and stuff, to do this.\n\n56\n00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:50,900\nSo, but you, you know I say I'm going\nto do it, and then I don't do it.\n\n57\n00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,780\nSo, so here we go.\n\n58\n00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,120\nSo if I go to old YouTube.com for example,\nYouTube used to be rendered almost\n\n59\n00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,140\nentirely in Flash, but Google has\nmade a big push to go HTML 5 and so\n\n60\n00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,560\nyou'll see that all of these videos in\nhere are, you know, are available and,\n\n61\n00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,060\nand you know, we can watch them and\nstuff without having a flash plug in.\n\n62\n00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,710\nCause it is rendering in HTML 5.\n\n63\n00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,710\n>> There you go.\n\n64\n00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,445\n>> That's,\nA pretty interesting video I suppose.\n\n65\n00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:17,494\n>> [laughs]\n>> But\n\n66\n00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:22,460\nthere's other site you can go to\nthat maybe require Java, and, and\n\n67\n00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,830\nthose are, are not gonna work so\nwell for us, right?\n\n68\n00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,319\nSo, so if I go to.\n\n69\n00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,450\nLet's do a, a quick test, Java test.\n\n70\n00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,750\nSo here, I'll try and\nfire up a test applet.\n\n71\n00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,820\nAnd you know, when we go here we can\nchoose to verify our Java version.\n\n72\n00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,920\nAnd it just kind of sits here, and\n\n73\n00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,050\nthat's because Java isn't installed\nin this modern UI browser.\n\n74\n00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,514\nSo keep in mind that there's really two\ndifferent internet explorer elevens.\n\n75\n00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:54,765\nThe desktop app and the modern UI app.\n\n76\n00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,472\nAnd the modern UI app is\na little more limited.\n\n77\n00:03:56,472 --> 00:04:00,170\n>> Yeah, and you see right here where even\nthough the limitations there at the bottom\n\n78\n00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,360\nof the screen,\nwhere it says hey If you want to try and\n\n79\n00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,930\ndo this you have to go to the desktop.\n\n80\n00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,130\nInternet Explorer 11 icon\nto to be able to do that.\n\n81\n00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,740\n>> Yep.\n\n82\n00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,400\nAnd if we flip over to the desktop one,\nwell,\n\n83\n00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,040\nthe desktop one does have java support.\n\n84\n00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,050\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you've installed java.\n\n85\n00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,768\n>> Right.\n>> And its got flash and things,\n\n86\n00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,711\nand so you can go in here, and,\nand run it and off you go,\n\n87\n00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:21,760\nand I think I've made no secret around\nhere about how little I care for Java.\n\n88\n00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,704\n>> You love it.\n>> So, [LAUGH] so\n\n89\n00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:24,850\nI don't necessarily miss it-\n>> Warm fuzzies.\n\n90\n00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,625\n>> But but flash is something that\nI still use pretty frequently,\n\n91\n00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,915\nso, you hate to lose that one.\n\n92\n00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,235\n>> Yep.\n\n93\n00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:32,535\n>> All right, what are, what are some\nof the other settings that we need to,\n\n94\n00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:33,235\nto take a look at?\n\n95\n00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:35,295\nYou know, Microsoft calls some\nstuff out in the objectives.\n\n96\n00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:39,075\n>> You know, it's gonna be the Internet\nExplorer options that is pretty much the,\n\n97\n00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:42,245\nthe big one that we had, if you take\na look in the upper right hand corner,\n\n98\n00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:43,495\nwe have the gear and\n\n99\n00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:46,065\nthen those Internet Explorer options\nthere that have been around for.\n\n100\n00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,380\nJon how long have these\nthings been around?\n\n101\n00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,170\n>> Forever, man.\n\n102\n00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,690\n>> I mean forever and a day.\n\n103\n00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,454\nAnd so getting familiar and, and\nunderstanding what's on these tabs\n\n104\n00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:58,087\nare going to be very important for\nus on the exam.\n\n105\n00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:02,250\nSo this first page again sets up where we\ncan launch a bigger homepage for us so\n\n106\n00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,517\nthat it actually opens up directly\nto where we want it to be.\n\n107\n00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:08,130\nNow you might go,\nwell do I really care about that?\n\n108\n00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,036\nWell, in a business you may, right?\n\n109\n00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,690\nYou want to actually make sure it opens up\nto the webpage you want it to open up to\n\n110\n00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,420\nand not to someone's Facebook account you\nknow, something like that automatically.\n\n111\n00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,408\nAnd so, so\nhere's something we can do right here.\n\n112\n00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:22,805\n>> And, you know, one feature that is kind\nof nice is we have a tabbed web browser,\n\n113\n00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,420\nand so you can actually set\nmore than one homepage.\n\n114\n00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,570\nIf you want you can just list\nthem all right there And\n\n115\n00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,560\nwhen you open up Internet Explorer it\nwill automatically open those tabs.\n\n116\n00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,889\nThat's kind of convenient.\n\n117\n00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,586\nIt can slow things down though when you\nlaunch it if its got to fire up all\n\n118\n00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:36,580\nthese different tabs, so\nI, I tend not to do that.\n\n119\n00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,761\nI usually just use Google as my home\npage which I am sure Microsoft loves, So\n\n120\n00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,003\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n121\n00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:42,870\n>> So, you know, those are some\nof the basic settings there.\n\n122\n00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,247\nThe rest of this stuff is,\nis pretty much the same.\n\n123\n00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:48,771\nThere are some tab settings that we can go\nmodify those that have been the same since\n\n124\n00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:51,040\nIE seven when tabs were introduced.\n\n125\n00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,550\nYou can delete your browsing history.\n\n126\n00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,750\nYou know, these are really not new,\nor, or even exciting, but, but\n\n127\n00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,330\nin the tab views where\nyou can manipulate like\n\n128\n00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,142\ndo we want pop ups to show up in a tab or\nin a separate window, things like that.\n\n129\n00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:08,470\nYou know, where do you want to\nopen links and, and other things.\n\n130\n00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,902\nThese are just useful like\nusability changes, and, and\n\n131\n00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:13,903\nyou can kind of browse through these\non your own computer and see them.\n\n132\n00:06:13,903 --> 00:06:16,202\nThe, the majority of them are very,\nvery self explanatory.\n\n133\n00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:17,275\n>> Yep, Now Don I don't,\n\n134\n00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:20,242\nI don't really take a look at\nthe appearance buttons down there.\n\n135\n00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:22,820\nAre, are those, well what,\nwhat would you use that for?\n\n136\n00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,282\nI-\n>> Well, you know you really wouldnt\n\n137\n00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:25,062\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:06:25,062 --> 00:06:26,949\n>> And so if yeah if if you're a web\n\n139\n00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:31,451\ndeveloper you can set things on a web\npage that can control like for links,\n\n140\n00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:32,795\nwhat color they are.\n\n141\n00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:34,750\n>> Mm-hm. Nice. >> And\nif you've all ready visited the link,\n\n142\n00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,050\nwhat color it is and stuff.\n\n143\n00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,180\nThe web developers,\n\n144\n00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,840\nwhen they create those web pages,\nthey can actually define that in the page.\n\n145\n00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,290\n>> Yeah.\n>> This gives you the chance to\n\n146\n00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,940\noverride a lot of that.\n\n147\n00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,230\nThe default language that you render your\npages in, the fonts that are being used,\n\n148\n00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,010\nthe colors of,\nof things like links and, and so on.\n\n149\n00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,940\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you it's got the text,\n\n150\n00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,600\nbackground, visited, unvisited.\n\n151\n00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,200\nSo we can override some of that stuff.\n\n152\n00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,740\nAnd it's really designed for\nthis right here.\n\n153\n00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,710\n>> Accessibility.\n>> Accessibility.\n\n154\n00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,910\nYeah.\n>> If you've got poor vision, you know,\n\n155\n00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,810\neyesight, whatever, you might\nwant to default to a larger font.\n\n156\n00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,685\nYou might not want to use some of\nthe crazy goofy fonts the sites use.\n\n157\n00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,855\nAnd so you might choose to\noverride it here and pick some,\n\n158\n00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:13,165\nsome default font to to just kind of beat\nout what's being used on the browsers.\n\n159\n00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As we get screens that are higher and\n\n160\n00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,130\nhigher resolution, a lot of times\nit becomes difficult to read text.\n\n161\n00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,950\nNow-\n>> Yeah.\n\n162\n00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,665\n>> If you're on a touch screen, you know,\nyou, you probably have pinch to zoom.\n\n163\n00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:24,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which is pretty handy.\n\n164\n00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,270\nIf you're not on a touch screen,\nyou can just go up here to your Gear icon.\n\n165\n00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,320\n>> Zoom.\n>> And you've got the zoom capability, and\n\n166\n00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,240\nyou can adjust it there.\n\n167\n00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,270\nAnd in fact, you know,\n\n168\n00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,830\nwhen you do the pinch to zoom,\nnotice how that zoom stays 100%.\n\n169\n00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,970\nSo it's actually not effecting that.\n\n170\n00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,730\nSo it is two different things that are,\nthat are in play.\n\n171\n00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,390\nBut now that i set it to 150,\nI can't zoom out any further than that.\n\n172\n00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,730\nSo so you know you've got that,\nthat capability there, and that's useful.\n\n173\n00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,200\n>> If you have a monitor\nthat's 1920 by 1080-\n\n174\n00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,184\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n175\n00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:54,729\n>> Which is pretty common now,\nit's hard to read the text.\n\n176\n00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,329\nIt always gets rendered so small now.\n\n177\n00:07:57,329 --> 00:07:59,732\nSo so\nthat can really help with that usability.\n\n178\n00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:00,428\nYeah.\n\n179\n00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:05,838\nAll right, some of the other settings just\nto kind of, kinda breeze through them.\n\n180\n00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,828\nThe security tab here is nice cuz\n>> Right.\n\n181\n00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:12,230\n>> this is where we can set how restricted\nwe want the access for webpages to be.\n\n182\n00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,141\nThere's four zones: internet,\nlocal intranet, trusted sites, and\n\n183\n00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,452\nrestricted sites.\n\n184\n00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:20,487\nInternet, that's just your general\nwebpages that are out there on\n\n185\n00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:21,510\nthe internet.\n\n186\n00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,440\nYou don't normally trust them very much\nbecause you can get drive by malware\n\n187\n00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,170\ninstalls and so on.\n\n188\n00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,054\nLocal intranet though those are going\nto be your local servers in a business\n\n189\n00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:35,125\nenvironment and you normally do trust\nthem so you allow applications to run and\n\n190\n00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,069\nsimilar things.\n\n191\n00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:37,293\n>> Yeah.\n>> Trusted sites are,\n\n192\n00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:41,212\nare not necessarily work computers but\nthey are computers that you have extensive\n\n193\n00:08:41,212 --> 00:08:41,968\ntrust for\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n194\n00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:44,860\n>> that you will allow them\nto do whatever they need.\n\n195\n00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,987\nAnd so this would be, you know, whatever\nyour corporate assets are, your home\n\n196\n00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:52,250\nmachines, whatever you might list in here,\nto ensure that they can, can run properly.\n\n197\n00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,680\nAnd the restricted sites are sites\nthat you absolutely do not trust.\n\n198\n00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,590\nYou will only allow them to do basic\nrendering, and, and that's it.\n\n199\n00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,206\nAnd this can significantly affect pages.\n\n200\n00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:04,878\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you go to a page like let's see,\n\n201\n00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,130\nwho can we mess with.\n\n202\n00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,180\nIf we go to like, let's go to CNN.\n\n203\n00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,790\nCNN's home page is a mess.\n\n204\n00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,000\nSo CNN, you know that, it's a news site\nhere in the United States if you're\n\n205\n00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,670\na international viewer or whatever.\n\n206\n00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,740\nYou might not ever go here.\n\n207\n00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,730\nThey're deemed as one of the more\nreputable news sources in the US,\n\n208\n00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,030\nalthough I debate that.\n\n209\n00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,310\nAnd when you look at their home page,\nyou'll notice like all ads over here.\n\n210\n00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> Ads over here.\n\n211\n00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,850\n>> All over the place.\n\n212\n00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,720\n>> Ads here, ads here.\n\n213\n00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,800\nSo, you know, easily 50% of this page\nis advertisements, you know, and, and\n\n214\n00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,520\nreally there's only one news article on\nthe immediate view of their homepage.\n\n215\n00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,120\nFor a news site that's pretty bad.\n\n216\n00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,870\nSo so anyhow, their site is rendering\ncontent from all over the place,\n\n217\n00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,000\ndoing all sorts of things, right?\n\n218\n00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,670\nWell, if I go here,\ninto my internet options, and\n\n219\n00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,550\nsecurity, and\nI go to restricted sites, all right?\n\n220\n00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,280\nI can come in here, and I can designate,\n\n221\n00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,810\nI'm just gonna go in here and\nput www.star.cnn.com.\n\n222\n00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,460\nI'm gonna add CNN to my restricted sites.\n\n223\n00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,840\nSo, whenever I go to any\nwww.cnn.com website, that,\n\n224\n00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,020\nthat's why I put that star in there,\nasterisk.\n\n225\n00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> It means anything www.cnn.com,\n\n226\n00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,220\nwhen I go to that website it's going\nto ensure that no scripts are allowed\n\n227\n00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,720\nto run and, and special things like that,\nthat could lead to possible compromises.\n\n228\n00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,220\nAnd so now if I go to CNN.com now it's\n\n229\n00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,200\nin my restricted zone and\nwhat we'll see is that certain aspects\n\n230\n00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,495\nof the page are now going to be broken\nall right, and some of it in a good way.\n\n231\n00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:41,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> Notice how all the ads disappeared.\n\n232\n00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,380\nThe ads were being rendered with scripts\nthat were pulling data from other servers.\n\n233\n00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,330\nAnd there's several security exploits\nthat could take advantage of that.\n\n234\n00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,111\nThey call it cross domain scripting,\n>> Yeah.\n\n235\n00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:52,490\n>> and so all that's blocked.\n\n236\n00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,950\nAnd so those disappear.\n\n237\n00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,121\nBut it's also blocked the main article\n\n238\n00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:56,797\nimage\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n239\n00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:59,075\n>> and their little stock ticker thing\n>> Yeah.\n\n240\n00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,900\n>> over here is broken too.\n\n241\n00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,025\nThe scripts for\nthis page are no longer allowed to run.\n\n242\n00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:07,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I don't trust CNN and so\n\n243\n00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,035\nI'm blocking that and, honestly,\nit made the page kinda better, didn't it?\n\n244\n00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:11,924\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n245\n00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:14,340\n>> It's, so aside from the big\npicture missing from right there,\n\n246\n00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,140\nthe rest of it is far\nmore easy to remember.\n\n247\n00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,020\n>> Yeah.\n>> Than, than what we had originally.\n\n248\n00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,697\nSo so you know, keep that in mind, you can\nuse this as a, a way of, of visiting sites\n\n249\n00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:26,460\nthat you don't necessarily trust,\nbut it may break functionality.\n\n250\n00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,310\nAnd you'll see that I, I think\nthe Google search page doesn't work\n\n251\n00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,110\nif you've got scripts turned off, and\nyou'll see other pages that break too.\n\n252\n00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,130\nSo just use it, use it responsibly.\n\n253\n00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,630\n>> Yeah.\nYou know,\n\n254\n00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,880\na lot of times, especially like\nwith that trusted zone, right?\n\n255\n00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,746\nIf we do have pages that do\nhave some security warnings.\n\n256\n00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:46,890\nThe trusted zone really helps us to,\nto pretty much say okay,\n\n257\n00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,160\nwe know that there's security things\nhere but we still trust this site and\n\n258\n00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,480\nnot have to be questioned about them\nwhen we go and visit them as well.\n\n259\n00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,070\n>> Yep.\n\n260\n00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,960\nI just removed it from that\nrestricted zone, and so\n\n261\n00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,130\nnow it's just back in the normal\ninternet zone and and there we go.\n\n262\n00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,960\nIf you ever wanna see what zone you're\nin it doesn't really show you here on\n\n263\n00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,700\nthe main screen.\n\n264\n00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,000\nThere's a a status bar that's\nkinda hidden by default.\n\n265\n00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,500\nIf you hit Alt+V,\nit brings down this extra menu.\n\n266\n00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,670\nAnd you can go under View and Toolbars,\nand you can turn on your status bar, and\n\n267\n00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,490\nthat adds this little bar down here at the\nbottom, and one of the nice things about\n\n268\n00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,980\nthat bar, well when you're not\nin a crazy layout like I've got.\n\n269\n00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,385\nWell, you know, am I wrong, it used to\nshow the the zone you're in doesn't,\n\n270\n00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:35,565\nmaybe I just screwed it up.\n\n271\n00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:38,885\nLet's just, let's try,\nI'm just going to Google.\n\n272\n00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,745\nYeah, it doesn't, you know, it used\nto actually have the zone down here.\n\n273\n00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:43,386\n>> Yep.\n>> I guess they finally\n\n274\n00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:44,535\ndid away with that.\n\n275\n00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:45,378\nBut, anyhow,\n\n276\n00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:47,052\nyou can add things into the zones,\n>> Yeah.\n\n277\n00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:48,955\n>> remove them based on, on what you need.\n\n278\n00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:49,669\nYou know it,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n279\n00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,664\n>> it just depends on what\nyour organization deals with.\n\n280\n00:12:51,664 --> 00:12:54,783\nI've found that if you're about to go to a\nwebsite that you needed to place into your\n\n281\n00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:57,820\nrestricted site zone, you probably\njust don't need to go to that website.\n\n282\n00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n283\n00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,850\nBut but more often than not you're\ndealing with trusted sites.\n\n284\n00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,500\nYou need to run some kind of software on\na webpage, it's being blocked by default,\n\n285\n00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,590\nbut you trust that site so\nyou allow it to be run.\n\n286\n00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,040\nAll right.\n\n287\n00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,400\nWhat are, what are some of the other\nfeatures we need to touch on?\n\n288\n00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,760\nAnd we don't, we don't need to do\na full on exploratory endeavor in IE11.\n\n289\n00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,965\nBut the privacy settings.\n\n290\n00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Are kinda nice.\n\n291\n00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:26,238\nThis is somewhat new because IE 11\nnow has the new opt-out feature,\n\n292\n00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,910\nthe, the do not track flag.\n\n293\n00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,120\nRight.\n>> That says,\n\n294\n00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,500\nwe don't want web sites to be able to\nfollow our cookies from site to site to\n\n295\n00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,710\nsite to know, you know,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n296\n00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,400\n>> who we are and where we've been.\n\n297\n00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,500\nSo we can come in, and under the privacies\nthat we can control exactly,\n\n298\n00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,410\nyou know\n>> Location.\n\n299\n00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,350\n>> what sites are allowed\nto create cookies,\n\n300\n00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,240\nare not allowed to create cookies.\n\n301\n00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,321\nWe can tailor the pop-up blocker to\nallow some sites to display pop-ups or\n\n302\n00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:50,670\nmost sites not to.\n\n303\n00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,785\nSo we can choose to, to lessen\nthat security if we ever want to.\n\n304\n00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n305\n00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,115\n>> And and it can be done in general for\nall sites using this slider.\n\n306\n00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or it can be done for\n\n307\n00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,080\nspecific sites in here.\n\n308\n00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,790\nAnd specifying certain domains,\n\n309\n00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,620\nwhether they're blocked or\nallowed for for creating cookies.\n\n310\n00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,470\nAll right, now I will tell you one thing.\n\n311\n00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,894\nIf you block cookies,\nit can cause some problems.\n\n312\n00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And we'll use the ITProTV\n\n313\n00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,820\nwebsite as an example.\n\n314\n00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,135\nOur website uses cookies.\n\n315\n00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:20,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When you log in,\n\n316\n00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,780\nthere's a session cookie\nthat allows us to track\n\n317\n00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,280\nto know when you go from one page\nto another that it's still you.\n\n318\n00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,210\nSo if you log in, and\nyou watch an A+ show, and\n\n319\n00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,100\nthen you go and\nclick on the Windows 8 show, and\n\n320\n00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,180\nwatch an episode, when you move from\npage to page, we still know it's you.\n\n321\n00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,420\nYou're logged in,\nwe let you access the video.\n\n322\n00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,710\nIf you weren't allowed to create cookies,\nyou would log in and access the show,\n\n323\n00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,612\nand when you went to access another show,\nyou'd have to log in again.\n\n324\n00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:47,930\n>> Yep.\n>> You'd have to log in\n\n325\n00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,925\nevery time you changed pages\nbecause there would be no way for\n\n326\n00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:54,290\nus to track that you were the same\nperson from page to page.\n\n327\n00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,220\nAlmost every website that has\na login does that, right?\n\n328\n00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,410\nAmazon, Gmail,\nyou know all of them do that\n\n329\n00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,483\nwhere we really have risk though\nis not within a single site.\n\n330\n00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:07,040\nIt's when one site shares those cookies\n>> Yeah.\n\n331\n00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,820\n>> with other sites, third party company.\n\n332\n00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,490\n>> Right.\n>> So you go to Google and\n\n333\n00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,720\nyou do a search for wireless radios.\n\n334\n00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,362\nAnd then you go to Amazon.com, and all the\nsudden they start recommending wireless\n\n335\n00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:19,256\nradios to you,\n>> Yeah.\n\n336\n00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:20,600\n>> right?\nThey're looking\n\n337\n00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,840\nat cookie information that was pulled from\nGoogle and correlating that together.\n\n338\n00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,650\nThat's where we start to\nhave information leaks.\n\n339\n00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> And big risk.\n\n340\n00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,030\nAnd that type of access\nis blocked by default.\n\n341\n00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,020\nYep.\n\n342\n00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,008\nOr at least in theory it is.\n\n343\n00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:33,760\n[LAUGH] All right,\nsome of the other things we got.\n\n344\n00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,925\nOur Content tab.\n\n345\n00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> And on the Content tab,\n\n346\n00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,860\nthis is where we can go in and\nwe can tweak things like family safety.\n\n347\n00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,360\n>> Right.\n\n348\n00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,580\n>> Now most websites are not rated.\n\n349\n00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,560\nThey, they don't have a rating.\n\n350\n00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know like Rated R, Rated PG,\n\n351\n00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,250\nor whatever.\n\n352\n00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,685\nBut some websites are.\n\n353\n00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:47,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And if they are you can use family\n\n354\n00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,117\nsafety to control what sites you what,\nrestriction or\n\n355\n00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,010\nrating level\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n356\n00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,806\n>> that you allow people\nto view on your computer.\n\n357\n00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:58,060\nYou can also do things like manage\nyour certificates and auto-complete.\n\n358\n00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,193\nSimple things that are Our user day\nto day interactions with websites.\n\n359\n00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:01,774\n>> Yeah.\n\n360\n00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,050\nAnd will you click on the AutoComplete\nin the Settings there,\n\n361\n00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,360\nthat's probably where we need to.\n\n362\n00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,980\nOkay.\n\n363\n00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,530\nSo notice right here we have the ability\nto have information just show up\n\n364\n00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,650\nwhen we go to and\nstart typing in the web browser.\n\n365\n00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,340\nBut a lot of times, I think in the past it\nused to actually default on the username\n\n366\n00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,895\nand passwords on forms.\n\n367\n00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A lot where in other\n\n368\n00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,290\nwords if you went to a site and\nyou'd never been there before and\n\n369\n00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,850\nyou already set this up, it would\nautomatically populate those fields for\n\n370\n00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,370\nyou, and I've actually remember\nthe first time that happened to me and\n\n371\n00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,590\nI was wondering like where in the world\ndid this information come from.\n\n372\n00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,910\n>> It is on by default Ronnie,\nthis is my laptop I turned it off.\n\n373\n00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,740\n>> Alright,\nI was going to say I thought it was on.\n\n374\n00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,730\n>> I don't like that.\n\n375\n00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,550\nI don't want internet explorer\nto store my passwords and\n\n376\n00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,990\nthe main reason I don't is I log\nin with a Microsoft account.\n\n377\n00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n378\n00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,570\nif you choose to, to cache your usernames\nand passwords, it actually synchronizes\n\n379\n00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,250\nthat to your SkyDrive, and while I know\nMicrosoft is a responsible company,\n\n380\n00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,880\nI don't want my password\nstored in my SkyDrive.\n\n381\n00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,950\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's, that's just my,\n\n382\n00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,515\nmy personal-\n>> Yeah.\n\n383\n00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:03,905\nReference.\nAnd so I don't check that off-.\n\n384\n00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:05,265\n>> Yeah.\n>> I, I actually remove that, yeah.\n\n385\n00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:07,895\n>> Yeah.\nAnd more than likely,\n\n386\n00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,845\na lot of organizations\nwould have that removed\n\n387\n00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:10,675\nanyways, too-\n>>

00:17:22,830\nit, we used to use it for\nall sorts of things,\n\n396\n00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,350\nbut now, it's really only\nuseful if you have a proxy.\n\n397\n00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,500\nIf you've got a proxy server on your\nnetwork, here's where you'd go into your\n\n398\n00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,730\nLAN settings and\nyou'd specify the proxy values.\n\n399\n00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,800\nThey actually have VPN support set up in\nhere for doing dial-up and VP PNs, but\n\n400\n00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,680\nwe normally control that\nsome other client today.\n\n401\n00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,560\nIn the old days,\nlike when you had dial up, it was set so\n\n402\n00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,580\nthat when you launch Internet Explorer,\nif you weren't already connected,\n\n403\n00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,265\nit would automatically VPN or\ndial up or whatever.\n\n404\n00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But that was 20 years ago.\n\n405\n00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,120\n>> Right.\n>> You know, today we pretty much don't\n\n406\n00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,745\n>> Don't make this up.\n\n407\n00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:55,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You've also got your programs tab, and\n\n408\n00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,640\nthis is where you can go in and you can\nspecify how you want to open links,\n\n409\n00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,090\nwhether you open it in\nInternet Explorer like in desktop, or\n\n410\n00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,620\nif you go into the the modern UI mode.\n\n411\n00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,719\n>> Right.\n>> Or, or whatever.\n\n412\n00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,870\n>> More importantly, the one they\nspecifically call out in the objectives,\n\n413\n00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,984\nhere's where we can manage our add-ons.\n\n414\n00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:13,770\n>> Add-ons.\n\n415\n00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,540\nYep.\n>> Now, Internet Explorer is great.\n\n416\n00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,990\nIt does its job, but\nit does even better when it has add-ons.\n\n417\n00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,110\nExtensions that can make it do more.\n\n418\n00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,310\nIf you look at mine,\nI've got several add-ons installed.\n\n419\n00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,250\nI've got Logitech SetPoint.\n\n420\n00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:33,600\nI have a a Logitech track ball that I\nuse at home and the set point at in,\n\n421\n00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,220\nfor internet explorer gives you what's\ncalled screen smooth scrolling.\n\n422\n00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,140\nSo, you know, if you try and\nscroll your screen using like\n\n423\n00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,220\ndouble gestures-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n424\n00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,300\n>> On a touch pad\n>> It moves in segments.\n\n425\n00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> But with smooth scrolling,\n\n426\n00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,520\nit actually just slides nice-\n>> Nice\n\n427\n00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,240\n>> And, and smooth, so\n\n428\n00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,120\nit's an optimization that\nthe the Set Point Driver installs.\n\n429\n00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,190\nI've got the Microsoft Office\nDocument Cache Handler,\n\n430\n00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,235\nwhich you can see I disabled.\n\n431\n00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,320\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd that's because I don't,\n\n432\n00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,190\nI don't use Microsoft Office.\n\n433\n00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,080\nWe've got Shockwave Flash.\n\n434\n00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080\nI, I need to be able to watch Flash.\n\n435\n00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,060\nYou know,\na lot of people think of Adobe Flash.\n\n436\n00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,080\nAdobe bought a company called Shockwave,\nand that's where the Flash came from.\n\n437\n00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,030\n>> Yup.\n\n438\n00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,230\n>> And I've got Java installed and\nenabled, and, and so you know,\n\n439\n00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,470\nwe can enable and disable those\n>> Now notice, I'm on a 64-bit machine,\n\n440\n00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,610\nbut all these plugins are 32 bit or\n32 bit and 64, right?\n\n441\n00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,460\nSo if we look at some of these,\nlike Java there is only 32 bit.\n\n442\n00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,840\nMost add-ons for\nInternet Explorer are 32 bit.\n\n443\n00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,360\nEven if your host OS is 64 bit,\n\n444\n00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,410\nyou're probably running the 32-bit\nversion of Internet Explorer.\n\n445\n00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:42,700\nYou have both, when you run\nInternet Explorer on your machine\n\n446\n00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,040\nyou actually have the 32-bit and 64-bit\none on there, you know, it's not turning\n\n447\n00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,344\nup in my auto search here, but you've got\nboth but it defaults it to 32-bit for\n\n448\n00:19:51,344 --> 00:19:55,180\nplug-in compatibility in the, you know,\nnext several years, whatever that will.\n\n449\n00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,990\n>> Probably change, but\nuntil Internet Explorer needs more than\n\n450\n00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,910\nthree gigabytes of ram it's\nnot a big pressing issue.\n\n451\n00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,910\nThere's not a lot of\nbenefit of going 64 bits,\n\n452\n00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,930\nso, so that's why we see 34,\n32 bit on a lot of that stuff.\n\n453\n00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,670\nAll right, and we can go through and,\nand customize all this,\n\n454\n00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,127\nyou know, you can disable\nadd-on's that you don't want.\n\n455\n00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,420\n>> Mm-hm.\nYou can remove add ons if you don't\n\n456\n00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,340\nneed them I don't like Java so\nI might choose to come in here and\n\n457\n00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,900\ndisable these and\nyou know enable them when I want them.\n\n458\n00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,360\nSo here I can just run down that line and\ndisable those.\n\n459\n00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,300\nYeah.\nYeah.\n\n460\n00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,580\nYeah.\nSo there you go so\n\n461\n00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,240\nI have just disabled them all and\n\n462\n00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,750\nthat will make it run a little\nmore securely not having Java.\n\n463\n00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,460\n>> That search provider\none is that one that\n\n464\n00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,820\nI always\n>> Yeah.\n\n465\n00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,830\n>> You change right by default here.\n\n466\n00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,310\n>> Yeah, you know, Microsoft obviously\nis going to default to Bing.\n\n467\n00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,800\n>> Bing.\n>> That's their search provider.\n\n468\n00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,975\nAnd then, that's cool, unless you\nwant to actually find something.\n\n469\n00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In that case,\n\n470\n00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,780\nyou might want to add in\nyour own search provider.\n\n471\n00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,450\nI, I've added in Google, here.\n\n472\n00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,510\nSo, you can add more.\n\n473\n00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,105\nYou can you know, even go and remove Bing\nif you really want to get rid of it.\n\n474\n00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:56,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But I, I usually leave it.\n\n475\n00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,730\nYou know, you might use\n>> In Yahoo!\n\n476\n00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,220\nor, or what are some of the bigger ones?\n\n477\n00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,430\nAladdin, you know,\nsome of the different ones.\n\n478\n00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,020\n>> Ask.\nAsk.com.\n\n479\n00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,070\n>> Ask Jeeves!\n\n480\n00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,560\nSo you know, different, different\ncountries have different predominant\n\n481\n00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,835\nsearch engines-\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n482\n00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,110\n>> -You know, cuz like Google and\nBing, they're good, but\n\n483\n00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,625\nthey're predominantly English-\n>> Yeah.\n\n484\n00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:16,380\n>> -So i, if you speak French, you,\nyou might not wanna use the normal Google.\n\n485\n00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,840\nYou might wanna use Google.fr or\nsomething like that.\n\n486\n00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,270\n>> And so you can go in and\nspecify a different search engine.\n\n487\n00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,380\nI know in, in China they, you know, they\nhave a completely different set of search\n\n488\n00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,450\nengines they prefer and,\nby all means, pop that in here and\n\n489\n00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,830\nnow you've kinda customized\nthat functionality.\n\n490\n00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,620\nOne thing worth mentioning here is that\nthis search engine, when you specify it,\n\n491\n00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,960\nit affects both the little search,\noh, let me get back into IE.\n\n492\n00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,560\n>> Yeah.\n\n493\n00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,440\n>> So, you've got where you can\nsearch right from here, and\n\n494\n00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,700\nin, in certain views you'll have\nthe search box that's over here, and\n\n495\n00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,800\nthis search writer affects both fields,\n\n496\n00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,080\nright, so I can I can search right from\nhere so I'll search for fishing, and\n\n497\n00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,230\nnow it's actually searching with Google,\nbecause I have that set as my default.\n\n498\n00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n499\n00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,210\nIt's nice to be able to have both in\ncase you do want to switch on over, and\n\n500\n00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,910\nas you saw that drop down list It\ngives you the ability to choose\n\n501\n00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,730\none over the other, as well,\n\n502\n00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,600\njust by simply choosing the B instead of\nthe G that, we saw in the address bar.\n\n503\n00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,380\n>> Yeah, that's pretty neat.\n\n504\n00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,870\nAnd then the last tab over here is the\nAdvanced tab, and that's where it really\n\n505\n00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,840\njust breaks down all the various security\nsettings, and, and tweaking whether you\n\n506\n00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,080\nwant to turn those on and off The majority\nof these do center around security.\n\n507\n00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,820\n>> Right.\n>> So adjusting that overall behavior,\n\n508\n00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,740\nin fact, you'll see an entire section\ndown here towards the bottom that is just\n\n509\n00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,145\nbased on scripting and here, in security.\n\n510\n00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you'll see,\n\n511\n00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,080\nyou know,\nwhether we allow local content to run,\n\n512\n00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,350\nwhether we check certificates for\nrevocation and, and so on.\n\n513\n00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,200\nAll those can be tweaked.\n\n514\n00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,260\nNow there is a neat little\noption up here towards the top\n\n515\n00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,005\nwhich says use software rendering\ninstead of GPU rendering.\n\n516\n00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:53,520\n>> mm-hm\n>> IE 11 supports rendering webpages\n\n517\n00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,850\nusing your graphical processor,\nusing your video card to do the rendering.\n\n518\n00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:03,210\nOften times it's faster and it allows\nthe screen to scroll more smoothly.\n\n519\n00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,340\nIf you have problems with that,\nif Internet Explorer is constantly\n\n520\n00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,110\nblanking out, turning into a black square\nor if it's really choppy when you scroll,\n\n521\n00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,420\nyou might prefer the software\nrenderer instead.\n\n522\n00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,290\nAnd so you can change that setting.\n\n523\n00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,710\nIt does require a restart.\n\n524\n00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,120\n>> Mm. Yeah. >> Before it takes effect.\n\n525\n00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,822\nAnd, and it's not just a restart of IE,\nit's a restart of your whole computer.\n\n526\n00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:25,697\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You gotta reboot before it takes\n\n527\n00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:26,600\neffect, right?\n\n528\n00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,130\nAlright, so this is some of the general\nsettings that we have in there, and the,\n\n529\n00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:34,860\nyou know, the, the new objected that was\nadded you know, let me pull it up here.\n\n530\n00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,650\nIt's configure IE 11 settings, including\nadd-ons, download, security, and privacy.\n\n531\n00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,060\nI think we saw all of\nthem except downloads.\n\n532\n00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,370\n>> All right.\n>> Downloads have moved off to\n\n533\n00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,020\na different location.\n\n534\n00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,710\nWhenever you download a file in IE,\nyou know, it prompts you to download.\n\n535\n00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,030\nAnd, so, maybe I wanna get\nthe 7-zip archiver, right?\n\n536\n00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:59,121\nSo, I go into the 7-zip webpage And\nI'll go to download it All right.\n\n537\n00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:02,303\nSo, when I go to download\na file In Internet Explorer,\n\n538\n00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:06,864\nit's going to give me a little pop up to\nsave, any time now, there we go, and so\n\n539\n00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:11,635\nI can choose to save it and it's going to\nsave to the default download location, or\n\n540\n00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:14,950\nI can do Save As and\nI can save it somewhere else, right?\n\n541\n00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,700\nI'll just hit Save, and\nit's gonna save, all right.\n\n542\n00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,720\nSo it's saved it.\n\n543\n00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,810\nI can now run it or I can open that\nfolder and look at what's in there.\n\n544\n00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,680\nWell, one of the problems I have is,\n\n545\n00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,420\nis, I don't really like\nthe default download location.\n\n546\n00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,190\n>> Right.\n>> I'm always constantly doing Save As and\n\n547\n00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,530\nbrowsing other places.\n\n548\n00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,565\nSo we can change the way the downloads\nwork, to specify an alternate location.\n\n549\n00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:35,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n550\n00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,320\n>> If you go up to your\nsettings button and go to, oh,\n\n551\n00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,155\nlet's see it is in here somewhere,\nthere, view downloads.\n\n552\n00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:42,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n553\n00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,200\n>> You'll get your download manager,\nand this is where you can see all\n\n554\n00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,155\nthe stuff that you've downloaded for\nquite some time.\n\n555\n00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It, it goes back quite a ways.\n\n556\n00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,400\nSo here you can see the 7zip\nfile I just downloaded, or\n\n557\n00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,550\nsome of the Cisco files I downloaded\nin our Cisco show, or Linux,\n\n558\n00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,510\nyou know, so you can see different that,\nthat I've been downloading.\n\n559\n00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,820\nThis is cool cuz it also\nshows the location.\n\n560\n00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,010\nI can see where I saved them have been to.\n\n561\n00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,140\nAnd so I go and find them.\n\n562\n00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,650\n>> Right.\n>> And, and, and open them or\n\n563\n00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,490\nwhatever, if I need to, right.\n\n564\n00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,640\nBut if I wanna change where\nI'm downloading to by default,\n\n565\n00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,440\nI got a little options.\n\n566\n00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,030\n>> Options.\n>> Link down here.\n\n567\n00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,300\nAnd if we go into options, that's where\nwe can specify an alternate location and\n\n568\n00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,990\nwhether or not it notifies us.\n\n569\n00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,530\n>> Yeah.\n>> When they're done.\n\n570\n00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,760\nRight, if you're\ndownloading a lot of files,\n\n571\n00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,420\nthose notifications get kind of annoying.\n\n572\n00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you can turn that off, all right.\n\n573\n00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,900\nOther than that,\n\n574\n00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,040\nthere's not a whole heck of a lot of\noptions of downloads, right Ronny?\n\n575\n00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,260\n>> Nope, that's it.\n\n576\n00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,450\nYou're just specifying where.\n\n577\n00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,650\n>> So pretty cut and dry there.\n\n578\n00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,288\nNot anything too crazy,\nand that's basically it.\n\n579\n00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,119\n>> Yep.\n\n580\n00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,330\n>> All right.\n\n581\n00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,710\nThe last thing that Microsoft calls\nout s the compatibility view.\n\n582\n00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,160\nEvery time a new new version of\nInternet Explorer comes out.\n\n583\n00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,530\nSomething changes and some websites\nwill fail to render properly or\n\n584\n00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,400\nthey just break.\n\n585\n00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,100\n>> Right.\n\n586\n00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,360\n>> And it's,\nit's frustrating to say the least.\n\n587\n00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,110\nYou know if you run a website\nwell like we do with IT pro TV.\n\n588\n00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,820\nEvery time a new version of IE comes\nout we've got to look at our website.\n\n589\n00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,210\nAnd make sure it will\nrender properly in IE.\n\n590\n00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,990\nWell, Microsoft recognizes this\nis a problem not enough for\n\n591\n00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,720\nthem to stop breaking it every time\nthey release a new version but\n\n592\n00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,327\nthey do recognize this is a problem and so\nwhen new versions of IE come out, they may\n\n593\n00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:24,900\nforce you to upgrade they may force you\nto go to IE eleven or twelve or whatever.\n\n594\n00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,230\nBut they give you what's called\nthe compatibility view, so\n\n595\n00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,340\nthat you can run it in the way that\nan older version ran to make sure that\n\n596\n00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,395\nyour websites are still compatibility and\nfunctioning.\n\n597\n00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:35,220\n>> Right.\n\n598\n00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,400\n>> This is really useful for websites\nthat have web based applications or\n\n599\n00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,450\nline of business applications.\n\n600\n00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,140\nI used to work in the finance industry and\nwe had a document\n\n601\n00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,560\nimaging solution that was web based and\nthat document imagine solution,\n\n602\n00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,820\nI remember, when IE9 came out,\nCompletely killed it.\n\n603\n00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,280\nSo we had to stay at IE8 in order\nto keep running this solution.\n\n604\n00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,673\n>> Right.\n>> Right well, well there's our problem.\n\n605\n00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:57,686\nIf you stay at IE 8,\n\n606\n00:26:57,686 --> 00:27:00,799\nyou lose all the security fixes\nthat were introduced in IE 9.\n\n607\n00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,424\n>> Right.\n>> And now 10 and 11.\n\n608\n00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:07,330\nSo you wanna run the newer browser,\nbut you wanna maintain compatibility.\n\n609\n00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:07,900\nAll right.\n\n610\n00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,120\nSo there's a neat way we can handle that,\nand I'll show you a great example.\n\n611\n00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,710\nWhen Internet Explorer 11 came out,\nMicrosoft CRM\n\n612\n00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:23,160\nis an account management software, CRM\nwas actually broken in IE 11, all right.\n\n613\n00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,960\nI saw it was, it still is.\n\n614\n00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,250\nIt still is right at the moment\nof the episode filming.\n\n615\n00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,980\nIt has been months since I11 came out.\n\n616\n00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,020\nSo, when you go to a CRM webpage,\nwith IE 11,\n\n617\n00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,460\nit renders the page in the mobile view.\n\n618\n00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,520\nSee what I'm looking at here?\n\n619\n00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,630\nThis is what should be\nshown on a cell phone.\n\n620\n00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,610\nBut I'm not on a cell phone,\nI'm just in IE 11.\n\n621\n00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:47,560\nAnd what's happening is the c r m is\nlooking at my browser ID, and saying,\n\n622\n00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,520\nall right, are you IE 7, 8, 9, or 10?\n\n623\n00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520\nOh, you're not?\n>> None.\n\n624\n00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,420\n>> Well let me give you the mobile view.\n\n625\n00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> You must be a, you must be a phone.\n\n626\n00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,860\nAll right.\n\n627\n00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,600\nAnd so, it's, it's broken, right?\n\n628\n00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,265\nJust cuz they, they didn't take\ninto account future browser IDs.\n\n629\n00:27:59,265 --> 00:28:00,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You'd, you'd think\n\n630\n00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,270\nMicrosoft would figure that out, right?\n\n631\n00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,430\n>> Right.\n>> So what do I do?\n\n632\n00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,690\nDo I downgrade to IE 10?\n\n633\n00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,320\nThat would fix the problem.\n\n634\n00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,270\n>> Yeah.\n>> If I go back to IE 10,\n\n635\n00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,550\nit'll render fine.\n\n636\n00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,200\nBut then I lose the security\nupdates of IE 11.\n\n637\n00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,620\nSo instead what I can do,\nis I can go into Compatibility View, and\n\n638\n00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,690\nI can punch in this URL, and I can say,\nwhenever you go to this URL,\n\n639\n00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,540\nrender it in the old remote of\nInternet Explorer so it renders right.\n\n640\n00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,440\nSo to do that we just go under\nour Settings, and we go to\n\n641\n00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,810\nCompatibility View Settings, and you add\nthe website that you want to render.\n\n642\n00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:39,110\nIt accepts wildcards, so you can do like\n*.microsoft.com if you wanted, right?\n\n643\n00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,044\nBut I've got this test server\nthat I'm using here, 1011019.\n\n644\n00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:44,321\nSo once we punch it in my IP.\n\n645\n00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:50,584\nAnd once we've got that in there,we can\nhit close and then the page reloads and\n\n646\n00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:54,788\nwhat do I get after a reload I\nget the full version of CRM,\n\n647\n00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:58,815\nnow the page is working right\nit is not my mobile view,\n\n648\n00:28:58,815 --> 00:29:03,056\nI see you know what I intend to see and\nit works properly.\n\n649\n00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:09,520\nAll right and it is just that this\npage was not updated to support IE 11.\n\n650\n00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520\nMakes a huge difference.\n\n651\n00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,240\n>> It really does.\n\n652\n00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,230\n>> Yep.\n>> So now I can run IE 11,\n\n653\n00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,850\nI can run the newer browser.\n\n654\n00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,120\nI get all the security fixes, but\nI run it in compatibility mode, so\n\n655\n00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,430\nmy products, services,\nwhatever, they still function.\n\n656\n00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,650\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it gives me the best of both worlds.\n\n657\n00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:23,960\nRight?\nAnd then, eventually,\n\n658\n00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,975\nMicrosoft will release an update for\nCRM that will recognize IE 11.\n\n659\n00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then it'll be fine.\n\n660\n00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,080\n>> Yep.\n\n661\n00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,070\nSo, so that's compatibility mode.\n\n662\n00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,230\nIt, it's pretty handy.\n\n663\n00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,930\nIt's a nice thing to have.\n\n664\n00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,890\n>> Right.\n>> It ensures that you can upgrade and\n\n665\n00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,920\nnot, you know, have those growing pains\nof dealing with, with, broken webpages.\n\n666\n00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,420\n>> Yeah.\n\n667\n00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,630\n>> All right, Ronnie, I, I think that's\na pretty good run-down of IE 11.\n\n668\n00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,650\nCan you think anything else to throw in?\n\n669\n00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,660\n>> Nope.\n\n670\n00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,352\nYeah, I, I think that's everything.\n\n671\n00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:53,780\n>> All right, well, there's a lot\nof setting sin Internet Explorer.\n\n672\n00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,740\nYou can browse through, poke around,\nsee what all is in there.\n\n673\n00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,130\nThere are settings that you may\nhave to adjust from time to time.\n\n674\n00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,420\nWe covered the major ones and\nwhat's likely to show up on the exam.\n\n675\n00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,540\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the segment.\n\n676\n00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,120\nAs always if you have any questions, make\nsure you, you throw them on the IT Pro TV\n\n677\n00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,043\nwebsite on the top of every one of our\nweb pages is a link that says Q&A.\n\n678\n00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:15,940\nYou can click that, post your questions,\nwe monitor and answer them.\n\n679\n00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,780\n>> Yep.\n>> We get those taken care of, so, so\n\n680\n00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,350\nif you have any more questions on IE or\nanything else,\n\n681\n00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,746\nmake sure you jump over there and\npost them.\n\n682\n00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,856\n>> Right.\n>> All right otherwise will wrap it up\n\n683\n00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:27,275\nhere and we will see you guys\nin the next ITproTV special.\n\n684\n00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:34,070\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:09,305\n[SOUND]\nAll right,\n\n2\n00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:11,710\nwelcome back to another special limited-\n>> Right.\n\n3\n00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,754\n>> Edition episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:13,754 --> 00:00:18,265\nWe're jumping through and, and basically\nrecapping on a couple of new objectives\n\n5\n00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:21,553\nthat were added by Microsoft\nin January of 2014 as they,\n\n6\n00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:25,430\nthey refreshed the exam to update\nit from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1.\n\n7\n00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,863\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, and as you guys know,\n\n8\n00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:29,908\nwe filmed all of our episodes using\nWindows 8.1 already cuz we knew it\n\n9\n00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:30,800\nwas coming.\n\n10\n00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,290\nBut they did add a couple little\nobjectives that, that weren't there before\n\n11\n00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,370\nthat we just wanna come back and touch on\nspecifically to make sure that, that you\n\n12\n00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,504\nguys are prepared for every eventuality\nthat might turn up on the exam.\n\n13\n00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:42,044\n>> Yep.\n>> So,\n\n14\n00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:45,660\ntoday we're gonna be taking\na look at Hyper-V, and, and\n\n15\n00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,206\njust a couple of things that it,\nwe already covered Hyper-V.\n\n16\n00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,210\n>> Yep.\n>> And we had a whole episode on it, but\n\n17\n00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,480\nthere's a few specific things they call\nout now that we need to tackle just\n\n18\n00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,490\nto make sure that we're ready.\n\n19\n00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,600\n>> Yeah.\nYou know,\n\n20\n00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,860\none of the neat things about\nthe Hyper-V is that we actually have\n\n21\n00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,280\nit natively in the operating\nsystem itself.\n\n22\n00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,390\nSo we need to make sure that we can\nconfigure it the way that we need it to,\n\n23\n00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,970\nand to take advantage of\nthe newer advanced features,\n\n24\n00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,470\nsuch as being able to move\nthe hard drives off, and\n\n25\n00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,890\nbeing able to provide the integration\nservices that we need.\n\n26\n00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,582\n>> Yep.\nNow prior to Windows 8.1, well,\n\n27\n00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:16,052\nreally just Windows 8.\n\n28\n00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:18,584\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> So Win, Windows 8\nwas the first Microsoft client operating\n\n29\n00:01:18,584 --> 00:01:19,151\nsystem-\n>> Yeah.\n\n30\n00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:20,688\n>> To feature Hyper-V.\n\n31\n00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:24,252\nAnd if you created a virtual machine,\nit required you to specify a folder where\n\n32\n00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,132\nthat virtual machine-\n>> Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:26,670\n>> Would stay.\n\n34\n00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,890\nAnd, and, you know,\nyou set a default folder.\n\n35\n00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,214\nWe did that in the other episode.\n\n36\n00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:29,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n37\n00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,170\n>> But what if you change\nyour mind down the road and\n\n38\n00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,880\nyou say, you know what, I don't\nwant that VM on my C drive anymore.\n\n39\n00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,912\nI just bought a new 2 terabyte\nhard drive that's my D drive.\n\n40\n00:01:38,912 --> 00:01:40,601\n>> Right.\n>> I wanna move it to the D drive.\n\n41\n00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,550\nWell, what you had to do is you had\nto shut the virtual machine down,\n\n42\n00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,825\nyou had to copy the hard drive over.\n\n43\n00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:47,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> You had to change its settings to point\n\n44\n00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,150\nto the new hard drive, start it back up.\n\n45\n00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,002\nIt was this whole routine.\n\n46\n00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:51,996\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And it was kind of a hassle.\n\n47\n00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:52,590\nAll right.\n\n48\n00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,680\nSo in Hyper-V in Windows 8.1, they added\n\n49\n00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,910\nnot only a simple, easy-to-use wizard for-\n>> Yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,250\n>> For moving that drive from\none location to another, but\n\n51\n00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,090\nthey also added the ability to do it live,\nwhile the VM is on and running.\n\n52\n00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's the cool part.\n\n53\n00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,660\nYou can move it without\nactually shutting the VM down.\n\n54\n00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,630\nNow, I'll be honest with you.\n\n55\n00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,943\nIf you're running Hyper-V on Windows 8,\nit's not a production environment.\n\n56\n00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:18,580\n>> Nope.\n>> It should just be test and R&D.\n\n57\n00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,780\nSo you can shut the VM down.\n\n58\n00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,425\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it'll actually move faster.\n\n59\n00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, but\n\n60\n00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,280\nbecause it's a new feature,\n\n61\n00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,800\nbecause it is on the exam, let's talk\nabout the live migration side of it.\n\n62\n00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,043\nThe, the way you do\nit's actually the same.\n\n63\n00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:30,004\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The only difference is\n\n64\n00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,250\nwhether you shut the VM down or not.\n\n65\n00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:31,950\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n66\n00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,220\nlet's let's take a look at my laptop here\nand on my laptop I'm, I'm running Hyper-V.\n\n67\n00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,680\nAnd I've got a virtual machine here\ncalled Windows 8 Client and I'm,\n\n68\n00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,410\nI'm just gonna start it up.\n\n69\n00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,600\nAnd, and\nit's exactly what the name implies.\n\n70\n00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,040\nWell, it's actually Windows 8.1.\n\n71\n00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,095\nSo I'm running Windows 8.1 Enterprise.\n\n72\n00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:51,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Inside of this virtual machine and\n\n73\n00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,760\nI'll just fire it up here.\n\n74\n00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,140\nYou know, one of the nice things about\nWindows 8 is that it does boot up rather\n\n75\n00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,665\nquickly.\n\n76\n00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:57,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n77\n00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,060\n>> Let me set a slightly smaller\nresolution so it'll fit on my screen.\n\n78\n00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,130\nThat didn't quite work out,\nbut but anyhow.\n\n79\n00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,070\nSo there it goes.\n\n80\n00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,383\nSo I can log in here and now I'm,\nI'm in the wonderful world of Windows 8.1.\n\n81\n00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:09,938\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n82\n00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:11,280\n>> All right, exciting.\n\n83\n00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,200\n>> Yep.\n\n84\n00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,970\n>> Now, the hard drive for this VM,\nif I browse onto my C drive\n\n85\n00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,500\nand into, I, I put all my stuff in C:\\VM.\n\n86\n00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,908\nAnd so, Windows 8 Client.VHDX,\nthat's it right there.\n\n87\n00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:28,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's about 8 gigs in size.\n\n88\n00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,310\nAnd notice what happened\nwhen I installed it.\n\n89\n00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,710\nI just told it to put it in C:\\VM.\n\n90\n00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,927\nI didn't put it in a nice\nlittle sub folder-\n\n91\n00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:37,088\n>> Like some of these other ones and\n\n92\n00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,496\nif I browse into virtual machines here,\nyou know, there, sure,\n\n93\n00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,290\nthere's probably something in there.\n\n94\n00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,561\nBut maybe I wanna move that into\nits own folder like this, right?\n\n95\n00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,225\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well, I could stop the VM,\n\n96\n00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:56,300\nmove that file, go edit the VM to point\nto the location, and start it back up.\n\n97\n00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,440\nBut, I'm gonna take advantage\nof that neat new feature and\n\n98\n00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,150\ndo it live while the machine is running.\n\n99\n00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,650\nTo move it,\nwe can just right-click on this guy and\n\n100\n00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,070\nyou'll see some of\nthe different options here.\n\n101\n00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,449\nThe one I'm looking for is Move.\n\n102\n00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:13,970\nAnd when we move it,\nthere's two move types.\n\n103\n00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,290\nYou can move the virtual machine itself,\nor\n\n104\n00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,866\nyou can move the virtual machine storage.\n\n105\n00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:18,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now,\n\n106\n00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,470\nin Windows Server 2012 you see both\noptions because you might have a cluster\n\n107\n00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,950\nand you can move the whole VM.\n\n108\n00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,630\nIn Windows 8, you only see the storage\noption because Windows 8 doesn't support\n\n109\n00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,640\nclustering, so\nthis is the only one that's valid.\n\n110\n00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,660\nSo I got move the machine\nstorage right there.\n\n111\n00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,080\nAll right.\n\n112\n00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,040\nAnd then it's gonna ask me\nto choose the move options.\n\n113\n00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,000\nI can move all the machine's\ndata to a single location, or\n\n114\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,970\nwe can move it to different locations if\nI have more than one virtual hard drive.\n\n115\n00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,016\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, we can, we can go that route.\n\n116\n00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:49,904\nAnd then move only the virtual\nmachine's virtual hard disks.\n\n117\n00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:52,620\nIn other words don't move, like,\nthe configuration files, too.\n\n118\n00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,394\n>> Yeah\n>> Just the, the virtual hard disks.\n\n119\n00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,257\nAll right.\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and move all of it.\n\n120\n00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:57,621\nI'll move the whole, whole thing.\n\n121\n00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:59,340\nWhat the heck?\n\n122\n00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,237\nAll right, and I'm gonna browse that\nfolder I made just a moment ago,\n\n123\n00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:08,580\nwhich was C:/VM/, whoops,\nthat's not what I want.\n\n124\n00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,625\n[LAUGH] Cancel.\n\n125\n00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:12,040\nWindows 8 Client, there we go.\n\n126\n00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:17,095\nAll right, so\nthat's where I want to move it.\n\n127\n00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:19,535\nSo it shows that it is, you know, 7.9-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n128\n00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,242\n>> Gigs of data or whatever.\n\n129\n00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:22,162\nAnd and so it's gonna move it.\n\n130\n00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:27,952\nIt gives me a summary of what it's gonna\ndo and I can go ahead and hit Finish.\n\n131\n00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,992\nAll right, now it's gonna do the move.\n\n132\n00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:32,722\nAnd here's the cool part is\nthe VM's still up and running.\n\n133\n00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:33,522\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n134\n00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:35,970\nNow, if this is Windows 8, you know, then,\n\n135\n00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,740\nthen it's probably just test and\ndevelopment.\n\n136\n00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,242\nWe probably-\n>> Yeah.\n\n137\n00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:38,966\n>> Don't really care so\n\n138\n00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:39,770\nmuch about it running.\n\n139\n00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,720\nIn a server environment, we'd really care.\n\n140\n00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,270\nWe'd wanna make sure that VM was running.\n\n141\n00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,780\nBut right now, it's going to move it,\nand the way it's doing it\n\n142\n00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,540\nis by creating a copy-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n143\n00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,230\n>> Of the hard drive and it's tracking\nany changes occurring to the base.\n\n144\n00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,180\nAnd so it's gonna copy it over.\n\n145\n00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,990\nAnd then it's gonna synchronize\nthe changes between the two, and\n\n146\n00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,270\nwhen the two are exact\nmirrors of each other,\n\n147\n00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,240\nthen it'll flip over to the other one and\noff you go.\n\n148\n00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,500\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n149\n00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,936\n>> The problem is, it's an 8 gig file, so\n\n150\n00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:06,820\nit's gonna take the-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,880\n>> Same amount of time it takes to\n\n152\n00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,980\ncopy an 8 gig file.\n\n153\n00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,830\nAnd because the system is running,\n\n154\n00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,866\nI've now got multiple disk IO events-\n>> Right.\n\n155\n00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:15,473\n>> That are occurring.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,828\n>> And so I've created contentions.\n\n157\n00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:18,940\nSo the performance is\ngonna be a little slow.\n\n158\n00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,130\nI'm on a 256 gig SSD,\nwhich normally is pretty fast.\n\n159\n00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I guess that went fast enough.\n\n160\n00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,168\nBut on a-\n>> Yep.\n\n161\n00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:28,065\n>> Traditional stated drive\nit might even be slower.\n\n162\n00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,222\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it moved,\n\n163\n00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,730\nmy Windows 8 Client is still running here.\n\n164\n00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,244\n>> Yep.\n>> You know, it says it's running,\n\n165\n00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:34,220\nit's up, it's happy.\n\n166\n00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,510\nAnd now, my storage is moved.\n\n167\n00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,810\nIf I browse back to C:/VM.\n\n168\n00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,980\n>> Right, look at that, it's gone.\n\n169\n00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,220\n>> That VHD is gone.\n\n170\n00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,760\nAnd if I go into Windows 8 Client.\n\n171\n00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,500\n>> Oh, look at there.\n>> Here,\n\n172\n00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,320\nI've got the virtual\nhard disk is right there,\n\n173\n00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,930\nas well as the virtual\nmachine definition files.\n\n174\n00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,910\nIt's all been moved into its\nown folder nice and neat.\n\n175\n00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right.\n\n176\n00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,590\nPrevious versions of Hyber-V just\nlumped everything into one folder and\n\n177\n00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,250\nit was a mess.\n\n178\n00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This gives us a good way to\n\n179\n00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,630\neasily organize our VMs without\neven taking them offline.\n\n180\n00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,770\n>> Right.\n>> It's pretty cool.\n\n181\n00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,030\n>> Yep.\n\n182\n00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,290\n>> So, cool feature like that,\n\n183\n00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,700\nyou can see why Microsoft-\n>> Right.\n\n184\n00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,610\n>> Wants it on the objectives.\n\n185\n00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,212\nAnd because it's on the objectives, and\n\n186\n00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,400\nit's new and cool-\n>> Yeah.\n\n187\n00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,290\n>> It's that much more\nlikely to be on the exam.\n\n188\n00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,320\n>> All right.\n\n189\n00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,820\nYep.\n\n190\n00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:17,921\n>> What, what's our,\nwe have something else, don't we?\n\n191\n00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:19,194\n>> Integration services here.\n\n192\n00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:19,730\n>> Oh, that's right.\n\n193\n00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,200\n>> Yep, we need to configure something.\n\n194\n00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,310\n>> So the other one they added\nwas the integration services.\n\n195\n00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,360\nJust another little blurb-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n196\n00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,930\n>> That we need to to, to remember.\n\n197\n00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,790\nIt used to be that we had a lot\nto do with integration services.\n\n198\n00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,570\nThat if you were running a VM,\nyou have to install them.\n\n199\n00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,747\n>> Yep.\n>> But if you're running Windows Server\n\n200\n00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,660\n2008, Windows 7, Windows 8.\n\n201\n00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,680\n>> Yep.\n>> Windows Server 2012.\n\n202\n00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,580\n>> Built in.\n\n203\n00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,660\n>> They've got it built it right in.\n\n204\n00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,885\nYeah, and you might need to update.\n\n205\n00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:42,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But Windows Update will\n\n206\n00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,330\ntake care of that.\n\n207\n00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,270\nSo we don't really have to install\nintegration services anymore, but\n\n208\n00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,420\nwe may need to configure them.\n\n209\n00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,640\nNow, if you're-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,968\n>> Sitting there going, Don,\n\n211\n00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,914\nwhat the heck are integration services?\n\n212\n00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right, let, let's recap that.\n\n213\n00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,577\nNormally, when you run a virtual machine,\nthe operating system running on the guest,\n\n214\n00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:02,034\nthe, the guest VM,\nthat OS has no idea that it's virtualized.\n\n215\n00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,043\n>> Right.\n>> It thinks that it's running on real\n\n216\n00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,100\nhardware.\n\n217\n00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,030\nRight?\n\n218\n00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,280\nBut we can install some software in there\ncalled the integration services, and\n\n219\n00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,915\nit makes the VM aware that it\nis a virtual machine, right?\n\n220\n00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:14,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It becomes what's called\n\n221\n00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,000\nan enlightened OS-\n>> There you go.\n\n222\n00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,608\n>> That's the official term,\nyou, you know, it sounds funny.\n\n223\n00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:20,315\n>> Enlightened.\n>> But it might make it on the exam.\n\n224\n00:08:20,315 --> 00:08:22,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's an enlightened OS.\n\n225\n00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,690\nAnd that OS can take certain actions\nthat actually make it more efficient and\n\n226\n00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,330\nmake it perform better.\n\n227\n00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,280\nSo if ever possible, you want to use\nintegration services, and, and Microsoft\n\n228\n00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,635\nmakes integration services available not\njust for Windows but for Linux also.\n\n229\n00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:40,289\n>> Yeah.\n>> But if you're gonna run Windows XP, or\n\n230\n00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,829\nWindows Server 2003.\n\n231\n00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:42,721\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or, or Linux,\n\n232\n00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,073\nyou have to manually install\nthe integration services,\n\n233\n00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:46,520\ndownload them from Microsoft-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n234\n00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,810\n>> And install them, or, or\nyou can use the ISO in Hyper-V here.\n\n235\n00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,560\nIf we take a virtual machine,\nlike this one,\n\n236\n00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,900\nyou can go up top to Action, and\noh no, it's not under Action.\n\n237\n00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,690\nWait a minute.\n\n238\n00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,610\nYou actually have to open the VM.\n\n239\n00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,660\nHere we go.\n\n240\n00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,828\nAnd let me, let me shrink this down.\n\n241\n00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:10,090\nI want something small that\nwon't fill my whole screen.\n\n242\n00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,230\nHow about that?\n\n243\n00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,320\nThere we go.\n\n244\n00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,226\nWhen you connect to that virtual machine,\nyou can go up here to Action.\n\n245\n00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:18,060\n>> Yeah, there it is.\n\n246\n00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,230\n>> And Insert Integration Services Setup\nDisk, and that will pop that disk in.\n\n247\n00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,720\nIt's got the integration services for\nWindows XP and Windows Server 2003 on it.\n\n248\n00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,985\nIf you're Windows 7 or 8, Server 2008 or\n2012, they've already got it.\n\n249\n00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:32,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Just do a Windows Update\n\n250\n00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,640\nto make sure they're the latest version.\n\n251\n00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,970\n>> Yep.\n>> If it's Linux, you have to go in and\n\n252\n00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,110\ndownload those from Microsoft.\n\n253\n00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,200\nThe Linux drivers are not on this disk.\n\n254\n00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,412\nBut you just pop in that ISO and\ninstall it if, if that's what you need.\n\n255\n00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:44,080\nAll right.\n\n256\n00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,150\nBut otherwise, the only thing that we\nreally configure with the integration\n\n257\n00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,282\nservices is to turn them on or off.\n\n258\n00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:51,730\nAll right, if I go up to File and\n\n259\n00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,524\nSettings, down here I've\ngot Integration Services.\n\n260\n00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:57,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n261\n00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,810\n>> And\nhere's where we can turn them on or off.\n\n262\n00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,580\nRight, so not,\nnot a whole heck of a lot to choose from.\n\n263\n00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n264\n00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,500\nSo let, let's kind of run down\nthe list and see what they are.\n\n265\n00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,300\nThe first one is Operating\nsystem shutdown.\n\n266\n00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,380\nAnd with Operating system shutdown,\n\n267\n00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,500\nthat just means if I shut down my host OS,\nwhat happens to the guests?\n\n268\n00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,449\nIt would be nice to gracefully-\n>> Yeah.\n\n269\n00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,180\n>> Shut them down, the equivalent of\npulling up the Start Menu and, you know,\n\n270\n00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,240\ngoing to Shut down.\n\n271\n00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,010\nBut if, if we don't have integration\nservices, when we shut the host OS, it's\n\n272\n00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,894\nlike we're yanking the power plug out-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n273\n00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:28,640\n>> From the guest OS's, right?\n\n274\n00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,080\n>> Right.\n>> They just die out and that, that's bad.\n\n275\n00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,020\nWe can lose, you know,-\n>> Yeah.\n\n276\n00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,630\n>> Rights to the disk and so on.\n\n277\n00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,140\nSo operating system shut down\nallows us to do graceful shutdowns\n\n278\n00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,890\nfrom Hyper-V instead of from\ninside of the guest OS.\n\n279\n00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,060\n>> Yeah.\nWe've got a time synchronization here\n\n280\n00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,272\nthat allows a guest OS to synchronize\nwith the host machine as well, so\n\n281\n00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:46,740\nthat the time is actually the same.\n\n282\n00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,755\nAnd that could be very important for\nus in a work environment, too.\n\n283\n00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:50,570\n>> Yeah, you know,\n\n284\n00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,322\nfor authentication purposes-\n>> Yeah.\n\n285\n00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:54,440\n>> You know,\nif you're gonna use Kerberos or\n\n286\n00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,335\nauthentication like that, it,\nit needs a, a reliable time stamp.\n\n287\n00:10:57,335 --> 00:10:58,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, basically,\n\n288\n00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,675\nit makes all of the VM clocks\nsynchronize with the host OS.\n\n289\n00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,396\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that's normally a good thing.\n\n290\n00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,010\nLike Ronnie said,\nthere's one scenario where it's bad.\n\n291\n00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,174\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you're running a domain controller,\n\n292\n00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:09,237\nan active directory domain controller-\n>> Yeah.\n\n293\n00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:12,452\n>> In a virtual machine, the time\nsynchronization will screw it up royally.\n\n294\n00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:12,988\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:13,889\n>> And so you wanna turn\n\n296\n00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:14,584\nthat off-\n>> Yeah.\n\n297\n00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:18,184\n>> For domain controllers, but pretty mu,\nwhoops, pretty much anything else that,\n\n298\n00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:20,490\nthat works out fine and, and\nit's a good option to have.\n\n299\n00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,970\nAll right, Data Exchange is the next one.\n\n300\n00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,820\nData Exchange is a really-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n301\n00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,280\n>> Complex way of saying,\nshare my clipboard.\n\n302\n00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,920\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n303\n00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,910\nIf you copy something into\nthe clipboard on your host machine,\n\n304\n00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,990\nwouldn't it be nice to be able to\npaste it into the virtual machine?\n\n305\n00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,470\nAnd Data Exchange allows that.\n\n306\n00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,476\nYou're exchanging that clipboard data\nbetween your host and your guest.\n\n307\n00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:42,318\n>> Yep.\n\n308\n00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:43,009\nYou know-\n>> Heart-\n\n309\n00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:43,509\n>> No, no, go ahead.\n\n310\n00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,381\n>> Go ahead. Yeah.\n\n311\n00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:44,984\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n312\n00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:46,523\nHeartbeat is the next one and, and\n\n313\n00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:48,170\nbasically if your guest OS crashes,\n\n314\n00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,402\nhow do you know it, right?\n\n315\n00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:50,031\n>> Right.\n>> If a tree\n\n316\n00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:50,597\nfalls-\n>> Yeah.\n\n317\n00:11:50,597 --> 00:11:51,981\n>> In the woods and nobody is there,\n\n318\n00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:53,320\nhow do you?\nDoes it make a sound?\n\n319\n00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,815\nIf a VM crashes in Hyper-V, and\nyou're not viewing it, how do you know?\n\n320\n00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,010\nThe heartbeat is how you know.\n\n321\n00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,285\nHyper-V can monitor the VM.\n\n322\n00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,505\nIt basically sends a message and\nsays, are you there?\n\n323\n00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,825\nAnd the guest machine just\nresponds back and says, yes.\n\n324\n00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:08,730\nAnd if it ever happens that it doesn't\nrespond, then Hyper-V can recognize that.\n\n325\n00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,300\nAnd it can either try and restart the VM\nor generate event log messages so\n\n326\n00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,540\nthat you can become aware.\n\n327\n00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,230\nIt's just a quick and easy monitor\nto see if the VM is operational.\n\n328\n00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,752\n>> Yeah.\nThe idea of the backup here,\n\n329\n00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:21,310\nlike they talk about here,\nthe volume checkpoint.\n\n330\n00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,850\nWe used to call these snap.\n\n331\n00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,215\n>> Snapshots, yeah.\n>> Snapshots.\n\n332\n00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:29,530\nYeah, the idea of us being able to take\nthat entire VM while it's running or\n\n333\n00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,582\nwhen we shut it down, to essentially\nmake a snapshot of that for the,\n\n334\n00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:37,100\nthe VM is a really neat thing for\nus to do.\n\n335\n00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,140\nWe make changes.\n\n336\n00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,540\nThe machine crashes.\n\n337\n00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,670\nWe can always restore a snapshot and\nwe're back up and running.\n\n338\n00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,760\n>> Yep, and we, we showed snapshots-\n>> Yep.\n\n339\n00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,060\n>> In the, in the other episode\nwhere we covered Hyper-V.\n\n340\n00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,230\nWe just didn't talk about-\n>> Yeah.\n\n341\n00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,140\n>> The integration service that powers it.\n\n342\n00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,710\nWe actually just used this a second ago.\n\n343\n00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> When we did that hard drive move,\n\n344\n00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,030\nit was really using snapshots-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n345\n00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:59,010\n>> To power that, to create that duplicate\ncopy of the hard drive and configuration.\n\n346\n00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,000\nA snapshot grabs not just the hard drive,\nbut\n\n347\n00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,910\nthe the virtual machine\nconfiguration file.\n\n348\n00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> As well as what's in RAM,\n\n349\n00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,855\nif the machine is on at the time.\n\n350\n00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:07,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n351\n00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,630\n>> So it gathers all that together and\nit's this backup volume checkpoint\n\n352\n00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,430\nintegration service-\n>> Yeah.\n\n353\n00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:12,930\n>> That allows that.\n\n354\n00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,240\nAnd the last one is Guest services.\n\n355\n00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,396\nAnd the Guest services,\nthat's kind of a, a potpourri.\n\n356\n00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,991\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, just a, a potluck or, or\n\n357\n00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:23,197\nmiscellaneous-\n>> Yeah.\n\n358\n00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:25,176\n>> Gathering of, of oth, other features,\n\n359\n00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:27,586\nthings like the accelerated video adapter-\n>> Yeah.\n\n360\n00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:30,988\n>> That's now present in Windows 8 and,\nand some of the remote FX support and\n\n361\n00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:33,420\nstuff gets kind of lumped\nunder this Guest services.\n\n362\n00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,984\n>> Wouldn't this have been like the mouse\nmovement in between the virtual\n\n363\n00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:36,677\nmachine, or not?\n\n364\n00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:38,820\n>> You know, it, it,\nyou'd think it would be, but it's not.\n\n365\n00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,348\n>> Yeah, okay.\n>> The,\n\n366\n00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:41,694\nthe mouse integration is now just\na part of integration services.\n\n367\n00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:42,205\n>> There you go.\n\n368\n00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,540\n>> And I don't think you can turn it off.\n\n369\n00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,104\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> I think it,\n\n370\n00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:45,021\nit's just kind of built in now.\n\n371\n00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:45,763\n>> Well, that's probably pretty good.\n\n372\n00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:47,560\n[LAUGH]\n>> But but yeah, so it,\n\n373\n00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,960\nit's just kind of the, the remnants.\n\n374\n00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,350\n>> Okay.\n>> Other little things that Microsoft\n\n375\n00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,940\nthought of that, that were nice.\n\n376\n00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> You don't need any of these.\n\n377\n00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can turn all of these off.\n\n378\n00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,590\nIf you turn them all off,\nyou're not removing integration services.\n\n379\n00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,960\nYou still have integration services\nproviding the hardware access,\n\n380\n00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,940\ndriver acceleration, the mouse integration\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n381\n00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,980\n>> Like Ronnie mentioned.\n\n382\n00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,440\nThose things can't be turned off.\n\n383\n00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:07,950\n>> Yeah.\n\n384\n00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,121\n>> The only way to turn those off would\nbe to uninstall integration services, and\n\n385\n00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,869\nthat's not possible in Windows 7-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n386\n00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,792\n>> And higher and Server 2008 and higher.\n\n387\n00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,074\n>> Right.\n>> So so, you know,\n\n388\n00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:19,942\nwhile you don't need these, a lot of the\ncore functionality is enabled by default.\n\n389\n00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,540\n>> Right.\n>> You can't turn it off.\n\n390\n00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,530\nThese are just the ones that we\ncan disable if we don't need them.\n\n391\n00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,900\nFor most people,\nwe turn them all on and we leave it.\n\n392\n00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,420\n>> Yeah.\n\n393\n00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,280\n>> The, the exception for\nme is time synchronization.\n\n394\n00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,660\nI do disable that from time to time.\n\n395\n00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,925\nThe rest of them I typically leave on.\n\n396\n00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:32,425\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n397\n00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,190\n>> All right.\nSo, as far as configuration, or\n\n398\n00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,840\nconfiguring those settings,\nthat's really it.\n\n399\n00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> Turning them on or off, and,\n\n400\n00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,560\nand kind of being familiar\nwith what each one does.\n\n401\n00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,180\n>> Yeah.\n\n402\n00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,660\nMake sure, as you go back and study,\nyou do get into this feature here, and\n\n403\n00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,750\nyou do take a look at those settings.\n\n404\n00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,920\nKnowing where things are is\nhalf the battle on the exam.\n\n405\n00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,625\nGuarantee that.\n\n406\n00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So take a look and, and\n\n407\n00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,480\nmake sure you do figure that out.\n\n408\n00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,010\n>> Absolutely.\n\n409\n00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,872\n>> Yeah.\n\n410\n00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:58,280\n>> All right, well, Ronnie, I think that\npretty much covers the new Hyper-V stuff.\n\n411\n00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,310\nYou think of anything else?\n\n412\n00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,952\n>> I cannot think of anything else.\n\n413\n00:15:00,952 --> 00:15:03,500\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentleman,\nI hope you enjoyed the special.\n\n414\n00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,550\nStay tuned as we film\nmore of these to kind of\n\n415\n00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,130\nfill in-\n>> Right.\n\n416\n00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,590\n>> The gaps with the new stuff that\nwas added for the 2014 objectives.\n\n417\n00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,820\nSo-\n>> Sounds good.\n\n418\n00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,515\n>> Hope you enjoyed it, and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n419\n00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:18,784\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:36,084\n[LAUGH] Hello, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:38,137\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:41,203\nI'm your host Don Pezet today,\naccompanied by Mr Nate Copeland.\n\n7\n00:00:41,203 --> 00:00:41,923\nHow's it going Nate?\n\n8\n00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:43,061\n>> Going well Don, going well.\n\n9\n00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:44,186\nGlad to have you back, on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:45,347\n>> I tell you-\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n11\n00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:47,445\n>> I've been gone for a week, and\n\n12\n00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:50,607\nyou guys filmed like crazy,\nwhile I was gone.\n\n13\n00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:51,687\nDid all sorts of fun stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:52,348\n>> Yep.\n\n15\n00:00:52,348 --> 00:00:53,313\n>> No, I'm playing catch up.\n\n16\n00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:55,449\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So- [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:57,807\n>> Yep, well, glad you're back.\n\n18\n00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,947\nThat was nice, that we didn't have to\ngo pick you up out of the tank, or\n\n19\n00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:01,710\nanything that.\n\n20\n00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,427\nSo, that was nice.\n\n21\n00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:03,971\n>> Nobody had to pay bail.\n\n22\n00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:04,552\n>> Yeah.\n\n23\n00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:05,794\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n24\n00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:08,706\nSo, let me recap, although it\nshould probably be you recapping,\n\n25\n00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:09,906\nsince I wasn't even here.\n\n26\n00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:14,162\nBut while I was gone, we tackled\nsome Windows 8 stuff, and by we,\n\n27\n00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:15,758\nI mean you guys, not me.\n\n28\n00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:18,309\nAnd [LAUGH] you guys went crazy with it,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:21,626\nSo, you rolled out the client to a\nmachine, and then, you used ad blocker to\n\n30\n00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:24,361\nblock it off, and so, you got a chance\nto see a lot of that good stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:28,680\nToday, we're gonna continue on,\nwith our Windows 8 adventure.\n\n32\n00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,593\nAnd we've got just a little bit of stuff\nto wrap up from the last objectives,\n\n33\n00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,981\nbefore jumping into network configuration,\n\n34\n00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:37,690\nwhich is what we're really\ngonna focus in on today.\n\n35\n00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,460\n>> Yes, so two little points\nthat we are gonna touch on,\n\n36\n00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,761\nleft off from the last segment\nis configuring web sockets,\n\n37\n00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:51,062\nand configuring download manager.\n\n38\n00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:53,837\nBoth are with Internet Explorer.\n\n39\n00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:56,692\nAnd I guess, to start off we\ngot the web sockets, right Don?\n\n40\n00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:57,192\nSure.\n\n41\n00:01:57,192 --> 00:02:03,883\n>> So, if you're on Microsoft's website,\nand you start to read about web sockets,\n\n42\n00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:08,964\nthey portray it as being a [LAUGH]\nMicrosoft invention, right?\n\n43\n00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:10,394\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a new feature in\n\n44\n00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:13,840\nInternet Explorer, but what it actually\nis, it's a component of HTML5.\n\n45\n00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,928\nAnd if you've never heard of HTML5,\nit is the newest version of\n\n46\n00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:23,093\nthe Hypertext Markup Language, that is\nwhat powers the world wide web, right?\n\n47\n00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:24,346\nWhen you view a web page,\n\n48\n00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:27,888\nthe majority of that content represented\nto you is being sent in HTML.\n\n49\n00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:31,093\nHTML5 adds some really cool stuff.\n\n50\n00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:34,342\nAnd one of the coolest\nthings it allows us to do,\n\n51\n00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:37,522\nis to run applications\ninside of our browser.\n\n52\n00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:41,026\nAnd If you listen to marketing speak\nout there, like applications great,\n\n53\n00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:44,209\nwhen you're talking about Gmail,\nor Hotmail, that's garbage.\n\n54\n00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,007\nI'm talking about real applications, and\n\n55\n00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:50,115\nGoogle did a really cool\ndemonstration of this.\n\n56\n00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:51,241\nI don't know, if you ever saw it, Nate.\n\n57\n00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:56,725\nDid you see when they did Quake II,\ninside of a web browser?\n\n58\n00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,106\n>> No, I didn't.\n\n59\n00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,893\n>> Let me see,\nif I can find that real quick.\n\n60\n00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:06,061\nBut the key thing here, is not so\nmuch that it was Quake II, right?\n\n61\n00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,405\nThat's not what the technology\nwas developed for.\n\n62\n00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:08,926\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the fact,\n\n63\n00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:11,086\nthat it was done entirely\nin a web browser.\n\n64\n00:03:11,086 --> 00:03:15,184\nLet me see,\nif I can find something on YouTube.\n\n65\n00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:15,742\nHere we go.\n\n66\n00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,785\nI'll fire it up, on old YouTube.\n\n67\n00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:21,895\nBut basically, the Google developers\ndid it, just to show that they could.\n\n68\n00:03:21,895 --> 00:03:30,033\nLet me see, if I can get something\nbetter than 360p, for my quality here.\n\n69\n00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,229\nThat's awesome.\n\n70\n00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:35,633\nAnd this is actually the HTML5 player,\nthat I'm in right now.\n\n71\n00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,126\nSo, here we see,\nthey're on an OS X machine.\n\n72\n00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:43,855\nAnd so, they're showing that they're\nable to do this, inside of basically,\n\n73\n00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:44,710\na web system.\n\n74\n00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,252\nSo, here they're launching\nthe Quake game server.\n\n75\n00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:52,061\nAnd then, they're jumping over to Safari,\nwhich is an HTML5 browser.\n\n76\n00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,197\nAnd they're gonna browse to the webpage,\n\n77\n00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:56,521\nthey've made that hosts\ntheir Quake client.\n\n78\n00:03:56,521 --> 00:04:00,294\nAnd they're gonna run Quake,\nentirely inside of the web browser.\n\n79\n00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:04,268\nSo, there you see it's firing up,\nand they're mentioning there,\n\n80\n00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:07,017\nthat it's not the greatest\nthing in the world.\n\n81\n00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:09,001\nBut they're basically, firing it up, and\n\n82\n00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:12,551\nthey're getting where they can play\na video game, inside of the web browser.\n\n83\n00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:14,817\nThere we go.\n\n84\n00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:18,820\nThat is [COUGH] really\nwhat a web socket is.\n\n85\n00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,215\nIs this application, this Quake in\nthis case, is creating a TCP tunnel,\n\n86\n00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:28,839\nthrough the web browser,\nto that Quake server on the back end.\n\n87\n00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,428\nAnd allowing them to play the screen,\nand then apparently,\n\n88\n00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:33,170\nit is only rendering half of the screen.\n\n89\n00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,002\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, they've got some bugs to work out.\n\n90\n00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:37,733\nAll right.\nSo, it's not perfect, but they did it.\n\n91\n00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:41,495\nAnd this is what a web socket is.\n\n92\n00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:45,295\nA web socket allows these applications\nto run, and build connections.\n\n93\n00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:48,956\nSo, that means that HTML5,\nwhat we have in Internet Explorer 10,\n\n94\n00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,177\nthat's a part of Windows 8, is capable\nof creating these connections out, and\n\n95\n00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:56,301\nrunning all sorts of fun stuff,\ninside of the web browser.\n\n96\n00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,193\nNow-\n>> You had me at Quake II.\n\n97\n00:04:58,193 --> 00:04:58,936\n>> [LAUGH] Well, yeah.\n\n98\n00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:00,824\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've got a soft spot in my heart\n\n99\n00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:01,340\nfor Quake.\n\n100\n00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,611\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n101\n00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:05,794\nSo, I need to know this for the exam.\n\n102\n00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:07,247\nHow do I configure websites?\n\n103\n00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:08,849\nAnd the answer is you don't, right?\n\n104\n00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,310\nAnd you don't need to,\nfor the exam either.\n\n105\n00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,922\nWhat you need to know, is you need to\nbe aware that Internet Explorer 10 is\n\n106\n00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:20,261\nan HTML5 supported web browser, and\nit has support for web sockets.\n\n107\n00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:24,548\nAnd that means, that you can browse\nwebpages that have embedded applications,\n\n108\n00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:27,459\nand they'll run right there,\ninside of the browser.\n\n109\n00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,619\nIt is super awesome, super cool.\n\n110\n00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,117\n>> Awesome, sweet.\n\n111\n00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:32,000\nThat's a great example.\n\n112\n00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,638\nThanks, Don.\n\n113\n00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:34,762\nQuake II-\n>> It was the one that popped to my\n\n114\n00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:35,482\nmind first.\n\n115\n00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:38,417\nI've seen other ones that were legitimate\naccounting software, and stuff,\n\n116\n00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:39,000\nbut they suck.\n\n117\n00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,323\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Quake II, that's the way to go.\n\n118\n00:05:40,323 --> 00:05:41,980\n>> Yeah, right, Don.\n\n119\n00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,862\nAll right, yeah.\n\n120\n00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,046\nDownload manager, right?\n\n121\n00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:47,344\nSo, download manager,\nand Internet Explorer.\n\n122\n00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:52,873\nThere's not really a whole lot that we\ncan configure with download manager,\n\n123\n00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:56,371\nbut we can set where our\ndefault downloads go to.\n\n124\n00:05:56,371 --> 00:06:01,293\nAnd it could be convenient for some\nreasons, to have some control over that.\n\n125\n00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:05,403\nAnd I can show you on\nmy Internet Explorer.\n\n126\n00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:07,393\n>> Sure.\nWhile you're firing up, just real quick,\n\n127\n00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:10,153\nif you've never heard of the download\nmanager, you've probably used it, and\n\n128\n00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,694\njust didn't know, it actually had a name.\n\n129\n00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:13,016\nThat's kind of the camp, I fall into.\n\n130\n00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:17,259\nWhen you go into Internet Explorer,\nand you start to click on links to\n\n131\n00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:20,935\ndownload files, well,\nit'll do a background download.\n\n132\n00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,419\nSo, it's downloading those\nfiles in the background.\n\n133\n00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,625\nAnd you can download more than\none file at the same time.\n\n134\n00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:28,637\nIf your file gets interrupted while it's\ndownloading, it'll actually try, and\n\n135\n00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:31,173\nresume, it'll try, and\npick up where it left off.\n\n136\n00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:36,511\nBack in the day, I used to pay for\nsoftware called I paid it,\n\n137\n00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:39,707\nso I actually have it licensed, right?\n\n138\n00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:40,495\nSo, [INAUDIBLE] today.\n\n139\n00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:43,691\nAnd it was basically download manager\nfunctionality, and then back in the modem\n\n140\n00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:46,699\ndays, you didn't wanna have to\nre-download a file if it got interrupted,\n\n141\n00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,597\nyou wanted to resume.\n\n142\n00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:50,195\nThese days of high bandwidth,\nwe don't worry about it so much,\n\n143\n00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:53,288\nbut Internet Explorer does have it\nbuilt-in, with the download manager.\n\n144\n00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,389\nMost of us never configure it at all,\nright?\n\n145\n00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:57,409\nIt just runs, and it does it's thing.\n\n146\n00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,780\n>> Yep, sweet.\n\n147\n00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,553\n[COUGH] Now, yeah, to configure\ndownload manager, at least just change,\n\n148\n00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,840\nwhere our default directory goes.\n\n149\n00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,704\nIt is available through Internet Explorer,\nright through the options up there.\n\n150\n00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:14,012\nWe click that little gear,\nup at the top, and it drops down.\n\n151\n00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:16,288\nView downloads, right?\n\n152\n00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:20,061\nSo, this is our downloads history,\nthat we have here.\n\n153\n00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:22,708\nAnd right down there at the bottom,\nOptions.\n\n154\n00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,765\nClicking that, and there we go.\n\n155\n00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,204\nOur Download Options.\n\n156\n00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:29,327\nAnd this is the Default directory, we\ncould browse to something, and change it,\n\n157\n00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:32,751\nor else we can just dump everything\non the desktop, if we wanted to.\n\n158\n00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,528\nSo, there we go.\n\n159\n00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:37,628\nAnd so, now, everything that is\ndownloaded through Internet Explorer,\n\n160\n00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,787\nwill just get dumped onto our desktop.\n\n161\n00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:41,873\n>> And that's really about it, right?\n\n162\n00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:43,087\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's not really,\n\n163\n00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,874\nany other options there\non the download manager.\n\n164\n00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:48,534\nIt's enabled by default when you\nclick on a file, it gets kicked in.\n\n165\n00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,091\nIt is just a part of Internet Explorer, so\n\n166\n00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:54,685\nif you install Chrome or\nWhatever other browser you want.\n\n167\n00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:56,114\nThey have their own download managers.\n\n168\n00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:58,745\nThey don't use the Internet Explorer one.\n\n169\n00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,964\n>> Sweet.\nAll right,\n\n170\n00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:03,490\nI think that wraps up those\ntwo little topics, right?\n\n171\n00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,890\n>> Those are the last two little bits of,\nwhat was that objective?\n\n172\n00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,541\nOh, configuring Internet Explorer,\nso we got that knocked out, and now,\n\n173\n00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,565\nunless you've got anything else\nto add on Internet Explorer,\n\n174\n00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:16,374\naside from the fact that I don't\nthink either of us use it.\n\n175\n00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:17,867\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know Don.\n\n176\n00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:18,912\nTrue story.\n\n177\n00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,620\nI was a die-hard Internet Explorer guy.\n\n178\n00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,890\nAnd when I was taking classes, when I was\nstudying for stuff and getting ready,\n\n179\n00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,970\nI used Internet Explorer all the time for\neverything.\n\n180\n00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,770\nIf it's on the exam, then I should be\nfamiliar with it and with its quirks and\n\n181\n00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:40,270\nhow to fix things and everything, until I\nsaw you one day, I saw you using Chrome,\n\n182\n00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,115\nand I thought, oh man,\nit's okay to not use Internet Explorer.\n\n183\n00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:47,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I use Chrome at home.\n\n184\n00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,370\nBut I would just use it sparingly,\nI didn't want to get used to it.\n\n185\n00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,080\nSo yeah.\n\n186\n00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n187\n00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,450\n>> So now I hardly use it.\n\n188\n00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,490\n>> Now, Internet Explorer does still\nhave over 50% of the web browser market\n\n189\n00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,560\nshare out there, and that is because\nit is included with Windows.\n\n190\n00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,960\nSo a lot of people use it.\n\n191\n00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,480\nIt's a perfectly capable browser.\n\n192\n00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,310\nMicrosoft doesn't stay as\ncutting edge with it, so\n\n193\n00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,900\nthe HTML 5 stuff they were\na little slow to adopt.\n\n194\n00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,980\nAnd that's where Chrome and Firefox,\n\n195\n00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,210\nthey usually jump on those new\ntechnologies a little faster.\n\n196\n00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,100\nI like Chrome cuz of\nthe synchronization it does and stuff.\n\n197\n00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,981\nBut anyhow.\n\n198\n00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:24,257\nOn the exam, just Internet Explorer.\n\n199\n00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,260\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n200\n00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,370\nAll right, well, sweet.\n\n201\n00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:35,480\nMoving right along into our next\nbig topic, configuring IP settings.\n\n202\n00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,590\nAnd there are some sub objectives to that\none, which we'll, let me scroll down here.\n\n203\n00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,260\nYup, all right, so\nconfiguring name resolution, right?\n\n204\n00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,550\nConnect to a network,\nconfigure network locations, and\n\n205\n00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,658\nresolve connectivity issues, right?\n\n206\n00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:59,510\nSo now first, before jumping off, I think\ninstead of doing name resolution first,\n\n207\n00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,260\nwe're gonna do connect to a network.\n\n208\n00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I think that's kinda where\n\n209\n00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,310\neverything all stems from.\n\n210\n00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,560\n>> And pretty much these days,\nif you're using a computer,\n\n211\n00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,212\nit's going to be connected to a network,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:13,260\nTen, fifteen years ago, you might have\na standalone PC or a PC with a modem,\n\n213\n00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,770\nin which case you didn't have to\nmess with network connections.\n\n214\n00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,630\nToday, it's almost a guarantee.\n\n215\n00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,290\nAt a minimum,\n\n216\n00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,270\nyou're connecting to wireless\nnetworks at Starbucks or whatever.\n\n217\n00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,790\nAnd so, in order to communicate on those\nnetworks, you've gotta have an IP address,\n\n218\n00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,700\nyou've gotta have a default gateway,\nyou've gotta have DNS servers, and\n\n219\n00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,201\nit's got to be entered in, so\nwe need to know how to do that.\n\n220\n00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:33,248\n>> Yup.\n\n221\n00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:37,900\nYeah, those settings and\nsetting those settings up.\n\n222\n00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,379\n>> Setting those settings, wonderful.\n\n223\n00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,420\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n224\n00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,760\n>> It's available through the network and\nsharing center.\n\n225\n00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,135\nAnd I think the best way to connect\nto something is just fire it up and\n\n226\n00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:49,270\njust connect to something, right?\n\n227\n00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,460\n>> Absolutely.\n\n228\n00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,900\nYou wanna use your computer or mine?\n\n229\n00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,620\nWhichever.\n\n230\n00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,620\nI could-\n>> Why don't we use yours for IPv4, and\n\n231\n00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,920\nthen I'll use mine for IPv6.\n\n232\n00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,605\nWe'll swap around, how does that sound?\n\n233\n00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:00,230\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n234\n00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,280\nWe can share.\n\n235\n00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,800\n>> Right down there, right-click,\nopen Network and Sharing Center.\n\n236\n00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,230\nThere we go.\n>> And then you're right there.\n\n237\n00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,890\nSo, there's ten different ways\nto do anything in Windows.\n\n238\n00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,280\nThis is definitely the fastest, so\n\n239\n00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,465\nI wanted to make sure everybody\ngot a chance to see that.\n\n240\n00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n241\n00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,590\nYep.\nNow the part that we are going to play\n\n242\n00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,470\nwith, right, over here,\nChange Adapter Settings, and\n\n243\n00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,810\nclicking on that, and it brings up, right?\n\n244\n00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,320\nSo all of our different\nadapters that we have.\n\n245\n00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,950\nSo, Bluetooth adapter and\nthis ethernet network bridge and\n\n246\n00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,730\nthe vEthernet,\nall that kind of fun stuff, and for us,\n\n247\n00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,845\nwe're going to do this one.\n\n248\n00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:42,866\nAll right.\n\n249\n00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,968\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n250\n00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:47,340\nLet me back up a couple of steps.\n\n251\n00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,060\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n252\n00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,810\nNow we've just got one, right?\n\n253\n00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,400\nSo ethernet network.\n\n254\n00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,780\nAll right, and\nthis is our network interface card, right?\n\n255\n00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,930\nLittle connection that it has.\n\n256\n00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,090\nAnd double-clicking on it brings\nup our little status window.\n\n257\n00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,280\nAnd there's a Properties button here.\n\n258\n00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,200\nClicking on that, it'll bring up\nthe properties for this adapter.\n\n259\n00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,885\nAnd yada yada yada, all that other stuff.\n\n260\n00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:13,823\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And down here,\n\n261\n00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:18,280\nwe are looking at the TCP/IP version 4.\n\n262\n00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,190\nSelecting that to highlight and\n\n263\n00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,160\nclicking on Properties opens\nup its Properties screen.\n\n264\n00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,010\nRight now, it says obtain\nan IP address automatically.\n\n265\n00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,360\nNow this is for,\nwere you gonna say something Don?\n\n266\n00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,930\n>> No, no.\nI can.\n\n267\n00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,590\n>> Oh sorry.\n[LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,990\n>> I know what that means.\n\n269\n00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,446\n>> All right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n270\n00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:38,910\n>> So yeah,\n\n271\n00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,300\nobtain an IP address automatically.\n\n272\n00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,550\nThis is for DHCP, right?\n\n273\n00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,330\nSo this automatically configures things.\n\n274\n00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,180\nAnd we can also select use\nthe following IP address and\n\n275\n00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,940\nenter in our settings manually.\n\n276\n00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,130\nIf there is no DHCP server, so we cannot\nautomatically get our network settings,\n\n277\n00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,390\nwhich almost all the time\nit will be automatic.\n\n278\n00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,840\n>> You really do see that a lot.\n\n279\n00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,310\nDHCP, the Dynamic Host\nConfiguration Protocol,\n\n280\n00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,970\nmakes it where we don't\nhave to worry about IPs.\n\n281\n00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,140\nYou plug into the network, and\na DHCP server on the network,\n\n282\n00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,400\nwhich oftentimes is just your router or\naccess point, something like that,\n\n283\n00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,890\nwill give you an IP to use temporarily\nwhile you're on the network.\n\n284\n00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:22,150\nSo on workstations, laptops, tablets,\nphones, that's almost always what we use.\n\n285\n00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,540\nOn servers,\nwe almost always do static IPs, so\n\n286\n00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,450\nthat's where we need to come in here and\nchange it.\n\n287\n00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,520\nBut for\nthe exam we need to know both ways.\n\n288\n00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,530\nSo if you don't have a DHCP server,\nNate's showing you the exact way.\n\n289\n00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,340\n>> And without getting into\na whole lot of back stuff,\n\n290\n00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,510\nyou know\n>> We can't just use any IP address.\n\n291\n00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,230\nWe just can't plug in any numbers and\nhave it work.\n\n292\n00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,100\nWell, you can plug in any numbers,\nbut it won't-\n\n293\n00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,600\n>> It won't work.\n\n294\n00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,780\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, won't work.\n\n295\n00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,295\nIt won't connect anywhere outside,\nor even on the network, so\n\n296\n00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:56,740\nthere are certain IP addresses that need\nto be used and subnet masks and gateways.\n\n297\n00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,830\nMost of the time, your network\nadministrator will have that information\n\n298\n00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,805\nto plug in or\nit will be pushed out with DHCP.\n\n299\n00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:11,425\nBut for\nus we're just gonna enter it in manually.\n\n300\n00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:14,270\n>> Yeah, and when you punch in an address,\n\n301\n00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,800\nat a minimum, you need an IP address and\na subnet mask, all right?\n\n302\n00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,180\nThat's the bare minimum.\n\n303\n00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,740\nThat will allow you to communicate with\nother people on the same network as\n\n304\n00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,290\nyou and that's it.\n\n305\n00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,560\nIf you want to be able to communicate\nto other networks that are out there,\n\n306\n00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,430\nyou'll also need a default gateway.\n\n307\n00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,960\nBut a lot of people don't realize\nthat default gateway is actually\n\n308\n00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,710\nan optional setting.\n\n309\n00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,790\nYou don't have to put it in there.\n\n310\n00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,780\nIf you're not gonna talk to other systems\non the network, you can leave it blank.\n\n311\n00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,420\nAnd then lastly we've got our DNS servers,\nthat's the domain naming system, and\n\n312\n00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,620\nif we wanna be able to do name resolution,\ntype in www.microsoft.com and\n\n313\n00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,330\nget an IP, for example, then you're\ngoing to need a DNS server also.\n\n314\n00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,200\n>> All right,\nnow I entered in just some numbers, right?\n\n315\n00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,205\nA class C address.\n\n316\n00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:02,802\n192.168.\nIt's a pretty common one in the house,\n\n317\n00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:06,070\nso I've entered in my connection.\n\n318\n00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,520\nWe can fire up your Internet Explorer,\nright?\n\n319\n00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,890\nAnd it does not work, right?\n\n320\n00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,930\nIt doesn't work, so\nthese IP settings that I put in aren't for\n\n321\n00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,925\nthe network that we're on.\n\n322\n00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:16,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n323\n00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,760\n>> So we could go back into the internet\nconnection properties, and key it in.\n\n324\n00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,100\nOr, we can use the command\nline with the Netsh command,\n\n325\n00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,970\nand we can set our address that way.\n\n326\n00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,190\n>> Now, I'll tell you,\n\n327\n00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,810\nin real life land, you're not really gonna\nuse the command line for this stuff.\n\n328\n00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,131\nBut it does show up on the exam, so\n\n329\n00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:39,600\nwe wanna make sure you guys\nare familiar with it and you see it.\n\n330\n00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,952\nTo give you a real life example where\nyou would use the command line is if you\n\n331\n00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:46,160\nwanted to something like this\nprogrammatically or through a script.\n\n332\n00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,880\nSo, for example, you had an image that\nyou are gonna be rolling out to machines.\n\n333\n00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,110\nYou have 1,000 machines to deploy.\n\n334\n00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,390\nYou might write a script that,\nas the machines boot up,\n\n335\n00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,280\nit checks their host name and applies\na particular IP address to that host name.\n\n336\n00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,870\nRemember something in that nature, right?\n\n337\n00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:04,190\nSo, that's an example where you\nmight use in real life land.\n\n338\n00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,395\nFor right now though, we can always drop\nto a command prompt and assign an IP and\n\n339\n00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:09,840\nNate's going to do it.\n\n340\n00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,660\n>> Yep, let me just make\nthis just a slightly larger.\n\n341\n00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,750\n>> Now he's going to use\nthe Net SH command and\n\n342\n00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,290\nthat's the one you need to know for\nthe exam.\n\n343\n00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,580\nWe can also use the power\nshell to assign an IP, but\n\n344\n00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,670\nit is really a lot more complex when\nyou start to use the Power Shell.\n\n345\n00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,390\nAnd it is designed for software to be\nable to use that to assign the IPs.\n\n346\n00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,970\nThat one you don't need to know\nthe commands for the exam, but\n\n347\n00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,960\nyou just need to be familiar with\nthe fact that you could do that.\n\n348\n00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,541\nYou could use the Power Shell\nto assign an IP address.\n\n349\n00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,740\n>> Um-hm, yep.\n\n350\n00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,790\nAlright, well, sweet.\n\n351\n00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,390\nWell, you know we can't get\nthe internet on this machine, right, so\n\n352\n00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,740\nour IP settings are incorrect, and let's\nenter some settings and make it correct.\n\n353\n00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,650\nCheck to see if it works.\n\n354\n00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:00,867\nAlright, so we will use the Net Sh\ncommand, all right, NETSH,\n\n355\n00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:06,895\nand then interface and IPv4, right,\nthat's what we are working with.\n\n356\n00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And what do we want to do with it?\n\n357\n00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,280\nWe want to set address.\n\n358\n00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,819\nAll right, now we need to tell it\nwhich interface we're working with,\n\n359\n00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,539\nall right, so it's name equals and\nlet's find the name.\n\n360\n00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:27,671\n>> That's always the pain having to\nfind out the name of the adapter or\n\n361\n00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,665\nits unique id, or whatever.\n\n362\n00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:30,210\n>> Um-hm.\n\n363\n00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,361\n>> So up here, right, so\n\n364\n00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:35,790\nI've pulled up the properties it says\nunidentified network, private network.\n\n365\n00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:40,520\nAnd this is our network but\nit is not the name we're looking for.\n\n366\n00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,070\nThe name for it, right, and\nthe change adapter settings, that one.\n\n367\n00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,378\nEthernet, so\nthat is the name that we want.\n\n368\n00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:54,680\nEthernet, all right, and\nthen we need to give it a address.\n\n369\n00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,962\nWhich is just addr, and\nwe're gonna change it to\n\n370\n00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:04,098\n10.1, and\n\n371\n00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:09,870\ndot what, Don, what do you think,\n20, 22, 50, 100?\n\n372\n00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,410\n>> Pick a high number, pick like 211.\n\n373\n00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,640\nThat should be available.\n\n374\n00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,170\n>> All right, and\nthen we have mass 08, wait.\n\n375\n00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,440\n>> No, no, alright, you're fine.\n\n376\n00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,295\nWe're guessing on an IP that's not taken\non the network, which is not necessarily\n\n377\n00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:26,834\nthe best network etiquette, but\nI'm pretty certain that IP is available.\n\n378\n00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:30,628\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, now I have to set the subnet\n\n379\n00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:34,519\nmask, right, and zero, which,\n\n380\n00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:39,615\nDon is the network admin, so\nI guess is that good, Don?\n\n381\n00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:40,543\n>> Yes.\n>> Is that correct one?\n\n382\n00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:41,437\n>> Yep.\n\n383\n00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:46,759\n>> Alright, and\nthen we have a gateway, all right,\n\n384\n00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:52,123\nand the gateway would be 10.1.230.0?\n\n385\n00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:53,165\nYes.\n\n386\n00:18:58,168 --> 00:18:59,696\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> No, 230.1.\n\n387\n00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:00,386\n>> .1.\n\n388\n00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:01,248\n>> Sorry.\n\n389\n00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:02,640\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n390\n00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,480\nAnd there we go.\n\n391\n00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,533\n>> Now, was that easier that\ndoing it through the GUI?\n\n392\n00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,381\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely not.\n\n393\n00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,941\n[LAUGH] But it is able,\n\n394\n00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:16,465\nby being a command like this you\ncan put it in a script, right?\n\n395\n00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:19,699\nYou can't put right click and\nchoose properties in a script but\n\n396\n00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:22,943\nyou can put a command like that and\nthen this H command in there.\n\n397\n00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:24,742\nCan you verify the settings took effect,\nNate?\n\n398\n00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,250\nIt's thinking.\n\n399\n00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,230\n>> It's thinking.\n\n400\n00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,496\n>> While it's waiting,\nwhy don't you go into the GUI and\n\n401\n00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:38,414\npull up the properties from the card,\nand it should reflect it there.\n\n402\n00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:44,260\nWatch, that 211 IP will be\none that's already in use.\n\n403\n00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,260\nBut yep, you an see right there\nwhere it's got the 230.211 address,\n\n404\n00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,520\nit's got the gateway set.\n\n405\n00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,830\n>> It's not working.\n\n406\n00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,110\n>> No DNS server,\nyeah that will be a problem.\n\n407\n00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,320\n>> Yeah let's change that.\n\n408\n00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,240\n>> So good point there,\nfrom Net SH he set an IP address,\n\n409\n00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,130\na subnet mask, a default gateway,\nhe did not set a DNS server.\n\n410\n00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,686\nSo, we still have the bad DNS servers\nin there, so he's just gonna punch in,\n\n411\n00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,514\nthat's one of Google's DNS servers.\n\n412\n00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,720\nAnd that should take care of that.\n\n413\n00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,405\n>> Here we go.\n\n414\n00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:20,286\n>> Sweet, with four sentenced to death,\nexcellent.\n\n415\n00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:24,926\nSo, [LAUGH] there's never positive\nnews in any of these web pages, but\n\n416\n00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:26,824\nyes, so that gives us line.\n\n417\n00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:31,860\n>> Um-hm, yep, so the Net SH command,\nit can do a lot of different things,\n\n418\n00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,830\nit would be beneficial to be familiar\nwith some of the commands it can do.\n\n419\n00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:43,020\nPoke around, one thing I have learned that\ntrying to get used to the command line and\n\n420\n00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,170\ndoing things is, simple tasks,\nlike changing IP address to just almost\n\n421\n00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:54,550\nforce myself to use the command line\nstuff, and I don't remember the syntax or\n\n422\n00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,180\nright switches to use, and so\nit's a way to really reinforce\n\n423\n00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,370\nthose things by wanting to use it\nlike using Internet Explorer, right?\n\n424\n00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,430\nUse it all the time no matter what and\nyou know, it will sink in and\n\n425\n00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,880\nit will be second nature before no time.\n\n426\n00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,410\n>> Yep, repetition really is\nthe key to learning and stuff.\n\n427\n00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,690\nNow, we had a question in the chat.\n\n428\n00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,470\nI mentioned how the Power Shell is much\nmore difficult to set one of these\n\n429\n00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,550\noptions.\n\n430\n00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,525\nBut, they, they ask how do we do it,\ncuz they always do it.\n\n431\n00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:24,190\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n432\n00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,000\n>> So, I've pulled up the Microsoft\nlittle technet article on it that they\n\n433\n00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,230\ngave the outline in, so I've got to\npull up here on my machine the script.\n\n434\n00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,120\nAnd basically with PowerShell\nyou don't really run commands.\n\n435\n00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,690\nYou create a script file and\nyou run the script file.\n\n436\n00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,120\nSo I've got a real simple script file.\n\n437\n00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,310\nThis is right off the technet\nwhere basically you have to\n\n438\n00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,200\nquery the Windows management\ninstrumentation interface, the WMI.\n\n439\n00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,360\nYou have to query it to pull\nup your network adapter and\n\n440\n00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,320\nthen you set here the turning on a static\nand assigning the IP and subnet mask.\n\n441\n00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,420\nThen they're setting the gateways and\nsetting the DNS server.\n\n442\n00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,890\nSo it's kinda of a convoluted\nprocess there of calling and\n\n443\n00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,620\nsetting all these variables, but\nit can be done from the PowerShell.\n\n444\n00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,250\nThe Netsh command, it was a long command,\nbut it was just one command.\n\n445\n00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,130\nIn the PowerShell, it's multiple\ncommands that have to be called cuz\n\n446\n00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,120\nyou're modifying the settings\nthrough the WMI.\n\n447\n00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,946\nSo it's much more programmatic, it's much\nmore what a developer would use than what\n\n448\n00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:20,172\na network admin would ever encounter.\n\n449\n00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,130\n>> Um-hm, yep.\n\n450\n00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,040\nAlright, you there's, yeah, yeah.\n\n451\n00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,150\nI had a thought but it slipped.\n\n452\n00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,616\n>> I got you off your train of thought.\n\n453\n00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,780\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n454\n00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,791\n>> So that's IPV4, right,\nthe internet protocol version 4.\n\n455\n00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,414\n>> Yep.\n>> Which is what everybody uses just\n\n456\n00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:40,500\nabout.\n\n457\n00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,460\nThere's also Internet\nprotocol version six, right?\n\n458\n00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,970\n>> Yeah, IPV 6, that's what's\ntaking over the reigns from IPV 4.\n\n459\n00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,090\nAnd while we see it in\nlimited release now,\n\n460\n00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:57,460\nreally in the next five to seven years, we\nshould see a major switch over to IPV 6,\n\n461\n00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,370\nwhere IPV 4 becomes\nthe less common protocol.\n\n462\n00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,352\nFortunately, it, well let's\nstart with the unfortunate side.\n\n463\n00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:10,112\nUnfortunately, IPV6 addresses are much,\nmuch bigger, and much more complex, right?\n\n464\n00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:15,570\nAnd IPV4 address is a 32 bit number,\nand IPV6 address is 128 bits.\n\n465\n00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,460\nIt's much much longer, right, you're\nnot going to be able to remember them.\n\n466\n00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,240\nWell, on a positive side,\nthat means we are going to be using DHCP.\n\n467\n00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,050\nIn IPV6 you don't really have DHCP,\nyou have network discovery.\n\n468\n00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,020\nBut anyhow without digging in to the nitty\ngritty, you use automatic address\n\n469\n00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:37,240\nassignment a lot more in IPV6 so we really\ndon't have to worry about the addresses.\n\n470\n00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,311\nBut what if we want to assign\na static IPV6 address?\n\n471\n00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:44,280\nFortunately, it's basically\nthe same processes.\n\n472\n00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,872\nSo on my machine I'm gonna\ngo back into that network.\n\n473\n00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:50,100\nIn sharing center where Nate\nwas just a few minutes ago.\n\n474\n00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,445\nAnd when I go into my network and\nsharing center, so if I go in here and\n\n475\n00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:57,163\nI change my adapter settings and\nI take one of my network adaptors, right?\n\n476\n00:23:57,163 --> 00:24:01,668\nSo I'll take local area connection\ntwo here, and I'll try and\n\n477\n00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:03,460\npull up its properties.\n\n478\n00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,420\nSo this is the same screen that\nNate was on a few moments ago.\n\n479\n00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,260\nIn this list, you're seeing all the\ndifferent protocols that are attached to\n\n480\n00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,350\nour network adapter and most of these\nwe never need to configure, right?\n\n481\n00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,940\nClient for Microsoft networks.\n\n482\n00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,350\nThat's what lets us\nfind network shares and\n\n483\n00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,070\nnetwork printers in\na Microsoft environment.\n\n484\n00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,070\nYou just turn it on,\nyou don't really tweak it.\n\n485\n00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,430\nNotice how when I have it highlighted,\n\n486\n00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,590\nthat Properties button\ndoesn't even light up.\n\n487\n00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,730\nThe quality of service packet scheduler,\nthat's what's making sure that things like\n\n488\n00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,720\nvideo streaming are getting the best\nquality possible on your laptop.\n\n489\n00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,140\nAgain, not something\nthat we can configure,\n\n490\n00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,110\nthe Properties button doesn't light up.\n\n491\n00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,020\nFile and printer sharing, again, part\nof that client for Microsoft networks.\n\n492\n00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,660\nThis what actually handles\nthe communications for file and\n\n493\n00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,840\nprinter sharing.\n\n494\n00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,430\nMicrosoft network adapter\nmultiplexer protocol, right?\n\n495\n00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,890\nIf you have more than one network\nadapter you can bond them together,\n\n496\n00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,660\nthey call it multiplexing.\n\n497\n00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,470\nThis is the function that does that.\n\n498\n00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,056\nI don't, or at least I'm not using that,\nso it's turned off by default.\n\n499\n00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:07,819\nMost people don't have more\nthan one network adapter.\n\n500\n00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:10,288\nLLDP, the Link Layer Discovery Protocol,\n\n501\n00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:14,850\nthat's what we use in IPv6 to be able\nto find other machines on the network.\n\n502\n00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,840\nAgain, no properties but on that one.\n\n503\n00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,450\nSo see, most of this stuff, these\nprotocols we don't have to mess with.\n\n504\n00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,150\nBut as we get down towards the bottom,\nTCPIP version 4,\n\n505\n00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,600\nwe had that Properties\nbutton where Nate went to.\n\n506\n00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,880\nTCPIP version 6,\nwe also have that Properties button.\n\n507\n00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,220\nAnd so we just dive in there and\n\n508\n00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,810\nthe screen is not much\ndifferent than IPv4, right?\n\n509\n00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,180\nIt does default to automatic address\nassignment cuz that's really what\n\n510\n00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,720\nwe want with IPv6.\n\n511\n00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,710\nThe addresses are just so long.\n\n512\n00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,270\nThere's a joke to be found there.\n\n513\n00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:48,680\nAnd then, if we wanted to,\nwe can jump over to a static and\n\n514\n00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,480\nwe can punch in our 128-bit address so\n\n515\n00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,620\nI might have one that is nice.\n\n516\n00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,300\nI'm gonna get bored just typing.\n\n517\n00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,030\n>> I just do them colon, colon one.\n\n518\n00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,890\n>> I suppose I could do that.\n\n519\n00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,129\nThere we go.\n\n520\n00:26:09,129 --> 00:26:10,688\nAnd we define our subnet mask.\n\n521\n00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:14,519\nNow subnet masks and\nIPv6 aren't defined as 255, 255 whatever,\n\n522\n00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,530\ncuz they'd be really long, so they just\ncut to the chase and go with the bits,\n\n523\n00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,800\nhow many bits are in the network ID.\n\n524\n00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,499\nSo I'll say 64.\n\n525\n00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,345\nAnd then I can punch\nin my default gateway.\n\n526\n00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:28,975\nAgain, default gateway gets\ndiscovered with IPv6 by default,\n\n527\n00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:30,755\nthat's the default part of that.\n\n528\n00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:35,382\nBut maybe for me it's 55 and then I\ncan punch in my DNS servers and so on.\n\n529\n00:26:35,382 --> 00:26:39,332\nSo just like IPv4, we statically\nput these entries in here and\n\n530\n00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:40,502\nthen we're in business, right?\n\n531\n00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:43,762\nAnd so, if I set that right now,\nI'll just set that.\n\n532\n00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:50,026\nAnd then drop into a command prompt,\nwhich has a microscopic font.\n\n533\n00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:52,046\nSame problem you had.\n\n534\n00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,793\nLet me bump that one up real quick.\n\n535\n00:26:58,705 --> 00:26:59,356\nThere we go.\n\n536\n00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:00,844\nNow we'll blow out our retinas\n\n537\n00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:13,662\nOkay, so now when I go in here and I start\nto look at my adaptors I can find it and\n\n538\n00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,958\nhere's my adaptor that\nhas that IPv6 address.\n\n539\n00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:20,831\nI can see 2001:3c:abcd, right?\n\n540\n00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:22,350\nThat's where I started getting bored.\n\n541\n00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,570\nAnd [LAUGH] so\nwe can see that big address down here.\n\n542\n00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,740\nI can see my default gateways and\nI've got my IPv4 default gateway and\n\n543\n00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,430\nnow I have an IPv6 default gateway\nalso which is not a real machine, but\n\n544\n00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,750\njust an IP that I made up.\n\n545\n00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,425\nSo all of that stuff makes it in there,\njust like IP before.\n\n546\n00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,250\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\n\n547\n00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,850\nSweet, yep and there we go.\n\n548\n00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,281\n>> Easy as that.\n\n549\n00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:48,072\nAll right, well Nate we're running\na little low on time for this segment and\n\n550\n00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:49,960\nthat's a pretty good\nstopping point right there.\n\n551\n00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,865\nWe've see the signing IPs for IPv4 and\nIPv6, we saw Command Line and GUI, so\n\n552\n00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:56,510\npretty good stuff there.\n\n553\n00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,340\nWe've got more excitement and\nadventure on our agenda.\n\n554\n00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,220\nWe still have connectivity issues,\n\n555\n00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,340\nalthough we kind of already saw that on\nyours, and then other network settings.\n\n556\n00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,290\nDo you have anything else\nto throw in before break?\n\n557\n00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:09,971\n>> No, we're good.\n\n558\n00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:13,071\n>> Okay, let's take a break then and\nwe'll see you guys back in a few minutes.\n\n559\n00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:18,554\n[MUSIC]\n\n560\n00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:20,434\n[MUSIC]\n\n561\n00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:23,498\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n562\n00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:26,391\nSo before the break,\nwe setup some IP addresses and\n\n563\n00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:29,320\nwe got a chance to see\nbasic network connectivity.\n\n564\n00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,355\nNow we're gonna go a step further and\ntake a deeper look at DNS.\n\n565\n00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:34,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n566\n00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,350\nYou know what, Don?\n\n567\n00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,285\nI just thought of something.\n\n568\n00:28:36,285 --> 00:28:37,090\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n569\n00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,450\n>> I just thought of something that we\ncould cover on the network settings,\n\n570\n00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,040\nthe IPv4 stuff and the IPv6.\n\n571\n00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,650\n>> Okay.\n\n572\n00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,150\n>> Right.\n>> Are we gonna regret this?\n\n573\n00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,074\n>> What?\nNo, no, no.\n\n574\n00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:50,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's another tab in\n\n575\n00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,320\nthere of alternate configuration.\n\n576\n00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,940\nWe kinda glossed over that, right?\n\n577\n00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,490\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n578\n00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,990\nYou have it with IPv4, not IPv6.\n\n579\n00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,275\nJust IPv4.\n\n580\n00:28:58,275 --> 00:28:59,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n581\n00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,998\n>> Yeah.\n\n582\n00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:01,577\n>> Just throwing out\nanother piece of knowledge.\n\n583\n00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:06,670\n[LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, so if a computer does not find\n\n584\n00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,190\na DHCP server, right?\n\n585\n00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:15,860\nTo automatically get its stuff,\nWindows 8 will auto configure itself.\n\n586\n00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:23,490\nNow, there is a default, a standard,\nAPIPA, what would you call that?\n\n587\n00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,938\n>> The default network it uses or?\n\n588\n00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:30,450\n>> Yeah, so APIPA,\nif there's no DHCP server,\n\n589\n00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:36,115\nthen it uses automatic IP\naddress signing something.\n\n590\n00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:37,860\nA PIPA, right?\n\n591\n00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:44,230\nAnd so it automatically configures\nitself to a 169254 address, right?\n\n592\n00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,140\nNow, we can set that.\n\n593\n00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,960\nRight?\nWe can set it to where instead of using\n\n594\n00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,710\nthe 169254 address we can set it to\nwhere if it does not find a DHCP server,\n\n595\n00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,420\nit will default to this other address.\n\n596\n00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,595\nWhich could be helpful if your business or\n\n597\n00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:05,225\nplace where you take your laptop and\nthere's no DHCP\n\n598\n00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:08,955\nserver then it would automatically\nconfigure to your network settings.\n\n599\n00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:11,455\nYou take your computer home and\nyou're on a different network,\n\n600\n00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:16,380\ndifferent network settings, and it does\nfind DHCP, then it would default to that.\n\n601\n00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,720\n>> All right, so let's take a look\nat this in the actual settings.\n\n602\n00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,040\nIt does get a little confusing.\n\n603\n00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,270\nThere's actually two different\nmethods to get an address\n\n604\n00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,158\nif your DHCP server is not available or\nnot function, right?\n\n605\n00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:32,260\nNate mentioned a APIPA, and we throw\nthe term out, it's around a long time.\n\n606\n00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:40,250\nAPIPA is the Automatic, Private,\nIP or Internet Protocol Addressing.\n\n607\n00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,590\nSo APIPA is a little service that runs\nin the background in Windows and says\n\n608\n00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,750\nif I try to find a DHCP server that's not\nthere, I'll just make up my own address.\n\n609\n00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,470\nScrew it, I'll come up with my own!\n\n610\n00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,947\nAnd it comes up, just like Nate said,\n\n611\n00:30:54,947 --> 00:31:00,532\nan address that starts with\n169.254 dot something.\n\n612\n00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:06,010\nAnd it's a class B address, so\nall the other computers on your\n\n613\n00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,710\nnetwork that might be coming up with\n169.254 addresses can see each other, but\n\n614\n00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,340\nthey don't have a default gateway, right?\n\n615\n00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,370\nThat's the real problem with a APIPA,\nis if you get that automatic private\n\n616\n00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,150\nIP address it has no default gateway,\nyou can only talk to local machines.\n\n617\n00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,780\nSo the alternative that Nate mentioned,\nthat's what I want to show you,\n\n618\n00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,170\nI'm gonna pull up my network and\n\n619\n00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:29,040\nsharing center here, and\nI'm going to go into my adapter settings.\n\n620\n00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,193\nAnd I'll pull up one of my adaptors and\n\n621\n00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:37,320\nwhen you go in here and\nyou pull up IP version 4.\n\n622\n00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,300\nSo I'll go to IP version 4 and\nI'll pull up properties.\n\n623\n00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,053\nRight here I'm separate DHCP.\n\n624\n00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:47,720\nIf the DCHP server is not there,\nI will use APIPA and\n\n625\n00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,609\ngenerate a 169 254 address, or\nI can specify an alternate configuration,\n\n626\n00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:57,876\nhere's that tab and\nif I go into alternate configuration,\n\n627\n00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:02,139\nright here I can say okay,\nif you don't find a DHCP server,\n\n628\n00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:07,180\ninstead of using Apipa,\nlet's go ahead and manually set one.\n\n629\n00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,430\nThe advantage here is we can define\nDNS servers and a default gateway.\n\n630\n00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,350\nSo we might be able to be fully\nfunctional in the event the DHP\n\n631\n00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,440\nserver is not available.\n\n632\n00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,140\nSo kind of a cool thing.\n\n633\n00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,920\nReally it's another thing we might use\nmore on a server than on a desktop\n\n634\n00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,040\nor a laptop.\n\n635\n00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,160\nBut it can be useful if\nyou don't have DHCP.\n\n636\n00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,990\nAnd then what I mentioned at the very\nbeginning was that this was an IP\n\n637\n00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,470\nversion four thing.\n\n638\n00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,590\nIf we take a look at IP version 6, so\nI'll just take TCPIP version 6 here.\n\n639\n00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:41,020\nNotice I don't even have a tab\nthat alternate configuration.\n\n640\n00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,180\nIPV6 does not need something like a pipa\n\n641\n00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,760\nbecause with IPV6 you have what\nare called link local addresses.\n\n642\n00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,390\nAnd they're pretty easy to spot.\n\n643\n00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,610\nLet me bring mine up.\n\n644\n00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,280\nWell, they're pretty easy to spot\nif the screen is not microscopic.\n\n645\n00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,800\nBut you can see this address here,\nFE80 blah blah blah.\n\n646\n00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,480\nAny IPV6 address that starts with FE8,\n\n647\n00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,256\nthat is a link-local address that\nis designed for local use only.\n\n648\n00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,170\nIf your DACP server'is not functional, or\n\n649\n00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,390\nyou're not discovering an address, you\ncommunicate just fine with one of these.\n\n650\n00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,250\nSo you don't need APIPA.\n\n651\n00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,230\n>> Sweet.\n\n652\n00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,070\n>> Yep.\nSo yeah.\n\n653\n00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,000\nI just remembered that.\n\n654\n00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,140\nGood deal.\n>> Good knowledge to have, right?\n\n655\n00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,690\n>> Yep.\n\n656\n00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,210\nAll right, so\nmoving forward with all of this.\n\n657\n00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,760\nSo we've got IP addresses,\nand that's nice.\n\n658\n00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,170\nWe need those, but trying to remember\neverybody's IP address on your network\n\n659\n00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,820\nto do things and\nstuff may not be the easiest.\n\n660\n00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,950\nSo we have Host names.\n\n661\n00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,550\nSo we can find things,\nresources on the network by using names.\n\n662\n00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:51,671\n>> Yeah so, if you want to, if you want to\ncome see our website, you go to http://.\n\n663\n00:33:51,671 --> 00:33:52,713\nAnd you don't even really need that.\n\n664\n00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:55,780\nAnd then you go to itpro.tv, right?\n\n665\n00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,840\nYou don't need to know\nwhat our IP address is.\n\n666\n00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,080\nYou just punch in that name.\n\n667\n00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,590\nWay easier to remember itpro.tv than\nit is to remember our full address,\n\n668\n00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,420\nwhich honestly, now that I think about it,\n\n669\n00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,180\nI don't even know and\nI'm the one who set it up.\n\n670\n00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,960\nSo that just goes to show you right\nthere that some of us don't really know.\n\n671\n00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,630\nSo there it is.\n\n672\n00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:20,172\nSo our external IP is 173.255.227.128.\n\n673\n00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:21,130\nAll right.\n\n674\n00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,756\nGreat.\n\n675\n00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:23,530\nI don't have that memorized.\n\n676\n00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,910\nNone of us are really going to do that.\n\n677\n00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:28,320\nSo we rely on DNS servers to\ntake care of that for us.\n\n678\n00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,760\nIf you're using DHCP, you get your DNS\nservers from the DHCP server or like\n\n679\n00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,800\nwe showed in the last segment, you can go\nin and manually set them, right, and then\n\n680\n00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,405\nyou can say I'm going to use this server\nto resolve my names and be in business.\n\n681\n00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:42,170\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n682\n00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,570\nYep.\nNow, as far as the,\n\n683\n00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,095\nlike, The client side, right?\n\n684\n00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:45,630\n>> Um-hm.\n\n685\n00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,490\n>> So, DNS stuff, there's not really a\nwhole heck of a lot, if it breaks, there's\n\n686\n00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:56,270\nnot a whole lot that we can do on this\nWindows 8 client level to repair things.\n\n687\n00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:56,990\nRight?\n\n688\n00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,980\n>> Yeah, I mean, you can troubleshoot.\n\n689\n00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,110\nAnd identify whether it's\na problem on your side.\n\n690\n00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,030\nWhat are some of the problems we can have?\n\n691\n00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,560\nWe might have the wrong DNS server\nIP addresses put in, right?\n\n692\n00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,840\nSo it you're looking at the wrong server,\nthat might cause a problem.\n\n693\n00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,380\n>> Like when I entered my stuff in, right?\n\n694\n00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,005\nIn the virtual machine.\n\n695\n00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:15,840\n>> Yeah, you did the 192.168.10 address,\nwhich was fake.\n\n696\n00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,690\nThat didn't work.\n\n697\n00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,400\nSo, how can we test that?\n\n698\n00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,490\nThere's really two things that I do,\nright?\n\n699\n00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,950\nLet me make my DOS prompt bigger here.\n\n700\n00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,220\nI shouldn't call it a DOS\nprompt cuz it's not DOS, right?\n\n701\n00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,650\nLet me make my command prompt bigger.\n\n702\n00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,290\n>> There you go.\n\n703\n00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:34,050\n>> That's what Microsoft\nwants us to call it.\n\n704\n00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:38,380\nIf we succumb to the man,\nthat's what the man wants us to call it.\n\n705\n00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,742\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so if I go in here,\n\n706\n00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:45,610\nthe first command I usually use when\ntroubleshooting DNS is simply ping.\n\n707\n00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:51,380\nIf I try and ping itpro.tv,\nI should get an IP address.\n\n708\n00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:57,630\nAnd I can see right there,\npining itpro.tv 173.255.227.128.\n\n709\n00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:03,370\nOkay, if I tried to ping something\nthat didn't exist, right?\n\n710\n00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,127\nThen I would get something like this,\ncould not find host ITPro.tv zero,\n\n711\n00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:12,630\nit's not real, so I get a message\nsaying that it can't resolve it,\n\n712\n00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,950\nso there's our problem and\nI know that I had a DNS failure.\n\n713\n00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,810\nNow my problem here isn't\nwith the DNS server itself,\n\n714\n00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,620\nmy problem is with the name\nthat I typed in, right.\n\n715\n00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,300\nI got a typo.\n\n716\n00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,810\nSo that's kinda my first go to guy\nwhen it comes to troubleshooting DNS.\n\n717\n00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,190\nThe second tool is nslookup.\n\n718\n00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,950\n>> Yep.\n\n719\n00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:36,770\n>> I like nslookup because you\ncan say nslookup itpro.tv and\n\n720\n00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,390\nyou can run that, it will show you\nwhether or not it's resolving, and\n\n721\n00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,140\nwhat server it was that told us.\n\n722\n00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,600\nSo I can see that gnv-dc01\nis a DNS server, and\n\n723\n00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,247\nit's the one that told me\nwhat that ip address it was.\n\n724\n00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:53,910\nBut if that server is not\nreturning an answer, right?\n\n725\n00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,870\nSo if it's returning back and\nsaying nonexistent domain,\n\n726\n00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,070\nit couldn't find the answer, right?\n\n727\n00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,600\nNslookup let's us test\nwith other DNS servers.\n\n728\n00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,310\nSo if I wanted to test with Google,\nI could add 8.8.8.8 to the end,\n\n729\n00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:11,850\nand that says, do this DNS lookup but\ndo it against Google's server.\n\n730\n00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,740\nAnd so I can try that.\n\n731\n00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,670\nSame issue.\n\n732\n00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,240\nWell, then I can try somebody else.\n\n733\n00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,570\nLike I'll try GE.\n\n734\n00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:21,170\nSo, we'll put in a GE server.\n\n735\n00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:21,680\nSame thing.\n\n736\n00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,170\nActually, it's a little bit\ndifferent in there, isn't it?\n\n737\n00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,890\nJust the name, you know, level 3.\n\n738\n00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,610\nSo, basically it reached out and\nit couldn't resolve.\n\n739\n00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,190\nSo, now I've gotten a 2nd and\n3rd opinion on this and I know, alright,\n\n740\n00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,360\nit looks like all these DNS servers\ncan't be wrong, it's probably my fault.\n\n741\n00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,710\n>> Now there is a, right,\nso resolving names,\n\n742\n00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:49,560\nthere is a kind of a little steps that\nWindows takes to resolve names, right?\n\n743\n00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,970\nThe first thing it does\nis it checks itself.\n\n744\n00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:57,200\nIn my, so if I ping something,\nam I trying to look for.\n\n745\n00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,200\n>> Yeah, cuz if you're trying\nto ping your own system,\n\n746\n00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,720\nit doesn't need to do a DNS lookup.\n\n747\n00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,410\nIt knows that it is that IP.\n\n748\n00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,172\nSo yep, am I myself?\n\n749\n00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:06,671\nWhatever's the best way to say that.\n\n750\n00:38:06,671 --> 00:38:07,296\n>> Yep.\n\n751\n00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:11,670\nAnd so then it checks its DNS result or\nits cache.\n\n752\n00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,421\nSo its cache of its previous name\nlookups are already on there.\n\n753\n00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:17,490\nCuz that would be the easy place to check.\n\n754\n00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,250\nHave I already resolved this name?\n\n755\n00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,084\nIt checks that first.\n\n756\n00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:23,400\nOr second.\n\n757\n00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,580\nAnd it moves on.\n\n758\n00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,490\nAnd so it checks this thing\ncalled a host's file, right?\n\n759\n00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,910\n>> Let me, just really quick,\nI'm going to interject.\n\n760\n00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,255\nYou mentioned the DNS cache.\n\n761\n00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:39,517\nMost people never see this, in Windows\nit is caching your DNS lookup so\n\n762\n00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,213\nthat it can quickly use them if\nyou go back to that site again.\n\n763\n00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:48,111\nFrom the command prompt you can\nrun ipconfig/displayDNS and\n\n764\n00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:50,610\nit will show you that DNS cash.\n\n765\n00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,900\nThat's what I'm about to do here.\n\n766\n00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,020\nAnd so\nI can see records that I've looked up.\n\n767\n00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,000\nYou can see itpro.tv, itpro.tv zero,\nright, those are those lookups I just did.\n\n768\n00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,745\nYou see the other websites\nI've been to today.\n\n769\n00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:02,520\nGOG.com.\n\n770\n00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,370\nVery, very important business\nbeing conducted there.\n\n771\n00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,680\nSo, anyway,\nyou can see what's in that cache and\n\n772\n00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,850\nyou can flush the cache if you\nthink you just cached a bad value.\n\n773\n00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,360\nYou can say IP config/flushdns and\nflush it out.\n\n774\n00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,230\nThat's that DNS resolver cache.\n\n775\n00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,350\nNormally, we just ignore it.\n\n776\n00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:23,063\nIt's part of the lookup process,\nas Nate was saying but\n\n777\n00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:25,600\nyou can interact with it, with this.\n\n778\n00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,521\n>> If it is not in the cache,\nit checks this hosts file,\n\n779\n00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:33,980\nthis file that has static entries\non names to IP addresses,\n\n780\n00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,972\nchecks this file, and then,\nif not there then it shoots an query to\n\n781\n00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:43,820\nthe DNS servers to say I I don't\nhave this anywhere in my system.\n\n782\n00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,340\nI need you to find it.\n\n783\n00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,010\nSo go look for it.\n\n784\n00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:47,790\n>> Yep.\n\n785\n00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,550\nAnd that host file is a pretty cool one.\n\n786\n00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,300\nIt's been around for a long time.\n\n787\n00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300\nIt's in a really weird place on the drive.\n\n788\n00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,780\nIf you've watched our Network+ show,\nyou've already seen this.\n\n789\n00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,754\nBut, it's in C:\\Windows\\system 32.\n\n790\n00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:04,914\nEven in a 64-bit system,\nit's in System32\\Drivers\\etc and\n\n791\n00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:08,970\nyou'll see that hosts file right there.\n\n792\n00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:13,720\nThat host file allows us to\noverride the DNS servers.\n\n793\n00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,460\nOkay?\n\n794\n00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,810\nSo what, why would we use that?\n\n795\n00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,150\nWell there's a few reasons\nwhy we might want to do that,\n\n796\n00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,420\nwhere we might want to override DNS.\n\n797\n00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,920\nLet me give you a great example.\n\n798\n00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,720\nYou guys are watching the show\nright now on ITPro.tv.\n\n799\n00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,860\nAll right?\n\n800\n00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,110\nWell that's a production server, you guys\ngo to it, it's important for your access.\n\n801\n00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,330\nWhat if I want to experiment\nwith a new feature?\n\n802\n00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,250\nI don't want to do it on\nthe website you guys go to.\n\n803\n00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,440\nI don't want to break that.\n\n804\n00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,620\nSo, I have a research or\na development site.\n\n805\n00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,990\nA second version of ITPro.tv that's out\nthere and it doesn't have a domain name.\n\n806\n00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,680\nIt just has an IP address.\n\n807\n00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,180\nAnd what I do is I go\ninto my host file and\n\n808\n00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,130\nI put an entry in there that\nsays instead of going to\n\n809\n00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,960\nthe address we showed a minute ago for\nITProTV, go to this alternate address.\n\n810\n00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,780\nAll right?\nAnd so\n\n811\n00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,860\nlet me show you an example\nof that real quick.\n\n812\n00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,810\nJust so we can see how we can use that.\n\n813\n00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:12,136\nSo itpro.tv right now, the address you\nguys are getting is this 173.255.227.128.\n\n814\n00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:12,903\nRight?\n\n815\n00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:16,970\nBut, I could redirect that\nsomewhere else if I wanted to.\n\n816\n00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,145\nSo maybe I want to redirect it to,\nlet's redirect it to Google.\n\n817\n00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,013\n[COUGH] So\nI'll just pick one of their IPs.\n\n818\n00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,245\nOh, you know what, I'm not,\n\n819\n00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:36,665\nI don't have administrative\nprivileges in my command prompt.\n\n820\n00:41:36,665 --> 00:41:41,655\nIf you want to edit the host file, it does\nrequire administrative privileges, so\n\n821\n00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:47,209\nI'm having to relaunch my command prompt\nso that I'll have those privileges.\n\n822\n00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,140\nAnd I'm just gonna use Notepad,\nedit that host file and down in here,\n\n823\n00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,210\nI'm gonna say itpro.tv now\npoints to 74.125.140.106.\n\n824\n00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:05,410\nThat's one of Google's servers,\nand so I'll save that.\n\n825\n00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,900\nAnd now when I do an NS lookup for\nitpro.tv.\n\n826\n00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,120\nInstead of getting our address,\nI'll get the override.\n\n827\n00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,690\nActually it didn't.\n\n828\n00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,955\nLet me flush my cache.\n\n829\n00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:20,260\nThere we go.\n\n830\n00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,040\nAnd then let me try that again.\n\n831\n00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,600\nOr, you know what,\nnslookup goes straight to the DNS servers.\n\n832\n00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,919\nLet me try using ping instead.\n\n833\n00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:29,870\nThere we go.\n\n834\n00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,190\nSo now instead of getting\nthe ITproTV address,\n\n835\n00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:36,270\nI'm getting Google's address of 74.125 and\nso that's pulling it there.\n\n836\n00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,020\nThe nslookup command,\nit does go straight to the DNS server.\n\n837\n00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,833\nSo it's not necessarily\nthe best test of that but\n\n838\n00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:47,369\nlet me fire up a web browser and\ngo to ITProTV.\n\n839\n00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:49,067\nWe'll see what kind of\nfun we can have here.\n\n840\n00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:54,550\nAnd, I got to ITProTV and\nnow I get Google.\n\n841\n00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,750\nSo that's an example of how we use it.\n\n842\n00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,630\nI use it for\nour development environment all the time.\n\n843\n00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,580\nAnd when I test out new\nthings on the site,\n\n844\n00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,860\nI don't do it on the production side,\nI do it in the development.\n\n845\n00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,037\nAnd I use a host file\nto redirect me to it.\n\n846\n00:43:05,037 --> 00:43:06,416\n>> Sweet.\n\n847\n00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:10,590\nNow, as far as configuring\na name resolution.\n\n848\n00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:15,290\nRight?\nOn our client server that's about as far\n\n849\n00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,130\nas we'd take it.\n\n850\n00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,670\nRight?\nSo the order in which it resolves things,\n\n851\n00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,390\nand anything pass that,\nwe can troubleshoot,\n\n852\n00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,290\nfind out where the problem is occurring.\n\n853\n00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,520\nBut, the, yeah, resolving that would\nbe a little outside the scope of what\n\n854\n00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,940\n>> Do we need to mention the old stuff,\n\n855\n00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,390\nelem hosts and WINS.\n\n856\n00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,430\nDoes that still show up on the exam?\n\n857\n00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:36,820\n>> Sure.\n\n858\n00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,856\n>> We just mentioned it briefly.\n\n859\n00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:41,350\nRight?\nIn the old days, right, Windows 95,\n\n860\n00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:47,540\nWindows 98, NT4 you used a service called\nNet Bios to do your name resolution.\n\n861\n00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,470\nAnd even the latest version Windows 8\nstill supports Net Bios in the background.\n\n862\n00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,770\nJust most people don't use it.\n\n863\n00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,190\nSo it gets ignored.\n\n864\n00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,350\nBut when you pull up\nyour network settings,\n\n865\n00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,510\nin addition to setting up DNS servers,\nyou can go on to the advanced screen and\n\n866\n00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,190\nyou can set up what\nare called WINS servers.\n\n867\n00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,630\nAnd you really only need WINS if you\nstill got, I'm talking ancient stuff.\n\n868\n00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,590\nRight?\n\n869\n00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,400\nNT4 was released in 1996, 97.\n\n870\n00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,670\nSo we're talking about 15,\n17 year old software, that if\n\n871\n00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,975\nyou're still supporting systems that old,\nfirst off you need to go somewhere else.\n\n872\n00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:21,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Secondly, you may still need WINS.\n\n873\n00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,646\nAnd so as part of that name lookup\nprocess, it actually pages through those.\n\n874\n00:44:25,646 --> 00:44:32,690\nWe use the host file to override DNS, we\nused the LM hosts file to over ride WINS.\n\n875\n00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,570\nAnd you might have noticed\nwhen I was in that directory,\n\n876\n00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,900\nlet me pull it back up, that there\nwas a hosts file in my directory,\n\n877\n00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,200\nand an LM hosts.SAM,\nthat's That's short for sample.\n\n878\n00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,340\nBasically you create you\nown LM host file and\n\n879\n00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,960\nyou leave that .sam off and\nthat'll be the override for it.\n\n880\n00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,140\nSo, just wanted to point those\nout cause they are still there,\n\n881\n00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:58,620\nthat support is still there but most\npeople don't use it, don't encounter it.\n\n882\n00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,540\n>> Sweet, all right, yeah there you go.\n\n883\n00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,200\nNow I see a preparing Name Resolution.\n\n884\n00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,770\nPast that.\nRight?\n\n885\n00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:10,063\nSo now we have configuring\nnetwork locations.\n\n886\n00:45:10,063 --> 00:45:11,271\nNetwork locations, Right?\n\n887\n00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:14,700\nSo Windows 8 has three of them.\n\n888\n00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:20,205\nYou have a private, a work/domain\nlocation In a public location,\n\n889\n00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:23,693\nand whenever you connect to a new network.\n\n890\n00:45:23,693 --> 00:45:24,197\nRight?\n\n891\n00:45:24,197 --> 00:45:29,220\nAn unfamiliar network for\nyour machine, it'll ask.\n\n892\n00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,580\nWell, I guess first thing it'll ask\nis if it wants to turn on file and\n\n893\n00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,150\nprinter sharing, that kind of thing.\n\n894\n00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,740\nBut then it'll ask where\nare you connecting to?\n\n895\n00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,610\nIt has this little dialogue box.\n\n896\n00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:45,940\nAnd are you connecting to the home, to a\nwork/domain, or is this a public location?\n\n897\n00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:53,635\nAnd you know, it does play a role in\nhow functionality works pass that.\n\n898\n00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:56,735\n>> Yeah, basically what you're picking\nis what level of security you want on\n\n899\n00:45:56,735 --> 00:45:57,595\nthe interface.\n\n900\n00:45:57,595 --> 00:46:02,035\nSo, if you pick Public, your firewall's\ngonna be at its most restrictive setting,\n\n901\n00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:04,300\nyour shared folder's not gonna\nbe visible on the network.\n\n902\n00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,410\nThat's the networking you choose if you\nwere at the library, or at Starbucks or\n\n903\n00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,380\nat a hotel and you were on their wireless.\n\n904\n00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,500\nYou don't trust that network,\nyou want public.\n\n905\n00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,510\nWhen you choose Home,\nthat's when it's the most open.\n\n906\n00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,750\nRight?\nThen all your shared folders are visible.\n\n907\n00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,120\nYou can see other people on the network.\n\n908\n00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,970\nYou're allowing connections back in.\n\n909\n00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,450\nWhen you choose Work,\nit's kind of in-between.\n\n910\n00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,970\nRight?\nCertain things are locked down, but\n\n911\n00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:28,900\nmost things are open to allow you to\ncommunicate to an active directory domain.\n\n912\n00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,660\nAfter that dialogue box,\nyou pick your option and then your on.\n\n913\n00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,130\nYou don't normally have to\ninteract with it again.\n\n914\n00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:35,770\nRight?\n\n915\n00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,560\nAlthough sometimes we need to change it.\n\n916\n00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,000\nDo we need to dive into that, yeah?\n\n917\n00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,932\nDo you wanna do a demonstration\non changing it?\n\n918\n00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,688\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n919\n00:46:43,688 --> 00:46:45,640\nAll right, sweet.\n\n920\n00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,910\nSo now, yep, changing the stuff.\n\n921\n00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,440\nLet me pull up the-\n>> [LAUGH] No, no, it's, yeah.\n\n922\n00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,280\n>> Okay, all right, yeah, yeah.\n\n923\n00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,860\nAll right, pull up our settings.\n\n924\n00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,500\nRight?\nSo right now, right, so\n\n925\n00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,284\nthere's this network\nthat I'm connected to.\n\n926\n00:46:57,284 --> 00:46:58,802\nRight?\nI chose a Private network.\n\n927\n00:46:58,802 --> 00:47:02,570\nAll right, so, private network,\nand choosing your location yeah,\n\n928\n00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,836\nit just sets the firewall rules.\n\n929\n00:47:04,836 --> 00:47:10,670\nEssentially on Windows firewall,\nwhich is what rules are set in there for\n\n930\n00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,080\nwhat's allowed to share, what comes out,\nwhat comes in, that kind of thing.\n\n931\n00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,585\nSince the network I'm connected to here.\n\n932\n00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:18,900\nRight?\nI trust it, so it's a private network.\n\n933\n00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,040\nEverything is open that needs to be.\n\n934\n00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,078\nNow let's say, for one reason or another,\nI don't want to change this anymore.\n\n935\n00:47:26,078 --> 00:47:26,878\nAll right.\n\n936\n00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,372\nNow there is a setting to change that.\n\n937\n00:47:29,372 --> 00:47:30,240\nAll right.\n\n938\n00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,567\nAnd we do that through\nthe Local Group Policy.\n\n939\n00:47:39,777 --> 00:47:45,797\nUnder Computer Configuration\n> Windows Settings.\n\n940\n00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:52,500\nSecurity settings, and\nnetwork list manager policies.\n\n941\n00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,060\nListed in here will be all the networks\nthat you are currently connected to.\n\n942\n00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:03,580\nRight and there's a few others that all\nnetworks identify, unidentified networks.\n\n943\n00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,270\nHere up top is the one I\nam currently connected to.\n\n944\n00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,952\nDouble click on this\nbring up it's properties.\n\n945\n00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:12,430\nAll right so right now here\nwe go we can change the name.\n\n946\n00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,245\nLet's just change this to chickabow.\n\n947\n00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:18,610\n[LAUGH] All right so we can change that.\n\n948\n00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,310\nWe come back here.\n\n949\n00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,200\nOh, look now we are connected\nto the chickabow network, right.\n\n950\n00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,030\nKind of cool.\nIf you have a machine\n\n951\n00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,090\nwith a lot of different\nnetwork adapters at home.\n\n952\n00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:33,110\nI have a tower PC at the house and it's\ngot different network adapters into it,\n\n953\n00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,150\nyou know one I use for virtual\nmachines and they all go to, you know,\n\n954\n00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,970\ndifferent things for different stuff.\n\n955\n00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,430\nSo I don't get those confused,\nyeah, I've gone and\n\n956\n00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,773\nI've changed the names to all of them,\nso you know, easy to identify.\n\n957\n00:48:44,773 --> 00:48:50,030\nAll right, so there's that,\nwe can change user permissions whether or\n\n958\n00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,190\nnot users are allowed to change\nthere names and that kind of thing.\n\n959\n00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:57,160\nIcons and what not and\nwhether users can change it.\n\n960\n00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,110\nNetwork location, here we go.\n\n961\n00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,167\nNot configured, so\nwe just kinda leaves it the same and\n\n962\n00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:06,920\nwhether the users can change it or not.\n\n963\n00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,550\nSo let's change it to a, actually is\non the one I'm using right now, so\n\n964\n00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,960\nI don't wanna change it.\n\n965\n00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,750\nBut.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n966\n00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,750\n>> But we can click Public, right?\n\n967\n00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,300\nChoose Apply, OK, what not, and\n\n968\n00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,470\nit will change the network\nlocation from private to public.\n\n969\n00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:28,970\n>> Yeah, and you're not showing\nthe work home division on yours, but\n\n970\n00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,180\nthat's because you're not\njoined to a domain right.\n\n971\n00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,380\nSo, that's why it looks\na little bit different.\n\n972\n00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,810\nWhen a computer's joined to a domain\nan active directory domain,\n\n973\n00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,780\nthings do look a little bit different and\nyou'll see that in the server shell.\n\n974\n00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,598\nBut for right now, easy enough to change,\nand it's very quick, it's not one of those\n\n975\n00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:48,290\nthat you have to reboot or refresh for,\nthe change takes affect right away.\n\n976\n00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,620\nYou saw how fast the rename\noperation took place.\n\n977\n00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,240\nSo, pretty cool, pretty easy to do.\n\n978\n00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,380\n>> Yeah, you know and basically,\nI guess to just to wrap it all up,\n\n979\n00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:06,640\nnetwork locations, home, work domain,\npublic, and at the basic level it's\n\n980\n00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,960\njust changing the firewall rules on what\nis allowed out and what is allowed in.\n\n981\n00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,460\n>> Excellent.\n\n982\n00:50:13,462 --> 00:50:16,410\nAll right well Nate I think\nthat's a pretty good spot for\n\n983\n00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:17,080\nus to stop for a break.\n\n984\n00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,320\nYou got anything else to throw out?\n\n985\n00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,940\n>> Let me look at my notes.\n\n986\n00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,380\n>> Got to check the notes.\n\n987\n00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,380\n>> Yeah,\n>> We still have like\n\n988\n00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:28,140\n>> Well, we'll save the wireless and\n\n989\n00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,180\nall that, for the next segment.\n\n990\n00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,720\n>> So, yeah, there is one thing.\n\n991\n00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,660\nSo, home groups, right.\n\n992\n00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:41,290\nHome groups, this really needs windows\n8 thing or windows 7 item or two.\n\n993\n00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:45,580\nFor your network location,\nit has to be set on the home location.\n\n994\n00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,530\n>> Where it won't work.\n\n995\n00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,600\n>> It, yup, it just won't work.\n\n996\n00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,960\nSo yeah, that was a little quirky\nthing I ran into one time.\n\n997\n00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,800\nSo yeah, you have to go on the home\nlocation for Home group to work.\n\n998\n00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,380\n>> Yup.\n\n999\n00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,540\nYeah, I know, I bumped into that before\nwhere I had one set as public by accident\n\n1000\n00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,550\nand it just wouldn't work.\n\n1001\n00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,880\nAnd that's one of those scenarios\nwhere we might have to come in and\n\n1002\n00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,130\nchange our network type, right?\n\n1003\n00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:04,980\nAnd they don't make it easy.\n\n1004\n00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,700\nIt's not like you can change it\nright there in network options.\n\n1005\n00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,010\nYou gotta go into the local\nsecurity policy and all.\n\n1006\n00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,350\nSo for\na home user that's made that mistake,\n\n1007\n00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:13,800\nit's not the easiest thing to fix.\n\n1008\n00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,090\n>> Yeah, that's all I got.\n\n1009\n00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,500\nNetwork location.\n\n1010\n00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,660\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, let's take a break here.\n\n1011\n00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,280\nWhen we get back we're gonna jump\ninto some wireless networks and\n\n1012\n00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,030\na couple of the neat little\nthings that are in there.\n\n1013\n00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,934\nSo stay tuned,\nmore networking adventures after this.\n\n1014\n00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:34,295\n[MUSIC]\n\n1015\n00:51:34,295 --> 00:51:36,050\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1016\n00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:41,980\nSo we left off talking about networking\nactivity and we were doing our.\n\n1017\n00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,220\n>> Name resolution.\n\n1018\n00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,450\n>> Configuration, things like that,\nIP addresses and all that good stuff.\n\n1019\n00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,810\nWe talked a little about connectivity\nissues and we saw NS lookup and ping and\n\n1020\n00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,260\nsome of the ways to troubleshoot.\n\n1021\n00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,890\nWe left off one tool Nate\nreminded me during the break,\n\n1022\n00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,090\nthat we definitely wanna touch on.\n\n1023\n00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,010\nYou wanna tackle this one Nate?\n\n1024\n00:51:59,010 --> 00:51:59,954\n>> Yup.\nAll right, so\n\n1025\n00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:04,122\nwindows has this really neat tool,\nright A network monitor, all right.\n\n1026\n00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:07,788\nIt's not included in Windows,\nit is a free download and\n\n1027\n00:52:07,788 --> 00:52:09,900\nit is a packet capture, right?\n\n1028\n00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,770\n>> A free download from Microsoft, so it's\nan official tool and that's why we need to\n\n1029\n00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,250\ntalk about it, it can show up on the exam,\njust throwing that out there.\n\n1030\n00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,220\n>> So would it be a sniffer or a capture?\n\n1031\n00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,620\n>> Technically it is a packet capture and\nprotocol analyzer.\n\n1032\n00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,280\nSo it's one of those that does both.\n\n1033\n00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,760\n>> All right, so network monitor,\n\n1034\n00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,780\na free tool used to, you know,\nlet's just fire it up.\n\n1035\n00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,890\n>> So you guys might of seen in\nsome of the other shows where I\n\n1036\n00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,910\nused a product called Wire Shark.\n\n1037\n00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,250\nAnd Wireshark is an open\nsource protocol analyser and\n\n1038\n00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:49,120\nit captures packets on your network and\nlets you see them.\n\n1039\n00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:54,060\nWell, Network Monitor is a closed source\nMicrosoft only product that does basically\n\n1040\n00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,120\nthe same thing.\n\n1041\n00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,640\nIt allows you to capture those packets and\nsee what's going on.\n\n1042\n00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,910\nSo Nate's got it fired up.\n\n1043\n00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:00,790\n>> Yep, fired up.\n\n1044\n00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,290\nAll right, this is, yep so\nwe just installed this.\n\n1045\n00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:09,890\nSo the first thing to do to\ncapture your traffic, right?\n\n1046\n00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:12,100\nRight there, recent captures, create.\n\n1047\n00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,710\nSo a new capture, right?\n\n1048\n00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:15,880\nLet me start over.\n\n1049\n00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,005\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n1050\n00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:19,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ron as administrator, so\n\n1051\n00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,479\nit needs admin rights.\n\n1052\n00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:26,300\nAll right.\nSo now we can start a new capture and\n\n1053\n00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:26,910\nwe'll just click start.\n\n1054\n00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,730\nSo we don't want to define any filters.\n\n1055\n00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:32,300\nAnd there's other things you can do\nto really narrow down what it is\n\n1056\n00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,700\nyou are looking for.\n\n1057\n00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,080\nWe are just going to run it on\nthe defaults and there it goes, right.\n\n1058\n00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:43,180\nSo these are all the packets that are\ngoing out and in from my network adapter.\n\n1059\n00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,309\n>> And you can see that counter down\nat the bottom of the screen, 25000,\n\n1060\n00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:48,140\n28000, 30000, right?\n\n1061\n00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,453\nAnd that's because he's using the network\nto show you guys his screen, so\n\n1062\n00:53:51,453 --> 00:53:53,780\nall the video traffic is\nbeing generated over that.\n\n1063\n00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,350\nYou'll just see See those counters\nstart to go up and up and up.\n\n1064\n00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:59,640\nIt's actually doubled since I started\ntalking, we're at 60,000 now.\n\n1065\n00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,480\nAnd you can see each of\nthe individual packets going across\n\n1066\n00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,235\nthe network right there.\n\n1067\n00:54:03,235 --> 00:54:04,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1068\n00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,840\nYep, and so yeah, and that's what it is.\n\n1069\n00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,900\nIt captures all your traffic.\n\n1070\n00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:13,490\nYou can view details about these\npackets and narrow down what it is.\n\n1071\n00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,210\nI don't know if we want to get like\na whole, you know, packet lesson in here,\n\n1072\n00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:20,130\nbut, you know, real world example.\n\n1073\n00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,950\nI use this on my network.\n\n1074\n00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:24,260\nI have a right?\n\n1075\n00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,080\nAt my house.\n\n1076\n00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,460\nThis mobile little, mobile.\n\n1077\n00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,215\n>> Cell phone?\n\n1078\n00:54:29,215 --> 00:54:30,820\n>> [CROSSTALK.]\n>> Yep.\n\n1079\n00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,480\nAnd it just was not working.\n\n1080\n00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,550\nIt would not connect and so, to find out\na little bit more on what's going on,\n\n1081\n00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:42,980\nI ran a capture utility, and\nit showed all the traffic.\n\n1082\n00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,830\nAnd going through and\nlooking at the details,\n\n1083\n00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,780\nI was able to find out what was going on.\n\n1084\n00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:53,470\nAnd it was sending out these name\nrequests to nothing out in the distance.\n\n1085\n00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:57,340\n>> Yeah, it's a great utility to use to\nverify that your traffic is encrypted,\n\n1086\n00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,450\nlike you think it is, or\nyou might think it's encrypted,\n\n1087\n00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:00,680\nbut how do you really know?\n\n1088\n00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,760\nHere you can look at the packets and see.\n\n1089\n00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,170\nYou can also see on the left\nside of the screen,\n\n1090\n00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,550\nit had where you could\npick by application.\n\n1091\n00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:11,260\nAnd so you can see which programs are\nconsuming the most bandwidth or whatever.\n\n1092\n00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,510\nSo it does give you a lot of visibility.\n\n1093\n00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,050\nNow, I will say one thing on the exam,\nnetwork monitor,\n\n1094\n00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,710\ngreat tool, absolutely use\nthat as an answer on the exam.\n\n1095\n00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,293\nBut in real life land, the network\nmonitor is actually crippled, and\n\n1096\n00:55:23,293 --> 00:55:26,040\nMicrosoft doesn't advertise\nthis point very much.\n\n1097\n00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:31,040\nBut it will show broadcasts,\nand it will show unicasts where\n\n1098\n00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,560\nyour machine is either the source or\nthe destination.\n\n1099\n00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,100\nBut it will not show anything else.\n\n1100\n00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,906\nIt will not show any traffic that is not\ndestined to, or coming from your system or\n\n1101\n00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:44,160\nbroadcast.\n\n1102\n00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,670\nSo, if you're the hacker type, or\n\n1103\n00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,080\nyou're wanting to monitor somebody\nelse's communications for\n\n1104\n00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,300\ntroubleshooting purposes, the Network\nMonitor's not suitable for that.\n\n1105\n00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,630\nAnd that's where products like\nWire Shark are not crippled.\n\n1106\n00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:56,170\nThey'll show anything that\ncomes across the network card.\n\n1107\n00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,410\nAs they can see a lot more.\n\n1108\n00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:01,930\nSo, in real life land I very rarely use\nthe Network Monitor that comes from\n\n1109\n00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:02,740\nMicrosoft.\n\n1110\n00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,220\nI usually use Wire Shark.\n\n1111\n00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,860\n>> Right on.\n\n1112\n00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,720\nAs a basic tool, yeah, works great.\n\n1113\n00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,260\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1114\n00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,140\nYeah, and if you're just troubleshooting\none machine it does everything you need,\n\n1115\n00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,320\nit is from Microsoft.\n\n1116\n00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,350\nIt used to be packaged with\nWindows back in Windows XP.\n\n1117\n00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:20,460\nYou'd go to Add/Remove programs and\nyou'd choose, what is it,\n\n1118\n00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,210\nturn on and off Windows features or\nwhatever it said.\n\n1119\n00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,530\nAnd it was just a feature that\nwas right there on the disc.\n\n1120\n00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:28,590\nAnd starting with\nWindows Vista they removed it.\n\n1121\n00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,450\n>> Right on, right on.\n\n1122\n00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,580\nYeah good deal.\n\n1123\n00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:35,483\nAll right, so resolving internet\nconnectivity issues, right, IP config,\n\n1124\n00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:40,855\nright, IP config is a good one, IP config\nwith the slash all shows all the details.\n\n1125\n00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:45,150\nAnd say your networking stuff,\nright, you need a valid IP address,\n\n1126\n00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:48,930\nsubnet mask, you need a default gateway,\nDNS servers,\n\n1127\n00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,071\nI guess you're getting\nname resolution problems.\n\n1128\n00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:54,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, command line tool, right?\n\n1129\n00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:58,340\nIP config to help troubleshoot things and\nnarrow down where the problem is and\n\n1130\n00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,950\nonce you find it out, then you can\nfix it by changing your properties.\n\n1131\n00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:02,920\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1132\n00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,680\nYeah, so not too terribly much going\non there, the basic trouble shooting.\n\n1133\n00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,090\nFor those of you that are interested\nin even more advanced troubleshooting,\n\n1134\n00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:14,890\nI always jump back to like our A+ show\nwhere we have extensive troubleshooting\n\n1135\n00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,992\nnetworking sections and the Network\nPlus Show, where we have that also.\n\n1136\n00:57:17,992 --> 00:57:21,500\nAll right, so\nlet's move onto the next part.\n\n1137\n00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,994\nThe networks that we've been working with\nso far have been physical networks, right?\n\n1138\n00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:31,370\nYou know, our ethernet,\nI'll say ethernet, connections that\n\n1139\n00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:36,650\na lot of us have that are just regular\nwired copper connections but more commonly\n\n1140\n00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:40,840\ntoday we have wireless connection,\nso, wireless is very, very prevalent.\n\n1141\n00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,127\nAnd so, we do need to talk about some\nof the differences with connecting to\n\n1142\n00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,990\na wireless network than a wired network.\n\n1143\n00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:47,960\n>> Yep that's right.\n\n1144\n00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:54,803\nNow with the, right, wireless networks,\nright, so, the first sub-objective,\n\n1145\n00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:59,500\nright, on the next little grouping here,\nconnect to a wireless network.\n\n1146\n00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,290\nFortunately in Windows 8 it's\npretty straight forward, right?\n\n1147\n00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:08,710\nThere's not a whole lot going on\nto connect a wireless network.\n\n1148\n00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:12,803\nNow, this laptop I have right\nhere does have a wireless card.\n\n1149\n00:58:12,803 --> 00:58:13,626\nAnd let's just connect to\na wireless network, right Don?\n\n1150\n00:58:13,626 --> 00:58:20,080\n>> Sure, so getting connected to a\nwireless network, really straightforward.\n\n1151\n00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,820\nRight?\n\n1152\n00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,180\nThere's a couple of ways you can do it.\n\n1153\n00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,490\nI usually use the charms bar.\n\n1154\n00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,640\nRight?\nThe swipe in from the right\n\n1155\n00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,220\nside of the screen.\n\n1156\n00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,410\nThere we go.\n\n1157\n00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,040\nOh wait,\nI guess it's covered up by our heads.\n\n1158\n00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:38,180\nBut, let's go full screen on\nthat one Jason, there we go.\n\n1159\n00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,089\nAnd so\nwhen you swipe in on that charms bar.\n\n1160\n00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:48,186\nThere we go, we can go into settings\nat the bottom which takes us right in,\n\n1161\n00:58:48,186 --> 00:58:53,560\nand there we've got our networking and\nwe can see all our wireless networks.\n\n1162\n00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,790\nRight?\nReally super easy.\n\n1163\n00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:00,720\n>> Yep, and let's just connect to,\nright, studio network.\n\n1164\n00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,390\nSo we just, yep.\n\n1165\n00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,210\nClick on that guy.\n\n1166\n00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,880\nNow I probably chose to\nforget that network, hold on.\n\n1167\n00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,182\n>> Well it might reset your connection\nif you connect right now [CROSSTALK].\n\n1168\n00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:14,410\nIt might.\n\n1169\n00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,810\nSo when you connect, though,\nyou can just click on one and\n\n1170\n00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,330\nyou'll see that there\nweren't a lot of options.\n\n1171\n00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,287\nRight?\nConnect automatically just says if you\n\n1172\n00:59:20,287 --> 00:59:23,910\nre-detect this wireless network in\nthe future, automatically jump on it.\n\n1173\n00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,380\nYou may or may not want that, right?\n\n1174\n00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,860\nIf you're in a environment where you\nonly want to be on the network for\n\n1175\n00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,420\na little while and you don't wanna\naccidentally connect cuz you don't trust\n\n1176\n00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,850\nthe network you might\nnot wanna choose that.\n\n1177\n00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:37,400\nYou might wanna manually connect and\nyou do that just by hitting connect.\n\n1178\n00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,880\n>> Yep.\nAll right.\n\n1179\n00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,590\nI chose to forget the network so\nthat we could enter in our key again.\n\n1180\n00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,820\nClicking on connect for\nthe wireless network, right, so\n\n1181\n00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:50,130\nit brings us to this new little screen\nhere where it asks for the network key.\n\n1182\n00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:54,920\nNow some wireless networks might be\nopen to where a password is not needed,\n\n1183\n00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,435\nthis one it is and I would say probably\nmost network, or wireless network,\n\n1184\n00:59:58,435 --> 01:00:03,520\nwireless networks out there would,\nyou need a password of some sort.\n\n1185\n01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,250\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1186\n01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,920\nEven the free wireless\nthat like most hotels,\n\n1187\n01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,030\na lot of times will require a password.\n\n1188\n01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,900\nSometimes they're open but then they\nhave that captured portal thing or\n\n1189\n01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,650\ncaptive portal, where you end up\nhaving to go to their webpage.\n\n1190\n01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,790\nSo different places use\ndifferent requirements,\n\n1191\n01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:19,340\nbut you'll normally see a password.\n\n1192\n01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,710\n>> All right.\n\n1193\n01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:21,990\nYeah, we just key in our password.\n\n1194\n01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,860\nWe click on Next and\nhere is that menu where we can choose\n\n1195\n01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,534\nwhether we want a private or a public.\n\n1196\n01:00:30,534 --> 01:00:31,480\nRight?\n\n1197\n01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:35,380\nSo, no, do not turn on private in\nsharing for networks and public places.\n\n1198\n01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:39,650\nSo this one says in the public location,\nand put those rules on.\n\n1199\n01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:44,310\nThe next option, yes, turn on sharing and\nconnect to other devices for\n\n1200\n01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:47,970\nyour home and work networks, and yeah,\n\n1201\n01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:52,340\nit just sets the sharing rules and\nyour firewall for files and\n\n1202\n01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,324\nI do trust this network, so we'll just\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1203\n01:00:55,324 --> 01:00:56,760\n>> Say yes and there it goes and\n\n1204\n01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,360\nit's gonna reach out and\npull those settings down,\n\n1205\n01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,440\nDHCP settings, and configure itself.\n\n1206\n01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:02,940\nAnd that's.\n\n1207\n01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:05,260\n>> That's basically it.\n\n1208\n01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:05,980\nYeah.\n\n1209\n01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:10,460\nNow, you can only be connected to\none wireless network at a time.\n\n1210\n01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,240\nThat's, it's kind of a common\nsense limitation that you've got.\n\n1211\n01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,350\nBut if you try and\nconnect to a different network,\n\n1212\n01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:20,680\nit will disconnect you from the first\none and connect you to the new one.\n\n1213\n01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,730\nThat means that if you do have more than\none wireless network like we do here,\n\n1214\n01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,670\nyou might need to set priorities\nto pick which ones are more\n\n1215\n01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:29,440\nimportant than the other ones, right?\n\n1216\n01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,145\n>> Yep.\n\n1217\n01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:35,540\nNow, in previous editions of Windows,\nthere was this preferred\n\n1218\n01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:41,280\nnetwork kind of thing, where you can set a\npriority on if two networks are in range,\n\n1219\n01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,878\nthey would choose one over the other.\n\n1220\n01:01:42,878 --> 01:01:46,800\nNow Windows 8 It doesn't\nreally have that anymore.\n\n1221\n01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,140\nIt does have, so it doesn't have preferred\nnetworks, it has a connection priority.\n\n1222\n01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,760\nAnd it's pretty sweet the way it works.\n\n1223\n01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,340\nSo Windows 8 will remember the networks\nthat you connect to most and\n\n1224\n01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,400\nit will choose that network.\n\n1225\n01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,350\nNow, so\nif there are two networks within range and\n\n1226\n01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:06,090\nyou choose one over the other, when both\nof those networks are in range again,\n\n1227\n01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,980\nit will choose choose\nthat preferred network.\n\n1228\n01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:15,598\nSo you can kind of force it a little bit,\nyeah,\n\n1229\n01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:20,128\nlet's jump back over here\nto my computer here and\n\n1230\n01:02:20,128 --> 01:02:25,118\nwhen joining one, right,\nconnect automatically.\n\n1231\n01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:25,760\nRight?\n\n1232\n01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,864\nSo that's one way to, I guess\nthe orange doesn't pop up too well,\n\n1233\n01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:32,650\nthat's one way to yeah, kind of restrict.\n\n1234\n01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,440\nSo do not connect automatically.\n\n1235\n01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,380\nThat will be one way to force it.\n\n1236\n01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,650\nNow, there are mobile broadband cards,\nall right?\n\n1237\n01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:44,010\nMobile broadband cards would fall\ninto what's called a metered network.\n\n1238\n01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,730\nNow, metered networks are never\npreferred over Wi-Fi.\n\n1239\n01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,170\nNow, in Windows 8,\n\n1240\n01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:55,460\nwhen it does try to connect to something,\nit chooses wired connections first.\n\n1241\n01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,426\nRight, so your ethernet.\n\n1242\n01:02:56,426 --> 01:03:02,600\nThen it chooses Wi-Fi networks, and\nthen last it chooses metered connections.\n\n1243\n01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,240\nNow, there is something else that\nwe could do on Wi-Fi networks.\n\n1244\n01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:11,000\nAnother way to kind of\nforce a preferred list\n\n1245\n01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,990\nis you can change a network adapter and\ntell it that this is a metered network.\n\n1246\n01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:19,950\nSo if you are within range it\nwon't connect automatically\n\n1247\n01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:24,448\nversus whereas un-checking this box here,\nwill yeah, not let it connect.\n\n1248\n01:03:24,448 --> 01:03:26,810\nBut yeah, pretty sweet.\n\n1249\n01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,471\nIt does, it kinda learns your habits and\n\n1250\n01:03:29,471 --> 01:03:32,460\nit does pick those\nnetworks over the others.\n\n1251\n01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:38,010\n>> Now, Nate mentioned how Windows\nwill Prefer a wired card first.\n\n1252\n01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,490\nAnd then wireless, and\nthen metered, right?\n\n1253\n01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:43,200\nSo that's our,\nour adapter preference order.\n\n1254\n01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,200\nThat is, it's set in the system,\nit's hidden from us as an option, but\n\n1255\n01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,980\nit actually can be overridden.\n\n1256\n01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,340\nLet me show you guys how,\nhow we would override that, and\n\n1257\n01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,772\nI can just pull it up here on mine.\n\n1258\n01:03:52,772 --> 01:03:53,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1259\n01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:57,058\n>> So we don't mess yours up,\nlet me get down to my desktop here.\n\n1260\n01:03:57,058 --> 01:04:01,720\nSo I'm gonna go into my network and\nsharing center like we were earlier.\n\n1261\n01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,960\nAnd when we go to this screen you can\ngo to change adapter settings, and\n\n1262\n01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,190\nthat's the screen where you'll see\nall your network adapters, right?\n\n1263\n01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:08,290\nSo I've got my.\n\n1264\n01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:12,570\nMy wireless card, my wire card,\nwhatever, you start to see them in here.\n\n1265\n01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,700\nThere's a hidden menu in this screen.\n\n1266\n01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:20,330\nIf you hit Alt+V or Alt+F or\nAlt+T, any of the keyboard\n\n1267\n01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:25,449\nshortcuts to pull down a menu list,\nit will drop down the menu.\n\n1268\n01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:29,489\nAnd you can go to the advanced menu,\nright, so this is just hidden by default,\n\n1269\n01:04:29,489 --> 01:04:32,859\nI usually just hit Alt+F or Alt+V,\nthat brings the menu down and\n\n1270\n01:04:32,859 --> 01:04:34,650\nthen I can go to advanced.\n\n1271\n01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:37,729\nAnd here under advanced, you'll see\nwhere we've got the advanced settings.\n\n1272\n01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:43,680\nAnd that's where we can start to set what\norder our adaptors are preferred in.\n\n1273\n01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,200\nOkay, now I've got two\nphysical adaptors here, so\n\n1274\n01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,950\nI've got local area connection to and\ninternal network,\n\n1275\n01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:54,290\nthat's actually my wireless card right\nthere, as I'm pointing in the wrong spot.\n\n1276\n01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,220\nSo, you know, we've got those,\nI've got remote access connections,\n\n1277\n01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:00,950\nthat would be like dial up,\nPPPOE connections if we had those.\n\n1278\n01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,020\nAnd the order they're listed\nhere is the preference.\n\n1279\n01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,460\nSo if I want my wireless card to\nbe preferred over my wired card,\n\n1280\n01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,770\nI could select it, and\nthen I could hit that up arrow, and\n\n1281\n01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:15,190\nthen it's going to become the preferred\ncard over my wire, right.\n\n1282\n01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:17,790\nSo we can manipulate that right here.\n\n1283\n01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:21,062\nThe thing to remember is it's\njust a hidden menu option.\n\n1284\n01:05:21,062 --> 01:05:25,984\nIt also allows us to change whether\nIPV6 or IPV4 is the preferred protocol,\n\n1285\n01:05:25,984 --> 01:05:27,550\nso you can bump that up.\n\n1286\n01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:32,320\nBecause Windows 7, Windows 8,\nWindows Vista, they all prefer IPV6 First,\n\n1287\n01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,600\nthey always try that.\n\n1288\n01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,300\nBut if you know you're\nnot using IPv6 anywhere,\n\n1289\n01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,925\nthat's a little bit of wasted time.\n\n1290\n01:05:37,925 --> 01:05:40,290\nWe're talking nanoseconds,\nbut some people like that, so\n\n1291\n01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:43,020\nyou can bump up IPv4 to be\nthe preferred protocol.\n\n1292\n01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:46,380\nSo kinda neat stuff just hidden\naway here in the back end.\n\n1293\n01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,560\n>> Hm, that's awesome.\n\n1294\n01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,810\nYou know,\nI didn't know that little menu existed.\n\n1295\n01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:51,700\n>> Oh, you've never seen that one?\n\n1296\n01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,767\n>> No.\n>> Oh, yeah, that one,\n\n1297\n01:05:52,767 --> 01:05:55,110\nthat one's actually\nbeen there a long time.\n\n1298\n01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,490\nIt used to be a big deal.\n\n1299\n01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:59,530\nAnd the reason I know about\nit is back in the NT4 days,\n\n1300\n01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,810\nright, TCP/IP was not\nthe default protocol back then.\n\n1301\n01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:03,940\nNet Buoy was.\n\n1302\n01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,660\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And so if you were on an IP network,\n\n1303\n01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,510\nyou wanted to change that priority\nto make your system faster.\n\n1304\n01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,040\nAnd it was a noticeable difference.\n\n1305\n01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:17,062\nNow it's really just a matter of personal\npreference, not, not so much performance.\n\n1306\n01:06:17,062 --> 01:06:17,744\n>> Mm-hm. [LAUGH].\nThanks, that's sweet [INAUDIBLE.\n\n1307\n01:06:17,744 --> 01:06:18,393\nAll right.\nSo yeah,\n\n1308\n01:06:18,393 --> 01:06:20,580\nthere's yup preferred networks, right?\n\n1309\n01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:21,183\n>> There we go.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1310\n01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:22,100\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1311\n01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:27,170\n>> Now the the next little bit that we\nhave are network adapter properties.\n\n1312\n01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:33,570\nSo some of the properties we did look at\nbefore and Don, you have your computer up,\n\n1313\n01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:36,140\nlet's take a gander at\nyour network properties.\n\n1314\n01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,570\n>> I would say we've been through\nmost of the properties at this point.\n\n1315\n01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,920\nLet's dive back in there.\n\n1316\n01:06:41,048 --> 01:06:45,660\n>> Yep, so with a network adapter\nhighlighted on your network\n\n1317\n01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,745\nconnections screen just real quick\n>> Cancel on that one.\n\n1318\n01:06:48,745 --> 01:06:49,890\n>> Yep.\n\n1319\n01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:53,370\nSo when you have a certain\nadapter highlighted.\n\n1320\n01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:56,010\nSo there are some things\nacross the bar there.\n\n1321\n01:06:56,010 --> 01:07:01,550\nWe rename things, disable devices,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1322\n01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,900\nWe have quick stuff to\nquickly manage that guy.\n\n1323\n01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,390\nNow let all right.\n\n1324\n01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:10,750\n>> I've got to use this,\nthis stuff that I am learning now.\n\n1325\n01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:13,420\n>> Do you want to use local\ngroup policy and change it?\n\n1326\n01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,440\n>> No.\n\n1327\n01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,450\n>> All right, all right, yep.\n\n1328\n01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:17,470\nAll right,\nlet's pull up one of your adapters there.\n\n1329\n01:07:20,152 --> 01:07:22,860\nAll right and\nproperties down there on the bottom.\n\n1330\n01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:27,030\n>> You know, my adapter is showing as\n10 gigabit, that's pretty impressive.\n\n1331\n01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:27,970\n>> That is fast.\n\n1332\n01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,490\n>> I have no idea why it's\nshowing up that way, but it is.\n\n1333\n01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:33,660\nAll right, so\nhere's my wired network properties.\n\n1334\n01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:37,480\n>> Yep, all right,\nlet's click on the configure button.\n\n1335\n01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,050\nBut let's configure this adapter.\n\n1336\n01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,660\nRight, so there's a, right,\nso we got some things right.\n\n1337\n01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,960\nWe have a driver, and details,\nevents, all that fun stuff.\n\n1338\n01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,500\nAdvanced is where we are after.\n\n1339\n01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,000\nRight?\nOh, you got the a small list on that guy.\n\n1340\n01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,390\n>> You know, it varies by network adapter,\nsome network adapters will have a ton of\n\n1341\n01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:59,750\noptions, others will just\nhave a small set of options.\n\n1342\n01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:03,810\nI am actually inside of a virtual machine,\nso this is a virtualized network adapter,\n\n1343\n01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:06,480\nwhich is why I have so\nfew options in here.\n\n1344\n01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,560\nI'll have things like MTU, the maximum\ntransmission unit, I can adjust it's size\n\n1345\n01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,600\nI've got like whether it's\na locally administered address.\n\n1346\n01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,542\nAn address that we assign to it.\n\n1347\n01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:19,710\nThat's for\nlike overriding the MAC address.\n\n1348\n01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,210\nSo we've got some different\noptions there but, yeah,\n\n1349\n01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:22,460\nI don't get a lot of options in a VM.\n\n1350\n01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:22,966\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1351\n01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:25,180\n>> You just pulled yours\nup on a physical adapter.\n\n1352\n01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,315\nLet, let's let's switch\nover to Nate's machine.\n\n1353\n01:08:27,315 --> 01:08:28,690\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n1354\n01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:31,000\nSo on on mine here, right?\n\n1355\n01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,700\nThere's, yeah, oh,\na slew of different options and, you know,\n\n1356\n01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:39,630\nthings that we can do to configure,\nyou know, there are, you know,\n\n1357\n01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:42,890\nwe won't go out, you know, and\ndive into every option that we have here.\n\n1358\n01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:48,940\nThere are a,\na few to pick out right wake on LAN.\n\n1359\n01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,860\nRight?\nWake on LAN settings.\n\n1360\n01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:54,478\nDone through the advance\nproperties of adapter.\n\n1361\n01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:55,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1362\n01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,340\n>> Yeah.\n\n1363\n01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:56,940\nGoodness.\n\n1364\n01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,710\nAdd various things.\n\n1365\n01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:00,696\n>> Some of the things that I\nend up coming in here for.\n\n1366\n01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:03,460\nYou've got things like speed and duplex.\n\n1367\n01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:06,080\nSo if you choose speed and duplex,\nyou'll have a drop down box.\n\n1368\n01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,530\nAnd here most systems are set\nto auto-negotiate, but\n\n1369\n01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:14,160\nif you're having a problem with that,\nyou can hard set your system at 100Mb or\n\n1370\n01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:18,710\na gigabit, or 10Mb, or whatever and\nforce it into half or full duplex.\n\n1371\n01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,830\nRemember the gigabit only\noperates in full duplex.\n\n1372\n01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:22,040\nYou don't have that choice.\n\n1373\n01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,270\nSo you can override it,\nthat's one thing that I come in here for.\n\n1374\n01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:27,210\nTCP offload engines.\n\n1375\n01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:32,270\nIf you've got a network adaptor that\nsupport TCP offloading where the hardware\n\n1376\n01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:35,710\ndoes all your check sums as opposed\nto software, you can come in here and\n\n1377\n01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:40,360\nturn it on if your card supports,\nright, looks like Nate's does.\n\n1378\n01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:44,010\nThe other thing is VLANs,\nVirtual Local Area Networks.\n\n1379\n01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:48,290\nSome network adapters do support VLANs,\nand looks like Nate's does.\n\n1380\n01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:50,220\nAnd so you can come in here and\nassign a VLAN number.\n\n1381\n01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:53,090\nIf any of you guys have\nbeen watching the CCENT,\n\n1382\n01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:57,530\nthe Cisco show, we've been diving into\nVLAN so you get a chance to see it there.\n\n1383\n01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:01,752\nSo theres, theres some of the big ones\nthat I, I have to come in here for,\n\n1384\n01:10:01,752 --> 01:10:05,240\nmost of the rest of the stuff in here\nis not something that you need to,\n\n1385\n01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:10,200\nto modify on a regular basis,\nor any time at all really.\n\n1386\n01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,150\n>> Yep, but, yeah, so\ndifferent network adapters which will\n\n1387\n01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:15,965\nhave different settings,\nthings that you can, control on it, right?\n\n1388\n01:10:15,965 --> 01:10:16,608\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1389\n01:10:16,608 --> 01:10:21,490\n>> And yep, in some situations, it might\nbe necessary to modify some of those,\n\n1390\n01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:24,680\nbut I'd say generally, the,\nthe defaults work just fine.\n\n1391\n01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,940\n>> And another thing is, if you don't see\nthe option in there that you're looking\n\n1392\n01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,665\nfor, sometimes you can go and do a driver\nupdate and then you'll get those options.\n\n1393\n01:10:31,665 --> 01:10:35,775\nI've had where I was using a network\nadaptor driver that I got from Dell, and\n\n1394\n01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,575\nit didn't have the option\nI was looking for.\n\n1395\n01:10:37,575 --> 01:10:40,875\nIt was an Intel card, so I went and\ngot the driver straight from Intel, and\n\n1396\n01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:41,775\nnow I had the option.\n\n1397\n01:10:41,775 --> 01:10:43,725\nSo, so those options are all set and\n\n1398\n01:10:43,725 --> 01:10:47,965\ndetermined by the driver that you're\nusing for that network adapter.\n\n1399\n01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:51,055\nIf you're using the built in Windows\ndriver, you might have very,\n\n1400\n01:10:51,055 --> 01:10:52,420\nvery few options.\n\n1401\n01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:55,640\nBut if you're using the actual vendor\ndrivers they'll usually have the full set.\n\n1402\n01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,889\n>> Mm-hm.\nNice, well good deal yeah,\n\n1403\n01:10:57,889 --> 01:11:02,713\nadapter properties, that's about all I\nhave on adapter properties, at least for,\n\n1404\n01:11:02,713 --> 01:11:06,880\nyou know, what we're concerned about for\nyou know this scope.\n\n1405\n01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,760\n>> The last thing we have for\nthis objective Nate,\n\n1406\n01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,712\nis location aware printing,\ndo you think we have enough time for that?\n\n1407\n01:11:11,712 --> 01:11:14,090\n>> No, you know, let yeah.\n\n1408\n01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:15,590\nLet's save that for the next segment.\n\n1409\n01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,350\n>> Okay.\nWell, let, let's stop here then.\n\n1410\n01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:19,260\nWe'll go ahead and\nstop a little early and take a break.\n\n1411\n01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,510\nWhen we get back,\nwe got Location Aware Printing,\n\n1412\n01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,740\nwhich takes a little more\ntime than what we have.\n\n1413\n01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,300\nSo we'll get that after the break, and\n\n1414\n01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,460\nthen we'll wrap up with, with our, our\nfinal thoughts on Windows 8 networking.\n\n1415\n01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,170\n>> All right.\n\n1416\n01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:31,830\nSee you then.\n\n1417\n01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:40,150\n[MUSIC].\n\n1418\n01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:43,295\nAll right ladies and\ngentlemen so we're up and\n\n1419\n01:11:43,295 --> 01:11:49,030\ndown now with one of our last topics for\ntoday which is location aware printing.\n\n1420\n01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,740\n>> Yep.\n\n1421\n01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:53,670\n>> Now, I have this problem myself so,\nit's a feature\n\n1422\n01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:57,630\nthat I appreciate having in windows\n>> When I'm here in the office,\n\n1423\n01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,930\nwe have a office printer in the back.\n\n1424\n01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:03,590\nOne of those big giant\nstaple hole punch type jobs.\n\n1425\n01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:07,400\nThat is what I like to print to\nwhen I'm here at the office.\n\n1426\n01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,460\nWhen I go home I have a little tiny\n\n1427\n01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:14,160\nprinter that's one of those\nscanner combo hunk of junk things.\n\n1428\n01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,570\nBut that's what I print\nto when I'm at home.\n\n1429\n01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:17,210\n>> Right?\n\n1430\n01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:21,700\nAnd in the past, if I was at the office,\nI just set this one as the default.\n\n1431\n01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,480\nAnd when I went home,\n\n1432\n01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,700\nI would have to manually pick that printer\nevery time I wanted to print to it.\n\n1433\n01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,795\nSo, kind of frustrating, not that big\nof a deal at the end of the day, right?\n\n1434\n01:12:30,795 --> 01:12:32,604\nIt kind of comes down to just being lazy.\n\n1435\n01:12:32,604 --> 01:12:34,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it wasn't that big of a deal.\n\n1436\n01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:39,405\nBut Microsoft appreciates\nmy desire to do less and so\n\n1437\n01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:44,810\n[LAUGH] they introduced a feature and\nit wasn't new to Windows 8 was it?\n\n1438\n01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:46,355\nDidn't they introduce it in Windows 7 or\nsomething?\n\n1439\n01:12:46,355 --> 01:12:47,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay, all right, so\n\n1440\n01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,640\nthey introduced it in Windows 7\n>> They said\n\n1441\n01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,680\nwhy not pick your default printer based\non what network you're connected to.\n\n1442\n01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,170\nAnd that's what location\naware printing is.\n\n1443\n01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:03,190\n>> You know Don, thinking about\nnetworks and stuff right and\n\n1444\n01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:08,650\nthe users I guess acceptance of\n>> The network.\n\n1445\n01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,230\nPrinters is one thing, right?\n\n1446\n01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:14,550\nSo everything could be fine but as soon\nas the printer they want to print to\n\n1447\n01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,350\nis either somewhere else\nthat's not showing up or\n\n1448\n01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,250\nit's down, it can really hose things up.\n\n1449\n01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:23,040\n>> Yeah, you get people being way\nmore vocal about the issue when it's\n\n1450\n01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,560\ntheir printer.\n\n1451\n01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,550\nIt's a bizarre thing.\n\n1452\n01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:28,000\nEven though most people should\nbe paperless at this point,\n\n1453\n01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,330\nyou do get people who are crazy about it.\n\n1454\n01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:34,940\nI always made the joke that, and\nit's only half a joke really,\n\n1455\n01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,870\nif you're working on a network and\nthings are broken, servers are down,\n\n1456\n01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:42,290\nrouters are on fire,\nthat as long as there's one\n\n1457\n01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:46,155\nprinter somewhere that you can still print\nyour resume on then you're okay, right?\n\n1458\n01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if all the printers are down and\n\n1459\n01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:50,090\nyou can't print your resume\nthen you've got a real problem.\n\n1460\n01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:52,880\nThat's when you start sweating.\n\n1461\n01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,400\n>> Yep.\n\n1462\n01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:58,320\nNow, with a location where we're printing,\none of the things to keep in mind,\n\n1463\n01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,980\nit only works with devices\nthat have a battery.\n\n1464\n01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:08,080\nSo if you lug your desktop all\nover the place it won't work.\n\n1465\n01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,670\nIt has to have, Windows has to\nknow that I have a battery and\n\n1466\n01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:18,380\nthat's when the feature or\nsetting or thing yeah, it's working.\n\n1467\n01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:21,290\nSo let's set it up.\n\n1468\n01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:21,790\n>> Okay, great.\n\n1469\n01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:27,930\n>> So first things first right,\nwe can jump over to our start screen.\n\n1470\n01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:33,680\nAnd we'll just go to devices,\nsettings, and right there.\n\n1471\n01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,160\nDevices and Printers.\n\n1472\n01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,340\nAnd our devices and printers,\nwhen it populates, right.\n\n1473\n01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,610\nThere are a number of printers.\n\n1474\n01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:42,900\nNumber of printers in here.\n\n1475\n01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:47,900\nAnd in select one and\nchoose set as the default printer.\n\n1476\n01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,720\nNow, I'm connected to this network,\nand so I'm not going to disconnect and\n\n1477\n01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,710\ngo to another one and mess things up.\n\n1478\n01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:57,010\nBut when I go to the house right,\nand my computer\n\n1479\n01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:59,150\n>> Connects to a different network.\n\n1480\n01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:02,420\nThen it will change the default printer.\n\n1481\n01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,650\nAnd when you are connected\nto the other network,\n\n1482\n01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:07,220\nyou can choose just like on this one.\n\n1483\n01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:10,089\nLike I have this Cannon is\nwhat I have at the house.\n\n1484\n01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:13,720\nAnd you can set that one\nas a default printer.\n\n1485\n01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,750\nAnd Windows 8 will remember it.\n\n1486\n01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:21,270\nSo next time you are on your work network\nand it connects to this laser one.\n\n1487\n01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:22,170\nI'm not sure where that.\n\n1488\n01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,270\nShould we print to it?\n\n1489\n01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:26,470\n>> Is that the one in Tim's office?\n\n1490\n01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,040\n>> See what happens?\n\n1491\n01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,970\nYeah.\n>> He'd get a kick out of that.\n\n1492\n01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:30,150\nSet it to his page.\n\n1493\n01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:34,470\nSo, yeah, and you know Windows 8,\nit's really neat, it will remember\n\n1494\n01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,980\nwhat the default printers that you chose\non the network that you connect to.\n\n1495\n01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,660\nNow we can take it a little\nbit further and manage,\n\n1496\n01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:47,350\nlike if we want to pre stage our\nprinter preferred printing deal.\n\n1497\n01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,290\nTo get there, right.\n\n1498\n01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:49,650\nYou can just select a printer, right?\n\n1499\n01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:53,800\nHave it highlighted, and\nthen manage default printers.\n\n1500\n01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,690\nPresent this neat little thing,\nnow, we can turn this off,\n\n1501\n01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:59,600\nbut I don't know why anybody would\nwant to turn this thing off, right?\n\n1502\n01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,380\nI mean, it's a really neat feature but\nthey still, with everything,\n\n1503\n01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,985\ngive you the option to\nnot have cool features.\n\n1504\n01:16:04,985 --> 01:16:06,930\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we're going to leave this on.\n\n1505\n01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:11,700\nAnd these are the networks, right,\nthat this computer has connected to.\n\n1506\n01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:16,680\nAll right, we've got so on No Network if\nI'm not connected to anything then it's\n\n1507\n01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,580\ngoing to default to the document writer.\n\n1508\n01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:23,100\nAnd so right here,\nwe can select it under select printer and\n\n1509\n01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,970\nchoose which one, right, for the update.\n\n1510\n01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:29,970\nRight now I'm connected to this one\non the tree renamed chickabell and\n\n1511\n01:16:29,970 --> 01:16:33,140\nlet's default this one and\nwe can change it to.\n\n1512\n01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,050\nThis other guy, update.\n\n1513\n01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,090\nNow it is the default printer.\n\n1514\n01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:42,750\nAnd then the chicka-bow-wow, right,\nthat's the one I have at the house, and\n\n1515\n01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,470\nit defaults to the cannon printer.\n\n1516\n01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,430\nAnd, you know, we remove entries.\n\n1517\n01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:52,234\nBut here is how we can manage\nour default printers based\n\n1518\n01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:56,003\non what network our computer connects to.\n\n1519\n01:16:56,003 --> 01:16:58,690\nYeah, it is a neat feature,\nit's really simple to work with.\n\n1520\n01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,370\nMost people don't realize\nthat it's automatic.\n\n1521\n01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:04,620\nThat if you just change your default\nprinter it's remembering that it's just\n\n1522\n01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,650\nfor that network.\n\n1523\n01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:09,020\nAnd this is all built around\nthe network ID's that are set for\n\n1524\n01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:12,250\neach network adapter, for\neach wireless network that you connect to.\n\n1525\n01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:16,890\nSo it's all kind of built right in\nwhich is really it's a neat thing.\n\n1526\n01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:21,070\nIt's neat having that functionality\njust right there in the system and\n\n1527\n01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:21,678\nwithout much work.\n\n1528\n01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:22,908\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1529\n01:17:22,908 --> 01:17:26,010\nYeah and there's a lot of other things.\n\n1530\n01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:27,740\nWindows 8 does it.\n\n1531\n01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:31,790\nA lot of defaults,\nneat little things that does.\n\n1532\n01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:36,370\nI was putting some things together for\nthe name resolution.\n\n1533\n01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:39,615\nAnd I was purposely trying to\nget things to not resolve.\n\n1534\n01:17:39,615 --> 01:17:40,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1535\n01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:44,360\njust Windows 8 running as a default\nsetting up its little network\n\n1536\n01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,860\nconfiguration between these\n>> To VMs.\n\n1537\n01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:49,385\nI had a challenge to get things to,\n\n1538\n01:17:49,385 --> 01:17:52,860\n[INAUDIBLE] turn things off,\npassword, fun stuff.\n\n1539\n01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:57,270\n>> Yeah and for those of you who\ngo on watch the server show,\n\n1540\n01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:58,840\nthat are working on getting their MCSC.\n\n1541\n01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:04,130\nIn the server side we'll learn all\nabout like group policies where we can\n\n1542\n01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:07,740\nforce default printers and even just\nregular printers onto people's machines.\n\n1543\n01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:10,240\n>> So there's a lot of control and\na lot of power at that higher level.\n\n1544\n01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,560\nBut even right here,\njust at the regular desktop level,\n\n1545\n01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,420\nthere's some pretty neat stuff.\n\n1546\n01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:15,390\n>> Yep.\n\n1547\n01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:19,865\nWell Don, that's all I have for\nprinter awareness, right?\n\n1548\n01:18:19,865 --> 01:18:22,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, do you have anything else?\n\n1549\n01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:24,450\n>> Yeah.\nSo what we've seen so far,\n\n1550\n01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:28,960\nthat's all just basic networking\nconfiguration options, so we've seen that.\n\n1551\n01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,810\nThe next thing that's in our\nobjective list is some of\n\n1552\n01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:33,240\nthe network security stuff, right?\n\n1553\n01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,170\nFirewalls.\n\n1554\n01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:38,200\nIPsec, and all that we want to make sure\nwe do those topics just as we definitely\n\n1555\n01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,390\ndon't have time to get to it today.\n\n1556\n01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:40,930\nSo let's go ahead and wrap it up here.\n\n1557\n01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,270\nDefinitely stay tuned for the next\nWindows 8 episode as we jump into some of\n\n1558\n01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:48,740\nthe cool security features\nthat are out there.\n\n1559\n01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:52,500\nOn the topic of security,\nif you have a time on your hands.\n\n1560\n01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,520\nStay tuned this afternoon for\nour security plus show,\n\n1561\n01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,910\nMike Rodericks going to be here\nas we dive into that stuff.\n\n1562\n01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:01,760\nAs always, for more information\ncheck out our

01:19:20,437\nThe live chat doesn't work so well.\n\n1570\n01:19:20,437 --> 01:19:21,150\n>> Huh.\n>> So yeah,\n\n1571\n01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:24,930\nthose are all the options that are\navailable that I can think of off hand.\n\n1572\n01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:25,870\n>> Huh.\nYep.\n\n1573\n01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:26,440\nGreat show.\n\n1574\n01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,320\nGreat show.\n\n1575\n01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,560\nNetwork connectivity, right.\n\n1576\n01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,110\nGetting our machines to work together.\n\n1577\n01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:36,200\nAnd too bad,\nI have some of these fun games\n\n1578\n01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:40,750\nI was hoping that we'd be able to get\nto playing some network games and\n\n1579\n01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:44,640\ntaking advantage of our new found IP\n\n1580\n01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:49,570\nconfiguration settings adjustment so\nthat we can play games.\n\n1581\n01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:50,390\n>> We'll have to do that next time.\n\n1582\n01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,900\nTime around.\n\n1583\n01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,530\nWe'll do a network deployment of\nunreal tournament or something.\n\n1584\n01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,289\n>> Yeah!\n>> All right well ladies and\n\n1585\n01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:58,420\ngentlemen I hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n1586\n01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,630\nI'm Don

00:00:41,120\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Mike Roberts.\n\n4\n00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,610\n>> How y'all doing out there?\n\n5\n00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,072\n>> Today we have a fantastic show\nfull of some more Windows 8 stuff.\n\n6\n00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,980\nMike, you ready for some Windows 8?\n\n7\n00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,390\n>> Oh yeah, I'm psyched.\n\n8\n00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,310\nI am psyched.\n\n9\n00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,593\n>> Well, on our last Windows\n8 episode we've got our work\n\n10\n00:00:57,593 --> 00:01:00,455\nstations connected to the network.\n\n11\n00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:01,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, so now,\n\n12\n00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,060\nwe're gonna take it a step further and\nsecure the network.\n\n13\n00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,310\nRight, Mike?\n>> Fantastic.\n\n14\n00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,845\nFantastic.\n\n15\n00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:09,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah, we'll take a look at doing some\n\n16\n00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,470\nWindows Firewalls.\n\n17\n00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,650\nWe'll take a look at both new consoles,\nthe basic firewall console, and\n\n18\n00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,460\nthat Windows Firewall with advanced\nsecurity, then maybe we go into some IPsec\n\n19\n00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,520\nrules where we can start encrypting or at\nleast authenticating some of that traffic.\n\n20\n00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,230\nWhat else we got?\n\n21\n00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,357\n>> Exemption rules.\n\n22\n00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:27,425\n>> Some exemption rules.\n\n23\n00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:28,551\n>> A little wireless\nstuff thrown in there.\n\n24\n00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:30,120\n>> A little wireless security.\n\n25\n00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,290\nYeah, sounds fun.\n\n26\n00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:31,798\nLet's do it.\n\n27\n00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:33,180\n>> Mm-hm, good stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,270\nSo I guess the first thing was, we'll\nstart off with this Windows Firewall.\n\n29\n00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,440\nSo, Windows has a built in firewall,\nand I think it's pretty good.\n\n30\n00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,950\n>> It is, it's really good, and it's built\nin, so that makes it very convenient.\n\n31\n00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,949\nWhere you could go out and\ndownload a third-party software,\n\n32\n00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:53,060\nbut Windows comes with a pre-built\nfirewall that does a very good job.\n\n33\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,990\nSo, it's very easy to use.\n\n34\n00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,480\nIt's got two different consoles\nthat we can use, but yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,000\nWe'll start off with that.\n\n36\n00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,690\nWhen we look at our firewall.\n\n37\n00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,620\nI guess starting with Vista, it was?\n\n38\n00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,620\nPrior to this, with XP,\nwe had just a single console.\n\n39\n00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,330\nWe had our Windows Firewall console.\n\n40\n00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,602\nAnd then with Windows Vista and later we\nend up with this Windows Firewall with\n\n41\n00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:20,820\nadvanced security where they've given\nus more control over the firewall.\n\n42\n00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,910\nWe can now separate inbound and\noutbound rules and\n\n43\n00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,450\nit also brings in the IPsec console\nwhich used to be a separate tool,\n\n44\n00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,840\nis now in that Windows Firewall with\nadvanced security console which is\n\n45\n00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,920\nfantastic because\n>> When we look at firewalls,\n\n46\n00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,190\nthe first thing we've got to realize is,\nwhat a firewall is, right?\n\n47\n00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,440\nAnd you tell me.\n\n48\n00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,820\nWhat is a firewall doing?\n\n49\n00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,320\n>> Yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,960\nFirewall, right, it allows things to\npass through it based on rules, for\n\n51\n00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,780\nthe most part, right?\n\n52\n00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,510\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n53\n00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,650\nI mean when we look at our network we\nknow that when we communicate between\n\n54\n00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,230\ncomputers, we set up\na socket of protocol and\n\n55\n00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,880\nIP address and a port number.\n\n56\n00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,584\nAnd there's what?\n\n57\n00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,658\n65,535 ports.\n\n58\n00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:09,640\nAnd you can really think of each one of\nthose as a doorway into your computer.\n\n59\n00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,980\nA point that somebody could make\na connection to your computer.\n\n60\n00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,620\nSo the idea behind a firewall,\nthen, is to block all those ports.\n\n61\n00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,800\nAnd then we can make exceptions to\nonly allow the type of traffic that we\n\n62\n00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,460\nwant to come in.\n\n63\n00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,240\n>> Now with Windows Firewall, by default,\n\n64\n00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,490\nit let's anything go through it,\nlike outbound traffic, by default.\n\n65\n00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,230\nRight?\n>> Correct.\n\n66\n00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,340\nCorrect.\nSo when you look at your default,\n\n67\n00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,290\nwhen you turn that Windows Firewall on,\nby default,\n\n68\n00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,190\nall outbound traffic is gonna be allowed.\n\n69\n00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,030\nTraffic originating from your computer.\n\n70\n00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,230\nAll inbound traffic, then,\n\n71\n00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,500\nis going to be blocked to prevent\nanything from coming into your machine.\n\n72\n00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,000\nAnd also, keep in mind that return\ntraffic is not inbound traffic, right?\n\n73\n00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,110\nWhen we say that all\ninbound traffic is blocked,\n\n74\n00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,450\nwe really mean all\nunsolicited inbound traffic.\n\n75\n00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,470\nIf you request a webpage,\nthat return traffic is\n\n76\n00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,700\ncoming back into your computer but that's\ngonna be allowed cuz you asked for it.\n\n77\n00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,208\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n78\n00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,126\n>> Right.\n\n79\n00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:08,862\nWell,\n\n80\n00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:09,780\nsweet.\n\n81\n00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,590\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n82\n00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,630\nWell, talking about Windows Firewall and\nwe can fire it up.\n\n83\n00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,400\n>> Let's fire it up.\n\n84\n00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,354\nLet's do it.\n>> Take a look at it.\n\n85\n00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:22,840\n>> Nate will get that firewall setup\nhere or open up his firewall console and\n\n86\n00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,410\nwe'll take a look at what we can do.\n\n87\n00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,640\nThe idea is we're just trying to prevent\ncertain types of traffic and then we're\n\n88\n00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:36,630\ngoing to make exceptions to allow the type\nof traffic that we want to come in.\n\n89\n00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,193\nWell, we'll save that for\nthe Advanced Security Council.\n\n90\n00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:41,712\nWe'll get into the IPsec stuff then.\n\n91\n00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:42,931\n>> All right, yeah.\n\n92\n00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:47,755\nSo to fire up the firewall we\ngo to our start screen and\n\n93\n00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:52,370\nI just typed in firewall,\nclick on the Settings.\n\n94\n00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,830\nAll right there at the very top.\n\n95\n00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,400\nWindows Firewall.\n\n96\n00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,235\nAnd it brings up this fun little guy.\n\n97\n00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:02,880\nRight?\nSo we have our network location.\n\n98\n00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,535\nRight?\nSo we're right now on a private network.\n\n99\n00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:08,940\n[LAUGH]\n>> I do like the name of your network.\n\n100\n00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,270\nIs that the Chicka Bow network?\n\n101\n00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,090\nWoo hoo.\n>> Yeah,\n\n102\n00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,370\neven though I'm connected here to ITProTV,\nbut it, anyhow.\n\n103\n00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,350\nSo it's up there.\n\n104\n00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,150\nWe're connected to this one and we also\nhave the guest public networks done here.\n\n105\n00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,120\nI'm not connected to that.\n\n106\n00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we'll see it in a minute.\n\n107\n00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,380\n>> So when we look at our firewall\nwith our basic firewall the way\n\n108\n00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,050\nWindows handles firewall security is its\ngot three profiles that we can work with.\n\n109\n00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,360\nWe've got our domain profile,\nwe've got our private profile, and\n\n110\n00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,600\nthen we've got our public or\nguest profile.\n\n111\n00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,167\nAnd when you connect to a network for the\nfirst time your computer is gonna ask you,\n\n112\n00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,450\nhow do you want to classify this network?\n\n113\n00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,440\nThey've changed that in Windows 8, right?\n\n114\n00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,240\nBack in Windows 7 when you connect to\na network it'd say, do you want to\n\n115\n00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,340\nconsider this a home network, or\na work network, or a public network?\n\n116\n00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,460\nWith Windows 8 it now just says,\ndo you wanna allow sharing and discovery,\n\n117\n00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,800\nor do you not want to allow sharing and\ndiscovery?\n\n118\n00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,730\nIf you choose no,\nit's gonna apply the public profile.\n\n119\n00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,790\nIf you choose yes, I want to\nallow that sharing and discovery,\n\n120\n00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,590\nthen it's gonna apply\nyour private profile.\n\n121\n00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,830\nAnd what's cool is we can set\nup different rules, right?\n\n122\n00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,630\nBecause when I'm at work, or\nat my home network, I wanna allow remote\n\n123\n00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,720\ndesktop because I use that to connect\nto my machine in my other office, but\n\n124\n00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,740\nI want them at Starbucks I really don't\nwant anybody trying to remote desktop into\n\n125\n00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,620\nmy computer, right?\n\n126\n00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,455\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So I can allow port 3389 on my private\n\n127\n00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:43,695\nprofile, but then,\nblock 3389 on my public profile.\n\n128\n00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:47,513\nAnd then when I switch between networks,\nI don't have to go and\n\n129\n00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:48,475\nreconfigure it each time.\n\n130\n00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,233\nIt just applies the right [INAUDIBLE].\n\n131\n00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,205\n>> Yeah.\n>> Fantastic.\n\n132\n00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:51,790\nI love it.\n\n133\n00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,910\nNetwork awareness.\n\n134\n00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,770\n>> Network awareness.\n\n135\n00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,440\nExactly, exactly.\n\n136\n00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,470\n>> It's a beautiful thing.\n\n137\n00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,485\n>> Yes, it is, it's a beautiful thing.\n\n138\n00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,970\n[LAUGH]\n>> So with the Windows built-in firewall,\n\n139\n00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,840\na couple things that we'll touch on,\nall right?\n\n140\n00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,140\nFirst, how to turn it on and off.\n\n141\n00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,090\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n142\n00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,730\n>> So pretty easy to do that.\n\n143\n00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,000\nHere on the left hand side, right there.\n\n144\n00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,890\n>> Turn Windows Firewall on or off.\n\n145\n00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,270\nThat sounds like a good choice.\n\n146\n00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,100\n>> We can click and\n\n147\n00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,260\nwe can choose to turn it on or\noff based on our network location.\n\n148\n00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,580\nSo we can turn it off just for\nprivate, turn it off just for public.\n\n149\n00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,240\nAnd if we were joined to a domain,\nthen that option would be there.\n\n150\n00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,590\n>> Yeah, it'll automatically detect, if it\ndetected a main controller on the network,\n\n151\n00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,170\nthen it'll apply that domain profile.\n\n152\n00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,990\nAnd you can turn, as you guys can see,\n\n153\n00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,820\nyou can work with each\nprofile independently, right?\n\n154\n00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,590\nYou can turn one off or on.\n\n155\n00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,912\n>> There's also a little check mark there,\nif you go back to it, that said block all\n\n156\n00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:53,876\nincoming connections including those\nlisted on that allowed apps list.\n\n157\n00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,480\nSo if you were troubleshooting or\nif you thought there was a problem or\n\n158\n00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,718\nmaybe a security breach or something, and\n\n159\n00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:02,968\nyou wanted to kill all incoming\ntraffic but not have to go and.\n\n160\n00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:06,612\nDisable each rule and things like that,\nyou can just click that,\n\n161\n00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,020\nturn everything off.\n\n162\n00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,250\nNothing is allowed.\n\n163\n00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,590\nOnce you fix your problem,\nturn it back on.\n\n164\n00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,820\nSo I like that, makes it quick and easy.\n\n165\n00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,956\n>> So it's like a red button.\n\n166\n00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:16,530\n>> Yeah it is.\n>> Like an emergency button.\n\n167\n00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,390\n>> It is.\n\n168\n00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,400\n>> Right.\n\n169\n00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,600\n>> Last store, right.\n\n170\n00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,725\nJust break the glass.\n\n171\n00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:21,480\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n172\n00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,230\n>> Nice, all right, sweet.\n\n173\n00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:31,140\nSo we can also do change notification\nsettings for our own firewall.\n\n174\n00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,250\nIt's right above there,\non the left hand side.\n\n175\n00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,690\nAnd a similar menu so\nit kind of comes out in the same place.\n\n176\n00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,020\n>> It really does doesn't it.\n\n177\n00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,220\nIf you get that same option there,\n\n178\n00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,020\nthat little check mark that says notify\nme when Windows locks a new app.\n\n179\n00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,790\n>> And its convenient.\n\n180\n00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:53,370\nSo, when a new program is installed that\nWindows does not have a rule in for it.\n\n181\n00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,810\nThen, when that program tries to call out,\nit'll prompt a little box to sing, hey\n\n182\n00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:04,510\nthis program needs to access the internet,\ndo you want to block or allow this app.\n\n183\n00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,750\nAnd so, we have the choice to do it.\n\n184\n00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,660\n>> Yeah, yep, very handy.\n\n185\n00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,930\nYeah, it's nice that that pops up\nbecause you might not know why\n\n186\n00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,190\nthe app isn't working.\n\n187\n00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> And, oh, my firewall's blocking it, or\n\n188\n00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,610\nmight be some app that you\nreally didn't expect or\n\n189\n00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,540\nwant to have access to the Internet.\n\n190\n00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,390\nYou're like, no, you cannot.\n\n191\n00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,240\nYou shall not pass.\n\n192\n00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,220\nProbably another thing we should mention\nat this point since we're just getting\n\n193\n00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,555\ninto firewalls is we really don't\nwant to run more than one firewall.\n\n194\n00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:32,358\nRight?\nWhen we're talking about host-based\n\n195\n00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:33,389\nfirewalls.\n\n196\n00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,740\nWe're going to run a firewall at\nthe network level, which we cover in other\n\n197\n00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,470\nepisodes, but on your computer you\nwouldn't want to run the Windows firewall\n\n198\n00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,290\nand download ZoneAlarm and or\nsomething like that and run that firewall.\n\n199\n00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,590\nIt'll work but\nnow you've got two firewalls so\n\n200\n00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,360\nevery exception that you make you're\ngoing to have to do it on both firewalls.\n\n201\n00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,495\nWhich is just unnecessary.\n\n202\n00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:00,380\n>> Yeah some of those firewalls\nare these third party ones.\n\n203\n00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,150\nWhen you do set it up it will give\nthe option to disable Windows Firewall.\n\n204\n00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,540\nTo turning that on again to try to\nkeep from those problems right?\n\n205\n00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,310\n>> Yeah, eliminate any conflicts and\nstuff like that.\n\n206\n00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,710\nVery Good.\n\n207\n00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,070\nVery Good.\n\n208\n00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,290\n>> All right, so yeah, so sweet.\n\n209\n00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,250\nSo lets, on the allow an app or\na feature it, so\n\n210\n00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,340\nwe'll just kinda move up the list here.\n\n211\n00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,250\nSo here are all the apps so\nfar that we have rules for, right?\n\n212\n00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:36,060\nAnd there's a bunch of Microsoft services\nor built in stuff in there and everything.\n\n213\n00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,740\nAnd a real quick way, right?\n\n214\n00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,980\nTo allow let's say Hyper-V here, right?\n\n215\n00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,470\nSo we can allow it to go through\nthe firewall on the private or the public.\n\n216\n00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,880\nAnd then all the rules associated\nwith Hyper-V the program\n\n217\n00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,390\nwill then be created individually.\n\n218\n00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,280\nSo we don't have to sift through and\nfind all the individual kinda stuff.\n\n219\n00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,560\n>> And when we install additional programs\nthey should show up on this list right so\n\n220\n00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,450\nthat I can come in here and\n\n221\n00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,215\nsay I want to allow this Steam\nengine to have internet access.\n\n222\n00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:11,180\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mike, it's funny you bring that up.\n\n223\n00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,382\n[LAUGH] Cuz that is just\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n224\n00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,279\n[SOUND] [CROSSTALK] We're gonna block.\n\n225\n00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,027\n>> It's gonna block it.\n\n226\n00:11:17,027 --> 00:11:18,840\nOh, no.\n\n227\n00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,620\nOh, no.\nThat's right.\n\n228\n00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,115\nThey're still beating us in high school.\n\n229\n00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,280\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> If you remember from our\n\n230\n00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,270\nlast episode we tried everything we could\nto prevent these guys from beating Nate's\n\n231\n00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,100\nhighest score and\nI think it's still happening.\n\n232\n00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,630\n>> Yep.\n>> So\n\n233\n00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,690\nwe're just gonna block it all together.\n\n234\n00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,810\n>> Yeah, we're just gonna shut it down.\n\n235\n00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,520\n>> Cut it off.\n\n236\n00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,170\n>> So we're not gonna turn it off.\n\n237\n00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,750\nWe want people to think, wow I can,\nI'm just not sure if Steam is broken.\n\n238\n00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,828\n>> Something's not working.\n\n239\n00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:42,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Something's not working.\n\n240\n00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,110\n>> Sneaky, sneaky\n>> All right sweet.\n\n241\n00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,066\nSo to do that, right?\n\n242\n00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:51,520\nWe will go into the advanced settings.\n\n243\n00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,220\n>> Woo hoo.\n>> Now we haven't quite gotten into\n\n244\n00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,960\nWindows with advanced,\nWindows Firewall with advanced security.\n\n245\n00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,870\n>> Though we are now.\n\n246\n00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,670\n>> We are now.\n\n247\n00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,410\nIt opens up another little console window.\n\n248\n00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,900\nAnd we get more options, right?\n\n249\n00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,640\nMore granular settings to do things and\nto specifically block a program.\n\n250\n00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,960\nThis is where we need to start.\n\n251\n00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,350\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n252\n00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,250\nAnd first thing we want to point\nout is that we still only have one\n\n253\n00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,760\nfirewall, right.\n\n254\n00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,990\nTwo different consoles,\ndifferent levels of control, as Nate said.\n\n255\n00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,590\nA little more granular control with the\nWindows firewall with advanced security,\n\n256\n00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,400\nbut keep in mind it's still\nworking with one firewall.\n\n257\n00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,620\n>> All right.\n\n258\n00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,590\nSo what we're going to do here is\nwe're going to block the Steam engine.\n\n259\n00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,320\nThe client from running or\nfrom connecting but\n\n260\n00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,200\ninstead of doing the real easy, by\nthe app we're gonna log in by the ports.\n\n261\n00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,770\n>> Oh okay.\n\n262\n00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,930\nVery good.\n>> All right.\n\n263\n00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,500\n>> So in this case you would need to\nknow then what port numbers that that\n\n264\n00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,405\napplication was using.\n\n265\n00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:52,240\nWhich is why all that memorization from-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n266\n00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,870\n>> The network, episodes.\n\n267\n00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,249\nGotta know those port numbers, right?\n\n268\n00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:57,810\n>> So, steam client, right?\n\n269\n00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,490\nSo it uses proprietary stuff, right.\n\n270\n00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,550\nSo, just gonna surf on\nover here to \"Bing\".\n\n271\n00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,530\nAnd we're just gonna look for\na common TCP/IP port, so\n\n272\n00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,210\nI was already looking at it earlier today.\n\n273\n00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,450\n>> Woo hoo.\n>> So my search history,\n\n274\n00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,630\nthank you Bing for remembering, and\nright here at the top, Wikipedia.\n\n275\n00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,438\n>> You may be the one person in\nthe world that actually uses Bing.\n\n276\n00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:19,209\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just kidding Microsoft.\n\n277\n00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:22,910\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll do a Ctrl + F to open up our find\n\n278\n00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,090\nand we'll just put in Steam.\n\n279\n00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,740\nAll right so there's one right there.\n\n280\n00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,730\nAll right.\n1725, so we need to block that guy.\n\n281\n00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,000\nAnd there is one more.\n\n282\n00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,390\nAll right, and that guy there for\nthe client, right?\n\n283\n00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,010\n2700 through 2730.\n\n284\n00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,870\n>> Whew.\n>> So those\n\n285\n00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,330\nare the ports we need to block.\n\n286\n00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:41,860\n>> Okay.\n\n287\n00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,670\n>> All right.\n\n288\n00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,045\n>> Can we remember that or\ndo I need to write that down?\n\n289\n00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,020\n[LAUGH]\n>> Let's give it a shot.\n\n290\n00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,490\n>> Okay, let's try it.\n\n291\n00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,030\n>> All right.\nSo\n\n292\n00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,960\nwe're gonna block it on the outbound,\nright?\n\n293\n00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,930\nSo the outbound connections then will\nbe filtered out by Windows Firewall.\n\n294\n00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,730\nAnd if it finds stuff running on\nthat port, it's gonna block it and\n\n295\n00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,400\nshut it down.\n\n296\n00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,079\nAll right we'll right click and\nchoose new rule.\n\n297\n00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,410\nAnd so a new rule,\n\n298\n00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,090\nwe've got these different options\nto go through, right, Mike?\n\n299\n00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,150\n>> Yeah, we've got program,\nport, pre-define and custom.\n\n300\n00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,169\nAnd for program, we could go pick\nthe executable, and we could say,\n\n301\n00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:27,690\nlook any ports that particular program\ntries to use we're going to block it.\n\n302\n00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,410\nAnd that can be very handy especially\nwith applications like this where we saw\n\n303\n00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,310\nthat it actually has a range of ports in\nthe higher level ports that it might use.\n\n304\n00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,200\nAnd so instead of trying to write rules\nfor every single port that it might use,\n\n305\n00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,690\nwe can block the entire\napplication using that port rule.\n\n306\n00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,595\nI mean that's a program rule.\n\n307\n00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,886\n[COUGH]\n>> A little side note.\n\n308\n00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:54,969\nSo I've heard that opening\nup ports in the firewall,\n\n309\n00:14:54,969 --> 00:15:01,480\nso for opening up ports for\nprograms to receive traffic.\n\n310\n00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,650\nThat it's best to allow\nbased on the application,\n\n311\n00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,500\nso that way when the application is not\nrunning then the ports aren't left open.\n\n312\n00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,260\n>> Exactly\n>> And\n\n313\n00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,440\nso whenever the application runs and\nit opens as needed and shuts it down.\n\n314\n00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,650\n>> That's a very good point\nbecause when we do it by\n\n315\n00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,940\nPort number then that port is always open,\nall right?\n\n316\n00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,340\nWhether the program happens to be using it\nat that time or not if we do it by program\n\n317\n00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,980\nthen it's only when that program needs\nthat port that it's going to allow it.\n\n318\n00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,480\nYou're so smart.\n\n319\n00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,399\n>> Thanks Mike.\n\n320\n00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,012\n[LAUGH].\n\n321\n00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:34,480\nAlright so next option, right.\n\n322\n00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,670\nWe're going to skip that,\n\n323\n00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,850\nbecause we're going to run\nthrough that one in the wizard.\n\n324\n00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,100\nPredefined rules, right?\n\n325\n00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,060\nYou have a bunch of built\nin Microsoft stuff.\n\n326\n00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,330\n>> Yeah, these are really handy.\n\n327\n00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,321\nEspecially in your corporate\nenvironment when you're setting\n\n328\n00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,862\nup your networks because there's a bunch\nof pre built rules that I can use and\n\n329\n00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,349\nnot have to go in like if I\nwanna enable branch cache and\n\n330\n00:15:56,349 --> 00:16:00,086\nI'm not real I don't remember what port\nnumber that Pure Discovery HTPS uses.\n\n331\n00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:03,654\nI can come in and I can select that rule\nand I can apply it, so very handy that\n\n332\n00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:07,341\nthey've got all these pre built rules\nsaves you a lot of time, Now typically\n\n333\n00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,057\nwe will be,in the core of the matter we\nwould be doing this via group policy.\n\n334\n00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:15,001\nBut exact same wizard that you would\nsee if we wanted to create a rule that\n\n335\n00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,699\neffected all the computes\nin sales department or\n\n336\n00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,620\nall the computers in the domain.\n\n337\n00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,640\nWe can go into group policy, which we'll\ncover in another episode, and we would\n\n338\n00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,790\nsee that we can make a firewall rule,\nand it would be the exact same wizard.\n\n339\n00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,530\nThere would be no difference.\n\n340\n00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,030\n>> Oh, right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n341\n00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,140\nYou just walk right through\n\n342\n00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,500\nthe same thing.\n\n343\n00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,080\n>> Nice.\nAlright.\n\n344\n00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,290\nIn custom rule, right, custom rule gives\nyou the options to change everything.\n\n345\n00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,220\n>> Exactly.\nAll the options that you would get by\n\n346\n00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,070\ngoing through program port or predefined.\n\n347\n00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,180\nI can now do all those\ninside that custom rule.\n\n348\n00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,950\n>> Let's do custom.\n>> You want to do a custom?\n\n349\n00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:49,710\nFeeling creative.\n\n350\n00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,130\nLet's do a custom.\n\n351\n00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,660\n>> All right, so this custom rule right?\n\n352\n00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,180\nSo since we're gonna block\nbased on port right?\n\n353\n00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,462\nSo this is gonna apply to all programs.\n\n354\n00:16:59,462 --> 00:17:00,482\n>> Okay.\n\n355\n00:17:00,482 --> 00:17:04,280\nNow if we wanted to we could, what if\nwe had another program that could use\n\n356\n00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,350\nthat same port, that's when we could\nspecify program instead of port, right?\n\n357\n00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,050\nBut in this case we don't.\n\n358\n00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,701\nWe know that Steam's the only\none that's using it.\n\n359\n00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:13,980\n>> All right.\n\n360\n00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,050\nAnd protocol type, right?\n\n361\n00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,760\nSo it's UDP, right, on the list?\n\n362\n00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,107\n>> If you say so, I didn't see it.\n\n363\n00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:20,520\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n364\n00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,180\nwe are going to block specific ports,\nall right?\n\n365\n00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,760\nThey were 17, 25.\n\n366\n00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,450\n>> And as he's filling this in you saw\nthat we one, first had to pick out what\n\n367\n00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,870\nprotocol we were trying to block, and\nthen what port if we were gonna do\n\n368\n00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,560\na remote port or a local port and\nthen we could specify as he's doing here.\n\n369\n00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,850\nSeparated out with semicolons if I\nremember correctly, or is it commas?\n\n370\n00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,200\n>> Well, it was commas in the example.\n\n371\n00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,760\n>> Commas, there we go.\n\n372\n00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,110\n>> Yeah, it works.\n\n373\n00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,320\n>> We'll give it a shot.\n\n374\n00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,580\nAll right, so now we can block it based\non local port or remote port right now.\n\n375\n00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,520\nLike, local ports, right, so\nsome programs on local ports,\n\n376\n00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:06,840\nthey'll randomize their outgoing ports,\nand so, when we'd use Local port stuff.\n\n377\n00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,540\n>> When you've got a program, I think,\nthat uses the same port consistently.\n\n378\n00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,450\nOr if you're doing some of the lower\nlevel ports, the registered ports, or\n\n379\n00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,080\nthe well-known ports, where the program's\nnot gonna change what port it's using,\n\n380\n00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,820\nmaybe we do that.\n\n381\n00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,690\nIf we know on our end this steam\nengine is going to randomize up,\n\n382\n00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:28,620\nwe can make just block it like you're\ndoing at the other end on the remote side.\n\n383\n00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,730\nAnd then you'll also notice that he's\nable, he doesn't have to specify every\n\n384\n00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,310\nsingle port, like we've got in my old\neyes there, about 127000 through 27030?\n\n385\n00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,300\nSo instead of having to list out.\n\n386\n00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,060\nThirty individual ports, 27,001, 27,002.\n\n387\n00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:50,730\nHe's able to just put a dash in there or\na hyphen to indicate a range of ports.\n\n388\n00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,920\nWhich is also inclusive, right?\n\n389\n00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,140\nWe're endpoint inclusive, so that's gonna\ninclude port 2700 and port zero 30.\n\n390\n00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,680\n>> Alright.\n\n391\n00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,510\n>> You know what I'm saying?\n\n392\n00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,440\nSo sometimes with the ranges,\nyou gotta worry about whether or\n\n393\n00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,300\nnot it includes the actual endpoint or\nnot.\n\n394\n00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,737\nAnd this one does.\n\n395\n00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:08,520\n>> [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n396\n00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,090\nAlright, clicking on through.\n\n397\n00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,140\nAlright.\n\n398\n00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,290\nWhich IP addresses this will apply to,\nsince we're\n\n399\n00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,800\nrunning it on this machine right,\nwe'll just let it apply to anything.\n\n400\n00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,730\n>> Yeah.\nWe already scoped the rule.\n\n401\n00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,770\nYou might have a situation where,\nmaybe this isn't the best example, but\n\n402\n00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,730\nwhere I wanna allow certain,\nlet's say, I've got a server,\n\n403\n00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,720\nand I wanna allow FTP traffic, but\nI only wanna allow that FTP traffic\n\n404\n00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,950\nif it's coming from clients on my subnet,\nright?\n\n405\n00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,540\nSo we can specify we're gonna\nallow it from these IP addresses.\n\n406\n00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,580\nAny other IP address tries to hit that\nport via FTP and it's going to say no,\n\n407\n00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,100\nyou're not on the list.\n\n408\n00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,280\nSo we can do that or\nyou can do it the other way.\n\n409\n00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280\nYou got from and to basically in that.\n\n410\n00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,000\nSo we're going to leave it on what,\nfrom any, to any.\n\n411\n00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,990\n>> Nice.\n\n412\n00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,030\n>> All right, and then.\n\n413\n00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,710\nAll right.\nSo, then, what do we we want to do?\n\n414\n00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:08,130\nWhenever there's any traffic that matches\nthis rule, what do we want to do with it?\n\n415\n00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,060\n>> We can either allow it,\nwe can block it, or\n\n416\n00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,390\nwe can allow it if it's secure,\nwhich we'll come back to later.\n\n417\n00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,360\nSave that.\n\n418\n00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,500\n>> We're gonna just straight-up block it.\n\n419\n00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,330\nOkay, we're gonna block it.\n\n420\n00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,370\nWe don't wanna allow this type of traffic.\n\n421\n00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:21,900\n>> All right, and so\n\n422\n00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,320\nnow we go onto, which network location\nthis rule is going to apply to.\n\n423\n00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,120\n>> We've got the three profiles\nthat Windows uses, the domain,\n\n424\n00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,340\nprivate and public.\n\n425\n00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,653\nAnd I might want to block this when\nI'm connected to a public network, but\n\n426\n00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,040\nallow it when I'm connected\nto a private network.\n\n427\n00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,200\nSo we can pick and choose, or\nwe can just apply it to all three,\n\n428\n00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,190\nthat way it's always blocked.\n\n429\n00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,103\n>> Right?\nAll right,\n\n430\n00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:44,560\nwe're just going to choose private.\n\n431\n00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,810\nThat's what we're connecting to.\n\n432\n00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,370\n>> Okay.\n>> And we'll\n\n433\n00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,820\njust choose just private there.\n\n434\n00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,010\nAnd then we'll give this a name.\n\n435\n00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,722\nWe'll just call it Block Statement.\n\n436\n00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,680\nAll right, there we go.\n\n437\n00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,070\n>> And there's your new rule.\n\n438\n00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,140\n>> There's the new rule.\n\n439\n00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,760\nWell, we've got Steam up here and let's\nfire it up and see if it's gonna work.\n\n440\n00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,940\n>> See what happens.\n\n441\n00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,678\nDrum roll please.\n\n442\n00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:10,410\n>> It's like I try to open up.\n\n443\n00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,788\nLet me, maybe it was already running.\n\n444\n00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:13,675\nThere we go.\n\n445\n00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:18,155\nLooks like it's having issues.\n\n446\n00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:21,105\nWhat's going on?\n\n447\n00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:25,355\nOh no.\n>> Could not connect to the Steam network.\n\n448\n00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:27,010\n>> Oh son of a God.\n\n449\n00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,810\nSo there we go.\n\n450\n00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,960\nWindows Firewall, right?\n\n451\n00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,220\nIt recognizes the traffic going out.\n\n452\n00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,600\nIt matched the rule that we created, and\nthe action we chose was to block it, and\n\n453\n00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,120\nthere we go.\n\n454\n00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,870\nIt shut down.\n\n455\n00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,620\n>> Very good.\n\n456\n00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,520\n>> Now we did choose to\nblock it on the private.\n\n457\n00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,250\n>> On the private, yep.\n\n458\n00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,970\n>> Right, and not on the public.\n\n459\n00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,650\n>> Not on the public.\n\n460\n00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,060\n>> So,let, yeah.\n\n461\n00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,670\nLet's test that out.\n\n462\n00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,839\n>> See what happens.\n\n463\n00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,760\n>> So, we'll change our location,\nwhich is.\n\n464\n00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,855\nYep, right there under network name.\n\n465\n00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:53,557\nRight?\n\n466\n00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:55,666\nWe're set to the private network.\n\n467\n00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,072\n>> Private network, okay.\n\n468\n00:21:57,072 --> 00:21:59,980\n>> Right,and to change that,\nso I'll close this game.\n\n469\n00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:09,070\nAnd up here we can go to our connections,\nand turn sharing on or off.\n\n470\n00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,140\nAnd we will choose no.\n\n471\n00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,730\nDo not turn on sharing.\n\n472\n00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,390\n>> Very good.\n\n473\n00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:15,890\nRight?\n>> Yep.\n\n474\n00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,510\nWe'll open this back up.\n\n475\n00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,720\nWe can see that now our\nnetwork location has changed.\n\n476\n00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,940\nIt says we are on the public network.\n\n477\n00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,350\nNow, all those predefined firewall rules\nbased on our network location are changed.\n\n478\n00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,705\nSo let's run Steam.\n\n479\n00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,459\n>> Now roll.\n\n480\n00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,687\nAnd I can't tell.\n\n481\n00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:45,348\nIs it running?\n\n482\n00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:48,740\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think this happened before.\n\n483\n00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,660\nLet me.\n\n484\n00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,111\n>> Oh, did it not stop,\nfrom the first time?\n\n485\n00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:53,611\n>> Oops.\n\n486\n00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:01,712\n>> Yeah, so\nwe'll get that taken care of there.\n\n487\n00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:04,800\nHe'll drop it all together and\nthen try it one more time.\n\n488\n00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,474\nAnd it's thinking about it.\n\n489\n00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,040\n>> Hooray!\n\n490\n00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,910\n>> Yay!\n\n491\n00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,860\n>> There it goes.\n\n492\n00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,820\n>> So now we see that when we apply that\nprofile, or when we created that firewall\n\n493\n00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,120\nrule, we specified only block\nit on the private network.\n\n494\n00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,680\nSo as soon as he connected to a public\nnetwork, it was allowed, no problem.\n\n495\n00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,630\nBeautiful thing.\n\n496\n00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,490\n>> Yup, sweet.\n\n497\n00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,560\nThere you go.\n\n498\n00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,230\nThere we go.\n\n499\n00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,596\nNow, let's see.\n\n500\n00:23:33,596 --> 00:23:40,780\nAs far as blocking stuff, let's jump back\ninto Windows with advanced security.\n\n501\n00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,520\n>> And one thing we could point out while\nwe're here if we wanted to, is now we've\n\n502\n00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,410\ngot that rule and we decided that we only\nwant to block it on the private network.\n\n503\n00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,170\nSo anytime I connect to a network that's\nclassified private, it's gonna block it,\n\n504\n00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,370\ndomain public, still gonna be available.\n\n505\n00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,190\nWhat if we change our mind?\n\n506\n00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,259\nWhat if we now wanna\nblock it on all three?\n\n507\n00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:59,585\nEasy enough to go back in and\nmodify that rule.\n\n508\n00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:02,781\nWe can just go back to that\nrule where I click on it.\n\n509\n00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:05,382\nAnd go into it's properties.\n\n510\n00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:08,630\nAnd then go to our scope.\n\n511\n00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,220\nRight on our scope,\nthere we are, advanced tab.\n\n512\n00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,940\nAnd we can choose domain and\nor private and public.\n\n513\n00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,630\nAnd now it should be blocked\non all the networks.\n\n514\n00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,070\nSo easy enough to go back in if,\nyou know, you made a mistake.\n\n515\n00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,650\nOr if you want to change one\nof those firewall rules,\n\n516\n00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:30,480\nyou don't have to start all over and\ngo back through that wizard.\n\n517\n00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,537\nYou can just fire it up and\ngo in there and edit that guy.\n\n518\n00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:35,126\n>> Right on.\n\n519\n00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:37,170\nYeah, sweet.\n\n520\n00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:41,440\nSo now more in,\nsome of these other options, right?\n\n521\n00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,700\nInbound rules, I guess the opposite\nof the rule that we just created.\n\n522\n00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,230\nListen for connections coming in that are,\n\n523\n00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,460\ncomputers that are waiting on\nsomething like Remote Desktop, right?\n\n524\n00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,660\nRemote Desktop needs a firewall rule,\nright, or an exception to,\n\n525\n00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,390\nyeah it listening for\nthat traffic coming in from the outside.\n\n526\n00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,520\nIt'll pick it up and let it through.\n\n527\n00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,370\n>> Inbound traffic is traffic\nthat's destined for your computer.\n\n528\n00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,980\nRemember, not return traffic, but\ntraffic that's coming in to your computer.\n\n529\n00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,510\nSo if I'm sitting here at my computer,\nand I try to remote into your computer,\n\n530\n00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,550\nthen I'm sending out that pack and\nit's coming across port 3389.\n\n531\n00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,450\nIf you're blocking that port,\n\n532\n00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,550\nthen I'm not going to be allowed to\nmake that remote desktop connection.\n\n533\n00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,720\n>> Right.\nSo, Mike,\n\n534\n00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,060\nDo you change your remote desktop, Cort?\n\n535\n00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,930\n>> I do not.\n\n536\n00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,790\n>> No, you leave it?\n>> Nope.\n\n537\n00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,490\n>> Is it the same?\n\n538\n00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,390\n>> It's the default 4389.\n\n539\n00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,265\nI know, not very hardening of me right?\n\n540\n00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:41,910\n[LAUGH]\n>> What we talk about is our other\n\n541\n00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,630\nepisodes when we talk about hardening\nour computers and our servers.\n\n542\n00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,260\nOne of the things we talk about is\nchanging some of the default ports and\n\n543\n00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,000\nthings like that so, but\n\n544\n00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,700\nno I stick with the default 33, 89\n>> Right do you\n\n545\n00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,751\nhave it turned on on your laptop?\n\n546\n00:25:55,751 --> 00:26:01,460\n>> Let's find out here\nare your modem just confused?\n\n547\n00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,292\nIs that what you're saying?\n\n548\n00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:07,960\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, not too far off.\n\n549\n00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,457\n>> Let's see what I got here.\n\n550\n00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:18,220\nAnd it is not allowed.\n\n551\n00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,520\nDo not allow remote desktop\nconnections to this computer.\n\n552\n00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,150\n>> Sweet.\n\n553\n00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,660\nAll right.\n\n554\n00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,040\n>> Would you like me to enable it for you?\n\n555\n00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,830\n>> No.\n>> Oh okay.\n\n556\n00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,460\n>> Yeah you know what?\n\n557\n00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,960\nYeah why not?\n\n558\n00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,160\nSo, all right.\n\n559\n00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,800\n>> And unfortunately I don't\nhave my IGVA set up but\n\n560\n00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,580\nwhat I'm doing right now is I've\ngone into my system properties.\n\n561\n00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,830\nAnd I've clicked on my remote settings,\nand in your remote settings in your system\n\n562\n00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,680\nproperties you've got the option to turn\non remote assistance, which is turned on\n\n563\n00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,530\nby default in Windows 8,\nwhich is allowed by default in Windows 8.\n\n564\n00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,890\nAnd, I can allow allow remote\ndesktop connections which is not\n\n565\n00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,940\nturned on by default in Windows 8.\n\n566\n00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,540\nSo we have to go in and turn that on.\n\n567\n00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,640\nAnd what I'm doing here is I am choosing\nan option that says allow remote desktop\n\n568\n00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,130\nconnections to this computer.\n\n569\n00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,800\nAs soon as I check that a little\nwindow pops up and says that.\n\n570\n00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,140\nOh that's not the window I was looking for\nthough.\n\n571\n00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,400\nIt's telling me it is going to go to\nsleep and I have to watch out for that.\n\n572\n00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,360\nBut what's cool about it is\nwhen I select that option,\n\n573\n00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,650\nallow remote desktop connection to this\ncomputer, it's going in the background and\n\n574\n00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,270\nsetting up those firewall rules for me.\n\n575\n00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,090\nSo I could really do it either way, right?\n\n576\n00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,750\nI could come in here or\nI could go in there and\n\n577\n00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,710\nI could just open up\na firewall rule manually.\n\n578\n00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,610\nThis allows me to not have to go into my\nfirewall console and allow remote desktop.\n\n579\n00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,620\nThe next thing you know,\n\n580\n00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,840\nNate's going to be taking over my computer\nhere in a second if I don't watch it.\n\n581\n00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,510\n>> Next episode, we're going to\nget all into remote assistance.\n\n582\n00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,220\n>> Okay, fantastic.\n\n583\n00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,170\n>> Remote desktop connections,\nand all that fun stuff.\n\n584\n00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,350\nHopefully you'll have me back for\nthat one.\n\n585\n00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,160\nAnother one of my favorite topics,\nremote desktop, remote assistance.\n\n586\n00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,820\nGood stuff.\n\n587\n00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,340\n>> It is good stuff.\n\n588\n00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,350\nAll right, you know what,\nwe're coming up on break.\n\n589\n00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:56,600\nThere's a few more things to\ntouch on in Windows firewall,\n\n590\n00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,560\nthe advanced security thing.\n\n591\n00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,971\nWe'll cover those too, and then and\nwe'll move onto the exciting IP set stuff.\n\n592\n00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:06,906\n>> Looking forward to it,\nhope you guys are too.\n\n593\n00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:08,040\n>> Sweet.\n\n594\n00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,111\nAll right,\nwe'll see you back in a few minutes.\n\n595\n00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:17,344\n[MUSIC]\n\n596\n00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:20,090\nAnd welcome back.\n\n597\n00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:26,750\nAll right, so Mike, we've got a few more\nthings to touch on in Windows Firewall.\n\n598\n00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,020\nAnd yeah, I guess we'll just\njump right back into it.\n\n599\n00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,920\n>> Let's get right back into it.\n\n600\n00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,790\nSo we've covered our\nbasic Firewall console.\n\n601\n00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,030\nWe saw how we can go in there and\nuse some of those basic rules.\n\n602\n00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,010\nThen we got into our Windows Firewall\nadvanced security, where I broke it into\n\n603\n00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,560\na little more to control,\n\n604\n00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,120\nas you were saying.\n\n605\n00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,660\nWhere we blocked steam.\n\n606\n00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,640\nWe could see the difference\nbetween inbound rules and\n\n607\n00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,890\noutbound rules and\nthings like that covered all that.\n\n608\n00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,340\nAnd next, we move on into.\n\n609\n00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,730\n>> Yeah.\n>> IP sec, Nate?\n\n610\n00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,380\n>> IPsec stuff?\n\n611\n00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,440\n>> Yeah, let's do some IP sec.\n\n612\n00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,680\nDoesn't that sound fun?\n\n613\n00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,150\n>> Yep, I think so.\n\n614\n00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,660\n>> We want to make sure as\nNate's getting all this set up.\n\n615\n00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,100\nWe Firewall rules are going to allow\nthat traffic in and out of my machine.\n\n616\n00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,660\nWe can decide what's allowed to come in,\nwhat's allowed to leave, but\n\n617\n00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,970\nwe also want to be able to\nsecure some of out traffic.\n\n618\n00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,120\nSome of our traffic, when we're sending\nsensitive data and things like that,\n\n619\n00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,940\nwe might want to protect that data\nas it travels across the network.\n\n620\n00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,990\nAnd that's where IP sect comes in.\n\n621\n00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,770\nIP sect is my internet\nprotocol security and\n\n622\n00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:37,170\nthat's going to give me the ability\nto either authenticate the packets or\n\n623\n00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,685\ndo both authentication and\nencryption of those packets.\n\n624\n00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,955\nSo, that's where we'll head next,\nas Nate pulls this up.\n\n625\n00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:50,915\nAnd one of the nice things about that, one\nof the reasons we have that new console,\n\n626\n00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:55,707\nthat Windows Firewall advanced Security\nprior to Vista in fact with XP and prior\n\n627\n00:29:55,707 --> 00:30:00,297\nwe had our Windows firewall utility that\nwe could use the basic firewall console\n\n628\n00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:04,607\nand then we to work with our IP sect\npolicies we had to create a custom MMC and\n\n629\n00:30:04,607 --> 00:30:10,120\nwe had to bring in that IPSec console and\nwork with them there.\n\n630\n00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,300\nAnd now with the Windows Firewall\nadvanced security,\n\n631\n00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,900\nI've got all those options in one console.\n\n632\n00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,300\nSo I've got my firewall rules,\nmy connection security rules and\n\n633\n00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,660\nthe ability to monitor my IP Sec\nconnections that I have established\n\n634\n00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,420\nall through that one console.\n\n635\n00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,890\nVery handy.\n\n636\n00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,230\n>> One of these machines are taking\na little bit of time to fire up,\n\n637\n00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,930\nbut we can start\nconfiguring the other one.\n\n638\n00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,090\nThe client machine?\n\n639\n00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:37,970\n>> Absolutely.\n\n640\n00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,950\nAbsolutely.\n\n641\n00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,690\n>> All right, right on.\n\n642\n00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:44,070\n>> So we'll switch over to this,\nthat guy now.\n\n643\n00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:49,850\nFirst things first, so what we're going\nto do is create an IP sec rule, right,\n\n644\n00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,060\nto allow pings,\n\n645\n00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:57,320\nto go from a client machine to it's\ndomain controller, server on network.\n\n646\n00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:05,150\nBut we are only going to allow things\nif they have an IP secure connection.\n\n647\n00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,200\nRight?\nIs that how to explain it?\n\n648\n00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,275\n>> I think that sounds pretty darn good.\n\n649\n00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:10,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n650\n00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,780\nthe first place to start then will be\n>> Yeah, Windows firewall, basically.\n\n651\n00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,680\n>> Yeah\n>> Yeah you know when we get into IP sec,\n\n652\n00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,220\nyou know one of the things we've got\nto make sure we understand is that\n\n653\n00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,860\nwe create the connection security\nrules to protect that traffic.\n\n654\n00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,010\nNow we're going to be doing pings and\n\n655\n00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,850\nobviously pings are nothing I really\nneed to secure but it's a good example.\n\n656\n00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,560\nAnd.\n\n657\n00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,660\nWe've got to understand that when we\ncreate those connection security rules,\n\n658\n00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,120\nthat's going to define what type of\ntraffic we want to protect with IP sec.\n\n659\n00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,820\nWe don't want to protect every\ntype of traffic, typically.\n\n660\n00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,970\nEspecially on the client end,\n\n661\n00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,210\nthey do a lot of connections that don't\nneed to be secured or can't be secured.\n\n662\n00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,998\nSo the IP sec rules we're going to define\nwhat type of traffic I want to apply\n\n663\n00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:54,430\nthis Internet Protocol Security to,\n\n664\n00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,990\nbut the IP sec rule does not allow\nthat traffic through the firewall, so\n\n665\n00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,338\nwe have to remember that just treating\nthe IP sec rule is not enough.\n\n666\n00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,966\nIP sec rule, or connection security rule,\n\n667\n00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:10,307\nis going to define that we want to\nencrypt or authenticate this traffic.\n\n668\n00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:14,640\nWe still have to make the matching\nfirewall rule To allow that traffic to\n\n669\n00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,590\ncome through.\n\n670\n00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:19,350\nNow in our demo Nate's getting ready to\ndo here, there's already a rule set up to\n\n671\n00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,820\nallow ping traffic through the firewall,\nso we don't have to go back and do that.\n\n672\n00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,210\nAll we're gonna do is set up\nthat connection security rule.\n\n673\n00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,650\n>> Sweet, thanks Mike.\n\n674\n00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,950\nAll right, so I'm starting off.\n\n675\n00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:35,193\nWe're gonna create the IP sect rule and\nwe do that through Windows firewall with\n\n676\n00:32:35,193 --> 00:32:40,763\nadvanced security, and over here on the\nleft hand side connection security rules.\n\n677\n00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:45,779\nI will right click to put little menu and\nselect a new rule now,\n\n678\n00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:52,555\nwe've got yeah a slew of different ways to\ncreate rules based on what we're after.\n\n679\n00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,006\nSo.\n\n680\n00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,176\n>> Yeah no go ahead.\n\n681\n00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:59,680\n>> We got our isolation rules,\nand with isolation rules,\n\n682\n00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,190\nwhat we can really do,\nis we can isolate our network, or\n\n683\n00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,090\nour computers on our network\nfrom other computers.\n\n684\n00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,740\nRight if we require IP set communication,\n\n685\n00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,610\nall communication to be authenticated for\nexample.\n\n686\n00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,490\nThen if all the computers on my domain.\n\n687\n00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,140\nRequire authentication for the traffic,\nwhen a vendor comes into my network and\n\n688\n00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,260\nplugs into my network, his computer is\nnot set up with a matching IPsec policy,\n\n689\n00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,980\nso he's not gonna be able to communicate\nwith any of the computers on my network.\n\n690\n00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,480\nNow you can still use my network to\naccess the internet or whatever, but\n\n691\n00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,000\nhe won't be able to communicate\nwith any of my computers.\n\n692\n00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,580\nSo that's what they mean by isolation.\n\n693\n00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:40,150\nwe're isolating our computers from other\nmachines that can [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK],\n\n694\n00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:45,946\nauthentication exemption yeah we're\ngonna that a little bit right?\n\n695\n00:33:45,946 --> 00:33:50,808\n>> Yeah we'll touch on that so we can\nallow yeah set up rules to allow certain\n\n696\n00:33:50,808 --> 00:33:53,714\nkinds of traffic based on all these other.\n\n697\n00:33:53,714 --> 00:33:59,440\nCondition's, and then we can set up, yeah,\nauthentication exemption to allow certain\n\n698\n00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,330\nthings, even though there's a big rule,\nwe can let some stuff get through that,\n\n699\n00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:07,660\neither it can't authenticate, or based\non whatever condition we need to set.\n\n700\n00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,340\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n701\n00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,080\nThen we got our server-to-server type\nIPv6 rules that we can set up, so\n\n702\n00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,360\nif we want to communicate or\nprotect DNS replication for example.\n\n703\n00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,870\nWe got a standard primary,\nstandard secondary DNS server.\n\n704\n00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,510\nThey're gonna do some zone replication and\nwe can set up servers,\n\n705\n00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,538\nwe can protect that traffic.\n\n706\n00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:26,290\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n707\n00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,330\nthen you have all those big words.\n\n708\n00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,090\n>> Sorry, sorry.\n\n709\n00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,960\nWe haven't covered DNS yet\n\n710\n00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,279\nin our so we're gonna get to\nthat if we haven't, I promise.\n\n711\n00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:37,820\n>> Good stuff.\n\n712\n00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,490\nYeah.\n\n713\n00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,950\nTunnel rules.\n\n714\n00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,430\nTunnel rules would be more like\na site to site kind of ipsec tunnel\n\n715\n00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:48,880\nwhere we need to\ncommunicate over untrusted.\n\n716\n00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,670\nI guess we were doing ipsec tunnel.\n\n717\n00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,460\n>> You can set up a ton of rules\nstraight from two computers.\n\n718\n00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,100\nOr we could, as you were saying,\nwe could do an ipsec tunnel,\n\n719\n00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,950\nbetween a corporate office and\na branch office.\n\n720\n00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,660\nRather than have to set up separate ipsec,\ncommunicable\n\n721\n00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,560\nrules between every computer that's at the\ncorporate office and the branch office.\n\n722\n00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,880\nCuz we could have one tunnel but\nthat's not really done through here.\n\n723\n00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,350\nWe'd be doing that on the routers\nmost likely would be our\n\n724\n00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,110\nend points on those tunnels.\n\n725\n00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,350\n>> Yeah we're gonna get into\nVPN somewhere down the line.\n\n726\n00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,300\nAnd so then we can set up a ipsec\nVPN when we get into those topics.\n\n727\n00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,940\n>> Absolutely.\n\n728\n00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,180\nSounds fun.\n>> All right, so for our purposes, right,\n\n729\n00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,800\nwe are going to choose a, custom rule,\nwhere we just choose whatever we want.\n\n730\n00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,880\n>> Just with our firewall,\nsame thing, right.\n\n731\n00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,490\nWe've got all these options\nthat we can choose, or\n\n732\n00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,900\nif we just go down to custom, that gives\nus the ability to pick and choose,\n\n733\n00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,310\nthere's nothing predefined in there.\n\n734\n00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,160\nWe can pick any option we want.\n\n735\n00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,700\n>> All right, so\nin these endpoints here right, and\n\n736\n00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,600\nwe for this demo that we're gonna do.\n\n737\n00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,260\nWe want to authenticate ping traffic,\nright?\n\n738\n00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,300\nICMP, coming to this domain controller.\n\n739\n00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,830\nSo we're just going to, so\nthe end points are just gonna be any.\n\n740\n00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,560\nWe won't specify any.\n\n741\n00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,821\n>> We won't specify any\nparticular whatnot's all right so\n\n742\n00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:15,920\nnow we get right I guess how\nrigid do we want the rules to be?\n\n743\n00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,860\n>> With the ipsec rules we're looking\nat here, we get three options for\n\n744\n00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,190\nwhat we're gonna require\nin this ipsec connection.\n\n745\n00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,110\nWe've got request authentication for\ninbound and outbound, require for inbound,\n\n746\n00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:35,250\nrequest outbound, or require both inbound\nand outbound, or no authorization at all.\n\n747\n00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,190\nAnd what that means is if it's a request,\nif I set on my computer\n\n748\n00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:44,200\nto request authentication for inbound and\noutbound, that means any time somebody\n\n749\n00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,710\ntries to make a connection to my computer,\nI'm gonna say hey, let's authenticate it.\n\n750\n00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,960\nMy computer's gonna respond by\nsaying let's authenticate it.\n\n751\n00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,320\nIf the other end says yes,\nthen we'll authenticate that traffic.\n\n752\n00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,060\nIf the other end says no I don't\nunderstand what you're talking about,\n\n753\n00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,220\nthis authentication thing,\nthen my computer says okay,\n\n754\n00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,090\nI'll talk to you anyway,\nit was just a request.\n\n755\n00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,640\nIf we set it to require authentication for\ninbound, request authentication for\n\n756\n00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,220\noutbound, and then you guys can probably\nfigure out what's gonna happen, right?\n\n757\n00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,930\nIf anything that's coming into my\ncomputer, it's set to require.\n\n758\n00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,620\nIf the other end says, I don't understand\nipsec, then my computer's gonna say,\n\n759\n00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,140\nno, you don't get to talk to me then,\nI'm required authentication for inbound.\n\n760\n00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,330\nOutbound is still just a request and\n\n761\n00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,652\nthen that third option is require for\nboth inbound and outbound.\n\n762\n00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:32,240\nOn a highly secure server\nthat had sensitive data where\n\n763\n00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,750\nanybody that connected to it,\nwe would want to maybe choose that option.\n\n764\n00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,470\nNot the best option usually on\na client Machine because, again,\n\n765\n00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,060\nclients do a lot of things that\naren't gonna require ipsec right\n\n766\n00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,080\nthey browse the internet and\nthings like that.\n\n767\n00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,940\nUsually, you don't see that\noption set on the client.\n\n768\n00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,902\nBut on a very high,\nhighly secure work station, they maybe.\n\n769\n00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:55,700\nAll right, very first one, right?\n\n770\n00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,010\nSo request authentications for\ninbound and outbound.\n\n771\n00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,990\nIf it's saying hey, let's authenticate and\nsecure this traffic and\n\n772\n00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,450\nthe other guy's nah, let's not, okay well.\n\n773\n00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,720\nHere's the traffic anyways.\n\n774\n00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,160\nSo then, why would you wanna do\nthat if you're gonna go through\n\n775\n00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,360\nthe setting up rules, but\nit's not gonna use it.\n\n776\n00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:20,210\n>> What if I've got a server that has\nsome sensitive data on it, right?\n\n777\n00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,310\nWhen I connect to that server,\nI need to set up ipsec.\n\n778\n00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,960\nBut when I connect to the printer, when I\nconnect to the web server, when I connect\n\n779\n00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,580\nto these other things, I don't\nnecessarily want to protect that data.\n\n780\n00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,280\nI don't want to authenticate that.\n\n781\n00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,000\nSo that request means,\nwhen my computer tries to connect to that\n\n782\n00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,040\nserver that has that sensitive information\non it, he's gonna request authentication.\n\n783\n00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,990\nThe server's gonna say.\n\n784\n00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,530\nThe server's probably set\nto require authentication.\n\n785\n00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,720\nMy computer's gonna try to connect, and\nhe's gonna request authentication and\n\n786\n00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,100\nthen, the server's gonna say, yes.\n\n787\n00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,510\nLet's authenticate it and\nI'll be able to connect.\n\n788\n00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,440\nBut then, when my computer connects to\nthe corporate web server that doesn't\n\n789\n00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,190\nrequire authentication,\nit's just a request, so\n\n790\n00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,800\nI'll still be able to connect even though\nthe server doesn't respond with ipsec.\n\n791\n00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,920\n>> Okay.\n\n792\n00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,700\nIf you have more than one type of\ntraffic then that's trying to use.\n\n793\n00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,590\nWhatever this rule is set up to do.\n\n794\n00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,700\nYou don't just bar the whole...\n\n795\n00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,385\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n796\n00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:18,970\nCuz ipsec does add some overhead, right?\n\n797\n00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,940\nWe're gonna have to encrypt or\nauthenticate, either authenticate, or\n\n798\n00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,870\nauthenticate and encrypt, every single\npacket that's coming in and out.\n\n799\n00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,950\nIt does make the packets\na little bit larger, so\n\n800\n00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,590\nwe don't wanna just blanket throw\nipsec on everything typically,\n\n801\n00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,240\njust the information that that's\ngonna require that security.\n\n802\n00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,820\n>> All right,\n\n803\n00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,810\nI was making sure the domain kicked in\nonce that domain control turned on so.\n\n804\n00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,960\nAll right perfect so we can, continue on.\n\n805\n00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,900\nAll right,for this one, all right, so this\nis, so now we are on the main controller.\n\n806\n00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,240\nWhich one should we put it on?\n\n807\n00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,350\n>> Well, for the main one,\nit really doesn't matter.\n\n808\n00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,760\nYou can do on my server, I would probably.\n\n809\n00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,830\nThis is a domain controller, so for\n\n810\n00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,880\nthe lab purposes, let's just do\nrequest authentication for inbound and\n\n811\n00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,830\noutbound, so we don't goof anything\nelse that's going on out there.\n\n812\n00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,500\n>> All right.\nRight on.\n\n813\n00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,920\nAll right, so we will request,\nmoving right along.\n\n814\n00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,547\n>> All right, so\nwhat kind of authentication, right?\n\n815\n00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:21,302\nIt's requesting authentication,\nright, to set this up.\n\n816\n00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:23,543\n>> Yep.\n>> So, what kind?\n\n817\n00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:28,155\nSo, we have default, right,\nand we can set that.\n\n818\n00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:30,970\nGet back and, we'll see,\nthere is an option.\n\n819\n00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,843\n>> We're going to set up\nthese IP settings, and\n\n820\n00:40:36,843 --> 00:40:43,090\nthese are like global settings for\n> Correct.\n\n821\n00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,570\nAnd then we can set\nthe IP set defaults and,\n\n822\n00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,630\nof course, a default in a default setting.\n\n823\n00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,760\n[LAUGH] But anyway we can go through\nadvance and set what exactly is a default.\n\n824\n00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,980\nI suppose if you add certain\npolicies in place or something\n\n825\n00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,100\nthat you're required to do over something,\nthen you just set it up beforehand?\n\n826\n00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,060\n>> Yeah.\nAnd as Nate was saying,\n\n827\n00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,910\nit really is a global setting so\nif I want to\n\n828\n00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,930\nwhere I don't have to worry to much about\nwhen I create all these different rules,\n\n829\n00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,110\nI don't have to worry about picking the\nauthentication protocol, I can just leave\n\n830\n00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,000\nit on default, because it's already\nbeen set at the server level there.\n\n831\n00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,080\n>> Or not at really the server\n>> Server level but at the IP sec level.\n\n832\n00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,860\nYou can leave it on default,\nor what if most of my rules\n\n833\n00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,780\ndo Kerberos so that's my default, so\nI don't have to pick it here, but\n\n834\n00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,990\noccasionally I want to use just computer\nauthentication with Kerberos, so\n\n835\n00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,260\nI can still come in here and\nchange that and not use the default.\n\n836\n00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,420\n>> All right.\n\n837\n00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,750\nSo computer end user Kerberos so we can\nauthenticate the computer all right,\n\n838\n00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,800\nordering well this one computer and\nuser or just the computer.\n\n839\n00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,660\n>> Kerberos version five getting\nthe authentication protocol we\n\n840\n00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,130\nuse on our windows environments, and if I\nwant to authenticate both the computer and\n\n841\n00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,230\nthe user, or just the computer.\n\n842\n00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,130\nOne thing we do have to keep in mind\nis that Kerberos being our domain\n\n843\n00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:09,454\nauthentication protocol is only going\nto be available for domain members.\n\n844\n00:42:09,454 --> 00:42:13,741\n>> [CROSSTALK] So if you've got vendors\nthat come in, sales reps that come in,\n\n845\n00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:16,939\nthey would not be able to\nauthenticate using Kerberos so\n\n846\n00:42:16,939 --> 00:42:18,928\nthey would not be able to connect.\n\n847\n00:42:18,928 --> 00:42:22,964\nNow we have to set up something else\nbecause you might cover another episode\n\n848\n00:42:22,964 --> 00:42:26,830\nwhere we use certificates for\nauthentication or something like that.\n\n849\n00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,305\n>> All right so\nKerberos would be like domain stuff.\n\n850\n00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:31,120\n>> Just for the domain users or\nthe domain computers.\n\n851\n00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,840\n>> have your domain member [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Sweet, which these computers are,\n\n852\n00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,270\nPart of the domain perfect.\n\n853\n00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,354\n>> And\nwe have an of advance [CROSSTALK] so\n\n854\n00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:42,387\nif none of these others quite fit what\nyou're after, we can always go in\n\n855\n00:42:42,387 --> 00:42:46,088\nthe advanced setting [CROSSTALK]\nWe can do first authentication,\n\n856\n00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:50,568\nsecond authentication\n>> And you specify what kind for both,\n\n857\n00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,300\nright.\n\n858\n00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,660\nWe've got the Curbrow stuff again.\n\n859\n00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,500\nThis Net Lanman.\n\n860\n00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,380\n>> Older authentication protocol\nfrom Windows that you really want to\n\n861\n00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,800\nstay away from.\n\n862\n00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,560\n>> Right.\n\n863\n00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,824\n>> And then that third option is typically\nwhy you are going to use that advanced\n\n864\n00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:06,565\nbutton.\n\n865\n00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:11,550\nIt's because I've got people or computers\nthat need to connect that are not domain\n\n866\n00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,230\nmembers and in here I can choose\nthat certificates option.\n\n867\n00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,910\nAnd we can issue certificates\nfrom our certificate authority,\n\n868\n00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,150\nwhich again will be covered\nin another episode.\n\n869\n00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,220\nAnd we can use those for\nthe identification.\n\n870\n00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,780\nBecause that sales person\nthat's visiting my shop\n\n871\n00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,290\ndoesn't have an account\nin my active directory.\n\n872\n00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,810\nHis computer is not a member of my domain.\n\n873\n00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,940\nSo they're not going to be able to\nuse Kerberos for authentication.\n\n874\n00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,770\nBut I could issue them a certificate that\nthey could install on their computer,\n\n875\n00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,410\nor a user certificate they\ncould put on a smart card, and\n\n876\n00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,030\nthen they could use that to authenticate.\n\n877\n00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,110\n>> Mm-hm.\nRight?\n\n878\n00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,080\nYeah, shoot.\n\n879\n00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,726\nThat sounds like that would be\na little bit of a set up, right?\n\n880\n00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:48,990\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n881\n00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:53,600\nAnd we'll cover more of that after we\ndo our certification authority episode.\n\n882\n00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,510\n>> All right.\n\n883\n00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:02,890\nHealth certificates, more like network\naccess protection kind of thing.\n\n884\n00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,680\nWe've got certificate\naccount mapping right,\n\n885\n00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,950\nlike certificate chains of some kind.\n\n886\n00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:14,600\n>> Yeah, you can tie certificate to\na user account, and map it that that way.\n\n887\n00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,148\nA nap or, no wait now.\n\n888\n00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:21,230\n[LAUGH]\n>> I panicked there for a minute,\n\n889\n00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,605\nlike oh my gosh, wait.\n\n890\n00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:27,310\n>> [LAUGH] Is it narcolepsy when\n>> Fall asleep, right, standing up?\n\n891\n00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:32,420\nSo yeah, we can use certificates, and\n\n892\n00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,870\nmath is a fantastic concept as well,\nnetwork access protection,\n\n893\n00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:42,870\nand we'll cover that in another episode,\nbut we could set it up to where, not only\n\n894\n00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,550\ndo you need a certificate to authenticate,\nbut it's a specific certificate.\n\n895\n00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,660\nA certificate from my\nnetwork access protected,\n\n896\n00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,905\nwell actually a certificate from\nthe health registration authority.\n\n897\n00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:53,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, that's for another day, right?\n\n898\n00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,486\nWe don't want to get into that.\n\n899\n00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,715\n>> .Yeah, I mean, yeah.\n\n900\n00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:57,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n901\n00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,770\nquite a bit of\n>> I just set up in a lot of steps that\n\n902\n00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,450\ninvolve for.\n\n903\n00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,970\n>> Not something that you're gonna do\nin a small network, in little SoHo or\n\n904\n00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,120\nsomething like that.\n\n905\n00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,120\nBecause you're not running\na certificate authority, right.\n\n906\n00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,050\nYou're not issuing certificates\nto all your user computers.\n\n907\n00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:13,107\nSo Kerberos is by far\nthe simplest way to go.\n\n908\n00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:17,151\nLarger corporate environments, that's\nwhen we may get into the certificates and\n\n909\n00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:19,030\nother authentication methods.\n\n910\n00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,850\n>> We have an even simpler way.\n\n911\n00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:25,854\nThe last option on here is\nto use a pre-shared key.\n\n912\n00:45:25,854 --> 00:45:26,940\n>> A pre-shared key.\n\n913\n00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,440\n>> Right, and a pre-shared key could\njust be whatever as long as it matches\n\n914\n00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,025\non both sides.\n\n915\n00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:33,400\n>> Mm-hm,\nwhich would be another option for\n\n916\n00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,920\npeople that weren't part\nof my domain as well.\n\n917\n00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,120\nBecause when they come in, and\nif I know this vendor, And\n\n918\n00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,690\nI'm okay with them connecting.\n\n919\n00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,260\nI could give them that pre-shared key and\nthey could enter that in.\n\n920\n00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,418\nAnd then they share it with all their\nfriends, and there goes my security so.\n\n921\n00:45:45,418 --> 00:45:48,770\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, for\n\n922\n00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,830\nthis example, we're gonna cancel out\nthese menus, and for this example,\n\n923\n00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,930\nwe are going to use this computer and\nuser to bring it all the way back.\n\n924\n00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:55,740\n>> I like that, actually.\n\n925\n00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,902\nYep.\n\n926\n00:45:56,902 --> 00:46:01,240\nAll right now, which ports or protocols,\nright, for this, for this rule.\n\n927\n00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,640\nNow we are going to do pings,\n\n928\n00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,740\nit’s an easy thing to test on two virtual\nmachines that we have right here.\n\n929\n00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,110\n>> If we left it on any there,\n\n930\n00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:12,900\nthat means that all traffic\nwould require authentication.\n\n931\n00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,330\nWe're going to be a little more\nspecific and choose what we want.\n\n932\n00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,200\n>> That would be a lot of\nexceptions rules, right?\n\n933\n00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,800\n>> Yes, that would be a lot of exceptions.\n\n934\n00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,620\nWe'd have to worry about DNS and DHCP,\nand logging in with active trajectory,\n\n935\n00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,460\nyou know and things like that.\n\n936\n00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,060\nSo let's be a little more specific.\n\n937\n00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,070\n>> All right, so\nhe's going to choose IP and ICMPV4\n\n938\n00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,320\n>> Internet control message protocol,\n\n939\n00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,455\nwhich you guys covered in your\nnetwork episode, networking.\n\n940\n00:46:35,455 --> 00:46:36,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n941\n00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,450\n>> We've got, so nothing in.\n\n942\n00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,910\nNow we're back to our,\noh wait, go back one second.\n\n943\n00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,235\nLet's take a peak at one more\nthing while we're in there.\n\n944\n00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:50,115\n>> When he specified ICNPV4 for\nthe protocol type, yep, you're good there.\n\n945\n00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:50,965\n>> Okay, am I right?\n\n946\n00:46:50,965 --> 00:46:52,345\n>> ICNPV4.\n\n947\n00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:53,825\nAnd then for the.\n\n948\n00:46:53,825 --> 00:46:56,070\n>> Oh,\nthat's not the screen I was thinking of.\n\n949\n00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:56,710\n>> Nevermind.\n\n950\n00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,920\n>> All right.\n>> Continue on.\n\n951\n00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,465\n>> Sweet, thanks Mike.\n\n952\n00:46:58,465 --> 00:46:59,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Moving right along.\n\n953\n00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,855\nAll right, so now, we're back\nagain to these network locations.\n\n954\n00:47:02,855 --> 00:47:04,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, I mean, wow,\n\n955\n00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,790\nwe could really set some things up\nbeforehand, or make things easier by.\n\n956\n00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,110\n>> Yeah, when you set up this IP SEC rule,\n\n957\n00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:16,640\nagain, do I wanna apply this to my domain,\nmy private, or my public profile?\n\n958\n00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,340\n>> So, what we're setting up here says\nwhen I try to ping this domain controller,\n\n959\n00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,700\nin our case, we're gonna use a client and\n\n960\n00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,320\ndomain controller,\nI want to authenticate that traffic.\n\n961\n00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,990\nWell, if I go home, and I try to ping\none of my computers on my home network,\n\n962\n00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,070\nit's not set up with\nthe same IP sec policies.\n\n963\n00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,530\nIt's not a member of my domain,\nand so my ping would fail.\n\n964\n00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:40,800\n>> So, I might not want to apply\nthat rule on my private profile and\n\n965\n00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,300\nthings like that.\n\n966\n00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,370\nSo we can pick and choose which\nprofile we're applying this to.\n\n967\n00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:47,200\nSo I guess like I said if you have\na mobile computer like a laptop,\n\n968\n00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,180\nthen that, you take to work,\nyou also, you know,\n\n969\n00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,630\nbring it home and\nit's not locked at your house.\n\n970\n00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,410\n>> We're seeing that more and\n\n971\n00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,150\nmore now a days in our networks\nwith the whole BYOD, right?\n\n972\n00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,310\nBring your own device\n>> So and, so I got to be able to, and\n\n973\n00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:04,280\nWindows makes it easy to switch back and\nforth between the different profiles so.\n\n974\n00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,020\n>> Great network awareness\n>> network awareness\n\n975\n00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,759\n>> All right, so\n\n976\n00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,920\nwe're going to choose the name, right.\n\n977\n00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,450\n>> Finance.\n[LAUGH] They are aware.\n\n978\n00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,080\nWe've got to watch them.\n\n979\n00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,640\n>> And we, so we're just going\nto call this, IP sec ping.\n\n980\n00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,120\n>> OK.\n>> And finished.\n\n981\n00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,791\nSo there we go.\nAnd\n\n982\n00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,877\nwe'll go back to our security rules and\nthere we go.\n\n983\n00:48:21,877 --> 00:48:25,778\nAll right it is created and\nit is automatically enabled, so\n\n984\n00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:27,343\nready to rock and roll.\n\n985\n00:48:27,343 --> 00:48:28,592\n>> Yep.\n\n986\n00:48:28,592 --> 00:48:30,177\nEasy enough to disable if\nwe want to troubleshoot.\n\n987\n00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:33,726\nWe can right click on it and\nturn that rule off,\n\n988\n00:48:33,726 --> 00:48:36,970\nbut it is enabled once we created it.\n\n989\n00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,400\n>> Yep.\nNow the second part that\n\n990\n00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,450\nyou mentioned earlier, it's kind of\na little partner relationship, right, so\n\n991\n00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,570\nwe have to have the connection\nsecurity rules.\n\n992\n00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,110\nAnd then we need to configure\nthe correct rule for the firewall.\n\n993\n00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:48,670\n>> Right.\n\n994\n00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,145\nBecause when you set up that connection\nsecurity rule, you're specifying what type\n\n995\n00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:54,376\nof traffic that you want to\nauthenticate in this case.\n\n996\n00:48:54,376 --> 00:48:58,498\nBut that's not creating a rule\nto allow through the firewall,\n\n997\n00:48:58,498 --> 00:49:01,919\neven if we say I want to\nauthenticate IPV4 traffic,\n\n998\n00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:07,158\nwhen it gets to the firewall the firewall\nsays, I'm not letting that through.\n\n999\n00:49:07,158 --> 00:49:10,067\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And just the opposite, if I allowed it\n\n1000\n00:49:10,067 --> 00:49:13,225\nthrough the firewall but didn't set\nup my connection security rule it,\n\n1001\n00:49:13,225 --> 00:49:16,340\nwould allow it through but\nit would not be authenticated.\n\n1002\n00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,590\nAgain, one of the reasons we have\ncombined those into one console\n\n1003\n00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,110\nis because we really need to\ndo both when we set this up.\n\n1004\n00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,270\nWe've gotta set up our ipsec rule.\n\n1005\n00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:27,590\nOr our connection security rules\nthey like to call it now, and\n\n1006\n00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,900\nwe also have to set up our firewall rule.\n\n1007\n00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,420\n>> Sweet.\n\n1008\n00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,640\n>> Which I believe we're gonna\ngo ahead and create one.\n\n1009\n00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,270\n>> Yup.\n\n1010\n00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,090\nOn the inbound right?\n\n1011\n00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:38,190\nSo we're expecting the ping\ncoming inbound, right?\n\n1012\n00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,860\n>> Correct.\n>> So correct and similar to what we did\n\n1013\n00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:49,690\nby blocking the, the steam map and\nthis time we will do port.\n\n1014\n00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,060\n>> We'll go port based rule.\n\n1015\n00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,920\n>> Actually.\nAnd there are some.\n\n1016\n00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,190\n>> let's go back.\n\n1017\n00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,930\n>> Do a little custom.\n\n1018\n00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,360\nYeah, I like customs.\n\n1019\n00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,880\nCustom just gives you the ability\nto go through each option and, and\n\n1020\n00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,230\nreally specify what you want.\n\n1021\n00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,760\nNow, there are some pre-built rules\nthat we could have used, right?\n\n1022\n00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,240\nI mean, there, there are some in there\nthat we could pick from and, but\n\n1023\n00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,677\nthere might not be a specific\nas we want them to be.\n\n1024\n00:50:08,677 --> 00:50:12,429\nThat's one thing to keep in mind, when you\nuse those pre-built rules, look at all\n\n1025\n00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:16,309\nthe options and make sure you're okay with\neverything that it's that's allowing.\n\n1026\n00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:22,501\n>> So we got our ICNP, which rules\nlike our connection security rules,\n\n1027\n00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:27,215\nwe're going to match what we set in there,\nso we'll\n\n1028\n00:50:27,215 --> 00:50:29,640\n>> Get it open from ending to ending.\n\n1029\n00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,850\n>> Ending, and this is where\nit changes from the steam app\n\n1030\n00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,520\n>> That's a cool option, isn't it?\n\n1031\n00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,790\nI like that.\n>> Allow this connection, if it's secure.\n\n1032\n00:50:38,128 --> 00:50:40,570\n>> That's nice.\n\n1033\n00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,145\n>> That is nice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1034\n00:50:41,145 --> 00:50:44,880\n[LAUGH] All right, so rather than\njust open up a hole in that firewall,\n\n1035\n00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,180\nwe're gonna say we're gonna allow this,\nin this case ICMP traffic, but\n\n1036\n00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,220\nonly if it's secure.\n\n1037\n00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,050\nIf it's not secure, and it's not allowed.\n\n1038\n00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,100\n>> And\nthen we can customize it even further.\n\n1039\n00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,985\nAllow the connection if\nit's authenticated, and\n\n1040\n00:50:59,985 --> 00:51:04,862\nintegrity protected require\nthe connections to be encrypted,\n\n1041\n00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:08,308\nright, gonna sound\na little bit of the same.\n\n1042\n00:51:08,308 --> 00:51:12,268\n>> Man, my eyes are getting old,\nwhen we look at ipsec,\n\n1043\n00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:15,704\none of the things we\nshould probably mention.\n\n1044\n00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:20,250\nI don't think we have yet, we do have\ntwo different modes we can run that in.\n\n1045\n00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:24,420\nWe can run,\nwe can apply Authentication header,\n\n1046\n00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,810\nwhich is what we're doing here, we're\nrequiring authentication on these packets.\n\n1047\n00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:31,200\nThere's also ESP encapsulating\nsecurity payload.\n\n1048\n00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,560\nWhich is when I want to not only\nauthenticate but encrypt, cuz,\n\n1049\n00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,440\nwe should point out I suppose at this\npoint, we are requiring authentication,\n\n1050\n00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,190\nthat is not encrypting the traffic, right?\n\n1051\n00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,846\nAll we're doing is we're saying the source\nand the destination have to be able to\n\n1052\n00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:49,295\nidentify each other, make sure I'm\ntalking to who I think I'm talking to and\n\n1053\n00:51:49,295 --> 00:51:52,668\nnot some Rogue domain controller or\nsomething like that.\n\n1054\n00:51:52,668 --> 00:51:56,586\nThe other options there\nare if we want to encrypt it,\n\n1055\n00:51:56,586 --> 00:52:00,785\nwe can choose to apply encryption\nto the packet as well.\n\n1056\n00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,011\n>> Right.\nThen override block rules, so\n\n1057\n00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:06,760\nif there's something that is\njust absolutely critical,\n\n1058\n00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,668\nthat you don't want anything to get\nblocked or get locked out of something.\n\n1059\n00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:16,008\n>> Some other admin might end up creating\na firewall rule that ends up blocking this\n\n1060\n00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,080\ntype of traffic mistakenly.\n\n1061\n00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,980\nAnd this would ensure that even\nif that was the case it would\n\n1062\n00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,820\nstill allow this type of traffic.\n\n1063\n00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,590\n>> Right, we'll leave it at the default.\n\n1064\n00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,570\nThe very first one.\n\n1065\n00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:29,419\nMoving right along, authorize users and\nexceptions, we'll just leave this open.\n\n1066\n00:52:29,419 --> 00:52:30,278\n>> That's okay.\n\n1067\n00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:34,140\n>> For anybody to come in,\nand same with computers.\n\n1068\n00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,180\nSo, we could do it by user and\nby computer.\n\n1069\n00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,590\n>> Nice to know that we can get\nvery specific, though, where,\n\n1070\n00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,450\nin situations

or,\n\n1074\n00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,980\nas we're doing,\nwe can be pretty general and wide open.\n\n1075\n00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,500\nAnd then same thing with the profiles.\n\n1076\n00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,000\nWhich one do you wanna apply it to?\n\n1077\n00:52:59,932 --> 00:53:01,516\nGive it some funky name.\n\n1078\n00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:04,990\nAlways

descriptive names, so\n\n1083\n00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,630\nthat other administrators know\nwhat the heck we're doing.\n\n1084\n00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:27,880\n>> All right, okay, sweet so\nwe have created the firewall rule, right,\n\n1085\n00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,350\nto allow those things to come\nin only if it is secured.\n\n1086\n00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,700\nWe're right up on the break,

it.\n\n1129\n00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,500\nLet's prove to them that, we're not lying.\n\n1130\n00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,752\n>> Yep, never.\n\n1131\n00:55:31,752 --> 00:55:35,430\nAll right so we're

on break, so\nwe might have left something back on here.\n\n1137\n00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,020\nLet's see.\n\n1138\n00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,210\nSwitch back over to DC.\n\n1139\n00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,430\nWe probably didn't set\nthat back to require.\n\n1140\n00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,880\nSo let's go modify that connection.\n\n1141\n00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,110\nWe'll modify this connection security.\n\n1142\n00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:06,720\nWe'll set it back up to where it's\ngoing to require a, inbound and\n\n1143\n00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,840\noutbound authentication.\n\n1144\n00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,501\nAnd once we do that,\nthen we can flip back over to that client.\n\n1145\n00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:17,250\nAt this point, in order to get our head\nwrapped around where we were, then,\n\n1146\n00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:22,078\nour domain controller in this case,\nhas been configured with a firewall rule\n\n1147\n00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:25,220\nthat says to allow pings\nonly if they're secure.\n\n1148\n00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:28,499\nAnd we've set up a connection\nsecurity rule that says And\n\n1149\n00:56:28,499 --> 00:56:33,075\nwe've modified it to be all three\nprofiles, domain, private, and public and\n\n1150\n00:56:33,075 --> 00:56:38,290\nthat says that it's gonna require\nauthentication for ICMPD4 traffic.\n\n1151\n00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,550\nThen you flip over to the client, we\nattempt to ping the domain controller and\n\n1152\n00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,320\nas you can see,\nwe get our request timed out.\n\n1153\n00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,870\n>> Yup.\n>> Because that's an important part of\n\n1154\n00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:53,160\nIPsec is, both ends of the conversation\nhave to be setup to use IPsec.\n\n1155\n00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,020\nThink of it like a language,\nif one end knows the language but\n\n1156\n00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:00,060\nthe other end doesn't There's no\ncommunications that are going to occur.\n\n1157\n00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:04,590\nIf both ends aren't set up with a policy\nyou won't be able to communicate.\n\n1158\n00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,460\nSo that's our next step then, right?\n\n1159\n00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,778\nIs to set up our client with a matching\npolicy to connect over to that domain.\n\n1160\n00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:13,888\n>> All right so yeah.\n\n1161\n00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:18,780\nTo jump right back into it, we'll just\nminimize the command prop right here.\n\n1162\n00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,510\nWe'll go in to do\nthe connection security rules.\n\n1163\n00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,470\nWe'll create a new rule for this guy.\n\n1164\n00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:29,310\nWe'll go to custom cuz\nI like custom stuff.\n\n1165\n00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,526\nAll right.\nAnd you know what?\n\n1166\n00:57:30,526 --> 00:57:31,700\nLet's.\n>> No let's not.\n\n1167\n00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,080\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll try it.\n\n1168\n00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,450\nSo we're going to allow.\n\n1169\n00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,264\n>> Dave's feeling brave.\n\n1170\n00:57:38,264 --> 00:57:46,429\n>> So we're gonna add the, All right,\n\n1171\n00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,348\nso ask the computer where we're going to,\nso we're going to allow that guy and\n\n1172\n00:57:49,348 --> 00:57:51,531\nwe wanna add another point,\nso we'll just let anything.\n\n1173\n00:57:51,531 --> 00:57:52,225\n>> Okay.\n\n1174\n00:57:54,695 --> 00:57:55,345\n>> All right.\n\n1175\n00:57:55,345 --> 00:57:56,610\nAnd we're just gonna.\n\n1176\n00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,630\n>> We're gonna require, right?\n\n1177\n00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,110\nSo these PNG packets are really important.\n\n1178\n00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,680\nWe wanna make sure that they're\njust locked down tight.\n\n1179\n00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,260\n>> Hey, there are 53 bytes of payload\nin that ping packet available.\n\n1180\n00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,670\nI've used them before to slip\nsome things past a firewall\n\n1181\n00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:11,530\nthat wasn't allowed in certain, wait.\n\n1182\n00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,240\nIn a lab environment.\n\n1183\n00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:13,755\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1184\n00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:14,888\n>> In a lab environment, we've done that.\n\n1185\n00:58:14,888 --> 00:58:18,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Sure where to go\n\n1186\n00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:19,117\nfrom that.\n\n1187\n00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:23,406\n[CROSSTALK] And\nuser authentication via curve risk.\n\n1188\n00:58:23,406 --> 00:58:24,521\n>> Yep.\n\n1189\n00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:27,340\nWe're gonna match some policies.\n\n1190\n00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,260\n>> They've got to match, don't they?\n\n1191\n00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,940\nOh wait, so\nshould I change that back, then?\n\n1192\n00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,366\n>> No, let's not.\n[CROSSTALK] We've still got some really\n\n1193\n00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:34,034\ncool stuff.\n\n1194\n00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:36,408\nWe gotta get into wireless security,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n1195\n00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:38,020\n>> You're right, you're right.\n\n1196\n00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,190\nWe're gonna power through.\n\n1197\n00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,750\nOkay, so protocol type, right, ICMP 4.\n\n1198\n00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,420\n>> But, as Nate says,\nthe policies do have to match.\n\n1199\n00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,850\nIf one end says to authenticate the user,\nand\n\n1200\n00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,330\nthe other end says to\nauthenticate the computer.\n\n1201\n00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,320\nThen they're not going to agree,\n\n1202\n00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:56,010\nthen they're not gonna set up that\nsecurity association negotiation,\n\n1203\n00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,125\nfor some big fancy terms for\nNate because he loves when I do that.\n\n1204\n00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Those are pretty big words.\n\n1205\n00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:05,230\nAll right so here we go so\nthere is the IPsec, right.\n\n1206\n00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:08,590\nAnd so we're gonna do an outbound rules\ncuz things are going from this machine\n\n1207\n00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:13,210\ngoing to main controller and\nwe'll add a new rule we'll go\n\n1208\n00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:18,070\ncustom cuz custom's cool,\nall programs, protocol type so\n\n1209\n00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:23,410\nwe're sticking oops SMP before.\n\n1210\n00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:25,500\nAnd any any?\n\n1211\n00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,610\n>> Whatever floats your boat, man.\n\n1212\n00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:28,470\nI'm right there with

--> 00:59:42,100\nwe are going to allow\nonly if it is secure.\n\n1219\n00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,670\nAnd we'll leave right at\nthe default selection, right?\n\n1220\n00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:46,110\nIf it's authenticated.\n\n1221\n00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,180\n>> I like that.\n>> And integrity protected.\n\n1222\n00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,800\nClick it on through and-\n>> Any

01:00:14,510\nso just to cover our bases,\nwe'll apply it to all three profiles.\n\n1232\n01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:18,162\nGive it a name and a friendly description.\n\n1233\n01:00:18,162 --> 01:00:21,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n1234\n01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:23,750\nnow we've got our connection security\nrule in place on our client.\n\n1235\n01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,102\nWe've got our firewall rule\nin place on our client,\n\n1236\n01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:28,572\nwe'll pull up that command prompt again,\nI suppose.\n\n1237\n01:00:28,572 --> 01:00:32,828\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And success.\n\n1238\n01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:34,620\nLook it there.\n\n1239\n01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,910\nAll right.\n\n1240\n01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,750\nNow that he's successfully pinged\nLet's go back over to our console and\n\n1241\n01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:40,960\ntake a look at what's going on over here.\n\n1242\n01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,850\nA couple of things we\nneed to be able to do,\n\n1243\n01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:46,530\none, when we're troubleshooting like\nwe were in the middle of the break.\n\n1244\n01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:50,730\nOne of the first things we want to do\nis verify that the policy is in place.\n\n1245\n01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,320\nRight?\n\n1246\n01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,170\nBecause there's this IP sec policy agent\nservice that needs to be running, and\n\n1247\n01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:58,330\nwhen that starts up when\nyou start your computer,\n\n1248\n01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:00,900\nit loads up whatever\npolicy you've applied.\n\n1249\n01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:05,530\nUnderneath our monitoring node here in\nour Windows firewall advanced security.\n\n1250\n01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:06,400\n>> We're on the client.\n\n1251\n01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,110\nDo we need to switch over to-\n>> No, we can do it here, too.\n\n1252\n01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:08,840\n>> Oh, great.\nOkay.\n\n1253\n01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,900\n>> Yeah,\nwe would want to verify both ends, right.\n\n1254\n01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,240\nWe wanna make sure if\nsomething was going wrong,\n\n1255\n01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,870\nwe need to see why it's going wrong.\n\n1256\n01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,120\nHere on the client we can go to\nconnections and security rules,\n\n1257\n01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,650\nunder monitor.\n\n1258\n01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:24,360\n>> Yea, under monitoring, I guess not\nto derail your train of thought, right.\n\n1259\n01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,006\nMonitoring does.\n\n1260\n01:01:25,006 --> 01:01:25,697\n>> What was I saying?\n\n1261\n01:01:25,697 --> 01:01:28,716\nSorry.\n\n1262\n01:01:28,716 --> 01:01:31,512\n>> What was I saying?\n\n1263\n01:01:31,512 --> 01:01:32,477\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n1264\n01:01:32,477 --> 01:01:33,197\n>> See now I got you.\n\n1265\n01:01:33,197 --> 01:01:34,160\nSo under these monitoring.\n\n1266\n01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,839\n>> Under these monitoring, we have more\nthings other than just whether this\n\n1267\n01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:41,660\nIPsec thing is up and running.\n\n1268\n01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,780\nFirewall stuff, right?\n\n1269\n01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:48,640\nFirewall, so these are all the firewall\nrules that are currently in use.\n\n1270\n01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:55,080\nExcluding the disabled ones or\nthe ones that haven't been invoked yet.\n\n1271\n01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,700\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n1272\n01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,960\nWhen we go up to our inbound and outbound\nrules we see all the rules including\n\n1273\n01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,210\na bunch of Pre-build rules that we\njust had, don't have turned on.\n\n1274\n01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:06,800\nThe ones that are not green check\nmarks there are not turned on, and\n\n1275\n01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,520\nwhen I am troubleshooting I wanna see what\nfirewall rules are actually in place.\n\n1276\n01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,662\nSo going down that firewall\nunder monitoring that shows me\n\n1277\n01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:17,315\njust Just the rules that are being\nimplemented on this machine, and\n\n1278\n01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:21,611\nthen under connection security rules we\ncan verify that the policy is in place,\n\n1279\n01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:25,841\nand we can see what the policy is set to\nwhether it's got in point specified what\n\n1280\n01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:28,637\nauthentication method is being specified,\netc.\n\n1281\n01:02:28,637 --> 01:02:31,975\nSo when you're troubleshooting, again,\nthat's one of the first places you wanna\n\n1282\n01:02:31,975 --> 01:02:34,806\nlook is, why can this computer not\nconnect to that domain controller?\n\n1283\n01:02:34,806 --> 01:02:38,505\nWe know the domain controller's\nset up to require authentication,\n\n1284\n01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:42,040\noh, look,\nthe client hasn't loaded up the policy.\n\n1285\n01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,830\nSo, we can go restart\nthat IPsec policy driver\n\n1286\n01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,530\nto try to get that policy to kick in.\n\n1287\n01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:51,320\nThat'd be the first thing is to make\nsure you've got the appropriate policy\n\n1288\n01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,640\nin place.\n\n1289\n01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:58,810\nThen when Nate goes down to our security\nassociations, then once we've established\n\n1290\n01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:04,280\nthat IPsec conversation, we should be able\nto go here and verify that information.\n\n1291\n01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,070\nAnd if again,\nif we're troubling shooting C,\n\n1292\n01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,740\nif maybe it failed at one of these steps.\n\n1293\n01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,110\n>> So, yeah.\n\n1294\n01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:12,780\nReal quick with IPsec, right?\n\n1295\n01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:18,640\nWe won't dive into how the whole\nprotocol or thing works and what not.\n\n1296\n01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,100\nBut yeah, so, a main mode and\na quick mode, right.\n\n1297\n01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,837\nIt initially negotiates on a main mode.\n\n1298\n01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:28,970\nAnd then, it, like,\none It's like a little bit, not lesser,\n\n1299\n01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:33,170\nbut quicker encryption for\nthe quick mode, right?\n\n1300\n01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,203\n>> Yes, set in quick mode, right.\n\n1301\n01:03:34,203 --> 01:03:38,045\nWhen we talk about IPsec we've\ngot the two modes there,\n\n1302\n01:03:38,045 --> 01:03:40,838\nyou got main mode and you got quick mode.\n\n1303\n01:03:40,838 --> 01:03:43,780\nWhen your computer first tries to connect.\n\n1304\n01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:47,080\nIn this case, when we try to ping,\nthat domain controller.\n\n1305\n01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,140\nThe first thing that has to happen\nis all the authentication, right,\n\n1306\n01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,010\nbecause we've required authentication.\n\n1307\n01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:55,490\nAnd that's during, that's gonna occur\nduring that main mode association.\n\n1308\n01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,501\nWhere my computer and\n\n1309\n01:03:56,501 --> 01:04:00,491\nthe domain controller are verifying their\nidentity with each other, they're also\n\n1310\n01:04:00,491 --> 01:04:04,268\ngonna do something called the Internet\nKey Exchange at this point, or the IKE.\n\n1311\n01:04:04,268 --> 01:04:08,794\nWhere they're gonna exchange these\nkeys that they're gonna use to later\n\n1312\n01:04:08,794 --> 01:04:12,736\ngenerate the actual session keys\nthat we use to if we were gonna do\n\n1313\n01:04:12,736 --> 01:04:14,504\nthe encryption of the data.\n\n1314\n01:04:14,504 --> 01:04:18,706\nSo the main mode association is proving\nthe identity between the two ends of\n\n1315\n01:04:18,706 --> 01:04:19,848\nthe conversation.\n\n1316\n01:04:19,848 --> 01:04:23,881\nNow, once that occurs, then we can\ngo into the quick mode association.\n\n1317\n01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:26,780\nAnd, let's see,\ndo you have a main mode association?\n\n1318\n01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,380\nAll right.\n\n1319\n01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:30,150\nSo there you can see that,\nonce we ping that domain controller,\n\n1320\n01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:35,070\nit had to establish this main mode\nsecurity association, which it did.\n\n1321\n01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,320\nAnd you can see it did both the computer\nand the user, authenticated via\n\n1322\n01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:43,310\ncurve arose, and we left the default\nprotocols for the integrity reasoning.\n\n1323\n01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:46,100\nSHA1 for our hashing there.\n\n1324\n01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:50,195\n>> Mike, sorry, I don't mean to cut\nyou off, but doesn't encryption.\n\n1325\n01:04:50,195 --> 01:04:53,450\nSo, AS encryption,\ndoesn't it make you feel good knowing,\n\n1326\n01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:57,290\nthat the Ping packets as\nthey traverse the network?\n\n1327\n01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:00,070\n>> Yes, and\nwe're authenticating the authentication,\n\n1328\n01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,370\nwe're encrypting\nthe authentication process, right?\n\n1329\n01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,160\n>> Yeah?\n>> Yeah, that computer's name and\n\n1330\n01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:10,944\ninformation so, that's using AES,\nwhich is advanced encryption service.\n\n1331\n01:05:10,944 --> 01:05:14,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The new default encryption for\n\n1332\n01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,280\ngovernment.\n\n1333\n01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:19,030\n>> Anyway, so\nthat's our main mode association.\n\n1334\n01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,310\nThat happens first.\n\n1335\n01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:26,310\nThen we have our Quick Mode association\nunderneath that, if you want to go there.\n\n1336\n01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:26,910\n>> Quick Mode?\n\n1337\n01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:29,589\n[CROSSTALK] Click on it, let's see.\n\n1338\n01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:31,510\n>> Let's show them what\nthat Quick Mode is.\n\n1339\n01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:38,290\nAnd there's my Quick Mode association, so\nonce we have established that main mode.\n\n1340\n01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,470\nAnd we can use that key\nthat we established during\n\n1341\n01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:46,050\nthe main mode association to generate\na session key for the Quick Mode.\n\n1342\n01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:52,790\nGo ahead and refresh,\nright, click on Quick Mode,\n\n1343\n01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:57,380\nand do a little refresh there.\n\n1344\n01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,120\nIt's gone.\n\n1345\n01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:58,980\nAll right.\n\n1346\n01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,210\n>> Yeah,\nwe've got a interesting little thing.\n\n1347\n01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:06,510\nA chat we got coming in\nfrom a viewer out there.\n\n1348\n01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:10,532\nThat quick mode is like Nestle Qick,\nas opposed to main mode.\n\n1349\n01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:12,995\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> We've got some really\n\n1350\n01:06:12,995 --> 01:06:13,956\nbrilliant viewers.\n\n1351\n01:06:13,956 --> 01:06:16,440\n>> And some clowns there.\n\n1352\n01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:22,140\nBut Quick Mode is not like\na chocolate milk with Nestle Quick,\n\n1353\n01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,800\nQuick Mode so it is quicker.\n\n1354\n01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,430\n>> It is quicker.\n\n1355\n01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:29,680\nSo what's going on here is when they\nfirst set up the communication,\n\n1356\n01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,630\nwe're gonna do a main mode association.\n\n1357\n01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:34,550\nWhere again we do our\nidentification of either end and\n\n1358\n01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,810\nwe do our internet key exchange or IKE.\n\n1359\n01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:39,480\n>> Once we've done that,\nthen we do a Quick Mode association,\n\n1360\n01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,530\nwhere we generate another\nkey that's gonna be used to,\n\n1361\n01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:47,720\nif we had done an encryption,\nwe could use that to encrypt the traffic.\n\n1362\n01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:52,910\nNow as we see here, the Quick Mode has\ngone away, the main mode is still there.\n\n1363\n01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:55,370\nThe main mode has a longer lifetime,\n\n1364\n01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,252\nonce I've established a main mode\nassociation with another machine,\n\n1365\n01:06:58,252 --> 01:07:01,600\nI wanna say it's about eight hours,\nbut don't quote me on that.\n\n1366\n01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,880\nI'd have to go look that up.\n\n1367\n01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,060\nThat's gonna remain.\n\n1368\n01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:08,630\nThe quick mode is brought up just for\nwhen you start to send data back and\n\n1369\n01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:11,120\nforth, very short lifetime.\n\n1370\n01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,230\nOnce the data has stopped\nbeing transmitted,\n\n1371\n01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,740\nthe Quick Mode starts to time out.\n\n1372\n01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,280\nWithin a few minutes\nthe Quick Mode goes away.\n\n1373\n01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:22,740\nThen when you go to Ping again, or\nsend more data, I don't have to go\n\n1374\n01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:25,230\nthrough the whole main mode association\nagain, I've already done that.\n\n1375\n01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:27,980\nSo all I have to do,\nis the Quick Mode association, and\n\n1376\n01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,600\nwe can start communicating again.\n\n1377\n01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,180\nHence the name Quick Mode.\n\n1378\n01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:33,770\nSo, you can establish\nmain mode associations.\n\n1379\n01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:36,550\nThose are gonna last\nusually a business day.\n\n1380\n01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:39,800\nThen, any time I need to\ntalk to that server again,\n\n1381\n01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,980\nall I have to do is a Quick Mode.\n\n1382\n01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,420\nWe've already authenticated each other.\n\n1383\n01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,910\nWe've already verified our identities.\n\n1384\n01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:45,820\nWe don't have to go through that again.\n\n1385\n01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,900\nWe can just establish a Quick Mode, send\ndata back and forth, Quick Mode goes away.\n\n1386\n01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,320\nConnect to it again,\nestablish another Quick Mode.\n\n1387\n01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,100\nQuick Mode goes away.\n\n1388\n01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:54,865\n>> So.\n\n1389\n01:07:54,865 --> 01:07:59,340\nThat's the main mode and the Quick Modes.\n\n1390\n01:07:59,340 --> 01:07:59,870\n>> All right.\n>> [COUGH]\n\n1391\n01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:00,370\n>> Well thank you.\n\n1392\n01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:01,206\nAll right, so yeah.\n\n1393\n01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:03,595\nWe're gonna take it get\na little stuff runner.\n\n1394\n01:08:03,595 --> 01:08:08,525\nSo, we have the right so\nour connections set up.\n\n1395\n01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:11,729\nLet's set up with a exclusion.\n\n1396\n01:08:11,729 --> 01:08:15,287\n>> And exclusion.\n\n1397\n01:08:15,287 --> 01:08:15,957\n>> So to do that,\n\n1398\n01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:22,197\nwe will modify, we'll modify the heavy\nset connection security rule.\n\n1399\n01:08:22,197 --> 01:08:22,917\nSo we'll go in here.\n\n1400\n01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:27,127\nActually I'm sorry, we're not.\n\n1401\n01:08:27,127 --> 01:08:27,932\nWe're just creating an all new.\n\n1402\n01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:29,783\n>> Rule, a new one.\n\n1403\n01:08:29,783 --> 01:08:34,878\n>> An authentication exemption,\nI'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n1404\n01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:39,253\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're going to modify this one, and\n\n1405\n01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:40,867\nwe're still going to require it.\n\n1406\n01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:41,441\n>> Okay.\n\n1407\n01:08:41,441 --> 01:08:46,650\n>> But this time,\nwe're going to do a pre-shared fee.\n\n1408\n01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,000\n>> A pre-shared fee, all right.\n\n1409\n01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,650\n>> ASDF, all right?\n\n1410\n01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:54,755\nSo now, and\nthen to match it on the client side.\n\n1411\n01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,735\n>> So we're changing our authentication\nrequirements from computer, and\n\n1412\n01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:00,862\nuser via Kerberos to pre-shared key.\n\n1413\n01:09:04,534 --> 01:09:07,280\nAnd we'll have to make that\nmatch on the other end as well.\n\n1414\n01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:10,130\nOtherwise they will not\nbe able to communicate..\n\n1415\n01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:15,035\nAnd as he said in this episode,\nwe're gonna raise up an authentication\n\n1416\n01:09:15,035 --> 01:09:19,697\nin exemption, because I might\nwanna require authentication, but\n\n1417\n01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:23,170\nsome devices might not support IP set.\n\n1418\n01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:25,940\nOr I might have some computers\nthat I wanna be able to connect\n\n1419\n01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,230\neven without the authentications.\n\n1420\n01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:30,190\nSo, we can set up setup exceptions\nto the rule to allow that traffic.\n\n1421\n01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,250\n>> So, we changed our authentication type.\n\n1422\n01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,230\nSo there's our stuff back up there.\n\n1423\n01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,180\nAll right.\nSo, it's working fine.\n\n1424\n01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:42,380\nSo now let's, we're gonna break it.\n\n1425\n01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,670\nWe're gonna make it so\nit doesn't work anymore.\n\n1426\n01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:48,155\nAnd we'll go back into properties,\nand on the pre-shared key.\n\n1427\n01:09:54,926 --> 01:09:56,883\nI put a little a in there, so now.\n\n1428\n01:09:56,883 --> 01:10:00,139\n>> So now,\nhe doesn't have the right pre-shared key.\n\n1429\n01:10:05,981 --> 01:10:11,582\nAnd no longer can we\nestablish our IP sec channel.\n\n1430\n01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:19,190\n>> So Phil,\nwe'll add an exclusion in there.\n\n1431\n01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,720\nAnd it might be a little odd\nway to implement these things.\n\n1432\n01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,780\n>> Yeah, it might not be\nsomething we would do normally.\n\n1433\n01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:30,070\nBut as a demo, to show to show you guys\nwhat this exception allows me to do,\n\n1434\n01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:35,080\nwe first broke it, so the client can no\nlonger talk to the domain controller,\n\n1435\n01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,190\nbecause he doesn't have\nthe right pre-shared key.\n\n1436\n01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:41,580\nThen we can set up an authentication\nexception, so even though he has the wrong\n\n1437\n01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:46,387\npre-shared key, we're exempting him from\nthe requirement to authenticate a key.\n\n1438\n01:10:46,387 --> 01:10:50,952\nAll right, so\nwe're going to add this computer, and\n\n1439\n01:10:50,952 --> 01:10:56,646\nI peaked at its IP address earlier,\n12.168.10.10.\n\n1440\n01:10:56,646 --> 01:10:58,160\nSo, we're gonna add this machine.\n\n1441\n01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:03,579\nWe'll click on through,\nlet it apply to all the profiles.\n\n1442\n01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:12,840\nWe'll call this IP Sec Ping\nallow if you are on this.\n\n1443\n01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,730\n>> Great googly moogly.\n\n1444\n01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:14,312\n>> I know, Mike.\n\n1445\n01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then we'll go back\n\n1446\n01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,410\ninto the properties of\nthe rule we had just created.\n\n1447\n01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:22,820\nAnd we'll go to ports, instead of any,\n\n1448\n01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,880\nwe'll change it to to the pink packets\nwhich is what we're playing with today.\n\n1449\n01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,890\nSo there you go, so\nthere is the exemption.\n\n1450\n01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:29,390\n>> Okay.\n\n1451\n01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,793\n>> We'll jump back over to the client.\n\n1452\n01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:36,689\n>> Search right.\n>> Drum roll.\n\n1453\n01:11:36,689 --> 01:11:41,852\nNo search luck!\n\n1454\n01:11:41,852 --> 01:11:44,840\n>> Search luck.\n\n1455\n01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:49,930\n>> All right,\nwell let's go see what's going on here.\n\n1456\n01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,300\n>> All right.\n\n1457\n01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:53,710\n>> If we're gonna troubleshoot these guys,\n\n1458\n01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:57,950\nthe first thing we wanna do is make\nsure our policies were in place.\n\n1459\n01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:59,760\nI've lost track of what we've got.\n\n1460\n01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,890\nWe've got our IP Sec rule.\n\n1461\n01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:04,940\nThat requires authentication inbound and\noutbound.\n\n1462\n01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:08,210\nAnd then you added a separate rule for\nthe authentication, or\n\n1463\n01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:10,420\nyou modified the existing rule.\n\n1464\n01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:14,419\n>> I created a new rule for the exemption.\n\n1465\n01:12:14,419 --> 01:12:21,012\n>> Now, how many IP Sec policies can\na computer have in place at one time?\n\n1466\n01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:23,216\n>> Maybe one.\n\n1467\n01:12:23,216 --> 01:12:25,736\nSo maybe it still has\nthe association from the last one?\n\n1468\n01:12:25,736 --> 01:12:28,461\n>> Yeah.\nWe would really need to modify that\n\n1469\n01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:33,456\nexisting rule or get rid of that existing\nrule cuz you can only load up one\n\n1470\n01:12:33,456 --> 01:12:35,550\nparticular policy at a time.\n\n1471\n01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,700\nSo let's go in and see.\n\n1472\n01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,190\nSo now we have no more\nassociations going on.\n\n1473\n01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:48,050\nWe've got one rule sitting there.\n\n1474\n01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:49,420\nAnd that's on the client.\n\n1475\n01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:49,970\n>> Correct.\n>> So\n\n1476\n01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:56,260\nthen on the domain controller, we verify\nthat we've got our rule in place there.\n\n1477\n01:12:56,260 --> 01:13:00,701\nAnd can we add the exemption\nto the insisting rule or\n\n1478\n01:13:00,701 --> 01:13:03,085\nget rid of your other rule?\n\n1479\n01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:04,625\nWe'll just disable it.\n\n1480\n01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:07,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n1481\n01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,630\nBut I don't think you set\nthat rule up the same.\n\n1482\n01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:10,530\n>> Oh, this one?\n\n1483\n01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:11,420\nYeah.\nTry it and see.\n\n1484\n01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,050\n>> I don't think that one was\nrequiring authentication, was it?\n\n1485\n01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,500\nYep, no love there.\n\n1486\n01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,646\nLet's see.\nSo what we could do, rather than, and\n\n1487\n01:13:29,646 --> 01:13:34,341\nprobably the easiest thing to do for the\ndemo purposes so we don't spend all day\n\n1488\n01:13:34,341 --> 01:13:38,630\ntroubleshooting these guys,\nis to just re-do our policy real quick.\n\n1489\n01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,470\nThat'd probably be\nthe easiest thing to do.\n\n1490\n01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:45,740\nSo let's just go back through there, go\ninto your properties, and what do we got?\n\n1491\n01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,160\nWe're on our domain control.\n\n1492\n01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,630\n>> We're on the, this is the client.\n\n1493\n01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:49,750\n>> Okay.\n\n1494\n01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:56,330\nSo on the client we don't need to\nadd any exceptions on the- Yeah.\n\n1495\n01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:59,830\nSo this rule will kick in\nwhen it goes to this IP,\n\n1496\n01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:04,450\nwhich is the computer on, right?\n\n1497\n01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:08,500\nTheme packet thing and\nrequire it with the pre-shared key,\n\n1498\n01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,320\nwhich we purposely mistyped.\n\n1499\n01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:16,090\n>> So that looks good there, and\nthen it applies to everything.\n\n1500\n01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,382\nAnd then I would check down\nunderneath your monitoring note and\n\n1501\n01:14:19,382 --> 01:14:21,380\nmake sure that that rule was in place.\n\n1502\n01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:22,120\nYep.\n\n1503\n01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,540\nBeautiful.\n\n1504\n01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:27,295\nThen we flip back over to Mr.\nDomain Controller and see what he's got.\n\n1505\n01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:30,914\n[COUGH] And let's see what rule he\nhas in place at this point, and\n\n1506\n01:14:30,914 --> 01:14:35,370\nagain, go to your monitoring,\nand let's make sure that he has.\n\n1507\n01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,140\nAnd he does have both rules fired up.\n\n1508\n01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:37,960\nInteresting.\nOkay.\n\n1509\n01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,912\nYeah.\nI don't know where you wanna start with\n\n1510\n01:14:44,912 --> 01:14:45,920\nthat one, if we want to.\n\n1511\n01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,670\n>> Let me verify this guy's IP for\nthe fun of it.\n\n1512\n01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:49,170\n>> Okay.\n\n1513\n01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,090\nThe joys of IPsec.\n\n1514\n01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,652\n[LAUGH] One of the first things\nwe’ll learn with IPsec, one,\n\n1515\n01:14:57,652 --> 01:14:59,730\ntroubleshooting can be challenging.\n\n1516\n01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:02,480\nTypically when we’re troubleshooting one\nof the first things you’re gonna do with\n\n1517\n01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,380\nIPsec is turn off all your IPsec policies.\n\n1518\n01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:07,362\nVerify that you have\nelectrical connectivity,\n\n1519\n01:15:07,362 --> 01:15:08,870\nthat you can ping one into the other.\n\n1520\n01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:12,670\nNow we already know that so,\nwe don’t have to go to that step.\n\n1521\n01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:15,692\nSo we’ll take a look at\nour policies here and\n\n1522\n01:15:15,692 --> 01:15:19,210\nsee if we can find something\nthat’s not matching.\n\n1523\n01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:22,420\nSo if you wanna pull that guy up and\ngo through them.\n\n1524\n01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,350\n>> Oh wait.\n\n1525\n01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:25,750\nThat's [INAUDIBLE] monitoring.\n\n1526\n01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:33,930\nAnd I did not see your IP address,\nis that correct?\n\n1527\n01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:35,270\n>> Yes.\nIf we want.\n\n1528\n01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,550\nChange that back to just any [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1529\n01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:38,800\nLet's just go with that.\n\n1530\n01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:43,630\nIt is CMP before, correct.\n\n1531\n01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:47,630\nAnd do not authenticate's\ncuz it's an exemption rule.\n\n1532\n01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,086\nAnd it applies to all three profiles.\n\n1533\n01:15:51,086 --> 01:15:54,690\nAll right, looks good.\n\n1534\n01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:55,942\nTry it again.\n>> Let's try it one more time and\n\n1535\n01:15:55,942 --> 01:15:56,510\nsee what happens.\n\n1536\n01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:03,880\nAnd we got a lot of nothing there.\n\n1537\n01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,288\nSo then the next thing I would wanna do is\ngo back over to my domain controller and\n\n1538\n01:16:07,288 --> 01:16:10,660\ndisable that rule we just created,\nsince it seems to be causing the problem.\n\n1539\n01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:14,790\nLet's disable it and verify that we\ncan get back to a working state.\n\n1540\n01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,190\nAnd then we can troubleshoot\nour rule there.\n\n1541\n01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,900\n>> All right.\n\n1542\n01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:18,630\nSo, okay.\n\n1543\n01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:21,210\nIn that case then, let.\n\n1544\n01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,180\n>> You have to change your\npassword back and everything.\n\n1545\n01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:26,200\nGood thing it's quick and easy.\n\n1546\n01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n1547\n01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,212\n>> What was that password?\n\n1548\n01:16:28,212 --> 01:16:29,252\n[LAUGH]\n\n1549\n01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,680\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1550\n01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,260\nDefinitely up and working.\n\n1551\n01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,510\nSo we're good.\n\n1552\n01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:46,689\nSo the exclusions, so\n\n1553\n01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:50,880\nthey're starting out with the exclusion\nthen that's not being filtered out.\n\n1554\n01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,090\n>> So\nlet's say we've got our rules set up.\n\n1555\n01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:54,450\nWe are now communicating.\n\n1556\n01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:58,918\nLet's check our quick mode, make sure\nwe got an association going on there.\n\n1557\n01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:00,680\nAll right, so\neverything seems to be working fine.\n\n1558\n01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,699\nThen we're gonna break\nit by going back in and\n\n1559\n01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:08,630\nlet's change that password,\nI guess on your connection security rule.\n\n1560\n01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:25,340\nAll right, so now when we try to ping.\n\n1561\n01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:31,775\nBecause we have the wrong pre-shared key,\nwe're unable to establish that IP set\n\n1562\n01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,420\nconversation, or\nthat security association.\n\n1563\n01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:36,745\nSo then we're gonna go back over\nto our domain controller and\n\n1564\n01:17:36,745 --> 01:17:38,600\nsee if we can set up an exemption.\n\n1565\n01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,840\nSo what I would do,\n\n1566\n01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,360\nis I would go back to the rule that we've\ngot in place that's already working.\n\n1567\n01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:47,420\nAnd let's edit that rule.\n\n1568\n01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,170\nOops.\n\n1569\n01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,300\nAnd let's add an exemption here.\n\n1570\n01:18:01,544 --> 01:18:09,120\nOn your authentication tab,\ngo down into your customize.\n\n1571\n01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,637\n>> Oh and\nI can't add the exemption there, can I?\n\n1572\n01:18:11,637 --> 01:18:14,540\n>> We're gonna have to use the other rule.\n\n1573\n01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,050\nSo go ahead and hit OK on that one.\n\n1574\n01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:21,720\nAnd then let's troubleshoot, let's go\nthrough that rule that you have in place\n\n1575\n01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,630\nup there that's supposed\nto be our exemption.\n\n1576\n01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:25,050\nSo let's see what we've got in there.\n\n1577\n01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,330\nWe've got from any to any.\n\n1578\n01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,890\nProtocols enforced,\nI've seen these before.\n\n1579\n01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:36,860\nWe are not going to be authenticating.\n\n1580\n01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:44,230\nAll right.\n>> Let me add this guy up\n\n1581\n01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:45,540\nto import number one.\n\n1582\n01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,340\nOkay.\n\n1583\n01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:51,090\nJust for the one and two.168.\n\n1584\n01:18:53,753 --> 01:18:54,383\n10.10.\n\n1585\n01:18:54,383 --> 01:19:00,629\nSo now anything from this\naddress should be good.\n\n1586\n01:19:09,255 --> 01:19:10,175\nStill no luck.\n\n1587\n01:19:14,008 --> 01:19:17,211\nInteresting.\n\n1588\n01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:21,050\n>> Well all right, we'll\n>> Troubleshoot this guy.\n\n1589\n01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:23,650\n>> We'll take a look, something's\nhung up in the background there.\n\n1590\n01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:24,470\nSwitching back and forth.\n\n1591\n01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:28,270\nSometimes switching back and forth between\npolicies like that, we might have to\n\n1592\n01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:32,830\nrestart that IPsec policy driver to make\nsure it has the right policy loaded up.\n\n1593\n01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:35,620\nChanging a policy, kinda like,\nwell we haven't gone through,\n\n1594\n01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,550\nI don't know if we've done any episodes on\ngroup policy, but to make changes to those\n\n1595\n01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,800\npolicies we do wanna make sure that\nthose changes are being applied.\n\n1596\n01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,020\nAnd so we can go through and take a look\nat that real quick while we're on break.\n\n1597\n01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,590\nWe come back and we'll show them again.\n\n1598\n01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:48,700\n>> Yep.\nTake a look at it,\n\n1599\n01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,460\nwe've got yep, two more things to look at.\n\n1600\n01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:54,610\nNow we're discovering And\nwireless networks.\n\n1601\n01:19:54,610 --> 01:19:56,810\n>> Wireless security,\nthat's lot of stuff there.\n\n1602\n01:19:56,810 --> 01:20:00,557\n>> We'll hit on that stuff after the\nbreak, and we'll iron this stuff out, and\n\n1603\n01:20:00,557 --> 01:20:02,010\nget that exemption rolling.\n\n1604\n01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,090\n>> Yep, sounds like a plan.\n\n1605\n01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,670\n>> See you back after the break.\n\n1606\n01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:13,330\n[SOUND]\nI don't know.\n\n1607\n01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,850\n>> Well welcome back.\n\n1608\n01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:19,472\nAll right, so where we left off,\nwe're kind of up in the air\n\n1609\n01:20:19,472 --> 01:20:22,215\n[CROSSTALK] We did fix it and\n>> We did.\n\n1610\n01:20:22,215 --> 01:20:26,177\n>> And it was a change that I\nmade on the client beforehand.\n\n1611\n01:20:26,177 --> 01:20:27,592\nAnd a-\n>> Oops.\n\n1612\n01:20:27,592 --> 01:20:28,238\n>> Yep, oops.\n\n1613\n01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:29,728\n>> Had a little oops moment.\n\n1614\n01:20:29,728 --> 01:20:31,160\nWe left it at what?\n\n1615\n01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,310\nRequires security?\n\n1616\n01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:35,240\n>> Yep you know what?\n\n1617\n01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,640\nYeah, we can go look at the rules right\nquick just to so everything is all.\n\n1618\n01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:44,960\nAll kind of, yep, lined out and\nso just right where we're at.\n\n1619\n01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,750\nWhat?\n\n1620\n01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:49,405\n>> Yeah, we had set up an exception\non the domain controller side and\n\n1621\n01:20:49,405 --> 01:20:53,925\nthat policy we set up an exemption to not\nauthenticate that particular IP address\n\n1622\n01:20:53,925 --> 01:20:55,340\nfrom the client.\n\n1623\n01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:58,120\nThe client on the other hand was\nstill set to require security.\n\n1624\n01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:01,650\nSo even though the domain controller's\ngonna allow him to come in\n\n1625\n01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:05,170\nwithout authenticating, he was saying,\nno no no, we've got to authenticate.\n\n1626\n01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,484\nAnd so\nthat wasn't gonna work in there itself.\n\n1627\n01:21:06,484 --> 01:21:08,103\n>> Yep.\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n1628\n01:21:08,103 --> 01:21:09,102\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n1629\n01:21:09,102 --> 01:21:14,694\nOn the client, right, so we changed\nthis guy's rule to request inbound\n\n1630\n01:21:14,694 --> 01:21:20,120\ninstead of require, to allow it to\nwork without the authentication.\n\n1631\n01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:25,220\nWe can bring this up and we're testing it,\nand sure enough the traffic goes through.\n\n1632\n01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:31,090\nAnd then on the main controller,\nall right, so it's rules, right there,\n\n1633\n01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:37,380\nthe IPsec rule that he has is\nrequire inbound and outbound, right?\n\n1634\n01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,207\nSo we set up that client rule\nto match this one, right?\n\n1635\n01:21:41,207 --> 01:21:43,640\nIt was requiring and then the exception.\n\n1636\n01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:47,906\nDo not authenticate anything\nfrom 102.168.10.10.\n\n1637\n01:21:47,906 --> 01:21:52,312\nThe [INAUDIBLE] was allowing\nit to come in unauthenticated.\n\n1638\n01:21:52,312 --> 01:21:54,850\nThe client wasn't gonna do it.\n\n1639\n01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:55,550\nYou required it.\n\n1640\n01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,240\nIt broke.\n\n1641\n01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,320\nWe changed it and it works.\n\n1642\n01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,220\n>> That's fixed?\n\n1643\n01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,540\nWell, good troubleshooting.\n\n1644\n01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,740\nGot to see some of the things we would\ngo through in the real world if we were\n\n1645\n01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:05,040\nhaving issues like IPsec policies.\n\n1646\n01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,900\nTurn them off.\n\n1647\n01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,762\nVerify that you can ping one another.\n\n1648\n01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,555\nMake sure you got\nelectrical connectivity and\n\n1649\n01:22:09,555 --> 01:22:12,255\nthen start going through the policies and\nmake sure they match.\n\n1650\n01:22:12,255 --> 01:22:16,324\nAnd we did that found that and\nnow everything's working like a charm.\n\n1651\n01:22:16,324 --> 01:22:20,713\n>> We're like a charm, so all right,\nthe next little sub objective,\n\n1652\n01:22:20,713 --> 01:22:22,488\nit's network discovery.\n\n1653\n01:22:22,488 --> 01:22:23,556\n>> Discovery.\n\n1654\n01:22:23,556 --> 01:22:27,181\n>> Now were discovery,\npretty neat, pretty thing,\n\n1655\n01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:31,752\ni don't think it would be much\nwith business in the enterprise.\n\n1656\n01:22:31,752 --> 01:22:37,168\nIt seems to be more of a home\nper small office kind of thing.\n\n1657\n01:22:37,168 --> 01:22:42,355\nAn easy way to, for computers to\nadvertise what they're sharing,\n\n1658\n01:22:42,355 --> 01:22:47,276\nto participate in their little things,\nand share their stuff.\n\n1659\n01:22:47,276 --> 01:22:49,060\n>> Yeah, Absolutely.\n\n1660\n01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:52,637\nYeah, well, with network discovery, even\nin the corporate environment if I disable\n\n1661\n01:22:52,637 --> 01:22:55,087\nnetwork discovery,\nthen I can no longer see the network and\n\n1662\n01:22:55,087 --> 01:22:57,510\nI can't see any of those\nshares that are out there.\n\n1663\n01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,430\nAnd they can no longer see me, right?\n\n1664\n01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:02,160\nSo if we just say yeah,\nif we turn off network discovery so it is,\n\n1665\n01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,080\nwe are gonna use that there as well.\n\n1666\n01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,440\n>> Well, sweet.\n\n1667\n01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,290\nWell all right.\n\n1668\n01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:07,590\nNetwork discovery.\n>> It's really just a matter of\n\n1669\n01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:08,740\nturning on, turning off, right?\n\n1670\n01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:09,240\n>> Yeah.\n\n1671\n01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,950\nWell should we take a look at it?\n\n1672\n01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,163\n>> Let's do it.\n>> All right, so.\n\n1673\n01:23:13,163 --> 01:23:14,696\n>> I don't want to leave them hanging.\n\n1674\n01:23:14,696 --> 01:23:17,590\n>> So network or the network discovery.\n\n1675\n01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:20,620\nAll right,\nthat's not in the firewall, is it?\n\n1676\n01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,860\nSo we'll close that guy out.\n\n1677\n01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:26,540\nAll right, Mike, so we'll go into\nour Network and Sharing Center.\n\n1678\n01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:31,490\nAnd change Advanced-\n>> Advanced sharing settings.\n\n1679\n01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:34,350\n>> And oh yeah, so,\nyeah what we talked about earlier.\n\n1680\n01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:37,478\nThe well, let's keep moving forward here.\n\n1681\n01:23:37,478 --> 01:23:41,450\n>> Alright so and we've got our\ncurrent profile as our domain profile.\n\n1682\n01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:44,070\nWe could configure this\nindividually on each profile.\n\n1683\n01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:45,160\nI might now want to give.\n\n1684\n01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,930\nTake a look at our descriptions there,\nwith network discovery, when network\n\n1685\n01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:51,899\ndiscovery is on, the computer can see\nother network computers and devices.\n\n1686\n01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,270\nAnd it's visible to\nother network computers.\n\n1687\n01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:58,990\nSo on my domain profile,\nI want to be able to connect.\n\n1688\n01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:01,170\nI want to see those shares that\narea available on my network.\n\n1689\n01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,030\nI want to see all the servers,\nthe file servers.\n\n1690\n01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:06,540\nMaybe my coworker has\nmade a share available.\n\n1691\n01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:10,260\nSo I need to enable that network\ndiscovery so that I can find those guys.\n\n1692\n01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,950\nAnd if I've shared something out,\nI want to make sure that they can find me,\n\n1693\n01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:16,910\nso we just enable that network discovery.\n\n1694\n01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:20,930\nOn a public network however, I might\n\n1695\n01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:25,690\nnot want people to see those shares that I\nhave created because I'm out of Starbucks,\n\n1696\n01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:30,672\nI'm not at work, so I would wanna turn\noff network discovery [LAUGH] and\n\n1697\n01:24:30,672 --> 01:24:33,620\nprobably not share it on that\npublic network profile, right?\n\n1698\n01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:36,000\nBut yeah, so we do wanna enable that.\n\n1699\n01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,500\nAnd that's also when you connect\nto a network for the first time.\n\n1700\n01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,600\nWhen it's asking you,\nwhen you connect to that network and\n\n1701\n01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,750\nit says, do you wanna enable\nsharing on this network or not?\n\n1702\n01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:48,440\nThis is what you're choosing, right?\n\n1703\n01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:51,680\nThis is where, and you could always\ngo back in and change it here\n\n1704\n01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,820\nif you chose inappropriately when\nyou first connected that network.\n\n1705\n01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,315\n>> So, Mike.\nLet me ask you this.\n\n1706\n01:24:56,315 --> 01:25:00,039\nSo let's say, right,\nyou have two computers, and\n\n1707\n01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:03,097\nboth of them are sharing folders, right?\n\n1708\n01:25:03,097 --> 01:25:07,485\nAnd I think I've got it set up on here.\n\n1709\n01:25:07,485 --> 01:25:09,140\nSo network discovery, right?\n\n1710\n01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,770\nWe click on our network.\n\n1711\n01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:11,840\nSo there we go.\n\n1712\n01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,571\nWe can see that the DC01, our little\ndomain controller over there we've been\n\n1713\n01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:18,767\nmessing with, there he is, right?\n\n1714\n01:25:18,767 --> 01:25:22,420\nWe can click on him, and\nthere's the stuff that he shares.\n\n1715\n01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,730\n>> Yup,\nany shares that he has made available.\n\n1716\n01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:26,899\n>> Courtesy of network discovery, right?\n\n1717\n01:25:26,899 --> 01:25:27,400\n>> Yep.\n\n1718\n01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:31,160\n>> If we turn discovery network off,\nright?\n\n1719\n01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:34,320\nThe main controller is\nstill sharing that stuff.\n\n1720\n01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,310\nCould we then browse by computer,\n\n1721\n01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:40,910\ncould we still connect to him\nby his name or IP address?\n\n1722\n01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:42,150\n>> Let's try it and see.\n\n1723\n01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:44,200\nI'm gonna say no.\n\n1724\n01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:44,890\n>> Oh yeah?\n>> So yeah.\n\n1725\n01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:45,790\nGo ahead and turn off.\n\n1726\n01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:46,500\nGo back over to your.\n\n1727\n01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,010\nWhat are you on now?\n\n1728\n01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:48,270\nYour on the client?\n\n1729\n01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:51,280\n>> Correct.\n>> So let's disable on our domain profile,\n\n1730\n01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,770\ncuz that is our current profile.\n\n1731\n01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,140\nTurn off network discovery.\n\n1732\n01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,060\n>> And we're still leave file and\nprinter sharing, right?\n\n1733\n01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:00,272\n>> Yeah.\nThat's just whether or\n\n1734\n01:26:00,272 --> 01:26:01,480\nnot they can see your shares.\n\n1735\n01:26:05,007 --> 01:26:12,102\nSo, yeah, let's go back over there, we've\nchanged that, and refresh, and he's gone.\n\n1736\n01:26:12,102 --> 01:26:12,798\n>> Okay.\n\n1737\n01:26:12,798 --> 01:26:14,569\n>> All right, so\nnow if we go up to our address bar.\n\n1738\n01:26:21,104 --> 01:26:23,460\n>> [CROSSTALK] Nice, so prove me wrong.\n\n1739\n01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:27,061\nAll right, Because the domain\ncontroller still has file and\n\n1740\n01:26:27,061 --> 01:26:29,186\nprinter sharing enabled, right?\n\n1741\n01:26:29,186 --> 01:26:30,004\n>> So there we go.\n\n1742\n01:26:30,004 --> 01:26:32,755\nSo, sorry Mike, I.\n\n1743\n01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:34,020\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh no, that's all right.\n\n1744\n01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:34,995\nThat's quite all right.\n\n1745\n01:26:34,995 --> 01:26:39,480\n[LAUGH]\n>> I didn't wanna feel kind of like.\n\n1746\n01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,090\nAnyhow.\n\n1747\n01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:40,660\nSo yeah.\n\n1748\n01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:43,720\nNetwork discover right,\neasy, quick way now.\n\n1749\n01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:48,305\nThis way, if we were to browse to\nour network stuff, nothing's listed.\n\n1750\n01:26:48,305 --> 01:26:50,610\n>> Right.\n>> We can't see anything.\n\n1751\n01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:55,630\nIt's not easy, quicky stuff, we'd have\nto know the names or IPs of whatever\n\n1752\n01:26:55,630 --> 01:27:01,480\nwe're wanting to connect to or have them\npre-mapped and make it a little easier.\n\n1753\n01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,800\n>> By turning that off we've disabled,\nbasically,\n\n1754\n01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,840\nthe link layer topology\ndiscovery protocol, right?\n\n1755\n01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,960\nSo it can no longer just automatically\nfind all those things and\n\n1756\n01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,300\nif you know the name of it,\nand it's shared out, and\n\n1757\n01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:17,200\nyou have permission to access that share,\nyou can still navigate directly to it,\n\n1758\n01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,390\nit just doesn't show up on\nthe browse lists anymore.\n\n1759\n01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:23,870\n>> And the link layer network.\n\n1760\n01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:24,850\nWhat thing that you just mentioned?\n\n1761\n01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:26,600\n>> Link layer topology discovery?\n\n1762\n01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:31,743\n>> Yep, good thing you brought that up,\ncause there is an option I,\n\n1763\n01:27:31,743 --> 01:27:36,660\njust to point out,\nthat we can configure it right for.\n\n1764\n01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:39,420\nYeah, this is in the local\ngroup security policy.\n\n1765\n01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,467\nSo for anyone who logs into the computer,\n\n1766\n01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:51,801\nAnd let's see.\n\n1767\n01:27:56,921 --> 01:27:59,191\nThere we go,\nlink layer topology discovery.\n\n1768\n01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:02,430\nSo there's that guy.\n\n1769\n01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:05,100\nWe can turn this on, or off, right?\n\n1770\n01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:06,884\nSo turn on that.\n\n1771\n01:28:06,884 --> 01:28:10,954\nWe're going to disable this,\nso now it doesn't work, and so\n\n1772\n01:28:10,954 --> 01:28:15,731\nnow anyone who would log onto the\ncomputer, even though they would try to\n\n1773\n01:28:15,731 --> 01:28:20,066\nenable Network Discovery,\nwe can control how or who gets to use.\n\n1774\n01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:21,641\nTo use it?\n\n1775\n01:28:21,641 --> 01:28:24,627\n>> Because there will be a policy and\nthey can't turn it back on.\n\n1776\n01:28:24,627 --> 01:28:25,970\nVery good.\n\n1777\n01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:28,610\nAll right, now we're discovery,\nright, that was it.\n\n1778\n01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:29,130\n>> That was it.\n\n1779\n01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:32,220\nNot a lot too it, whether or\nnot you can browse the network and\n\n1780\n01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:35,250\nsee all those shares that are out there,\nand again whether they can see you.\n\n1781\n01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:40,230\nAnd the main thing that we want to know\nabout that is on our public profiles,\n\n1782\n01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:41,410\nwe probably want to disable that.\n\n1783\n01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:46,050\nBecause we don't want to be sitting at\nStarbucks and have somebody just open up\n\n1784\n01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:50,680\nand browse the network, and\nsee all of those shares on my machine, and\n\n1785\n01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,630\nthen try to attempt to connect to them,\nso, turn that off.\n\n1786\n01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:54,630\nIn a corporate environment or\n\n1787\n01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,790\non your home network,\nwell you probably want to enable that.\n\n1788\n01:28:56,790 --> 01:29:00,320\nTo make it easy to connect to those shares\nand not have to know the exact name and\n\n1789\n01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,270\ntype in that UNC path.\n\n1790\n01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:03,902\nI like it.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1791\n01:29:03,902 --> 01:29:04,924\nAll right.\n\n1792\n01:29:04,924 --> 01:29:08,313\nThe last sub-adjective is\nmanage wireless security.\n\n1793\n01:29:08,313 --> 01:29:11,512\n>> That sounds like an oxymoron,\nwireless and security, right?\n\n1794\n01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:12,565\n>> Yeah, wireless security.\n\n1795\n01:29:12,565 --> 01:29:19,750\n[LAUGH] Yeah I've, I was thinking about\nit, before starting this up with you.\n\n1796\n01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:22,910\nAnd a lot of the wireless\nsecurity settings,\n\n1797\n01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:27,380\nit seems to be that it would be\nset by the network administrator.\n\n1798\n01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:31,640\nSo when you bring your laptop\nin to your business that\n\n1799\n01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:36,530\nthe security settings would already be,\nyou just connect.\n\n1800\n01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:40,500\nHe'd tell you what SSID,\nhe'd tell you the password, and\n\n1801\n01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,690\nthen the encryption and\neverything would all be I'll be free set.\n\n1802\n01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:47,875\n>> Yeah, we can definitely use,\nin a corporate environment or\n\n1803\n01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:51,935\nin a business environment we're always\nlooking for what we call centralized\n\n1804\n01:29:51,935 --> 01:29:55,808\nchange management, where rather than\ntouching every single machine and\n\n1805\n01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,930\nconfiguring these settings,\nwe would use a group policy,\n\n1806\n01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:02,756\nlike a main based group policy and\nhave the policy apply to the machines.\n\n1807\n01:30:02,756 --> 01:30:05,915\nAnd, again, that way they don't have to\nbring every single laptop over to me and\n\n1808\n01:30:05,915 --> 01:30:07,555\nI have to configure\neach one one at a time.\n\n1809\n01:30:07,555 --> 01:30:11,994\nBecause if I'm doing it that way, just\nlike with, you guys have talked about it\n\n1810\n01:30:11,994 --> 01:30:16,720\nin our networking episodes, static and\ndynamically assigning TCIP information.\n\n1811\n01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,620\nSame concept.\n\n1812\n01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:21,310\nIf I have to touch every machine,\nand configure them one at a time.\n\n1813\n01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:24,150\nWhat are the odds of me\nmaking a typo on one of them?\n\n1814\n01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:27,000\nWhat are the odds of me missing\none of those computers?\n\n1815\n01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,990\nIf you've ever seen me type,\nthe odds are pretty great, whereas if I\n\n1816\n01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:36,230\nuse a policy to do this, then I can have\nthose policies apply to the machines and\n\n1817\n01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:39,120\nI know that it's being consistently\napplied to all the machines.\n\n1818\n01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,520\nThat I've scoped that policy too.\n\n1819\n01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:45,250\nWe'll get into some, more into Group\nPolicy at the domain level when we get\n\n1820\n01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:48,890\ninto our Active Directory episodes.\n\n1821\n01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:51,805\nBut if you want to show\nthem that that policy,\n\n1822\n01:30:51,805 --> 01:30:54,430\nI don't know if you want to do that, or.\n\n1823\n01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:55,270\n>> Sure.\n>> The point is,\n\n1824\n01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:57,510\nthere are policies that we can use.\n\n1825\n01:30:57,510 --> 01:31:00,420\nTo configure the wireless\nsettings on the client computers\n\n1826\n01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:03,440\nexcept I'm not sure about the key.\n\n1827\n01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,380\nIf we're using a pre-shared key I\ndon't know that you can pass that out.\n\n1828\n01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:07,600\nBut we will check it out and see.\n\n1829\n01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,508\n>> In the policy thing\n>> What did you want to check?\n\n1830\n01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:13,495\nI'm following you.\n\n1831\n01:31:13,495 --> 01:31:18,754\n>> Let's jump in there, browse that so\n\n1832\n01:31:18,754 --> 01:31:25,580\nthere's a computer that\nis a domain member.\n\n1833\n01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:26,180\nRight.\n\n1834\n01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:29,190\nI mean policies can control so\nmany things-\n\n1835\n01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:30,640\n>> Just about everything that you could\n\n1836\n01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:33,800\nconfigure on your machine you\ncan configure through policy.\n\n1837\n01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:39,029\n>> And so we can also choose to do\nthe same with wireless policies.\n\n1838\n01:31:39,029 --> 01:31:40,155\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1839\n01:31:40,155 --> 01:31:47,310\n>> Now this setting is only on,\non a domain controller.\n\n1840\n01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:50,940\nJump over here it's domain controller,\nwe'll get more into it later.\n\n1841\n01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:55,351\n>> I'm looking forward to that day too,\ngosh I love me some Active Directory.\n\n1842\n01:31:55,351 --> 01:32:01,010\n>> So let's see, server manager.\n\n1843\n01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:11,310\n>> So as Nate's navigating through here\nhe's opened up server manager on dc 1 and\n\n1844\n01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:14,910\nhe's navigating down to the group\npolicy and management consul.\n\n1845\n01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:23,670\nAnd he is gonna modify the default\ndomain policy it looks like which will.\n\n1846\n01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:27,022\nWe'll let it slide [LAUGH].\n\n1847\n01:32:27,022 --> 01:32:30,586\nOne of those things we'll learn when we\nget to active directory, which is down\n\n1848\n01:32:30,586 --> 01:32:34,426\nthe road, we'll learn that a lot of times\nwe leave the default domain policy alone.\n\n1849\n01:32:34,426 --> 01:32:37,678\nThe best practice says to create your\nown policies and modify those, but\n\n1850\n01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:39,916\nall of the policies have\nthe same options in them so\n\n1851\n01:32:39,916 --> 01:32:43,190\nit doesn't matter which policy we pull\nup just to show you the settings.\n\n1852\n01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:48,388\nSo what he's gonna do is he's gonna\nnavigate into the computer configuration,\n\n1853\n01:32:48,388 --> 01:32:52,431\nWindows settings, security settings,\nand then wireless network policies.\n\n1854\n01:33:01,332 --> 01:33:02,310\n>> All right-\n>> And yeah, and\n\n1855\n01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,030\nhe doesn't have any policies\nout there currently.\n\n1856\n01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:09,240\nSo we can right click new policy.\n\n1857\n01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:12,030\nAnd the same options that we would\n\n1858\n01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:14,850\nneed to reconfigure if we were\ndoing this manually, right?\n\n1859\n01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:18,600\nIf you go and connect to a wireless\nnetwork, the first thing you need to know\n\n1860\n01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,410\nis the name of the network\nyou're trying to connect or\n\n1861\n01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:25,930\nthe SSID there eee what he's got and\nwhat he's gonna do here.\n\n1862\n01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:27,570\nHe's gonna give his policy a name.\n\n1863\n01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:32,260\nAnd the name there is just to\ndescribe the policy, right.\n\n1864\n01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:33,927\nIt's not the name of\nthe actual access point.\n\n1865\n01:33:38,677 --> 01:33:41,394\nHe's gonna put a nice,\ndescriptive description there.\n\n1866\n01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:48,490\nAnd if we wanna use the,\noh, let's talk about that,\n\n1867\n01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:51,392\ngood, ad hoc and infrastructure.\n\n1868\n01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:57,995\n>> [LAUGH] Little pause there,\nI saw the excitement, like woo.\n\n1869\n01:33:57,995 --> 01:34:01,802\n>> When we set up wireless networks,\nwe have two options, we can call...\n\n1870\n01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:06,740\nAd hoc networks we can do infrastructure\nmode, ad hoc meeting we've got two\n\n1871\n01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:10,440\nwireless clients that are gonna\ncommunicate directly with each other.\n\n1872\n01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,180\nAlmost think of it like a little wireless\nword group so they, there's no access\n\n1873\n01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:18,650\npoint that they're connecting to first,\nthey're connecting directly to each other.\n\n1874\n01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:23,030\nSo if you've got a couple, some guys who\nwant to go down to the conference room.\n\n1875\n01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:24,490\nAnd they've got their laptops with them,\nand\n\n1876\n01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:27,750\nthey just want to set up a little quick,\nfile sharing between them.\n\n1877\n01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:29,790\nThey can bring up a little\nquick ad hoc network,\n\n1878\n01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:33,100\nhave all those machines connect to each\nother and they could share resources.\n\n1879\n01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:37,670\nIt does not give you access to the wired\nportion network, so you're just\n\n1880\n01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:41,520\nconnecting to the other wireless clients\nthat are part of your ad hoc network.\n\n1881\n01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,030\nInfrastructure mode is when we\nhave that wireless access point.\n\n1882\n01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:48,910\nWhere we would have a WAP or\n\n1883\n01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:54,060\nwireless access point, that is\ngoing to be wired into our network,\n\n1884\n01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:58,340\nand then the wireless Clients connect\nto that wireless access point.\n\n1885\n01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:01,440\nAnd then from there, can connect to\nthe wired portion of the network, all\n\n1886\n01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,600\nthe resources that are available there,\nas well as to the other wireless clients.\n\n1887\n01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,470\nAnd when you're in infrastructure mode,\nif you get two\n\n1888\n01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:11,220\nwireless clients that are talking to\neach other in infrastructure mode,\n\n1889\n01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:12,960\nthey are not talking\ndirectly to each other.\n\n1890\n01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,150\nThey are going through\nthe access point and\n\n1891\n01:35:15,150 --> 01:35:16,870\nthen back out to the other\nwireless client.\n\n1892\n01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,590\nSo that's the difference there between\nad hoc and infrastructure mode.\n\n1893\n01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,090\n>> And then SSID?\n\n1894\n01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:25,610\nRight.\n\n1895\n01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:31,900\n>> SSIDs, my security, if I can\nactually remember the actual acronym.\n\n1896\n01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:33,517\nSecurity Set Identifier.\n\n1897\n01:35:33,517 --> 01:35:39,095\nYou can almost think of this as\nthe name of the wireless access point.\n\n1898\n01:35:39,095 --> 01:35:44,780\nWhen you go into your Windows machine and\nyou click on your little.\n\n1899\n01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,580\nWireless icon down in your system tray,\nand that bar slides out, and\n\n1900\n01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,060\nyou've got a list of all\nthose access points there.\n\n1901\n01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,350\nThat's the SSID.\n\n1902\n01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:58,210\nThe access points themselves\nare beaconing out this name, as well as\n\n1903\n01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:01,730\nwhat encryption they're using, and things\nlike that, what channel they're using.\n\n1904\n01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:04,960\nAnd that's what populates that list,\nand then you can pick.\n\n1905\n01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,264\nWhat he's doing here is specifying the\nname of a network that we wanna connect\n\n1906\n01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:12,769\nto, or the SSID of the network,\nthe wireless access point, so\n\n1907\n01:36:12,769 --> 01:36:14,180\nthe chickabow network.\n\n1908\n01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:18,908\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1909\n01:36:18,908 --> 01:36:23,925\nand below that We can set,\nyeah, configure what.\n\n1910\n01:36:23,925 --> 01:36:27,625\nSo when this client is in range of it,\nwhat do we want to do?\n\n1911\n01:36:27,625 --> 01:36:29,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Connect automatically\n\n1912\n01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:33,865\nwhen it's in range, connect to a more\npreferred network if available.\n\n1913\n01:36:33,865 --> 01:36:38,585\nWhen we set up our network\npriority levels, or\n\n1914\n01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:42,465\nthe last option, connect even if\nthe network is not broadcasting.\n\n1915\n01:36:42,465 --> 01:36:45,335\nSo if we choose, on the access point side,\n\n1916\n01:36:45,335 --> 01:36:50,850\nto not I guess beacon\nout the network name,\n\n1917\n01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:55,730\nthen, yeah,\nI guess this profile would work well.\n\n1918\n01:36:55,730 --> 01:36:57,510\nSo it's not broadcasting, but.\n\n1919\n01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:58,010\n>> Exactly.\n\n1920\n01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,560\nYes.\n\n1921\n01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,620\nThat's a good point.\n\n1922\n01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:03,350\nWe need to talk about that because one\nof the methods that we can use to help\n\n1923\n01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:07,400\nsecure our wireless networks is to disable\nthat beaconing process that I was just\n\n1924\n01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,580\ntalking about.\n\n1925\n01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:12,450\nBecause if I'm beaconing out it\nmakes it very easy to find and\n\n1926\n01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:16,940\nconnect to the wireless network\nfrom my actual users, my employees.\n\n1927\n01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,180\nAlso makes it very easy for\n\n1928\n01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:22,530\nthe guy in the creepy van in the parking\nlot to see your wireless access point.\n\n1929\n01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:24,580\nCause it's going to show\nup in his list as well.\n\n1930\n01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:27,219\nPeople that are walking by,\nyou know, whatever.\n\n1931\n01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:33,220\nIf we disable that beaconing,\nit's not going to show up in those lists.\n\n1932\n01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:35,500\nBut it does now mean that for\n\n1933\n01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:39,838\nan authorized user, it's not going\nto show up in their list either.\n\n1934\n01:37:39,838 --> 01:37:43,910\nThey're going to have to manually connect\nto it by typing the name of the SSID, or\n\n1935\n01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:46,490\nin this case, use a policy to push\nthe settings out to them, and\n\n1936\n01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:47,932\nthen they don't need to know the name.\n\n1937\n01:37:47,932 --> 01:37:48,733\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1938\n01:37:48,733 --> 01:37:50,475\nActually, sorry.\n\n1939\n01:37:50,475 --> 01:37:51,518\nMm-hm.\n\n1940\n01:37:51,518 --> 01:37:53,955\nBut.\n\n1941\n01:37:53,955 --> 01:37:57,960\n>> And then we've got\nthe security side of things.\n\n1942\n01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:01,810\nNice, so, yeah,\nwe've gotta make sure that our,\n\n1943\n01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:07,316\nwhatever our access point is set to\naccept, the client is set to as well.\n\n1944\n01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:08,510\nSo, they're going to have to match, and\n\n1945\n01:38:08,510 --> 01:38:12,250\nyou've got a few different authentication\nprotocols that we can choose from there.\n\n1946\n01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,750\nOpen, meaning?\n\n1947\n01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:18,780\n>> I got public, like a coffee shop?\n\n1948\n01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,460\n>> Yeah,\nno authentication required at all, right?\n\n1949\n01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:21,870\nDoesn't matter.\nDon't have to authenticate.\n\n1950\n01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:22,955\nAnybody can connect to it.\n\n1951\n01:38:22,955 --> 01:38:30,240\nShared, good old pre-shared key.\n\n1952\n01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,800\nWhat do we got, WPA and WPA2 left there?\n\n1953\n01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:34,340\nWPA and WPA2.\n\n1954\n01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:36,733\nAre we ready to go into those?\n\n1955\n01:38:36,733 --> 01:38:41,677\n>> Well they're different\n\n1956\n01:38:41,677 --> 01:38:46,525\nways of securing stuff.\n\n1957\n01:38:46,525 --> 01:38:47,235\nYeah.\n\n1958\n01:38:47,235 --> 01:38:52,885\n>> We've got, well, shared is really,\nin this case, we're looking at what, WEP?\n\n1959\n01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:54,055\nWired Equivalent Privacy,\n\n1960\n01:38:54,055 --> 01:38:56,325\nwhich is, everybody's heard\nthe horror stories about WEP.\n\n1961\n01:38:56,325 --> 01:38:59,365\nWEP is not very secure,\nit's pretty easy to crack.\n\n1962\n01:38:59,365 --> 01:39:04,015\nAnybody can download something from the\nInternet, and capture a few packets, and\n\n1963\n01:39:04,015 --> 01:39:04,971\nthey can break your WEP.\n\n1964\n01:39:04,971 --> 01:39:07,872\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know, that doesn't sound right,\n\n1965\n01:39:07,872 --> 01:39:08,780\ndoes it?\n\n1966\n01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:14,500\nWPA and WPA2 are some more secure\nauthentication methods that we can use.\n\n1967\n01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:19,440\nWPA, my WiFi protected access\ndeveloped by the WiFi Alliance.\n\n1968\n01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:24,000\nEverybody knew the web\nwas relatively insecure.\n\n1969\n01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,450\nThe IEEE who puts out these standards\n\n1970\n01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:28,650\ncan be a little slow at\nratifying a new standard.\n\n1971\n01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:30,200\nThey've got a lot to go through.\n\n1972\n01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:33,410\nThey've got to test and test and retest.\n\n1973\n01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:37,340\nThey have to get unanimous\nagreement on these protocols.\n\n1974\n01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:39,400\nAnd in the meantime nobody's\nimplementing wireless networks,\n\n1975\n01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,830\nnobody's buying these\ncompanies wireless products.\n\n1976\n01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:45,212\nSo a few companies got together,\ncreated the WiFi alliance, and said,\n\n1977\n01:39:45,212 --> 01:39:46,680\nwe're going to fix this.\n\n1978\n01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:51,200\nAnd they created this WP\nthis WiFi protected access\n\n1979\n01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:55,880\nwhich uses some stronger\nprotocols within it.\n\n1980\n01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:59,650\nSo instead of using,\nwhat did we use in WEP?\n\n1981\n01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:05,010\nRC4.\nWhere as in WPA and WPA2, we're going to\n\n1982\n01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:09,840\nuse TKIP, temporal kit integrity protocol\nand AES for advanced encryption standards.\n\n1983\n01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:13,330\nBoth of those methods support.\n\n1984\n01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:17,030\nTo different authentication methods.\n\n1985\n01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,950\nRight?\nWPA and\n\n1986\n01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:22,290\nWPA2 both have a personal option and\nan enterprise option.\n\n1987\n01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:27,310\nIf we do WPA2 enterprise, that's going\nto give us the ability to run with\n\n1988\n01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:29,339\ncertificates for authentication methods.\n\n1989\n01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:33,970\nLot of home networks aren't going to\nbe set up to use certificates for\n\n1990\n01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:35,540\ntheir authentication.\n\n1991\n01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:37,210\nSo we have WPA personal and\n\n1992\n01:40:37,210 --> 01:40:42,350\nWPA 2 personal, which we can go back\nto using a good old pre shared key, and\n\n1993\n01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:48,220\nstill have the choices for\nthe stronger encryption algorithms.\n\n1994\n01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:52,930\n>> Right, yeah, I guess just\nclicking through this little wizard.\n\n1995\n01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:58,100\nYeah, you know, we can choose smart card,\ncertificate stuff, which might be useful\n\n1996\n01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:02,940\nfor somebody who uses smart cards and\nwhat not.\n\n1997\n01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:04,860\n>> Yeah, and much more secure method for\n\n1998\n01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:07,650\nauthentication than say any\ntype of free shared key.\n\n1999\n01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:10,560\nBut it also requires a complete\nseparate infrastructure.\n\n2000\n01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,280\nWe've got to have the ability\nto issue the certificates.\n\n2001\n01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,420\nWe've got to have the smart\ncard generators, you know,\n\n2002\n01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:17,690\nto load those certificates\nup on the smart cards.\n\n2003\n01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:19,980\nSo in a corporate environment, absolutely.\n\n2004\n01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:23,800\nIn a home office, you know, not so\nconvenient because I don't have the money,\n\n2005\n01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:27,520\nthe manpower to implement and\nmaintain that kind of infrastructure.\n\n2006\n01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,504\nSo that's why they give us that,\n\n2007\n01:41:28,504 --> 01:41:31,620\npersonal option where we\ncan use that pre share key.\n\n2008\n01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:33,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n2009\n01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,980\nGoodness, I clicked on\nthe advance tab to bring up yet\n\n2010\n01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:42,470\nanother menu of real fun stuff.\n\n2011\n01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:50,080\nAnd yeah, good things that,\nsome of this more nitty gritty stuff,\n\n2012\n01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:55,430\nwe'll cover more in depth later,\nwhen it's, yeah.\n\n2013\n01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:57,420\n>> When we're studying for\nthe Windows 8 exam,\n\n2014\n01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:00,720\nthe main thing is that we understand\nthe options that we have available.\n\n2015\n01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:05,270\nWe gotta know how to configure the client,\nto connect to the access point, so\n\n2016\n01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:09,360\nI have to be able to go into those\nwireless settings in there and\n\n2017\n01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:12,320\nmake sure I can choose\nthe right options to match\n\n2018\n01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:15,440\nwhat the access point is looking for\nso that I can connect to it.\n\n2019\n01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,320\nOr we could use,\n\n2020\n01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:20,890\nmaybe the administrator uses a policy\nto push those settings out to us.\n\n2021\n01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:24,280\nWe'll definitely talk about\n802.1x in another episode when\n\n2022\n01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:27,550\nwe get into a little bit of radius and\nthe short version is, so\n\n2023\n01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:29,348\nwe don't leave you hanging\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2024\n01:42:29,348 --> 01:42:30,860\n>> I hate saying hey this is 802.1x,\n\n2025\n01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:34,370\nwe'll talk about it later.\n\n2026\n01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:35,220\nNo cliffhangers?\n\n2027\n01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,196\n>> Yeah, no cliffhangers.\n\n2028\n01:42:36,196 --> 01:42:39,680\nWell, I'm going to try to tease them and\nget them up on the edge of their seat and\n\n2029\n01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,310\ntune in for that next episode.\n\n2030\n01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:42,360\n>> Nice.\n>> Because\n\n2031\n01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:45,290\nradius is where we take\nthe authentication off.\n\n2032\n01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:49,725\nAgain, I don't want to start using these\nterms, so, in the dialog we call it\n\n2033\n01:42:49,725 --> 01:42:54,810\n802.1X, which is the IEEE standard for,\ndo I dare say it?\n\n2034\n01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:55,950\nAre you going to laugh at me, aren't you?\n\n2035\n01:42:55,950 --> 01:42:56,510\n>> Oh no, go.\n>> Remote\n\n2036\n01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:58,580\nAuthentication Dialed-In User Service.\n\n2037\n01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:02,870\n[LAUGH] All right, but\nbasically the short version is,\n\n2038\n01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:05,900\nwe're going to take the authentication\noff of the access point and\n\n2039\n01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:08,960\nmove it back to a server\ninside the corporate network.\n\n2040\n01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:11,640\nUsually the access points\nsitting out in the DMZ,\n\n2041\n01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:15,900\nout in our screen sub net which we've\ntalked about in our network episodes.\n\n2042\n01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,790\nAnd this is going to take\nthe authentication off.\n\n2043\n01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:21,430\nWe know the access points have\npretty weak authentication.\n\n2044\n01:43:21,430 --> 01:43:26,060\nSo if we take it off that access point and\nput it back in a Microsoft world,\n\n2045\n01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:27,560\nthat would be an NPS server,\n\n2046\n01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:31,460\na network policy server,\nradius being a platform independent term.\n\n2047\n01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:35,600\nSo we can move that authentication\noutside of the access point.\n\n2048\n01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:41,118\nBut again, that's another thing you're\ngoing to see in a corporate environment,\n\n2049\n01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:42,749\nnot in a [INAUDIBLE] and for\n\n2050\n01:43:42,749 --> 01:43:47,140\nthis exam, that's probably about\nwhat we need to know about it.\n\n2051\n01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:48,820\n>> Well, yeah, right on.\n\n2052\n01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:50,390\nGood little bits.\n\n2053\n01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,900\nIP6 stuff.\n\n2054\n01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:51,960\n>> Is that the time already?\n\n2055\n01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:52,480\nGood god?\n\n2056\n01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:55,100\nThere's so much more we could talk about.\n\n2057\n01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:58,160\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n2058\n01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:58,914\nYou've got more.\n\n2059\n01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:01,080\nGood episode, Mike.\n\n2060\n01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:01,680\n>> Thank you.\n\n2061\n01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:02,920\n>> Anything to\n>> Same to you.\n\n2062\n01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:03,670\n>> Thank you.\n\n2063\n01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:07,290\nAnything else to add as\nwe come down to a close.\n\n2064\n01:44:07,290 --> 01:44:08,190\n>> No.\nTune in next time.\n\n2065\n01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:10,780\nWe might have to go back into a little\nbit more on the wireless security.\n\n2066\n01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:16,530\nWe didn't get a chance to talk about\ndoing some MAC address filtering and\n\n2067\n01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:17,460\ndisabling the sieve.\n\n2068\n01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:20,760\nWe talked a little bit\nabout disabling the SID and\n\n2069\n01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,950\nsome other things that we\ncould mention in there.\n\n2070\n01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:29,200\nRogue access points, SID spoofing,\nand some other cool stuff, so.\n\n2071\n01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> Tune in again.\n\n2072\n01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:31,650\nWe'll get back to that stuff.\n\n2073\n01:44:31,650 --> 01:44:36,040\n>> Yeah, I'll whip up something that\nwe can demo over the machine so\n\n2074\n01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:37,750\nit's not just a lot of talking.\n\n2075\n01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:38,680\n>> Sounds fun.\n\n2076\n01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:39,320\nSweet.\n\n2077\n01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:43,240\nAll right, well, tomorrow,\nanother great episode tomorrow.\n\n2078\n01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:44,710\nMike, are you going to come back?\n\n2079\n01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:46,330\n>> I'd love to if you'll have me.\n\n2080\n01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:48,820\nYup. Sweet.\n>> I didn't break things too bad today.\n\n2081\n01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:50,710\n>> Well you got my IP software working.\n\n2082\n01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:52,810\nSo that was good, I appreciate it.\n\n2083\n01:44:52,810 --> 01:44:56,424\nAll righ wonderful, well,\ntune in tomorrow, and we'll see you then.\n\n2084\n01:44:56,424 --> 01:45:06,424\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:41,060\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,540\n>> How's everybody doing?\n\n5\n00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,320\n>> Mike, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,510\n>> Fantastic, how you doing today?\n\n7\n00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,430\n>> Doing great, doing great.\n\n8\n00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,830\nThanks for coming back on the show.\n\n9\n00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,750\n>> Yeah, thanks for having me.\n\n10\n00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,750\nHad a lot of fun last time.\n\n11\n00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,170\nLooking forward to it again.\n\n12\n00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,275\n>> So today,\nwe've got some real fun stuff lined up.\n\n13\n00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:54,302\nMm-hm.\n\n14\n00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:59,570\n>> It is configure remote management and\nthe sub objectives for\n\n15\n00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,235\nthis topic, choose the appropriate\nremote management tools.\n\n16\n00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:06,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Configure remote management settings,\n\n17\n00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,230\nand modify settings remotely using MMCs,\nor\n\n18\n00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,790\nWindows PowerShell, but\nwe're gonna use both.\n\n19\n00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,860\n>> Cool.\nWe'll use them all.\n\n20\n00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,680\nWe'll go through all of them, yeah.\n\n21\n00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,050\nLots of fun, lots of fun, and when we get\nout there in our corporate environments,\n\n22\n00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,880\nwe really don't want,\nwe like to remote manage, right?\n\n23\n00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,140\nCuz I don't want to have to run around and\ntouch every single machine.\n\n24\n00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,216\nAnd some of the machines might not even\nbe in the same building, the same city,\n\n25\n00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:27,731\nthe same country.\n\n26\n00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:31,540\nSo being able to remotely manage these\nmachines is a very important part.\n\n27\n00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,943\nWe'll take a look at all\nthe different tools that we have.\n\n28\n00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:38,900\n>> Remote management stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,148\nI mean, if you got a bunch of servers\ncrammed into a closet somewhere,\n\n30\n00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:45,596\nyou can't give, I guess you could, but\n\n31\n00:01:45,596 --> 00:01:50,360\nit wouldn't be ideal to put monitors on\nall of them, keyboards on all of them.\n\n32\n00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,100\n>> No, no.\n\n33\n00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,580\nAnd even here, with our network,\n\n34\n00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,960\nwhere all the servers that I manage\nare here in the building with me, but\n\n35\n00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,820\nthey're in that server closest, and\nI'm not going in that server closet.\n\n36\n00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,210\nI mean, you go in there and\nit's It's loud, and\n\n37\n00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,240\nit's cool because you've got a super duper\nAC in there keeping everything cool,\n\n38\n00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,730\nbut you got all the switches and\nthe routers and the fans on those and\n\n39\n00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,530\nthe power supply's on all the servers,\nand then you've got the KBM to pull out,\n\n40\n00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,270\ntry to figure out how to switch between,\nno.\n\n41\n00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,630\nI just sit in my little office and\nI pull up my machine and\n\n42\n00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,180\nI connect to them remotely and\nmanage them from there.\n\n43\n00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,141\nMuch, much easier.\n\n44\n00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,400\n>> Yeah [LAUGH] You know\n>> Yeah, and not only that.\n\n45\n00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,690\nBut yeah, it's the ideal situation.\n\n46\n00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,870\nIt's like you have a big, comfy chair,\nand you can just sit back, and\n\n47\n00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,370\npeople are like, hey, I need something\nsomething, and you pause your game, right?\n\n48\n00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,800\nYou flip over, and hammer out a couple\ncommands and if it fixes a thing and\n\n49\n00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,080\nyou can switch back to your game and\nkeep going.\n\n50\n00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,705\n>> Now that we've unblocked Steam\nfrom our other episode, right?\n\n51\n00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:48,510\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,800\n>> Shoot,\nI said my time management, right?\n\n53\n00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,480\nI mean, really, with remote management,\nyou can manage from anywhere.\n\n54\n00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,265\nAnywhere meaning like the beach\nwith a MaiTai in your hand.\n\n55\n00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:59,580\n[LAUGH] They call you up and you just,\n\n56\n00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,560\nsure I can\n>> Take care of\n\n57\n00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,094\nit\n>> Lots of fun\n\n58\n00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,810\n>> Yup, lots of fun, and\n\n59\n00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,510\nyeah I think, not only the goal to\nbe able to not leave a chair or\n\n60\n00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,330\nhave to leave your game for too long but\n>> You know,\n\n61\n00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,515\nit seems like the least amount of\nadministrative efforts, right?\n\n62\n00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:17,660\n>> Mm-hm.\nAbsolutely.\n\n63\n00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,100\n>> Spending the least amount of time-\n>> Yes.\n\n64\n00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,170\n>> On something, but I guess efficiently.\n\n65\n00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,020\nSo, you can get more done,\ndo it quicker, do it better.\n\n66\n00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,560\n>> Yup.\n\n67\n00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,380\n>> Yeah.\nThings like that.\n\n68\n00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,120\nSo-\n>> And\n\n69\n00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,620\nyou've got to\n>> Two,\n\n70\n00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,520\nyou're gonna have people\nthat you delegate to, right?\n\n71\n00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,100\nYou've got your managers that you might\nwanna delegate, your DNS managers, or\n\n72\n00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,730\nyour DHCP managers, or\nsomething like that.\n\n73\n00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,000\nAnd, I wanna give them the ability, but\nthey can't get in the server closet.\n\n74\n00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,580\nThey don't have a key to my server closet.\n\n75\n00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,480\nThey can't get in there and\nphysically touch the machines, so\n\n76\n00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,620\nthe only way they can do their\njob is through remote management.\n\n77\n00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,500\nWell sweet, well right on.\n\n78\n00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,430\nSo, what kind of tools do\nwe have to do this right.\n\n79\n00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,620\nThere will be four tools, I guess\nspecifically, that we will go over today.\n\n80\n00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,980\nRemote desktop.\n\n81\n00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,430\nNow remote desktop kind of,\nI think, a little of both.\n\n82\n00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,340\nIt allows you to connect to another\nmachine, see their desktop,\n\n83\n00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,890\nand interact with it as if you were\nsitting right there at that computer.\n\n84\n00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,410\n>> And a lot of you probably use\nremote desktop in your home network,\n\n85\n00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,209\nmaybe, to connect one\nof your other machines.\n\n86\n00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,210\nAnd Remote Desktop is relatively easy,\nand like you said, you get that\n\n87\n00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,140\nfull desktop of that server, so you have\naccess to everything that you would have\n\n88\n00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,590\naccess to if you were physically at that\nmachine, doing an interactive logon.\n\n89\n00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,390\nSo, it's an easy option, or\n\n90\n00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,080\nit's an option that gives you\nthe ability to You do whatever you need,\n\n91\n00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,900\nthe down side of it is, the access\nlevel that's required to do that.\n\n92\n00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,600\nYou know, if I have somebody that's just\nsuppose to be able to administer DHAP,\n\n93\n00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,990\nthen I don't want to give them the ability\nto remote into that server because once\n\n94\n00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,210\nthey remote in they think they\nhave full access to servers.\n\n95\n00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,380\nSo we'll look at some other tools\nto cover something like that, but\n\n96\n00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,890\nremote desktop is a great\nremote administration.\n\n97\n00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,560\nSo, I use it here all the time.\n\n98\n00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,755\nTo remote into the server,\nand to get something done.\n\n99\n00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:12,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n100\n00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,350\nAll right.\n\n101\n00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,870\nWe've got, Win RM, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,630\nWindows Remote Management command line\nthing, and like, Win RM, and Win RS,\n\n103\n00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,870\nand they kind of go together.\n\n104\n00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,310\nSo, the command line stops.\n\n105\n00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,250\nSo, you can type something\nin on your local computer.\n\n106\n00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,970\nThen have it execute on another computer.\n\n107\n00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,800\nYou don't have the whole Windows\ndesktop display like remote.\n\n108\n00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,750\n>> As a remote desktop.\n\n109\n00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,760\nRight, right.\n\n110\n00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,710\n>> So just another way of doing it right.\n\n111\n00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,140\n>> Yeah.\nFrom the command line.\n\n112\n00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,699\nWe just gotta learn how to type.\n\n113\n00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> I like command line stuff.\n\n114\n00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,570\n>> Do you?\n\n115\n00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,260\n>> Like clicking with a mouse and\na keyboard.\n\n116\n00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,620\nIt's fun and all, but\ntyping out commands and hitting Enter and\n\n117\n00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,505\nhaving text scrolling by,\nI mean, it feels more raw right?\n\n118\n00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:56,370\n>> Mm-hm, it does.\n>> You've really got\n\n119\n00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,760\nmore power over that server.\n\n120\n00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,828\nI think that's what it is.\n\n121\n00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:00,175\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n122\n00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:03,360\nYup, it's like those 80s\ncomputer movies where all they\n\n123\n00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280\ndo is smash on a keyboard, and.\n\n124\n00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,640\n>> Yup.\n>> And do stuff.\n\n125\n00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,167\n>> Always cracks me up when you're\nwatching those TV shows and\n\n126\n00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,831\nsomebody will type, type, type, type, and\nthen like magic appears on the screen.\n\n127\n00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm like there's no way you did that\n\n128\n00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,920\nwith those four keys.\n\n129\n00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,150\nKeys you just hit, but yeah,\nwin rm definitely a good thing.\n\n130\n00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,160\n>> Yup, we've got Windows power shell.\n\n131\n00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,070\nNow, Windows power shell is this\nimmensely powerful program.\n\n132\n00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,630\nIt can do a lot of stuff.\n\n133\n00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,510\nI mean it's seems like\npeople will spend Spend.\n\n134\n00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,030\nI mean, their job is using PowerShell,\nconfiguring PowerShell.\n\n135\n00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,880\nOf course on very large scales.\n\n136\n00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,510\nIt's a real powerful program.\n\n137\n00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,910\nWe're going to use just\na little part of it.\n\n138\n00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,150\n>> Yeah, we'll touch on it.\n\n139\n00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,570\nWe could do a whole session on PowerShell.\n\n140\n00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,160\nPowerShell seems to be taking over.\n\n141\n00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,000\nIt's replacing what we did\nwith the command line.\n\n142\n00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,940\nYou hate to say it the command line\nmight be going away at some point,\n\n143\n00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,720\nbut, because we don't need,\nokay wait a second.\n\n144\n00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,260\nPowerShell really does both right?\n\n145\n00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,500\nWe can run our normal command line syntax\nfrom PowerShell, or we can use all our new\n\n146\n00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,430\nPowerShell commandlets, and You can\ndo everything through PowerShell, and\n\n147\n00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,250\nit's more than just a command line\ninterpreter, it's also a scripting engine.\n\n148\n00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,586\nSo it just gives us so\nmuch power, and really-\n\n149\n00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:20,145\n>> Power in PowerShell.\n\n150\n00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:22,450\n[LAUGH]\n>> Power in PowerShell,\n\n151\n00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,115\nPowerShell is very powerful.\n\n152\n00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:27,950\n[LAUGH] So it is,\nit's a lot of fun, and It's so\n\n153\n00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,680\nmuch easier than the command prompter,\nin my opinion.\n\n154\n00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,690\nBecause again,\nmy typing skills are limited.\n\n155\n00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,210\nI can do about ten words a minute.\n\n156\n00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,130\nMinus errors I'm down to about five words\na minute maybe, something like that.\n\n157\n00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,720\nBut with Power Show,\n\n158\n00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,360\nit'll do the auto completing of\nyour syntax as you're typing.\n\n159\n00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360\n>> Absolutely.\n\n160\n00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,320\nSo you type in the first few letters,\nyou hit tab, and it finds the command.\n\n161\n00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,000\nAnd if that's not the command you want,\n\n162\n00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,210\nyou tab again until the find\nthe command you want.\n\n163\n00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,750\nIf you go too far, you shift tab and\nyou go back to the command.\n\n164\n00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,534\nSo I mean, it's fantastic.\n\n165\n00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:59,372\nEspecially for somebody that either one,\nmaybe is not the best typer in the world\n\n166\n00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:02,814\nbut two, if you're not sure what\ncommand you want or you're looking for\n\n167\n00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:05,196\nyou think you know You can\nget in there and find it.\n\n168\n00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:06,577\nSo it's fantastic.\n\n169\n00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:07,203\nI love it.\n\n170\n00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:08,539\nI do like PowerShell.\n\n171\n00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:09,961\nI'm slowly becoming a convert.\n\n172\n00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,290\n>> Right?\n\n173\n00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:11,850\n>> Yes.\n>> Or\n\n174\n00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,285\nyou could, type all your\ncommands in the script, right?\n\n175\n00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,860\nAnd you don't have to type anymore,\nyou just execute scripts.\n\n176\n00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,770\n>> Absolutely.\nHey if it's something that you gotta do on\n\n177\n00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,610\na daily basis or once a week or\nsomething like that.\n\n178\n00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,210\nShoot yeah, put it in a script and\nthen just execute the script.\n\n179\n00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:24,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,830\n>> And good to go.\n\n181\n00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,500\n>> Yep.\nIt does seem like something.\n\n182\n00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,633\nLet's say if you had to log into\na server it would create a user account.\n\n183\n00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:32,313\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n184\n00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,180\n>> So if you fire up your desktop.\n\n185\n00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,259\nYou go to the computers and users, right?\n\n186\n00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,020\n>> Mm-hm.\nActivate users and computers.\n\n187\n00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,840\n>> Yep.\nYou go in there and create stuff and\n\n188\n00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,720\nclick through the menus.\n\n189\n00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,590\nAnd then boom.\n\n190\n00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,370\nWell I mean you could\ngo through PowerShell.\n\n191\n00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,555\nRight?\nOf course, if you knew the commands.\n\n192\n00:08:47,555 --> 00:08:48,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then,\n\n193\n00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,930\nI mean, you type out one line, right?\n\n194\n00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,930\n>> Right.\n>> Well, a series of commands,\n\n195\n00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,680\nhit Enter and it's done, right?\n\n196\n00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,100\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pull up the little console,\n\n197\n00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,975\nand, you know.\n\n198\n00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:57,920\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Can be faster in some cases,\n\n199\n00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,150\n>> Oh, yeah, fantastic, it is great,\n\n200\n00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,880\nyou can.\n\n201\n00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,640\nA good example.\n\n202\n00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,070\nLet's say I wanna change the department\nattribute on 20 user accounts.\n\n203\n00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,940\n>> All right.\n\n204\n00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,750\n>> Well, I could go into one user account\nat a time and double-click on it.\n\n205\n00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,490\nAnd set that department value.\n\n206\n00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,920\nAnd then go to the next one and\npull up its properties and set that value.\n\n207\n00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,870\nOr I can go into PowerShell and I can take\none command that retrieves the 20 users,\n\n208\n00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,540\nand there's great filtering capabilities,\nand things like that.\n\n209\n00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,950\nAnd then I can pipe the results of\nthat command, into the next command.\n\n210\n00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,350\nWhich sets their department\nattribute to sales, or whatever.\n\n211\n00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,240\nSo with one click, or one simple command.\n\n212\n00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,820\nI set all 20 of that at one time.\n\n213\n00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,080\n>> Once you get used to PowerShell,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,160\n>> Like I said, I'm a slow convert,\n\n215\n00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,070\nI like my GUI interface.\n\n216\n00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,510\nOnce you get good at PowerShell, and\n\n217\n00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,140\nyou learn your commands, you can be so\nmuch more efficient, so much faster.\n\n218\n00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,856\nWhich just means more time for Steam.\n\n219\n00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,076\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well I mean,\n\n220\n00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:53,863\nthat's what it's all about\n>> Yeah,\n\n221\n00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:55,260\nwell getting the highest is a lot of work.\n\n222\n00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,120\n>> It really is.\n\n223\n00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,290\nYou gotta train, and anyhow.\n\n224\n00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,450\nSo we'll go for a while on that.\n\n225\n00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,330\nAll right, last tool that we'll\ndiscuss today is the RSAT,\n\n226\n00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,720\nRemote Server Administration Tools.\n\n227\n00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,400\nIs that right?\n>> Yep,\n\n228\n00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,510\nremote server administration tools,\nfantastic there.\n\n229\n00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,110\nAnd that just gives me the ability, like\nwe were talking about remote management,\n\n230\n00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,200\nif you're sitting at your Windows 8 client\nand your job is to manage those DHCP\n\n231\n00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,050\nservers that are here in your office,\nbut also in Pensacola, and also out in\n\n232\n00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,960\nBirmingham, I need the DNS console which\nis not part of my Windows 8 client.\n\n233\n00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,100\nSo we need to get the tools that we\nneed to remotely manage those machines.\n\n234\n00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,680\nAnd we can download those\nfree from Microsoft.\n\n235\n00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,298\nRSAT, R-S-A-T or Remote Server\nAdministration Tools, install them,\n\n236\n00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:45,260\nand I think we're gonna do that in\nour demo here, we'll install them and\n\n237\n00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,930\nwe'll take a look at it.\n\n238\n00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,980\nSo we'll talk a little bit more about how\nyou install them cuz it is kinda funky\n\n239\n00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,750\nright, when you go and install them\ndoesn't look like anything changed,\n\n240\n00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,740\nyou like wait, where did all my tools go?\n\n241\n00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,600\nAnd you got one more step to do before\nyou get that access those tools though.\n\n242\n00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,523\n>> I just installed it\nlike five minutes ago.\n\n243\n00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:05,969\n>> Did you already install it?\n\n244\n00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:06,618\n>> Yeah. On accident. >> That's cool.\nThat's good.\n\n245\n00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:08,664\n>> All right.\n>> [LAUGH] We'll talk about it anyway,\n\n246\n00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:10,590\nwe'll show you what he did.\n\n247\n00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,890\n>> Yeah, now, I mean, so,\nwe won't be going into how.\n\n248\n00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:20,880\nWe'll use the tool and\nnot say how to configure DNS and DHCP.\n\n249\n00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,620\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n>> It's just the idea of using the tool\n\n250\n00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,592\nfor remote management.\n\n251\n00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:27,580\n>> Yep. Right. We've got other\nsessions where we're gonna show you\n\n252\n00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,520\nguys how to work with DNS and work DHCP.\n\n253\n00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,480\nHere we're just learning how to\nremotely manage those services but\n\n254\n00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,330\nnot learning those services just yet.\n\n255\n00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,700\nNot for this class.\n\n256\n00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,580\n>> Right.\nNot yet.\n\n257\n00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,210\n>> Yep.\n\n258\n00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,520\n>> All right, well sweet.\n\n259\n00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,750\nYeah, I guess we move on to the next one?\n\n260\n00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,385\n>> Break time.\n\n261\n00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,670\n[LAUGH] Oh, man!\n\n262\n00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,540\nAll right.\n\n263\n00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,618\n>> So let's see.\n\n264\n00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:50,640\nSo we talked about the tools\nthat we have to choose from.\n\n265\n00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,120\nNow let's kinda go through them and take\na peek at each one, and then we can talk\n\n266\n00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,080\nabout why we might choose this tool over\na different tool in different situations.\n\n267\n00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,370\nSound fun?\n\n268\n00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,110\n>> Yeah,\nthat's a great way of putting it, Mike.\n\n269\n00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,820\n>> It was.\n\n270\n00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,350\n>> Thank you.\n>> That's nice, Steve.\n\n271\n00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,574\nYou have.\n\n272\n00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:07,922\nAll right, we won't get into all the.\n\n273\n00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:09,892\n>> He's got something on his nose.\n\n274\n00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> My gosh.\n\n275\n00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,364\n>> All right, first thing we'll\ntake a look at is remote desktop.\n\n276\n00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:19,119\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Remote desktop is, you know what,\n\n277\n00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:22,280\nI guess we've already talked about it.\n\n278\n00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,860\nLet's just fire it up.\n\n279\n00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,680\n>> Let's fire it up, and let's see it.\n\n280\n00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,900\nAnd it is a pretty common one.\n\n281\n00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,070\nIt's one that a lot of people have already\nplayed with cuz it's in their home\n\n282\n00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,790\nnetworks to get from one machine to\nanother and as Nate gets it fired up and\n\n283\n00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,345\nour producer over there switches us over\n>> Director.\n\n284\n00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:39,130\n>> Director, sorry.\n\n285\n00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,775\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n286\n00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:43,395\nBeautiful.\n\n287\n00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,745\nRemote desktop is just that.\n\n288\n00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:48,785\nYou're gonna take that remote\ncomputer's desktop and\n\n289\n00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:52,270\ndisplay it in a window\non your local computer.\n\n290\n00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,780\nSo it's just like you were\nsitting at that remote machine.\n\n291\n00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,170\n>> Now this machine right here.\n\n292\n00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,660\nThis is a Windows server.\n\n293\n00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,540\nWe're going to go from this\nWindows server machine and\n\n294\n00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,250\nwe will remote desktop into well,\nwe'll do it backwards.\n\n295\n00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,550\n>> You want to do it the other way?\n\n296\n00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,610\n>> Client to-\n>> Yeah, let's do it the other way.\n\n297\n00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,610\n>> Server.\n>> All right.\n\n298\n00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,890\nProbably more common in a corporate\nenvironment, is you're gonna be sitting at\n\n299\n00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,400\nyour Windows 8 machine, and you need to\nremotely administer one of your servers.\n\n300\n00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,810\nSo, let's do it that way.\n\n301\n00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,540\n>> All right.\n\n302\n00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,960\n>> If we have it all set up,\nand if we don't, we'll fix it.\n\n303\n00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,480\n>> Mmhmm.\n\n304\n00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,330\nWell, yeah.\n\n305\n00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,180\n>> Woohoo.\n>> Alright, well, first things first.\n\n306\n00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,120\nRight.\n\n307\n00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,880\nWe need to check and make sure\nthat remote desktop is turned on.\n\n308\n00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,730\n>> We do, because by default in our\nWindows operating systems remote\n\n309\n00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,480\nassistance is going to enabled,\nremote desktop is going to be disabled.\n\n310\n00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,180\nAnd we'll cover remote assistance\nin another session here, but so\n\n311\n00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,960\nwe have to go in and check on it.\n\n312\n00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,405\n>> Yep, and it's in,\nyou have the computer properties.\n\n313\n00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:48,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n314\n00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,830\n>> We'll go to advanced,\nwell advanced or remote settings.\n\n315\n00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,885\n>> It's kind of funny there, right?\n\n316\n00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:53,181\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because you've got those two different\n\n317\n00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:54,280\nlinks, one says Remote settings,\n\n318\n00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,480\nwhich takes you directly to the remote\ntab of your System Properties.\n\n319\n00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,840\nThe other one says Advanced settings,\n\n320\n00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,030\nwhich takes you to the advanced\ntab of your System Properties.\n\n321\n00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:07,470\nSo yeah, you could just switch tabs there,\nit's kinda silly, and there we go.\n\n322\n00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,820\nAnd this is a domain controller, so\nI should point out as I said a minute ago,\n\n323\n00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,780\nremote assistance is not gonna be\nenabled on your domain controller, so\n\n324\n00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,370\nthat's why that one is turned off.\n\n325\n00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,490\nBut there's your default, do not, or\n\n326\n00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,070\ndon't show remote connections to\nthis computer, is that what it says?\n\n327\n00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,880\n>> Don't allow remote?\n\n328\n00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,560\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n329\n00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,240\nI was gonna say, why would it say show?\n\n330\n00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,320\n>> We need a bigger TV.\n\n331\n00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,590\n>> We do.\nWell, you know, my eyes are getting old,\n\n332\n00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,645\nI need to go get my contacts adjusted or\nsomething.\n\n333\n00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:33,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n334\n00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,850\ndon't allow remote\nconnections to this computer.\n\n335\n00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,570\n>> Right, so that's on by default.\n\n336\n00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,330\n>> That's by default.\n\n337\n00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,580\n>> That's a default setting,\nwe want to turn it on,\n\n338\n00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,200\nwe wanted to use it with a purpose\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n339\n00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,770\n>> Than having things on by, by default.\n\n340\n00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,850\n>> Yeah, if you're not gonna use print,\nyou always wanna think about hardening\n\n341\n00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,250\nyour servers and anything that you're\nnot using you would want to disable.\n\n342\n00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,620\nIf we're not using remote desktop for\n\n343\n00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,080\nremote administration, then I don't want\nthis machine sitting there listening for\n\n344\n00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,040\nremote desktop connections because\nit ain't us we're not using it.\n\n345\n00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,488\nYou want other people to be the bad guys,\n\n346\n00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:04,103\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n347\n00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:04,777\nSo\n\n348\n00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:08,447\nyeah, it's not turned on by default.\nBut it's pretty easy to turn on, right?\n\n349\n00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:09,737\nAs we saw here, we go in there,\n\n350\n00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:12,180\nselect allow remote\nconnections to this computer.\n\n351\n00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,820\n>> Yup.\n\n352\n00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,830\n>> And it's got that little\ncheck mark underneath there,\n\n353\n00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,238\nand I'll let you read that.\n\n354\n00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:17,170\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n355\n00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,190\n>> Allow connections\n\n356\n00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,740\nonly from computers running remote desktop\nwith network level authentication.\n\n357\n00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,116\n>> Network level authentication.\n\n358\n00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:26,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n359\n00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:31,260\nNow, it just means using\na newer revision or\n\n360\n00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,070\nnewer version of remote desktop, correct?\n\n361\n00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,462\n>> Yeah, and it allows for\nthat mutual authentication so\n\n362\n00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:38,755\nthat we can verify either\nend of that conversation.\n\n363\n00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:45,072\nStarted with, well, we usually skip Vista,\nwe don't really mention it much.\n\n364\n00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:47,419\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Myself wants to pretend that\n\n365\n00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,618\nthat never happened.\n\n366\n00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:52,844\nSo, I usually say Windows 7 and later but\ntruly it did come out with with Vista so\n\n367\n00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,926\nXP and prior with this option enabled,\n\n368\n00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:58,036\nI would not be able to remote\nin to this domain controller.\n\n369\n00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,693\nUsing XP or prior operating system,\n\n370\n00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,424\ncuz they don't support\nthe network level authentication.\n\n371\n00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:05,627\nAnd we could uncheck if had older machines\nthat we wanted to allow a remote in,\n\n372\n00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:06,625\nwe could uncheck that.\n\n373\n00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:12,060\nThat is gonna reduce our security\na little bit so we can enable that.\n\n374\n00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,570\n>> Yup.\n\n375\n00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,970\nAnd then we'll check our users.\n\n376\n00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,710\nNow, by default administrators\nthat have remote desktop, or\n\n377\n00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,540\nremote what did you call it,\nremote desktop login?\n\n378\n00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,740\n>> Permission to remote desktop in.\n\n379\n00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,364\nThey're actually added in Windows\noperating system, there's a local group,\n\n380\n00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:35,360\nso each Windows machine has its own local\ngroup called the Remote Desktop Users\n\n381\n00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,880\ngroup and so,\nyou could really do it either way, right.\n\n382\n00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,340\nWe could go into our computer management,\nopen up our local users and groups,\n\n383\n00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,400\nand add this to, or\nadd somebody [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n384\n00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,390\nto the remote desktop users group.\n\n385\n00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,570\nOr, by opening up this dialogue box\nanybody that we add here, that's what\n\n386\n00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,570\nit's doing in the background is adding\nthem to the remote desktop users group.\n\n387\n00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,702\nAnd as you pointed out the administrators\nanybody in the built-in administrators\n\n388\n00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:04,184\ngroup is already added,\nbecause the built-in administrators group\n\n389\n00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,930\nis a member of the remote\ndesktop users group.\n\n390\n00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,032\n>> Nice.\n\n391\n00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:10,645\nAll right, we're just gonna add a user.\n\n392\n00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,550\n>> Let's add somebody\njust to see how it works.\n\n393\n00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,090\n>> All right, so I'll add myself.\n\n394\n00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:19,280\nI created myself an account\nearlier in previous episodes.\n\n395\n00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,440\nSo there's our guy, we added him in there.\n\n396\n00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,020\nClick OK, and there we go.\n\n397\n00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,670\n>> Beautiful.\n\n398\n00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,055\n>> So Mike, so that's it, right?\n\n399\n00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:29,175\nWe're just gonna turn the thing on and\nthen log in?\n\n400\n00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,210\n>> That's it,\nit did a lot of things for us, though.\n\n401\n00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,790\nRight?\nIt did a couple of things for us,\n\n402\n00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,740\nturned on that ability to remote desktop\ninto the machine, but we also have to make\n\n403\n00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,460\nsure our firewall is set up to allow\nthat remote desktop connection, right?\n\n404\n00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,330\nTalked about firewalls in a previous\nsession or in a previous episode, but\n\n405\n00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,260\nwhat that little wizard did for\nme is it created that rule for me.\n\n406\n00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,640\nAnd went ahead and enabled it so\nwe don't have to do it as a separate step.\n\n407\n00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,250\n>> All right.\n\n408\n00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,270\n>> But\nyou could do it manually if you wanted to.\n\n409\n00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,770\n>> All right.\n\n410\n00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,420\nWe'll skip it.\n\n411\n00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,000\n>> All right.\nSo yeah,\n\n412\n00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,890\nat that point you should be good to go.\n\n413\n00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,450\n>> Right.\n\n414\n00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,970\n>> So,\nyou just need permissions to remote in and\n\n415\n00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,350\nremote desktop has to be enabled, and\nthe firewall exception has to be made.\n\n416\n00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,490\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n417\n00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,770\n>> And on the same subnet?\n\n418\n00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,250\n>> No.\n>> More or less?\n\n419\n00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,390\nNo?\n\n420\n00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,185\n>> No, as long as you can get the name\nresolution or get the IP address,\n\n421\n00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:21,857\nlittle traverse, routers.\n\n422\n00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:22,383\n>> Right on.\n\n423\n00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:24,212\n>> All right, then yeah.\n\n424\n00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:24,822\n>> Try it.\n\n425\n00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:25,345\n>> Sweet.\n\n426\n00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:27,980\n>> Sweet, so\nnow you're back on the client.\n\n427\n00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,420\nWe're gonna open up our\nremote desktop and.\n\n428\n00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,970\n>> Remote desktop, right, yeah.\n\n429\n00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,615\nRemote desktop connection right so\n\n430\n00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:44,360\nin the first field we have\nthe computer that we're going to.\n\n431\n00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,820\nThe computer's name is DCO1.\n\n432\n00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,280\n>> DCO1, so we put the name of\nthe computer and you can do name or\n\n433\n00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,686\nIP address, right.\n\n434\n00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:56,505\nMight be a situation where if you were at\nhome I might not be able to get that same\n\n435\n00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:58,850\nname resolution,\nI might need to use IP addresses or\n\n436\n00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,830\nsomething like that depending on\nhow you got your network setup.\n\n437\n00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,840\n>> So, I clicked on the show options\nbutton here, and we'll go through\n\n438\n00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,860\nthe different things on the wonderful\nstuff of remote desktop and how we can\n\n439\n00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,235\nconfigure it to I guess more tailored to\nwhat we're trying to do on the session.\n\n440\n00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:19,570\n>> Yep,\nthere's a ton of options in there, right?\n\n441\n00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,700\nOnce you click that show options,\nwe can see we have five, six tabs there.\n\n442\n00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,270\nSo, a lot of different tabs.\n\n443\n00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,050\nGot our computer name.\n\n444\n00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,760\nYou can put your username in there.\n\n445\n00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,450\nI'm not a big fan of that and\nI don't know about you?\n\n446\n00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,440\nDo you usually put your name in there and\nsave it and all that?\n\n447\n00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,180\n>> Yeah. Oh, yeah. >> Yeah?\n\n448\n00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,790\nNice.\n\n449\n00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,830\n>> All the time.\n\n450\n00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,020\n>> Here's my,\nI'll give you my two cents worth.\n\n451\n00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,540\nIf I've got my laptop and we're gonna\nsee how we can save these remote desktop\n\n452\n00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,940\nconnections to our desktop at some point,\nright?\n\n453\n00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,610\nAnd if I've got that icon sitting on\nmy desktop and I've already put in my\n\n454\n00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,890\nusername and password and\nchose to save my credentials, and\n\n455\n00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,250\nthen I walk away from my computer while\nI'm getting my refill of my frappe mocha,\n\n456\n00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,612\nwhatever they do at these Starbucks\nplaces, these coffee shops, sorry,\n\n457\n00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:01,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n458\n00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,620\n>> I probably shouldn't use those\n\n459\n00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,482\nwords\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,484\n>> I don't wanna get sued for that.\n\n461\n00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:11,072\nNow, that means if somebody grabs my\nlaptop and they double click on that icon\n\n462\n00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:15,690\nguess what, they're now connected\nback to that work server as me.\n\n463\n00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,408\nSo yeah, I'm not a big fan of saving\nmy credentials on anything and\n\n464\n00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:23,030\nnot here but for the lab, no biggie.\n\n465\n00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,113\n>> If I was at a coffee shop,\n\n466\n00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:30,410\nif I had my laptop there if I\nwalked away I'd choose to lock it.\n\n467\n00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,300\n>> Lock the screen?\n\n468\n00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, if I pick it up and\n\n469\n00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,760\nwalk away with it then all I have\nto do is break your password.\n\n470\n00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,117\nAnd knowing the way you use your password\nI mean, it's probably chicken bowl.\n\n471\n00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,380\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, all right,\n\n472\n00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,620\nwe can get into more security stuff and\nmore.\n\n473\n00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,550\n>> We'll save that for another episode.\n\n474\n00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,850\n>> The security plus right, that goes\ninto policies, procedures, right?\n\n475\n00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,440\nAll the fun stuff.\n\n476\n00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,620\n>> Yeah, we'll save that.\n\n477\n00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,390\n>> We'll save that for Nate.\n\n478\n00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,610\n>> I won't give Nate too\nhard of a time there.\n\n479\n00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,720\n[LAUGH] So we've got our username\nthat we can store in there,\n\n480\n00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,370\nwe can choose to save the credentials.\n\n481\n00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,800\nNow, wait, go back to that one,\nwe'll do the save at the end right?\n\n482\n00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,430\nOnce we get through all the other options.\n\n483\n00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,950\nYup, so display.\n\n484\n00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,450\nWhat you got there my friend?\n\n485\n00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,875\n>> All right, display tab,\nright or display configuration.\n\n486\n00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:23,040\nRight, so we can choose when\nwe remote into something\n\n487\n00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,020\nwe have it display in a window we're\ngonna have it display full screen, right.\n\n488\n00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,870\nWe can set it here.\n\n489\n00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,830\nI like to use full screen, right?\n\n490\n00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,180\n>> I do too,\nI'm a big fan of the full screen option.\n\n491\n00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,980\nYou can minimize it,\n\n492\n00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,360\nyou can bring it down from a maximized\nwindow when you get remote into there, but\n\n493\n00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,650\nit gives you that feeling that you\nare actually at that computer.\n\n494\n00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,022\nIt can get confusing sometimes\nif you've got two or\n\n495\n00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:49,300\nthree remote desktop sessions going,\nand now you've got your task bar for\n\n496\n00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,048\nthe computer you're sitting at across the\nbottom and then three individual windows.\n\n497\n00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:56,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That each have task bars on them, and\n\n498\n00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,600\nyou can click the wrong one very easily.\n\n499\n00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,590\nI have almost shut down a server\nbefore by going to the wrong,\n\n500\n00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,480\nbefore we had Windows back when\nwe used to have a start menu.\n\n501\n00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,610\nI've almost shut down a server that\nwas not even here it was in Pensacola.\n\n502\n00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,330\nAnd if I had meant to shut\ndown a different machine but\n\n503\n00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,320\nclicked the wrong Start button and\nif I had shut it down I'm\n\n504\n00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,960\neither driving out to Pensacola to turn\nthat thing back on or calling Jay, or\n\n505\n00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,828\nsomebody and say hey, can you please get\nin there and turn that server back on.\n\n506\n00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:30,980\nSo yeah, I like full screen because\nyou just see the remote desktop and\n\n507\n00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,000\nnot your desktop, but you can choose\neither, you've got that little slider.\n\n508\n00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,470\nAnd I know a lot of people with big\nmonitors prefer the dual window\n\n509\n00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,620\nbecause they can have two or three almost\nside by side and work with them that way.\n\n510\n00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,430\nSo, it really depends on your\npersonal preference there.\n\n511\n00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,420\n>> Yup, there's an option just below\nit that's grayed out right now, but\n\n512\n00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,680\nIf you have a multi-monitor setup, you can\nhave that remote desktop connection span\n\n513\n00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,670\nacross your monitors to make best use\nout of your available screen real estate\n\n514\n00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,910\n>> That’s cool isn’t it?\n\n515\n00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,540\n>> Good to have four or\nthree monitors and it would stink to\n\n516\n00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,760\nremote into something and\nhave to work than still have it on one.\n\n517\n00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,070\n>> I've got four monitors and\nhere I am trapped on this one monitor.\n\n518\n00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,840\nThat's actually new with 2012 and\nWindows 8.\n\n519\n00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,050\nI couldn't do that prior to that.\n\n520\n00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,840\nVery cool option there.\n\n521\n00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,970\n>> Now, we've got the colors down here.\n\n522\n00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,220\nWe can set our color depth.\n\n523\n00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,880\nThis is more for\nif we're having a slow connection\n\n524\n00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,010\nsomething of that nature, or\ngoing across the WAN link.\n\n525\n00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,420\nWe can tailor it and\nreduce the amount of bandwidth,\n\n526\n00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,600\nget a little bit better\nperformance out of that session.\n\n527\n00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,040\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n528\n00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,940\nWe'll leave ours on high.\n\n529\n00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,977\n>> Yeah, we got a good fast connection so\nwe can leave that there.\n\n530\n00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:49,899\n>> We've got remote audio.\n\n531\n00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:55,495\nSo this by default when you connect\ninto something, it does not.\n\n532\n00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:58,345\nRelay any of the, the system sounds.\n\n533\n00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,386\n>> Right.\n>> You can't use the microphone on it, or\n\n534\n00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:01,294\nanything like that.\n\n535\n00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:02,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n536\n00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,270\n>> We can use these options.\n\n537\n00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,490\nOh, I have this one.\n\n538\n00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,305\nIt is on.\n\n539\n00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n540\n00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,370\n>> So, yeah, we can turn whether all your\nsounds to play on the remote machine,\n\n541\n00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,275\non this machine.\n\n542\n00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:13,590\nNo sounds at all.\n\n543\n00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,000\n>> It's kind of funny,\nI almost never look at that option there.\n\n544\n00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,340\nIt does play, so if you have an error,\nyou know, that bong, or\n\n545\n00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,800\nwhatever those kind of sounds.\n\n546\n00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,890\nYou might want those to come up on\nyour speakers that you're sitting at,\n\n547\n00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,070\ninstead of in the server\ncloset where nobody is.\n\n548\n00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,540\nWell, there's not even\nspeakers hooked up in there.\n\n549\n00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,860\nI have tried, I don't know if you've done\nthis, I have tried to remote desktop\n\n550\n00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,070\ninto my computer at home from work,\ncuz I've got all my MP3s at home, right?\n\n551\n00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,657\nSo I thought, hey, I'm gonna play\non this computer, I'll go fire-up\n\n552\n00:24:41,657 --> 00:24:46,190\na media player in there, and\nstream my music back, yeah, not so much.\n\n553\n00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,920\nIt was pretty bad,\nthis was a few years ago, so maybe my ISP\n\n554\n00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,660\nhas since upgraded their lines and stuff.\n\n555\n00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,100\nI've got a much faster connection now so\nmaybe I should try it again.\n\n556\n00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,575\nBut I will say it really\nisn't designed for that.\n\n557\n00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:04,840\n[LAUGH]\n>> We've got keyboard commands here.\n\n558\n00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,905\nRight, this is pretty neat.\n\n559\n00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:11,920\nNow when you remote into something and\nyou've smashed the Windows key,\n\n560\n00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,260\nI'm getting used to it,\nWindows key accidents, whatever,.\n\n561\n00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,890\nAnd whether or not those keys\nwill execute on local machine or\n\n562\n00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,310\non the a remote machine.\n\n563\n00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,140\nI like the default right here\nonly when it's in full screen so\n\n564\n00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,000\nwhen it does pull up, it's like you're\nsitting on it and then you can,\n\n565\n00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,960\nyou know, ALT tab and everything and\nit will execute on the remote machine.\n\n566\n00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,800\n>> That's a very nice feature there.\n\n567\n00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,980\nEspecially with Windows 8\nbecause as you were saying,\n\n568\n00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,530\nthe keyboard shortcuts are much\nmore important in Windows 8.\n\n569\n00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,050\nBeing able to flip back and\nforth between the new interface and\n\n570\n00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,660\nthe desktop view, nice to be able\nto throw those keyboard shortcuts\n\n571\n00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,240\ninto your remote desktop session.\n\n572\n00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,950\n>> Yep.\n\n573\n00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,460\nWe've got local devices and\nresources down there.\n\n574\n00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,020\nThings like printers, clipboard,\nwe'll click on them more.\n\n575\n00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,395\n>> Yeah and these are some really\ncool options here, aren't they?\n\n576\n00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:05,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n577\n00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,650\nYep, ports, drivers, other sort of plug\nand play things so things that we have\n\n578\n00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,690\nconnected locally, right,\nwill be available on the remote machines.\n\n579\n00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,170\nLike here I'll click cancel,\nall right, printers.\n\n580\n00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,490\nSo if I remoted into something,\nright and I'm accessing a document,\n\n581\n00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,920\nand I want to print it.\n\n582\n00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,510\nWell, it wouldn't make much sense\nto print it where that machine is-\n\n583\n00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,100\n>> Where the remote computer is, yeah.\n\n584\n00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,500\n>> So we have this option\nhere to make the printer,\n\n585\n00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,010\nthat I have locally, available on\nthe printer that I remoted into.\n\n586\n00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,120\nSo I can print locally\nfrom a remote machine.\n\n587\n00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,170\nPretty sure.\n\n588\n00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,280\n>> It just makes sense right.\n\n589\n00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,800\nIts just like light, you gotta have that.\n\n590\n00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,450\nClipboard is another one\nyou can bring with you.\n\n591\n00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,260\nYou're basically deciding what\ndo I want to bring with me\n\n592\n00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,940\nin this remote desktop connection.\n\n593\n00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,090\nNow if you go back into the Moor, I think\nsome of those options are fantastic.\n\n594\n00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,310\nBecause if you expand our drives there.\n\n595\n00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:04,340\nBut, you know, when you connect to that\nremote machine, you can't just copy\n\n596\n00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,410\na file, you can't drag a file from the\ndesktop of that remote desktop session and\n\n597\n00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,850\ndrop it on your local desktop, right?\n\n598\n00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,860\nYou can't copy files back and\nforth that way.\n\n599\n00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,700\nSo how do I, if I remote into that\nserver that's over there in Pensacola,\n\n600\n00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,150\nhow do I copy one of those\nfiles to my local machine?\n\n601\n00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:27,780\nWell, here I can bring my drives with me,\nso when I get into that remote machine and\n\n602\n00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,720\nI open up Windows Explorer\non the remote machine,\n\n603\n00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,990\nI will see mapped network drives back\nto my computer that I'm sitting at.\n\n604\n00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,880\nSo now I can just copy files\nright to the those map drives.\n\n605\n00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,860\nYou've got the option of bringing\nyour USB, your thumb drive.\n\n606\n00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,560\nIf you expand that one out down there,\nall of your plug and\n\n607\n00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,280\nplay devices,\nthey don't have to be plugged in, right?\n\n608\n00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,470\nIf I'm sitting there and I'm remoted\ninto the server and I go, oh, I need to\n\n609\n00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,490\nget a copy of that, take my thumb drive,\nslap it into my local computer.\n\n610\n00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,800\nAnd it's going to see it on that remote\nmachine and go, hey you got a new drive,\n\n611\n00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800\nwhat do you want to do with this?\n\n612\n00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,070\nYou know that whole Windows thing.\n\n613\n00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,250\nLove these, love those options.\n\n614\n00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,480\nWhen you do select these\noptions you'll get a warning\n\n615\n00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,200\nwhen you connect to that remote machine,\ncuz it is a security risk, right?\n\n616\n00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,660\nSo it's gonna prompt you, it's gonna say,\n\n617\n00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,970\nhey are you sure you want to\nbring your drives with you?\n\n618\n00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,510\nOr whatever you're choosing\nto bring with you.\n\n619\n00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,250\n>> Right, let's do that,\nover here and drive with us.\n\n620\n00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:21,840\n>> Bring them all.\n\n621\n00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,560\nWhat the heck.\n\n622\n00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,090\n>> Yep.\n>> I mean,\n\n623\n00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,770\nyou can even bring your CD-ROM drive,\nor your DVD drive, right?\n\n624\n00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,320\nSo if I wanted to throw in a, let's say\nI wanted to install the steam engine on\n\n625\n00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,870\na remote machine,\nwe could throw that DVD in there or\n\n626\n00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,570\nsomething, and\nhave access to it on the remote machine.\n\n627\n00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,190\n>> Yeah, so, wow, we could install\nit on all the servers, right?\n\n628\n00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,900\n>> Exactly.\n\n629\n00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,450\nThen we have LAN parties\ntill the cows come home.\n\n630\n00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,136\n>> We should do that.\n\n631\n00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:48,169\n>> Did I just say that?\n\n632\n00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:53,890\n[LAUGH]\n>> We've got programs right?\n\n633\n00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,540\nYeah, we're getting\na little tight on there.\n\n634\n00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,410\n>> Yeah,\nhonestly I never used this option.\n\n635\n00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,310\nWhat if you put a program in there\nlike let’s say, you type in calc.exe.\n\n636\n00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,960\nWhen you remote into the machine,\n\n637\n00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,630\ninstead of seeing the entire\ndesktop all you see is calc.exe.\n\n638\n00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,230\nIt’s calc running on that remote machine.\n\n639\n00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,690\nIt’s very similar to something\nlike terminal services.\n\n640\n00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:21,144\nI rarely use that so\nI would not select that one.\n\n641\n00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:27,720\n>> All right, on this experience tab\nwe can set the speed that we have.\n\n642\n00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,800\nRight, I know kind of configure\nitself based on that speed.\n\n643\n00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,885\nI have default setting,\ndetect connection quality automatically.\n\n644\n00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:36,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n645\n00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,010\n>> Yeah, depending on how good the\nconnection is, if it's a poor connection,\n\n646\n00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,980\nit will automatically\nturn off some things.\n\n647\n00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,170\nLike Windows 7 had the arrow interface\nwith the cool glass-like things.\n\n648\n00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:51,480\nIt will turn that stuff off to improve\nthe responsiveness of that remote machine.\n\n649\n00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,038\n>> Yeah and\n\n650\n00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:57,380\nthe important thing to note there is just\nthat if you hit that drop-down list and\n\n651\n00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,182\nyou choose something like low speed\nbandwidth 250 to 2 megabytes.\n\n652\n00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:06,160\nThat's not going to limit your\nconnection to two megabits per second.\n\n653\n00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,870\nRight.\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n654\n00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,100\n>> It's not changing the actual\nspeed of your connection.\n\n655\n00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,960\nAll it's doing is saying is all right,\n\n656\n00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,770\nif you're going that slow,\nlet's not bring font smoothing.\n\n657\n00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,790\nLet's not do the Window's\ncontent while dragging.\n\n658\n00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,890\nThat's all it's doing is turning off some\nof those things that are gonna slow your\n\n659\n00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,840\nconnection down.\n\n660\n00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,715\nIt's saying hey look,\nyour connection is already slow enough.\n\n661\n00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:27,360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's just leave all this off here.\n\n662\n00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,560\nBut the automatically detect,\nI have had real good luck with it,\n\n663\n00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,410\nit seems to pick it up pretty well.\n\n664\n00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,235\n>> The last one here, right?\n\n665\n00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:36,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n666\n00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,860\n>> The authentication, right?\n\n667\n00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,855\nSo, we'll see this when we\ngo to connect to it, right?\n\n668\n00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:42,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n669\n00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,380\n>> We'll get a little yellow box\npopping up, right, stuff, whatnot.\n\n670\n00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,120\n>> Yeah, and you can say there, you can\nsay to warn me if it doesn't support the,\n\n671\n00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,320\nwhat is that phrase?\n\n672\n00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,630\nWhat is it, if it doesn't support\nthe network level authentication?\n\n673\n00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,120\n>> Don't connect warn.\n\n674\n00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,230\nConnect and don't warn.\n\n675\n00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,730\n>> Yep.\n\n676\n00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,470\nSo if the other end didn't support it and\n\n677\n00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,230\nyou said don't connect then it\njust wouldn't connect at all.\n\n678\n00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,730\nIt could give you a warning so\nthat you have to click yes or no.\n\n679\n00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,490\nOr it could just connect anyway,\nwho cares?\n\n680\n00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,470\nSo whatever you wanna choose there.\n\n681\n00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,270\nAnd in that bottom one,\nwe probably cover that in another session.\n\n682\n00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,490\nI don't know if we're\ngonna get into that here.\n\n683\n00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,520\nBut that's for\na terminal services gateway or\n\n684\n00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,220\nremote desktop gateway as they want\nto call it now for remoting in from.\n\n685\n00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,280\nIf I’m at home and I want to remote into\nmy computer at work, the first screen\n\n686\n00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,070\nthat we saw in that general tab, I’ve got\nto put in the name or the IP address.\n\n687\n00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,510\nWell, my computer at work has a private\nIP address, can't very well type in\n\n688\n00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,770\na private IP address from home and\nexpect to connect to.\n\n689\n00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,510\nSo we set up on our corporate network,\n\n690\n00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,695\nwe have a remote desktop gateway that\nkind of accesses the connection point.\n\n691\n00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,365\nBecause it's exposed to the Internet,\nI can connect to that.\n\n692\n00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:53,493\nAnd then it will redirect me to\nthe appropriate private IP address.\n\n693\n00:31:53,493 --> 00:31:54,156\n>> Right on, yep.\n\n694\n00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:55,027\nThose are those tabs.\n\n695\n00:31:55,027 --> 00:32:00,170\nYep, we're right up on break so\nwhat we're going to do is Save that guy.\n\n696\n00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,837\nWe'll see, we'll save it and\nwe'll dump it onto the desktop.\n\n697\n00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:08,400\nWe'll just call it something, ASDF.\n\n698\n00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,880\n>> You know,\nwe can take a look at it for you.\n\n699\n00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,026\nWe can take a look at it when we get back.\n\n700\n00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:14,149\nBut I create those for\n\n701\n00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:17,840\neach one of the computers that I\nremote into on a regular basis.\n\n702\n00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,220\nAnd then I just name it whatever\nthe name of that computer is.\n\n703\n00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,010\nSo, if I double-click on DC01, that's\nmy remote desktop connection to DC01.\n\n704\n00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,100\nAnd it's nice to be able to save those,\n\n705\n00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,145\nbecause I don't have to reconfigure\nall those tabs each time.\n\n706\n00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:32,720\n>> Mm-hm, it's convenient.\n\n707\n00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,500\n>> Yeah, very handy.\n>> All right,\n\n708\n00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,024\nwell we'll fire it up after the break.\n\n709\n00:32:35,024 --> 00:32:35,825\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n710\n00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:37,054\n>> And we'll get connected, all right?\n\n711\n00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:38,284\nSee you back in just a minute.\n\n712\n00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:45,898\n[SOUND].\n\n713\n00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:47,204\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n714\n00:32:47,204 --> 00:32:49,142\nwelcome back\n>> All right,\n\n715\n00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:52,645\nso we'll continue on with remote desktop.\n\n716\n00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:53,615\n>> Yeah, yup.\n\n717\n00:32:53,615 --> 00:32:55,340\n>> And we saved our configuration.\n\n718\n00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,545\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And yeah, let's fire up and\n\n719\n00:32:57,545 --> 00:33:00,095\nwe'll start the thing going?\n\n720\n00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:00,866\n>> Sounds like a plan to me.\n\n721\n00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:03,068\n>> Word, send, yep.\n\n722\n00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,999\n[LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, in that last session, or\n\n723\n00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:09,201\nthat last episode we created\nour remote desktop session, or\n\n724\n00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:12,300\nwe configured our remote desktop\noptions and we saved it.\n\n725\n00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,875\nYou saved it what, to your desktop there?\n\n726\n00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,070\n>> Mm-hm, I think so.\n\n727\n00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,570\n>> Yep, let's see,\nlet me get back into that machine there.\n\n728\n00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:26,002\nAnd so we saved it, and I just creatively\nit what Mike always uses, ASDF.\n\n729\n00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:27,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's right there.\n\n730\n00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,754\nSo we'll go ahead and close it out.\n\n731\n00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:32,512\n>> Now, I will tell you one thing\nthat we should probably point out.\n\n732\n00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,760\nI don't know,\nI didn't watch you when you saved this.\n\n733\n00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,200\nDid you click Save or Save As?\n\n734\n00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,780\n>> Save As.\n\n735\n00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,740\n>> Okay, very good.\n\n736\n00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:43,129\nIf you click Save, you're gonna overwrite\nyour default RDP connection object, right?\n\n737\n00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:43,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n738\n00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,126\n>> So that every time you open up RDP,\n\n739\n00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:48,280\nit's all ready gonna have all\nthose settings filled in.\n\n740\n00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,273\nIf you do Save As, you can give each one\na different name as I was saying, and\n\n741\n00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:57,020\nyou could, but you did,\nyou're too smart for that so.\n\n742\n00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,961\n>> [LAUGH].\nI actually clicked Save first but\n\n743\n00:33:58,961 --> 00:34:00,155\nthen nothing happened.\n\n744\n00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:01,822\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I was like well,\n\n745\n00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,079\nlet me click Save as.\n\n746\n00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,710\nOh, there's the little box.\n\n747\n00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,461\n>> So now, what?\n\n748\n00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,898\nYou just launch MSTSC, and\nit comes up with all those settings, and\n\n749\n00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:09,750\nit's all good.\n\n750\n00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,480\n>> So it did save?\n[LAUGH]\n\n751\n00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:12,990\n>> Yep, so\n\n752\n00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,670\nall those settings are already\nconfigured into your default connection.\n\n753\n00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,330\n>> Well, good thing-\n>> Which,\n\n754\n00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,900\nif that's a computer you connect to\nall the time, then perfect, right?\n\n755\n00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,480\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n756\n00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,240\n>> Perfect.\n\n757\n00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,240\n>> Well, I mean, we chose the default for\nmost of the stuff anyhow.\n\n758\n00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,060\n>> Yeah, we did, we did.\n\n759\n00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,080\n>> All right, right on.\n\n760\n00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,810\nSo what we're going to do, so\nthere's our little thing, right there.\n\n761\n00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,245\nAnd we just double click on it, and\nwe are prompted with this guy, right?\n\n762\n00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:32,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n763\n00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,075\n>> This remote connection could\nharm your local computer,\n\n764\n00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:39,420\ncuz we're remoting into something,\nand we're sharing out our drive.\n\n765\n00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,319\n>> Right.\n>> And they're gonna be connected more or\n\n766\n00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:43,370\nless and so-\n>> Yeah.\n\n767\n00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,963\nSo that remote computer now\nhas access to your drives.\n\n768\n00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:49,320\nSo we gotta make sure we trust\nthe computer we're remoting into.\n\n769\n00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,074\nAnd so this warning us there, and\nit also gives me the option to,\n\n770\n00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:53,500\ndon't ask me again, please.\n\n771\n00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,570\n>> Yeah, I like that.\n\n772\n00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,020\n>> Yes, [LAUGH] because if you're remoting\ninto the same computer every day, or\n\n773\n00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,330\nmore than one time a day, you get tired\nof that dialogue box popping up there.\n\n774\n00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,660\n>> Mm-hm, it's another click, right?\n\n775\n00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,510\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n>> I mean, we'll just turn it off.\n\n776\n00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,290\n>> Yup.\n\n777\n00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,020\n>> All right so, we go though,\nit finds a computer, right?\n\n778\n00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,200\nSo it's establishing that connection and\nthen now we have to authenticate.\n\n779\n00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,941\nAnd I did add myself onto the users\nthat's allowed to connect.\n\n780\n00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:17,580\nSo I'll type in my password.\n\n781\n00:35:20,482 --> 00:35:22,040\nAll right, and so\nnow we've got this, right?\n\n782\n00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,790\nThis authentication deal, right?\n\n783\n00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,969\n>> Yep.\n>> We've got, so, a certificate name,\n\n784\n00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:31,960\nthe computer that we are connecting to,\nand some other good stuff.\n\n785\n00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,079\n>> Yeah, and in this case,\nif you click View Certificate down there,\n\n786\n00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,880\nwe'll see that we're connecting to DC01,\nbut it's a self-signed certificate, right?\n\n787\n00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,405\nIn our test environment, we don't have\na certificate authority that's issued out\n\n788\n00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:47,600\ncertificates, and\nwe're set up to trust the root.\n\n789\n00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,295\nThat's a completely different episode.\n\n790\n00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:50,612\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I look forward to that one,\n\n791\n00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:52,500\nI love some certificate services.\n\n792\n00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,150\nBut in this case, it's a self-signed\ncertificate so it's warning me,\n\n793\n00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,160\nhey, I don't trust the certificate.\n\n794\n00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,670\nAre you sure you want to\nconnect to this machine?\n\n795\n00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,100\nAnd if you know the machine,\nas we do, then yeah, you're fine.\n\n796\n00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,220\n>> I've got an Install button.\n\n797\n00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,080\n>> You could install the certificate.\n\n798\n00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,420\nSometimes, it'll give you\na little bit of an issue there.\n\n799\n00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,864\nI will tell you honestly that I\ndon't know if you wanna try or not.\n\n800\n00:36:14,864 --> 00:36:17,030\nWe're probably not gonna go back and\ndo connection again.\n\n801\n00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,167\nI will tell you,\n\n802\n00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:23,132\na lot of times I have trouble installing\nit from this particular screen.\n\n803\n00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:26,763\nSometimes it just does not seem to work\nproperly, but you definitely could.\n\n804\n00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:29,750\nRight there we go.\n\n805\n00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,090\nYeah, if we trust the computer,\nwe just say don't show it for\n\n806\n00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,070\nthis connection every time,\nand we're good to go.\n\n807\n00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:38,225\n>> All right, there it goes,\nit is connecting out.\n\n808\n00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:39,616\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n809\n00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:40,193\n>> There we go.\n\n810\n00:36:40,193 --> 00:36:46,039\nSo, we are running,\nwe're using our client computer and\n\n811\n00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:52,600\nwe are remoting, using Remote Desktop\nto go into our server and so\n\n812\n00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,990\nit's got the real nice\ndefault resolution of giant.\n\n813\n00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,621\n>> Of giant, yeah.\n\n814\n00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:00,470\nIt's a little bit smaller there, but-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n815\n00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,690\n>> Good old server manager.\n\n816\n00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,890\nBut, yeah, so\nnow you're looking at the desktop for\n\n817\n00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,982\nyour server that might not even\nbe in the same country as you.\n\n818\n00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:10,184\nRight, or it could be sitting in the\nserver closet here, in another city, or\n\n819\n00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:10,740\nwhatever.\n\n820\n00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,533\nI got that handy little bar up\nacross the top where you could-\n\n821\n00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,989\n>> Go ahead and let's restore it down.\n\n822\n00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:19,850\nDo a little restore down\non it to show them.\n\n823\n00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,500\nAnd now you can kinda move that window.\n\n824\n00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,275\nIt's awfully, it's still, again,\nthe resolution's a little bit big, but.\n\n825\n00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:25,870\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n826\n00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,350\n>> There you go.\nSo now you're seeing that we are still on\n\n827\n00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,590\nour Windows 8 machine.\n\n828\n00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:34,585\nYet in this window,\nI have the desktop of this remote machine.\n\n829\n00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n830\n00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,060\n>> Pretty darn cool, right?\n\n831\n00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,011\n>> Yep, yeah, it is cool.\n\n832\n00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:39,540\nYou know, we are using Hyper-V.\n\n833\n00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,762\nI mean, some of the stuff that\nwe do on these computers,\n\n834\n00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:46,827\nit'll mess up the one that we're\nrunning to stream this connection.\n\n835\n00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:51,230\nWe can see that we're on my computer,\nright, that I use.\n\n836\n00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,908\n>> Using a virtual machine that\nis now remoted into our, I mean,\n\n837\n00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:56,190\nthat's cool stuff.\n\n838\n00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,160\n>> Oh yeah, it's fantastic.\n\n839\n00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,050\nI don't know if everybody\nat home can catch that.\n\n840\n00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:04,260\nSo he's actually got the Windows operating\nsystem, Windows 8 installed on his laptop.\n\n841\n00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,410\nAnd on top of that, he's running a virtual\nmachine that's running WIndows 8.\n\n842\n00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:13,216\nAnd then from that virtual machine he’s\nremoted into another virtual machine\n\n843\n00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:15,409\nthat’s running Server 2012.\n\n844\n00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:21,994\nBut we’ll talk about Hyper-V in\nanother episode as well, right?\n\n845\n00:38:21,994 --> 00:38:22,678\n>> Hm-mm, yep, yep.\n\n846\n00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:25,656\nAll right so, yeah I chose to unpin that.\n\n847\n00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:27,488\nI guess it should, there it goes\n>> Yeah.\n\n848\n00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:30,547\n>> All right, so\nhere we go into our server, or\n\n849\n00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:35,842\nwhatever machine that we need to manage,\nor click on, or do whatever we need\n\n850\n00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:41,290\nto without having to get up and pause\nthe game, and go over there to do it.\n\n851\n00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,100\n>> One more thing we probably\nshould show them while we're here.\n\n852\n00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,598\nLet's go ahead and launch say, Notepad.\n\n853\n00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:46,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n854\n00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,830\n>> Let's get that Notepad going up there.\n\n855\n00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,440\nCuz one of the things you gotta be real\ncareful with about Remote Desktop,\n\n856\n00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,530\nif you were to go up there and\nclick on that X and\n\n857\n00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:58,670\njust close that window, exactly,\nclose your Remote Desktop window.\n\n858\n00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,528\nIt warns you, which is nice,\nit didn't used to warn you.\n\n859\n00:39:01,528 --> 00:39:04,490\nAnd I don't know what\nthat warning said now.\n\n860\n00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n861\n00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,935\nbasically what it's telling\nyou is by closing that window,\n\n862\n00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:12,180\nyou're disconnecting your session,\nyou are not logging off from that machine.\n\n863\n00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,871\nSo if you go and remote back into it,\nwe should see that we'll just reconnect to\n\n864\n00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:21,014\nthat same session, and Notepad\nshould still be open on our desktop.\n\n865\n00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:23,893\n>> Hm.\n>> All right, so\n\n866\n00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:25,910\nyou're reconnecting back to that session.\n\n867\n00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,930\nNow with Remote Desktop,\nas far as the client operating systems go,\n\n868\n00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,250\nyou're allowed one Remote Desktop session,\nright?\n\n869\n00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,930\nSo if I'm sitting at my\nWindows 8 machine and\n\n870\n00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,185\nsomebody tries to remote\ninto that Windows 8 machine,\n\n871\n00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:40,110\nthen it's gonna have to kick me off\nto allow them to Remote Desktop.\n\n872\n00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,293\nAnd I'm gonna see a locked screen,\n\n873\n00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:43,749\nthe computer's gonna look like it's\nlocked while they're remoted in.\n\n874\n00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,621\nSo only one person can\nhave that console or\n\n875\n00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:47,558\ninteractive session going on at one time.\n\n876\n00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:52,591\nServer operating systems on the other\nhand, give me two remote desktop sessions.\n\n877\n00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,802\nWithout the need for\nany additional licenses.\n\n878\n00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:59,324\nSo two administrators could be remoted\ninto that same server at the same time.\n\n879\n00:39:59,324 --> 00:40:01,319\nAs well as somebody\nbeing in the closet and\n\n880\n00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:03,608\nlogged on with a console\nsession there really.\n\n881\n00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:08,323\nAnd the reason I point it out is\nit's real easy to close that window,\n\n882\n00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,657\nwhich leaves your session open.\n\n883\n00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:14,260\nWell, that's tying up one of\nthose remote desktop sessions.\n\n884\n00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,620\nAnd if one other administrator does that,\nlogs, remotes in, closes the window,\n\n885\n00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,330\nand leaves that session open,\n\n886\n00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:24,220\nthat third administrator goes to\nremote into the machine and can't.\n\n887\n00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,760\nBecause it's going to tell him\nthat all the sessions are taken.\n\n888\n00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,500\nAnd I've had that happen to me where I'm\nworking at a night shift at this company\n\n889\n00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,640\nand during the day two\nadmins had done that.\n\n890\n00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,270\nI'm there at night and I was relatively\nnew at the company at this time, so\n\n891\n00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,120\nI didn't have a key to the server closet.\n\n892\n00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,110\nAnd, I needed to remote into that\nserver to set up a class and\n\n893\n00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,200\nit was telling me that there\nwere no sessions available.\n\n894\n00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,320\nI could not get physical access to\nthe machine to disconnect those sessions.\n\n895\n00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,330\nSo, I was kinda SOL,\nthere was nothing I could do.\n\n896\n00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:55,640\nSo, always wanna remember to log\noff of your remote desktop session,\n\n897\n00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,290\nnot just close the window.\n\n898\n00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,770\nUnless you're doing something\nthat needs to continue running.\n\n899\n00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:04,160\nLike if I remote in and\nstart up disk defrag, right?\n\n900\n00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,120\nI can close my session.\n\n901\n00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,170\nJust close the window and\ndisk defrag with continue to run, but\n\n902\n00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,199\nI am tying up that one session.\n\n903\n00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,102\n>> So [COUGH] what were you\nwanting to do on that server?\n\n904\n00:41:14,102 --> 00:41:17,448\nLike [CROSSTALK]\n>> In this case, this is when I was\n\n905\n00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:22,309\nteaching and I needed to turn off\nDHCP on that server in the closet.\n\n906\n00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,942\nBecause I was running DHCP for a separate\ndomain in my class environment and\n\n907\n00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,623\nwe're getting a conflict there.\n\n908\n00:41:27,623 --> 00:41:32,394\n>> So why don't you just use\nRemote Server Administration Toolkit and\n\n909\n00:41:32,394 --> 00:41:35,330\njust use your RSAT tools, rather than?\n\n910\n00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,881\n>> Because I was dumb.\n\n911\n00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:40,358\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> [LAUGH] I am just giving you a hard\n\n912\n00:41:40,358 --> 00:41:42,470\ntime, I was trying to call you out.\n\n913\n00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,510\n>> This was years ago too,\nwe didn't have PowerShell and\n\n914\n00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,954\nwe didn't have a lot of that stuff\n>> We did have RSAT back then, but\n\n915\n00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:51,031\nI wasn't aware of that at the time.\n\n916\n00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:51,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n917\n00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,812\n>> Right on, good deal.\n\n918\n00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:56,720\nAll right, jumping back onto\nour remote desktop stuff.\n\n919\n00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,994\nSome of the neat little\nthings I want to point out,\n\n920\n00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:00,737\nwe've got this little arrow up here.\n\n921\n00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:03,117\nClick on this little arrow,\n\n922\n00:42:03,117 --> 00:42:08,483\nit gives us some commands unique\nto Windows 8 Server 2012.\n\n923\n00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:13,184\nThings like the Charms bar, Snap,\nRights, Switch Apps, the Start.\n\n924\n00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:20,121\nSometimes, it'll be a little difficult to\ntry to get the mouse into hot corners.\n\n925\n00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,263\nAnd you can't really swipe, and what not,\nif you don't have a touch screen,\n\n926\n00:42:23,263 --> 00:42:24,034\nthat kinda thing.\n\n927\n00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:28,480\nSo I've got that for\nthose neat little commands.\n\n928\n00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,630\n>> Yeah, it really can be trouble trying\nto get down to that bottom right corner or\n\n929\n00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,060\nthat bottom left corner to bring up\nthat search banner or something.\n\n930\n00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,980\nNice that those are there.\n\n931\n00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,373\n>> It works, we've remoted into it now.\n\n932\n00:42:41,373 --> 00:42:44,770\nIt uses the default port which is 3389.\n\n933\n00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:50,550\nLets say for some reason we want\nto change that default port.\n\n934\n00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,950\n>> Right.\n>> It is possible, I've need to use it for\n\n935\n00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,450\na couple of things.\n\n936\n00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,880\nSo at my house, right?\n\n937\n00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,700\nI have some computers at the house and\nto remote into those guys,\n\n938\n00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,280\nI don't have any kinda gateway or\nwhat not.\n\n939\n00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,660\nAnd I want to remote\ninto different things and\n\n940\n00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:11,300\nall that sort, when I am away,\nI want to remote into this machine.\n\n941\n00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,640\nSo I can change the default port.\n\n942\n00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,170\nAnd, that way when I go into the firewall,\n\n943\n00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,650\nit redirects me to the correct\ncomputer I'm wanting to get after.\n\n944\n00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,430\n>> Right, if they're always in 3339,\n\n945\n00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,490\nthere's no way to set up a port\nforwarding rule to a particular machine.\n\n946\n00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,690\nSo use a different port number for\neach machine and\n\n947\n00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:32,080\nwhen you do your RDP connection,\nvery clever.\n\n948\n00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:37,120\n>> Yeah, it might be a little hack way to\ngo about doing it, but it could be useful.\n\n949\n00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,520\n>> Absolutely,\nthat's a perfect reason to use it and\n\n950\n00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,880\nthe other thing would be just\nto hardening in general, right?\n\n951\n00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,500\nWhen we talk about insecurity plus or\n\n952\n00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,830\nin our security sessions when\nwe talk about hardening servers.\n\n953\n00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,296\nWe will be talking about removing the\ndefault configuration because everybody\n\n954\n00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,269\nknows that Remote Desktop is port 3389.\n\n955\n00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:55,865\nWell, if you didn't, you know now.\n\n956\n00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:58,679\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remote Desktop uses port 3389 by\n\n957\n00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:02,540\ndefault, which means everybody\nthat's out there knows that.\n\n958\n00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,130\nAnd if we change that to something else,\nthen it's gonna make it more difficult for\n\n959\n00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,670\nthem to attempt to access my machine.\n\n960\n00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,530\nSo how do we do that?\n\n961\n00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,870\nHow can we change the default port,\ncuz I didn't see any options in our\n\n962\n00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,252\nRemote Desktop Connection dialog\nthat would allow me to do that.\n\n963\n00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:16,820\n>> No, no, no.\nSo\n\n964\n00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,620\nwe gotta get into the registry to do it.\n\n965\n00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,090\nWhat I'm gonna do, I'm gonna log\noff this remote desktop session so\n\n966\n00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,740\nwe don't have to mess around\nwith that resolution.\n\n967\n00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,460\nSo we'll, we'll sign out.\n\n968\n00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,089\nOh, and there's our client.\n\n969\n00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,789\nYou might want to pin that back.\n\n970\n00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:37,939\nNow as I jump back to server.\n\n971\n00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:41,730\nAll right now, to change the default port,\nright, its a register setting.\n\n972\n00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,790\n>> Gotcha\n>> First things, first,\n\n973\n00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,410\nwe'll get into our reg edit.\n\n974\n00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,900\n>> Ooh, you're editing the registry,\ndangerous stuff here, right?\n\n975\n00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,606\n>> Oh, that's, yeah.\n\n976\n00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:57,780\nWell, it's not dangerous if\nyou know what you're doing.\n\n977\n00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,100\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n978\n00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,530\nThat always makes me laugh when they\nsay don't mess with the registry.\n\n979\n00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,450\nAnd you really can, you can hose your\ncomputer completely getting in here and\n\n980\n00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,350\nmessing with it.\n\n981\n00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,600\nYou still should get in there and explore.\n\n982\n00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,065\nJust don't change anything.\n\n983\n00:45:12,065 --> 00:45:13,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or make a back-up of it first, so\n\n984\n00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,210\nif you do, you can always restore it.\n\n985\n00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:19,790\nSo, what Nate's gonna do there is,\nhe's gonna navigate into HP local machine\n\n986\n00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:26,022\nsystem > the current control set\n> control > terminal server.\n\n987\n00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,164\nWin stations, I think, are RDP-Tcp.\n\n988\n00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:38,565\n>> And\nthese are the settings related to that and\n\n989\n00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:44,640\nthe one we are after\nis called port number.\n\n990\n00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,810\n>> All right, so there's a port number.\n\n991\n00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,830\nDouble-click on that guy and so the first\nthing that we see is a hex number.\n\n992\n00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,640\nWe can click on it to decimal and\nthere we go.\n\n993\n00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,156\n>> Nice.\n\n994\n00:45:54,156 --> 00:45:58,790\n>> So let's change it to,\nhow about, 38389?\n\n995\n00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,050\n>> I like it, way up there so\n\n996\n00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,300\nwe know that port’s not being used by\nsome other program or anything like that.\n\n997\n00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:04,800\n>> Easy to remember\n>> Easy to remember\n\n998\n00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,590\n>> Change that guy and there we go.\n\n999\n00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,867\nThere’s no saving it in the registry,\n\n1000\n00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:13,160\nonce we make it, it’s done.\n\n1001\n00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,880\nAll right, so there’s that, it's changed.\n\n1002\n00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,630\nNow if we just, we'll have to reboot\nthe server for it to change over.\n\n1003\n00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:26,580\nBut before we do that, since we've\nchanged the port, we have to go\n\n1004\n00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,540\ninto our firewall and add a rule to let\nthis port open so we can get through it.\n\n1005\n00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,688\n>> Cuz when we enable the remote desktop,\n\n1006\n00:46:33,688 --> 00:46:37,801\nit configured the default firewall\nrule for remote desktop and 3389.\n\n1007\n00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:44,267\nDoesn't know about his custom 3, 3,\n3, 3, 8, 9, wait how many threes?\n\n1008\n00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:46,543\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think we had one.\n\n1009\n00:46:46,543 --> 00:46:47,920\n>> Just kidding.\n\n1010\n00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,810\n>> Now fortunately, right,\nwe know all about WIndows Firewall.\n\n1011\n00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,820\n>> Yeah, if you guys watched our last\nsession with the Windows Firewall,\n\n1012\n00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,080\nyou should be very familiar with this, so\n\n1013\n00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,370\nhe's going to go right in there,\ncreate a new rule.\n\n1014\n00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:03,535\nWe're gonna do it by\nport is what we're after.\n\n1015\n00:47:03,535 --> 00:47:08,606\nTCP and\nthe port we wanna open up is 33389.\n\n1016\n00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:09,605\nThere's that port.\n\n1017\n00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:10,539\nWe'll click on Next.\n\n1018\n00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:15,129\nWe're going to allow the connection,\nand we'll just do it for\n\n1019\n00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:18,853\nall the other ones to avoid\nany strange things, and\n\n1020\n00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:22,620\nwe're just going to\ncall this new RDP port.\n\n1021\n00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,120\n>> Woo-hoo.\n\n1022\n00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,080\n>> Finish.\nAll right, up there at the top,\n\n1023\n00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,290\nthat's our new firewall rule.\n\n1024\n00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:31,360\nAllowing the traffic, and\nwe are going to reboot this guy.\n\n1025\n00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,296\nWhen it turns back on, we'll retry\nthat connection on the new port.\n\n1026\n00:47:38,557 --> 00:47:39,800\nIt'll go from there.\n\n1027\n00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,510\n>> Cool beans.\n>> Yep, now while this guy boots up,\n\n1028\n00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:47,277\nthe next thing, so that's remote\nmanaging using a It's remoting in,\n\n1029\n00:47:47,277 --> 00:47:49,038\nright, Remote Desktop.\n\n1030\n00:47:49,038 --> 00:47:51,854\n>> Yeah, and we use it as\na remote management tool, I mean,\n\n1031\n00:47:51,854 --> 00:47:53,749\nthat's what our show is about today.\n\n1032\n00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:58,012\nThe one thing about when we talk about\nwhy you'd pick one tool over the other,\n\n1033\n00:47:58,012 --> 00:48:02,750\nthing to keep in mind with Remote Desktop\nis, that's a lot of permissions, right?\n\n1034\n00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,690\nIf I let somebody remote into the server,\n\n1035\n00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:10,270\nthey've got access to the entire desktop,\nwhich might not be what I'm trying to do.\n\n1036\n00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,410\nIf I want them to be able to\nadminister just a particular service,\n\n1037\n00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:17,060\nthey don't need to be able to log in\nto the server to administer say, DNS or\n\n1038\n00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,290\nsomething like that.\n\n1039\n00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,880\nWe always follow the principle\nof least privilege,\n\n1040\n00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,100\nespecially like a domain controller.\n\n1041\n00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,570\nIn this case we happen to be\nusing a domain controller.\n\n1042\n00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,680\nBut, in order to allow somebody to\nconnect to that domain controller they'd\n\n1043\n00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,970\nhave to be in the domain admins group or\nthe account operators group or\n\n1044\n00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,570\nthe server operators group.\n\n1045\n00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:39,860\nAnd I'm not gonna make Bob, sales manager,\na domain admin just so he can remote in.\n\n1046\n00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,320\nFor administrators, it's perfect\nremote administration tool cuz\n\n1047\n00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,780\nyou get access to\nthe entire desktop at once.\n\n1048\n00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,470\nFor delegating administrative control,\n\n1049\n00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,740\nwe've got other tools that\nare gonna be a better solution.\n\n1050\n00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,120\nAll right?\nSo there, that server's rebooted.\n\n1051\n00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,300\nThankfully Server 2012 is pretty\ndarn quick on the reboot.\n\n1052\n00:48:59,300 --> 00:48:59,920\n>> Yup, pretty good.\n\n1053\n00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,880\n>> Even on a domain controller.\n\n1054\n00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,388\nPretty impressive\n>> And on a virtual machine\n\n1055\n00:49:02,388 --> 00:49:03,491\n>> I know, right?\n\n1056\n00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:06,730\n>> All right, there we go, guys.\n\n1057\n00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,900\nStart all up.\n\n1058\n00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,897\nWe'll jump back over to our client\nhere and we'll start this guy up.\n\n1059\n00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:15,938\n>> Oh no.\n\n1060\n00:49:15,938 --> 00:49:18,074\n>> [LAUGH] So funny, okay.\n\n1061\n00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:18,814\nSo-\n>> Yeah,\n\n1062\n00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:22,630\nbecause we didn't change the port number\nthat it was trying to use, right?\n\n1063\n00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,570\nIt's still trying to go to port 3389 which\nwe've changed on the domain controller, so\n\n1064\n00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,730\nit's not listening on that port anymore.\n\n1065\n00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,400\nNow how the heck are you gonna fix that?\n\n1066\n00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,350\n>> All right, so to change the port\nthat this guy is gonna use, right?\n\n1067\n00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,809\nSo we put in our computer name, right?\n\n1068\n00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:36,051\nIt hasn't changed.\n\n1069\n00:49:36,051 --> 00:49:38,385\nPut a little colon right there.\n\n1070\n00:49:38,385 --> 00:49:41,034\n33389.\n\n1071\n00:49:41,034 --> 00:49:44,946\nSo now it's contact this\ncomputer on this port.\n\n1072\n00:49:44,946 --> 00:49:46,410\n>> Has to be a little colon or\ncan it be a big colon?\n\n1073\n00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,842\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's a colon,\n\n1074\n00:49:50,842 --> 00:49:53,460\nnot a semi-colon, not a dash or\nanything like that.\n\n1075\n00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,525\nJust making sure we got that.\n\n1076\n00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:57,870\n[LAUGH] You did say little colon.\n\n1077\n00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,250\n>> I did.\nI did say little colon.\n\n1078\n00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,263\n>> I'm just giving him a hard time.\n\n1079\n00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,192\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1080\n00:50:01,192 --> 00:50:06,785\n>> So we-\n>> See if I can make him miss one.\n\n1081\n00:50:06,785 --> 00:50:08,443\n>> Yeah.\nAll right, so we're prompted for\n\n1082\n00:50:08,443 --> 00:50:10,390\nour credentials, and that's a good sign.\n\n1083\n00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,118\n>> That's good.\n>> At least made it out there.\n\n1084\n00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:14,250\n>> And honestly yeah,\nat that point you already know, right?\n\n1085\n00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,672\nThat it's working.\nBecause you're seeing that authentication\n\n1086\n00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:20,196\ndialogue box, which means you've connected\nto the server and it's now saying,\n\n1087\n00:50:20,196 --> 00:50:22,457\nwell tell me who you are before\nI allow you to do this.\n\n1088\n00:50:22,457 --> 00:50:24,350\nSo, you know you've got a connection then.\n\n1089\n00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:27,450\n>> Yup, there we go with a teenie\nmassive resolution there.\n\n1090\n00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,111\n>> Beautiful.\n\n1091\n00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:33,429\n>> And I guess for\nour purposes today that is Remote Desktop.\n\n1092\n00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:34,288\n>> That is Remote Desktop.\n\n1093\n00:50:34,288 --> 00:50:38,263\n>> You know how to remote into a machine,\nso that you can manage it, or do stuff and\n\n1094\n00:50:38,263 --> 00:50:40,040\ncheck on things.\n\n1095\n00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,520\n>> Very good, very good, all right.\n\n1096\n00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,530\nSo that's a good option for\nremote administration.\n\n1097\n00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,040\nWhat else we got?\n\n1098\n00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,690\nWhat do you wanna do next?\n\n1099\n00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:51,160\n>> Next tool, we're gonna move\non to do command line stuff.\n\n1100\n00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,802\nCommand line stuff with WinRS.\n\n1101\n00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:57,181\n>> When our, trying to think when-\n>> Woohoo?\n\n1102\n00:50:57,181 --> 00:50:58,644\n>> Yeah, command line.\n\n1103\n00:50:58,644 --> 00:50:59,610\n>> I know, I know.\n\n1104\n00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,660\nI'm kidding, I'm kidding.\n\n1105\n00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,740\nWoohoo, command line stuff.\n\n1106\n00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,940\n>> Command line stuff.\n\n1107\n00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,320\n>> Let's do it, let's do it.\n\n1108\n00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,420\n>> So first thing,\nI'm gonna get out of this guy.\n\n1109\n00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,180\nI guess, you know what?\n\n1110\n00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,610\nWe should just get just right into it.\n\n1111\n00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,470\n>> We should, I mean there's\nreally not a lot to talk about,\n\n1112\n00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,220\nit's more about just typing the commands.\n\n1113\n00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,180\nSo we're going to,\nwe'll just jump right into it, and\n\n1114\n00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,550\nstart throwing out some commands here.\n\n1115\n00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,399\nAnd then we can talk about\nthem as we do them, and\n\n1116\n00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:21,315\nwhat the heck they're\ndoing in the background.\n\n1117\n00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:24,901\n>> We're going to do the client, right?\n\n1118\n00:51:24,901 --> 00:51:27,790\nSo the clients we're gonna manage,\nand we're gonna use the server?\n\n1119\n00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,380\nOr are we gonna do it backwards?\n\n1120\n00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,340\nManage the server from the client.\n\n1121\n00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,115\n>> Yeah, I like managing\nthe server from the client.\n\n1122\n00:51:33,115 --> 00:51:33,660\n>> From the client?\n\n1123\n00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,020\n>> Yeah, but that's just me.\n\n1124\n00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1125\n00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,551\nI mean yeah it's whatever.\n\n1126\n00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:38,654\nYeah, okay.\n\n1127\n00:51:38,654 --> 00:51:39,710\n>> Whatever's clever.\n\n1128\n00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,280\n>> All right, well okay then.\n\n1129\n00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,960\nWe'll start off by going to the server.\n\n1130\n00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,860\n>> Probably more common\nthan the other way around.\n\n1131\n00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,720\nRight?\nI'm not going into the server closet and\n\n1132\n00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:57,470\npulling out the KVM to remotely manage\nBob's computer or something like that.\n\n1133\n00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,720\nTo make it more realistic,\nI mean it would work either way.\n\n1134\n00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,405\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm. Yeah.\n\n1135\n00:52:00,405 --> 00:52:01,515\n>> And there might be a time.\nAnd\n\n1136\n00:52:01,515 --> 00:52:06,700\nthat's not to say that a true geek might\nbe sitting at their desk in their cubicle\n\n1137\n00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:11,080\nand have Server 2012 running as\ntheir operating system, right?\n\n1138\n00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,900\nSo there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n1139\n00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,530\n>> I guess that's always a possibility.\n\n1140\n00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,720\n>> Server's a good operating system.\n\n1141\n00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,880\n>> Well, yeah.\n>> I use that as my desktop\n\n1142\n00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,540\noperating system.\n\n1143\n00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,400\n>> Do you?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1144\n00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,760\n>> What are you running on this?\n\n1145\n00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,355\n>> Windows 8.\n\n1146\n00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:22,204\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n1147\n00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:22,730\nAll right.\n\n1148\n00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:23,560\nRight on.\n\n1149\n00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,635\nBut first things first, right?\n\n1150\n00:52:24,635 --> 00:52:28,758\nTo use this WinRM, WinRS commands, right?\n\n1151\n00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:31,404\nThe computer we are going to manage,\nright?\n\n1152\n00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:34,080\nWe have to get that guy prepped and ready.\n\n1153\n00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> And fortunately\n\n1154\n00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,810\nit's just an easy command that will\nkinda do a lot of the legwork for-\n\n1155\n00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:39,610\n>> It does, doesn't it?\n\n1156\n00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:45,420\n>> All right, we'll start off by using\nan administrative command prompt.\n\n1157\n00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,120\n>> Nice.\n\n1158\n00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,704\n>> I'll make that a bit larger.\n\n1159\n00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:51,527\n>> That would be helpful for\nmy tired old eyes.\n\n1160\n00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:55,266\nI'm sure the folks out there\nat home appreciate it as well.\n\n1161\n00:52:57,728 --> 00:52:58,680\nOkay, maybe not that big.\n\n1162\n00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,270\nThere you go.\n\n1163\n00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,140\nI like it.\n\n1164\n00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,460\nWoohoo!\n>> All right,\n\n1165\n00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:07,230\nthe command we're gonna\ndo is WinRM quickconfig.\n\n1166\n00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,020\n>> Quickconfig.\n\n1167\n00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,140\nAnd it's just that, isn't it?\n\n1168\n00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:09,932\n>> Just that.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1169\n00:53:09,932 --> 00:53:11,954\nIt is quick.\n>> Oh man.\n\n1170\n00:53:11,954 --> 00:53:13,254\n>> It's already running on this guy.\n\n1171\n00:53:13,254 --> 00:53:14,390\n>> It's already running.\n\n1172\n00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,120\nDidn't we revert these guys?\n\n1173\n00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,880\n>> Anyway, how about the client?\n\n1174\n00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,530\nWe can show them on the client.\n\n1175\n00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,530\nIt's not done on the client yet\nand we can still come back and\n\n1176\n00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,270\ndo it this way as well.\n\n1177\n00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,590\nSo let's show what he's doing now,\nhe ran that command,\n\n1178\n00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,530\nand we can see that that command\nhad already been executed.\n\n1179\n00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,140\nAnd I want to show you guys,\nwe want to show you,\n\n1180\n00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,625\nwhat it looks like when you run\nthat command for the first time.\n\n1181\n00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,450\nCuz it does prompt you with a couple\nthings and it tells you what it's going to\n\n1182\n00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,110\ndo to your machine,\nto make sure you're okay with doing that.\n\n1183\n00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:45,900\nSo, same command WinRM space\nquickconfig all one word quickconfig.\n\n1184\n00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,520\n>> There we go.\n\n1185\n00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,606\n>> And that's what we're looking for.\n\n1186\n00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:53,480\n>> All right, so it starts off and\nit says when RM is not setup\n\n1187\n00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,470\nto receive requests on this machine,\nthe following changes must be made.\n\n1188\n00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,532\nAll right, start the WinRM service, right?\n\n1189\n00:53:59,532 --> 00:54:00,573\nSo, we want it up.\n\n1190\n00:54:00,573 --> 00:54:03,012\nSet the WinRM service type\nto delayed auto start.\n\n1191\n00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:03,952\nYeah, sure.\n\n1192\n00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,460\nAll right, so we'll push yes.\n\n1193\n00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,936\n>> We hit Y for yes.\n\n1194\n00:54:06,936 --> 00:54:09,450\n>> All right, WinRM has been\nupdated to receive requests.\n\n1195\n00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,270\nAll right, what's next?\n\n1196\n00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,415\nWinRM service, changed successfully.\n\n1197\n00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:16,280\nAll right, then start service, start up.\n\n1198\n00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,800\nAnd then set to allow remote access to\nthis machine management, must be made,\n\n1199\n00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,930\nyadda, yadda, yadda and\nnow it needs it's firewall rules.\n\n1200\n00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:26,490\n>> Yeah, so basically that first\nyes is saying let's go ahead and\n\n1201\n00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:30,200\nstart the service that's required for\nWin Remote Management and\n\n1202\n00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,730\nthen it says hey, by the way, you're\nalso gonna need to make a firewall rule\n\n1203\n00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:36,550\nto allow these commands to come through.\n\n1204\n00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,630\nSo we hit yes to that and\nwe should be good to go.\n\n1205\n00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,920\n>> No, it's like a suite of rules, right?\n\n1206\n00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,420\n>> It is.\nI mean, there's a few different ones that\n\n1207\n00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,370\nit's gonna generate.\n\n1208\n00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:45,670\nYep.\n\n1209\n00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:47,460\n>> And just like that, there it goes.\n\n1210\n00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,480\nIt's all done.\n\n1211\n00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,470\nPretty easy command.\n\n1212\n00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,190\n>> Pretty darn easy, right?\n\n1213\n00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,930\n>> But very necessary.\n\n1214\n00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:52,800\n>> Yes.\n\n1215\n00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,880\nAnd you could, if you wanted to, you\ncould go in and do those manually, right?\n\n1216\n00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,680\nI mean I would have to use\nthe WinRM quickconfig.\n\n1217\n00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,300\nI could go into my services console.\n\n1218\n00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,780\nI could find that WinRM service and\nI could turn it onto automatic, or\n\n1219\n00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,730\nglade start, or\nwhatever I wanted to choose.\n\n1220\n00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:07,290\nI could go into Windows Firewall and\n\n1221\n00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:12,640\nthere's some pre-built commands I could\nuse or I could build my own, but why?\n\n1222\n00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,365\nWinRm quickconfig and [NOISE].\n\n1223\n00:55:14,365 --> 00:55:17,650\n>> It kinda goes against\neverything we're working for.\n\n1224\n00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,930\nI mean, is to not get up?\n\n1225\n00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:20,510\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n1226\n00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:24,030\n>> So actually-\n>> We could Remote Desktop in and\n\n1227\n00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,620\ndo all that, so I still wouldn't\nhave to put my Mai Tai down.\n\n1228\n00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,810\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n1229\n00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,830\n>> We could do it that way, but you know,\n\n1230\n00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,660\nthe whole thing is to work smarter,\nnot harder.\n\n1231\n00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,799\n>> I like-\n>> So if I can do it with one command,\n\n1232\n00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,190\nthat's the route I'm going.\n\n1233\n00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:37,734\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n1234\n00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,276\nAll right well since, okay so\nwe run it on here but\n\n1235\n00:55:40,276 --> 00:55:42,460\nit was already running On the server one.\n\n1236\n00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,614\n>> Yep.\n>> So, we'll just-\n\n1237\n00:55:44,614 --> 00:55:46,556\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah, let's just stay here,\n\n1238\n00:55:46,556 --> 00:55:48,444\nand see if we can do some WinRM commands.\n\n1239\n00:55:48,444 --> 00:55:49,760\n>> All right.\n\n1240\n00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,783\nSo now to run a command on the server.\n\n1241\n00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:54,872\n>> A little CLS first.\n\n1242\n00:55:54,872 --> 00:55:56,720\nYou know what I mean,\nI'm a little OCD about that.\n\n1243\n00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n1244\n00:55:58,677 --> 00:56:00,289\n>> Sorry.\n\n1245\n00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:02,786\n>> Okay, so what we're gonna do is, oh.\n\n1246\n00:56:02,786 --> 00:56:04,889\nOkay, Just kidding.\nAll right.\n\n1247\n00:56:04,889 --> 00:56:06,585\nWinRS, right?\n\n1248\n00:56:06,585 --> 00:56:08,293\n>> WinRS, okay.\n\n1249\n00:56:08,293 --> 00:56:10,155\nWhat's that stand for?\n\n1250\n00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:11,780\nRemote service?\n\n1251\n00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,270\nRunning service?\n\n1252\n00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,993\n>> I think so.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1253\n00:56:14,993 --> 00:56:15,493\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n1254\n00:56:15,493 --> 00:56:16,965\nService.\n\n1255\n00:56:16,965 --> 00:56:18,587\nI get so used to [CROSSTALK]\n\n1256\n00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:19,560\n>> Remote session, I believe.\n\n1257\n00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,439\n>> Remote session?\n\n1258\n00:56:20,439 --> 00:56:20,979\n>> I'll find out for\n\n1259\n00:56:20,979 --> 00:56:24,488\nyou while you're doing that command there.\n>> You know you just learn it for,\n\n1260\n00:56:24,488 --> 00:56:25,943\nI don't know.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1261\n00:56:25,943 --> 00:56:26,453\n>> Okay, Mike.\n\n1262\n00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:27,088\nThanks a lot.\n\n1263\n00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:27,877\n>> [LAUGH] Sorry,\n\n1264\n00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:29,600\nthrow you under the bus there.\n\n1265\n00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,890\nI actually know it, too.\n\n1266\n00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:34,260\nYou type it in over and over and\nover again and you never actually look and\n\n1267\n00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,900\nsee what the acronym stands for.\n\n1268\n00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,460\nBut sometimes I think knowing\nwhat the acronym stands for\n\n1269\n00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,980\nhelps you remember it in\nlike an exam situation.\n\n1270\n00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:45,859\nAnd they might not even say\non the Microsoft site what it\n\n1271\n00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:47,031\nactually stands for.\n\n1272\n00:56:51,816 --> 00:56:55,149\nThey don't, so it's just WinRS.\n\n1273\n00:56:55,149 -->

succeed or\n\n1304\n00:57:57,032 --> 00:57:58,110\nit didn't succeed with that.\n\n1305\n00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:58,790\n>> It would be nice.\n\n1306\n00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,680\n>> They just let you go\nabout your business.\n\n1307\n00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,390\n>> Yep.\n\n1308\n00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,490\nAll right, well yeah.\n\n1309\n00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,110\nI guess let's jump over to our server.\n\n1310\n00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:04,780\n>> Let's see if it works.\n\n1311\n00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,805\n>> Let's check for the mikemike folder.\n\n1312\n00:58:06,805 --> 00:58:08,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1313\n00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,390\n>> There's this guy.\n\n1314\n00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,215\nLet's fire this guy up.\n\n1315\n00:58:10,215 --> 00:58:11,477\n>> What day is it?\n\n1316\n00:58:11,477 --> 00:58:15,076\n>> [SOUND] Oh, there it is mikemike.\n\n1317\n00:58:15,076 --> 00:58:16,450\n>> And there's mikemike, mikemikemike.\n\n1318\n00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,220\nFantastic.\n\n1319\n00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,977\nSo yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1320\n00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:21,969\n>> Real easy example of how to use\nthat Windows Remote Management and\n\n1321\n00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,645\nWinRS to fire any command.\n\n1322\n00:58:23,645 --> 00:58:26,830\nAnd we did a pretty simple command there,\nbut you can use your imagination and\n\n1323\n00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,180\nyou should test it out.\n\n1324\n00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,310\nPlay, right?\n\n1325\n00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,270\nIf you guys, when you're studying for\nthese exams, try these commands.\n\n1326\n00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:36,798\nSet yourself up a little test environment\nusing like we're doing here, Hyper-V,\n\n1327\n00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:38,531\nwhich is built into Windows 8.\n\n1328\n00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:41,044\nSure we're gonna do\na great session on that.\n\n1329\n00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:42,309\n>> On Windows 8?\n\n1330\n00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,794\n>> No, on Client Hyper-V.\n\n1331\n00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:47,055\nNot sure if you guys have\nalready done that one or if we-\n\n1332\n00:58:47,055 --> 00:58:48,385\n>> Hyper-V-\n\n1333\n00:58:48,385 --> 00:58:49,870\n>> The next Client Hyper-V.\n\n1334\n00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:50,890\nOr get you a little program.\n\n1335\n00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,010\nCan we mention programs on here?\n\n1336\n00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,890\n>> I don't know.\n\n1337\n00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:55,690\nIt depends.\n>> Can I say Virtual Box?\n\n1338\n00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:57,860\nI didn't say it.\n\n1339\n00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,050\n>> Oh my gosh.\n>> Oh wait, I already said it.\n\n1340\n00:58:59,050 --> 00:58:59,880\nOh well.\nBut yeah,\n\n1341\n00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,730\nthere's many different virtualization\ntechnologies that are out there.\n\n1342\n00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,600\nIf you don't,\nif you're not running Windows 8 that has\n\n1343\n00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,120\nclient Hyper-V built in there,\ntest these things out.\n\n1344\n00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,320\nGet in there is play cuz they're a lot\nof fun, and that's how you study for\n\n1345\n00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,700\nthe exam, right?\n\n1346\n00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,410\nIs you can read these commands, but mine,\n\n1347\n00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:20,022\nthey don't sink in until I get in there\nand do them, so try them out guys.\n\n1348\n00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:23,800\n>> All right. Right on.\nWell, we're up on break.\n\n1349\n00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,640\nWe'll take a break, and\n\n1350\n00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,630\nwhen we come back we'll dive into\nmore Remote Management tools.\n\n1351\n00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:29,534\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n1352\n00:59:29,534 --> 00:59:31,985\n>> See you back in a few minutes.\n\n1353\n00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:39,950\n>> [NOISE]\n>> All right, well welcome back.\n\n1354\n00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,940\nAll right, we've got a few more\ntools to go through, right?\n\n1355\n00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,160\nWe're gonna do the same thing we\ndid before but with PowerShell.\n\n1356\n00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,671\n>> Yeah, we'll break out PowerShell and\nplay with that one.\n\n1357\n00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:49,780\nFun, fun.\n\n1358\n00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:53,410\n>> And we'll play with a whole bunch,\njust a little bit.\n\n1359\n00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:58,800\nAnd then we've got the using\nMMCs to do the same thing.\n\n1360\n00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,601\nWe're going to use RSAT to do it.\n\n1361\n01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:07,335\nIt's pretty neat tool, so\nI think it's worth touching on.\n\n1362\n01:00:07,335 --> 01:00:08,390\n>> Oh yea.\n\n1363\n01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,109\nAbsolutely.\n\n1364\n01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:12,906\nIt's another one of our choices that we\nhave when we talk about Remote Management,\n\n1365\n01:00:12,906 --> 01:00:15,852\nso we really need to show all\nthe different options that we have.\n\n1366\n01:00:15,852 --> 01:00:17,590\nSo let's dive into some PowerShell first.\n\n1367\n01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:18,680\nLet's take a peek at that.\n\n1368\n01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:26,150\nVery similar to what we were doing with\nthe WinRM, PowerShell being the newer,\n\n1369\n01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:30,340\nI think maybe more preferred because\nit's a little bit easier to work with,\n\n1370\n01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,500\nlittle bit easier to script and\nthings like that.\n\n1371\n01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,505\nIt's definitely much more powerful,\nI mean, hence the name, PowerShell.\n\n1372\n01:00:36,505 --> 01:00:37,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1373\n01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,480\nIt is a good name.\n\n1374\n01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,436\n>> It is.\n>> A good name for it.\n\n1375\n01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:41,370\nIt is a PowerShell.\n\n1376\n01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:41,920\n>> It works.\n\n1377\n01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,900\n>> Shell thing.\n\n1378\n01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,950\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n1379\n01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:44,760\nSo, we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n1380\n01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,490\nWe're gonna use the client\nto manage the server.\n\n1381\n01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,280\n>> Okay.\n\n1382\n01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,620\nAll right, sounds like a plan.\n\n1383\n01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:55,447\n>> So, first thing what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna jump over to the server\n\n1384\n01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:58,630\nmachine and\nwe'll run a couple of commands.\n\n1385\n01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,070\nSo, let's go to our start screen.\n\n1386\n01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,950\n>> Yeah, he's gonna open up Power shell.\n\n1387\n01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,811\nObviously, that'd be the first thing we'd\nwant to do if we want to use PowerShell,\n\n1388\n01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:06,610\nremotely managed.\n\n1389\n01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:07,768\n>> We're gonna do\nan administrative PowerShell.\n\n1390\n01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:09,230\n>> An administrative PowerShell?\n\n1391\n01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:09,788\n>> Might as well.\n\n1392\n01:01:09,788 --> 01:01:11,740\n>> To make sure it has\nthe right credentials, right?\n\n1393\n01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,200\nAnd then we'll adjust that font.\n\n1394\n01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,600\nYeah it comes out really, really small.\n\n1395\n01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,560\n>> 24, is that what we used last time?\n\n1396\n01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,110\n>> I think so.\n\n1397\n01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:21,036\nIt fits nicely.\n\n1398\n01:01:21,036 --> 01:01:22,581\n>> It does.\n\n1399\n01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:23,712\nAll right.\n\n1400\n01:01:23,712 --> 01:01:26,260\n>> All right, so yeah, PowerShell.\n\n1401\n01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:31,510\nWell, I think we'll get into more\nlike the commandlets, the syntax,\n\n1402\n01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:35,097\nand the things later but for this-\n>> Yeah, here we're not really\n\n1403\n01:01:35,097 --> 01:01:38,630\ntalking about, this is not the show to\nlearn how to use PowerShell, right?\n\n1404\n01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,801\nWe've got another episode that\nwe go over PowerShell and\n\n1405\n01:01:41,801 --> 01:01:44,120\nwe talk about it from the very beginning.\n\n1406\n01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,690\nHow to type these commandlets.\n\n1407\n01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,020\nHow to get great help\non these commandlets.\n\n1408\n01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,569\nHow the Tab Autofill works.\n\n1409\n01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,172\nDid Jay Burke give you that one?\n\n1410\n01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:56,271\n[CROSSTALK] I know Jay Burke,\nhe's right up there, he's probably-\n\n1411\n01:01:56,271 --> 01:01:56,930\n>> He might.\n\n1412\n01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:00,200\nHe probably would,\nif we let him back on the show.\n\n1413\n01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,368\n>> Yeah, if we allow him to come back.\n\n1414\n01:02:02,368 --> 01:02:03,640\nMr. Mario there.\n\n1415\n01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,280\nNo, he is a PowerShell fanatic.\n\n1416\n01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:11,530\nHe loves his PowerShell, and yes,\nhe'd be a great one to get to do that.\n\n1417\n01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:15,240\nBut anyway, so\nat this point we won't go over the basics.\n\n1418\n01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,680\nWe're just gonna go right into\nthe commands we would use for\n\n1419\n01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,830\nRemote Management.\n\n1420\n01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:24,360\n>> First thing, get Service WinRM.\n\n1421\n01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,070\n>> Okay.\n\n1422\n01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:25,904\n>> There we go.\n\n1423\n01:02:25,904 --> 01:02:28,838\nIt's running, all right, so name WinRM.\n\n1424\n01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:29,985\nIt is running, so we're good.\n\n1425\n01:02:29,985 --> 01:02:31,510\nSo we got-\n>> That's on\n\n1426\n01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,700\nthe DC-\n>> Yup.\n\n1427\n01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,590\n>> That we're trying to\nremotely administer?\n\n1428\n01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,363\n>> Correct.\n>> So, this would be one that you would\n\n1429\n01:02:37,363 --> 01:02:40,891\nfire on the machine that\nyou're trying to connect to.\n\n1430\n01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,075\n>> Enable PS remoting,\n\n1431\n01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:46,565\nwe just use the force command cuz we don't\nwanna have to mess with anything else.\n\n1432\n01:02:46,565 --> 01:02:50,038\nWe'll go ahead and\n[SOUND] did I spell it right?\n\n1433\n01:02:50,038 --> 01:02:53,935\n>> PS remoting has two S's there I think,\nwhich only needs one.\n\n1434\n01:02:58,690 --> 01:02:59,430\nPerfect.\n\n1435\n01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,050\n>> Much better.\n\n1436\n01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:03,450\n>> Nice thing about PowerShell is you get\nred text, you know something's wrong.\n\n1437\n01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,030\nYeah, when the screen starts bleeding,\nyou're in trouble.\n\n1438\n01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:10,700\nBut, very good help when\nyou get these errors\n\n1439\n01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,400\nunlike in prior versions of Windows and\nsome of our other tools, it tells you.\n\n1440\n01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,270\nIn fact,\nif you read that enable PS remoting,\n\n1441\n01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,880\nthe term enable PS remoting\nis not recognized.\n\n1442\n01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,750\nSo I know immediately where my error is.\n\n1443\n01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,620\nI don't have to scan\nthrough this command and\n\n1444\n01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,490\ntry to figure out where I made this typo,\nso I like that.\n\n1445\n01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:27,145\n>> Right on.\n>> So\n\n1446\n01:03:27,145 --> 01:03:31,020\nhe made that error on purpose just\nto show you guys what happens.\n\n1447\n01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:31,750\n>> Thanks Mike.\n\n1448\n01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,308\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so there we go.\n\n1449\n01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:36,628\nEverything's running.\nI think we're good to go on the server.\n\n1450\n01:03:36,628 --> 01:03:41,568\nLet's jump back over to the client\nmachine We'll do the same thing,\n\n1451\n01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,647\nwe'll get PowerShell as administrator.\n\n1452\n01:03:44,647 --> 01:03:47,468\nLet me try that again.\n\n1453\n01:03:47,468 --> 01:03:49,690\n>> Little too clickety fast?\n\n1454\n01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:52,240\n>> Well, it's this Bluetooth mouse.\n\n1455\n01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,355\nSometimes it does what it wants.\n\n1456\n01:03:54,355 --> 01:03:55,745\nBetter than the trackpad on these things.\n\n1457\n01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:57,955\n>> Oh, my gosh.\n\n1458\n01:03:57,955 --> 01:03:59,865\n>> Love you Dale, but\nthis trackpad on my XPS is.\n\n1459\n01:03:59,865 --> 01:04:00,365\n>> Awful.\n\n1460\n01:04:02,915 -->

are cool laptops, though.\n\n1464\n01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,065\nI appreciate it, Mike.\n\n1465\n01:04:10,065 --> 01:04:13,400\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, scroll back.\n\n1466\n01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,359\n>> Back to what we were going to do today.\n\n1467\n01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:19,400\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, what we're going to do, right,\n\n1468\n01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,890\nlet's make sure that we can reach out\n\n1469\n01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:23,470\nto that computer\n>> Right.\n\n1470\n01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:28,650\n>> That we're trying to go to, and\nit is test connection and then\n\n1471\n01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:29,600\n>> The computer's name.\n\n1472\n01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,749\n>> Yup.\n>> And, it is dc01.\n\n1473\n01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:33,536\nRuns perfect.\n\n1474\n01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,349\nRight.\n\n1475\n01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:36,717\n>> [NOISE]\n>> We're connecting.\n\n1476\n01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:40,290\nEverything is gonna work,\nand we can proceed forward.\n\n1477\n01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:40,850\n>> Nice.\n>> All right.\n\n1478\n01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:44,340\n>> Nice.\n>> Now, there's two ways that we can use\n\n1479\n01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:50,760\nPowerShell to run commands or remotely\n>> Command another machine.\n\n1480\n01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,550\n>> Right.\n\n1481\n01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:52,130\n>> Two commands.\n\n1482\n01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:58,110\nThere's the enter ps session and\ninvoke command.\n\n1483\n01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:02,380\nNow, enter ps session,\nit's gonna change our right now,\n\n1484\n01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,778\nit says BS, and\nthen our little Windows System32.\n\n1485\n01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:10,900\nThe enter PS session,\nthat font will change, and it will show\n\n1486\n01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:16,220\nour computer name, so what we type in\nthere is gonna run on that other computer.\n\n1487\n01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,130\n>> On our prompt there on our PowerShell,\nyup.\n\n1488\n01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,840\nYup, very good.\n\n1489\n01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,080\n>> Oh yeah, go ahead.\n\n1490\n01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,640\n>> Well, why use one or the other?\n\n1491\n01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,250\nWhat's the difference there?\n\n1492\n01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,660\n>> I don't know.\n>> Well, let's tell them at home.\n\n1493\n01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,840\nHe knows, he's messing with you guys.\n\n1494\n01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,120\nDepending, if I have a single command that\nI wanna fire against that remote machine,\n\n1495\n01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,440\nthen it might be easy just\nto type in dash command,\n\n1496\n01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,180\nthe name of the computer I'm trying\nto fire the command against,\n\n1497\n01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,080\ntype in the command and\nI'm done and I close power shell.\n\n1498\n01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,650\nIf I have many commands that I want to\nexecute against that remote machine,\n\n1499\n01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:51,860\nI might get tired of typing invoke\ndash command dash computer name,\n\n1500\n01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,020\nthe name of the computer, 20 times\nin a row, for 20 different commands.\n\n1501\n01:05:55,020 --> 01:06:00,500\nRight, so I can just enter in a PS\nsession, where now my prompt will change,\n\n1502\n01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:05,150\nto where it has them name of the computer\nout in front of the PS over there, and\n\n1503\n01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:08,060\nevery command I fire will going\nagainst the remote session,\n\n1504\n01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:11,060\nwithout having to specify the name\nof the computer each time.\n\n1505\n01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:13,980\nSo, it really just depends on how\nmany commands you have to fire.\n\n1506\n01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,760\n>> Nice.\n>> So let's try one,\n\n1507\n01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,280\nyou want to do one where\nwe just invoke a command\n\n1508\n01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,790\nwhere we don't have a permanent session.\n\n1509\n01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:22,650\n>> All right.\n\n1510\n01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,770\n>> So we can do something like,\nI don't know you pick a command,\n\n1511\n01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:26,000\none of your favorite commands.\n\n1512\n01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,400\n>> All right, invoke command, computer,\nand then the computer's name.\n\n1513\n01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,720\nIt is.\n>> As you can see here,\n\n1514\n01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,460\nNate is doing a little bit of a shortcut.\n\n1515\n01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:38,209\nThe command, the parameter,\n[CROSSTALK] No, it's fine.\n\n1516\n01:06:38,209 --> 01:06:41,850\nI don't mind you doing the shortcut,\nit's good to know that they're there.\n\n1517\n01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,790\nSome of these commands, and\nsome of the parameters,\n\n1518\n01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:48,960\nlike -computer is a parameter,\n-computer name is the full parameter name.\n\n1519\n01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,580\nThe power cells smart enough to know,\n\n1520\n01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,400\nthat if you just type -computer it's\ngoing to let you get away with it.\n\n1521\n01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,190\nWhich is cool.\n\n1522\n01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:56,300\nThat's-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1523\n01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,230\n>> That's four less characters I've\n\n1524\n01:06:59,230 --> 01:06:59,758\ngot to type.\n\n1525\n01:06:59,758 --> 01:07:02,750\n[LAUGH]\n>> Write the name of the computer.\n\n1526\n01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:06,500\nSo -computer, then the name of\nthe computer you want to connect to, and\n\n1527\n01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:13,180\nthen the command that we want to do goes\ninto a squiggly, and it bond a brace.\n\n1528\n01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,070\n>> A brace?\n>> Yes.\n\n1529\n01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,020\n>> And what's the-\n>> Verses a bracket,\n\n1530\n01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,650\nwhich would be the squares.\n\n1531\n01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,240\n>> All right.\n\n1532\n01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,650\nThe command goes in a brace.\n\n1533\n01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:22,658\n>> But that's what I call them too,\nsquigglies and squares.\n\n1534\n01:07:22,658 --> 01:07:25,795\n>> [LAUGH] That's the technical jargon.\n\n1535\n01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:27,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Thanks, Mike.\n\n1536\n01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,600\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, so we're going to do,\n\n1537\n01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,410\nwe'll just do the same thing I\nwould have done before, right?\n\n1538\n01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:33,910\nOkay.\n\n1539\n01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:40,610\nMake a directory C:\\ we're gonna call this\none natenate, and we'll close the brace.\n\n1540\n01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:44,590\nRun that guy and, oh sweet.\n\n1541\n01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:48,010\nSo, we get a little bit more\nfeedback than with the WinRS.\n\n1542\n01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:48,800\n>> Yes, we did.\n>> Which is-\n\n1543\n01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,940\n>> Gave us a blank line and said,\n\n1544\n01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,610\nhey, okay, cool, there you go.\n\n1545\n01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,780\n>> Here I can see that we\nactually created that folder.\n\n1546\n01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,760\nGot it completed.\n\n1547\n01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,890\n>> Yup.\n\n1548\n01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:00,420\n>> But you notice we're also back to\nour normal PowerShell prompt there, so\n\n1549\n01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,080\nif I wanted to do another\ncommand against DC1,\n\n1550\n01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,760\nwe'd have to type the invoke\ncommand all over again.\n\n1551\n01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,160\nWhich is a lot of typing.\n\n1552\n01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:16,790\n>> So, lets do a PS session then.\n\n1553\n01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,480\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n1554\n01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,340\n>> So, let's see what that one looks like.\n\n1555\n01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:25,270\nTo establish a permanent,\nnot a permanent, but a session, we type\n\n1556\n01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:30,090\nin enter -PS session, and then the name of\nthe computer that we want to connect to.\n\n1557\n01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,650\n>> Okay, and we hit Enter.\n\n1558\n01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:40,100\nAnd assuming that PS\nremoting has been enabled on\n\n1559\n01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:44,150\nthe computer we're connecting to, we now\nhave, and notice the prompt has changed.\n\n1560\n01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:47,510\nSo, out at the front of the prompt\nhas the name of the computer.\n\n1561\n01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:50,310\nSo now, anything I type at that prompt is\n\n1562\n01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,950\nnot gonna be fired\nagainst my local machine.\n\n1563\n01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:54,380\nIt's gonna be fired against DC01.\n\n1564\n01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,770\nSo I can do command, after command,\nafter command without having to\n\n1565\n01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:02,130\nretype that whole invoke computer name.\n\n1566\n01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:04,110\n>> So, let's look for\nthat Nate and eight folder.\n\n1567\n01:09:04,110 -->

manage DNS\nservers from my Windows 8 machine?\n\n1626\n01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,860\n>> By using Microsoft consoles.\n\n1627\n01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,930\n>> Yeah, by using RSAT, exactly.\n\n1628\n01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:14,880\nHe's so smart.\n\n1629\n01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,550\nSo yeah,\nwe can download RSAT from Microsoft,\n\n1630\n01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:22,380\nRSAT being Remote Server Administration\nTools, freely available from Microsoft.\n\n1631\n01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,790\nAnd on a server, when you install\na server operating system,\n\n1632\n01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:26,800\nall these consoles are already there.\n\n1633\n01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,844\nOn a client however, they're not there, so\nwe have to download RSAT and install it,\n\n1634\n01:11:30,844 --> 01:11:34,722\nwhich you've already done on your computer\nso we have to be sure to have that pulled\n\n1635\n01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:38,339\nup, and that's gonna give me the ability\nto create my own custom consoles.\n\n1636\n01:11:38,339 --> 01:11:42,401\nSo, all we have to do is type in or\ngo to a run dialogue box or\n\n1637\n01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:47,485\nWindows 8 back on our start screen and\ntype MMC Mike, Mike, Charlie,\n\n1638\n01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:52,689\nfor Microsoft management console and\nthat gives us this shell of a tool.\n\n1639\n01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:55,334\nNow, MMC on it's own does nothing, right,\n\n1640\n01:11:55,334 --> 01:11:58,952\nthere's no functionality there\nit’s just a shell of a tool,\n\n1641\n01:11:58,952 --> 01:12:03,930\nAll those pre-built consoles we use,\ntheir based off of the same console.\n\n1642\n01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:05,510\nNice thing about that is,\n\n1643\n01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:08,560\nonce you learn the layout of this\nconsole all the tools look the same.\n\n1644\n01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,970\nSo, you don't have to navigate around\ndifferent tools with different lays and\n\n1645\n01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:12,480\nthings like that.\n\n1646\n01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:16,050\nSo, now that you got\nthis console opened up,\n\n1647\n01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,760\nwe need to add some functionality to it.\n\n1648\n01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,390\nSo, if we're gonna manage DNS.\n\n1649\n01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:22,800\nThen we want to add our DNS snap in.\n\n1650\n01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,580\nThey're refered to as snap in's.\n\n1651\n01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,720\nSo, we do file, add remove snap in.\n\n1652\n01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,580\nAnd because we've installed our set,\n\n1653\n01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:32,340\nwe have all of those cool\nsnap in's that we can add.\n\n1654\n01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:35,300\nA lot of these come with Windows 8,\nbut as far as the server stuff.\n\n1655\n01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,660\nDNS, DHCP, Active Directory, Users and\nComputers, things like that.\n\n1656\n01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,620\nAll of that's going to be From\nthose Rs that we installed.\n\n1657\n01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,110\nSo, what do you wanna do,\nwanna do some DHCP?\n\n1658\n01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,250\nI don't know what you're running\non that domain controller.\n\n1659\n01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,430\n>> Yeah, DHCP and DNS.\n\n1660\n01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,860\n>> Add them both.\n\n1661\n01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,680\nLet's do them both.\n\n1662\n01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,840\nSee, that's the great thing about MMCs.\n\n1663\n01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,970\nIf I'm an administrator, instead of having\nto open up two separate tools, one for\n\n1664\n01:12:56,970 --> 01:13:02,100\nDNS one for DHCP, I can make my own custom\ntool and put both of them in there, and,\n\n1665\n01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:07,990\nnow I've got one tool to open up,\nisn't that fancy, right?\n\n1666\n01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:08,920\n>> That is fancy.\n\n1667\n01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,589\n>> I like it.\n>> Add them in there, click OK\n\n1668\n01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:16,020\n>> And there we go, all right?\n\n1669\n01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:18,030\nNow when you try to click on DNS for\nthe first time,\n\n1670\n01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:21,290\nobviously DNS is not running\non the client machine, so\n\n1671\n01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,320\nwe have to tell it what server\nwe're trying to get administrator.\n\n1672\n01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,400\nSo, we should be able to\nchoose the following computer.\n\n1673\n01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:34,060\nRight click on that DNS and\nconnect to the DNS server, and\n\n1674\n01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:38,900\nthen the following computer, and theres\na little check mark to say connect now,\n\n1675\n01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:39,820\nwhich we've already got checked.\n\n1676\n01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,100\nAnd assuming we have administrative,\nassuming we're an administrator on that\n\n1677\n01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,040\nmachine, and have rights to manage DNS,\nthere it is.\n\n1678\n01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,830\nYou should be able to expand out DC01.\n\n1679\n01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:52,510\n>> Oh yeah, it didn't ask for\nany credentials.\n\n1680\n01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,640\n>> Nope.\n\n1681\n01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,650\nBecause you're probably doing some\npass-through authentication here.\n\n1682\n01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,970\nIs your username the same\nas the username on the DC?\n\n1683\n01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:02,890\n>> Yeah, the username I created\nis in the domain admins.\n\n1684\n01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:03,570\nOkay, there you go.\n\n1685\n01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:06,970\nSo, you have domain admin rights, so\nshould be able to expand out DC01,\n\n1686\n01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:08,440\nthere's my forward look up zones,\n\n1687\n01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:13,180\njust like I'd see on the DNS console if\nI physically went to the DNS server or\n\n1688\n01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:17,650\nif I remote desktopped into the DNS\nserver the same console access there.\n\n1689\n01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:18,490\nAnd we can do whatever we want.\n\n1690\n01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:20,285\nWe can create new zones, whatever.\n\n1691\n01:14:20,285 --> 01:14:21,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1692\n01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:22,010\nYeah.\n>> Beautiful.\n\n1693\n01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:25,960\n>> So, yup, I think of course I will get\ninto all these other folders and things.\n\n1694\n01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> But yeah, so, MMC, custom MMC,\n\n1695\n01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:35,780\nright here, we can use from our local Win\n8 computer, right, Windows 8 computer.\n\n1696\n01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,020\n>> Yup.\n>> To manage another computer,\n\n1697\n01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,640\nnow, with the-\n>> What?\n\n1698\n01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,630\n>> You want to connect it to the?\n\n1699\n01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:41,850\nLet's go ahead and finish it up.\n\n1700\n01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,070\nConnect it to that DHCP server.\n\n1701\n01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:44,430\nRight click the same thing.\n\n1702\n01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:47,440\nJust right click on DHCP and connect.\n\n1703\n01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,440\nThey could be different servers.\n\n1704\n01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,420\nThey wouldn't even have to be the same.\n\n1705\n01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,480\n>> Hm.\n>> It already sees.\n\n1706\n01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:55,360\nSo, yup, you can choose this authorized\nDHCP server, that little radio button.\n\n1707\n01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:00,800\nCuz Active Directory, in another session\nwe'll talk about that Active Directory\n\n1708\n01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,785\nmaintains a list of authorized servers,\n\n1709\n01:15:02,785 --> 01:15:06,036\nto prevent those rogue DHCP servers\nfrom infiltrating my network.\n\n1710\n01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:09,792\nAnd, there it is.\n\n1711\n01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:14,650\nAnd, if this was something I did as a job,\nif this was my The console I\n\n1712\n01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:18,890\nuse to do my daily job I would\nwant to save this console.\n\n1713\n01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:22,580\nI wouldn't want to have to create\nthis console every time every day, so\n\n1714\n01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,860\nwe do file save and\nI typically put it on my desktop.\n\n1715\n01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:29,440\nYeah, so\nthat's the quick easy place to access it.\n\n1716\n01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,865\n>> Is DF works for me.\n\n1717\n01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:34,670\n[LAUGH]\nAnd now there she is, you got your little\n\n1718\n01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:37,860\nred tool box, all you have to do when you\ncome into work now is double click on that\n\n1719\n01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,985\nand you have access to all of your\nadmin tools that you use every day.\n\n1720\n01:15:41,985 --> 01:15:42,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1721\n01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,310\n>> Beautiful, love MMC's, and\n\n1722\n01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,670\nwe can go further into those guys\nin another one of our sessions,\n\n1723\n01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:51,000\nbecause this is what I use to\n>> To delegate administrative access.\n\n1724\n01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,220\nRight?\nWe're talking about remote administration.\n\n1725\n01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:56,910\nI've got somebody that's responsible for\nmy DNS servers.\n\n1726\n01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:59,790\nSo, I would make them a custom console,\njust like this,\n\n1727\n01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:04,250\nput it on their desktop for them, and\nnow they have the ability to manage DNS.\n\n1728\n01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,830\nWithout having to give them permission to\nremotely desktop into those servers, or\n\n1729\n01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:10,210\ngive them a key to the server closet, or\n\n1730\n01:16:10,210 --> 01:16:12,910\nmake them the domain admin or\nanything like that.\n\n1731\n01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:16,150\nVery very handy, these custom consoles.\n\n1732\n01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:21,790\nYou can tell I'm a fan of the Microsoft\nfamily of consoles right?\n\n1733\n01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,080\nAll right, beautiful.\n\n1734\n01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,280\n>> Fan.\n\n1735\n01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,660\n>> Yeah, I guess that's all\nkind of what we've got for\n\n1736\n01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,150\nwhat we're gonna cover today.\n\n1737\n01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,400\n>> I think we've kind of hit it all.\n\n1738\n01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,900\nI can't think of anything we missed.\n\n1739\n01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,560\nWe talked about the,\nin here, we really went over\n\n1740\n01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,210\nfour different ways that we could\nremotely administer machines.\n\n1741\n01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:42,470\nWe talked about Remote Desktop,\n\n1742\n01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:47,780\nWe talked about the custom consoles\nas far as like GUI interfaces go.\n\n1743\n01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:51,140\nThen we talked about WinRM\nfrom our command line,\n\n1744\n01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,685\nand we talked about\nPowerShell from PowerShell.\n\n1745\n01:16:54,685 --> 01:16:56,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n1746\n01:16:56,170 --> 01:17:00,380\nreally that's it\n>> The only thing maybe is when you're\n\n1747\n01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:07,530\ntrying to decide what tool you want to\nuse, yeah, just whichever one you prefer.\n\n1748\n01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:10,770\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> It, honestly, is the best thing to use.\n\n1749\n01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:13,795\n>> Maybe if you're coming as a, like-\n>> Certain policies or\n\n1750\n01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,325\nprocedures use this tool.\n\n1751\n01:17:16,325 --> 01:17:18,045\nOr if you have a common\nissue on your computer,\n\n1752\n01:17:18,045 --> 01:17:20,215\nmaybe it's already chosen for you.\n\n1753\n01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:24,405\n>> And you might not have permissions\nto remote desktop into that machine.\n\n1754\n01:17:24,405 --> 01:17:25,835\nSo, then your choices are limited.\n\n1755\n01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:27,480\nNow, you're going to be\nusing a Custom console.\n\n1756\n01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:31,390\nSo, yeah, it really depends on\nwhat you're trying to accomplish.\n\n1757\n01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:34,790\nBut now you've got a plethora\nof choices to choose from.\n\n1758\n01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:35,610\nPick your favorite.\n\n1759\n01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:36,200\nTry them all.\n\n1760\n01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:36,910\nPlay with all of them.\n\n1761\n01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:38,310\nYou are gonna need to know them for\nthe exam.\n\n1762\n01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,620\nSo.\n\n1763\n01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,780\n>> Check them all out.\n\n1764\n01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:41,350\n>> Yup.\n\n1765\n01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,410\nWell, Mike, that's all I got today.\n\n1766\n01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:43,980\nA fun one, right?\n\n1767\n01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:44,810\n>> It's been a blast.\n\n1768\n01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:45,850\n>> Remoting into things.\n\n1769\n01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,520\n>> Yeah, it's good stuff.\n\n1770\n01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,030\n>> Good stuff.\n\n1771\n01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,560\n>> So yeah, all right.\n\n1772\n01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,090\nWell, I guess that wraps\nup the show today.\n\n1773\n01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:52,800\n>> All right.\n>> We've got\n\n1774\n01:17:52,800 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,170\nWe're, we're jumping in today\nwith another of our, our little,\n\n4\n00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,950\nour shorter special segments as\nwe go through an update our exam\n\n5\n00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,110\nobjectives to reflect some of the new\nthings that were added in January 2014.\n\n6\n00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,030\nIf you're not already aware, the exam's\nbeen updated to reflect Windows 8.1,\n\n7\n00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,920\nand while we had planned for\nthat early on.\n\n8\n00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,628\n>> Right.\n>> You know, all of our shows we use\n\n9\n00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:34,810\nWindows 8, 8.1\n>> They did sneak in a few new objectives.\n\n10\n00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,040\nSo we're doing little segments like\nthis just to cover those things\n\n11\n00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,980\nto make sure you're not blindsided or\nsurprised by anything when you\n\n12\n00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,680\nsit down in-\n>> Yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,340\n>> That exam booth.\n\n14\n00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,030\nSo our first segment that we're\ngoing to hit is the idea of\n\n16\n00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,160\nwhat we call remote assistance for us.\n\n17\n00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,350\nNow, if you've already been working with\nWindows 8 in a corporate environment.\n\n18\n00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,850\nYou may actually think about\nthe idea of a remote desktop.\n\n19\n00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,260\nWhich is probably what most\nof us actually think about.\n\n20\n00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,176\nBut we're with remote desktop when I\nactually take over someone's compute,r\n\n21\n00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:02,315\nthat's what I'm I'm doing.\n\n22\n00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:06,015\nI literally kick that person off and\nI may fix something and\n\n23\n00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:07,811\nthen call them back and\nhey, I, I fixed it.\n\n24\n00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:09,095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But they may not\n\n25\n00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:10,995\nactually be able to show\nyou what the issue is.\n\n26\n00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:13,735\nSo I may have to log off a couple\nof times or he kicks me off, and\n\n27\n00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:15,397\nthen we end up having this battle.\n\n28\n00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:19,967\nBut with remote assistance,\nwe can both be signed on at the same time.\n\n29\n00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:23,509\n>> Yeah, remote assistance, it was\noriginally introduced in Windows Vista,\n\n30\n00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:25,807\nwhich is kind of funny\nthat it's a new objective.\n\n31\n00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:28,397\nIt was introduced in Windows Vista.\n\n32\n00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:31,517\nAnd the idea was that there were a lot of\nhelp desks out there doing exactly what\n\n33\n00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:34,157\nRonnie was saying, using remote\ndesktops to help their people.\n\n34\n00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:37,460\nSomebody calls in, they have a problem,\nyou remote desktop in.\n\n35\n00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,610\nThe problem though was you couldn't\nsee the desktop at the same time.\n\n36\n00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,170\n>> Remote assistance solves that problem.\n\n38\n00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,670\nIt is a service that is running inside\nof Windows that allows the end user and\n\n39\n00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,490\nthe remote administrator to be able to\nsee the same screen at the same time.\n\n40\n00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,755\nAnd let me tell ya,\nit makes all the difference.\n\n41\n00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:56,361\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because,\n\n42\n00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,270\ngetting the end user to\nshow you the problem.\n\n43\n00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,890\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Because, you know,\n\n44\n00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,480\na lot of times they just\ncan't put it into words.\n\n45\n00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,585\nIt's broken, it doesn't work.\n\n46\n00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:04,050\n>> Yeah.\n>> I wont, what does it mean?\n\n47\n00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,700\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n48\n00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,990\n>> Can you show me?\n\n49\n00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,420\nAnd you can watch their screen,\nas they launch a program, and do that.\n\n50\n00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,060\nNow, if you're in the same building,\nyou just walk right over and\n\n51\n00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,350\nlook at their screen, right.\n\n52\n00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,040\nBut if they're in another state,\nanother country, it's extremely useful\n\n53\n00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,360\nto be able to see what they're seeing,\nhave them recreate the problem,\n\n54\n00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,960\nand then they can see how you fix it, so\nagain they, they benefit from that, too.\n\n55\n00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a great technology.\n\n56\n00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,815\nIt wasn't the best in\nWindows Vista though, and\n\n57\n00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,355\nwe'll see why here in a few minutes,\nbut it's one of those technologies that\n\n58\n00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,714\ncontinue to evolve and\ncontinue to get better.\n\n59\n00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:37,345\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> It's main benefit for us again,\n\n60\n00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:40,065\nis not only the ability to\nhave them show it to us, but\n\n61\n00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:43,950\nwe also have the ability to communicate\nwith them, usually through a chat window.\n\n62\n00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,660\nSo that way, we can interact with them and\n\n63\n00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,350\nask them what they're\nactually really seeing.\n\n64\n00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,925\nAnd they can provide for us actually\nagain live if you wanna call it that way.\n\n65\n00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:57,280\nLive interaction or the idea of yes,\nthat's exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n66\n00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,145\nAnd then you can even take over the\ncontrol of their desktop if you want to.\n\n67\n00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:04,550\n>> And so, before we jump right into it,\nlet, let's talk about why I\n\n68\n00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,520\ndidn't like it in Vista and what's\nnew that makes it better, all right?\n\n69\n00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,600\nSo in the earlier the implementations in,\nin Vista and\n\n70\n00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,740\nWindows 7 remote\nassistance work like this.\n\n71\n00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,570\nIf I had a problem and\nI wanted Ronnie to help me right, I,\n\n72\n00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,430\nI can't figure something out.\n\n73\n00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,830\nI would create a remote\nassistance invitation, and\n\n74\n00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,580\nan invitation was just a file and\n\n75\n00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,210\nit would basically contain access\ncredentials to well access my machine.\n\n76\n00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,180\nI would then need to send him\nthat file either via email or\n\n77\n00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,875\nvia network file share.\n\n78\n00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A USB key.\n\n79\n00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,640\nI would have to get that\nfile to him somehow.\n\n80\n00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,550\n>> Right.\n>> All right?\n\n81\n00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,320\nAnd once he had that, he could accept the\ninvitation and connect up to my screen.\n\n82\n00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,530\nWell, that act of transmitting the file,\n\n83\n00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,050\nthat turned out to be a little more-\n>> Yeah.\n\n84\n00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,780\n>> Than what most end users could handle.\n\n85\n00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,100\nSo it wasn't the most terribly\nconvenient thing on the planet.\n\n86\n00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,430\nSo what Microsoft did is in Windows 8\nthey introduced, well actually they,\n\n87\n00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,595\nthey introduced this in Windows 7.\n\n88\n00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:00,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n89\n00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,570\n>> Something called Easy Connect.\n\n90\n00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,510\nAnd in Windows 8 and\n8.1 they've made it a little bit better.\n\n91\n00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,170\nAnd easy connect eliminates\nthe need to exchange that file.\n\n92\n00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,490\nInstead it allows the two machines\nto find each other on the network.\n\n93\n00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,960\nAnd when they do that,\n\n94\n00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,010\nthen they can connect up without\nhaving to exchange that file.\n\n95\n00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,680\nIt's one less thing for\nthe end user to do.\n\n96\n00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,650\nAnd if they're not very technically savvy,\nthat, that's pretty valuable.\n\n97\n00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,512\n>> Oh yeah, that more.\n\n98\n00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:26,390\n>> All right, so\nlet's take a look at remote assistance and\n\n99\n00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,080\nkind of see how it works.\n\n100\n00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,690\nAll right?\n\n101\n00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,390\nSo let's say that I'm\nsitting on this machine and\n\n102\n00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,920\nI've got my baby blue background\nhere which is an eyesore.\n\n103\n00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,150\n>> Nice.\n>> But,\n\n104\n00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,940\nbasically I'm working on this machine and,\nand something is just not working, right?\n\n105\n00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,090\nAnd maybe, I'm, I'm trying to\nget to a website, and I'm like,\n\n106\n00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,420\nman, that website is down, but it turns\nout I'm just spelling it wrong, right?\n\n107\n00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,550\nSo, maybe I wanna go to CNN.com,\nand I type in an extra N, you know,\n\n108\n00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,150\nand I shouldn't do this live during the\nshow, cuz you know what's gonna happen.\n\n109\n00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,045\nThis is gonna be porno or something crazy.\n\n110\n00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, let me, in fact,\n\n111\n00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,950\nlet me just change this to\nsomething I know is not valid.\n\n112\n00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,080\nHere.\nSo I'll go to CNN.com, and\n\n113\n00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,070\nI'm just putting an extra n in the name.\n\n114\n00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,060\nAll right.\n\n115\n00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,410\nWell, it's gonna try and\nget out there to that site.\n\n116\n00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,570\nAnd that site's not\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n117\n00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,150\n>> Gonna exist 'cause it's got a typo.\n\n118\n00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,060\nSo it's gonna fail.\n\n119\n00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,410\nAnd maybe I call the help desk.\n\n120\n00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,030\nI'm like hey, I can't get to CNN.\n\n121\n00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,545\nI think our internet is down,\n>> Right.\n\n122\n00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:19,180\n>> Right, 'cause this is,\nthis is what end users do.\n\n123\n00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,503\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And as a help desk tech,\n\n124\n00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:23,494\nyou might listen to them and\nsay, all right, well let me,\n\n125\n00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:24,488\nlet me check on my computer.\n\n126\n00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:27,420\nI don't know, I can get to CNN just\nfine and so you tell them, hey, I,\n\n127\n00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,180\nI think that it's up, you know?\n\n128\n00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,105\nAnd they say, nope, nope,\ninternet connection is down.\n\n129\n00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:33,720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n130\n00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,930\n>> All right, so, so now we need some\nway to take a look at their computer.\n\n131\n00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,250\n>> And so\nwe can either walk them through this or\n\n132\n00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,110\nthey might already know it on their end.\n\n133\n00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,030\nThey can create a remote\nassistance invitation.\n\n134\n00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,830\nNow, remote assistance\nis turned on by default.\n\n135\n00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,280\nRemote desktop really easy to\nget these configured confused.\n\n136\n00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,660\nRemote desktop is not\nturned on by default.\n\n137\n00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,415\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n138\n00:05:55,415 --> 00:06:01,030\n[SOUND] I'm just gonna do\na a quick search here.\n\n139\n00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,230\nI'm typing remote in my search box.\n\n140\n00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,220\nAnd you'll see allow remote\nassistance turns up.\n\n141\n00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,275\nThis is how I find it,\nwhich is quick and easy.\n\n142\n00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:12,540\nIf, if you don't know it that way, you\ncan you can go into your control panel.\n\n143\n00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,270\nAnd it's inside of the system control\npanel, so like if we go into system and\n\n144\n00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,180\nsecurity and then, in here, if we go into.\n\n145\n00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,920\nLet's see, where's the link\nthat takes me into the system?\n\n146\n00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,590\n>> You have to go to\nadministrative tools I believe.\n\n147\n00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,290\n>> Is it buried in there?\n\n148\n00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,140\n>> I think so.\n\n149\n00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,260\nYep.\n>> And then system configuration.\n\n150\n00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,142\n>> Well, no.\nI'm lying to you.\n\n151\n00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,380\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It's not in there.\n\n152\n00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,780\n>> Wow, I'll tell you the other way.\n\n153\n00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,810\nSo you can just right click on this PC and\nchoose Properties.\n\n154\n00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,870\nAnd, and when we get in here you'll\nsee the remote settings option there.\n\n155\n00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,450\n>> That's right.\n\n156\n00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,490\n>> It is in the control panel.\n\n157\n00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> Somewhere.\n\n158\n00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,240\nI just don't remember where.\n\n159\n00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,160\nAnd you'll see here where remote desktop.\n\n160\n00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,490\nOh, we, we've actually turned\nit on in these machines.\n\n161\n00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,610\n>> Yep.\n>> Remote desktop is normally set to do\n\n162\n00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,035\nnot allow remote connections\nto this computer.\n\n163\n00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,950\n>> That, that's the default.\n\n165\n00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,060\nBut allow remote assistance\nconnections is turned on by default.\n\n166\n00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,710\nAnd there's not all that much\nthat we configure with it.\n\n167\n00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,370\nYou'll see if I go into a advance,\nit just says, allow this computer.\n\n168\n00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,780\nLet, let me zoom in a bit on that.\n\n169\n00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,820\nSo allow this computer to be\ncontrolled remotely is turned\n\n170\n00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,510\non\n>> Hum.\n\n171\n00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,590\n>> And then, the maximum amount of time\nthat invitations can remain open is set\n\n172\n00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,710\nto six hours.\n\n173\n00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,360\nSo, when we send that invitation file,\n\n174\n00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,620\nthe person on the other end has six\nhours to accept it before it expires.\n\n175\n00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,140\n>> Yeah.\n\n176\n00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,230\nNow, this is kind of a weird, I,\nI wouldn't say benefit but it may be,\n\n177\n00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,933\nit may not be.\n\n178\n00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:30,460\nSometimes, if you actually do this,\nright, you set it to six hours.\n\n179\n00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,590\nWell, in the midst of that time,\nif they go ahead and they respond,\n\n180\n00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,630\nit could be at that point, even though\nyou're in the middle of doing something,\n\n181\n00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,810\nthey might respond right then.\n\n182\n00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,510\nAnd then, you actually have to\neither accept the you know,\n\n183\n00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,250\nthe fact that the other side is connecting\nin or are you rejected at that point?\n\n184\n00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,650\nSometimes you could actually see where\nthe person's already figured it out.\n\n185\n00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,750\nIt's just that they left this window\nat the default of 6 hours and\n\n186\n00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,485\nthen you connect and\nthen you're interrupting them.\n\n187\n00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:55,037\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, you may actually have to,\n\n188\n00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:57,898\nyou know, tell your user you may want\nto set it down to an hour or so.\n\n189\n00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:59,888\nIf you don't respond back in an hour then,\nyou know,\n\n190\n00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:01,137\nto try again at some other point.\n\n191\n00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:03,296\nAnd you could set these according to your-\n>> Yeah.\n\n192\n00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:03,819\n>> Corporate policy.\n\n193\n00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:04,480\nYou can write a GPO.\n\n194\n00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,816\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To change the setting or whatever.\n\n195\n00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:08,810\nYou also see that option that\nsays create invitations-\n\n196\n00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,474\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n197\n00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:11,950\n>> That can only be used from computers\nrunning Windows Vista or later.\n\n198\n00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,585\nI think that's funny because remote\nassistance wasn't in Windows XP.\n\n199\n00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:15,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n200\n00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,810\nI don't really know what operating\nsystem they're referring to there.\n\n201\n00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,080\nBut that is basically saying, you know-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n202\n00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,290\n>> Use encryption, right?\n\n203\n00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,050\nThere's a, an encrypted\nstandard that wasn't present or\n\n204\n00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,830\nis not turned on by default.\n\n205\n00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,570\nI think there's some third party\nsoftware out there that can use these.\n\n206\n00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,530\nI've never seen it but\nthat's the only thing I can think of.\n\n207\n00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,180\n>> XP had something that\nwas similar based on it,\n\n208\n00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,190\nbut I don't know if it was\nexactly the same or not.\n\n209\n00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,050\n>> Oh, it did.\n>> Yeah.\n\n210\n00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,110\n>> Well if, if it did, then that may\nbe what it's talking about there, so.\n\n211\n00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,040\nSo anyhow, it is turned on by default so\n\n212\n00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,530\nthere's not much we\nneed to configure here.\n\n213\n00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,210\nAll we need is the end user\nto generate an invitation.\n\n214\n00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,715\nAnd what they can do is they can\njust bring up their start screen and\n\n215\n00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:52,220\ntype in invite.\n\n216\n00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,370\nAnd they'll see right here, invite someone\nto connect to your PC and help you.\n\n217\n00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,250\n>> Yeah.\n>> If they choose that,\n\n218\n00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,410\nit's gonna start a very simple wizard\nthat says what do you want to do?\n\n219\n00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,800\nAre you inviting someone to help you?\n\n220\n00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,080\nOr do you want to help-\n>> That's right.\n\n221\n00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,270\n>> Somebody else.\n\n222\n00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,100\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nsay I'm inviting somebody.\n\n223\n00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,170\nAll right, and now, on this screen,\n\n224\n00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,940\nwe're gonna get-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n225\n00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,880\n>> Two real choices.\n\n226\n00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720\nAll right.\nYou, you'll see\n\n227\n00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,345\nthree choices if you have an email\nclient like Microsoft Outlook installed.\n\n228\n00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:20,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I don't have Microsoft Outlook so\n\n229\n00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,730\nI only get two choices.\n\n230\n00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,350\nBut let's, let, let's look at these.\n\n231\n00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,265\nThe first one is create an invite and\nsave it to a file.\n\n232\n00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:29,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is the old way.\n\n233\n00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,460\nAnd you take this file, and then you\ncan email it to somebody, or sent it on\n\n234\n00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,410\na network share, or put it on a USB key,\nwhatever is it, to allow them to connect.\n\n235\n00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,540\nIt's one of the,\nthe ways that's kinda guaranteed to work.\n\n236\n00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,420\nBecause all the information is\nright there in that file but\n\n237\n00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,505\nit requires some extra steps.\n\n238\n00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:45,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n239\n00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,208\n>> Easy Connect for us is the option\nthat is preferred today in Windows 8.1.\n\n240\n00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,720\nOkay?\nSo, this is the one where you actually\n\n241\n00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720\ncreate this,\nit's really going to generate,\n\n242\n00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,955\nI can't remember what it's like\na 12-character password or something.\n\n243\n00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To actually be able to do this.\n\n244\n00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,830\nBut that's the way that they do prefer\nyou to do this cuz it's easier.\n\n245\n00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,862\nAll you have to do at that point then is\nbe able to give that password over to\n\n246\n00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,970\nwhoever is connected and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n247\n00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,010\n>> Now,\nit sounds like a no-brainer, right?\n\n248\n00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,290\n>> Yeah.\n>> I want to use Easy Connect.\n\n249\n00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,170\n>> Yeah.\nI don't want to generate\n\n250\n00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,650\nan invite file it just connects\nthe machines directly.\n\n251\n00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,540\nBut here's the problem, NAT routers and\n\n252\n00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,825\nfirewalls can get in the way of\nEasy Connect, and they frequently do.\n\n253\n00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:25,470\n[LAUGH] in fact, you know, this is,\nMicrosoft hates us when we say things like\n\n254\n00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,020\nthis, but I don't think I've ever\ngotten Easy Connect to work, and\n\n255\n00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,720\nthat's because Easy Connect\ndepends on two things.\n\n256\n00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,020\nIt depends on PNRP, or\nPeer Name Resolution Protocol,\n\n257\n00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,660\nwhich is something we can use\nto resolve a name to an IP.\n\n258\n00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,490\nOn networks that don't necessarily\nhas DNS servers, all right?\n\n259\n00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,600\nAnd the other thing it requires is UPnP or\nUniversal Plug and Play.\n\n260\n00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,350\nIn other words, when we do Easy Connect,\nour system is going to reach out to our\n\n261\n00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,510\nrouter, or firewall, and say,\nhey can you put a temporary\n\n262\n00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,570\nport redirection in to allow people to\nreconnect to my machine, all right?\n\n263\n00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,360\nIf you're router supports that, or\n\n264\n00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,000\nif your firewall supports that great\nyou can use it, it'll work fine, right?\n\n265\n00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,760\nBut if yours doesn't like\nmine at home doesn't.\n\n266\n00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,770\n>> Yeah.\n>> Then or it does but\n\n267\n00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,540\nI've got it turned off.\n\n268\n00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,510\nSo you know, I don't want software\nopening random ports on my firewall, so\n\n269\n00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,200\nI have it turned off and\na lot of business do that.\n\n270\n00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,120\nIn which case when you try to use and\nuse easy connect It's not gonna be able to\n\n271\n00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,155\nopen those ports, and\nEasy Connect is going to fail.\n\n272\n00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right?\n\n273\n00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,190\nSo the more secure your environment is,\n\n274\n00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,090\nthe less likely Easy Connect\nis going to work.\n\n275\n00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,930\nAnd so, you kind of end up falling\nback to the other two methods,\n\n276\n00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,263\nthe save invitation to a file or\nsent it by email.\n\n277\n00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:35,325\nAnd, you know, just to make we sure we\ncover that one in depth, the send it to\n\n278\n00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:39,665\nemail, if you have a default email client,\nyou know, Mozilla Thunderbird, or\n\n279\n00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:44,387\nMicrosoft Outlook or Udora or\nwhatever crazy program is use these days.\n\n280\n00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:46,527\nIf you've got one of those installed,\nthis button will light up.\n\n281\n00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:49,997\nAnd all it's doing is making the file and\nattaching it to an email.\n\n282\n00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:53,687\nSo it's really the same as the top option,\njust it sees your email client.\n\n283\n00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:55,977\nBut, Easy Connect is\ndefinitely the easiest.\n\n284\n00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:59,850\nKeep in mind, that not just your end but\nthe other end, the helper's end,\n\n285\n00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,575\nhas to support this too.\n\n286\n00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,690\nOkay, if you're both on a local network,\n\n287\n00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,380\nif you're on a corporate network,\nit actually works pretty well.\n\n288\n00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,360\nBut if you're remote, the odds of\nusing Easy Connect is pretty low.\n\n289\n00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n290\n00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,300\n>> All right, so let's you know, I can\ntest it I suppose, and see if it works.\n\n291\n00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,071\nWe can test it I suppose and\nsee if it works.\n\n292\n00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,094\n[LAUGH] we'll give it a shot and\nif it fails,\n\n293\n00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:21,700\nI don't know if it's going to\npass through our firewall.\n\n294\n00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,130\nBut, but I'll choose to use easy connect.\n\n295\n00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,930\nAll right.\n\n296\n00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,700\nAnd here it goes, it's a looking.\n\n297\n00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,080\n>> Nope.\n>> Yeah, right there.\n\n298\n00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,730\nI get my warning that's letting me\nknow Easy Connect is not available.\n\n299\n00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,320\nCan't connect to the global\npeer-to-peer network so my firewall or\n\n300\n00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,500\nmy net router, or whatever, is blocking\nit and that, that's pretty common.\n\n301\n00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n302\n00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,240\nNow, when you face this on the exam,\nright,\n\n303\n00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,850\nyou gotta actually to think\nabout a couple things.\n\n304\n00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,100\nEven though we're talking about remote\nassistance, remember that the link to\n\n305\n00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,680\nactually be able to do this,\nis to invite someone to help you.\n\n306\n00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now I, I don't know why they do that.\n\n307\n00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,720\nWhy they actually say,\nit's really remote assistance,\n\n308\n00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000\nbut the way that you find the actual\ncommand is, just use invite.\n\n309\n00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120\nIn the search here.\n\n310\n00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,300\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, it can be a little bit of\n\n311\n00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,150\na disconnect there.\n\n312\n00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,440\nMake sure you go through this\noption when preparing for the exam.\n\n313\n00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,950\nAll right, so I'll go and\nsave my invitation as a file and so\n\n314\n00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,640\nit's gonna generate a little invite file.\n\n315\n00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,290\nI'll put it on my desktop so\nI can find it.\n\n316\n00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,050\nI'll just call it\n>> Yeah.\n\n317\n00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,670\n>> Invitation.\n\n318\n00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,640\nAnd we'll save that and\n\n319\n00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,409\nthen the invitation file has a password\nand that's what it's showing right here.\n\n320\n00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:20,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,830\n>> Is the password that I'm gonna need and\nnow it's sitting here and\n\n322\n00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,330\nit's running, okay.\n\n323\n00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,540\nNow the reason there's a password also\nis you're going to send them this file.\n\n324\n00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,000\nWhat if somebody intercepts the file?\n\n325\n00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,760\n>> Yep.\n>> You don't want just\n\n326\n00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,210\nanybody who has the file\nto be able to use it.\n\n327\n00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,310\nAnd so what you've got to do is,\nis send that file over to the other side.\n\n328\n00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,130\nAnd then when they run it, they'll have to\nprovide this password, and so I've got my,\n\n329\n00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,800\nI'm gonna do this old school,\nI've got my pen and paper right here.\n\n330\n00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,374\nSo I am gonna write down this password\nwhich is not too bad KJZZP8WQ7M68,\n\n331\n00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:50,620\nall right.\n\n332\n00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,260\nAnd now I'm going to copy that file.\n\n333\n00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,500\nNow, I'm on virtual machine so\nI'm somewhat limited in what I can do, but\n\n334\n00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,680\nI'm going to copy the invite and\nI'll send that over to client 2,\n\n335\n00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,100\nwhich I don't know the hostname\non my other machine.\n\n336\n00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,520\nLet me find out its hostname real quick.\n\n337\n00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:21,870\nIt is [INAUDIBLE] [SOUND] but\n\n338\n00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,985\nit does not appear to have\nany shared folders so\n\n339\n00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:34,743\nlets try one of the servers [LAUGH] we\nwill find a machine to copy this to.\n\n340\n00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:35,919\nThere you go I'll temporarily,\n\n341\n00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,355\nI'm going to use my domain name\ncontrollers the network share that is\n\n342\n00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,110\nalways a good security practice\n>> Nice.\n\n343\n00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,680\n>> But so there we go, so\nI have copied it to a network share.\n\n344\n00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,100\nNow, I call up the help desk on the phone\nand I say hey, you know I need some help.\n\n345\n00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,790\nI just put the invitation\nfile in a network share, and\n\n346\n00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,450\nI've got my password ready.\n\n347\n00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,670\nSo now, your help desk person can\njust browse to that network share,\n\n348\n00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,580\nand find the file.\n\n349\n00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,050\nSo I'm going to do that, here's the file.\n\n350\n00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,590\nAnd when they run it, and you could,\n\n351\n00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,770\nI, I could have launched the remote\nassistance and said I'm gonna help\n\n352\n00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,190\nsomebody, but double-clicking on\nthe file takes you right to this screen.\n\n353\n00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,220\n>> Yep.\n>> And now it's asking for, you know,\n\n354\n00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,210\nthe, the password.\n\n355\n00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,810\nAnd so I'll punch in that password.\n\n356\n00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,170\nThe other person would be\nreading this to me on the phone.\n\n357\n00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,797\nAnd so I'll say P, 8, W, Q,\n7, M, 6, 8, there we go.\n\n358\n00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:25,064\nAll right, and now it's gonna connect up.\n\n359\n00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:26,480\nAll right?\n\n360\n00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,390\nAnd when it connects up,\nI'm gonna see the other person's desktop.\n\n361\n00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,880\nNow let me flip over to the other side.\n\n362\n00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,560\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz there's something\n\n363\n00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,290\ngoing on right now.\n\n364\n00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,260\n>> They're waiting for you.\n\n365\n00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,300\nOn their side, yeah,\nthey get a message saying hey,\n\n366\n00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,690\nthat person is trying to connect.\n\n367\n00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,730\nIf you've already figured it out you might\nwant to say no and don't let them connect.\n\n368\n00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,680\nBut I'm gonna say yes, all right?\n\n369\n00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,711\nAnd now I can see your helper can now see\nyour desktop, they can see your desktop,\n\n370\n00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:51,556\nand we've got a little chat\nwindow that we can click on and\n\n371\n00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:54,598\nnow we can start a chat if if\nwe're not on the phone with them.\n\n372\n00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:56,141\n>> Yep.\n\n373\n00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,092\n>> I, the internet is down.\n\n374\n00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,694\nOkay.\n\n375\n00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:00,414\nSo I can tell 'em that.\n\n376\n00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:01,412\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n377\n00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:06,898\n>> Now over on the helper side,\nthe helper sees that chat, right?\n\n378\n00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:09,110\nAnd we'll say,\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n379\n00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,680\n>> type in the left hand side window.\n\n380\n00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,230\nOh, shoot.\n\n381\n00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,700\nThe, a, if, I gotta type in over here.\n\n382\n00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,225\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n383\n00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,670\nAnd so they'll respond back\nwith I don't think so.\n\n384\n00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,170\nAnd,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n385\n00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,540\n>> So, you know, we can start to chat back\n\n386\n00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,820\nand forth.\nAnd what they're seeing, this window, is,\n\n387\n00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,880\nthey're seeing their chat and\ntheir controls up here, and\n\n388\n00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,215\nit's in this central part that they're\nactually seeing the other desktop.\n\n389\n00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:34,695\nAnd by default, they can just see it.\n\n390\n00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,830\n>> Yep.\n>> They can't actually make changes.\n\n391\n00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,550\nIf they want to make changes,\nthey've got to hit request control.\n\n392\n00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,370\nAnd the person on the other\nend will get a prompt.\n\n393\n00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,990\nAnd see I, I can't click on\nthat because I'm just viewing.\n\n394\n00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,560\nBut the person on the other end, they\ngot that message and they can say yes.\n\n395\n00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,600\nAnd now the viewer has or\n\n396\n00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,580\nthe, you know, the helpdesk person, has\naccess to actually control this desktop.\n\n397\n00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,700\n>> Yeah, now this is kinda one of those\ncontention things as the same time.\n\n398\n00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,460\nThe user also has control\nof the desktop and\n\n399\n00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,820\nthe remote assistance person also has it.\n\n400\n00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,360\nSo a lot of times what you do is you\nsay hey I am gonna take control, and\n\n401\n00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,990\nthat way they don't mess\naround with the mouse and\n\n402\n00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,530\nyou are trying to struggle to click\nwhere it goes on every once in a while.\n\n403\n00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,690\nSo, just kinda realize that you may\nhave that every once in a while.\n\n404\n00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,519\nYeah.\nSo now the client, the person who is,\n\n405\n00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,310\nwho's on the other end who is saying, you\nknow, hey, I've got, I've got an issue.\n\n406\n00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,070\nStuff isn't working for me.\n\n407\n00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,050\nThey can say, all right,\nlet me show you the problem.\n\n408\n00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,070\nI fire up my web browser and\nI browse to CNN.com and\n\n409\n00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,440\nI get the page not to be displayed.\n\n410\n00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,785\nObviously, the internet is down.\n\n411\n00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,040\n>> Yep.\n>> Okay?\n\n412\n00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,740\nMeanwhile, back on the helpdesk machine,\nall right, so\n\n413\n00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,890\nhere I am on the helpdesk machine.\n\n414\n00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,100\nThey see that, they see that\nthe person fired up the web browser and\n\n415\n00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,910\nthey can't get to the page.\n\n416\n00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,320\nAnd they can say all right,\nyou know what, let me try.\n\n417\n00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,546\nAnd they can type it in, and\nthey can see the typo real fast.\n\n418\n00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:56,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And they can change it to be correct.\n\n419\n00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,110\nAnd now,\nwe can see if we can actually get there.\n\n420\n00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,590\nAnd I don't remember, does this\nmachine have Internet access Ronnie?\n\n421\n00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,705\n>> I do not know.\n\n422\n00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:04,320\n>> [LAUGH] I guess we'll find that out.\n\n423\n00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,668\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, [LAUGH] if it does have\n\n424\n00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,380\nInternet access, it has extremely slow\n>> Oh.\n\n425\n00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,010\nYeah.\n>> it does it.\n\n426\n00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,680\n>> It's coming in.\n\n427\n00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,320\n>> So, so now we can try it out and\nwhile we're doing this.\n\n428\n00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,660\nWhile we're typing it and\n\n429\n00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,680\nmaking this change, the end user\nif I go back to their machine.\n\n430\n00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,910\nThey're seeing this in real time.\n\n431\n00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> So there they see I've typed in\n\n432\n00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,060\nthe address and, and we're browsing to\nit and albeit extremely slowly we are,\n\n433\n00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,100\nare browsing there.\n\n434\n00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,060\nSo they can get an idea of,\nof yes it's working or\n\n435\n00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,040\nnot it's not, what had to be done\nto fix it and they can see it.\n\n436\n00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,020\nAnd so now the helpdesk person can say\nwell the problem here is that you don't\n\n437\n00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,327\nknow how to type, and, and\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n438\n00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,116\n>> So, you know,\n\n439\n00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,490\nyou can you know, take that how you want.\n\n440\n00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,890\nAnd, and so then you know,\n\n441\n00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,978\nwhen they're done they can then\njust close the session down.\n\n442\n00:18:43,978 --> 00:18:44,640\nAnd that's it.\n\n443\n00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,590\nWe were able to help them.\n\n444\n00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n445\n00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,074\n>> The, the advantage from the assister\nside, from the person that you're offering\n\n446\n00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:54,270\nremote assistance, is that everything that\nthey see through that window is live time.\n\n447\n00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,320\nIn other words,\nthey can see the person, typing.\n\n448\n00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,990\nThey can see that he's,\nyou know, clicking on something.\n\n449\n00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,420\nThey can do everything.\n\n450\n00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,200\nWhile whereas on the other end that\nyou're actually giving the assistance,\n\n451\n00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,180\nyou just wait, and\nthen you see the entire typing, or\n\n452\n00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,080\nwhatever chat that has\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n453\n00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720\n>> Actually come back through to you,\nto help you out.\n\n454\n00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,620\nSo it really does allow\nthem to see even when,\n\n455\n00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,650\nwhen you don't tell them,\noh I didn't realize I made a typo.\n\n456\n00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,190\nThey can actually watch you\nmake the typo and then go oh,\n\n457\n00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,050\nokay I see what the problem\nactually is now and help you.\n\n458\n00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,297\nAnd it makes it feel like a real live time\nresponse instead of somebody just sitting\n\n459\n00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:29,457\nthere dawdling a lot times and\nthen answering after a while.\n\n460\n00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:29,957\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n461\n00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:31,262\n>> And then when the other end closes\n\n462\n00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:33,171\ntheir session down you'll\njust see that message\n\n463\n00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:33,892\nright here.\n>> Yeah.\n\n464\n00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:35,525\n>> It says this session has ended and, and\n\n465\n00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:36,090\nthat's it.\n\n466\n00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,700\nWe're done.\nNo more remote assistance.\n\n467\n00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,140\nNow you're back on your own,\nand you can close out of this.\n\n468\n00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,785\nYou're done with it.\n\n469\n00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:41,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you can work.\n\n470\n00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,222\nYou know, and the end user can terminate\nthe session whenever they want.\n\n471\n00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:44,850\n>> Right.\n>> You know,\n\n472\n00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,650\nRonnie you mentioned the contention side.\n\n473\n00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,233\nIf both sides are trying to use the mouse,\nit's always the local user who wins.\n\n474\n00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:51,360\n>> Yep.\n>> They get the benefit of the doubt.\n\n475\n00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,020\nSo, so, you know,\nthey can cancel session if need be.\n\n476\n00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,710\nSo, that, that that works pretty well.\n\n477\n00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,250\n>> Yeah.\n\n478\n00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,100\n>> You need to remember for the exam.\n\n479\n00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,670\nEasy Connect is the best way to go,\nif your routers and\n\n480\n00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,040\nfirewalls support UPNP and PNRP.\n\n481\n00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,660\n>> Right.\n\n482\n00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,340\n>> If they don't.\n\n483\n00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,560\nWhich a lot of them don't.\n\n484\n00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> If they don't,\n\n485\n00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,680\nthen you're not gonna be able to use that.\n\n486\n00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,770\nAnd you're stuck doing\nthe old invitation file.\n\n487\n00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,629\n>> Hm.\n>> It works.\n\n488\n00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:12,480\n>> Yeah\n>> You know,\n\n489\n00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,830\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n490\n00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,590\nAnd you can send the invitation\nby email or whatever.\n\n491\n00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,100\nThey can run it on their end, punch in\nthe password and they'll be in business.\n\n492\n00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,110\n>> Now Don, just one more question\nbefore we kind of end here.\n\n493\n00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,115\n>> Mhm.\n>> If I send that,\n\n494\n00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:25,300\nlet's say, over to just some other office.\n\n495\n00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,490\nLet's say over in Pensacola.\n\n496\n00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n497\n00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,280\n>> Can they actually connect,\neven across there to help me?\n\n498\n00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,640\nEven if I'm here?\n\n499\n00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,252\n>> They should be able to, yes.\n\n500\n00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:34,374\n>> Okay.\n>> If you've got a,\n\n501\n00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:35,630\na stable firewall\n>> Okay.\n\n502\n00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,620\n>> or a, a stable net router, then,\nthen they should be able to connect.\n\n503\n00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,150\nBut, it can be, you know,\n\n504\n00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,820\nyou can configure a firewall\nto specifically block this.\n\n505\n00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,340\nSo if that's happened,\nthen you may not get through even then.\n\n506\n00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> In which case you're gonna have to rely\n\n507\n00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,740\non something like a VPN tunnel\n>> Yeah.\n\n508\n00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,170\n>> Or, or, you know, something like that,\n\n509\n00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,560\ndirect access, something,\nsomething to be able to get through that.\n\n510\n00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,782\n>> Sounds good.\n\n511\n00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:57,560\n>> All right, so, that's pretty\nmuch it for remote assistance.\n\n512\n00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,840\nRonnie, can you think of anything else?\n\n513\n00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,860\n>> Nope, just like I said.\n\n514\n00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,300\nJust, just make sure you go through it.\n\n515\n00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,430\nBecause, don't let the names trick you.\n\n516\n00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,700\nAnd they'll say which of\nthe following options.\n\n517\n00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,990\nOh, you're going to pick\nremote assistance guy.\n\n518\n00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,700\nNo, you have to remember the invite\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n519\n00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,670\n>> So just make sure you look\n\n520\n00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,900\nthrough those options there.\n\n521\n00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,520\nYeah.\n\n522\n00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,710\n>> All right, so cool feature,\nbeen around since Windows Vista,\n\n523\n00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,780\nmaybe since Windows XP\n>> Yeah.\n\n524\n00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,340\n>> Ronnie was saying.\n\n525\n00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,940\nSo I, I might be off on that one.\n\n526\n00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,685\nBut been around for\na while, it, it's good.\n\n527\n00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:20,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know,\n\n528\n00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,960\na lot of people just use VNC\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n529\n00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,230\n>> Or other software instead,\nbut, but, you know, it is a,\n\n530\n00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,515\na solution that's built into Windows.\n\n531\n00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:26,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you might as well use it.\n\n532\n00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,930\n>> Right.\n>> It's already there.\n\n533\n00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,410\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed that.\n\n534\n00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,550\nStay tuned for more specials as\nwe continue our exam updates and\n\n535\n00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,700\nget everything nice and current, and you\nknow,

00:00:38,379\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:41,046\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\naccompanied by Nate.\n\n5\n00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:42,010\nHow's it going, Nate?\n\n6\n00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,670\n>> Pretty good, Don.\n\n7\n00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,170\nThank for having me on the show.\n\n8\n00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,210\nIt's kind of the other side\nof the table here, so it's-\n\n9\n00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,613\n>> We're all about different things\n\n10\n00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:49,295\ntoday, right?\n\n11\n00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:55,750\nSo Wes is out with a new baby, and so this\nmorning I did a solo show all by myself.\n\n12\n00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,245\n>> Wow.\n>> It was so lonely.\n\n13\n00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:57,750\n>> Right.\n\n14\n00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,270\n>> I missed you, Nate.\n\n15\n00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,198\n>> Aw.\n>> No, not really,\n\n16\n00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:01,730\nit was kind of fun without you.\n\n17\n00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,969\nSo I [LAUGH]\n>> Well, I was looking for\n\n18\n00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,211\nyou on the Steam but you weren't on there,\nso I guess you were-\n\n19\n00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,040\n>> You know, it's funny.\n\n20\n00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,010\nI typically do close my Steam\nclient while we're in a show.\n\n21\n00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,503\nIt's one of the few times, so [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n22\n00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:13,806\nwe're going to have to work on that.\n\n23\n00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,940\n>> That's right.\nI could play some Unreal Tournament\n\n24\n00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,780\nwhile doing the show.\n\n25\n00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,555\nThat's multi-tasking.\n\n26\n00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:24,220\nSpeaking of multi-tasking,\nI hear Windows 8 can do multi-tasking.\n\n27\n00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,380\nAnd that's convenient because\nthis is the Windows 8 show.\n\n28\n00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,630\nHow do you like that tie-in?\n\n29\n00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,160\n>> It was good.\n\n30\n00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,930\n>> You know, I'm all about the segues.\n\n31\n00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,660\n>> But multi-tasking, though,\nwe're going over configuring shared ports.\n\n32\n00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,905\n>> It was more just mentioning Windows 8,\nsee?\n\n33\n00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:40,086\n[LAUGH]\n>> I guess I missed the boat on that one.\n\n34\n00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:40,929\n>> You know,\n\n35\n00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:46,753\nit's because of the high intellectual\nlevel of my transitions, it's.\n\n36\n00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,640\nWell, let's just talk about Windows 8.\n\n37\n00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,680\n>> Okay, today we're talking about\nconfiguring shared resources.\n\n38\n00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,468\nAnd shared resources and stuff,\nmore specifically, shared folders,\n\n39\n00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:04,130\nhome groups, we'll go over home groups,\nfile libraries, which are pretty sweet.\n\n40\n00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,838\nConfiguring shared printers.\n\n41\n00:02:06,838 --> 00:02:08,230\nAnd then SkyDrive.\n\n42\n00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,378\nAnd then last, a little bit about NFC.\n\n43\n00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:14,823\nSo that will be all the cool stuff\nthat we're gonna go over, and\n\n44\n00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:17,580\nmulti-tasking wasn't really in there.\n\n45\n00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,790\nSo that's why I was a little lost on that.\n\n46\n00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,100\n>> You can see all these things.\n\n47\n00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,087\nYou can do two of these at once.\n\n48\n00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,211\nI mean, how awesome would that be?\n\n49\n00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:23,961\n>> We could.\n\n50\n00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:25,720\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n51\n00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,200\nLet's just go ahead and jump right into,\n\n52\n00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,698\nyou wanna start with\nthe folder permissions?\n\n53\n00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,254\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n54\n00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:33,260\nFor shared folder permissions, right?\n\n55\n00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,970\nSo, we've got this thing, NTFS.\n\n56\n00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,809\nWe'll get to that next, but\nthe shared folder permissions, well, NTFS,\n\n57\n00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:42,711\nnot next, but next episode.\n\n58\n00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:43,570\nYeah.\n\n59\n00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,340\nShared portal permissions, right.\n\n60\n00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,962\nWhen sharing something,\nyou can't share an individual file.\n\n61\n00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,630\nIt has to be in a folder, and\nthen sharing the folder, right?\n\n62\n00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,960\nAnd then there's a menagerie of\ndifferent ways to share a folder, right.\n\n63\n00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,400\nYou can share it through\nthe shared folder snap in,\n\n64\n00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,500\nthrough the Microsoft Management console.\n\n65\n00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,003\n>> That's not a good way.\n[LAUGH]\n\n66\n00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:09,523\n>> You can share it through\n\n67\n00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,240\nWindows Explorer.\n\n68\n00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,970\nAnd you can use the net share command,\nthe share folders.\n\n69\n00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,336\nAnd then there's this really easy way,\nto share through a home group.\n\n70\n00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:25,490\nBut before we get into that, yeah,\nlike, home group stuff, and, yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,878\nWe can share a folder and see how it goes.\n\n72\n00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:30,411\n>> Yeah.\nNow, sharing folders is something that\n\n73\n00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,500\na lot of us are gonna do if you\nhave more than one computer.\n\n74\n00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,540\nIf you've only got one computer,\n\n75\n00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,710\nthere's not really a whole heck\nof a lot of point in doing it.\n\n76\n00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,260\nBut if you have, like,\nif you're like at home and you and\n\n77\n00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,380\nyour spouse have a computer and\nyou want to be able to share content.\n\n78\n00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,390\nOr maybe you work in a small office,\nright, and you've got five computers and\n\n79\n00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,300\nyou want to have all of your documents in\none place so they're easy to back up and\n\n80\n00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,190\nrestore.\n\n81\n00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,670\nWhat you can do is you can put all\nyour stuff into a single folder, and\n\n82\n00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,040\nyou can have subfolders under that,\n\n83\n00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,760\nbut you have one main parent folder,\nand then you share that folder.\n\n84\n00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,780\nAnd by sharing, what we mean is,\nmaking it available on the network.\n\n85\n00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,720\nWhen you share a folder on the network,\n\n86\n00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,080\nany of your other computers can\nbrowse over the network to get to it.\n\n87\n00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,580\nIt might be a wireless or a wired network.\n\n88\n00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,440\nBut they can browse to it, read the data,\nwrite to the data, add data, remove data.\n\n89\n00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,840\nDepending on the permissions that we set.\n\n90\n00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,430\nWe have full control over that.\n\n91\n00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,550\nBut we can provide access so\n\n92\n00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,220\nthat everybody can have access\nto centralized resources.\n\n93\n00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,337\nThis is really, really useful,\nespecially in a business environment.\n\n94\n00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:28,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n95\n00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,618\nYeah.\nYep, that's right.\n\n96\n00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:32,213\nWere you gonna say something?\n\n97\n00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:34,380\n>> Nope.\nI was gonna say, that's all I got.\n\n98\n00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,088\nWhat you got?\nYou wanna do it?\n\n99\n00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,420\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n100\n00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,391\nI think as we do it, we can explain\na little bit more about it, like,\n\n101\n00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:44,970\nbasic sharing, advanced sharing,\nthe defaults, right?\n\n102\n00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,990\nSo if you use the basic sharing,\nthe default is everyone read and write.\n\n103\n00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,600\n>> Let's do this.\n\n104\n00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,870\nLet's work through it\nwhile we describe it.\n\n105\n00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,410\nCuz it makes a little more sense.\n\n106\n00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,670\nCuz if you've never seen shared folders,\n\n107\n00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,318\nsome of the stuff doesn't\nnecessarily latch on to that idea.\n\n108\n00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:05,310\nSo, let me, we're gonna do\nthe home group and stuff on, or\n\n109\n00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,840\nyou're gonna create it on your computer.\n\n110\n00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,378\nSo let me do the basic\nfolder share on mine.\n\n111\n00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:10,380\nDoes that sound cool?\n\n112\n00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,460\n>> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n113\n00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,600\n>> So let's pull up my computer,\nJason, and\n\n114\n00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,310\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm just\ngonna browse into my C drive here.\n\n115\n00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,300\nAnd let's say that Nate and\n\n116\n00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,410\nI have some important stuff that we need\nto share between computers, all right?\n\n117\n00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,599\nSo I have a little program\ninstalled called Fraps.\n\n118\n00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:26,390\n>> Nice.\n>> And\n\n119\n00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,600\nsome of you might have heard of that one,\n\n120\n00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,640\nit's really useful if you wanted to, like,\nplay a video game and do a screen grab.\n\n121\n00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,460\nYou know, capture it as a video and\nshare it with somebody.\n\n122\n00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,460\nSo, I've got Fraps, installed and maybe in\nhere is where I store my video files and\n\n123\n00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,020\nthings like that that I wanna share out,\nI wanna give Nate access to, right?\n\n124\n00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,380\nSo I might have a folder\nin here called Videos, and\n\n125\n00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,504\nI might have another folder that's\nScreenshots, and all that good stuff.\n\n126\n00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,030\nRight?\nSo it's all junk that I've got\n\n127\n00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,870\nin here with Fraps.\n\n128\n00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,610\nAnd so I wanna share that out and let Nate\nbe able to access it over the network.\n\n129\n00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,482\nSo the easiest way, I'll start with the\nsuper easy way, the easiest way to do that\n\n130\n00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:08,878\nis just to right-click on the folder,\nand you'll go and see Share with.\n\n131\n00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:10,820\nAnd you can pick who you\nwant to share it with.\n\n132\n00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,020\nNow, we don't have a Home Group just yet.\n\n133\n00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,780\nWe'll get to that a little bit later.\n\n134\n00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,087\nSo, for right now,\nI'm gonna choose Specific people.\n\n135\n00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,653\nAnd when we share it with specific people,\n\n136\n00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:22,935\nthe default permissions that\nNate was talking about,\n\n137\n00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:27,310\nthe default is that administrators\nwill have access to it, and you.\n\n138\n00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,450\nRight, so I'm logged in as me\nwith my Microsoft identity, so\n\n139\n00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,870\nDon Pezet, and then my Live account,\ndonpezet@hotmail.com.\n\n140\n00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,200\nSo you can email me there, I can't\nremember the last time I checked it,\n\n141\n00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,690\nbut it does exist.\n\n142\n00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,590\nSo, [LAUGH] it will not get read.\n\n143\n00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,950\nBut anyhow, you see me, and\nthen you've got read/write.\n\n144\n00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,410\nSo I've got read and write permissions.\n\n145\n00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,628\nNow, Nate mentioned that\nthe default is read only.\n\n146\n00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:56,199\nAnd you don't see that here,\nbut he is absolutely right, and\n\n147\n00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,545\nthis is why I wanted to show you.\n\n148\n00:06:57,545 --> 00:07:01,799\nIf we add somebody else in, and\nit might be somebody specific or\n\n149\n00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,490\nit might be as general as everyone.\n\n150\n00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,236\nAnd I didn't have to type that,\nI could have dropped that box down, and\n\n151\n00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:10,330\neveryone is right there.\n\n152\n00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,270\nIf I want to share with everyone and\nI add it in, there's the default.\n\n153\n00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,820\nWhen we add people by default,\nthey'll able to read.\n\n154\n00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,590\nMaybe I want Nate to be able to access\nmy video captures and my screenshots,\n\n155\n00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,570\nbut I don't want him to be able to delete\nthem, or add his own, or whatever.\n\n156\n00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,890\nI just want to let him read access, right?\n\n157\n00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,226\nSo I can leave it that way, and now he'll\nbe able to browse over the network and\n\n158\n00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:34,711\ngain access to that data.\n\n159\n00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:35,378\nAll right?\n\n160\n00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:36,629\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nhit the Share button.\n\n161\n00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,020\nNow, notice that little shield on there.\n\n162\n00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,660\nIn order to create a file share,\n\n163\n00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,900\nyou have to have administrative\nprivileges on your computer.\n\n164\n00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,560\nIf you're just a regular user,\nyou won't be able to do this, right?\n\n165\n00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,583\nIt'll prompt you for\nadministrator credentials.\n\n166\n00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,840\nNow, usually in a home environment, we\nare an administrator on our own machine.\n\n167\n00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,875\nIn a corporate environment,\nthough, you might not be.\n\n168\n00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,001\nSo I'll go ahead and hit share.\n\n169\n00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,810\nIt's gonna ask whether I want\nto turn on network discovery.\n\n170\n00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,320\nThat's a pretty important piece.\n\n171\n00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,130\nNetwork discovery is turned off by default\nin Windows 8 which means other people\n\n172\n00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,240\ncan't find your computer.\n\n173\n00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,440\nIf you have a shared folder,\nyou need other people to be able to\n\n174\n00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,490\nfind your computer so\nit's something that we'll have to turn on.\n\n175\n00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,090\nIn my case it's not on, so\nI may need to pick and choose.\n\n176\n00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,130\nSo it's saying, do I want to turn on\nnetwork discovery for all public networks.\n\n177\n00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,295\nNow normally we only want\nit on private networks.\n\n178\n00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:32,415\nA public network, that's like when\nyou're at Starbucks, or McDonald's, or\n\n179\n00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:34,865\na hotel where they have\nwireless available for you.\n\n180\n00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:37,625\nAnd you probably don't wanna share with\nthe other patrons that you've never even\n\n181\n00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,595\nmet before.\n\n182\n00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:40,030\nSo I'm gonna say no.\n\n183\n00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,800\nNo doesn't mean that it's not\ngonna turn on network discovery.\n\n184\n00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,420\nNo means it will turn on network\ndiscovery for your private networks, but\n\n185\n00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,120\nnot your public ones.\n\n186\n00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,240\n>> So wait, so your network\nlocation was set to the public?\n\n187\n00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,330\n>> No, mine's set to private.\n\n188\n00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,480\nIt always asks that.\n\n189\n00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,070\nWhen you share that first folder,\nit prompts that like, whether or\n\n190\n00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,130\nnot you want your public networks also.\n\n191\n00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,030\nYou know what,\nI actually have two network cards.\n\n192\n00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,080\nSo maybe my second one is public,\nI don't know.\n\n193\n00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,940\nWe can find out.\n\n194\n00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,500\nHave we ever talked, on this show,\nabout network locations?\n\n195\n00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,670\nDid we already cover that?\n\n196\n00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,270\n>> Yup, yup.\n\n197\n00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,340\nYeah, Me and Mike.\n\n198\n00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,720\n>> So, see I've got two network cards,\nboth of them flagged as private.\n\n199\n00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,990\n>> Okay, sweet.\n\n200\n00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,730\nAll right, so you got your share in there.\n\n201\n00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,740\n>> Now, here's our problem with\nthe way that I just shared it.\n\n202\n00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,660\nNate does not have a user\naccount on my computer.\n\n203\n00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,220\nAnd Windows does not allow\nanonymous access by default.\n\n204\n00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,030\nSo if Nate were to try and\nbrowse over the network to my computer,\n\n205\n00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,240\nit's going to prompt him for\na username and password.\n\n206\n00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,290\nAnd he'll need a username and password on\nmy machine to be able to access that data.\n\n207\n00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,780\nIn a corporate environment,\nyou might have a domain, right?\n\n208\n00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,740\nA centralized user account database.\n\n209\n00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,580\nIf that's the case, then you have\na user account and you gain access and\n\n210\n00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,150\nit's not a big deal.\n\n211\n00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,120\nI could have added Nate specifically.\n\n212\n00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,540\nBut for a home user,\nyou're not gonna have that.\n\n213\n00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,990\nSo that creates a bit of a problem.\n\n214\n00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,770\nAnd we need some kind of work around for\nthat.\n\n215\n00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,930\n>> So you didn't make me\nan account of you computer.\n\n216\n00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:08,550\n>> I can.\n\n217\n00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,900\nWould you like one?\n\n218\n00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,830\n>> You haven't already done it?\n\n219\n00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,340\n>> No.\nNo.\n\n220\n00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,570\nI know what you're up to.\n\n221\n00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,490\nI won't fall for that.\n\n222\n00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:15,990\n>> Look at mine.\n\n223\n00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,970\n>> You created me an account.\n\n224\n00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,620\nBefore, so you could have\naccess to my network shares.\n\n225\n00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,690\n>> Sucker.\n[LAUGH] All right,\n\n226\n00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,300\nso I'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate Nate an account online.\n\n227\n00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,130\nAnd so I'll go into my,\nactually you know what?\n\n228\n00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,710\nI'm in the wrong spot.\n\n229\n00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,450\n>> Whoops.\n\n230\n00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,555\n>> And I'm going to launch finance.\n\n231\n00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:37,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is that a static menu?\n\n232\n00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,590\nFinance always comes up.\n\n233\n00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,678\nNo matter what I search for,\nfinance is always there.\n\n234\n00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:42,579\n>> Yep.\n>> Well, anyway.\n\n235\n00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,730\nAll right, so\nI'm just gonna jump right in here and\n\n236\n00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,720\nI'm gonna create him a user account.\n\n237\n00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,900\nThere's a couple of different\nways to create user accounts and\n\n238\n00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,910\nI'm probably doing it the hard way.\n\n239\n00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,120\nThis is the way that I'm used to because\nit's been in Windows a long time.\n\n240\n00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,730\nYou can go into the computer\nmanagement screen and\n\n241\n00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,620\nyou've got local users in groups.\n\n242\n00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,170\nAnd you can create user\naccounts right here.\n\n243\n00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,390\nI probably should do it the new way,\n\n244\n00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:09,340\nwhich is if we go into our Settings,\nwe've got Users.\n\n245\n00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,685\nAnd if we go in this way,\nthis is the nice new modern UI way, and\n\n246\n00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:18,465\nI can see that I've got a user right here,\nDon Pezet.\n\n247\n00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:19,695\n>> The touch friendly.\n\n248\n00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,505\n>> And here I am using my touch pad,\nwhich I hate.\n\n249\n00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:23,285\nSo I should be using my screen.\n\n250\n00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:25,055\nBut you'll see my user account there.\n\n251\n00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,875\nHey, am I missing it?\n\n252\n00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,035\nWhere's the add user button?\n\n253\n00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:29,825\n>> Down there.\n>> Right\n\n254\n00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,725\nthere at the bottom\nwhere it says add user.\n\n255\n00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:36,320\nSo I can add one in and I'll not do\na Microsoft account for this one.\n\n256\n00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,470\n>> Yeah, a local account.\n\n257\n00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:45,020\n>> The Microsoft account, that's talking\nabout a Live ID, live.com so if somebody\n\n258\n00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,362\ngoes out to Microsoft they can create\nan account so I I'll make one for Nate.\n\n259\n00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,835\n>> Just password all lower case.\n\n260\n00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:52,650\n>> All right.\n>> That will be easy to type.\n\n261\n00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:59,790\n>> Your password can not\ncontain your password.\n\n262\n00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,841\nFunny.\n\n263\n00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:01,341\nSo.\n\n264\n00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,021\nThere we go.\n>> Nice.\n\n265\n00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:07,865\nThat works.\n\n266\n00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:09,786\n>> Is this a child's account?\n\n267\n00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:10,372\nYes it is.\n\n268\n00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:11,051\n>> No Don.\n\n269\n00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:11,690\n>> All right.\n\n270\n00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,253\nAll right.\n\n271\n00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:14,087\nFine.\n[LAUGH]\n\n272\n00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:15,028\n>> [LAUGH] Okay so\n\n273\n00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:19,870\nnow Nate has a password on my system,\na user account and password.\n\n274\n00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,450\nSo in theory, you should be able to browse\nover the network, find my folder and\n\n275\n00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,090\ngain access to it.\n\n276\n00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,640\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n277\n00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,270\n>> Do you want to try it?\n\n278\n00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,600\n>> Here we go.\n\n279\n00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,540\nYup, what I'll do,\nsince you did turn on network discovery.\n\n280\n00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,060\n>> I did, but\nI haven't checked the firewall.\n\n281\n00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,950\nI'm pretty sure it opens that up for\nus, so we'll see.\n\n282\n00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,490\nHopefully that's not an issue.\n\n283\n00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,050\nMy computer is DP laptop.\n\n284\n00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,680\nThere we go.\n>> All right.\n\n285\n00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,050\nI'll double click on that, and now it\nshould connect out to this computer and\n\n286\n00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,460\ndisplay the shares that he has after\nI authenticate to his computer.\n\n287\n00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,610\n>> It's going to think about it for\na little while, isn't it?\n\n288\n00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,125\n>> It is.\nIt's trying.\n\n289\n00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:56,260\n>> [LAUGH]\nAt least we get that status bar,\n\n290\n00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,050\nso we know something is happening,\nbut we don't really know what,\n\n291\n00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,210\nwe don't know how long, but\nsomething is happening.\n\n292\n00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,482\n>> It keeps me interested though.\n\n293\n00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm waiting cuz I know\n\n294\n00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,560\nbetween this amount of\ntime it's gonna connect.\n\n295\n00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,156\n>> The dark little secret of status bars\nis that they don't actually mean anything.\n\n296\n00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:16,600\n[LAUGH] They're not really\nkey of any true status.\n\n297\n00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,690\nIt's just waiting.\n\n298\n00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,900\nThat is taking a long time.\n\n299\n00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,496\n>> It sure is.\n\n300\n00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:22,685\n>> Well, that's good time.\n\n301\n00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,750\nSo what should happen is, there we go!\n\n302\n00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,695\nSo we got prompted and\nI created that user account for you.\n\n303\n00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:30,297\nWhich was just Nate.\n\n304\n00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,456\nAnd the password was just\npassword all lower case.\n\n305\n00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:40,535\nAll right let's see what happens here.\n\n306\n00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:43,970\nSo now it goes into what's called the\nenumeration phase where it tries the list.\n\n307\n00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,240\nAll the stuff that's\nshared out of my system.\n\n308\n00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,930\nI might have share folders,\nI might have shared printers, right?\n\n309\n00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,340\nSo there's different things\nthat I can share out.\n\n310\n00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,990\nIt should find those and\nlist those at neck breaking speed,\n\n311\n00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,530\nthis is really impressive.\n\n312\n00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,286\nThere we go!\n\n313\n00:13:58,286 --> 00:13:59,018\nAll right.\n\n314\n00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:01,134\n>> [LAUGH] My heavens.\n\n315\n00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:05,570\n>> So yeah, I almost couldn't\nstand the rapidness of that.\n\n316\n00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,830\nSo there it is, you got my videos and\nmy screenshots folder.\n\n317\n00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,720\nAnd remember that I only\ngave him read permission.\n\n318\n00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,615\nSo if he tries to create something,\naccess denied.\n\n319\n00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:16,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n320\n00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,990\nAll right.\n\n321\n00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,850\nWell, sweet.\nWell thanks.\n\n322\n00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,510\nSo there we go.\n\n323\n00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,600\nBasic sharing.\n\n324\n00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,880\nWe can get into the advanced sharing and\ngive me read and write privileges.\n\n325\n00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,870\n>> I guess I could do that.\n\n326\n00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,960\nAll right.\nSo\n\n327\n00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,920\nI'm gonna compromise\nsecurity on my laptop and\n\n328\n00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,265\nI'm gonna bump Nate's permissions up,\nright?\n\n329\n00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:38,470\n[LAUGH] So what I'm gonna do, is I'm\ngonna go back on my hard drive here,\n\n330\n00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,190\nand I'm gonna browse right\nback to that fraps folder.\n\n331\n00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,510\nAnd with the basic sharing,\nthat's where you go to share with, and\n\n332\n00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,510\nspecific people, and that's designed\nto be really simple, easy for\n\n333\n00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,650\npeople who don't really know Windows.\n\n334\n00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,710\nBut if I go down to properties,\nI can pull up the properties.\n\n335\n00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,930\nAnd I've got this sharing tab.\n\n336\n00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,070\nAnd the sharing tab is where\ni'll see that it shared, and\n\n337\n00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,560\ni'll have the advanced sharing button.\n\n338\n00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,440\nAnd that's where the real power is, for\n\n339\n00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,090\nthose of us that really wanna\nget in there and be granular.\n\n340\n00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,170\nWe can jump in, and\n\n341\n00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,290\nwe can start to see things like, we can\nshare the folder with more than one name.\n\n342\n00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,880\nWe can restrict how many people can\nconnect simultaneously if you're really\n\n343\n00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,380\npopular.\n\n344\n00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,910\nNotice how the limit the number of\nsimultaneous users to twenty is set.\n\n345\n00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,740\nThat's the default for Windows 8.\n\n346\n00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,410\nSo if you share something\nout it does limit you.\n\n347\n00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,630\nWindows Vista and\nearlier used to be ten so\n\n348\n00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,040\nyou had even less people\nthat could connect.\n\n349\n00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,970\nI'm gonna go into permissions though.\n\n350\n00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,820\nAnd here's where I can see\nwhere I shared it out,\n\n351\n00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,369\nwhere everyone has full control and\nadministrative,\n\n352\n00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:41,910\nactually, it's because I did it in basic,\nso the basic stuff isn't showing here.\n\n353\n00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,150\nSo I'm going to add you in here.\n\n354\n00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,670\nSo I'm going to add in Nate,\nand I can give him just read,\n\n355\n00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,900\nthere's that default that we saw before,\nor I'm going to give him full control.\n\n356\n00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,146\nI'm gonna give him the whole thing.\n\n357\n00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:55,042\n>> Nice.\n\n358\n00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500\n>> All right.\n\n359\n00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,625\nAnd so now that's changed.\n\n360\n00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,208\nNow.\n\n361\n00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,000\nI didn't actually make any\nchanges to Nate's account.\n\n362\n00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,458\nI just gave him some permissions.\n\n363\n00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,850\nSo he should be able to just\ngo right in and get to work.\n\n364\n00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,962\nSo, let's see.\n\n365\n00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:12,260\nLet's switch back over to Nate's computer,\nand see what happens.\n\n366\n00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,736\n>> Now, that read and\n\n367\n00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:19,280\nwrite that you just granted to me is\ngonna be just on this shared folder.\n\n368\n00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,620\nSo, if you just create a new share,\nthen I'll have the read, or\n\n369\n00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,540\nwhatever you decide to\nchoose it on that one.\n\n370\n00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,170\n>> Absolutely, yeah, and\nyou might want that.\n\n371\n00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,200\nIf you have an employee handbook folder,\n\n372\n00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,300\nyou might want that to be read only for\neveryone.\n\n373\n00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,165\nBut then you might have a documents\nfolder that you want people to be\n\n374\n00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:33,909\nable to read and write to.\n\n375\n00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:38,025\nNate, you might need to disconnect and\n\n376\n00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:41,679\nreconnect to that share before\nthat change takes effect.\n\n377\n00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:51,708\nWindows, once it connects,\nit does some caching that it does,\n\n378\n00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:56,313\nand when you do that,\nit can sometimes retain those\n\n379\n00:16:56,313 --> 00:17:00,510\npermissions even though it's been changed.\n\n380\n00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,353\nSo In an extreme instance,\nyou might have to reboot.\n\n381\n00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:05,814\n>> Aw.\n\n382\n00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,020\n>> Well, here.\n\n383\n00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,378\nLet me.\n\n384\n00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,803\nThere.\n\n385\n00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:11,523\nWhy don't you give it a shot now?\n\n386\n00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,904\nI just turned off the basic part.\n\n387\n00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,390\nLet's see.\n\n388\n00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,212\nLet's see what happens here.\n\n389\n00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:25,753\nLooks promising.\n\n390\n00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,250\nHey!\n\n391\n00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,670\nThere we go.\n\n392\n00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,935\nNow he's able to write, he was able to\ncreate a folder, and he's in business.\n\n393\n00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:32,535\nOkay.\nSo\n\n394\n00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:37,385\nthat kind of showed you the basic sharing,\nand it showed you the advanced sharing,\n\n395\n00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:42,114\nright, where you actually get in there\nreal granular to set those permissions.\n\n396\n00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:43,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n397\n00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,570\nYep.\nNow, all right.\n\n398\n00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,240\nSo, yeah.\n\n399\n00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,640\nThere's those sharing ways.\n\n400\n00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,149\nNow, there is a way that we can\nautomatically share things, more or\n\n401\n00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,757\nless, or sort of just a bit easier, and\n\n402\n00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:59,051\nthat's something through\nthe wonderful world of home groups.\n\n403\n00:17:59,051 --> 00:17:59,632\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n404\n00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:03,454\nYeah, so what we just saw is pretty cool,\nbut, I mean, you guys saw it,\n\n405\n00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:07,310\nit's a lot of steps, and for\na home user, it's not really ideal.\n\n406\n00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,790\nSo the home group is perfect.\n\n407\n00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,210\nJust the first thing to mention,\n\n408\n00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,040\nthough, it is called a home group cuz\nit's designed to work for home networks.\n\n409\n00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,970\nIf you have a business network,\nit's not designed to function that way.\n\n410\n00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,690\nAnd if you're joined to a domain,\n\n411\n00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,710\nyou actually won't be able to\nparticipate in that home group.\n\n412\n00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,821\nThey were gonna make\na change to that in 8.1.\n\n413\n00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,430\nDo you know if they did?\n\n414\n00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,960\n>> I don't.\nI'm not sure.\n\n415\n00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,620\n>> They were saying in 8.1 that they were\ngoing to make it where if you were on\n\n416\n00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,730\na domain,\n\n417\n00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,780\nthat when you got onto a separate network\nthat you could join a home group.\n\n418\n00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,171\nI don't know if they actually put\nthat into production, though.\n\n419\n00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:37,809\nBut in the regular version of Windows 8,\nyou can't.\n\n420\n00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,413\nSo just keep in mind,\nif you're joined to a corporate network,\n\n421\n00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,070\nyou may not be able to use the home group.\n\n422\n00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,685\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n423\n00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:44,690\nYeah.\n\n424\n00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,514\nSo your network location\nhas to be set on private,\n\n425\n00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:49,946\nright, and\nyou have to be on the home type.\n\n426\n00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:54,350\nWhen you connect to a network, you'll be\nprompted the first time you connect to it.\n\n427\n00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,212\nAnything other than home, you'll be\nunable to create or join a home group.\n\n428\n00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:03,830\nOne of those things that\nthey say not to do.\n\n429\n00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n430\n00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,560\nIt's one of those things where if\nyou're in a corporate environment,\n\n431\n00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,490\nthey want you to buy a Windows server.\n\n432\n00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,880\nThey want you to use a Windows server\nas your file share and all that.\n\n433\n00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,770\nSo they tried to make it where home\ngroups would not be very effective in\n\n434\n00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,740\nthe workplace.\n\n435\n00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,750\nThe other thing is,\nhome groups are built entirely upon IPv6.\n\n436\n00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,800\nSo they require an IPv6\ncommunication between your systems.\n\n437\n00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,818\nMost corporate networks are segmented and\ndon't support IPv6 routing, and so\n\n438\n00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:31,370\nhome groups wouldn't work\nin that layout anyway.\n\n439\n00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,961\nSo that's further reason for\nthem to cripple it and\n\n440\n00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:36,045\nmake it only work in a home environment.\n\n441\n00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:39,620\n>> Mm-hm.\nYou know, I just thought of something.\n\n442\n00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,820\nAnother easy way to share something is\ndropping it into your Public folder.\n\n443\n00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,710\nIf you are turning on public sharing and,\ngoodness.\n\n444\n00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,480\nThe public folders, right,\neveryone's got one, and\n\n445\n00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,060\nit's kind of like an open locker,\nmore or less.\n\n446\n00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,549\nYou can just drop it on there, and as long\nas you have enabled sharing of your public\n\n447\n00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:03,454\nfolder, anybody who is on that network\ncan get to your public folder and\n\n448\n00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,299\nget there and get that stuff out.\n\n449\n00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:11,661\n>> You know, I always forget about those,\nbecause I don't really make use of them.\n\n450\n00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:12,997\n[LAUGH] I usually.\n\n451\n00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:16,125\n>> Yeah.\nI don't know anybody who really does,\n\n452\n00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:21,940\nI guess, but it is convenient if it\nserved the purpose that you were after.\n\n453\n00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,430\n>> Yeah, so let's say, for\nexample, that you had all of your,\n\n454\n00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,160\nI'm trying to think of something legal.\n\n455\n00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,220\n[LAUGH] All right, screw it, let's say you\nhave your music library on your computer,\n\n456\n00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:39,080\nright, and you want it so that if guests\ncome over, in full compliance with ASCAP\n\n457\n00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,250\nand the music recording industry, that you\nwant to share your music with them, but\n\n458\n00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,340\nyou don't want to have to\ncreate user accounts and so on.\n\n459\n00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,540\nYou can take your public music library.\n\n460\n00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,600\nAnd you've got a couple of them.\n\n461\n00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,610\nWhat do you have by default?\n\n462\n00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,930\nYou have public documents,\npublic music, public videos?\n\n463\n00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,100\nAnd public-\n>> Pictures.\n\n464\n00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100\nYep.\n>> Okay.\n\n465\n00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,920\nSo you can throw the stuff into\none of those public folders,\n\n466\n00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,160\nthe media type doesn't really matter,\nthe names are just for organization,\n\n467\n00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,010\nbut you can throw them\nin the right folder.\n\n468\n00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:09,430\nAnd then when someone else visiteds,\nvisiteds, when somebody visits your house,\n\n469\n00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,000\nI'm just gonna create all new verbs,\nwhen they visit your house,\n\n470\n00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,390\nthey'll be able to browse into that public\nfolder and access your data without having\n\n471\n00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,990\nto muck around with user names and\npasswords and all that good stuff.\n\n472\n00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,170\nIt's public, thus the name.\n\n473\n00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,999\n>> Yeah, and based on your network\nlocation, you can turn on,\n\n474\n00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:32,170\nyou can have those sharing to\nthe public folders on or off.\n\n475\n00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,460\nIf you were to go to a coffee house or\n\n476\n00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,700\nsomething, then you could have\nthe sharing public folders turned off.\n\n477\n00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,695\nWhen you're at home on the private\nnetwork, it can be turned on, so\n\n478\n00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:49,210\nit's not always open to everybody\nbased off your network location.\n\n479\n00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,100\n>> Do you want to demonstrate\nthe public folders?\n\n480\n00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,050\nWe've only got a few minutes left on this\nsegment, so we probably don't have time to\n\n481\n00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,130\nhome groups until the next segment, so\nwhy don't you show the public folders?\n\n482\n00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,340\n>> All right, yeah, sure.\n\n483\n00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,170\nAll right, the easiest way to\nget there for me is through,\n\n484\n00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,380\nyou have Windows Explorer,\nand here we are.\n\n485\n00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,450\nLet's see, that's Don's computer there.\n\n486\n00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,601\nWe're gonna go into My Libraries,\nand we'll go into to the Documents.\n\n487\n00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:20,435\nAnd so there's My Documents, right?\n\n488\n00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:23,445\nSo these are my, I guess,\npersonal documents, whatnot.\n\n489\n00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:26,915\nAnd then there are the public documents.\n\n490\n00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:32,601\nAnd in Public Documents,\nI'll just create a folder in here for\n\n491\n00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:36,260\nDon, and we'll say, My Screenshots.\n\n492\n00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,624\nSo those are ones of all my wicked\ncool games that I will put in there.\n\n493\n00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:43,290\nAnd then that's it.\n\n494\n00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,680\nUnless I have,\nis public sharing turned on or off?\n\n495\n00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,510\nI'll check that real quick.\n\n496\n00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,393\nNetwork and Sharing Center > Advanced\nSharing, under my private profile.\n\n497\n00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:01,909\nAnd yep, it should be on,\nso it should be good.\n\n498\n00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:04,900\nAll right, Don.\n\n499\n00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,343\nOh, that's right, your account.\n\n500\n00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:10,750\nI think-\n>> Don't worry about it.\n\n501\n00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,170\nI was going to browse to Nate's computer,\nbut\n\n502\n00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,580\nI forgot that he had created an account\nfor me, and so it was prompting for\n\n503\n00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,300\nthat account.\n\n504\n00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,723\nWith the public folders like that,\n\n505\n00:23:18,723 --> 00:23:22,055\nthere is still a degree of\nauthentication that has to happen.\n\n506\n00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:26,470\nAnd if you've got the home group set up or\nwhatever, that happens automatically.\n\n507\n00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,450\nWhen you've got it like this,\nbecause I have an account,\n\n508\n00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,620\nit just prompted me for it.\n\n509\n00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,820\nSo, and now I've made it angry, so\nit's not gonna let me in anyway.\n\n510\n00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,320\nBut the public folders are there.\n\n511\n00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,250\nI do constantly forget about those,\nbecause if I wanna share something,\n\n512\n00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,045\nI usually make the share myself,\nso I can control the permissions.\n\n513\n00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,490\nThe public folders, you really don't\ncontrol the permissions beyond what\n\n514\n00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,770\nthe Network and\nSharing Center lets you do, right?\n\n515\n00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,701\nThe Network and Sharing Center has\na couple of options in there, but\n\n516\n00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:51,792\nnot a whole heck of a lot.\n\n517\n00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:52,542\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n518\n00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,333\nYeah.\nBut it is a quick and easy way.\n\n519\n00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,083\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n520\n00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:55,708\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n521\n00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,750\n>> All right.\n\n522\n00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,208\nWell Nate, Home Groups are the logical\nnext thing for us to talk about.\n\n523\n00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,910\nBut we don't have enough\ntime in this segment.\n\n524\n00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,770\nDo you have anything else you wanna\ncover before we hit the break?\n\n525\n00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,420\n>> I think that's good for right now.\n\n526\n00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,060\n>> Okay.\n\n527\n00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,150\nLet's stop here and take a break.\n\n528\n00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,905\nWhen we get back we're gonna hit\nthe Homegroups, it'll be exciting and fun.\n\n529\n00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:16,520\nHomegroups, which have been around for\na couple of versions of Windows now, but\n\n530\n00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,410\nare still incredibly useful.\n\n531\n00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,603\nSo we'll tackle those, stay tuned, and\nwe'll be back after these messages.\n\n532\n00:24:22,603 --> 00:24:30,730\n[MUSIC]\n\n533\n00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,670\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n534\n00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,323\nSo we left off talking about sharing and\nwe had mentioned Windows Homegroups.\n\n535\n00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:38,690\nRight?\nAnd how convenient and\n\n536\n00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,970\neasy they are and\nthen we conveniently didn't do them.\n\n537\n00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,260\nSo, we ran out of time.\n\n538\n00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,531\nSo now we got some time.\n\n539\n00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:47,502\nSo, let's take a look\nat Windows Homegroups.\n\n540\n00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:50,682\n>> Yep, Windows homegroups\nis pretty easy to setup.\n\n541\n00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:51,700\nRight?\n\n542\n00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,540\nAnd there can only be one\nhomegroup on a network.\n\n543\n00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,610\n>> So like the Highlander.\n\n544\n00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,680\n>> There can only one.\n\n545\n00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,490\nOnly one homegroup on a network.\n\n546\n00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,660\nAnd yeah, I guess maybe the best\nthing to do is just to,\n\n547\n00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,730\nI guess talk about it as we go through and\nset it up.\n\n548\n00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,830\n>> So, because there can only be one\nhomegroup you basically have to pick\n\n549\n00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,230\na computer to start on.\n\n550\n00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,340\nRight?\nSo do you wanna start it on yours?\n\n551\n00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,785\n>> Sure.\n>> Excellent less work for me.\n\n552\n00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,510\n[LAUGH] So, Nate's gonna fire one up.\n\n553\n00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,940\nAnd it's really pretty easy.\n\n554\n00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,520\nSo, let's pull his computer up.\n\n555\n00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,350\nWindows will actually,\nat several point, give you hints about,\n\n556\n00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,050\nhey do you want to start a home group,\nor whatever?\n\n557\n00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,850\nBut it is pretty easy to set up,\neven from scratch.\n\n558\n00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,110\n>> Yep.\nWhat I do is open up Windows Explorer and\n\n559\n00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,750\nover here on this side, Homegroup.\n\n560\n00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,710\nClick on Homegroup and then right there.\n\n561\n00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,212\nRight there starts\nthe beginning of the Wizard.\n\n562\n00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:50,610\nAnd I'll click Create a Homegroup and\nthen we'll just walk through the folder.\n\n563\n00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,900\nWe've got this little intro.\n\n564\n00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,850\nWe can just click through that.\n\n565\n00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,840\nNow we pick what exactly we want\nto share with the homegroup.\n\n566\n00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,970\nRight?\n\n567\n00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,610\nPictures, videos, music,\ndocuments, printers and devices.\n\n568\n00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,060\nWe can choose if we want to share them or\nnot share them.\n\n569\n00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,700\nThe documents,\nI don't really want to share those.\n\n570\n00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,100\nSo I'll leave it at the default,\nwhich is not share.\n\n571\n00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,480\nWe'll click Next through it, and\nit goes and it sets the permissions and\n\n572\n00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,470\nthe firewall rules and that's it.\n\n573\n00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,320\nAnd then it gives me a password.\n\n574\n00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,630\nNow this password is what I'll give\nto the other people who want to join\n\n575\n00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,690\nthe homegroup.\n\n576\n00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,345\nThey'll enter in this password and\nthen they'll be a part of my homegroup.\n\n577\n00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:34,515\n>> The real nice thing about it is?\n\n578\n00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:36,845\nThere's no user names to mess around with,\nor user accounts,\n\n579\n00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,025\njust one flat level of access.\n\n580\n00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:42,195\nAnd you punch that code in one time,\nand then it's done.\n\n581\n00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:44,495\nYou don't have to punch it in ever again.\n\n582\n00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:46,725\nYou're joined to that homegroup and\nyou're in business.\n\n583\n00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:47,320\nAll right?\n\n584\n00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,240\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm going to gonna\njoin that homegroup from my machine and\n\n585\n00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,810\nthen I'll be able to access\nthe documents that he's shared and\n\n586\n00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,242\nhe'll able to access\nthe ones that I've shared.\n\n587\n00:26:56,242 --> 00:26:58,430\nAll right?\nSo let's flip over to my computer and\n\n588\n00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,760\nI'll get join.\n\n589\n00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,360\nNow, what I like to do is I go\nabout it a slightly different way.\n\n590\n00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,960\nBecause you can go right from the start\nmenu if you just type in homegroup and\n\n591\n00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,740\nthen click on Settings\nover on the right side.\n\n592\n00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,580\nYou'll see where we have a modern\nUI interface for the homegroup too.\n\n593\n00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,250\nThis way is a little less common.\n\n594\n00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,840\nI don't blame Nate for\ndoing it his way because Microsoft\n\n595\n00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,890\ndidn't see fit to create an Explorer\ninterface for the modern UI.\n\n596\n00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,460\nSo you can't like browse your folders and\nstuff from the Start Menu.\n\n597\n00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,630\nIt's kind of frustrating, there's some\ngreat third party ones in the store.\n\n598\n00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,900\nBut, you can configure your homegroup.\n\n599\n00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,100\nAnd so I can go in here and\nnotice how it's already found Nate.\n\n600\n00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,760\nIt says a home group is available.\n\n601\n00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,251\nNathan Copeland on NATE-ITPROTV\nhas created a homegroup,\n\n602\n00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,380\njoin it by punching in the password.\n\n603\n00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,100\nAnd so I say, hey Nate.\n\n604\n00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,020\nWhat's that password?\n\n605\n00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,820\nAnd then he could tell it to me if it\nwasn't such a long and obnoxious one.\n\n606\n00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,540\nHe is frantically typing to\npaste it into my shared folder.\n\n607\n00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,470\nAt least I think that's what you're doing.\n\n608\n00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,812\n>> So Let me see.\n\n609\n00:28:04,812 --> 00:28:11,520\n>> I forgot right away which folder it\nwas that I just barely shared with you.\n\n610\n00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,521\nSo, I did paste into one and\n\n611\n00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:18,140\nI'm not sure if I gave the proper\nsharing permissions on that.\n\n612\n00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,067\nI guess I could share with my homegroup.\n\n613\n00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:21,220\n>> I could find that here.\n\n614\n00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,220\nSo, when I browse to your computer\nI see games and I see users.\n\n615\n00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,920\n>> Oh yeah, and games.\n\n616\n00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,080\nThat's it.\n\n617\n00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,520\n>> Hey, there we go, homegroup.\n\n618\n00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,280\nSo this way, I can just copy and\npaste the password.\n\n619\n00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,460\nThat's a heck of a lot easier.\n\n620\n00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,160\nYou could email it to somebody, just keep\nin mind that if this gets out there,\n\n621\n00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,280\nthis is your encryption and\ndecryption key.\n\n622\n00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,780\nIt's a synchronous encryption,\nor a symmetric encryption key.\n\n623\n00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,890\nThere we go.\n\n624\n00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,430\nAnd so if somebody gets a hold of this,\nthey would have access to your homegroup.\n\n625\n00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,180\nBut because we're talking\nabout a home network anyway,\n\n626\n00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:56,728\nit's not like it is the Los Alamos nuclear\nlaboratories or something like that.\n\n627\n00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:57,269\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n628\n00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,350\nI'm gonna punch in\nthe code that he gave me.\n\n629\n00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,100\nAnd I'm gonna join.\n\n630\n00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,820\nAnd as soon as it's done,\nI'll be connected to Nate's homegroup.\n\n631\n00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,670\nAnd so,\n>> Yeah, and this password,\n\n632\n00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:14,550\nwe don't have the option to pick\nwhat password that we have for this.\n\n633\n00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,380\nWindows automatically generates it.\n\n634\n00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,380\n>> And I guess we'd get what we get.\n\n635\n00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,050\n>> Yeah, and\nit's not too bad of a password.\n\n636\n00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,690\nRight?\nIt's definitely not short.\n\n637\n00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,660\nIt does have capital and\nlowercase letters and numbers.\n\n638\n00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,310\nIt doesn't have special\ncharacters which is nice, but\n\n639\n00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,640\nit does have a lot of a mixture there.\n\n640\n00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,460\nThe only way I know of to change it is to\nleave your homegroup and build a new one.\n\n641\n00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,050\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n642\n00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,220\n>> But then that disconnects everybody.\n\n643\n00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,710\nMine is taking it's time\njoining that homegroup.\n\n644\n00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,250\n>> We had a time connecting our\ncomputers just sharing folders.\n\n645\n00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,190\nSo it's just kind of taking its\ntime today, talking to each other.\n\n646\n00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,240\n>> All right,\nwell while it's churning through that,\n\n647\n00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,480\nyou're not just limited to\ntwo computers on a homegroup.\n\n648\n00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,110\nYou could add more, so\nif you have a bunch of computers.\n\n649\n00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,140\nI know like at home, I have my laptop,\nmy wife's laptop, and our media center.\n\n650\n00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,450\nSo three machines,\ntheyre all in our little homegroup.\n\n651\n00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,800\nAnd it makes it real easy to\nshare those documents and\n\n652\n00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,790\nfiles when we're in the house.\n\n653\n00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,440\nSo, it's definitely easier than\nsetting up a domain controller and\n\n654\n00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,400\njoining everybody to a centralized domain.\n\n655\n00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,470\nWhich most home users\njust aren't going to do.\n\n656\n00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,850\nWell, gee, while were waiting on that\none Nate, cause it is taking it's time.\n\n657\n00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:36,140\nWhen Nate shared out the homegroup,\nit let him pick what he wanted to share.\n\n658\n00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,830\nRight?\n\n659\n00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,130\nAnd what it was listing\nthere were the Libraries.\n\n660\n00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,690\nSo while were waiting on this, why don't\nwe talk about Libraries for a second.\n\n661\n00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,842\nDoes that sound good or?\n\n662\n00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:49,040\n>> Yeah I've got a little bit of\nhomegroup stuff while we wait for\n\n663\n00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,160\nyour homegroup thing\n>> Okay.\n\n664\n00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,240\nLets switch back over\nto your machine then.\n\n665\n00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,923\n>> We could cover it,\n\n666\n00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:54,570\nI mean when yours connects\n>> It's all good,\n\n667\n00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,460\nlet's jump back to yours,\nwe'll see if mine will connect eventually.\n\n668\n00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,100\n>> All right.\n\n669\n00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,280\nSo, yeah, here on my computer,\nit's now under homegroup.\n\n670\n00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,640\nIt's got my name listed there.\n\n671\n00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,860\nI am a part of the home group,\nand when Don's computer connects,\n\n672\n00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,380\nthen he will also appear\nin this list under me.\n\n673\n00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,925\nNow, we can expand out with the little\narrow, and with my account.\n\n674\n00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:20,760\nRight?\n\n675\n00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,405\nIt's whatever computer I have signed\nin will appear under my name.\n\n676\n00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:27,238\nSo, like at my house.\n\n677\n00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:29,520\nAll right, I have my desktop that I use.\n\n678\n00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,440\nThen we've got a kitchen computer for\neverybody,\n\n679\n00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,320\nand I've got the little Dell\nhere that I use for things.\n\n680\n00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,130\nAnd under my name, it's got My Desktop,\nKitchen Computer, and\n\n681\n00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:44,560\nit's got this computer here listed under\nthere for all the different things.\n\n682\n00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,240\nAnd then on this computer for\nthe files I have shared in the homegroup.\n\n683\n00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,960\nRight?\nIt lists out my shares.\n\n684\n00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,010\nSo a convenient way.\n\n685\n00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,548\nWhen Don connects he'll be.\n\n686\n00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:58,439\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He'll be under this list here too with\n\n687\n00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:03,917\nme, and yeah, it's pretty yeah, easy,\nconvenient, everyone's listed under there.\n\n688\n00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:09,167\nAnd let's say that when it does\ncome time to share out something,\n\n689\n00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:15,466\nsomething new right click right on just\nsome folder that we wanna share with and\n\n690\n00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:19,610\nthen I could choose to share\nit with the HomeGroup.\n\n691\n00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:23,310\nAnd let the HomeGroup view it,\nso with read permissions, or\n\n692\n00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:27,530\nview and edit which would be like read and\nwrite permissions.\n\n693\n00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:31,865\nAnd if I click on HomeGroup,\nView and Edit and that's it.\n\n694\n00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:37,075\nAdded to the HomeGroup, whenever done\nsigns on it will appear now in the Shares,\n\n695\n00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:40,345\nit will have edit permissions really easy,\n\n696\n00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:43,410\na couple of clicks and,\nyeah and it goes through.\n\n697\n00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:48,390\nReal convenient, I use HomeGroups at\nmy house, share almost everything.\n\n698\n00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,470\nJust, you know you get home,\n\n699\n00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,040\nyou don't really wanna mess around with\nuser accounts and permissions and things.\n\n700\n00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,490\nYou throw up a HomeGroup and\nthen you can share out printers too.\n\n701\n00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,990\nIt's easy and fantastic.\n\n702\n00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,120\n>> You know the other shortcut that I use,\nwhen you right clicked on that file,\n\n703\n00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,800\nright beneath the share with HomeGroup\noption, there was include in library.\n\n704\n00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,340\nAnd with your HomeGroup, you've\nalready shared out your library and so\n\n705\n00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,015\nyou can use that option right there.\n\n706\n00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:16,410\nlike you float over include in library.\n\n707\n00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:19,750\nYou'll see where you can pick\nfrom documents, music, pictures.\n\n708\n00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,140\nNow you didn't share\ndocuments in your HomeGroup,\n\n709\n00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,250\nyou chose not to do that one but\nyou did do music, pictures, videos.\n\n710\n00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,410\nSo if you were to include that in one of\nthose existing libraries that was already\n\n711\n00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,700\nshared out to the HomeGroup,\nthat would in turn share this folder also.\n\n712\n00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,689\nSo that's another way to do it,\nmaking use of those libraries.\n\n713\n00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,850\nSo, it says Windows can't set\nup a HomeGroup on this computer.\n\n714\n00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,780\nSo it looks like it is\na problem on my end.\n\n715\n00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,120\nLet me go the other way.\n\n716\n00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:53,854\nAll right, so it sees your HomeGroup.\n\n717\n00:33:58,615 --> 00:33:59,376\nWait a minute,\n\n718\n00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:03,074\nit looks like mine was trying to create\na HomeGroup which is not what I want.\n\n719\n00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,178\nYeah, join now.\n\n720\n00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:16,340\nWell, but see how it doesn't say, normally\nit says on here like, your machine and\n\n721\n00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,090\nit says so and so created a HomeGroup.\n\n722\n00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,050\nThis seems to me seems like\nit's about to create one.\n\n723\n00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,240\n>> Well let's click through it and\nsee what happens.\n\n724\n00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,560\n>> Oh no, there it is it shows name,\nall right.\n\n725\n00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,500\nSo, apparently it did find you.\n\n726\n00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,210\nAnd that is the right password, right?\n\n727\n00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,150\nYou couldn't possible have made\na typo right that would be.\n\n728\n00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,782\n>> Oh no, no Ctrl + C and Ctrl + X.\n\n729\n00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:42,700\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n730\n00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,270\nWell, we'll give it another\nchance here and see what happens.\n\n731\n00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,450\nOtherwise I'll have to look\nat my event viewer, and\n\n732\n00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,300\nactually we could probably\ndo that while it's thinking.\n\n733\n00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,780\nIf we have to troubleshoot\njoining a HomeGroup,\n\n734\n00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,200\nsome of the problems that I can think of.\n\n735\n00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:00,510\nI have seen problems where if one computer\nwas on a wireless network and the other\n\n736\n00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,970\none was physically cabled in, I've seen\nissues with the discovery process.\n\n737\n00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,860\nI've had that happen at home, and\n\n738\n00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,380\nit's part of the way that IPv6\ndoes its network discovery.\n\n739\n00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,030\nYou can find a lot of references on\nMicrosoft's web site where other people\n\n740\n00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,650\nhave had that problem too.\n\n741\n00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:20,100\nOther issues might be that maybe\nI've already joined a HomeGroup.\n\n742\n00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,635\nYou can only be a member of one HomeGroup,\nso that might be part of the issue.\n\n743\n00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:28,777\nOr it could be that IPv6 is being\nblocked by my firewall and IPv4 isn't.\n\n744\n00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:33,235\nThe HomeGroup relies on IPv6 so\nthat can stop things too.\n\n745\n00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:35,308\nWhile that's running I'm gonna\ngo into my Event Viewer.\n\n746\n00:35:38,884 --> 00:35:42,006\nAnd just see if I have anything\nhere in my Windows system log\n\n747\n00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:49,009\nThat might indicate an issue\nwith the HomeGroup.\n\n748\n00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,996\nAnd it looks like I've got\na bunch of kernel events, but\n\n749\n00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:59,389\nnothing too glaring in there.\n\n750\n00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:06,031\nAnd let me just check my application log.\n\n751\n00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,250\nI do have an app problem.\n\n752\n00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,198\nLet me see what I have here.\n\n753\n00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:11,827\nOh, that was because of my little monitor.\n\n754\n00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:13,700\nThose are from earlier.\n\n755\n00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,560\nSo, not really seeing anything\njumping out at me here as\n\n756\n00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:23,890\na big issue or anything.\n\n757\n00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,959\nSo let me just go into\nthe actual HomeGroup logs.\n\n758\n00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:36,630\nAnd HomeGroup status changed.\n\n759\n00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,390\nOh, did it join?\n\n760\n00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,750\nNo?\n\n761\n00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,330\nIt does show my HomeGroup status having\nchanged in here, but it doesn't say.\n\n762\n00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:50,007\nWhen I have it up in here.\n\n763\n00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,586\nOh, HomeGroup page, catastrophic failure.\n\n764\n00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:53,475\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's a good\n\n765\n00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:55,210\n>> [LAUGH] Good error to get right there.\n\n766\n00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:00,270\nDoesn't really tell me why just says\nnew HomeGroup is available to join.\n\n767\n00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,734\nThat's funny.\n\n768\n00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:06,775\nAll right, so not getting anything\nreally great in there and\n\n769\n00:37:06,775 --> 00:37:09,290\nso we'll just have to wait and\nsee if it connects.\n\n770\n00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,187\nAlright, well,\nwe don't have to wait on me.\n\n771\n00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,647\n>> Right.\n\n772\n00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,380\nThat's too bad.\n\n773\n00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,430\n>> I know.\n\n774\n00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,960\nNo computer left behind.\n\n775\n00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,230\n>> I was really hope that you could\nhave joined my HomeGroup, Don.\n\n776\n00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,610\n>> [LAUGH]\nSo you can install a Rootkit?\n\n777\n00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:31,810\n[LAUGH] There is a certain degree of\ntrust when you do a HomeGroup, right?\n\n778\n00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,830\nThese documents,\nthese folders they're shared and\n\n779\n00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,970\nyou can, you gave read write\npermission to most of your folders,\n\n780\n00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,960\nso that is giving somebody a lot\nof control over your documents.\n\n781\n00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,620\n>> I'm a real trusting guy,\nI mean if yeah, I don't know.\n\n782\n00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,070\nIf I give you the password to my HomeGroup\nthen you know I mean that's yeah I mean\n\n783\n00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,990\nyour in my home.\n\n784\n00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,330\n>> That is a good way to look at it, yeah.\n\n785\n00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,100\nIf your physically in the house because\n\n786\n00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,425\nI could just as easily\npunch you in the face.\n\n787\n00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:00,060\n[LAUGH] And I wouldn't even\nneed a password for that so.\n\n788\n00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,930\n>> Man.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n789\n00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,510\n>> Man.\n\n790\n00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,038\nYeah well, I'm not gonna\nshare my game files with you.\n\n791\n00:38:05,038 --> 00:38:08,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or my FRAP screen shares.\n\n792\n00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,230\n>> There we go.\n\n793\n00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,105\nAll right, well.\n\n794\n00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:11,505\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n795\n00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:13,375\nAlthough we're not seeing\nit here on my machine,\n\n796\n00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,935\nthe point of a HomeGroup is that\nit's supposed to be super easy and\n\n797\n00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:19,985\nconvenient, mine is angry and\ndoesn't want to tell me why.\n\n798\n00:38:19,985 --> 00:38:23,850\nBut typically you punch in that password,\nit joins right up, and you're in business.\n\n799\n00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,710\nI probably just need to reboot or\nsomething.\n\n800\n00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,660\nThat'll usually clear\na lot of this stuff up.\n\n801\n00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,270\nI also have an extra network\ncard on my system, and so\n\n802\n00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,380\nthat could be throwing it too.\n\n803\n00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,450\nThere's a couple of different things\nthat can kinda throw a wrench in it.\n\n804\n00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,960\n>> Well, yeah,\nI guess now we can move on to libraries.\n\n805\n00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,190\nIf you want libraries, right?\n\n806\n00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,060\nThis real cool thing kind of like where\nyou can put all of your files into\n\n807\n00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,850\na pointer, more or less.\n\n808\n00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:54,370\nA central place to go for files and things\nthat can be scattered throughout your hard\n\n809\n00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,840\ndrive and it will look and\nappear like it is in one location.\n\n810\n00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,030\nPretty nice and convenient.\n\n811\n00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,500\n>> Yeah, it really is just a pointer.\n\n812\n00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,840\nThere's no Physical location for\nthe library on the hard drive.\n\n813\n00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,188\nThe folders inside the library\nare pointers that are coming from\n\n814\n00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:10,570\nsomewhere else.\n\n815\n00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,810\nAnd so you can use this for\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n816\n00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:16,430\nThe feature I like best about the library\nis when you create a library,\n\n817\n00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,910\nyou tell it what type of file is in there.\n\n818\n00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,460\nYou tell it they're going to be pictures,\nmusic files or documents or whatever and\n\n819\n00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,370\nit will adjust the display settings for\nthat library.\n\n820\n00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,880\nSo, if you say that it's pictures when you\nbrowse to it, it will automatically show\n\n821\n00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,000\nthumbnails of the pictures, but if you\nsay that it's music it'll automatically\n\n822\n00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,320\nswitch to the view that shows the song\nname, the duration, the track number.\n\n823\n00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,250\nThe relevant metadata for\nthat particular file type.\n\n824\n00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,808\nThat's probably, in my opinion,\nthe best feature of a library.\n\n825\n00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:52,016\n>> We can add just about any\nfolder on our hard drive and\n\n826\n00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:56,377\nadd it to a library, create a library, and\n\n827\n00:39:56,377 --> 00:40:01,000\nstick it in there, and\nhave it all included.\n\n828\n00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,910\nAnd you can also add shares\ninto your library and\n\n829\n00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,250\nit makes it even more communicative.\n\n830\n00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,656\nIf Don shared out a pictures\nfolder of all his screen grabs of\n\n831\n00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:14,711\na My Little Pony game that he\nwas just telling me about,\n\n832\n00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:18,890\nthen I could add that into\nmy My Pictures library.\n\n833\n00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,050\nAnd on Windows 8 I'd browse to\nmy little pictures thing and\n\n834\n00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:26,300\nit browses through all the pictures\nin my My Pictures library.\n\n835\n00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,820\nAnd then I'd have all\nDon's Pony grabs in there.\n\n836\n00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,250\nIt's-\n>> Pony grabs.\n\n837\n00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,175\nIt just sounds dirty.\n\n838\n00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:35,950\n>> [LAUGH]\nIt's My Little Pony Gameboy Edition.\n\n839\n00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:41,470\nIf you want to get specific, and\nshowing up in My Pictures file.\n\n840\n00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:46,396\nIt's really cool, really convenient,\nand awesome thing with libraries.\n\n841\n00:40:46,396 --> 00:40:47,522\n>> Yeah.\n\n842\n00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:48,189\nWell there we go.\n\n843\n00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:51,170\nAnd so there are libraries\nthat are built into Windows.\n\n844\n00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,060\nYou've already seen them here.\n\n845\n00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,520\nWe had documents, music, pictures, videos.\n\n846\n00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,140\nYou can create your own\nlibraries really easy.\n\n847\n00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,670\nLet me just do a quick example of that.\n\n848\n00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,940\nSo I just went into the Windows Explorer\nhere on My Computer and\n\n849\n00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,190\nthat's kind of where we\ncan see those libraries.\n\n850\n00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,650\nSo I see if I click on Libraries on\nthe left side I've got documents,\n\n851\n00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,940\nmusic, pictures, videos.\n\n852\n00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,860\nThose are the ones that\nare there by default.\n\n853\n00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,100\nBut you can right click and\nchoose New > Library, right.\n\n854\n00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:26,160\nAnd so I can create a new library here,\nand I can call it my My Little Pony grabs.\n\n855\n00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,410\n>> There we go yep.\n\n856\n00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,170\nI think that should be hyphenated.\n\n857\n00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,880\nIt's our new word, pony grabs.\n\n858\n00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,025\nSo here's my pony grabs.\n\n859\n00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:33,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n860\n00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,336\nI need to tell it what kind of library\nthat is and so I can right click on it.\n\n861\n00:41:37,336 --> 00:41:41,290\nI can try.\n\n862\n00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,060\nThere we go.\n\n863\n00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,520\nI can right click on it and\nchoose properties.\n\n864\n00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,100\nAnd in the properties for pony grabs,\nI can go in and I can change\n\n865\n00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,260\nthe library icon to to make it represent\npony butts or whatever is easier.\n\n866\n00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,130\nAnd then under optimize this library.\n\n867\n00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,280\nFour is where I can tell\nit what's in there, right?\n\n868\n00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,450\nThis one's going to be pictures.\n\n869\n00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,480\nI'm going to have pictures\nof My Little Ponies in here.\n\n870\n00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,340\nAnd then I can start to add\nfolders to the library.\n\n871\n00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,780\nSo I can choose add.\n\n872\n00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,850\nRemember the library itself\ndoesn't exist on the hard drive.\n\n873\n00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:13,070\nWhen I choose add,\nI'm picking folders to put in there.\n\n874\n00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:19,769\nSo maybe I wanna put in my little\nfraps application that I use.\n\n875\n00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:24,030\nSo if I go into C > Fraps > Screenshots.\n\n876\n00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:28,180\nSo I might wanna include that folder,\nso now C:/fraps/screenshots is gonna be\n\n877\n00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,945\nincluded in my pony grabs library.\n\n878\n00:42:33,945 --> 00:42:35,435\nI'll change the icon.\n\n879\n00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:38,535\nI wonder, do we have a pony icon?\n\n880\n00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:40,530\nWould that be too much to ask, probably.\n\n881\n00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,031\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n882\n00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:46,600\nwell we'll have to find something\nelse suitable for our little library.\n\n883\n00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,006\nYeah, there is nothing jumping out for\nponies is there?\n\n884\n00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:54,091\n>> For ponies, yeah.\n\n885\n00:42:54,091 --> 00:42:56,700\nIt's like they don't make Windows for\nlittle girls apparently.\n\n886\n00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,710\nAnd, all right.\n\n887\n00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,050\nSo I'll just pick this icon.\n\n888\n00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,510\nSo I'll change that icon.\n\n889\n00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,040\n>> You remember the plus add on pack?\n\n890\n00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,200\n>> Yeah, Microsoft plus pack, yeah.\n\n891\n00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,120\n>> Yeah, I bet if you had plus add-on for-\n>> Then you would have the leaves and\n\n892\n00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,150\nthe Da Vinci machines and all that stuff.\n\n893\n00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,120\nYeah, that was the good\nold days of windows.\n\n894\n00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,700\n>> Yep, good old days.\n\n895\n00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,150\n>> So if I browse into this library.\n\n896\n00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,190\nSee how I see that C:/fraps folder\nin there and if I browse into it,\n\n897\n00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,640\nit's actually the screenshots\nfolder that's being displayed.\n\n898\n00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,530\nAnd any pictures that I put\nin there would show up.\n\n899\n00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:35,540\nSo I could, here,\nlet's put something in there.\n\n900\n00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,720\nSo I'm gonna go into Microsoft Paint, and\n\n901\n00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,610\nI'm gonna make full use\nof my touchscreen here.\n\n902\n00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,613\nAnd I'm gonna draw\n\n903\n00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:55,183\nThere it is.\n\n904\n00:43:55,183 --> 00:43:56,990\nThis is my pony.\n\n905\n00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,520\nOh, my niece would love this.\n\n906\n00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,910\nAlthough it doesn't look like a pony.\n\n907\n00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,790\nIt looks like a sickly dragon,\nbut there we go.\n\n908\n00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,510\nSo, there's my pony and\nI'm gonna save that.\n\n909\n00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:12,510\nAnd I'll save it into\nC:\\fraps\\ screen shots.\n\n910\n00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:16,890\nI am going to save it in there so\nI know it is in that folder.\n\n911\n00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:22,160\nAnd if I get out of that,\nlet me just get out of all this stuff and\n\n912\n00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,870\nyour stupid home group [LAUGH].\n\n913\n00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,720\nLet me just go into Explorer.\n\n914\n00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,680\nLet me get an all new Explorer window\nopen so I know this is fresh and clean.\n\n915\n00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,300\nI am going to go into libraries and\nI am going to go into pony grabs.\n\n916\n00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,050\nAnd screenshots, it's got a one beside it.\n\n917\n00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:42,230\nIf I expand that out, there's my pony\ngrab right there inside of the library.\n\n918\n00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,190\nI'm sure if Bill Gates is watching\nthe show he's probably getting\n\n919\n00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,500\nthe attorneys ready because we're poorly\nrepresenting Windows but libraries,\n\n920\n00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,440\nthey were kind of neat.\n\n921\n00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,320\n>> It is neat.\n\n922\n00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,970\nIt is neat.\n\n923\n00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,949\nI do like your, yeah.\n\n924\n00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:58,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was almost like a little loss for\n\n925\n00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,071\nwords there.\n\n926\n00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,166\n>> Yeah you weren't expecting me to\nrun with the whole pun intended thing.\n\n927\n00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,694\n>> Well no, I really didn't but,\nI am glad you did.\n\n928\n00:45:05,694 --> 00:45:08,950\n>> Never underestimate\nthe artistic abilities of Don\n\n929\n00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,100\n>> Definitely stay tuned for\n\n930\n00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,268\nmore amazing artwork from the Don Pezet\nslash Bob Ross school of IT design.\n\n931\n00:45:16,268 --> 00:45:20,650\n[LAUGH] Bob Ross is dead, he can't.\n\n932\n00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,070\nThe state of Bob Ross will.\n\n933\n00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,530\nSo anyhow,\nthat's probably all we really have on.\n\n934\n00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,370\nYou have anything else?\n\n935\n00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,690\n>> Yeah, maybe.\n\n936\n00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,520\nProbably.\n\n937\n00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,440\nWe could.\n\n938\n00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,570\n>> Okay?\nLay it on me.\n\n939\n00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,140\nWhat do you got?\n\n940\n00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:41,640\n>> I'd like to add your fraps folder share\nto my library so it appears in my library.\n\n941\n00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,980\nAnd I browsed your computer and I'm not\neven showing any of your stuff anywhere.\n\n942\n00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,650\n>> I un-shared it.\n\n943\n00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,210\nWhen I started messing with\nthe home group, I removed it,\n\n944\n00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:52,220\ncuz I was like, we're gonna have\na home group, it'll be in the library.\n\n945\n00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,890\nBut then the home group didn't function.\n\n946\n00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,620\nSo let me, here,\nI'll share out the fraps folder again.\n\n947\n00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,210\nAnd I will share that with Nate.\n\n948\n00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:03,910\nAll right it is now shared.\n\n949\n00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,480\n>> Sweet.\n\n950\n00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,290\nAll right.\n\n951\n00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:12,540\nYeah, we can jump over to my computer,\nis that right Don?\n\n952\n00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,270\n>> Yeah, yep.\nJump on over to Nate's.\n\n953\n00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,390\nAll right.\n\n954\n00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,950\nSo he's browsed over the network\nto get to my fraps folder.\n\n955\n00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,790\n>> And there is the screen shots, and\n\n956\n00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,843\nsure enough there is the Don's screen shot\n>> I spelled it wrong.\n\n957\n00:46:25,843 --> 00:46:27,806\nPony.\n\n958\n00:46:27,806 --> 00:46:29,960\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oops.\n\n959\n00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,988\n>> God forbid.\n\n960\n00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,640\n>> All right, so pretty easy and simple.\n\n961\n00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,920\nSo I take a screen shots here.\n\n962\n00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,360\nYou just kind of click and\ndrag and there's my libraries.\n\n963\n00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,210\nYou just go and\ncopy it right into something.\n\n964\n00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,020\nSo I dropped it right in to My Pictures.\n\n965\n00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,670\nIf I go into My Pictures,\n\n966\n00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,330\nthere is Don's [LAUGH]\n>> I fixed the spelling so\n\n967\n00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,300\nnow it shows up twice.\n\n968\n00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,200\n>> That's nice.\n\n969\n00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,430\nI like that though.\n\n970\n00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,778\nTwice the,\n>> Twice the rainbow magic.\n\n971\n00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:08,719\n>> Yep.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n972\n00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:10,240\n>> So now you know, libraries,\n\n973\n00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,900\npretty neat.\n\n974\n00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,900\nDoesn't have to include things\nthat are local on this computer.\n\n975\n00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,820\nSo I can add Don's share\ninto my libraries.\n\n976\n00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:24,380\nYou can go to libraries, pictures, then\nsure enough, and there are Don's pictures.\n\n977\n00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:31,200\nSo now whenever he grabs more screen\ngrabs of various games of all types,\n\n978\n00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,030\nwe don't discriminate, we play all kinds,\nand adds them to his screenshots and\n\n979\n00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:41,850\nfraps it will now appear in my\nMy Pictures screengrabs library.\n\n980\n00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,080\nPretty fantastic, real easy.\n\n981\n00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:51,300\nI mean easy way to share things and\nkind of have it auto populate up there.\n\n982\n00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,650\nPretty nice and hand for\nscreengrabs and all sorts of things.\n\n983\n00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,820\n>> Sweet and pony grabs.\n\n984\n00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,290\nMy gosh.\n\n985\n00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,417\n>> All right, well we're running low on\ntime for this segment so let's stop here.\n\n986\n00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:07,052\nWe still have plenty more Windows 8\naction packed adventures available for\n\n987\n00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:08,910\nthe rest of the episode.\n\n988\n00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:13,208\nWe still have printers and SkyDrive,\nall sorts of fun stuff to talk about.\n\n989\n00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,917\nSo let's stop here and take a break.\n\n990\n00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:18,730\nWhen we get back,\nmore printing and clouds.\n\n991\n00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,143\nCuz you have clouds with your ponies.\n\n992\n00:48:20,143 --> 00:48:20,830\n>> Yep, that's right.\n\n993\n00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,560\nSo, some more clouds to be had.\n\n994\n00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,674\nWe'll see you again.\n\n995\n00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:33,620\n[SOUND]\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n996\n00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,760\nSo we have a minor amendment to\nmake to a comment that I said.\n\n997\n00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,920\nI said, and\nNate proved me wrong during the break.\n\n998\n00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,330\nI said, the only way I know\nof to change a homegroup\n\n999\n00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,770\npassword is to destroy the home group and\nrebuild it.\n\n1000\n00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:50,460\nAnd I said that because I\nhad tried under Windows 7.\n\n1001\n00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,875\nI had not tried in Windows 8 and\nNate wanted you to show me.\n\n1002\n00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,410\n>> That it is indeed possible\n>> So\n\n1003\n00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,825\nI'll hang my head in shame, Nate got me.\n\n1004\n00:48:59,825 --> 00:49:02,550\n>> Yeah it's okay\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1005\n00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,900\n>> I would relish in this rare moment\n\n1006\n00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,230\nto where I can do this,\nbut I'll play it cool and\n\n1007\n00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:13,350\nsay, you know Don,\nWindows is a, I don't know.\n\n1008\n00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,994\nSo in the homegroup setting,\nwe can show it.\n\n1009\n00:49:16,994 --> 00:49:21,610\nMaybe the easiest thing than\ntrying to explain it, right?\n\n1010\n00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,880\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1011\n00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,630\nYeah.\n>> Now, what I did on it is,\n\n1012\n00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,590\nduring the break, I tried.\n\n1013\n00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,800\nI was messing around\nwith homegroups again.\n\n1014\n00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,420\nAnd I unjoined, and\nI created a new homegroup on your computer\n\n1015\n00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,340\nthat you are a part of so I'd have to use\nyour machine and to change your password.\n\n1016\n00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:37,990\n>> Oh, okay,\n\n1017\n00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,430\nall right, I will demonstrate this new\nfeature that I just learned about.\n\n1018\n00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And let me tell you.\n\n1019\n00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,960\nSo basically, it turns out in Windows 8\nyou can change your homegroup password.\n\n1020\n00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,640\nAnd even cooler, you can change\nit to whatever the heck you want.\n\n1021\n00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,420\nAnd so instead of having some jumbly,\n\n1022\n00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:57,530\ncrazy, homegroup string that it\ngenerates automatically for you.\n\n1023\n00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:02,080\nYou can make your own wicked,\nawesome homegroup settings.\n\n1024\n00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,020\nSo, what I'm gonna do is\nI am gonna to fix that.\n\n1025\n00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,660\nSo, I'm going to go into this and\nlet's go ahead and pull up my computer and\n\n1026\n00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:11,450\nI'll show everybody what Nate\njust taught me a minute ago.\n\n1027\n00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,690\nSo, I'm going to talk\nabout it like an expert.\n\n1028\n00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:15,410\n[LAUGH] I've known this for\na whopping seven minutes now.\n\n1029\n00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,160\nSo I'm going to go into my network and\nsharing center.\n\n1030\n00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,330\nAnd on the left side over\nhere I've got homegroup.\n\n1031\n00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:27,760\nAnd in my homegroup right here, we've got\nview or print the homegroup password.\n\n1032\n00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,480\nSo I'm going to go into that screen\nwhere we've got the homegroup password.\n\n1033\n00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:35,460\nYou know what, Nate, looking at it,\nI don't have the daggum option.\n\n1034\n00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,420\nWhere did you go for that?\n\n1035\n00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,260\n>> Oh, just below it, Don.\n\n1036\n00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:42,300\nIf you go back and just below that,\nit says, Change the Password.\n\n1037\n00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:42,825\nSee.\n>> Oh.\n\n1038\n00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:43,610\n[LAUGH]\n\n1039\n00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,960\n>> With the little shield.\n\n1040\n00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,920\n>> All right, all right.\n\n1041\n00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,320\nSo I completely went the wrong way.\n\n1042\n00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,840\nSo Change the Passwords.\n\n1043\n00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,090\nWe'll click on that.\n\n1044\n00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,330\nAnd then, sure enough,\nit gives me the ability to change it.\n\n1045\n00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,430\nNotice what it says.\n\n1046\n00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:58,690\nMake sure all homegroup\ncomputers are on and not asleep.\n\n1047\n00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:02,110\nIf the other computers are on,\nit will in theory, update them, and\n\n1048\n00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,320\nwe'll see right now.\n\n1049\n00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,380\nSo, I'm gonna change change the password,\nand I'll just make it itprotv.\n\n1050\n00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,920\nRight?\nWhy not make it something simple?\n\n1051\n00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,030\nAnd I will hit next.\n\n1052\n00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,590\nAt least eight characters.\n\n1053\n00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,750\nSo I will call it the window,\nor itprotv- areyoukiddingme.\n\n1054\n00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,250\nIt's got a maximum characters also?\n\n1055\n00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,740\nAll right, itprotvhomegroup.\n\n1056\n00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,220\nHow about that?\n>> Mm-hm, I like it.\n\n1057\n00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,400\n>> There we go.\n\n1058\n00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,300\nAll right, so now it's a nice, easy\nphrase that I can share with somebody.\n\n1059\n00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,430\nIt's the itprotvhomegroup.\n\n1060\n00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:34,400\nAnd I can tell other people that.\n\n1061\n00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,120\nNow, in theory, Nate, because your\nmachine was on when I did that.\n\n1062\n00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,200\nYou should have adopted that new password.\n\n1063\n00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,740\n>> Yeah, if I was connected.\n\n1064\n00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,752\n>> Oh, you're not on my homegroup?\n\n1065\n00:51:44,752 --> 00:51:46,400\nMy homegroup is awesome,\ndo you want to join?\n\n1066\n00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,382\n>> I'm gonna try to join it.\n\n1067\n00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:49,010\n>> All right let's jump\nover to Nate's machine and\n\n1068\n00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,650\nsee if he can join my\nsuper awesome home group.\n\n1069\n00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,230\n>> Yup.\nYeah, I know we tried earlier.\n\n1070\n00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,270\nMaybe just changing that\npassword was all that we needed.\n\n1071\n00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,520\nYeah, we can try that out.\n\n1072\n00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,965\nAnd it was itprotvhomegroup.\n\n1073\n00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:09,221\n>> Jason, let's switch over to,\noh, your IVG had died.\n\n1074\n00:52:09,221 --> 00:52:10,134\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1075\n00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:12,615\n[LAUGH] I apologize.\n\n1076\n00:52:12,615 --> 00:52:14,085\n>> We killed your laptop.\n\n1077\n00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:15,085\nOh, no.\n\n1078\n00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:18,855\nSo basically what he's doing, and\nwe'll see it here in just a second,\n\n1079\n00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:24,045\nhe went into the homegroup panel and he is\nin the process of filling out his password\n\n1080\n00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:28,460\nwhich is now the nice,\neasy to use itprotvhomegroup.\n\n1081\n00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,816\nSo that makes life simple and [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1082\n00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,633\nWhat's up?\n\n1083\n00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,370\n>> Jason, you got it coming over?\n\n1084\n00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,470\n>> Did we not pay the IVGA bill?\n\n1085\n00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,250\n>> All right, give me just a second,\nI'll get that.\n\n1086\n00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:49,290\n>> While he's talking about that,\nI do want to mention one other thing.\n\n1087\n00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,490\nSo Nate got me on changing that password.\n\n1088\n00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:53,410\nSo I said, all right I am going\nto get Nate on something.\n\n1089\n00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:58,440\nSo I noticed when he dragged\nthe pony grabs folder\n\n1090\n00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,430\non the library he showed how to\nlink it on the network share.\n\n1091\n00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:05,470\nHe did the right thing, but there's a\nsubtle difference that he didn't mention.\n\n1092\n00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:11,270\nWhen you drag that file and drop it,\nif you drag it with the left mouse button,\n\n1093\n00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,650\nso if you use your left\nmouse button to do the drag,\n\n1094\n00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:16,230\nit'll actually copy that folder over.\n\n1095\n00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,750\nBut if you drag it with the right\nmouse button, it will link it.\n\n1096\n00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:20,440\nRight.\nAnd so\n\n1097\n00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,500\nwhat he was describing during\nthe break was linking that folder,\n\n1098\n00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,540\nbut as a viewer remotely, you couldn't see\nwhether he's using a left mouse button or\n\n1099\n00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,220\na right mouse button.\n\n1100\n00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,200\nSo just make sure if you wanna link it,\nso that you're always\n\n1101\n00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,460\naccessing that network share, that you use\nyour right mouse button when you do it.\n\n1102\n00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,930\nOtherwise if you just want to make a one\ntime copy, you use your left mouse button.\n\n1103\n00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,270\nSo I just wanted to mention that.\n\n1104\n00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,720\nAre you good to go or no?\n\n1105\n00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,063\n>> Yep\n>> Yes, no, maybe so.\n\n1106\n00:53:46,063 --> 00:53:46,843\n>> Huh\n>> Okay.\n\n1107\n00:53:46,843 --> 00:53:48,430\n>> Yep.\n>> Let's go ahead and switch over and\n\n1108\n00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:49,927\nhe's gonna try and\njoin that homegroup now.\n\n1109\n00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:55,660\n>> All right, so as we go,\nI ran through the wizard right quick,\n\n1110\n00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:00,170\nI typed in the easy to remember\npassword and we'll click next and yeah.\n\n1111\n00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:00,900\nWe'll see.\n\n1112\n00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,730\nYou can join mine.\n\n1113\n00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,592\nMaybe I can join yours.\n\n1114\n00:54:03,592 --> 00:54:05,591\n>> Good move.\nMine's more awesome.\n\n1115\n00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:06,342\nMore awesomer.\n\n1116\n00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:08,230\n>> More awsomer.\n\n1117\n00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:13,850\nNow Don, like I said,\nI threw out there, I was just joshing.\n\n1118\n00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,480\nIt wasn't the right mouse button.\n\n1119\n00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,810\nSo you get the upper hand this time.\n\n1120\n00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:21,190\nSo what it was,\nis while we're on this machine.\n\n1121\n00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,260\n>> Oh, he's gonna.\n>> Yep.\n\n1122\n00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,000\n>> You're gonna show me up.\n\n1123\n00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,111\n>> So in here, right,\nso we go over to Don's\n\n1124\n00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:33,250\nlaptop, as it slowly pulls up.\n\n1125\n00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:39,235\nI was dragging a folder\nfrom within your share.\n\n1126\n00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:41,815\nIf I had dragged the share\nitself over then I would\n\n1127\n00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:43,685\n>> it would have automatically linked\n\n1128\n00:54:43,685 --> 00:54:46,195\n>> It would have automatically linked\n\n1129\n00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:48,715\n>> Well when grabbing the folder like you\n\n1130\n00:54:48,715 --> 00:54:52,282\ndid before, you do have to use\nthe right mouse All right.\n\n1131\n00:54:52,282 --> 00:54:52,820\nMan.\n>> [LAUGH] So there.\n\n1132\n00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,770\nYou're going to one up that.\n\n1133\n00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,490\nSo just keep in mind,\nthere are some subtle variations there.\n\n1134\n00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,170\nAnd it is a very subtle variation.\n\n1135\n00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:03,210\nIf it's the share itself, it actually\nwon't let you copy the share, so\n\n1136\n00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,890\nit makes you do the link inside the share.\n\n1137\n00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:08,730\nA right mouse button\ndrag will create a link.\n\n1138\n00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,142\nA left mouse button drag will copy.\n\n1139\n00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:13,730\nAll right, it just does not\nwant to join that home group.\n\n1140\n00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,370\nBut the important part here is that\nwe were able to change that password,\n\n1141\n00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,960\ndoes make it a little more simple.\n\n1142\n00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,090\nIt does weaken the security a bit though\nif it's something that somebody could\n\n1143\n00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,610\nguess but it makes it easier to remember.\n\n1144\n00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,190\nI know a lot of people who will actually\nuse things like a phone number or whatever\n\n1145\n00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:34,100\nbecause again, that's easy to remember,\nbut it is kind of a nice feature.\n\n1146\n00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,880\nAll right, well let's move on to\nsome of the other topics we've got.\n\n1147\n00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,690\nWe've been talking about sharing files and\nfolders, right?\n\n1148\n00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,440\nWe can also share printers,\nand that's really handy.\n\n1149\n00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,060\nEspecially at home.\n\n1150\n00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,370\nIf you only have one printer,\n\n1151\n00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,890\nyou might want multiple\ncomputers be able to share it.\n\n1152\n00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,610\nOr in your business,\nyou might want to cut down on expenses.\n\n1153\n00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,233\nInstead of having one printer for\nevery computer,\n\n1154\n00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:58,167\nyou hook a printer up to one computer and\nyou share it out.\n\n1155\n00:55:58,167 --> 00:56:01,793\n>> I guess it would also cut down on\nlike infrastructure required to like\n\n1156\n00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:04,855\na small business you know you\ndon't have print servers and\n\n1157\n00:56:04,855 --> 00:56:07,604\nall these crazy things you\nput it up to one machine and\n\n1158\n00:56:07,604 --> 00:56:08,750\nshare it through that\n\n1159\n00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:09,667\n>> Yeah\n>> Right?\n\n1160\n00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:12,876\nYeah, the only negative is if\nyou turn that one computer off.\n\n1161\n00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:14,368\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you turn the computer off,\n\n1162\n00:56:14,368 --> 00:56:15,980\nthe printer's no longer shared.\n\n1163\n00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,860\nSo, that whatever computer it is that's\nsharing out the printer has to stay\n\n1164\n00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,690\non all the time.\n\n1165\n00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,350\nBut, a lot of us leave our computers\non all the time anyway, so\n\n1166\n00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,090\nit's not that big of a deal.\n\n1167\n00:56:24,222 --> 00:56:24,974\nSure.\n\n1168\n00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:25,780\n>> All right.\n\n1169\n00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:27,495\nSo you wanna demonstrate printers,\nor do you want me to?\n\n1170\n00:56:27,495 --> 00:56:29,384\nYours is home grouping.\n\n1171\n00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:32,400\n>> Yeah, it's sitting there grinding away.\n\n1172\n00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,500\n>> Well, we'll do it on mine here.\n\n1173\n00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,370\nSo, the first thing I need to do,\nis I need to add a printer.\n\n1174\n00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:40,280\nSo, I'm gonna fire up my machine here.\n\n1175\n00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,380\nAnd I'm just gonna go into the Devices and\nPrinters screen.\n\n1176\n00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,500\nSo, I'm just using the Start menu\nto find Devices and Printers and\n\n1177\n00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,920\nI can see what printers\nI have on my system.\n\n1178\n00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,320\nAnd so I've got several printers.\n\n1179\n00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,470\nActually, I guess I can\nuse this guy right here.\n\n1180\n00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:59,680\nWe have a big office printer here,\none of those big Canon image Runners And\n\n1181\n00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,570\nso I've got it added to my system.\n\n1182\n00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:02,990\nIt's right here.\n\n1183\n00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,440\nWell you know,\nthat's a network printer though.\n\n1184\n00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,920\nLet me do this with a local printer.\n\n1185\n00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,648\nI'll just create a fake one.\n\n1186\n00:57:08,648 --> 00:57:12,830\nSo I'm gonna add a fake\nprinter to my system, and\n\n1187\n00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,480\nI'm just gonna go in and pick it myself.\n\n1188\n00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,050\nSo I'll say add a Local Printer.\n\n1189\n00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,750\nI'll say that it's connected to an LPT.\n\n1190\n00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,410\nOr you know,\nit could be connected to a USB port,\n\n1191\n00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:23,890\nor whatever other crazy\ntechnology you have.\n\n1192\n00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:26,540\nAnd I'll just lie.\n\n1193\n00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,730\nI'll do like a HP.\n\n1194\n00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,540\n>> Don.\n\n1195\n00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,780\n>> I know, I'm a liar.\n\n1196\n00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,330\n>> Oh, my god.\n\n1197\n00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,674\n>> An HP color laser jet 2500.\n\n1198\n00:57:32,674 --> 00:57:33,918\nThat'll be good enough for me.\n\n1199\n00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:35,525\nI'm sure that is a sweet printer.\n\n1200\n00:57:35,525 --> 00:57:39,770\nThe name of the driver, the name of\nthe printer by default is pretty long.\n\n1201\n00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:44,970\nI'm just gonna shorten it up a little\nbit here, HP color laser jet 2500.\n\n1202\n00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:49,500\nAnd when you add a new printer,\n\n1203\n00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,620\nit offers to share it out right\nthere from the very beginning, okay?\n\n1204\n00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,820\nI'm gonna say no to that though,\ncuz it's too easy to do it this way.\n\n1205\n00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,020\nI wanna show you guys\nthe full sharing method.\n\n1206\n00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,900\nSo, I'll just say don't share it.\n\n1207\n00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,540\nAnd we'll create it.\n\n1208\n00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,335\nNow I don't want it to be my default\nbecause it's a fake printer.\n\n1209\n00:58:05,335 --> 00:58:06,460\nBut now I've got it added.\n\n1210\n00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,251\n>> You're not gonna send a test page?\n\n1211\n00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,130\n>> No, not this time, maybe later.\n\n1212\n00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:11,865\n>> Okay.\n\n1213\n00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:15,250\n[LAUGH] So anyhow, I've got this printer\nnow, it's attached to my computer,\n\n1214\n00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,210\nI can print to it, it's awesome.\n\n1215\n00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,980\nNow I wanna let other people,\nmaybe other people in my homegroup or\n\n1216\n00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:22,660\nmaybe just other people on my\nnetwork to be able to print to it.\n\n1217\n00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,910\nSo it's easy enough,\nall I need to do is to right click on it.\n\n1218\n00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:29,580\nAnd when you right click on it, you'll\nsee some of the basic options available.\n\n1219\n00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:33,450\nLike setting the default printer and\nI'm gonna go into Printer Properties.\n\n1220\n00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:38,230\nNow this is something that's confusing\nbecause we have Properties and\n\n1221\n00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:39,210\nPrinter Properties.\n\n1222\n00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,520\nAnd they are different.\n\n1223\n00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,740\nIf you go into Properties, it shows you\nthings like the hardware information,\n\n1224\n00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,580\nnot really a whole lot we can do in there,\nright?\n\n1225\n00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,650\nSo pretty useless screen, all in all.\n\n1226\n00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:53,160\nBut if we right click on it and we go to\nPrinter Properties, that's the one that\n\n1227\n00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,840\ngives us some better stuff, including\nthe Sharing tab which is what I want.\n\n1228\n00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,360\nAlright, so\nin here I can share the printer.\n\n1229\n00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,600\nIt would have been easier just to share\nit when I was adding the printer, but\n\n1230\n00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,900\nif you already have one this is\nwhere we can go to add it in.\n\n1231\n00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,270\nSo I'm gonna share it.\n\n1232\n00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:09,600\nAnd so it's got that option.\n\n1233\n00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,380\nIt has one neat little\noption here that says,\n\n1234\n00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,220\nRender Print Jobs on Client Computers.\n\n1235\n00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,610\nWhen you do a print job, your document,\nor picture, or web page, or\n\n1236\n00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:21,890\nwhatever it is that you're printing,\nit's in one format.\n\n1237\n00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:26,390\nAnd somebody has to convert it into\na format that's ready for your printer.\n\n1238\n00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,281\nNormally, it's your computer that does it,\n\n1239\n00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:30,272\nwhatever computer's\nattached to the printer.\n\n1240\n00:59:30,272 --> 00:59:32,737\nBut if you're gonna share\nthis with a bunch of people,\n\n1241\n00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:35,470\nyou might not want to bog your\ncomputer down doing that.\n\n1242\n00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,478\nSo you can say, make the other guys do it.\n\n1243\n00:59:37,478 --> 00:59:40,798\nIf they're gonna print, they can\nrender their own print job and it so\n\n1244\n00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:42,930\nit takes a little burden\noff of your system.\n\n1245\n00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:45,430\nIts usually a good idea\nto have that checked.\n\n1246\n00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,980\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\ncheck that off and say, Okay.\n\n1247\n00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,860\nAnd it's gonna share that printer out and\n\n1248\n00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,650\nnotice it's got the two little\npeople icon on there now.\n\n1249\n00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,330\nSo it is shared out and\n\n1250\n00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:02,090\nit's ready to be accessed by\npeople on my network, all right?\n\n1251\n01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:06,420\nSo, there we go it's It's in business,\nit's there, and I can control who can gain\n\n1252\n01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,510\naccess to it, or whatever through\nmy Network and Sharing Center.\n\n1253\n01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:12,920\nSo, I'm gonna go back to my Network and\nSharing Center and\n\n1254\n01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,390\ngo into my Advanced Sharing Settings.\n\n1255\n01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,330\n>> Nice.\n\n1256\n01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:19,490\n>> And in here, we've got file and printer\nsharing, and I can see that file and\n\n1257\n01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,520\nprinter sharing is turned on.\n\n1258\n01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,900\nSo, it's on.\n\n1259\n01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,250\nAnybody who's connected to my little\nnetwork like my home network or\n\n1260\n01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,980\nwhatever will be able to see that.\n\n1261\n01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,600\nNow, Nate, you've got a user\naccount on my computer, so\n\n1262\n01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,830\neven though we're not\njoined to a home group,\n\n1263\n01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:34,600\nyou should be able to browse to my\nmachine and see that printer, right?\n\n1264\n01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,610\nDo you want to give it a shot?\n\n1265\n01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:38,530\n>> Yeah, yeah,\nwell let's jump over to my computer and\n\n1266\n01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:44,270\nI will browse in to Don's computer and\nwe'll connect to his printer.\n\n1267\n01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:45,170\nWe'll fire this guy up.\n\n1268\n01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:45,740\nCome in here.\n\n1269\n01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:53,780\nAnd on Network there is Don's tablet or\nhis laptop.\n\n1270\n01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,580\nAnd sure enough, there is the printer.\n\n1271\n01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:57,420\n>> Yeah, and you know,\n\n1272\n01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,600\nWindows has this really cool feature\nit's called Click and Print.\n\n1273\n01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,420\nThat if Nate wants to\nprint to that printer,\n\n1274\n01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,940\nall he has to do is double-click on it.\n\n1275\n01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,140\nIt'll install it.\n\n1276\n01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,280\nIf he doesn't have the driver,\nit'll copy the driver from my computer.\n\n1277\n01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,450\nNow, I'm running Windows 8.\n\n1278\n01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:15,240\nThe driver that I have from Windows 8\nwill work at least in Windows 8, but\n\n1279\n01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,345\nit might work in Windows 7 also.\n\n1280\n01:01:17,345 --> 01:01:19,885\nWe can load additional drivers for\nother OSs, so\n\n1281\n01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,675\nthey can just click on it and\nit downloads.\n\n1282\n01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:24,015\nNow, I gotta be careful cuz I say,\nother OSs and\n\n1283\n01:01:24,015 --> 01:01:26,815\nwe immediately think like OSX and Linux.\n\n1284\n01:01:26,815 --> 01:01:31,100\nIt's other Microsoft OSs, so Windows 7,\nWindows Vista, even Windows XP.\n\n1285\n01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,000\n32 bit versus 64-bit, right?\n\n1286\n01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,430\nThat's another concern.\n\n1287\n01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,730\nSo, we can load those drivers so\nthat they're available, or,\n\n1288\n01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,370\nthe client can provide them, either way.\n\n1289\n01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,430\nYeah, printer sharing.\n\n1290\n01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,240\nThere you go.\n\n1291\n01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,220\nQuickie, easy and convenient.\n\n1292\n01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:50,360\n>> Yeah, there's not really all that\nmuch to printer sharing, right?\n\n1293\n01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,040\nI mean, we can go in and\nassign printer permissions, but for\n\n1294\n01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,059\nthe most part you want people to\nbe able to print and that's it.\n\n1295\n01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:57,560\nThere's not too much to it.\n\n1296\n01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,850\n>> Yeah, pretty straight forward.\n\n1297\n01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:00,520\n>> All right, so,\n\n1298\n01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,630\nI'm trying to think of anything else we\nmight want to mention on the printer side.\n\n1299\n01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:09,620\nThat's really about it, isn't it?\n\n1300\n01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,640\nYeah.\n\n1301\n01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,950\n>> All so after printers then,\nwe've got the SkyDrive, right?\n\n1302\n01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,180\n>> Yep.\n>> Do you want to get into SkyDrive?\n\n1303\n01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,570\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1304\n01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,830\nSo SkyDrive, it's a cloud service.\n\n1305\n01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:21,970\nIt's a buzzword.\n\n1306\n01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:24,690\nMicrosoft loves talking about this stuff.\n\n1307\n01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,630\nHaving a shared folder on your\nown machine, that's cool, right?\n\n1308\n01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,580\nOther people can access it, that's great.\n\n1309\n01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,370\nBut what happens if your hard drive dies?\n\n1310\n01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:33,590\nWell, your shared data is now gone, right?\n\n1311\n01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:34,300\nYou've lost it.\n\n1312\n01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,270\nSo you gotta have it backed up somewhere.\n\n1313\n01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:38,740\nAlso, what if you have two\ncomputers on different networks?\n\n1314\n01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,160\nSo maybe I'm sharing on a folder,\nbut I go home.\n\n1315\n01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,310\nWell, if I'm at home, and\nNate's here at the studio,\n\n1316\n01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:45,440\nhe can't access my documents anymore,\nright?\n\n1317\n01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,840\nIf you're in two different\ngeographic locations.\n\n1318\n01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,950\nSo the Microsoft SkyDrive\nis a new feature from them\n\n1319\n01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:56,140\nthat gives you a shared folder in\nthe cloud, right, on Microsoft servers.\n\n1320\n01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,680\nAnd, you know,\nthere's security concerns and\n\n1321\n01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,270\nsafety concerns and all that stuff\nwith any kind of cloud service.\n\n1322\n01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:03,980\nBut as far as cloud services go,\nit's pretty solid.\n\n1323\n01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,230\nThey give you, is it seven gigabytes free?\n\n1324\n01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:07,920\n>> Seven gigabytes free, correct.\n\n1325\n01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,960\n>> So you get seven gigabytes\nof storage for free.\n\n1326\n01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,460\nIf you need more, you can buy more.\n\n1327\n01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:15,293\nThey charge, I have no idea how much,\nbut they charge a little bit for it.\n\n1328\n01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:17,243\nBut basically,\nyou can buy more storage, and\n\n1329\n01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:19,520\nyou can put your stuff\nout there on the cloud.\n\n1330\n01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,230\nYou can quickly and easily share it\nwith anybody in the entire world.\n\n1331\n01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:26,210\nThey don't have to be at your\nsystem anymore, or on your network.\n\n1332\n01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:29,970\nAnd they can gain access and\nyou can basically share the resources out.\n\n1333\n01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,250\nYeah, real nice, easy, convenient way\nto share your files across devices,\n\n1334\n01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:40,560\nthings that you've signed on\nwith a Microsoft account.\n\n1335\n01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,440\nAnd with that and you'll sync things up.\n\n1336\n01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,765\nAnd I think let's take a look at it,\nright?\n\n1337\n01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:47,420\n>> Sure.\n\n1338\n01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,820\nNate mentioned a Live account.\n\n1339\n01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:52,430\nAnd Live accounts are free, you can\njust go to live.com and sign up for one.\n\n1340\n01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:56,206\nOr if you already have a Hotmail,\nor Outlook.com, or\n\n1341\n01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:59,417\na Microsoft account,\nany of those work also.\n\n1342\n01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:02,667\nAnd you can use that to login to SkyDrive,\nget your free seven gigs.\n\n1343\n01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:05,750\nIt's integrated in Windows 8, which is\nwhat we're gonna show you right now.\n\n1344\n01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,954\nRight now.\n>> We're gonna start with mine,\n\n1345\n01:04:08,954 --> 01:04:11,140\nstart with yours?\n\n1346\n01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,020\n>> Either way.\nHere, we can pull up mine.\n\n1347\n01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:18,080\nSo if I take mine, and I'm just gonna jump\nto my start screen here in Windows 8,\n\n1348\n01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,610\nand It is installed by default.\n\n1349\n01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:21,390\nI didn't put it there.\n\n1350\n01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:25,610\nSo down at the bottom of my screen I have\na nice little SkyDrive icon right there.\n\n1351\n01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:29,070\nAnd if you go into SkyDrive you'll\nsee anything that you've uploaded or\n\n1352\n01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:30,120\nshared into SkyDrive.\n\n1353\n01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,670\nSo here's my SkyDrive and\nI've got some documents.\n\n1354\n01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:37,560\nNow I'm logged in with my live account and\nso it automatically linked.\n\n1355\n01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,480\nI didn't have to do anything special.\n\n1356\n01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,780\nAnd if I go into my documents I've got\nOne Note installed so that's there.\n\n1357\n01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:49,190\nAnd I've got a folder where during\nthe break I uploaded my pony graph.\n\n1358\n01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:54,110\nSo, I can go in there and there's my\npony picture available for distribution.\n\n1359\n01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:56,910\nI think I'm gonna do a limited edition.\n\n1360\n01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:01,835\nPrint of this and then maybe I'll\ndonate to a charity or something.\n\n1361\n01:05:01,835 --> 01:05:05,270\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, can I get a wallet size?\n\n1362\n01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:06,350\n>> Now we're talking see?\n\n1363\n01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:08,620\n>> So I can put that in my wallet.\n\n1364\n01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,650\n>> It could be people's\ncell phone wallpaper,\n\n1365\n01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,370\nit could really sweep the nation.\n\n1366\n01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:14,990\nSo, anyhow, here's my SkyDrive.\n\n1367\n01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:16,720\nThat's great, right?\n\n1368\n01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,450\nBut the real power of the SkyDrive is when\nwe share it with somebody else, right?\n\n1369\n01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,580\nYou can give somebody else\naccess to the SkyDrive.\n\n1370\n01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:26,000\nNow, I don't have the full\nSkyDrive client installed,\n\n1371\n01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,140\nso I'm somewhat limited in\nwhat I can do from here.\n\n1372\n01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:32,670\nSo I probably need to jump\nover to the actual website.\n\n1373\n01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,330\nDo you have the full client installed?\n\n1374\n01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:34,920\n>> I do.\n\n1375\n01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,700\n>> Why don't we show yours, and\n\n1376\n01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,215\nI'm going to share this out real quick\nfrom the website while you're doing that.\n\n1377\n01:05:39,215 --> 01:05:40,470\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right, sure.\n\n1378\n01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:43,150\nAll right, now with Sky Drive yeah,\n\n1379\n01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:48,890\nyou can browse to their website and\ndownload the Sky Drive\n\n1380\n01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:56,370\ndesktop application to where it then\nwill show up in Windows Explorer.\n\n1381\n01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:58,660\nAnd I've got it pulled up in here.\n\n1382\n01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,600\nSo this is my Sky Drive account.\n\n1383\n01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:08,990\nOn, through your web access, and right on\nthis left hand side down there is PCs.\n\n1384\n01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:13,140\nClick on that, and it will give a link\nto download SkyDrive for Windows, and\n\n1385\n01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:17,270\nit will install on your computer, and\n\n1386\n01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:21,350\nI have done that previously, and\nin Windows Explorer, and there we go.\n\n1387\n01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:25,866\nThere is Sky Drive, and\nthere's all of our stuff.\n\n1388\n01:06:25,866 --> 01:06:28,390\nYou want me to create a folder then?\n\n1389\n01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:32,690\n>> Sure, and anything he creates in there,\nany files he copies over or whatever,\n\n1390\n01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:36,010\nin the background are automatically\nbeing synced up to the cloud.\n\n1391\n01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:40,210\nSo he's got the local copy and he's got\nthe copy up there on Microsoft servers.\n\n1392\n01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,580\nSo if his hard drive fails,\nno big deal, right?\n\n1393\n01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,970\nWe've got the copy up there at Microsoft.\n\n1394\n01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,840\nAnd anytime you make changes,\nthey're automatically synchronized up.\n\n1395\n01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:49,780\nAll right?\n\n1396\n01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:57,210\nLet's see.\nNate, I wanna share some stuff with you.\n\n1397\n01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:58,245\nWhat is your Live ID?\n\n1398\n01:06:58,245 --> 01:07:00,660\n>> Nate.ITPro.TV.\n\n1399\n01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,600\n>> Look at that.\n\n1400\n01:07:05,461 --> 01:07:09,670\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna share a folder with you.\n\n1401\n01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:13,870\nSo, I had that folder called\nDon's Folder or Don's Documents or\n\n1402\n01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:19,020\nwhatever it was and so I've just shared\nit out there with him via the webpage.\n\n1403\n01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:23,080\nAnd he can do it from his client also.\n\n1404\n01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,820\nBut his client will pick that\nup automatically in time, and\n\n1405\n01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,260\nit will synchronize down that folder, and\n\n1406\n01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,850\nthen he'll have access to it's\njust called Don's folder.\n\n1407\n01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:34,340\nSo it will become part of that SkyDrive.\n\n1408\n01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:36,780\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n1409\n01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,560\nactually what you're going to do is you're\ngoing to receive a I think you receive\n\n1410\n01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:43,460\na confirmation email,\ndon't you, if I remember right.\n\n1411\n01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:46,920\nAnd then you have to accept the email or\nwhatever.\n\n1412\n01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,190\nYeah, there it is.\n\n1413\n01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,055\nYou are invited to view Don's photo.\n\n1414\n01:07:50,055 --> 01:07:53,770\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1415\n01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,480\n>> And there it is.\n\n1416\n01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,780\nSo the cool part is that's been\nbrought into his SkyDrive now, and so\n\n1417\n01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,590\nI've Shared that over, and\nif he changes it, I can see the changes.\n\n1418\n01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:05,050\nIf I change it, he can see it.\n\n1419\n01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:09,270\nSo now it's like a shared document, and\nif you're running a small business, or\n\n1420\n01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:12,460\nhome users, or whatever,\nit's kind of cool to have that.\n\n1421\n01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:16,230\nThat collaborative, or\ncollaboration, or whatever\n\n1422\n01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:19,577\nwhere you can share those documents and\neverybody can see each others changes.\n\n1423\n01:08:19,577 --> 01:08:20,105\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1424\n01:08:20,105 --> 01:08:24,550\n>> Yeah you know one thing that what I\nreally like about Sky Drive one of my\n\n1425\n01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:30,040\nfavorite things with\nthat is the all right.\n\n1426\n01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:35,050\nThe use of office web apps.\n\n1427\n01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:40,240\nIn your SkyDrive I can create\na new word document and\n\n1428\n01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:46,509\nwe'll just call this Game Shark Code.\n\n1429\n01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:49,430\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1430\n01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:51,170\n>> Now what's really neat is it.\n\n1431\n01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,090\n>> It comes up here and it's, you know,\ngoodness, you know, more than just basic.\n\n1432\n01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:59,990\nI mean, it's some fairly advanced\nfunctions of word right here on\n\n1433\n01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:02,580\nthe little online Word app.\n\n1434\n01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:05,870\nAnd create stuff, type it up,\nyeah, easy, quick, convent,\n\n1435\n01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,630\nsaves it into the side drive and\nsure enough.\n\n1436\n01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:10,110\n>> And do you get that?\n\n1437\n01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:12,180\nIs that the free one, is that?\n\n1438\n01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:15,050\nCuz I know there's Office 365,\nwhere you get the full web-based apps.\n\n1439\n01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:15,870\nBut they charge for that one.\n\n1440\n01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,240\nRight?\nSo, the part in the sky drive.\n\n1441\n01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,375\nThat's included, right?\n\n1442\n01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:19,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n1443\n01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:19,520\n>> Yep.\n\n1444\n01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,350\n>> So, very cool.\n\n1445\n01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:22,120\nAnd I'd just pulled up the pricing.\n\n1446\n01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,870\nCuz I didn't know how much it\ncost to increase the size.\n\n1447\n01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:26,728\nI got their little pricing\ntable up here on my screen.\n\n1448\n01:09:26,728 --> 01:09:27,918\nVery reasonable.\n\n1449\n01:09:27,918 --> 01:09:28,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1450\n01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,830\n>> So to go to 20 gigs, it's $10 a year.\n\n1451\n01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,620\nBut to go to 100 gigs,\nit's only $50 a year.\n\n1452\n01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:36,400\nDropbox, I think, charges $50 a month or\nsomething for that.\n\n1453\n01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:36,910\n>> Holy cow.\n\n1454\n01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:37,990\n>> Don't they?\nSo\n\n1455\n01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:42,650\nDropbox is considerably more\nexpensive if we wanted to add.\n\n1456\n01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:46,030\nAnd they probably don't make it easy\nto find their pricing, do they?\n\n1457\n01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,660\nBut, yeah, that's actually.\n\n1458\n01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:48,670\nI think.\n\n1459\n01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:49,950\nA very reasonable price.\n\n1460\n01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:53,240\nLet's see what see what\nDropbox charges for 100 gigs.\n\n1461\n01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:58,640\nSo if we wanted to go to, I guess,\n\n1462\n01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,010\nwith the pro plans start at 100 gigs,\nand they start at $9.99 a month.\n\n1463\n01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:04,760\nSo, that would be $120 a year.\n\n1464\n01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,720\nSo, over twice the price of Microsoft.\n\n1465\n01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,500\nSo, Microsoft's being pretty\ncompetitive with their pricing.\n\n1466\n01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,170\nIt's a neat product I personally like\nstoring my files up there in the cloud\n\n1467\n01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:15,830\nbecause I know that they're getting backed\nup and they're stored somewhere safe.\n\n1468\n01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:18,280\nIf my house burns down or\nwhatever, they're out there.\n\n1469\n01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,880\nThe negative side is, you know for\n\n1470\n01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,250\na fact that Microsoft has deals with\nthe NSA and other government agencies.\n\n1471\n01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,580\nWhen your documents are stored in\nthe cloud, and it is not just Microsoft,\n\n1472\n01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,920\nIt's Drop Box, it's Google Drive,\nit's all those guys.\n\n1473\n01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,980\nWhen you store your documents up there,\n\n1474\n01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,410\nthey are secure in that you know\nrandom people can't get to them, but\n\n1475\n01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:41,930\nthey're not private in that you know that\nthat organizations, those companies.\n\n1476\n01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:43,750\nGoogle has access to your Google Drive.\n\n1477\n01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:46,610\nAnd Microsoft has access to\nyour Microsoft Sky Drive.\n\n1478\n01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,750\nSo, they have access to your documents so\n\n1479\n01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,430\nyou wouldn't want to put your deep\ndark personal secrets out there.\n\n1480\n01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,860\nYou wouldn't want to put your\nsocial security number out there\n\n1481\n01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:55,600\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1482\n01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,500\nBut if it's your family photos or\nwhatever.\n\n1483\n01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,350\nThey're perfectly safe.\n\n1484\n01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:00,410\nThey're redundant.\n\n1485\n01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:03,690\nAnd you know that even if your house\nburns down, you still have access to it.\n\n1486\n01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:04,375\nIt's a pretty cool.\n\n1487\n01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:06,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And neat to have.\n\n1488\n01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,220\n>> Yeah.\nAnd easy to share.\n\n1489\n01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:11,300\nYou take pictures of family picnic.\n\n1490\n01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,110\nRight?\n\n1491\n01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,680\nStick it up into your shared.\n\n1492\n01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,700\nSkydrive Photo Album.\n\n1493\n01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:21,350\nAnd then mom and dad over in the other\nstate can go to their Skydrive and\n\n1494\n01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:22,870\nsee all the updated pictures and things.\n\n1495\n01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:27,030\n>> All right I think that's\nreally all we've got on.\n\n1496\n01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:27,570\n>> Skydrive.\n\n1497\n01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,810\nCan you think of anything else\nyou want to mention on that one?\n\n1498\n01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:31,990\n>> No.\n\n1499\n01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:35,840\n>> They do have Skydrive clients for\nApple iOS for the iPad and the iPhone.\n\n1500\n01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,150\nThey have it for Android too.\n\n1501\n01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:40,310\nSo documents you put in your\nSkydrive can be available across\n\n1502\n01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:41,890\npretty much any of your devices.\n\n1503\n01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:44,970\nWe've only got a few minutes\nleft before the break.\n\n1504\n01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:49,380\nThe last thing we have in this objective\nis NFC which really only takes a minute.\n\n1505\n01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,850\nWe can talk about that right now,\ncan't we?\n\n1506\n01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,850\n>> Huh, oh yeah yeah, yep we should.\n\n1507\n01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:57,839\n>> So NFC, Near Field Communications,\nright really we just saw it in cell phones\n\n1508\n01:11:57,839 --> 01:12:02,083\nup until recently, now we are starting\nto see in laptops, right?\n\n1509\n01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:03,333\n>> Yep.\n\n1510\n01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:08,875\nNFC or near field communication,\nit works on a really close distance.\n\n1511\n01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:12,968\nI think that the spec is up to four\ninches, something of that nature.\n\n1512\n01:12:12,968 --> 01:12:18,720\nIt gets your devices close together.\n\n1513\n01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,210\nThey transfer a little bit of data.\n\n1514\n01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,100\nIt is not much.\n\n1515\n01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:25,270\nI believe it's just a few bits or\nbytes of data.\n\n1516\n01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:29,230\nAnd I think it's usually\njust trade keys to\n\n1517\n01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:33,050\nset up like a Wi-Fi direct or\na Bluetooth connection.\n\n1518\n01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,080\n>> That's exactly what it is.\n\n1519\n01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,900\nYeah, and\nif you've seen the Samsung commercials.\n\n1520\n01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,260\nReally show where they take the two\nphones, and they tap them together.\n\n1521\n01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,460\nAnd the video starts\njumping between the two.\n\n1522\n01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:46,970\nWith NFC, it's designed for very short\ndistance, very small amounts of data.\n\n1523\n01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:49,080\nAnd the key is you're exactly right.\n\n1524\n01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:49,960\nThat's how it works.\n\n1525\n01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,420\nThat you tap them together,\nthey exchange a key.\n\n1526\n01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,900\nAnd then they find some other way to talk.\n\n1527\n01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:58,610\nAnd that other way is\nalmost always Wi-Fi direct.\n\n1528\n01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:01,370\nSo they build a Wi-Fi\nconnection between each other\n\n1529\n01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:04,110\nusing that key they just\nexchanged with NFC.\n\n1530\n01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:07,950\nSo NFC doesn't actually\ntransmit your files.\n\n1531\n01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,320\nNFC really just sets up a communication\nis what it does, right?\n\n1532\n01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:15,020\nSo NFC is like that friend\nat a party that doesn't\n\n1533\n01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,920\nactually help you go out\non a date with a girl.\n\n1534\n01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,000\nBut just introduces you to the girl,\nright?\n\n1535\n01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,470\nAnd that's what NFC,\nNFC is our on-train nuke, right?\n\n1536\n01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,093\nSo, to use party terms.\n\n1537\n01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:26,730\nSo, [LAUGH] and so\n\n1538\n01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:30,085\nwe, that's all we've ever talking\nabout during the breaks today.\n\n1539\n01:13:30,085 --> 01:13:31,605\nIt seems like it's party terms.\n\n1540\n01:13:31,605 --> 01:13:34,095\nBut, and pony grabs I guess, so.\n\n1541\n01:13:34,095 --> 01:13:35,815\nMaybe that could become a party term.\n\n1542\n01:13:35,815 --> 01:13:36,839\nI don't know.\nWe'll work that out.\n\n1543\n01:13:36,839 --> 01:13:38,671\n>> Yeah, like hey,\nI'm having a party grab.\n\n1544\n01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:41,165\n>> [LAUGH] So, maybe not.\n\n1545\n01:13:41,165 --> 01:13:45,630\nAll right, but anyhow, so\nNFC just introduces the devices.\n\n1546\n01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,130\nAnd allows them to establish that\nsecure session via Wi-Fi direct.\n\n1547\n01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,520\nAnd you can do Bluetooth.\n\n1548\n01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,710\nThe ones I've done have\nalways been Wi-Fi direct.\n\n1549\n01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:57,020\nAnd then you can exchange files very, very\nfast and even as the devices move apart.\n\n1550\n01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,370\nSo in those Samsung commercials, you'll\nsee those phones spread out really far.\n\n1551\n01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:01,740\nAnd you're like,\nhow the heck is that working?\n\n1552\n01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,770\nNFC can only go a few inches.\n\n1553\n01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:06,140\nNFC's job is already done, right?\n\n1554\n01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:09,510\nWe can also use NFC to cause\ncertain events to occur.\n\n1555\n01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:12,810\nSo for example, you can set\n\n1556\n01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:18,180\ndifferent power timeouts based on\nwhether you've hit an NFC tag.\n\n1557\n01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,960\nAnd I know we do it on phones a lot.\n\n1558\n01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,300\nLaptops and\nstuff are just starting to evolve to this.\n\n1559\n01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,338\nSo you get third-party\nsoftware that can manage it.\n\n1560\n01:14:24,338 --> 01:14:27,514\nWhere if your laptop comes\nin contact with an NFC tag,\n\n1561\n01:14:27,514 --> 01:14:31,338\nit gets wireless configurations\nto join the wireless network.\n\n1562\n01:14:31,338 --> 01:14:35,046\nOr it exchanges a vCard or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n1563\n01:14:35,046 --> 01:14:36,796\nIt's all, vCards.\n\n1564\n01:14:36,796 --> 01:14:41,510\n[LAUGH] Anyhow, so\nspeaking of party terms.\n\n1565\n01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:47,160\nSo it is still a very evolving technology,\nit's not very mature.\n\n1566\n01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,429\nIf your laptop doesn't\nhave NFC built into it,\n\n1567\n01:14:50,429 --> 01:14:55,180\nthere's a couple of little NFC\ntransmitters that you can buy add on.\n\n1568\n01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,680\nBut they're not very common.\n\n1569\n01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,030\nSo it's something we'll see more over\nthe next couple of years I think.\n\n1570\n01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:01,480\nOr something we'll see\nthe completely die out.\n\n1571\n01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,020\nAnd disappear in the next\nversion of Windows.\n\n1572\n01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,882\nYou just never know with\na new technology like this.\n\n1573\n01:15:05,882 --> 01:15:10,790\n>> Mm-hm, yep, Windows 8 does\ninclude built-in support for NFC for\n\n1574\n01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,300\nsetting those things up.\n\n1575\n01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,300\nMy laptop here does not have NFC built in.\n\n1576\n01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,570\nOtherwise we'd go through and\npair it to something and show it off.\n\n1577\n01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:21,880\nBut since I don't have that\nfunctionality built in.\n\n1578\n01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:26,340\nI don't have those menus and\nthose options built in here.\n\n1579\n01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,280\nAnd so it's a little hard to demo.\n\n1580\n01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,980\nWe don't have any NFC built into it.\n\n1581\n01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:31,964\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1582\n01:15:31,964 --> 01:15:35,065\n>> But, yeah, it's an emergent thing and\n\n1583\n01:15:35,065 --> 01:15:39,089\nwe'll see more if it as the years come by,\nand yeah.\n\n1584\n01:15:39,089 --> 01:15:42,880\n>> All right, so\nI think that's all we really have on NFC.\n\n1585\n01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,630\nNot too much crazy stuff to go on there.\n\n1586\n01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,671\nJust be aware that\nWindows 8 does have that.\n\n1587\n01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:49,980\nI think that's about as detailed\nas they'd get on the exam.\n\n1588\n01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,610\nAll right, we're right at the break\npoint here so why don't we stop.\n\n1589\n01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:57,588\nWhen we get back we're gonna talk\na little bit about EFS, and NTFS.\n\n1590\n01:15:57,588 --> 01:16:00,875\nAnd a couple other acronyms that\nwe can come up with to think of.\n\n1591\n01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:03,245\nSo we'll tackle that, stay tuned.\n\n1592\n01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:04,820\nGot anything else to throw in?\n\n1593\n01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:05,880\n>> I'm good for now.\n\n1594\n01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,130\n>> All right, so we'll see you\nguys back in just a few minutes.\n\n1595\n01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:15,838\n[MUSIC]\n\n1596\n01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:18,640\n[LAUGH] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1597\n01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,320\nSo we left off talking about stuff.\n\n1598\n01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,980\nAnd now we're gonna talk about more stuff.\n\n1599\n01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,518\nSo we've got excellent direction for\nthe show.\n\n1600\n01:16:24,518 --> 01:16:29,022\n[LAUGH] So,\nEFS was the thing that I threw out last.\n\n1601\n01:16:29,022 --> 01:16:31,262\nThe encrypting file system,\n\n1602\n01:16:31,262 --> 01:16:35,960\nwhich is a really cool feature\nin my opinion of Windows.\n\n1603\n01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,700\nSo let's talk a little bit about it,\nright?\n\n1604\n01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,150\nWhen you store your files\non your hard drive,\n\n1605\n01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:43,670\nif you have an NTFS partition, right?\n\n1606\n01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:46,550\nIf your hard drive's been\nformatted using the NT or\n\n1607\n01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:49,600\nNew Technology File System, NTFS.\n\n1608\n01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:53,465\nThen you got some neat features like\nfile permissions and compression.\n\n1609\n01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:56,190\nAnd EFS, the encrypting file system.\n\n1610\n01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,190\nIf somebody were to\nbreak into your home or\n\n1611\n01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:01,870\nyour office,\nrip the hard drive outta your computer.\n\n1612\n01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:05,820\nTake it back to their home and add it as\na second hard drive to their machine.\n\n1613\n01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:09,525\nIn theory they could override your\npermissions and access your documents.\n\n1614\n01:17:09,525 --> 01:17:15,425\nEFS allows you to encrypt individual files\nto ensure that's not a problem, right?\n\n1615\n01:17:15,425 --> 01:17:19,005\nThere are other technologies like\nBitLocker that we'll talk about later.\n\n1616\n01:17:19,005 --> 01:17:22,980\nBitLocker will let you\nencrypt an entire hard drive.\n\n1617\n01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:26,945\nEFS is just if we wanna encrypt\na handful of files or folders.\n\n1618\n01:17:26,945 --> 01:17:33,340\n>> Mm-hm, yep, EFS,\nit uses the user's certificate.\n\n1619\n01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,780\nAnd I was talking to Don earlier, and\n\n1620\n01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:39,080\nit will browse to get real\ndeep into certificates.\n\n1621\n01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,000\nThat'll be a little later.\n\n1622\n01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,469\nBut each user that signs\non the computer has the.\n\n1623\n01:17:44,469 --> 01:17:48,499\nThe first time they choose to\nencrypt a file it generates\n\n1624\n01:17:48,499 --> 01:17:51,870\na certificate that it is tied to.\n\n1625\n01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:53,570\nAnd when you encrypt,\n\n1626\n01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:58,770\ndecrypt stuff it uses that certificate\nthing, and why not, right?\n\n1627\n01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:00,440\nI almost lost my train of thought.\n\n1628\n01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,160\nI was thinking that-\n>> Good stuff.\n\n1629\n01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,730\nAll right, so the point is, though,\nif there's a physical compromise.\n\n1630\n01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:09,300\nIf someone physically steals\nthe drive out of your system.\n\n1631\n01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,120\nEFS can protect your\nmost sensitive documents.\n\n1632\n01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,590\nNow encryption involves things\nlike digital certificates and\n\n1633\n01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:16,500\nsignatures and all of that.\n\n1634\n01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,755\nIt sounds really complex.\n\n1635\n01:18:17,755 --> 01:18:20,421\nEFS is super easy, all right?\n\n1636\n01:18:20,421 --> 01:18:22,220\nLet me give you an example.\n\n1637\n01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,088\nWe're just gonna run with\nthis thing the whole episode.\n\n1638\n01:18:25,088 --> 01:18:27,255\nWe're gonna go right back\nto our pony grabs, right?\n\n1639\n01:18:27,255 --> 01:18:30,630\nSo I've my shared folder\nthat Nate has access to.\n\n1640\n01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:32,010\nAnd let me just browse into that.\n\n1641\n01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:36,420\nSo, it's in my fraps folder and\ninside of screenshots.\n\n1642\n01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:39,880\nAnd here I've made two\ncopies of the Pony Grab.\n\n1643\n01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,510\nRight, so I've already started\nmaking counterfeit copies.\n\n1644\n01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,720\nAnd I've just renamed them.\n\n1645\n01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,860\nSo one of them is called\nPony Grab Encrypted,\n\n1646\n01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,780\nthe other one is Pony Grab Unencrypted.\n\n1647\n01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:51,920\nThey're actually both unencrypted\nright now, all right?\n\n1648\n01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,290\nIf I want to encrypt a file on my\nhard drive, it's super simple.\n\n1649\n01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:59,800\nFirst off, I have to have an NTFS drive,\nall right?\n\n1650\n01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,320\nHow do I know if I'm formatted NTFS?\n\n1651\n01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,620\nWell, the easiest way is find the drive\nletter, so I'm on my C drive.\n\n1652\n01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,410\nAnd you can just right-click on it,\nand choose Properties.\n\n1653\n01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:14,860\nAnd in the Properties here,\nit will tell you file system, NTFS.\n\n1654\n01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:17,210\nIn Windows you'll normally\nsee one of two things.\n\n1655\n01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,500\nYou'll use the fat 32, or NTFS.\n\n1656\n01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:26,005\nThere are some other ones that might creep\nup like exFAT, or FAT16, God forbid.\n\n1657\n01:19:26,005 --> 01:19:29,505\nSo there might be some like that, but\nnormally you're gonna see FAT32 or NTFS.\n\n1658\n01:19:29,505 --> 01:19:34,250\nDoesn't really matter what it is as long\nas it's the only one that works, NTFS.\n\n1659\n01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:40,980\nSo if you wanna do EFS it's got to\nbe NTFS at this option, all right?\n\n1660\n01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,430\nThen you just figure out\nwhat you wanna encrypt.\n\n1661\n01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,780\nIf wanna encrypt a whole folder,\n\n1662\n01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,020\nthen we need to pull up\nthe properties of that folder.\n\n1663\n01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:50,300\nIf we just wanna encrypt one file.\n\n1664\n01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:52,970\nLike I wanna encrypt just this one.\n\n1665\n01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:55,875\nWe can right-click on it and\nchoose Properties.\n\n1666\n01:19:55,875 --> 01:20:01,000\nAnd in the Properties screen we've got\nthis little Advanced button down here.\n\n1667\n01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,543\nAnd under Advanced we'll\nsee the option that I want.\n\n1668\n01:20:03,543 --> 01:20:06,917\nYou've got Compress contents or\nEncrypt contents.\n\n1669\n01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:09,720\nCompress makes it take less\nspace on the hard drive.\n\n1670\n01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,070\nEncrypt will encrypt it.\n\n1671\n01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:15,850\nNow the reason I mention compress right\nnow, is you can only do one or the other.\n\n1672\n01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:16,850\nYou can't do both.\n\n1673\n01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,100\nYou can't compress and encrypt.\n\n1674\n01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,570\nSo you gotta pick one or the other.\n\n1675\n01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:21,910\nOr neither, right?\n\n1676\n01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:25,030\nI'm gonna choose encrypt, all right?\n\n1677\n01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:28,120\nWhen I say OK to that It's\ngoing to encrypt the file.\n\n1678\n01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,310\nNow, how do I know?\n\n1679\n01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:31,190\nOh, actually, one little thing here.\n\n1680\n01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:34,540\nIf its just a single file, that's it.\n\n1681\n01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:39,840\nBut the default is, if it's a folder it\ncan encrypt the contents inside of it.\n\n1682\n01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:45,110\nBecause I picked a file it's offering, do\nI want to encrypt the whole folder also?\n\n1683\n01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,950\nNow I don't want to.\n\n1684\n01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:49,681\nI just want to do this one file so\nI'll choose it, and hit OK.\n\n1685\n01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,960\nAll right, how do I know it's encrypted?\n\n1686\n01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,110\nWell, when you encrypt a file in Windows,\n\n1687\n01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:02,150\nthe file name changes to be written\nin green, so they're easy to spot.\n\n1688\n01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:04,790\nSee how the one on the left is green and\nthe one on the right is not?\n\n1689\n01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:06,270\nThe one on the left is encrypted.\n\n1690\n01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,790\nThe one on the right is not.\n\n1691\n01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:10,450\nIf I compress,\nthe compressed files actually turn blue.\n\n1692\n01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:15,890\nSo, you can spot compressed files versus\nencrypted files versus regular files.\n\n1693\n01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:20,400\nNow, if any of you guys have watched my\nnetwork shows like the security plus show\n\n1694\n01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,340\nor the network plus show, you will know\nthat I do not trust operating systems.\n\n1695\n01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,940\nSo, how do we really\nknow it is It' encrypted.\n\n1696\n01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,990\nWell, Nate, you've got access\nto this folder of the network.\n\n1697\n01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:32,760\nWhy don't you try and access these files.\n\n1698\n01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,480\nLet's trip over to Nate's machine.\n\n1699\n01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,090\n>> All right, yeah, sure.\n\n1700\n01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:37,340\nDa da dum.\n\n1701\n01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,780\nAnd all the Windows Explorer.\n\n1702\n01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:45,746\nBack to network, theres Don's laptop.\n\n1703\n01:21:45,746 --> 01:21:50,320\nAnd Fraps, screen shots,\n>> And\n\n1704\n01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,760\nnotice how he can see that\nit's green also, right?\n\n1705\n01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,030\n>> Wrong one.\n\n1706\n01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,510\n>> Oh, that was the, well,\nno, good test right there.\n\n1707\n01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:59,870\nSo he opened the unencrypted one,\nand it opened just fine.\n\n1708\n01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:02,250\nHe got my pink pony, right?\n\n1709\n01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,635\nBut then when he tried to open\nthe encrypted one, not so good right?\n\n1710\n01:22:05,635 --> 01:22:07,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1711\n01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:10,910\nWindows Photo Viewer can't open this\npicture because you don't have the correct\n\n1712\n01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:13,185\npermissions to access the file location.\n\n1713\n01:22:13,185 --> 01:22:14,250\nOkay.\nIt's encrypted.\n\n1714\n01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:17,340\nIt cannot read this picture and\nopen it up.\n\n1715\n01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n1716\n01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:19,470\nIf you was to force it open,\n\n1717\n01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:23,080\nwhich you used to be able to do\nwith the DOS Editor or whatever,\n\n1718\n01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:27,810\nIf you were to force it open, it's just\na jumbled mess of hash keys, right?\n\n1719\n01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,980\nBut your software here\nrecognizes that too, and\n\n1720\n01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,560\nthat's where it says you don't\nhave the right permissions.\n\n1721\n01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,550\nAnd by the right permissions,\n\n1722\n01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:37,410\nwhat that means is he doesn't\nhave the right encryption key.\n\n1723\n01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,160\nNow, you guys watched me do that.\n\n1724\n01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,980\nDid I create an encryption key?\n\n1725\n01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:43,320\nNo.\nIt was all done under the hood.\n\n1726\n01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,270\nWindows took care of that for me.\n\n1727\n01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,750\nIt's now encrypting that file.\n\n1728\n01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:50,770\nNow, we have to be careful\nif this is a USB key.\n\n1729\n01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:53,450\nIf I just encrypted\nthe file onto a USB key and\n\n1730\n01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:55,990\nI tote that file out somewhere else.\n\n1731\n01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:57,960\nWhen I plug in into another computer,\n\n1732\n01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,150\nI'm not gonna be able to open that file,\nright?\n\n1733\n01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:04,520\nSo we do have to be careful when it's\nencrypted, it is encrypted with a key, and\n\n1734\n01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:07,490\nwe can actually see that key, and\nit's a good idea to back it up, right?\n\n1735\n01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:09,980\nLet me show you the key.\n\n1736\n01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,310\nLet's switch back to my computer.\n\n1737\n01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:14,710\nIn the encryption keys,\nthey're actually certificates.\n\n1738\n01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:18,490\nDigital certificates that\nare used to encrypt the file.\n\n1739\n01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:23,610\nAnd in Windows there's not really\na good way by default to see those so\n\n1740\n01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:27,110\nI'm gonna have to do what's\ncalled creating a custom MMC.\n\n1741\n01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:30,580\nAn MMC is\na Microsoft Management Console and\n\n1742\n01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:33,620\nyou can just like bring\nup your start screen.\n\n1743\n01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:35,120\nWhoop there we go.\n\n1744\n01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,060\nAnd type in MMC.\n\n1745\n01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,900\nAnd you'll see it right there, mmc.exe.\n\n1746\n01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,710\nI'm going to run that.\n\n1747\n01:23:45,309 --> 01:23:50,194\nAnd then I'll just go to file,\nadd/remove snap-in, and\n\n1748\n01:23:50,194 --> 01:23:54,060\nyou'll see a snap-in for certificates.\n\n1749\n01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:57,400\nNow, you have certificates for your local\ncomputer, as well as certificates for\n\n1750\n01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,530\nyour user account.\n\n1751\n01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:00,980\nThe FS is tied to the user account.\n\n1752\n01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,900\nSo, I'm gonna choose my user account and\nfinish that up.\n\n1753\n01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:06,380\nAll right.\n\n1754\n01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,560\nNow I can see all the certificates\ntied to my user account.\n\n1755\n01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:13,700\nI'm going to go into personal,\nand certificates.\n\n1756\n01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,640\nSo I can see a couple of certificates.\n\n1757\n01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:19,968\nI've got some kind of token signing public\nkey which is Client authentication.\n\n1758\n01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:21,443\nThat's probably part of the home group.\n\n1759\n01:24:21,443 --> 01:24:22,988\nBut then I've got this guy right here.\n\n1760\n01:24:22,988 --> 01:24:24,251\nIssued to Don.\n\n1761\n01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:26,248\nIssued by Don.\n\n1762\n01:24:26,248 --> 01:24:33,725\nIssued on 8/27, oh expires on 8/27/2113,\nso it's good for 100 years.\n\n1763\n01:24:33,725 --> 01:24:37,885\nAnd it's for\nthe encrypting file system EFS.\n\n1764\n01:24:37,885 --> 01:24:38,530\nOkay.\n\n1765\n01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:43,030\nI didn't make that,\nWindows made it for me.\n\n1766\n01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:47,600\nSo anytime I encrypt a file Windows is\ngonna used that to go ahead and encrypt it\n\n1767\n01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,690\nfor me, and all of my files will be\nencrypted with this key right here.\n\n1768\n01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:58,300\nIf I wanna back it up, I can just right\nclick on it, go to all tasks and export.\n\n1769\n01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,500\nI can export that key.\n\n1770\n01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,860\nWhen we export it, it's real important\nthat we pay attention to a couple of\n\n1771\n01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:06,150\noptions, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nwalk through Through this process.\n\n1772\n01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:08,890\nWe are gonna see certificates more\nin depth, like in the server show.\n\n1773\n01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:10,190\nBut here in the workstation side,\n\n1774\n01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,640\nI just want to show you guys\nthis because it is important.\n\n1775\n01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:17,450\nWhen you move forward, it asks if you want\nto export the private key, all right.\n\n1776\n01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:20,160\nBy default it just exports the public key.\n\n1777\n01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,330\nYou can use the public\nkey to encrypt things,\n\n1778\n01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:26,370\nyou can't use the public\nkey to decrypt things.\n\n1779\n01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:31,370\nSo you need to export the private key,\notherwise this key is useless, all right?\n\n1780\n01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:33,150\nSo real important there.\n\n1781\n01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:34,480\nSo I'm gonna export the private key.\n\n1782\n01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:39,570\nThe default format is a PFX and\nthat's the way we want it,\n\n1783\n01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:41,310\nthe Personal Information Exchange.\n\n1784\n01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:43,660\nThat'll include the private key and\npublic key.\n\n1785\n01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:47,030\nThese other formats usually just\ninclude the public key and so\n\n1786\n01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,060\nthat's why they're grayed out.\n\n1787\n01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:52,090\nWe have to option to delete\nthe private key if we want.\n\n1788\n01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:53,130\nWe don't want to do that.\n\n1789\n01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:58,360\nBut we do want to include all certificates\nin the certification path if possible.\n\n1790\n01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,060\nWe see the encryption key here, but\n\n1791\n01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:03,680\nthere's also a root certificate that's\ninvolved, and we need that too.\n\n1792\n01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:05,600\nBy leaving this option checked,\nyou'll get that.\n\n1793\n01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,520\nIt's checked by default, so we're covered.\n\n1794\n01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:12,910\nAll right, you do have to set a password.\n\n1795\n01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:16,460\nIf you export the private key,\nyou've got to assign a password.\n\n1796\n01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:17,820\nIt can be whatever you want.\n\n1797\n01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:21,450\nDon't forget what it is, but\npick something reasonable.\n\n1798\n01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:23,050\nI'm just using the word password.\n\n1799\n01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,990\nAnd then we can choose to\nsave it somewhere, right?\n\n1800\n01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:30,157\nSo I can save it,\nI'll save it maybe to my desktop.\n\n1801\n01:26:35,997 --> 01:26:38,640\nAll right, and\nnow I've gotta back up that key.\n\n1802\n01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,300\nNow be really careful.\n\n1803\n01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:44,010\nIf anyone gets ahold of that file and\nguesses your password.\n\n1804\n01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:48,260\nThey've now got your private key and\nthey can decrypt your content.\n\n1805\n01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:49,740\nThat's a real problem.\n\n1806\n01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:51,400\nSo we do wanna be careful with that.\n\n1807\n01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,520\nBut we've got a back up now,\nso if something happens and\n\n1808\n01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:59,210\nour operating system dies or whatever,\nwe'll be able to recover our content.\n\n1809\n01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,150\nAssuming you've got\nthe certificate installed,\n\n1810\n01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:03,240\ndecrypting the files is really easy.\n\n1811\n01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,700\nYou just pull up their properties,\nyou go into advanced, and\n\n1812\n01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:10,970\nyou remove that encrypted\ncontent checkmark.\n\n1813\n01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:14,840\nWhen you remove it now the file\ngoes back to being black.\n\n1814\n01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,860\nAnd it's no longer encrypted.\n\n1815\n01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:21,350\n>> Yep, so back at those encryption keys.\n\n1816\n01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:24,170\nI'll tell you a little story.\n\n1817\n01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:28,360\nSo, I had this computer and\nI had these documents and\n\n1818\n01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:32,160\nI encrypted and they just kind of sat\nthere and I never really needed them or\n\n1819\n01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,710\nused anything with them in awhile.\n\n1820\n01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:37,160\nAnd there came a time where\nI formatted my computer and\n\n1821\n01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:41,680\nI didn't back up those keys and\nthose files to this day remain locked.\n\n1822\n01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,640\nThey said, I should probably just\ndelete them but they just sit there.\n\n1823\n01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:49,473\nI have no way,\nI did not back up that certificate,\n\n1824\n01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:52,500\nand I have no way to, yeah, get those.\n\n1825\n01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,371\nIn these days,\nnow like on my computer tax documents,\n\n1826\n01:27:56,371 --> 01:28:01,085\ncredit stuff things that gives us\nall this personal information,\n\n1827\n01:28:01,085 --> 01:28:05,964\nI have now, a back up of those keys,\nI put a little micro USB SD card And\n\n1828\n01:28:05,964 --> 01:28:09,836\nhave that tucked away, so\nif anything were to happen,\n\n1829\n01:28:09,836 --> 01:28:13,590\nI'll have those backed up and\noff the computer.\n\n1830\n01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:17,920\nIf anything happened to it,\nI'd, yep, have those.\n\n1831\n01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,880\n>> Another thing worth mentioning here,\nwhat I just showed you,\n\n1832\n01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,810\nthat's a proprietary Microsoft thing.\n\n1833\n01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:27,950\nThis form of encryption, those keys,\nthis is a Microsoft only technology.\n\n1834\n01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:33,380\nDon't tell Microsoft, but personally,\nI like to use TrueCrypt instead\n\n1835\n01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:38,270\nbecause I know that TrueCrypt will\nwork on Windows, LSX, and LINUX.\n\n1836\n01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:40,690\nSo now, if I decide to move\nto another operating system,\n\n1837\n01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:43,030\nI can still leave my files encrypted.\n\n1838\n01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:46,790\nIf you use the Microsoft method, this way,\nand you decide that you want to move over\n\n1839\n01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:50,600\nto a Mac, you've got to\ndecrypt all your files first.\n\n1840\n01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,540\nAnd then move to a Mac and\nreencrypt their way.\n\n1841\n01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,750\nSo there are different options out there.\n\n1842\n01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,350\nThe other thing I wanna point out\nis when I encrypted this file and\n\n1843\n01:28:57,350 --> 01:29:01,230\nwhen I decrypted it, it was very fast,\nright, but that's because it was one file.\n\n1844\n01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,500\nIf you do an entire directory or\n\n1845\n01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,850\na large quantity of data, it can take\nhours to encrypt all that content.\n\n1846\n01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:10,160\nSo, be ready for that.\n\n1847\n01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,700\nIf you're gonna be\nencrypting a lot of stuff,\n\n1848\n01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:15,340\na bitlocker volume is\nusually the better option.\n\n1849\n01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:15,840\nRight?\n\n1850\n01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,420\nBut if you're just encrypting\na handful of files,\n\n1851\n01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:23,120\njust a few really sensitive things,\nEFS is fast, easy, and it's secure.\n\n1852\n01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:26,280\n>> Yeah.\n\n1853\n01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,950\n>> I think that's about it for EFS.\n\n1854\n01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:30,870\nWe do tackle it again on the server\nside because when you have an active\n\n1855\n01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:35,720\ndirectory domain, domain admins have\na special recover key they can use to\n\n1856\n01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:40,000\nrecover encrypted files for their users,\nand so that's some kind of special stuff.\n\n1857\n01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,525\nWe don't worry about that so\nmuch on the Windows 8 exam.\n\n1858\n01:29:43,525 --> 01:29:48,190\n>> Yeah, I think as far as the scope of\nwhat we're after, I mean, that's how to do\n\n1859\n01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:54,640\nit, how to undo it, and how to back\nit up so you can get back to it.\n\n1860\n01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:55,620\nExcellent.\n\n1861\n01:29:55,620 --> 01:30:00,050\nYou know Nate, as far as I can tell, that\nis pretty much all we need to get through.\n\n1862\n01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:03,010\nThe next thing on our list is NTFS\npermissions, but we definitely don't have\n\n1863\n01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:06,840\nenough time on the show to tackle that, so\nwe'll have to catch that one next episode.\n\n1864\n01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,470\nDo you have any words of wisdom you wanna\nimpart on the masses before we wrap up?\n\n1865\n01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:12,870\n>> You put me on the spot.\n\n1866\n01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:14,670\n>> I bet you were gonna try and\nthink of something witty.\n\n1867\n01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:19,910\n>> Yeah, I was but\nI think for the sake of, no.\n\n1868\n01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:21,200\n>> No, all right, excellent.\n\n1869\n01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,470\nSo good summary [LAUGH].\n\n1870\n01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:24,230\nSo, all right.\n\n1871\n01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:27,530\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,

learn\n\n3\n00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,990\nwithout even knowing it.\n\n4\n00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,650\nI'm Mike Roderick and\nI'm here with my good buddy Nate.\n\n5\n00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,240\n>> Howdy.\n\n6\n00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,320\n>> Today we're gonna be going over\nconfiguring file and folder level access.\n\n7\n00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,050\nRight?\n\n8\n00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,942\nLots of fun here.\n\n9\n00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:53,810\nGet to go over some NTFS permissions and\nsome disk quotas and\n\n10\n00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,140\nwhat other are we gonna do?\n\n11\n00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,960\nWe got disk quotas and\nconfigure object access auditing.\n\n12\n00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,570\n>> Auditing.\n\n13\n00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,340\nSweet, sweet.\n\n14\n00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,730\n>> Find out who's going where.\n\n15\n00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,740\n>> Yeah.\nSee what's going on in that machine.\n\n16\n00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,350\nSo, again good topic today.\n\n17\n00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,200\nLove, love my NTFS Permissions and\nit's an important topic, right?\n\n18\n00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,788\nThis is one that is going\nto be on this exam and\n\n19\n00:01:15,788 --> 00:01:19,100\nNTFS permissions are gonna\naffect you on all the exams.\n\n20\n00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,560\nMaybe not a direct permission question.\n\n21\n00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,750\nBut if you don't understand the way\npermissions work, the way they inherit,\n\n22\n00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,480\nthe way they combine,\n\n23\n00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,526\nyou'll have trouble with some of\nthe questions on most of the exams.\n\n24\n00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:33,160\nSo, important topic to make sure\nwe understand the way all of these\n\n25\n00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,855\npermissions work.\n\n26\n00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:37,160\nCuz really when it comes down to it,\nas an IT person,\n\n27\n00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,540\nthis is one of our major jobs functions\nis to control access to the data.\n\n28\n00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,290\nMaking sure that my users can get to\nwhat they need to do their job but\n\n29\n00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,595\nthey can't get to stuff that\nthey're not supposed to get to.\n\n30\n00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:53,280\nSo the catch phrase is making sure that\nthey can access what they need and\n\n31\n00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,480\nin a secure fashion.\n\n32\n00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> That is our goal for today.\n\n33\n00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,570\n>> So if I have a folder\nthat has files that I don't\n\n34\n00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,310\nparticularly want anybody else looking at.\n\n35\n00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,900\nThen I can set these NTF and\nNTFS permissions on the folder and\n\n36\n00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,140\nrestrict access to who\nis able to access it.\n\n37\n00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,240\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n38\n00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,420\nAnd we've covered in the,\nI believe in our A+ segments we've talked\n\n39\n00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,610\nabout the different files\nsystems that you can use,\n\n40\n00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,610\nthat you can partition\nyour hard drive with.\n\n41\n00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,160\nFAT, FAT32 and NTFS.\n\n42\n00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,230\nAnd we say NTFS, why do we like NTFS?\n\n43\n00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,330\nWhy is it the file system of choice?\n\n44\n00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,370\nAnd it's because of that file and\nfolder level access.\n\n45\n00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,740\nBecause I can restrict who\ncan access those resources.\n\n46\n00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,810\nUsing our,\nwhat's called an access control list.\n\n47\n00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,050\nGood stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,234\nSo should we dive right into it,\nsee what we've got?\n\n49\n00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:46,190\n>> I think so.\n>> You guys ready for\n\n50\n00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,208\nsome fun with some NTFS.\n\n51\n00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,647\n>> Mm-hmm, yeah.\n\n52\n00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:49,728\nOh, were you.\n\n53\n00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,136\n>> [CROSSTALK] Want to make sure you\nguys out there are ready and excited.\n\n54\n00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:56,120\n>> Yep.\n>> All right.\n\n55\n00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,060\nSo, again, with NTFS, the first\nthing we should understand, I guess,\n\n56\n00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,780\nis when you format a drive with NTFS\nfile system, all the objects that\n\n57\n00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,895\nexist on that drive are going to have\nwhat's known as an access control list.\n\n58\n00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:12,820\nNow, technically,\nif we wanna get technical, and\n\n59\n00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,345\nwe should for the exam, right?\n\n60\n00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:17,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a discretionary access\n\n61\n00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,140\ncontrol list.\n\n62\n00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,630\nYou'll see it abbreviated as DACL.\n\n63\n00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,950\nA lot of people will just\nsay the word DACL, but\n\n64\n00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,110\na lot of people will also just leave the D\noff because it's kind of understood.\n\n65\n00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,220\nWe'll say access control list but\nto be correct,\n\n66\n00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,035\nit's a discretionary access control list.\n\n67\n00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:32,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n68\n00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,720\n>> And it's discretionary,\n\n69\n00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,930\nwe've talked in some other episodes about\ndifferent types of controls, right?\n\n70\n00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,750\nMandatory access control,\nwhat's another one?\n\n71\n00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,598\n>> Discretionary access control.\n\n72\n00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,070\n>> Discretionary access control, rule\nbased control, role based access control.\n\n73\n00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,930\nDiscretionary access control means that\nwhen you create an object in NTFS,\n\n74\n00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,420\nyou are the creator-owner of that object.\n\n75\n00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,310\nAnd that means if you're\nthe creator-owner, you get full control.\n\n76\n00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,030\nAnd full control is gonna allow you to\nchange the access control list itself.\n\n77\n00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,240\nSo if you make a file then you can go\nto the access control list and decide\n\n78\n00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,880\nwho should or who shouldn't have access\nto that file its at your discretion.\n\n79\n00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,400\nHence the name discretionary\naccess control list right.\n\n80\n00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,480\nSo let's take a peek at one.\n\n81\n00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,940\nLet's see if we can get my screen up here.\n\n82\n00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,330\n>> So within the access control lists,\nyou have access control entries.\n\n83\n00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,960\nAnd it's those entries in\nthere they you assign.\n\n84\n00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,630\nAnd I guess we'll look at it.\n\n85\n00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,070\n>> I think we are.\n\n86\n00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,890\nSo what I'm going to do\nhere is on my desktop,\n\n87\n00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,080\nI'm just going to do it on my desktop.\n\n88\n00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,902\nAnd I'm just going to make a new folder\nand let's call this folder test.\n\n89\n00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:52,130\nAll right.\n\n90\n00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,540\nSo now I've got a folder here.\n\n91\n00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,780\nI'm going to right-click on that\nfolder and choose properties.\n\n92\n00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,140\nAnd open up the properties for\nthis folder.\n\n93\n00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,850\nAnd then I'm going to\ngo to the security tab.\n\n94\n00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,560\nNow this security tab, this is\nthe Discretionary Access Control list.\n\n95\n00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,140\nIt doesn't say DAC all across the top\nof it, that just says Security.\n\n96\n00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,630\nBut this is actually your\nDiscretionary Access Control list.\n\n97\n00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,670\nAnd then each one of these then is your,\nas you were saying, your ACE or\n\n98\n00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,500\naccess control entry.\n\n99\n00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,090\nNow I can use this list to\ncontrol who has access.\n\n100\n00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,970\nI can add people and\nI choose what permissions\n\n101\n00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,906\nthey are going to have over that resource.\n\n102\n00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:37,040\n>> Up at the top are the access\ncontrols entries, and\n\n103\n00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,609\nin the box below it,\nwhatever is selected above then\n\n104\n00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:46,890\nbelow are the permissions that\nare assigned to that entry.\n\n105\n00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,390\n>> Exactly.\n\n106\n00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,510\nSo, for example if I wanted\nto assign you permissions for\n\n107\n00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,730\nthis resource I'm gonna click\nedit on that security tab.\n\n108\n00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,890\nAnd then it brings up a writable\ncopy of the access control list, and\n\n109\n00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,970\nthen I will click add.\n\n110\n00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,030\nHey you notice my mouse is a little-\n>> Yeah.\n\n111\n00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,610\n>> Off of where.\n\n112\n00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,420\n>> Yeah, I was just looking at that.\n\n113\n00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,820\n>> It's kind of strange.\n\n114\n00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,300\nEvidently guys, my mouse, it doesn't\nlook like my mouse is where I'm actually\n\n115\n00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,650\nclicking there but\nI think you guys can figure it out.\n\n116\n00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,880\nSo, I'm gonna find your account.\n\n117\n00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,830\nI have made you an account on my laptop\nand I won't tell you the password so\n\n118\n00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,235\nthat you can't connect to my laptop.\n\n119\n00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:23,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I've got Nate here.\n\n120\n00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,515\nI'm gonna click Check Name so\nit'll find his account.\n\n121\n00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:26,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n122\n00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,370\n>> And I click OK.\n\n123\n00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,610\nAnd now I just added a new ACE for\nNate, an access control entry.\n\n124\n00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,780\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Now that there's an entry for Nate,\n\n125\n00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,080\nI can come down here, and I can control\nwhich permissions I want to give you.\n\n126\n00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,590\nSo if I want to give you full control,\nor if I want to just give you modify\n\n127\n00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,697\npermissions or probably to be safe I\nshould just give you read permissions.\n\n128\n00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:50,830\n[LAUGH].\n\n129\n00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,500\nBecause you guys know how Nate can be.\n\n130\n00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,760\n>> Yeah, well I'd use it for\nlike file storage.\n\n131\n00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,620\nI used to just dump a whole\nbunch of stuff in there.\n\n132\n00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,460\n>> All your MP3s, and all your movies, all\nof a sudden I'm out of hard drive space.\n\n133\n00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,030\nAnd I'm not sure why.\n\n134\n00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,940\n>> Well you could always\nput on disk quotas.\n\n135\n00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,200\nBut we'll get into that later.\n\n136\n00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,360\n>> Good segue.\n\n137\n00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,520\nSo yeah, there's your access control list.\n\n138\n00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,050\nIs again, the Security tab is\nthe discretionary access control list.\n\n139\n00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,310\nEach one of these lines is know as an ACE,\nor an Access Control Entry.\n\n140\n00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,007\nAnd then once you have an ACE it\ncan then control your permissions.\n\n141\n00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:31,021\nNow up there I see just above,\nit has Groups or User Names.\n\n142\n00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:36,686\nSo not only could you assign it to me,\nup there, if I was in a particular\n\n143\n00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:42,340\ngroup called awesome,\nthen you could select the awesome group.\n\n144\n00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,040\nAnd then assign that group permissions and\nthen who ever is in that group\n\n145\n00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,228\non here then will have\nthose same permissions.\n\n146\n00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:52,076\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n147\n00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:54,465\nLet's take a look at\nthat let's try that out.\n\n148\n00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:59,729\nBecause when we talk about\nbest practices we really want\n\n149\n00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:05,000\nto assign permissions to\ngroups not directly to users.\n\n150\n00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,250\nBecause I can put users in that group.\n\n151\n00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,169\nIf I have 50 sales people, and\n\n152\n00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,930\nI need to give 50 sales\npeople access to that folder.\n\n153\n00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,620\nThan I would much rather create a group,\nput those 50 people in the group and\n\n154\n00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,495\nthen assign the permission to the group.\n\n155\n00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:23,710\nCuz you get all the permissions that are\nassigned to the groups that you belong to.\n\n156\n00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,870\nAnd so then instead of 50 different\nentries in my access control list,\n\n157\n00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,740\nmaking that list really long,\nhaving to scroll through it.\n\n158\n00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,170\nI can just add that one group, and\nit makes it a lot easier to work with.\n\n159\n00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,000\nAnd then if I hire five new\nsales people on Monday,\n\n160\n00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,070\nall I have to do is add them to that\ngroup and they get those permissions.\n\n161\n00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,500\nAnd think about that in\ncorporate environment,\n\n162\n00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,435\nit's not gonna be just one folder,\nit's gonna be.\n\n163\n00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:47,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> 50 folders or 100 folders.\n\n164\n00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,360\nAnd so\nby just adding them to that one group,\n\n165\n00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,670\nI've assigned them permissions\nto 50 different resources.\n\n166\n00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,014\nSo I'm gonna make this a new group here.\n\n167\n00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:57,359\nAnd.\n\n168\n00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:03,320\nAwesomeness is that what\nyou wanted to go with.\n\n169\n00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,600\n>> Yeah\n>> And I'm going to add Mr.\n\n170\n00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,840\nNate to my awesomeness group.\n\n171\n00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,770\nAnd so now I've got a new group,\n\n172\n00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,900\nawesomeness\n>> And Nate is a member of that group.\n\n173\n00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,790\n>> Sweet.\n\n174\n00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,990\n>> So, if I go back over\nto my access control list,\n\n175\n00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,716\nat this point I could remove the ace for\nyour account directly.\n\n176\n00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:27,391\n>> Mn-hm\n>> And then add.\n\n177\n00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,185\nAwesomeness.\n\n178\n00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:33,329\n>> That's awesome right?\n\n179\n00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,560\n>> [LAUGH] No fun intended,\nthat was a fun intended I think.\n\n180\n00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,000\n>> That was good, that was good.\n\n181\n00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,890\n>> All right.\n\n182\n00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,760\nVery good, very good.\n\n183\n00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,380\nSo now I can see that in awesomeness.\n\n184\n00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,270\n>> Has relist folder contents read and\nwrite.\n\n185\n00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,020\nWhich will probably be a good time\nto talk about different permissions.\n\n186\n00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,210\n>> I was just gonna say that,\nI was gonna say hi Mike,\n\n187\n00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,300\nwhile we're right here let's go and\ntalk about the different permissions and\n\n188\n00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,770\nwhat exactly they allow for\nthe entires that are in there.\n\n189\n00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,695\n>> What they can do.\n\n190\n00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:06,910\n>> all right\n>> I'm gonna share all this stuff because\n\n191\n00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,740\none of the things we want to keep in\nmind is what permissions build on what.\n\n192\n00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,900\nBecause some permissions\nwhat you assign them,\n\n193\n00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,820\nit gives you additional\npermissions as well but.\n\n194\n00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,930\nSo we can start with read.\n\n195\n00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,580\n>> Yeah, read just allows.\n\n196\n00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,070\nThe person to be able to see the content\nlike, if it was read on a folder, then\n\n197\n00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,592\nit allows a person to see what is inside\nthat folder, just read what is in there.\n\n198\n00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now in a text file, then they would be\n\n199\n00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,580\nable to open up that text file\n>> Right.\n\n200\n00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,308\n>> and view View that tech file.\n\n201\n00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,182\n>> Yep.\n>> So read doesn't let you change\n\n202\n00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:48,189\nanything, or let you open that document\nup and view the contents of the document.\n\n203\n00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,251\nAnd so with a folder you're going to\nsee the folder in a directory, to get\n\n204\n00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:56,791\ninside the folder, we would need folder\ncontent to see what's inside of there.\n\n205\n00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,745\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> One thing I want to point out while we\n\n206\n00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:02,429\nhere, they'll notice read, when I give you\nread, it does not give you, oh I'm gonna\n\n207\n00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,516\ngive the group awesomeness read\nbecause you're a member of that group.\n\n208\n00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:06,156\n>> Yes.\n\n209\n00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,900\n>> Notice it doesn't\ngive you anything else.\n\n210\n00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,300\nI can check read, and nothing else.\n\n211\n00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,860\nAll right.\n\n212\n00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,310\nLet's do list folder content.\n\n213\n00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,860\nAnd list folder content is\npretty self explanatory, right?\n\n214\n00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,930\nIt tells you what it is in the name.\n\n215\n00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,100\n>> This allows me to list\nthe contents of a folder so\n\n216\n00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,400\nI can see all the documents inside there.\n\n217\n00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,250\nAgain, does not build on anything else.\n\n218\n00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,330\nAnd then read and execute, what's that?\n\n219\n00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,865\nTell us about that.\n\n220\n00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:38,390\n>> Right read and execute,\nyou have execute for starting up programs.\n\n221\n00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,810\nPrograms that, executable being\nable to launch those files.\n\n222\n00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,630\n>> Yeah,\nbeing able to run something basically.\n\n223\n00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,410\nSo if it's a .exe or a .cmd or .bat, or\n\n224\n00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,760\nsomething like that if you have read, but\nyou do not have read and execute, then\n\n225\n00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,200\nyou're not going to be able to actually\nexecute that script or that program.\n\n226\n00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,010\nAlso notice that, when I checked read and\nexecute you got nothing right now.\n\n227\n00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,190\nI check read and execute.\n\n228\n00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,080\nAnd it automatically gives you lists,\nfolder, contents, and read.\n\n229\n00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,595\nSo that read and execute Build on\ntop of those other permissions.\n\n230\n00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:16,785\nSo I can not give you read and\n\n231\n00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:20,535\nexecute without giving you read and\nlist folder contents.\n\n232\n00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:24,890\nIf I take away list folder contents,\nread and execute goes away.\n\n233\n00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,683\n>> Hm.\n>> So those build on each other.\n\n234\n00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:27,618\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n235\n00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:28,870\n>> All right.\n\n236\n00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,670\nSo we've got read, we've got list folder\ncontents, we've got read execute.\n\n237\n00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,570\nLet's try write.\n\n238\n00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,080\nThis is one that throws people for\na little bit of a loop, right.\n\n239\n00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,069\n>> Mm-hm.\nLet me see, so, right?\n\n240\n00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:43,090\nWrite allows editing.\n\n241\n00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,433\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n242\n00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:48,773\n>> Of a document,\n>> A folder If you have a folder,\n\n243\n00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:53,020\nyou can create new files inside that\nfolder if you have write permissions.\n\n244\n00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:59,520\nNow, one would think and this is where\nyou get thrown for a loop a little bit.\n\n245\n00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,270\nOne might think that if I give you right,\n\n246\n00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:07,720\nthat's also gonna give you read\npermissions and let's see what happens.\n\n247\n00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,510\n>> Yeah, nothing.\n\n248\n00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,467\n>> It does not does it.\n\n249\n00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:10,730\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So, and again,\n\n250\n00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,410\nthat's a little bit tricky, people are\nlike wait, how can you write permission.\n\n251\n00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,260\nIf you don't have read.\n\n252\n00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,450\nAnd again, first of all,\nwrite is gonna let you,\n\n253\n00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,210\nif you gotta folder, you can create\nnew documents inside the folder.\n\n254\n00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,990\nIf you got write permissions over a file,\nyou can open that file up.\n\n255\n00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,570\nAnd you can write inside that\ndocument in other words you could add\n\n256\n00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,330\na new paragraph to that employee handbook.\n\n257\n00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,200\nyou could delete the contents in that\ndocument, as far as like maybe take out\n\n258\n00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,650\na paragraph but you cannot do with\nwrite is delete the object itself.\n\n259\n00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,370\nso write permission so if I had write\nover a file I could open a file up.\n\n260\n00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,030\nAnd I could delete\neverything out of the file\n\n261\n00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,775\nI could just make it a blank document.\n\n262\n00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,990\n[LAUGH] But\nI could not delete the document itself.\n\n263\n00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,830\nIt would still be sitting there and it\nwould just be a blank document, all right?\n\n264\n00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n265\n00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,340\n>> Now, honestly I don't think in my 10,\n12 years of doing this I've ever given\n\n266\n00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,980\nsomebody write permission and\nnot read permission over a resource.\n\n267\n00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,611\nBut an example would be an online class.\n\n268\n00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:12,572\nLet's say you're attending\nsome university or something,\n\n269\n00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:14,060\nyou're doing an online class.\n\n270\n00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,190\nAnd you've got a homework assignment.\n\n271\n00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,020\nYou're supposed to write this essay, and\nthe instructor has given you an FTP URL\n\n272\n00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,320\nthat you can upload your\nhomework assignment to.\n\n273\n00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,410\nWell, you're going to need right\npermissions over that FTP directory, so\n\n274\n00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,270\nyou can upload your file.\n\n275\n00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,260\nBut I don't want you to be able to\nread everybody elses homework so\n\n276\n00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,560\nthat you can copy their stuff because I\nknow that's what you're trying to do.\n\n277\n00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,220\n>> You just want to look and\nmake sure that you did it right, right?\n\n278\n00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,110\nYou just want to compare it.\n\n279\n00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,670\n>> So that'd be a strange example or\nan interesting situation but that's one\n\n280\n00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,770\ntime where you might actually give\nsomebody write permission over a folder.\n\n281\n00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,580\nAnd not give them read\npermissions over that folder.\n\n282\n00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,347\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n283\n00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:57,692\nWrite does not build on anything else.\n\n284\n00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:02,570\nFor situation like,\nif you are to do some kind of like yeah,\n\n285\n00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,604\nautomatic some kind of collection.\n\n286\n00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,735\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Or something.\n\n287\n00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,520\nLike if you're collecting data.\n\n288\n00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,700\nThere is some kind that we just have\nright so we just grab everything and\n\n289\n00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,260\njust dump it into folders.\n\n290\n00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,450\nBut you also don't want other people to\nbe able to get into the folder as well.\n\n291\n00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,150\n>> You might have a service account that\nneeds write permission over a particular\n\n292\n00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,150\nlocation so it can dump log files to or\nsomething like that but\n\n293\n00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,050\nit doesn't necessarily\nneed read permission.\n\n294\n00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,110\nAnd we follow the principle\nof least privilege,\n\n295\n00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,130\nso I think what's the harm\nof giving it read.\n\n296\n00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,840\nWell, just principle of least privilege.\n\n297\n00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,020\nSo all right, so that's read, write,\nlist folder contents, read next key and\n\n298\n00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,120\nwe'll scroll up a little bit.\n\n299\n00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,600\nNext one we've got is modify.\n\n300\n00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,850\n>> Yep.\n>> Modify.\n\n301\n00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,860\n>> And modify, you know,\nlet's click on modify.\n\n302\n00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,580\n>> Check it.\n\n303\n00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,900\n>> Yep.\n>> Check, check it.\n\n304\n00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,930\n>> And, all right.\n\n305\n00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,420\nSo, it does everything else.\n\n306\n00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,455\nModify will let you do everything\nthat we've already talk about so far.\n\n307\n00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,432\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Including deleting the object,\n\n308\n00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:00,750\nas Mike puts it.\n\n309\n00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,550\n>> Exactly.\n\n310\n00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,000\n>> But the file, the folder,\nyou can delete it with modify.\n\n311\n00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,160\n>> Yeah, and it's exactly as Nate said.\n\n312\n00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,960\nModified gives you the ability to\nactually remove the object itself.\n\n313\n00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:17,390\nAs well as, as you notice,\nwhen I checked Modify, it gave me read,\n\n314\n00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,320\nlist folder contents, write,\nand read and execute.\n\n315\n00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,240\nAnd if I try to take away any any of these\npermissions, you no longer have Modify.\n\n316\n00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,210\nSo it builds on top of those other ones.\n\n317\n00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,520\nRight, take one of those away,\nit takes away Modify permissions.\n\n318\n00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,380\nAnd Modify is a pretty\npowerful permission, right?\n\n319\n00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,950\nAt that point if you can delete\nthe object itself that's a lot of power.\n\n320\n00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,945\nIt's very close to being full control and\nthat's our last permission.\n\n321\n00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:46,879\nNow let me go ahead and\nuncheck these guys.\n\n322\n00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,620\nWe can see what happens, all right.\n\n323\n00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,030\nSo, Full Control.\n\n324\n00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,810\n>> Yep, will do everything.\n\n325\n00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,440\n>> Everything.\n\n326\n00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,510\n>> Everything that we've talked about so\nfar.\n\n327\n00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:03,590\nAnd what makes full control\nmore fuller than the modify,\n\n328\n00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,990\nis full control allows\nthe person to change\n\n329\n00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,870\nthe permissions, right, for\nother people or whatnot.\n\n330\n00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,460\nModify permission, even though you can\ndelete the thing, I wouldn't be able to\n\n331\n00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:22,340\nadd my friend onto the access control\nlist with just Modify permissions.\n\n332\n00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,390\n>> Exactly.\n>> That's reserved for full control,\n\n333\n00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,620\nwhere you can change those permissions.\n\n334\n00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,670\n>> Yeah and so modify gives you just\nabout anything you can do, except for\n\n335\n00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,130\nmodifying that access control list itself.\n\n336\n00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,400\nAnd so it's kind of strange cuz we think\nfull control is this huge power, right?\n\n337\n00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,510\nAnd really you don't get that\nmuch more than modify when\n\n338\n00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,630\nyou're trying to list it out.\n\n339\n00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,510\nBut, as Nate said,\nfull control adds to modify.\n\n340\n00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,070\nIt gives you the ability to\nmodify the access control.\n\n341\n00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,648\nI shouldn't use the word modify,\nthat sounds redundant.\n\n342\n00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:57,210\nFull control lets you make changes\nto the access control list\n\n343\n00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,760\nas well as take ownership of a file.\n\n344\n00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,810\nThat's another permission that\nyou get with full control\n\n345\n00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,530\nis the ability to change\nthe owner of the file.\n\n346\n00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:10,060\nAnd file ownership is something I\ndon't know if we really talk about\n\n347\n00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,950\nit in any of our other segments, right?\n\n348\n00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,100\n>> Not yet, we haven't gotten into it yet.\n\n349\n00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,500\n>> Yeah the owner of the file,\nsometimes in a corporation,\n\n350\n00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,850\nlet's say Nate was tasked with\nbuilding up our employee handbook.\n\n351\n00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,738\nAnd so he makes this beautiful\nemployee handbook gets it all done\n\n352\n00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,260\nbut, what's that?\n\n353\n00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,301\n>> It's like a paragraph.\n\n354\n00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:30,154\n>> Do whatever you want.\n\n355\n00:18:30,154 --> 00:18:31,570\nThat's what Nate's plan is.\n\n356\n00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,350\nMake sure you have the Steam\nengine installed on all machines.\n\n357\n00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,089\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n358\n00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,190\nNo high scores.\n>> Since Nate was the one\n\n359\n00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,930\nthat created that document.\n\n360\n00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,450\nHe now has full control.\n\n361\n00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,910\nAnd that might, well who cares, right?\n\n362\n00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,290\nWell if Nate gets upset with a coworker,\nand\n\n363\n00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,970\ndecides to take away his access\nto that employee handbook?\n\n364\n00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,430\nWhat if Nate leaves\nthe company some point?\n\n365\n00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:59,240\nSo we will typically, documents like that,\nthat are important to the entire company,\n\n366\n00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,550\nwe want to change the owner over to\nthe administrator group usually or\n\n367\n00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,990\nsomething like that.\n\n368\n00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,435\nSo, but only if you have full control\ncan you change that ownership.\n\n369\n00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n370\n00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,280\nYeah.\n\n371\n00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,570\nNow, should we talk about the deny\nthat's on there too, is now a good time?\n\n372\n00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,500\n>> Well let's, yeah we'll come to\nthat when we start getting into.\n\n373\n00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,400\nWell we can go ahead and\nmention it I suppose.\n\n374\n00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,470\nYeah when we talk about denys,\nI've been doing the allows.\n\n375\n00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,039\nWe need to go over a concept known\nas implicit deny, all right?\n\n376\n00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,830\nImplicit deny and\n\n377\n00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,590\nthat makes the deny thing a whole,\nmakes a little more sense right.\n\n378\n00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,250\n>> So\nimplicit like if you implicitly assign\n\n379\n00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,820\nsomeone to something\nthen you're giving them.\n\n380\n00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,000\nThey're on the list.\n\n381\n00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,430\n>> If you explicitly assigned, yeah.\n\n382\n00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then if it's explicitly\n\n383\n00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,990\nthen if you're not on the list\nthen you don't get in.\n\n384\n00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,040\nOther way.\n>> Other way around?\n\n385\n00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,510\n>> I think, wait.\n\n386\n00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,801\nI don't know if I follow the way you\nsaid that but I agree with you I think.\n\n387\n00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n388\n00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,100\nWindows operates on\nan implicit deny system.\n\n389\n00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,170\nIn other words,\nif you're not in this list,\n\n390\n00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,400\nif you're not in this access control list,\neven though I haven't added you and\n\n391\n00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,818\nchecked deny,\nyou don't have access to the resource.\n\n392\n00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,440\nWhen you double-click on a resource,\nit has to see you or\n\n393\n00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,520\na group you belong to in that list and\ndetermine what permissions you have.\n\n394\n00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,100\nAnd if you're not in there,\nyou don't have access.\n\n395\n00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,460\nSo that's an implicit deny.\n\n396\n00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,950\nSo I don't have to think about\neverybody that I don't want\n\n397\n00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,700\nto have access to this resource,\nand then add them and deny them.\n\n398\n00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,860\nI can just make sure they're not in the\nlist and then they won't get access to it.\n\n399\n00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,690\nAn explicit deny is when\nI add you to this list.\n\n400\n00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,320\nAnd I check the Deny column.\n\n401\n00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,630\nNow, that's an explicit deny.\n\n402\n00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,900\nEither way,\nyou don't get access to the resource.\n\n403\n00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,060\nThe difference is gonna be\nthat with the implicit deny,\n\n404\n00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,250\nyou might get added to some group,\n\n405\n00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:07,290\nsome time in the future that has access\nto the resource and you'll get access.\n\n406\n00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,420\nIf I explicitly deny you,\n\n407\n00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,490\nthen it doesn't matter what groups you get\nadded to in the future because that deny\n\n408\n00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,860\nwill override any allows that you\nmight pick up from other things.\n\n409\n00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,270\nSo, yeah we use implicit in ours,\nwe just don't add you to the list.\n\n410\n00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,920\nIf Nate's a troublemaker and\n\n411\n00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,030\nI want to make sure he never\ngets access to the resource.\n\n412\n00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,575\nThen I'm gonna add him to the list and I'm\ngonna deny him access to that resource.\n\n413\n00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:32,390\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n414\n00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,035\n>> You wanna use deny sparingly, right?\n\n415\n00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:35,800\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, sparingly.\n\n416\n00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,560\nBut yeah, like what you're saying.\n\n417\n00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,910\nIf you get added to a group,\npermissions are cumulative, right?\n\n418\n00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,360\nI don't know if now is the right time\nto get into groups and all that stuff.\n\n419\n00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,370\nBut if a person is a member of more\nthan one group, then their permissions\n\n420\n00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,580\nover that document are the permissions\nof this group plus the permissions\n\n421\n00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,960\nof this group kind of added together,\nand that's their whole thing.\n\n422\n00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,660\nRight?\n\n423\n00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,085\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n424\n00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:08,240\nNTFS permissions are cumulative.\n\n425\n00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,450\nSo if you were to belong to Awesomeness.\n\n426\n00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,110\nAnd I gave Awesomeness read permission.\n\n427\n00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,200\nAnd let's say you were also\nadded to a group called,\n\n428\n00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,100\nin fact let's not talk about it,\nlet's do it.\n\n429\n00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,940\nLet's do it, so I'm going to go ahead and\nget out of this list here.\n\n430\n00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,850\n>> Spur of the moment,\n\n431\n00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,744\nI wasn't expecting this\n>> Surprise, surprise, and\n\n432\n00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:30,960\nI'm going to go back into\nmy computer management.\n\n433\n00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,340\nActually I think I still\nhad it open down there.\n\n434\n00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,830\nAnd we'll make another group,\nand we'll call this Great, oops.\n\n435\n00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,620\n>> Greatness?\n\n436\n00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,280\n>> Greatness.\n\n437\n00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,936\n>> Oh, nice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n438\n00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:45,330\nAwesomeness and Greatness and\nlet's add Nate to Greatness.\n\n439\n00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:45,830\n>> Nice.\n\n440\n00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,080\n>> Cuz this'll actually lead right\ninto our effective permissions.\n\n441\n00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,840\n>> Oh ho ho ho.\n\n442\n00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,420\n>> How about that?\n\n443\n00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,410\nWe got to talk about\neffective permissions here.\n\n444\n00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,230\n>> Man, you planned this, didn't you?\n\n445\n00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,939\n>> Yeah, so we'll create another\ngroup called Greatness, and\n\n446\n00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:03,350\nI just want to double check that my\nadding him to that group succeed.\n\n447\n00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,271\nSo Nate is now in both Awesomeness And\nGreatness.\n\n448\n00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:07,970\n>> Nice.\n\n449\n00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,380\n>> And so then we're gonna\nback over to this folder and\n\n450\n00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,550\ntake a look at our access control list.\n\n451\n00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,700\nAnd I'm gonna edit my access control list.\n\n452\n00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,480\nAnd I'm going to add first Greatness.\n\n453\n00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:32,060\nAnd I'm going to give greatness the\ndefault read list and read and execute.\n\n454\n00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,970\nYou notice when I added that\ngroup it automatically has read,\n\n455\n00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,020\nlist folders contents, read and execute?\n\n456\n00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,420\nThat's our default permission.\n\n457\n00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,241\nThen I'm going to add Awesomeness.\n\n458\n00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:47,210\n>> Isn't Awesomeness already in there?\n\n459\n00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,210\n>> No,\ncuz I took away all your permissions.\n\n460\n00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,280\nSo if there's an entry in the access\ncontrol list that doesn't have any\n\n461\n00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,335\npermissions, it just\ndrops it out of the list.\n\n462\n00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:54,875\n>> Oh, right?\n\n463\n00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,125\n>> So, yeah, there's no point\nin showing it in the list.\n\n464\n00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,085\nSo I add Awesomeness.\n\n465\n00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:01,832\nAnd I'm gonna give\nawesomeness not my default,\n\n466\n00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:04,850\nI'm gonna give awesomeness\njust write permission.\n\n467\n00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,010\nAnd so now.\n\n468\n00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,170\n>> So, wait,\ndid the greatness also have write?\n\n469\n00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,205\n>> Nope, greatness only has read,\nlist, and read.\n\n470\n00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:15,785\n>> Okay.\n\n471\n00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:18,560\n>> And then awesomeness has write,\nbut no read.\n\n472\n00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:27,210\nSo, as Nate was saying, we talk about\nNTFS permissions, they're cumulative.\n\n473\n00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,340\nYou get to add up all the permissions\nfrom all the groups that you belong to.\n\n474\n00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,990\nNow, if we're following our\nbest practices we use groups.\n\n475\n00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,690\nWe don't assign individual users.\n\n476\n00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,360\nBecause again,\n\n477\n00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,280\nI have dozens of sales people and I don't\nwant to add each one one at a time.\n\n478\n00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,580\nSo I make a group called sales and\nI put all those people in there.\n\n479\n00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,730\nOr a group called awesomeness and\nI dump all my awesome people in there and\n\n480\n00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,960\nI created another group called greatness\nand I dump all my great people in there.\n\n481\n00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,390\nI don't know how you made it\ninto both of those groups.\n\n482\n00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,390\n>> Yeah, I don't know.\n\n483\n00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,720\n>> Awesome and great?\n\n484\n00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,730\n>> I guess to save you the time you could\njust make everybody administrators, right?\n\n485\n00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,355\nAnd then you don't have to worry\nabout any kind of permissions.\n\n486\n00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:05,580\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely, yeah, that's a.\n\n487\n00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,750\n>> They just kind of do whatever.\n\n488\n00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,810\n>> I have seen some\nnetworks set up like that.\n\n489\n00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,770\nScary scary stuff.\n\n490\n00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,080\nI have seen a network where\nevery user on the network\n\n491\n00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,770\nwas added to the domain admins room.\n\n492\n00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,150\nThe administrator found it easier.\n\n493\n00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,670\nAnd he's like,\n\n494\n00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,380\nI don't have to worry about anything\nif everybody can do anything they want.\n\n495\n00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,380\n>> Nice.\n>> Including remove the domain, I mean.\n\n496\n00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, was not a very smart idea.\n\n497\n00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,170\nSo yeah.\n\n498\n00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not bright at all.\n\n499\n00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,380\nThat's not a good thing to do.\n\n500\n00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,490\nSo, you were saying something about the\npermissions being accumulative like that.\n\n501\n00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,300\nSo, as an admin,\nwhen we're troubleshooting permissions and\n\n502\n00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,980\nthings like that, I really need to know,\nwhat permissions does Nate have?\n\n503\n00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,200\nNate's telling me he cannot change,\nhe's trying to delete the file and\n\n504\n00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,970\nhe can't change it.\n\n505\n00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,870\nHe can't delete it.\n\n506\n00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:59,185\nSo I look at the access control list, and\nI don't see Nate anywhere in that list.\n\n507\n00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:01,600\nNate's not in my list, so\n\n508\n00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,470\nit almost looks like Nate doesn't have\nany permissions over this resource.\n\n509\n00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,640\nBut if we go down here and\n\n510\n00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,700\nclick on our advanced button on the Access\ncontrol that's on that security tab.\n\n511\n00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,140\nWe get this tab called effective access,\neffective access.\n\n512\n00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,880\nAnd what I can do, is I can select a user,\nand I will find Nate,\n\n513\n00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,880\nand then I can click\nview effective access.\n\n514\n00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,310\nAnd I'll see that Nate actually\nhas all these permissions.\n\n515\n00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:41,992\nAnd notice he has read and\nwrite even though one group only has read,\n\n516\n00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:45,854\none group only has write,\nNate belongs to both groups so\n\n517\n00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,670\nhe gets to add up all those permissions.\n\n518\n00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,390\n>> Nice.\n\n519\n00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:53,668\nSo up there,\nthose are the effective permissions for\n\n520\n00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:56,910\nthat one folder that we're looking at.\n\n521\n00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,743\nSo the name up there\nusers/mike/desktop/test those\n\n522\n00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:07,745\nare the effective permissions for\nNate on just this one test folder.\n\n523\n00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:10,581\n>> Well, it's great,\nbecause what it's going to do,\n\n524\n00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:13,302\nit's gonna look at all\nthe groups Nate belongs to.\n\n525\n00:27:13,302 --> 00:27:15,050\nIt's gonna look at what\nkind of permissions\n\n526\n00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,430\nthose groups have been assigned.\n\n527\n00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:21,190\nIt's going denies that might be\nadded to any groups you belong to.\n\n528\n00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,290\nIt's going to add them all up for\nme and show me what it is in the end.\n\n529\n00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,530\nIt makes it very nice, because as I said,\nif we look at the access control list\n\n530\n00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:35,050\nitself, I cannot tell that Nate has\nany permissions over this resource.\n\n531\n00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,110\nI come in here and I realize, oh smack.\n\n532\n00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,556\nHe has read and\nwrite permissions over that resource.\n\n533\n00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:41,386\nGotta take that away.\n\n534\n00:27:41,386 --> 00:27:45,035\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n535\n00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:48,960\nthat's a good look at\nour NTFS permissions.\n\n536\n00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,230\nWe've talked about the different\npermissions that we can assign, read,\n\n537\n00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:59,010\nlist folder contents, read and\nexecute, write, modify, full control.\n\n538\n00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,340\nWe didn't mention, well we're gonna create\na file here in our next segment and\n\n539\n00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,460\nwe'll take a look.\n\n540\n00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,470\nList folder contents is\nonly available in folders.\n\n541\n00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,410\nOn a file.\n\n542\n00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,960\nIf you pull up that access control\nlist you're not going to see\n\n543\n00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,975\nthe list folder content.\n\n544\n00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:14,400\nCuz it's not a folder.\n\n545\n00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,540\nThat makes sense right?\n\n546\n00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,970\n>> Yeah that makes sense.\n\n547\n00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,480\nWe took it out of there.\n\n548\n00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,500\n>> And we took a look at what's\nknown as the effective permissions.\n\n549\n00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,010\nImportant concept.\n\n550\n00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,480\nNTSF permissions are cumulative.\n\n551\n00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,220\nAll the groups you belong to, we've got\nto add up all those permissions and\n\n552\n00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,300\nthat's what you get in the end.\n\n553\n00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,940\nAnd that effective permissions\ntab makes it easy.\n\n554\n00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,210\nBecause now I could, if I didn't want\nto use that Effective Permissions tab.\n\n555\n00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,790\nWe could start drilling\ndown onto these groups.\n\n556\n00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,190\nI could go into active directory or\nmy local users and computers.\n\n557\n00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,850\nAnd I could find out well,\nwho's in the greatness group?\n\n558\n00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,260\nWho's in that group?\n\n559\n00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,770\nSo I could go look that up manually.\n\n560\n00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,600\nAnd I could go through each group and\nsee which groups you're in.\n\n561\n00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,890\n>> Manually, what does that mean?\n\n562\n00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n563\n00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,140\nWork smarter not harder right?\n\n564\n00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,140\nThat's why that effective\npermissions tab is so nice.\n\n565\n00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,468\nBecause I can come over here,\nI can dump any user in there, and\n\n566\n00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:11,140\nI can immediately see what NTFS\npermissions are assigned to that.\n\n567\n00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,317\nAnd of course,\nyou know on our last episode,\n\n568\n00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:23,730\nDon and I, we touched into shared\nfolders and shared access.\n\n569\n00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:29,550\nNTFS, those permissions are for\nlocal access on the machine.\n\n570\n00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,350\nShared folders and shared access,\nthat's a different set of permissions for\n\n571\n00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,530\naccessing that file over the network.\n\n572\n00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,290\n>> Exactly.\n\n573\n00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:44,970\nAll right, well pretty much,\nwe're just about out of time here for\n\n574\n00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,690\nour first segment.\n\n575\n00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,510\nSo why don't we take a little break,\n\n576\n00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,530\nrefresh the drinks, and\nstretch the legs out a little bit?\n\n577\n00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,404\n>> Yep.\n>> When we come back we're gonna jump into\n\n578\n00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:55,280\nmore permissions, right?\n\n579\n00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,550\nAll right, we'll come back and\n\n580\n00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,990\nwe're gonna take a look at some\nconcepts like inheritance.\n\n581\n00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,690\n>> Oh, that's right.\n\n582\n00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,410\n>> Blocking permissions,\nand things like that.\n\n583\n00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,720\nSo more exciting stuff coming up,\ndon't go away.\n\n584\n00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,640\nWe'll be right back.\n\n585\n00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:16,597\n[MUSIC]\n\n586\n00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:20,177\n>> All right and\nwelcome back, welcome back.\n\n587\n00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:24,719\nPicking up where we left off with\nNTFS permissions, progressing on\n\n588\n00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:29,890\ndown the line of stuff that we are doing\nwith NTFS, that sort of thing.\n\n589\n00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,580\nSo we just wrapped up with\neffective permissions,\n\n590\n00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:38,710\nand now we're going to get into,\nwhat again?\n\n591\n00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,470\n>> Let's take a look at\npermission inheritance.\n\n592\n00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,590\n>> Permission inheritance.\n\n593\n00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,710\n>> Permission inheritance,\nfantastic feature.\n\n594\n00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,690\nYeah when we talk about,\nwe were talking earlier about how\n\n595\n00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,770\nI want to use groups to assign\npermissions to make it easier on our end.\n\n596\n00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,440\nSo I don't have to assign\nthose permissions 1800 times I\n\n597\n00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,490\ncan put everybody in a group.\n\n598\n00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,770\nAnd assign the permissions to the group so\nit makes our life easier.\n\n599\n00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,680\nAnother great thing about NTFS\npermissions is that they inherit down.\n\n600\n00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,871\nAnd what that means is when I\nassign permissions to a folder,\n\n601\n00:31:06,871 --> 00:31:11,309\nif there are folders, subfolders,\nfiles inside that folder,\n\n602\n00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:15,767\nthose permissions are gonna\ninherit down to all those objects.\n\n603\n00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:19,520\nI don't have to go to each one of them,\npull up that access control list.\n\n604\n00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,570\n>> Yeah, so, in that case, yeah.\n\n605\n00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,470\nYou could set permissions in on a folder,\nright?\n\n606\n00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,780\nAnd then,\nthe things that you copy into that folder\n\n607\n00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,930\nwill get the same permissions\nas the parent, as Mike calls it.\n\n608\n00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,772\nAs the folder that they're going into.\n\n609\n00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:43,640\n[LAUGH] It's going,\njust kind of like, up the list.\n\n610\n00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,170\n>> Exactly.\n\n611\n00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,272\nSo you've got, you know, 50 documents\nthat the sales people need access to and\n\n612\n00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,420\nyou want to give them all read permission.\n\n613\n00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,922\nWell, we took all those sales people and\n\n614\n00:31:52,922 --> 00:31:55,800\nput them into a group to\nmake that part easier.\n\n615\n00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,050\nThen we can take all those 50\ndocuments and put them in a folder.\n\n616\n00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,190\nAnd I can assign the permissions\nto the group over the folder.\n\n617\n00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,390\nAnd let those permissions inherit\ndown to all the objects inside there.\n\n618\n00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,620\nAnd I didn't have to open up 50 different\naccess control lists and one at a time.\n\n619\n00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,030\nThe time to go in there and\nmake those changes.\n\n620\n00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,800\nSo let's do a little demo.\n\n621\n00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,470\n>> Yeah.\nI like these.\n\n622\n00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,500\nThey're fun.\n\n623\n00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,560\n>> We'll flip back over to my screen here.\n\n624\n00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,350\nAnd, I'm gonna pull up, again I've\ngot that folder called test, and\n\n625\n00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,090\njust to verify,\nwe'll take a look at Properties.\n\n626\n00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,150\nWe'll right-click Properties.\n\n627\n00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,740\nAnd then I'm going to.\n\n628\n00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,030\nGo over to my security tab,\nmy access control list and\n\n629\n00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,450\nwe can see the awesomeness\nhas right permission and\n\n630\n00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,970\ngreatness has read and execute permission.\n\n631\n00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,610\nSo i'll click okay for those, verify that.\n\n632\n00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,100\nThen i'm going to go inside this folder\nand i'm going to make a new, File.\n\n633\n00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,430\nYou got a name for your new file here?\n\n634\n00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,968\n>> Lets call these game codes.\n\n635\n00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:50,936\n>> Game codes.\n\n636\n00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:51,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n637\n00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:57,750\nIf there's one thing that we would\nwanna store on a company network.\n\n638\n00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,630\n>> Absolutely.\n>> It'd be game codes.\n\n639\n00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,790\n>> Gotta make sure everybody has access.\n\n640\n00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,520\nFor those game codes.\n\n641\n00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,560\nSo there I just created a file\nagain inside this folder.\n\n642\n00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,030\nI'm going to make this\na little bit smaller so\n\n643\n00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,220\nwe can kind of see what's going on here.\n\n644\n00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,954\nI'll just move this folder this way.\n\n645\n00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,214\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n646\n00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:12,445\n>> It is strange isn't it.\n\n647\n00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:13,770\n>> Yeah.\n>> It doesn't look like I'm clicking on\n\n648\n00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,400\nanything.\n\n649\n00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,870\nI'm just moving this window\nby clicking out in space.\n\n650\n00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,480\nSo I apologize to our viewers our there.\n\n651\n00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,230\nI don't know why it's.\n\n652\n00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,800\n>> What if you use your finger?\n\n653\n00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,680\n>> Let's see here.\n\n654\n00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,940\nI don't think you can see\nwhere I'm touching though.\n\n655\n00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,430\n>> Yeah there's no mouse.\n\n656\n00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,140\n>> It's just off for some reason.\n\n657\n00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,240\nWe'll work on that.\n\n658\n00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,010\nSo here I've got this\nfile inside this folder.\n\n659\n00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,270\nNow I haven't done anything to it yet.\n\n660\n00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,150\nWe haven't assigned any permissions,\nhaven't opened up the permissions yet.\n\n661\n00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,045\nSo I'm going to right click Properties.\n\n662\n00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:44,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n663\n00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:48,435\n>> And I'm gonna go over to that\nsecurity tab, and son of a gun.\n\n664\n00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:49,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n665\n00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,710\n>> There's awesomeness and\nthere's greatness.\n\n666\n00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,000\n>> Oh, it's like it inherited\nthe permissions, that's crazy.\n\n667\n00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,205\n>> It's magic, right?\n\n668\n00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:58,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n669\n00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,940\n>> So it did indeed.\n\n670\n00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,040\nWhen I put that file inside that folder\nit inherited any permissions that were\n\n671\n00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,150\nassigned to the folder have come\nto this object inside there.\n\n672\n00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,820\nAnd that goes all the way up.\n\n673\n00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,710\nRight?\nC colon is going to be the top parent, so\n\n674\n00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,860\nI can assign a permission\nat C colon itself.\n\n675\n00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,728\nLike if I went into Windows Explorer And\nI pull up the properties for\n\n676\n00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:26,850\nC:, it has an access control list like\nany other object on an NTFS partition,\n\n677\n00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,770\nand if I assign permissions here,\n\n678\n00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,870\nthat would inherit down to every\nsingle object on that C: drive.\n\n679\n00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,910\n>> Doesn't look like\nthere's anything in there.\n\n680\n00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:38,140\n>> Authenticated users do, they have a\n>> Special permissions down\n\n681\n00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,370\nhere which I don't, probably that's\ngonna be another segment I would think\n\n682\n00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,260\nis special permissions\n>> Or maybe today.\n\n683\n00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,960\n>> We'll see.\n\n684\n00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,040\nIf we have time,\nwe'll get into special permissions.\n\n685\n00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,740\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, now do be careful,\n\n686\n00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,670\nI have made changes to this before\n>> One, it can take a long time.\n\n687\n00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,280\nIf you make a change here, it's gotta\npropagate to every object on that drive.\n\n688\n00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,852\nAnd if it's a large drive it can take\nsome time to go through that process.\n\n689\n00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:05,710\nCause C: has all your Windows files,\nyour program files.\n\n690\n00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,840\nYour Windows directory,\na lot of objects in there, so\n\n691\n00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,030\njust something to keep in mind.\n\n692\n00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,220\nAll right, so\nback out to our little file here.\n\n693\n00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,760\nNow, what I'm gonna do.\n\n694\n00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,170\nIs, we saw that those inherited\ndown from that parent object.\n\n695\n00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,700\nNow I'm gonna pull up the properties for\nthe folder.\n\n696\n00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,180\nAnd we're gonna compare these\nguys side by side, all right?\n\n697\n00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,120\nSo here I've got, on the left I've\ngot the properties for the folder.\n\n698\n00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,050\nOver on the right I've got the properties\nfor the file that's inside the folder.\n\n699\n00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:40,530\nGonna take a look at last year's\ngreatness for our example here.\n\n700\n00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,860\nFirst thing you'll notice is a file\ndoes not have list folder contents.\n\n701\n00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,160\n>> Oh yeah, just like you said earlier.\n\n702\n00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,720\n>> Yeah, because it's a file,\nit's not a folder,\n\n703\n00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,680\nso it doesn't have those folder contents.\n\n704\n00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,160\nKind of makes sense when you think about\nit the other thing that you notice though\n\n705\n00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,660\nis aside from that one check mark missing\n\n706\n00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,420\nyou notice anything else that's\ndifferent between those permissions?\n\n707\n00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,160\n>> I do Mike.\n\n708\n00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,710\n>> What do you see there?\n\n709\n00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,380\n>> I see that the check marks.\n\n710\n00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,390\nAre different colors.\n\n711\n00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,430\n>> They are, aren't they?\n\n712\n00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,510\n>> One is black and one is grey,\nand it means something right?\n\n713\n00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,880\n>> You tell me, I don't know.\n\n714\n00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:20,710\n>> The black checks are ones\nthat we can change,\n\n715\n00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,660\nthe grey checks are ones\nwe cannot change and we.\n\n716\n00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,070\nCannot change those.\n\n717\n00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:31,170\nBecause those are being inherited\nfrom it's parent folder.\n\n718\n00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,920\nThe one that it's sitting inside of.\n\n719\n00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,170\n>> Exactly right so.\n\n720\n00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,300\nQuick easy way you can\nlook at these permissions.\n\n721\n00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,440\nAnd I can see the ones on\nthe left in that folder.\n\n722\n00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,500\nThose are what we call\nexplicit permissions.\n\n723\n00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,560\nSomebody has gone to that folder.\n\n724\n00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,680\nOpen up that access control list and\n\n725\n00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,580\ndirectly assign the permissions\ntp that object, so\n\n726\n00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,450\nthey show up as black, indicating\nthat they are explicitly assigned.\n\n727\n00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,950\nAnd as they pointed out,\nI can make changes, right?\n\n728\n00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,900\nI could come over here and click edit, and\nI could undo some of these check marks\n\n729\n00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,590\nhere if I wanted to take some\nof those permissions away.\n\n730\n00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,510\nOn the file, these permissions as they.\n\n731\n00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,570\nFold down or inherit it from that parent\nobject, that top level folder, and\n\n732\n00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,580\nthey're gray.\n\n733\n00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,510\nAnd I can't change them.\n\n734\n00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,770\nLike, if I click Edit, and\n\n735\n00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:17,810\nI go Select Gradeness down here, I can't\nchange those inherited permissions.\n\n736\n00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,180\nI can assign other permissions, but\n\n737\n00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,690\nI cannot make changes to those inherited\npermissions directly like that.\n\n738\n00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,260\nSo that's the big difference\nbetween explicit permissions and\n\n739\n00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,530\ninherited permissions.\n\n740\n00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,880\nTheres actually three ways we can end up\nmaking changes to inherited permissions.\n\n741\n00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,920\nI can go to the parent object.\n\n742\n00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,570\nAnd I can make a change there and\n\n743\n00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,120\nthen that change would inherit\ndown to the child object.\n\n744\n00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,640\nSo if I didn't want you to have read and\nexecute for example,\n\n745\n00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,760\nI could come out here and\nedit the parent object.\n\n746\n00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,080\nAnd take away read and execute.\n\n747\n00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,320\nAll right, then we pull up\nthe properties of that file again.\n\n748\n00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,798\nAnd take a look at greatness.\n\n749\n00:38:04,798 --> 00:38:07,750\nAnd they no longer have read and execute.\n\n750\n00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:12,640\nSo I was able to change that\ninherited permission by modifying\n\n751\n00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,974\nthe parent object,\nwhere the permissions were coming from.\n\n752\n00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:21,830\n>> The greatness, he's on that list,\nor the group is on that list,\n\n753\n00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,940\nbecause it's inherited from.\n\n754\n00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,868\nThe folder that it's sitting in.\n\n755\n00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:29,990\nSo can we delete that guy?\n\n756\n00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:34,290\nCan we delete that group out\nof the list from the folder?\n\n757\n00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,600\n>> We could.\nWe could remove the permissions up on the\n\n758\n00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,150\nparent object and then you would no longer\nhave permissions over that child object.\n\n759\n00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:40,700\nExactly.\n\n760\n00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,490\n>> Could you take them\nout of the game codes?\n\n761\n00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,100\n>> Here?\n\n762\n00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,620\nNo, I cannot because you are inheriting\nthose permissions from the parent object.\n\n763\n00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,630\nI can't remove Greatness because this\nobject is inheriting permissions.\n\n764\n00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,118\nFrom its parent object\n>> See I didn't make up that parent term\n\n765\n00:38:57,118 --> 00:39:01,910\nright [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah yeah so this is the area I\n\n766\n00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,660\nwas hoping that to get so\nright there right so we try to remove.\n\n767\n00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,826\nSomething that was being inherited and so\nWindows gave it a little prompt that says\n\n768\n00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:17,760\nblah blah blah blah, we can not because\nthis is being inherited from above.\n\n769\n00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,360\nSo that's what that means.\n\n770\n00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:25,290\nIt's being inherited, so you'd have to\ngo up a level and make changes there.\n\n771\n00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:29,140\n>> And you have to go all the way back up\nwherever they were explicitly assigned.\n\n772\n00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,270\nIf there was a folder inside a folder,\ninside a folder and\n\n773\n00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,000\nyou wanted to change permissions\non that sub, sub, sub folder.\n\n774\n00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,905\nRight, you'd have to go all the way back\nup to where they were explicitly assigned.\n\n775\n00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:43,115\nBecause the parent above that,\nit's inheriting from the folder above that\n\n776\n00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,605\nwhich is inheriting from\nthe folder above that.\n\n777\n00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:47,545\nSo, you gotta find where\nthey're explicitly assigned.\n\n778\n00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:49,569\nNow, let me set this back real quick so\n\n779\n00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:53,125\nwe still have those same permissions and\nwe'll take another way.\n\n780\n00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:57,964\nSo, the first way that I can change\ninherited permissions Is to modify\n\n781\n00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:02,320\nthe parent object or\nwherever they were explicitly assigned.\n\n782\n00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,180\nThat's one way I can change\nthose inherited permissions.\n\n783\n00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,750\nAnother way that I could change\nthe inherited permissions,\n\n784\n00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,100\nwould be to assign\nthe opposite permissions.\n\n785\n00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,830\nI can't change these permissions,\nthese inherited permissions, but\n\n786\n00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,730\nwhat I could do is come in here and\nsay, Edit, find Mr.\n\n787\n00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,035\nGreatness, and deny the read and\nexecute and read.\n\n788\n00:40:27,035 --> 00:40:28,165\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n789\n00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:33,075\n>> So even though your inheriting the\nbreed and execute from the parent object,\n\n790\n00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:36,885\nnow I've explicitly assigned\nthe deny permission,\n\n791\n00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:40,730\nthe opposite permission, and\nit's gonna warn me that denies are bad.\n\n792\n00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,730\nYou really gotta to be careful with them,\nand you do.\n\n793\n00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:50,660\nAnd so now, that explicit deny\nwill override the inherit allow.\n\n794\n00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,310\nAnd so denies, typically for\n\n795\n00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,202\nthe most part,\nalways override the allow provisions.\n\n796\n00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:55,910\n>> Mm-hm.\nRight,\n\n797\n00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,070\nso that's the second way, we can change\nthe permissions of the parent object.\n\n798\n00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:04,030\nWe can assign the opposite\npermission at the child object, or\n\n799\n00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,980\nthe one that we're trying to change.\n\n800\n00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,950\nAnd I'm gonna undo that so\nwe can get back to our original example.\n\n801\n00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:18,140\nThere is one more way, that I could\nchange your inherited permissions.\n\n802\n00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,920\nAnd you were hitting towards that\na minute ago with that error,\n\n803\n00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,010\nwhat's the third way I could do it?\n\n804\n00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,210\n>> Right, so\nit's in the advanced section, right.\n\n805\n00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:33,624\nWe can go in there and it's a setting\nthat is called disable inheritance.\n\n806\n00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n807\n00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,915\n>> And what's that gonna do is\nbreak the ties that this files or\n\n808\n00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:41,404\nthis child object as Mike puts it.\n\n809\n00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:42,147\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n810\n00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:42,745\n>> Big words.\n\n811\n00:41:42,745 --> 00:41:46,613\n[CROSSTALK] Well Mike.\n\n812\n00:41:46,613 --> 00:41:47,354\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n813\n00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:55,958\n>> Yes, so it's going to break those\nties that it has up the chain.\n\n814\n00:41:55,958 --> 00:42:00,080\nNow, I suppose if you have a folder for\n\n815\n00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,330\nsomething that,\nmaybe you have a Marketing department.\n\n816\n00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,700\nAnd I guess for\nsome reason you don't want to\n\n817\n00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,690\nchange stuff further up the line to make\nmarketing not be able to access something.\n\n818\n00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,100\nThen you could break inheritance on one.\n\n819\n00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,055\nObject or one folder.\n\n820\n00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:19,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n821\n00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:24,090\nAnd do whatever you need to make changes\ninstead of having to go clear up\n\n822\n00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,280\nthe chain, and make it there because\nthen it would do everything.\n\n823\n00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n824\n00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,270\nFor an example,\nlet's do something like this.\n\n825\n00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:37,107\nLet's say, we've got another file in here,\n\n826\n00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:43,550\nthat's gonna be called Product keys,\nall right.\n\n827\n00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,956\nAnd let's go back over\nto this parent object.\n\n828\n00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:50,513\nAnd let's give greatness.\n\n829\n00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:54,770\nYeah, it's being a little slow here.\n\n830\n00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,460\nThere it goes.\n\n831\n00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,670\nLet's give Greatness his\nwrite permissions as well.\n\n832\n00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,340\n>> And SSD and\nit can't pull that up fast enough.\n\n833\n00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:04,990\n>> I know, right.\n\n834\n00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,657\nIt's all this stuff I've got going\non with the IVGA and all that.\n\n835\n00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:10,397\nI'm sure that's what it is, all right.\n\n836\n00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:12,230\n>> [LAUGH].\nSo now we can see that greatness has\n\n837\n00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,490\nbeen explicitly assigned write\npermissions over this test folder.\n\n838\n00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,680\nIf we go down to those files.\n\n839\n00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,380\nEither one of them.\n\n840\n00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:26,130\nWe expect to see that greatness has\ninherited that write permission.\n\n841\n00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,710\nAll right, so let me find greatness.\n\n842\n00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,820\nAnd, now you can see they have read and\nwrite.\n\n843\n00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,200\nBut, let's say, I was okay with\nyou writing to the game codes.\n\n844\n00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,250\nAs you get new game codes,\nI want you to put them in there so\n\n845\n00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,870\nthat everybody has access\nto those new game codes.\n\n846\n00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:45,520\nI don't want you accidentally deleting or\nmodifying one of these product keys.\n\n847\n00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,460\nAll right?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n848\n00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,960\n>> So,\nI can't change the inherited permissions.\n\n849\n00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,110\nI can't take away right here.\n\n850\n00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:57,180\nI don't wanna take away right from\nthe other file that's in the folder,\n\n851\n00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,590\nso I can't change it to the parent object\nbecause if I take away right at the parent\n\n852\n00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:05,060\nobject, that's gonna inherit down\nto both of those files in there.\n\n853\n00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,350\nI could assign the opposite\npermission to this one file.\n\n854\n00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,820\nThat would work.\n\n855\n00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,407\n>> But that's not the example\nthat we wanna do, right.\n\n856\n00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:12,278\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n857\n00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:14,580\nWe wanna show you guys how\nto permission inheritance or\n\n858\n00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,600\nblocking permission inheritance.\n\n859\n00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,140\nSo as Nate pointed out,\nI'm just gonna go to this.\n\n860\n00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,490\nFile product keys,\nthe one I want to change.\n\n861\n00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,086\nAnd I'm going to click Advance.\n\n862\n00:44:23,086 --> 00:44:28,845\nAnd then I'm gonna go down to the bottom\n,and I'm gonna choose Disable Inheritance.\n\n863\n00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:29,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n864\n00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,330\n>> Which is, as Nate, so eloquently put,\n\n865\n00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,940\nis going to break that tie\nwith that parent object.\n\n866\n00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,190\nIt's no longer gonna\ninherent from the parent.\n\n867\n00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,780\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n868\n00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,020\n>> Now we get two options.\n\n869\n00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,860\nYou notice when I chose\nDisable Inheritance, I get two choices.\n\n870\n00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,735\nI can either take the,\n\n871\n00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:50,910\ncuz if I'm gonna tell it to no\nlonger inherit from the parent.\n\n872\n00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,540\nWell, it's already inherited.\n\n873\n00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,360\nAs soon as I made that\nobject in that folder,\n\n874\n00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,850\nit pulled those permissions\nfrom the parent object.\n\n875\n00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:02,260\nNow I'm telling it to stop doing that,\ndon't inherit anymore.\n\n876\n00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,050\nAnd it's telling me,\n\n877\n00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:06,360\nwhat do you want me to do with the\npermissions that I've already inherited?\n\n878\n00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,480\nDo you want me to leave them in place, and\n\n879\n00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,060\njust convert them into\nexplicit permissions?\n\n880\n00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,600\nSo they're no longer\ninherited permissions,\n\n881\n00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,080\nnow they'll be black check marks,\nwhich I can make changes to.\n\n882\n00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,775\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n883\n00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:21,505\n>> Or, do you want me to remove\nall inherited permissions, and\n\n884\n00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:24,445\nlet you just start with a clean slate,\nall right?\n\n885\n00:45:24,445 --> 00:45:28,165\nAnd I think in this case, it would be\neasiest just to leave those permissions\n\n886\n00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:32,060\nthere, but\nmake them explicit permissions, right?\n\n887\n00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,270\nSo I'll choose convert inherited\npermissions into explicit permissions on\n\n888\n00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,600\nthis object, all right?\n\n889\n00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,940\nAnd now you see none of these\npermissions are being inherited.\n\n890\n00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,290\nThey're still there,\nall the same permissions, but\n\n891\n00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:48,390\nthey're no longer being inherited If I\ncan get my mouse to show close to, yeah,\n\n892\n00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:52,770\nI have to put my mouse almost off the\nscreen to get it to point at that there.\n\n893\n00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,550\nThey're no longer being inherited\nfrom the parent object.\n\n894\n00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:59,720\nSo, when I click okay, which probably\nlooks like I'm clicking in the middle of\n\n895\n00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,310\nthe window, you'll see that those\ncheck marks are now black, all right?\n\n896\n00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,160\nWhich means I can click edit.\n\n897\n00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:09,650\nAnd, I go to greatness, and\nI can take away write permission.\n\n898\n00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,010\nSo, by blocking inheritance,\nthat's the third way I can make\n\n899\n00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,480\nchanges to inherit information\nis to turn off inheritance.\n\n900\n00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,206\nAnd if we take a look at the first file,\n\n901\n00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:25,760\nyou still have greatness still has read\nand write permissions over that one.\n\n902\n00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,038\nWe block inheritance\njust from this one file.\n\n903\n00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:30,941\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n904\n00:46:30,941 --> 00:46:32,304\nNice.\n>> Beautiful.\n\n905\n00:46:32,304 --> 00:46:33,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n906\n00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,911\n>> So that's how we can change that up.\n\n907\n00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:37,720\nAll right?\n\n908\n00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,540\nAnd let's see here, so that covers,\nwe talked about explicit.\n\n909\n00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,630\nWe talked about our implicits.\n\n910\n00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,430\nWe talked about our NTFS permissions.\n\n911\n00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,130\nWhat's next Nate?\n\n912\n00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:57,715\n>> Well, we've got copying,\nright, back and forth amongst us.\n\n913\n00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:58,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n914\n00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,430\n>> I think that's the last thing to do\nwith the NTFS permissions before we get\n\n915\n00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,021\ninto disk quotas.\n\n916\n00:47:06,021 --> 00:47:12,210\nWe'll get into that when we get to it.\n\n917\n00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,650\nYeah, so, yeah.\n\n918\n00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,070\nCopying a.\n\n919\n00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,525\n>> Copying and moving right?\n\n920\n00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:17,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah, because\n\n921\n00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:21,280\nwhat's gonna happen to those\npermissions when I copy a file?\n\n922\n00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,220\nLet's say, I copy it from it's\ncurrent location and make a copy and\n\n923\n00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,471\nput it in another location.\n\n924\n00:47:25,471 --> 00:47:28,628\nOr when I move a file from\none location to another.\n\n925\n00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:29,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n926\n00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,570\n>> And I would tell you that as you go\nout there and you do your studying.\n\n927\n00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,300\nThey make it really, really complex.\n\n928\n00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,570\nBecause it had, first of all there's\na difference between copying and moving.\n\n929\n00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,500\nAnd second, it depends on whether or\nnot you cross partition boundaries.\n\n930\n00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,714\nLike if you're copying it from C colon and\nyou paste the copy somewhere else\n\n931\n00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:53,625\non C colon, or did you paste that\ncopy on D colon, a different volume.\n\n932\n00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:57,292\nIf you move it, are you moving it\nwithin the same partition or volume.\n\n933\n00:47:57,292 --> 00:48:00,172\nOr you're moving it from\none volume to the other.\n\n934\n00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:01,712\nSo there's really four scenarios.\n\n935\n00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,380\nCopying it within the same partition.\n\n936\n00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,955\nCopying it between partitions.\n\n937\n00:48:05,955 --> 00:48:06,700\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n938\n00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,330\n>> Moving it in the same partition or\nmoving it between partitions.\n\n939\n00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,589\nAnd like I said here's my little\nshortcut for you guys out there,\n\n940\n00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:16,400\nwhen you're studying.\n\n941\n00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,540\nThere's only one you have to worry about,\nand that's,\n\n942\n00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,850\nthere's only one that's different,\nI guess is a good way to say it.\n\n943\n00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:26,620\nWhen you move a file\nwithin the same volume, so\n\n944\n00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,980\nyou're not crossing partition\nboundaries or volume boundaries, any\n\n945\n00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,920\nexplicitly assigned permissions to that\nobject are gonna move right along with it.\n\n946\n00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,395\n>> So anything with a black check mark?\n\n947\n00:48:38,395 --> 00:48:39,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n948\n00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,020\n>> Okay.\n>> Anything with a black check mark\n\n949\n00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,060\nis gonna move right along with it,\nexactly.\n\n950\n00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:49,040\nAnything else you do, copy it within\nthe same volume, copy it between volumes,\n\n951\n00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,700\nmoving it between volumes,\nthe explicit information will be lost.\n\n952\n00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,260\nBecause it's going to inherit its\npermissions from its new parent,\n\n953\n00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,580\nwherever you copy it or moved it to.\n\n954\n00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,520\nSo all you really have to remember,\n\n955\n00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,260\nmoving it within the same volume It\nretains its explicit permissions.\n\n956\n00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,075\nAnything else you do, you're gonna\nlose your explicit permissions, and\n\n957\n00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:13,234\nit's gonna inherit permissions\nfrom its new parent object.\n\n958\n00:49:13,234 --> 00:49:13,930\nAll right?\n\n959\n00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,358\n>> Nice.\n\n960\n00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:20,695\n>> And we could get into the nitty-gritty\nof why that's the case, right?\n\n961\n00:49:20,695 --> 00:49:22,655\nIf you're curious out there at home,\n\n962\n00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:27,535\nwhen you move an object within the same\nvolume it's the same object, right?\n\n963\n00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:32,660\nWe were talking about this at break, if\nyou've ever tried to move a 20 gig file,\n\n964\n00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,530\nfrom one folder to another, on the same\nvolume, It's almost instant, right?\n\n965\n00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:38,780\nI mean, it's a 20 gig file.\n\n966\n00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,970\nHow did that happen?\n\n967\n00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:44,370\nWell, all you're really doing is changing\nthe pointer in the file allocation table.\n\n968\n00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,390\nSo, it's still the same object.\n\n969\n00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:51,990\nIf you move it a different volume,\nyou're really doing a cut and paste.\n\n970\n00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,785\nAnd that paste,\n\n971\n00:49:52,785 --> 00:49:56,120\nthat's a new object, and those explicit\npermissions didn't stay with it.\n\n972\n00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,920\nYou deleted the original and\nyou created a copy and\n\n973\n00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,180\npasted it in this other location,\nso it picks up new permissions.\n\n974\n00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,370\n>> So it inherits the permissions\nof the place where it's going to.\n\n975\n00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,570\n>> Yeah, its a new destination.\n\n976\n00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,630\nIts new parent.\n\n977\n00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,255\n>> Right.\n>> He's got new parents, he was adopted.\n\n978\n00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:15,354\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n979\n00:50:15,354 --> 00:50:20,235\n>> So, then, yeah, so, I guess,\nthen I crossing those partitions, right?\n\n980\n00:50:20,235 --> 00:50:23,525\nI guess they're still like you cross\nthe partitions like a little screen\n\n981\n00:50:23,525 --> 00:50:25,215\nis up there, right?\n\n982\n00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:29,955\nAnd as you're coming over, you hit that\nscreen it rakes off everything and\n\n983\n00:50:29,955 --> 00:50:33,997\nit comes through a nice,\nclean copy of whatever it is and\n\n984\n00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:37,117\nthen whenever it lands it\ninherits all that stuff.\n\n985\n00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,267\nJust right then, automatically.\n\n986\n00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:39,517\n>> Exactly.\n\n987\n00:50:39,517 --> 00:50:42,437\nOne more thing I want to point out about\nNTFS, cuz I know we're getting ready to\n\n988\n00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:44,710\nmove on into disk quotas which are really,\nreally cool.\n\n989\n00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,560\nBut the other thing we've\ngot to keep in mind.\n\n990\n00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,175\nAnd you guys covered shared\npermissions in another episode.\n\n991\n00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:51,420\n>> Yes.\n\n992\n00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,410\n>> Important to understand when\nthose permissions are checked.\n\n993\n00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,860\nNTFS permissions are always\nchecked without exception.\n\n994\n00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:04,760\nIn other words, if I'm sitting at this\ncomputer and I double-click on that file,\n\n995\n00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,690\nit's gonna verify that I have NTFS\npermissions to access that file, or\n\n996\n00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,570\nthat folder, or whatever it is.\n\n997\n00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,298\nIf I connect to a mapped drive or\n\n998\n00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:16,952\ngo across the network to get to a resource\nthat's up on a file server somewhere, and\n\n999\n00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:21,605\ndouble-click on one of those files, its\ngonna check NTSF permissions on that file\n\n1000\n00:51:21,605 --> 00:51:24,752\nand make sure that I have\nthe appropriate permissions.\n\n1001\n00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:30,684\nWhereas share permissions are only checked\nwhen you access the object as a share.\n\n1002\n00:51:30,684 --> 00:51:33,645\nMan, now that's like\nwhat do you mean by that?\n\n1003\n00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:35,757\nCuz it can make a difference.\n\n1004\n00:51:35,757 --> 00:51:36,976\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1005\n00:51:36,976 --> 00:51:41,638\n>> If the file is on my computer that I'm\nsitting at, and I double-click on it,\n\n1006\n00:51:41,638 --> 00:51:45,513\neven though it shared out,\neven though the resource is shared,\n\n1007\n00:51:45,513 --> 00:51:47,590\nI'm not accessing it as a share.\n\n1008\n00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,550\nI'm not going across the network.\n\n1009\n00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:53,020\nSo, it's not even going to bother\nlooking at the share permissions.\n\n1010\n00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,930\nIf I go somewhere else and try to access\nthat same resource across the network,\n\n1011\n00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,100\nit is gonna check.\n\n1012\n00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,780\nFor example, if I gave you,\nlet's say I got a folder on here and\n\n1013\n00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,690\nI gave you, but let's back up one second.\n\n1014\n00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,770\n>> Okay.\n>> Because another thing we've gotta know\n\n1015\n00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:12,050\nis, what happens when I combine those two?\n\n1016\n00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:14,190\nDid you guys talk about\nthat in the other episode?\n\n1017\n00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,620\n>> I can't remember.\n\n1018\n00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:19,290\nWe've said that NTFS permissions are\ncumulative, you get to add them all up.\n\n1019\n00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,210\nIf I belong to five groups,\n\n1020\n00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:25,460\nI get to take all the permissions\nfrom all five groups and add them up.\n\n1021\n00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,730\nAnd you're making fun of my hand motions.\n\n1022\n00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:31,588\nI talk with my hands, I don't know\nif you guys have noticed that.\n\n1023\n00:52:31,588 --> 00:52:34,360\nSo NTFS permissions are cumulative.\n\n1024\n00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,505\nYou get to add them all up.\n\n1025\n00:52:35,505 --> 00:52:36,950\nShare permissions are also cumulative.\n\n1026\n00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,320\nIf you have share permissions\nfrom one group and\n\n1027\n00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,930\nshare permissions from another group,\nyou get to add them all up.\n\n1028\n00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:49,069\nWhen we combine share and NTFS permissions\nhowever, it's the most restrictive\n\n1029\n00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:55,210\nof the two whichever one is gonna give\nyou the least amount of permissions.\n\n1030\n00:52:55,210 --> 00:53:00,080\nFor example, let's say on my\ncomputer I create this file.\n\n1031\n00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,400\nWell, let's say I create this folder,\ncuz you can't share files.\n\n1032\n00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:08,830\nI create this folder, and\nI give you NTFS full control,\n\n1033\n00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:12,380\nand share permissions\nI only give you read.\n\n1034\n00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:21,720\nIf you sit at my computer, and\nyou try to access that folder.\n\n1035\n00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,950\nWell your not accessing it to share,\nso share permissions are not checked.\n\n1036\n00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,743\nYou have NTFS full control,\nyou'll have full control of that function.\n\n1037\n00:53:29,743 --> 00:53:31,371\n>> Yeah you can do whatever you want.\n>> Exactly.\n\n1038\n00:53:31,371 --> 00:53:34,959\nIf you go to your computer and\ngo across the network and\n\n1039\n00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:39,825\nconnect to the share, now both share and\nNTFS permissions are checked,\n\n1040\n00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:45,260\nyou have share read, NTFS full control,\nwhich one gives you the least?\n\n1041\n00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:45,800\n>> The share?\n\n1042\n00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,230\n>> The share read, and\nthat's all you're gonna have.\n\n1043\n00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:51,200\nSo here's an object that I'm not\nchanging the permissions on.\n\n1044\n00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,160\nIf you sit at my computer and\ngo to it, you've got full control.\n\n1045\n00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,400\nIf you come across the network and\n\n1046\n00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,360\ngo to the same file,\nyou now only have read permissions.\n\n1047\n00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,610\nSo important to understand\nwhen they're checked.\n\n1048\n00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:04,030\nNTFS permissions,\nalways checked, no matter what.\n\n1049\n00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:07,650\nShare permissions,\nonly checked if you access as a share.\n\n1050\n00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,450\nAnd what does that mean acts as a share?\n\n1051\n00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,820\nThat's a UNC path, a map network drive.\n\n1052\n00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,760\nYou know going across the network\nto get to that resource.\n\n1053\n00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,940\n>> What about like remote desktop?\n\n1054\n00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,190\nWhat if you're remoted into\nthe computer and you check?\n\n1055\n00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,760\nI mean its, you're kind of-\n>> You would think you're going across\n\n1056\n00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,525\nthe network, right?\n\n1057\n00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:27,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But the way you gotta think about it is\n\n1058\n00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:32,320\nwith Remote Desktop, you're pulling that\nremote machine's desktop over to you.\n\n1059\n00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,520\nBut you're still sitting at\nthat remote machine's desktop.\n\n1060\n00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,490\nSo, it's considered an interactive log on,\nand\n\n1061\n00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,825\nyou would be accessing the file locally.\n\n1062\n00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:43,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Twisty concept, I know,\n\n1063\n00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,510\nespecially if you're new to Remote Desktop\nand some of that, so, but in that case,\n\n1064\n00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,510\nno, your share permissions would not be\nchecked if you're doing remote desktop.\n\n1065\n00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:52,300\n>> Nice.\n\n1066\n00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:52,890\n>> Cool beans.\n\n1067\n00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:57,430\n>> Well, sweet, I think,\nyeah, as far as, for\n\n1068\n00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:01,020\nwhat we wanted to do to get into NTFS and\nall that good stuff.\n\n1069\n00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,250\nYou did a fantastic job Mike,\n>> Sorry if I-\n\n1070\n00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,410\n>> Explaining all that stuff.\n\n1071\n00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:07,300\n>> You know I love,\nlike I said NTFS permissions one,\n\n1072\n00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,520\nare very important, right.\n\n1073\n00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,320\nI mean they're the basis of how\nwe keep our resources secure.\n\n1074\n00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,210\nIt's our primary function as an IT person\nto make sure that everybody that needs\n\n1075\n00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:21,290\naccess can, but\nthose that shouldn't don't.\n\n1076\n00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:24,230\nWe do that through our NTFS permissions,\nso it's an extremely important part of\n\n1077\n00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,860\nour job, as well as it's gonna\naffect you on every exam.\n\n1078\n00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,200\nMaybe not a direct permission question.\n\n1079\n00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,540\nBut if you don't understand\nthe way permissions combine,\n\n1080\n00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,280\nif you don't understand\nthe way permissions inherit,\n\n1081\n00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,880\nyou're not gonna be able\nto get that question right.\n\n1082\n00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,380\nSo study these permissions,\nplay with them,\n\n1083\n00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,760\ncreate folders, lock your spouse out.\n\n1084\n00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,600\nGive your kids full control,\ndeny them access on the cross network.\n\n1085\n00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,330\nYou can do whatever you gotta do.\n\n1086\n00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:51,004\nPlay with those permissions, get in there\nand explore, and learn these things and\n\n1087\n00:55:51,004 --> 00:55:52,085\nunderstand them.\n\n1088\n00:55:52,085 --> 00:55:54,125\nCuz they will affect you.\n\n1089\n00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:58,460\n>> Yeah, and one thing that,\nat the house, right?\n\n1090\n00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,080\nWe have a computer in the kitchen and\n\n1091\n00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:06,680\nwe've got our own little laptops and\nsharing things out, sometimes.\n\n1092\n00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,670\nBack in the day,\nI would try to connect to something.\n\n1093\n00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,092\nIt's just not working.\n\n1094\n00:56:10,092 --> 00:56:10,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1095\n00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:16,600\n>> You can't get access or it's not even\nshowing up, and all, a ton of headaches.\n\n1096\n00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,213\n>> Because Tammy locked you out, right?\n\n1097\n00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:22,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's not get too crazy.\n\n1098\n00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:24,820\nJust understanding how access works.\n\n1099\n00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,630\nLocally, over the share.\n\n1100\n00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,330\nYeah, you know, I guess,\n\n1101\n00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:34,030\nyou know, inside outside of you know,\nhere and there and everything.\n\n1102\n00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:34,530\nYeah.\n\n1103\n00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:35,680\nIt makes everything-\n>> It does.\n\n1104\n00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,190\nIt does.\n>> And it's really easy and\n\n1105\n00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,760\nstreamlined and.\n\n1106\n00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,690\n>> Well, something else to keep in\nmind too is some of our home operating\n\n1107\n00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,460\nsystems behave a little bit differently.\n\n1108\n00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,430\nRight?\n\n1109\n00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,750\nWith the shares, and things like that, so\nmake sure you're playing with a pro or\n\n1110\n00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,190\nan enterprise version to see how it's\ngoing to work in a corporate environment,\n\n1111\n00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:54,990\nbecause the home versions you don't have\nthe same access to that access control\n\n1112\n00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:59,790\nlist and that share list and\nthings like that.\n\n1113\n00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:00,670\n>> Good point.\n\n1114\n00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,850\n>> Beautiful.\n\n1115\n00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:02,990\n>> Great job.\n>> Same to you.\n\n1116\n00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:03,520\nLots of

want.\n\n1119\n00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,100\nEveryone's like, no,\nplease Mike shut the heck up.\n\n1120\n00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:14,890\n>> Oh my gosh.\n\n1121\n00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,420\nI was

that computer,\n\n1160\n00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,920\nand then somebody in the evening\nshift uses that same computer, and\n\n1161\n00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,710\nthen maybe even a night shift\nthat uses that computer.\n\n1162\n00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:26,080\nWe can run into a situation\nwhere one of those users.\n\n1163\n00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,630\nEats up all the disk space.\n\n1164\n00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,400\nAnd then the other people that use\nthat computer have no where to\n\n1165\n00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,445\nsave their stuff.\n\n1166\n00:59:31,445 --> 00:59:35,770\nCause you know that guy on night shift\nis downloading all these MP3s and\n\n1167\n00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,750\neating up all that disk space.\n\n1168\n00:59:37,750 -->

that\n\n1176\n00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:56,860\neach user is allocated\na certain amount of space and\n\n1177\n00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:00,230\nthat the other users can't\neat up their disk space.\n\n1178\n01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,940\nAnd when we get into a larger\nenvironment where we've got.\n\n1179\n01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:08,690\nServers and our users are storing\ntheir files up on the servers.\n\n1180\n01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,770\nWe've got other tools that\nwe'll cover in another episode.\n\n1181\n01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:14,870\nFile server resource manager,\nhas a lot more options.\n\n1182\n01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,680\nIt's a lot more flexible.\n\n1183\n01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,850\nBut for a small shop,\nwhere you don't have file servers,\n\n1184\n01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,320\neverything's stored locally, little Soho,\nyou know, you don't have servers.\n\n1185\n01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,940\nServers or at home.\n\n1186\n01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,690\nIf you're tired of the spouse\nusing up all your disk space\n\n1187\n01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:31,130\nyou can now limit how much they have.\n\n1188\n01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,800\nMaking sure that they don't eat up\nall the space on that computer, or\n\n1189\n01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,560\njust limiting how much space they have.\n\n1190\n01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,890\nSo that's where the NTFS\nquotas are really handy.\n\n1191\n01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:43,900\nNTFS disk quotas.\n\n1192\n01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> So we do disk quotas\n\n1193\n01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,060\nkind of two different ways.\n\n1194\n01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:53,470\nThere's what we have a hard quota and\na soft quota.\n\n1195\n01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:59,400\nWith a hard quota, setting this up when,\nsetting up this quota's,\n\n1196\n01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,580\nyou can specify how much\nspace a user can use.\n\n1197\n01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:10,520\nAnd when that user reaches that limit,\nwhether or not they can hit that limit and\n\n1198\n01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,500\nkeep going, or they hit that limit and\nit just stops.\n\n1199\n01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,840\nI think hard quotas may\nnot really be the best.\n\n1200\n01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,750\nWay to go if in some situations if someone\n\n1201\n01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:28,800\ndoes hit that quota and they can't do\nanything it could destroy productivity.\n\n1202\n01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,700\nIt could really.\n\n1203\n01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,940\n>> What if they're in the middle of this\ndocument they've been working on all day\n\n1204\n01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,580\nlong?\n\n1205\n01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,330\nYou know,\nthey spend hours working on this thing.\n\n1206\n01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:39,940\nThey go to save it, and they get\nan error message, your disk is full.\n\n1207\n01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,320\nNow there's a potential that they might\n\n1208\n01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,630\nlose that work if they can't figure\nout what to do to fix that problem.\n\n1209\n01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:48,250\n>> Mm hm.\n>> So yeah,\n\n1210\n01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,420\nyou've kind of got to\ndecide if you want to.\n\n1211\n01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:55,420\nHard limit where you actually stop\nthem at that point or soft quotas.\n\n1212\n01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,670\nSoft quotas as Nate said will\nlet you go right by the limit.\n\n1213\n01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:00,390\nIt'll still generate the same entries,\nright?\n\n1214\n01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,560\nSo we can still go in the event viewer.\n\n1215\n01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,700\nIn our log file system,\nwhere we can see who hit their quota.\n\n1216\n01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,060\nOr who's going beyond that quota.\n\n1217\n01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,180\nSo soft quotas good for auditing.\n\n1218\n01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:15,520\nWe're thinking about putting bigger\nhard drives in those machines.\n\n1219\n01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,450\nAnd before we spend\nthe money on those drives,\n\n1220\n01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,560\nlet's see how much space\neverybody's using.\n\n1221\n01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,680\nLet's see if anybody's using\nmore than ten gigs, alright?\n\n1222\n01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,810\nSo I can set up a quota, a soft quota, and\nthen I can go and look at that entry and\n\n1223\n01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,400\ngo, wow every one of my users\nis using more than 10 gigs, so\n\n1224\n01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,100\nwe definitely need to go buy new\nhard drives for our machines.\n\n1225\n01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:39,110\nSo really more just to see kind of to\naudit what people are using for disk Yeah.\n\n1226\n01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:39,710\nYeah.\n\n1227\n01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:42,380\n>> I guess keep going forward with that.\n\n1228\n01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:43,260\n>> Take a look at it?\n\n1229\n01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,550\n>> Let's set it up.\n\n1230\n01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,270\n>> Let's play.\n\n1231\n01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,050\n>> All right, yeah.\n\n1232\n01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,040\nThat's the fun part.\n\n1233\n01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,860\n>> So what are we going to do here?\n\n1234\n01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,630\nYou want to pull mine up there?\n\n1235\n01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:52,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n1236\n01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:56,640\n>> And we can take a look at, so\nwhat I'm going to do is, I'd better\n\n1237\n01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,590\n>> Stay away from that drive.\n\n1238\n01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:58,930\nWhat do we got on that?\n\n1239\n01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,354\nI better stay away from that one too.\n\n1240\n01:03:00,354 --> 01:03:01,880\n[LAUGH] Let's go ahead and\ndo it on C: here.\n\n1241\n01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,840\n[LAUGH] Gotta be careful, you never\nknow what's on these machines, right?\n\n1242\n01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,860\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1243\n01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,190\n>> What I'm gonna do is, I'm going to\npull up the properties of this volume.\n\n1244\n01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:12,410\n>> Go ahead.\n\n1245\n01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:18,200\n>> With disc quotas,\nwe assign it to the drive.\n\n1246\n01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,870\nTo that volume, so\nit can't at least not with these tools\n\n1247\n01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:27,380\nit can't set it to individual folders.\n\n1248\n01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,000\nSo it just can be the whole drive.\n\n1249\n01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,250\nAnd you get started on it.\n\n1250\n01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:33,960\nYeah.\nSo we've gotta start with the drives\n\n1251\n01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,880\nproperties.\n\n1252\n01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n1253\n01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,870\nSo I'll just go over to this quota tab,\nhandy enough.\n\n1254\n01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:43,660\nAnd we can see that I do\nnot have dispose turned on.\n\n1255\n01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,750\nSo I'm gonna click show quota settings.\n\n1256\n01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:51,500\n>> Of all the tabs,\nthis one gets its own little landing page.\n\n1257\n01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:56,050\nMake sure you really wanna do quotas,\neven before.\n\n1258\n01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:57,880\nGet in there, I don't know what it is.\n\n1259\n01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,750\n>> They do make it seem\na little dangerous.\n\n1260\n01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,170\n>> Yeah, like I just.\n\n1261\n01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:06,370\n>> All right, I'm going to click\nShow Quota Settings and now I'm looking\n\n1262\n01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,750\n>> The quota settings for seek hole and\n\n1263\n01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:12,500\nas Nate pointed out this is done on a per\nvolume basis instead of a per folder basis\n\n1264\n01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:16,160\nand all I'm gonna do to turn it on\n\n1265\n01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,050\nits as simple as putting\na checkmark there that says enable.\n\n1266\n01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:20,490\nQuota management.\n\n1267\n01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,870\nAnd once I check that, you can see\nthat the rest of my options light up.\n\n1268\n01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:27,170\nAnd now I can go and configure my quotas.\n\n1269\n01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:30,800\n>> One thing that I like,\nis the little stop light.\n\n1270\n01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:36,320\nRight now it's on red, and as soon as\nyou click apply, it will go green.\n\n1271\n01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,870\nIt goes to a little green light.\n\n1272\n01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:41,120\n>> That's gonna warn me when I turn this\non that you should enable quotas only if\n\n1273\n01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,290\nyou intend to use quotas on this volume.\n\n1274\n01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,560\nCould take several minutes.\n\n1275\n01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,840\nIf there's a lot of files, cause this is\ngonna be based on ownership of the files.\n\n1276\n01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,640\nIn other words, if I created the file,\nor I'm listed the owner of the file,\n\n1277\n01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,500\nthen that file size counts\ntoward Stores my quota.\n\n1278\n01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,630\nEven if it's in a folder called Nate,\nor even if I was able to put it in your\n\n1279\n01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:04,440\nMy Documents folder, if I'm the owner\nof the file it counts towards my quota.\n\n1280\n01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,660\nAnd if there's several\nfiles out there already.\n\n1281\n01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:10,960\nIf this is a drive that's been used for\na while, there's a lot of data on there\n\n1282\n01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,520\nwhen you enable disc load it's\njust gotta go through and\n\n1283\n01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,580\nstart adding up how much\nspace each user is using.\n\n1284\n01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,830\nAnd that could take a few minutes, it\nould slow your system down a little bit.\n\n1285\n01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:24,500\nSo it might not be something you want to\ndo at nine o'clock in the morning when\n\n1286\n01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,160\nyou're trying to get some work done or\nsomething like that.\n\n1287\n01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:28,770\n>> Really, oops.\n\n1288\n01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,760\nI actually turned it on,\nI'm gonna have to wait awhile.\n\n1289\n01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,665\nWe'll I'm gonna a take a break,\nit's break time.\n\n1290\n01:05:33,665 --> 01:05:35,460\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\nso I'm gonna click OK.\n\n1291\n01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:39,360\nI'm willing to sacrifice\nthe performance at this point.\n\n1292\n01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,030\nAnd it went yellow for a second.\n\n1293\n01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:43,090\n>> Yeah, and now it's green.\n\n1294\n01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:45,480\n>> And it would stay yellow\nthe whole time it was.\n\n1295\n01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,150\nDoing the process,\nnow it's creating meaning, it's done.\n\n1296\n01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,650\nPretty cool little icon.\n\n1297\n01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,540\n>> Yeah.\nI wish they had more icons like that.\n\n1298\n01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,180\n>> I know, we will.\n\n1299\n01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:52,850\n>> We'll see.\n\n1300\n01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,880\n>> All right.\n\n1301\n01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,370\nSo now that we've turned it on the next\nthing to decide is do we want to do a hard\n\n1302\n01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,170\nquota or a soft quota?\n\n1303\n01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,480\n>> Yeah, hard quotas.\n\n1304\n01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,880\nI mean, a little extreme, right, maybe a.\n\n1305\n01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:08,550\nThere's some situations you'd want to\njust cut things completely off there, and\n\n1306\n01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:14,040\nmaybe if you had a space for\ncollectors, something that's\n\n1307\n01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,710\nrunning into a file folder you just want\nto choke off access break other things.\n\n1308\n01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,340\n>> If I had to share my machines with you.\n\n1309\n01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,140\nRight?\nI would want\n\n1310\n01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,640\na hard quote on there because\nI know the way your are.\n\n1311\n01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,890\nYou would eat up all the disk space and\nI would be left with nothing.\n\n1312\n01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:35,190\n>> So\nI guess that would be a denial of service?\n\n1313\n01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:37,570\n>> Yes.\n>> I purposely fill up that drive and\n\n1314\n01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,250\nprevent you from using it.\n\n1315\n01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,090\n>> You know he's got all these saved games\n>> Game\n\n1316\n01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:41,790\nfiles there-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1317\n01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:42,560\n>> And I've got\n\n1318\n01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,770\nnowhere to put my important work Excel\nspreadsheets cause I don't game at work.\n\n1319\n01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:49,150\n>> This guy, yeah well.\n\n1320\n01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:55,100\nActually are we going to get\nthat game fired up after this?\n\n1321\n01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,070\n>> So yeah, so.\n\n1322\n01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:58,920\nIf we want to do a hard quota were going\nto check that little check mark there,\n\n1323\n01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,980\ndeny disc space to users\nexceeding the quota limit.\n\n1324\n01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,620\nIf I don't select that it\nwould be a soft quota.\n\n1325\n01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:08,190\nWe would still have the limit it would\nstill generate the warnings in the log\n\n1326\n01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:12,040\nfile but it would not prevent\nyou from going beyond the limit.\n\n1327\n01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,135\nSo we will go ahead and\ndo a hard quota see what that's all about.\n\n1328\n01:07:15,135 --> 01:07:16,430\nMm-hm.\n\n1329\n01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:19,980\n>> Once I have chosen whether I'm gonna do\na hard or soft quota our next option down\n\n1330\n01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:23,710\nhere is select the default quota for\nnew users on this volume.\n\n1331\n01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,950\n>> For new users, right?\n\n1332\n01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:28,480\n>> Right.\n\n1333\n01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,470\n>> So by setting this.\n\n1334\n01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:31,230\nLimit right here.\n\n1335\n01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:36,380\nCreating those new accounts like\nwe did earlier in the show.\n\n1336\n01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,730\nThen those users then would have this.\n\n1337\n01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,670\n>> Yep.\nIt would automatically be applied.\n\n1338\n01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:44,700\nSo I don't have to go back in\nevery time I had a new user.\n\n1339\n01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,140\nAnd remember to set a quota for\nthat particular user.\n\n1340\n01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,900\nThis will automatically do it.\n\n1341\n01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:49,970\n>> Nice.\n\n1342\n01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,040\n>> When you set quotas here,\n\n1343\n01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,570\nthis is, as we were taking earlier,\nthis is our global setting, right?\n\n1344\n01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,120\nThis is going to affect everybody.\n\n1345\n01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,350\nKeep in mind, too, this affects\nlocal users as well as domain users.\n\n1346\n01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:06,120\nSo anybody that logs onto this machine\nis gonna be subject to this particular\n\n1347\n01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,240\ntype of this quota.\n\n1348\n01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,700\nNow we can also do\nindividual quota entries.\n\n1349\n01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,780\nWell, we'll kind of come\nback to that maybe.\n\n1350\n01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:16,900\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlimit Disk space to.\n\n1351\n01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,340\nSo I choose that radio button\nthere limit disk space to.\n\n1352\n01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,760\nNow I've got two options down there.\n\n1353\n01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,250\nI've got Limit disk space to and.\n\n1354\n01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,360\nSet warning level to.\n\n1355\n01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:31,080\n>> So, yep, two different events, right?\n\n1356\n01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:37,820\nSo one limit, right we get a warning and\nan event log generated.\n\n1357\n01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:42,370\nThis user is getting close, and\nit kicks in at a percentage right?\n\n1358\n01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,340\nGenerates that log.\n\n1359\n01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,390\n>> You can do it by size here.\n\n1360\n01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:50,600\nIt's nice to let them know.\n\n1361\n01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:54,359\nIf I set a limit, let's say for\ngiggles we set a limit at ten megabyte.\n\n1362\n01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:59,420\nGive you a whopping ten\nmegabytes of space.\n\n1363\n01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,220\nDo I want to just wait\nuntil you hit the limit and\n\n1364\n01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,570\nthen let you know that you hit it?\n\n1365\n01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:06,910\nOr do I want to say all right I'm going\nto limit you to ten megabytes but\n\n1366\n01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:10,410\nI'm going to give you a warning\nwhen you get to eight megabytes.\n\n1367\n01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,110\nThat way you're like oh,\nI'm getting close.\n\n1368\n01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:15,350\nMaybe I should delete some of those\nold files I'm not using anymore.\n\n1369\n01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,030\nAlright.\n\n1370\n01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,830\nSo, you can set that warning level.\n\n1371\n01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:20,380\nAnd why won't we do, I don't know,\nwhat do you think Nate?\n\n1372\n01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,610\n>> Yes, this 10 megs.\n\n1373\n01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:23,050\n>> 10 megs?\n>> 10 megs sounds good.\n\n1374\n01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:26,070\n>> For the demo, so we don't have to\ngenerate 10 gigabytes worth of data or\n\n1375\n01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,097\nanything like that,\nto show you what happened.\n\n1376\n01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:28,600\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1377\n01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,950\n>> And then if we're gonna be nice,\n\n1378\n01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:32,570\nmaybe we set a warning at\nsomewhere around eight?\n\n1379\n01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:34,040\n>> Yeah 8 megs.\n\n1380\n01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:34,960\n>> Yeah, okay\n>> Or\n\n1381\n01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,380\nlet's do five\n>> Yeah, I like that\n\n1382\n01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,650\n>> Just round numbers.\n\n1383\n01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,658\n>> Yep\n>> Nice, neat numbers.\n\n1384\n01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:45,260\n5 and 10, and\nthat way when we get in there and\n\n1385\n01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,540\ndo the demo,\nwe can figure out what the settings are.\n\n1386\n01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,350\n>> 5 and 10.\n\n1387\n01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,080\n>> Alright, so\nwe're going to set a limit at 10, but\n\n1388\n01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,570\nwe're going to give it a warning at 5, and\nyou saw the drop down list I've got there.\n\n1389\n01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:57,670\nI could set this you do kilobytes,\nmegabytes, gigabytes, terabytes,\n\n1390\n01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:00,550\npetabytes, exabytes, really?\n\n1391\n01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:03,410\nI'm gonna limit you to one exit byte, so\n\n1392\n01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:06,165\ndon't you dare put more than an x\namount of data on this drive.\n\n1393\n01:10:06,165 --> 01:10:06,667\n[LAUGH]\n>> Per user.\n\n1394\n01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:15,360\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] It's a lot\nof space in here somewhere.\n\n1395\n01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,282\n>> But keep in mind that this could be a\nmachine that has its attached to some kind\n\n1396\n01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:22,655\nof direct attached storage or\nsomething like that where I've got\n\n1397\n01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:25,910\nRAID drives in there and\nI do have that much space.\n\n1398\n01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:30,240\nAnd if you put two exabytes of mp3\nfiles on my drive I'm gonna be angry.\n\n1399\n01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,780\nSo, we'll set that to 5 and 10 and\n\n1400\n01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,420\nthen down below there I've\ngot my logging options.\n\n1401\n01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,710\n>> Yep, logging options, Log event.\n\n1402\n01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,970\nWhen the user exceeds the quota limit.\n\n1403\n01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:45,280\nAnd login event when the user\nexceeds their warning level\n\n1404\n01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,210\n>> Mhm\n\n1405\n01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:48,970\n>> I think both, in both cases you would\n\n1406\n01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:51,360\nselect both of those\n>> I would\n\n1407\n01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:51,900\nthink so\n>> Mhm\n\n1408\n01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,150\n>> And we'll talk about it-- we were\n\n1409\n01:10:55,150 --> 01:11:00,530\ntalking earlier, and this is one\nof my disappointments I have with\n\n1410\n01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:05,700\nNTFS disc quotas alright, so Microsoft\nif you are listening let's fix this here\n\n1411\n01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:10,580\nbecause the problem I have with this is\nthat it does not, says log in event when\n\n1412\n01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:13,360\nlogger exceeds their quota and log in\nevent when they exceed their warning.\n\n1413\n01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,580\nSo it is going to generate\nan event in the File system,\n\n1414\n01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:20,220\nor in the event log system, which we're\ngonna go take a look at in a second.\n\n1415\n01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:24,360\nBut as far as the end user,\nthat is using this computer, many of them,\n\n1416\n01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,810\nmost of them are not gonna be\nadministrators on the machine.\n\n1417\n01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:29,000\nThey might not have\naccess to the event log,\n\n1418\n01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,410\nthey don't know to go look\nin the event log anyway.\n\n1419\n01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:36,859\nSo it doesn't really give them, you would\nwant something to pop up on the screen\n\n1420\n01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:41,129\nthat says, hey, you're getting close to\nyour limit, you might wanna remove some\n\n1421\n01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:43,896\nfiles, something on the end\nuser side that they see.\n\n1422\n01:11:43,896 --> 01:11:46,715\nAnd that's kind of disappointing\ncuz the error that\n\n1423\n01:11:46,715 --> 01:11:49,734\nthey get just tells them that\nthere disk is out of space.\n\n1424\n01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:54,348\nAnd so your average end user's going to\nthink, oh my gosh, my hard drive is full.\n\n1425\n01:11:54,348 --> 01:11:57,110\nAnd they're gonna call up the help desk,\nand they're going to tell,\n\n1426\n01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:59,760\nhey, did you know my\ncomputer's out of disk space?\n\n1427\n01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,095\nAnd you have to tell them no,\nit's only you.\n\n1428\n01:12:02,095 --> 01:12:04,129\nYou've hit your quota.\n\n1429\n01:12:04,129 --> 01:12:07,340\n[LAUGH] So it generates a few\nextra calls to the help desk,\n\n1430\n01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,060\nwhich is something we always try to avoid.\n\n1431\n01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,710\n>> Now, all right, so what about this?\n\n1432\n01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:14,750\nWe haven't quite gotten into task\nscheduler and all those things.\n\n1433\n01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:18,420\nCould we set up a task\nscheduler to look for\n\n1434\n01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,766\none of these events, and\nthen fire off an email to the user.\n\n1435\n01:12:22,766 --> 01:12:26,750\nIt's not as streamlined, but, possible.\n\n1436\n01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,170\n>> With your scripting skills?\n\n1437\n01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:30,440\nWe can get it done.\n>> All right!\n\n1438\n01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,588\n>> I've seen some of your work now.\n\n1439\n01:12:31,588 --> 01:12:35,650\nAnd you absolutely could, in fact, in one\nof our episodes, we'll dive into that\n\n1440\n01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:39,660\nEvent Log system because that's one\nthing Microsoft really has improved.\n\n1441\n01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:44,020\nIt's a good looking Event Log system,\nreally cool things we can do in there, and\n\n1442\n01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:49,270\nwe can attach tasks to\nparticular event IDs.\n\n1443\n01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:52,860\nSo later on we're gonna talk about\nwhat event ID this generates, and\n\n1444\n01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:56,480\nthen I could do exactly as Nate said,\nset up a script that did something\n\n1445\n01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,695\nwhen a particular event ID\ngot fired in the Event Log.\n\n1446\n01:12:58,695 --> 01:12:59,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1447\n01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:01,382\nAnd Windows 8 is awesome.\n\n1448\n01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:05,196\n>> I'm telling you.\n>> My God, does it get any better?\n\n1449\n01:13:05,196 --> 01:13:08,740\n>> Sweet, that's 8.1.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so now we've got\n\n1450\n01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:13,470\nthat, we're going to log both an event\nwhen they hit their warning, and\n\n1451\n01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:15,245\nwhen they hit their quota.\n\n1452\n01:13:15,245 --> 01:13:17,554\nSo we go ahead and apply this bad boy.\n\n1453\n01:13:20,003 --> 01:13:22,070\nAnd we'll click okay.\n\n1454\n01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:24,940\nAnd we'll click okay.\n\n1455\n01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,830\n>> Yeah.\nNo real fireworks.\n\n1456\n01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:30,090\nI mean nothing big, grand, but it's on.\n\n1457\n01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:30,710\n>> It's turned on.\n\n1458\n01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:33,030\n>> It's working.\n>> If we go back into our properties now\n\n1459\n01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,070\nand we go back over to our 1uota tab,\nand we click the show quota, and\n\n1460\n01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:40,105\nwhy they can't just show you here, right?\n\n1461\n01:13:40,105 --> 01:13:43,220\n[LAUGH] One more click,\nthank you Microsoft.\n\n1462\n01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,240\nAnd there's my quota settings for\nC colon, and\n\n1463\n01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,310\nlet's go take a look at\nthese quota entries.\n\n1464\n01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,720\nSo we said at the beginning there that\nwhen we apply these settings here,\n\n1465\n01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,130\nthese are global, all right?\n\n1466\n01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:58,480\nThey affect everybody that's gonna be\nlogging on to that machine, except?\n\n1467\n01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:00,720\n>> Administrators?\n\n1468\n01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,190\n>> Administrators.\n\n1469\n01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:03,422\nIt's good to be the king.\n\n1470\n01:14:03,422 --> 01:14:07,941\nThe administrators,\n\n1471\n01:14:07,941 --> 01:14:13,190\nby default, and their account\ninformation is currently unavailable,\n\n1472\n01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:15,900\noh no, that's there they are at\nthe top there, and who is that,\n\n1473\n01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,710\noh that must be Ronnie's\naccount is being a little\n\n1474\n01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:21,420\nslow there pulling up that user name\n>> Good thing we put quotas\n\n1475\n01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:22,260\non his account\n>> I know, right?\n\n1476\n01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:26,131\n>> It's probably dragging cuz it's\ngotta log all his stuff, already,\n\n1477\n01:14:26,131 --> 01:14:27,450\nwe just barely made it!\n\n1478\n01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:28,140\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n1479\n01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,340\nSorry to hit the limit.\n\n1480\n01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:36,010\nSo here we can see that the built in\nadministrators are setup with a free pass,\n\n1481\n01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,660\nno limit, no limit.\n\n1482\n01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:40,884\nIn fact, oh,\nI am in the administrator's group, and\n\n1483\n01:14:40,884 --> 01:14:44,010\nRonnie's in the administrator's group.\n\n1484\n01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,430\nWhere's Nate's account?\n\n1485\n01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,650\nNate's not even listed here either.\n\n1486\n01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,860\n>> I'm not even in there.\n\n1487\n01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,570\n>> I think I deleted\nyou during that break.\n\n1488\n01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:50,110\n>> Oops.\n\n1489\n01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,301\nYeah.\n\n1490\n01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:52,450\nSafe and sorry I guess.\n\n1491\n01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:53,110\n>> Yeah.\n\n1492\n01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:57,380\nSo point is though while we're in here,\nwhen you create these disk quotas\n\n1493\n01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:00,740\nthey apply to everybody on that machine,\nexcept for the administrators.\n\n1494\n01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,100\nThey get a free pass.\n\n1495\n01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:06,820\nIf I wanted to make an individual\nquota because Nate is in my marketing\n\n1496\n01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:11,310\ndepartment, and he needs to use these\nextra large media files, so I need to give\n\n1497\n01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:15,070\nhim a little more space than I give\neverybody else, I can set an individual\n\n1498\n01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:19,350\nquota here that would override the global\nsettings that we did on that first tab.\n\n1499\n01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:25,580\nAlso shows you if one of these accounts\nwas subject to the quota, I would see\n\n1500\n01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:31,250\nwhat they had used, what they had already\nused, how close they were to their,\n\n1501\n01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:33,450\nwhat their limit was set to, and\nwhat their warning level was set to.\n\n1502\n01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,820\nIn fact, I probably need to make\nan account that's not an administrator so\n\n1503\n01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,000\nwe can kind of test this out.\n\n1504\n01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,670\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1505\n01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:39,270\nShoot, let's do it.\n\n1506\n01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:40,130\nFire it up.\n\n1507\n01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:43,966\n>> All right.\nSo while we're doing that,\n\n1508\n01:15:43,966 --> 01:15:47,400\nlet me just flip over here.\n\n1509\n01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,734\nI'm going to computer management and\nwe'll whip out a quick account here.\n\n1510\n01:15:53,474 --> 01:15:55,563\nHow about good old Wes.\n\n1511\n01:15:55,563 --> 01:15:57,675\n>> Yep, Wes.\n\n1512\n01:15:57,675 --> 01:15:59,836\n>> And we'll go ahead and\ndo it all properly.\n\n1513\n01:15:59,836 --> 01:16:02,270\n>> Aw, Mike.\n\n1514\n01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:06,028\n>> Yeah, you know, little OCD ness.\n\n1515\n01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:09,010\n>> Well, good practice I suppose.\n\n1516\n01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,099\n>> Yes.\n\n1517\n01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,371\nI'll disable his account?\n\n1518\n01:16:12,371 --> 01:16:15,580\nNo.\n[LAUGH] All right, so now I've got another\n\n1519\n01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:21,610\nuser here that I can use that is not\na member of the administrator's group.\n\n1520\n01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:24,260\nSo if we take a peek at our quotas again.\n\n1521\n01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:28,410\nJust created a new user,\nlet's see what it says.\n\n1522\n01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:33,750\nWe'll go to quotas, click quotas a second\ntime, and then we'll click quota\n\n1523\n01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:39,530\nentries, and it hasn't,\nevidently has not refreshed yet.\n\n1524\n01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:40,030\nNice.\n\n1525\n01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:47,140\nLegacy has not logged on yet so you go\nahead and, I'm gonna log off real quick.\n\n1526\n01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:51,170\nCan I do that, with IVGA?\n\n1527\n01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:54,750\n>> Could we just add him and\nan entry, would that work?\n\n1528\n01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:57,026\n>> We could, we could go ahead and\nadd an entry, but here,\n\n1529\n01:16:57,026 --> 01:17:00,380\nwhile we got that turned off I'll go ahead\nand log out and we'll fire that back up.\n\n1530\n01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:05,615\n>> Oh yeah, that's true, because I\nguess for Wes to meet his quota limit\n\n1531\n01:17:05,615 --> 01:17:10,430\nwe would have to log in as Wes,\nand make files and hit that quota.\n\n1532\n01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:14,550\n>> Let's see if we can hit it.\n\n1533\n01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:17,841\nIf I could remember what password I\nused when I created that account like 2\n\n1534\n01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:18,490\nminutes ago.\n\n1535\n01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:19,388\n>> Did you already forget?\n\n1536\n01:17:19,388 --> 01:17:21,199\nI use the same one for all my stuff.\n\n1537\n01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,894\n>> All right so\nthere's setting things up now.\n\n1538\n01:17:22,894 --> 01:17:29,997\n[LAUGH] Good old Windows and\nshowing me how to use the new metro, oops.\n\n1539\n01:17:29,997 --> 01:17:32,290\nThe new Windows interface, can't say.\n\n1540\n01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:36,250\n>> Yeah, modern style there we go.\n\n1541\n01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:39,610\n>> Now setting up disk quotas right,\nso there's.\n\n1542\n01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:40,880\n>> And its pretty.\n\n1543\n01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,110\nNice\n>> It is nice.\n\n1544\n01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,960\nSetting up just quotas, we use the GUI,\n\n1545\n01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:54,320\nthe graphical user interface to set it up,\nwe can also\n\n1546\n01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,635\nuse group policy pushed out if we're in\na domain environment and go that route.\n\n1547\n01:17:59,635 --> 01:18:02,670\nCuz I mean, group policy is like\na catch all for everything.\n\n1548\n01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:05,940\nOf course we could use group\npolicy to do things, and\n\n1549\n01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:09,440\na cool utility right, the Fsutil.\n\n1550\n01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,135\n>> FS Util.\n\n1551\n01:18:10,135 --> 01:18:14,860\n>> Fsutil with the quota switch,\nwould you call it a switch?\n\n1552\n01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,680\nModifier option.\n\n1553\n01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,010\n>> I like switch.\n\n1554\n01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,740\n>> Fsutil quota, and then blank.\n\n1555\n01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,650\nWhatever you want to do with it.\n\n1556\n01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:29,436\nWe can go that route once we get\nthe quota stuff all lined up.\n\n1557\n01:18:29,436 --> 01:18:33,783\nYeah, let's use Fsutil and\nwe'll query that drive and\n\n1558\n01:18:33,783 --> 01:18:36,570\nwe'll get the information for it.\n\n1559\n01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:37,240\n>> I like it.\n\n1560\n01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,320\nI like it.\n\n1561\n01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,530\nIt's still taking care of a few\nthings according to Windows here.\n\n1562\n01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:42,650\nSo, we're waiting.\n\n1563\n01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:44,300\n>> Damn.\nI thought you had the good computer.\n\n1564\n01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,360\n>> You know, evidently, I don't know, man.\n\n1565\n01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,130\n>> That's crazy.\n\n1566\n01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:49,650\n>> It's taking it's time setting\nup Wes's new profile here.\n\n1567\n01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:55,380\nSo, what do we got,\nwe've talked about artist quotas,\n\n1568\n01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:58,190\nwe've talked about the different\nways we can manage it, as Nate said,\n\n1569\n01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:02,530\ngroup policy in a corporate environmen, I\ndon't want have to go touch every machine.\n\n1570\n01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:06,383\nAnd if want to set quotas on all those\nsales machines in there, I don't want to\n\n1571\n01:19:06,383 --> 01:19:09,840\ngo to each one and do them one at a time,\nbecause of a couple of things.\n\n1572\n01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,540\nOne, I can get tired.\n\n1573\n01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,488\nIt's just a lot of work.\n\n1574\n01:19:12,488 --> 01:19:17,110\n[LAUGH] Two, what if I miss one, right?\n\n1575\n01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:19,180\nThere's 50 little cubicles back there.\n\n1576\n01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:22,200\nI go to each one, and\nI miss that one in the corner,\n\n1577\n01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,710\nnow I've got one computer that's in\nviolation of our corporate policies,\n\n1578\n01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,940\nthat doesn't have quota supply to it.\n\n1579\n01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:31,260\nWhat if on one of them,\nI forget to hit the drop down list and\n\n1580\n01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:34,505\nchange it from ten megabytes\nto ten kilobytes, right?\n\n1581\n01:19:34,505 --> 01:19:37,293\nSo now,\nthis guy's got a ten kilobyte limit.\n\n1582\n01:19:37,293 --> 01:19:39,555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's not gonna get to far is he?\n\n1583\n01:19:39,555 --> 01:19:40,940\n>> No.\n>> By using group policy,\n\n1584\n01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:41,958\nI can set it once and\n\n1585\n01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:45,550\nI can have those settings apply\nto those machines automatically.\n\n1586\n01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:48,210\nConsistently no errors.\n\n1587\n01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:52,271\nSo Group Policy eliminates the human\nerror as well as what we call wearing out\n\n1588\n01:19:52,271 --> 01:19:53,490\nthe sneaker net.\n\n1589\n01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:55,960\nRunning around from machine\nto machine to machine.\n\n1590\n01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,980\nPut a hole in your shoes\ndoing all that walking.\n\n1591\n01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:59,490\n>> Can you imaging that new guy, right?\n\n1592\n01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:04,200\nSo you set him up with a 10k limit and\nhe hits it in the first five minutes like\n\n1593\n01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,855\ndang, man this new guys\nalready creating problems.\n\n1594\n01:20:06,855 --> 01:20:08,765\nYeah, dag gum making a lot of noise.\n\n1595\n01:20:08,765 --> 01:20:11,000\n>> Yeah, calling down there\nasking what is going on.\n\n1596\n01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,354\nAnd what if all your machines\naren't in the same location.\n\n1597\n01:20:13,354 --> 01:20:17,098\nI've got an office in Pensacola,\nI've got an office in Birmingham,\n\n1598\n01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:19,831\nI've got an office here and\nthere and everywhere.\n\n1599\n01:20:19,831 --> 01:20:22,431\n>> Detroit.\n>> I don't know if I can convince my boss\n\n1600\n01:20:22,431 --> 01:20:25,080\nto fly me out there just\nto set up disk quotas.\n\n1601\n01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:29,820\nIf I use group policy I can\ndo my centralized management.\n\n1602\n01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,843\n>> Or\nmaybe you can use your management tools.\n\n1603\n01:20:32,843 --> 01:20:33,600\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n1604\n01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:39,348\n>> To remotely manage that computer\nto connect to it through a desktop or\n\n1605\n01:20:39,348 --> 01:20:42,030\nwhatever the other tools were.\n\n1606\n01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:44,804\n>> And\nthat was a great episode you guys did.\n\n1607\n01:20:44,804 --> 01:20:48,593\nSo take a look on ITProTV or\non that Roku channel and\n\n1608\n01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:53,820\nwhat that episode on our remote\nserver administration tools.\n\n1609\n01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,258\n>> No reason to get up and\ngo over there, right?\n\n1610\n01:20:56,258 --> 01:20:59,735\nMan, this [CROSSTALK]-\n>> I would say that something doesn't\n\n1611\n01:20:59,735 --> 01:21:02,926\nappear to be correct here at this point.\n\n1612\n01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:08,350\nOh, I didn't disconnect from my\nVGA maybe before I did that?\n\n1613\n01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:08,883\n>> I dunno.\n\n1614\n01:21:08,883 --> 01:21:10,252\nSurely, that can't be it.\n\n1615\n01:21:10,252 --> 01:21:12,005\n>> It's crazy computers.\n\n1616\n01:21:12,005 --> 01:21:14,710\n>> It's telling me right now,\nat this point, don't turn off your PC.\n\n1617\n01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:16,550\nGetting your apps ready.\n\n1618\n01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,920\nIt's building a new profile,\n\n1619\n01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,920\nnew user account, first time\nthey've logged onto this machine.\n\n1620\n01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,280\nIt's setting up my profile,\nand all of that good stuff.\n\n1621\n01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,970\nSo, tell you what,\nwe are pretty close to our break here.\n\n1622\n01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:29,682\n>> Oh, man.\n>> So why don't we go ahead and\n\n1623\n01:21:29,682 --> 01:21:30,640\ntake our break.\n\n1624\n01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,320\nWe come back maybe this thing\nwill be done, maybe it won't.\n\n1625\n01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,635\nI will punt it across\nthe room if it's not.\n\n1626\n01:21:35,635 --> 01:21:36,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1627\n01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:41,700\nthen we've got to cover our\nauditing object access as well.\n\n1628\n01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,581\nSo we'll finish this thing up.\n\n1629\n01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:44,777\nIt says it's almost ready.\n\n1630\n01:21:44,777 --> 01:21:48,155\nSo another Mountain Dew and\nshould be good to go.\n\n1631\n01:21:48,155 --> 01:21:49,294\n>> After the break.\n\n1632\n01:21:49,294 --> 01:21:57,118\n[MUSIC]\n\n1633\n01:21:57,118 --> 01:21:58,719\nAnd welcome back.\n\n1634\n01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:01,403\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n1635\n01:22:01,403 --> 01:22:06,777\nwe got our little quota thing set up,\nready to roll.\n\n1636\n01:22:06,777 --> 01:22:10,074\n>> Yep.\n>> We created a user account.\n\n1637\n01:22:10,074 --> 01:22:11,315\n>> I'll pull it up while\nyou're talking about it.\n\n1638\n01:22:11,315 --> 01:22:12,090\n>> Yep.\n\n1639\n01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:14,300\nWell, Mike's going to pull it up.\n\n1640\n01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,830\nSo we went with Don, Don Pazet.\n\n1641\n01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:19,260\nWe created a user account for this guy.\n\n1642\n01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:25,180\nWe changed our quota limit a little for\nthe demo today.\n\n1643\n01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,259\n>> A little interesting\nnote that we just learned.\n\n1644\n01:22:28,259 --> 01:22:32,410\nWe set up the quota to rather small,\nso that we can hit it really easy, so\n\n1645\n01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:35,160\nthat we can generate the thresholds or\n\n1646\n01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,320\nthe triggers in the event log, or\ntrigger the event in the event log.\n\n1647\n01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,540\nAnd come to find out,\nwhen you set up a new account like that,\n\n1648\n01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:47,650\nthat initial profile is 120 I think,\nsomewhere around there.\n\n1649\n01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:52,440\nSo, just trying to set up the new\nuser's profile it was unable to do so\n\n1650\n01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:56,100\nbecause it had to connect to the store,\ndownload the apps that come by default.\n\n1651\n01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:01,170\nAnd that was why it was taking so\nlong was because it was out of space.\n\n1652\n01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:05,310\nIt had hit his quota and\nwe set a hard quota.\n\n1653\n01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:08,580\nSo, Windows could not finish\nsetting up his Profile.\n\n1654\n01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:09,740\nSo lesson learned there.\n\n1655\n01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,000\nAll right.\n\n1656\n01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,360\nSo now what we've got is\nwe've got a 1 GB max, or\n\n1657\n01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:21,110\nthe limit, we've got a 250 MB warning.\n\n1658\n01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:23,411\nIf we click on our quota entries,\n\n1659\n01:23:23,411 --> 01:23:28,030\nI can see that Don's account that\nwe just set up, has used 108.\n\n1660\n01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:31,650\nHe's got a quota limit of 1 gigabyte.\n\n1661\n01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:34,970\nHe's got a warning level of 250 megabytes.\n\n1662\n01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:37,320\nHe's used 10% of his space so far.\n\n1663\n01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,310\nSo nice that it gives\nyou this information.\n\n1664\n01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:42,140\nThe rest of these accounts are all\nin the administrators group.\n\n1665\n01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,840\nAs we can see, they have no quota.\n\n1666\n01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,100\nSo, there's the free pass for\nthe administrators.\n\n1667\n01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:49,795\nPoor Wes, his profile got chopped there.\n\n1668\n01:23:49,795 --> 01:23:51,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's just stuck right now.\n\n1669\n01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:54,210\nSo, Wes, if you're watching man, my bad.\n\n1670\n01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:55,230\nI'll hook you up later.\n\n1671\n01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:58,530\nAll right, so we'll get out of there.\n\n1672\n01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,110\nSo what's next?\n\n1673\n01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:00,060\nWhat do we want to do now?\n\n1674\n01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:03,450\nKinda want to try to hit that thing?\n\n1675\n01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:09,360\n>> So we can use the fsutil\nthat we looked at earlier.\n\n1676\n01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:16,940\nWe can use that guy to create a phantom\nfile with a specific size limit.\n\n1677\n01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:20,949\nWe're gonna use that to\npush Don's profile past\n\n1678\n01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:25,554\nthat 250 megabyte threshold and\ngenerate an event.\n\n1679\n01:24:25,554 --> 01:24:28,420\nEd will go and check it out, look at it.\n\n1680\n01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,280\n>> Just have trouble\ngetting to the C drive.\n\n1681\n01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,440\nIt's not my day today.\n\n1682\n01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,952\nLet's see, so fs\n>> Is\n\n1683\n01:24:34,952 --> 01:24:36,580\nthat an administrative command prompt?\n\n1684\n01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:38,520\n>> No.\n\n1685\n01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,910\nYou know what?\nI'm not logged on as Wes.\n\n1686\n01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,080\nGood call.\n\n1687\n01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:46,160\nActually because I was to create that file\nmyself, it would count towards my quota,\n\n1688\n01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,470\nso I'd be the owner of the file.\n\n1689\n01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:53,930\n>> Could you go in and go into\nthe owner and select Wes as the owner?\n\n1690\n01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:56,490\n>> I could change the owner of the file.\n\n1691\n01:24:56,490 --> 01:25:02,234\nOr what I could try to do-\n>> Run it as Wes, or Don?\n\n1692\n01:25:02,234 --> 01:25:03,997\n>> Yeah, let's try that.\n\n1693\n01:25:03,997 --> 01:25:05,084\n>> All right.\n\n1694\n01:25:05,084 --> 01:25:06,840\n>> Don's not an administrator.\n\n1695\n01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,670\n>> Right, exactly,\n\n1696\n01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:12,230\nso we don't need administrative access to\nright, he has right access to that drive.\n\n1697\n01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:13,020\n>> We'll find out.\n\n1698\n01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:18,280\n>> I'm supposed to do Don, Don's favorite\npassword that Don doesn't even know,\n\n1699\n01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,120\nand it still gives me\nMike's profile there.\n\n1700\n01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,870\nSo we are going to log off.\n\n1701\n01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:24,640\nAnd we are going to switch users now.\n\n1702\n01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,660\nWe are going to see what happens\nwith good old IVGA here.\n\n1703\n01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:31,720\nI may drop my connection.\n\n1704\n01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:35,673\nAnd I can bring it back up\nonce we logged on, right?\n\n1705\n01:25:35,673 --> 01:25:36,381\n>> Yeah.\n\n1706\n01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,820\nWell, that's right because\nyou can just browse into.\n\n1707\n01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:39,774\nOh, but it's on your.\n\n1708\n01:25:39,774 --> 01:25:40,730\n>> That's okay.\n\n1709\n01:25:40,730 --> 01:25:42,831\n[CROSSTALK] Let's see here.\n\n1710\n01:25:42,831 --> 01:25:46,570\n>> We'll get in there and\ncreate that new file.\n\n1711\n01:25:46,570 -->

to it.\n\n1714\n01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,334\nThat would have helped.\n\n1715\n01:25:56,334 --> 01:25:58,880\n>> Yeah.\nSo, yeah.\n\n1716\n01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,640\n>> So what we're gonna do,\nwe're getting into Don's profile.\n\n1717\n01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:07,110\nAnd he's got a little bit more space\nto go to reach that warning level and\n\n1718\n01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:10,200\nto generate the event,\nwhich is what we're after.\n\n1719\n01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,210\nThat event, so we can get into\nthe event log and look for it.\n\n1720\n01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:18,858\nAnd I guess just show that everything\nis working that we say it is.\n\n1721\n01:26:18,858 --> 01:26:25,306\n[NOISE]\n[LAUGH]\n\n1722\n01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:26,733\n>> It's no fun not being the

going.\n\n1727\n01:26:40,786 --> 01:26:43,886\n>> Let's change that to just a nice,\nsolid color here.\n\n1728\n01:26:47,705 --> 01:26:51,920\n>> Something plain and washed out for

we'll create the file here\nas Don and you won't be able to\n\n1737\n01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,597\n>> See me create this file, which is oh so\n\n1738\n01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:19,951\ndisappointing, not really\nit's just a file, right?\n\n1739\n01:27:19,951 --> 01:27:24,744\n>> The command to do that is\n\n1740\n01:27:24,744 --> 01:27:30,920\nfsutil file createnew\n>> That's all one

01:27:37,963\n>> We set our limit at 200.\n\n1744\n01:27:37,963 --> 01:27:40,482\nI think our warning was at 250.\n\n1745\n01:27:40,482 --> 01:27:44,342\nSo let's go ahead and make a 200,\nlet's make a 300 megabyte file.\n\n1746\n01:27:49,502 --> 01:27:52,252\n>> All right.\n\n1747\n01:27:52,252 --> 01:27:52,872\nOh.\n\n1748\n01:27:52,872 --> 01:27:54,172\nForgot to give it a name,

is.\n\n1757\n01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:08,930\n>> All right.\n\n1758\n01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,560\n>> So it'll go into Don's profile there.\n\n1759\n01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,760\n>> Nice.\n>> All right, so\n\n1760\n01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,610\nthere's a file that we just created.\n\n1761\n01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:17,010\nIt's called 300, and I'm gonna go ahead\nand make the second file as well.\n\n1762\n01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:18,788\nEven though we're not\nshowing you each step,\n\n1763\n01:28:18,788 --> 01:28:20,895\nwe'll still get to see\nthe events that are generated.\n\n1764\n01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:23,280\nSo 300, that should get him, you know,\n\n1765\n01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:27,100\nthat 300 megabytes should get him\nto the threshold of the warning.\n\n1766\n01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:32,970\nThen we need to go past a gigabyte or\ntry to go past a gigabyte to see if the.\n\n1767\n01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:35,440\nThe quota's gonna stop\nme from doing that so\n\n1768\n01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,330\nI'm going to repeat the command\nwith a different name.\n\n1769\n01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:45,238\nAnd we'll call it limit.txt and\nthat last one was 300 megs, so\n\n1770\n01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:47,689\nwe're just gonna add a few zeros.\n\n1771\n01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,982\nTo make that 300 gigs.\n\n1772\n01:28:50,982 --> 01:28:52,880\n>>

--> 01:31:06,480\nYeah, I don't see the warning.\n\n1812\n01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,710\n>> NTFS.\n>> Oh, did you see one?\n\n1813\n01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,210\nOh, right there?\n\n1814\n01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:14,730\nNope, that's just telling\nme my partition is healthy.\n\n1815\n01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:17,853\nEverything is looking good there.\n\n1816\n01:31:20,603 --> 01:31:24,262\nSo yeah, I don't see the warning threshold\none, but with the issues I had trying to\n\n1817\n01:31:24,262 --> 01:31:28,400\nswitch between accounts, there's a good\nchance it might've got lost somewhere.\n\n1818\n01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,310\nWe can definitely see the one\nwhere he hit his quota.\n\n1819\n01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:36,117\nSo that's telling me that\nnow I can go in here and\n\n1820\n01:31:36,117 --> 01:31:40,770\nsee that somebody has tried to save more\nfiles than they were allowed to save.\n\n1821\n01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:41,770\nBeautiful.\n\n1822\n01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:46,545\n>> Yeah, and\nwith the event IDs some of the more common\n\n1823\n01:31:46,545 --> 01:31:52,160\nthings it would be a good idea\nto memorize a few of them.\n\n1824\n01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:52,810\n>> Yeah.\n\n1825\n01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:55,860\n>> Just make searching through\nthe event viewer a little bit quicker,\n\n1826\n01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:58,050\na little bit better, sorta thing.\n\n1827\n01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,630\n>> Yeah, yup.\nIf you wanna pull my screen up one more\n\n1828\n01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:04,870\ntime, I can at least show you where,\nwe can see,\n\n1829\n01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:07,990\nhere's my entry right above\nthe one I have selected.\n\n1830\n01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:11,580\nIs the entry for Don, the account\nthat I was just using to test this.\n\n1831\n01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:15,290\nI can see that his quota limit's one gig,\nhis warning is 250.\n\n1832\n01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,603\nHe's using 40% of it.\n\n1833\n01:32:17,603 --> 01:32:19,936\nHe's at 417 megs.\n\n1834\n01:32:19,936 --> 01:32:22,130\nYou can see the little\nwarning symbol over there.\n\n1835\n01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:26,730\nGive me an indication that this\nuser is past their warning limit.\n\n1836\n01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:30,340\n>> Very nice.\nIt's a beautiful thing when it works.\n\n1837\n01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,290\nSo sweet.\n\n1838\n01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,310\nYeah, there we go.\n\n1839\n01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:34,895\nThat is the disk quotas.\n\n1840\n01:32:34,895 --> 01:32:35,561\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n1841\n01:32:35,561 --> 01:32:36,200\n>> Great stuff.\n\n1842\n01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:41,017\nAnd disk quotas,\nyeah running it on the volume,\n\n1843\n01:32:41,017 --> 01:32:48,436\nit does have to be an NTFS Volume to use\nthis quota, [CROSSTALK] Early or not.\n\n1844\n01:32:48,436 --> 01:32:51,102\n>> I don't think we did but\nit is an NTFS attribute, or\n\n1845\n01:32:51,102 --> 01:32:53,690\nproperty of the NTFS file system.\n\n1846\n01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:55,510\n>> All right moving right along,\n\n1847\n01:32:55,510 --> 01:33:01,380\nthe last little bit that we have to\ntouch on is object access auditing.\n\n1848\n01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,900\n>> Object access auditing, good one.\n\n1849\n01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:07,380\n>> Now there's different kinds of\nauditing, I mean different things, and\n\n1850\n01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:11,050\nonce we get into\nthe auditing stuff later on,\n\n1851\n01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:15,728\nwhen we get into the yeah,\npolicy to turn it on or what not.\n\n1852\n01:33:15,728 --> 01:33:17,790\nThere's different things; for this one,\n\n1853\n01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:21,390\nit's just gonna be this\nobject access running.\n\n1854\n01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:26,242\n>> Yeah, you have, Jason,\nif you wanna pull me up again,\n\n1855\n01:33:26,242 --> 01:33:29,979\nI'm gonna open up .msc, right?\n\n1856\n01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:33,160\nThat's gonna give me that\nlocal security policy.\n\n1857\n01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,200\nYeah.\n\n1858\n01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,780\nAnd there's nine categories in here.\n\n1859\n01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:40,930\nI'm going to expand out\nmy local policies and\n\n1860\n01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:44,080\nthen I'm going to click\non audit policy here.\n\n1861\n01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,870\nAnd I can see that I've\ngot nine categories.\n\n1862\n01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:48,900\nWe'll talk about these in a later episode.\n\n1863\n01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,270\nWe'll go over some of the other ones.\n\n1864\n01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:52,160\n>> Yeah, that's what I was talking about,\nall those different kinds.\n\n1865\n01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,920\n>> Exactly.\nAnd the one we want to look at today is\n\n1866\n01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:00,710\nthe Audit Object Access which allows\nme to audit, access, to objects.\n\n1867\n01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:02,480\nHey, how about that, right.\n\n1868\n01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,560\nDon't you love it when I define a term\nby just by flipping the words around.\n\n1869\n01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,750\n>> Yeah, I like that, that's good.\n\n1870\n01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:10,770\n>> Yeah, this allows you to, when people\nare accessing files or folders or\n\n1871\n01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:14,470\nthings like that,\nif I've got some sensitive information or\n\n1872\n01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:17,950\nI want to see who's been\nmodifying that employee handbook.\n\n1873\n01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:19,570\nSomeone's making some changes in there,\n\n1874\n01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,510\nputting some stuff that\nwe don't want in there.\n\n1875\n01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:25,320\nAnd I need to know who, so\nI can audit that object access.\n\n1876\n01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,680\nSo two part process, two.\n\n1877\n01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:28,880\nGo ahead.\n\n1878\n01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,770\n>> Yeah, we won't be able to\ntell what changes were made.\n\n1879\n01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:37,630\nBut we, it would log who accessed it,\nwhat time,\n\n1880\n01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:41,500\nwhat machine, you know for\nthe, the success audits.\n\n1881\n01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:45,070\nWe can do failure audits,\nto see who's trying.\n\n1882\n01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:48,270\nYou know if we got\nthe Janitor late at night and\n\n1883\n01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:52,460\nhe's trying to login to stuff that we know\nhe shouldn't and we log those events.\n\n1884\n01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:53,410\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1885\n01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:57,520\nNow in one of our later episodes we'll\ntalk more about, we'll get into servers.\n\n1886\n01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:01,600\nWe'll talk about some of these new\ncategories, this advanced audit policy\n\n1887\n01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:07,595\nthat you see down here, there's actually\n53 new categories that we can audit.\n\n1888\n01:35:07,595 --> 01:35:09,240\nThey're kind of categorized here and\n\n1889\n01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:12,980\nif I go down to object access, I'll see\nthat there is actually a whole slew\n\n1890\n01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:17,190\nof additional object access auditing\nthat I can do for this exam.\n\n1891\n01:35:17,190 --> 01:35:21,247\nFor the Windows 8 though we're concerned\nprimarily with this general category which\n\n1892\n01:35:21,247 --> 01:35:24,020\nis gonna be the read audit object access.\n\n1893\n01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,950\n>> Your mouse is still just-\n>> Yeah it's way off it looks like I'm not\n\n1894\n01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:28,386\neven clicking on the screen, right?\n\n1895\n01:35:28,386 --> 01:35:30,132\nIt's a little strange here.\n\n1896\n01:35:30,132 --> 01:35:32,200\nAudit object access,\n\n1897\n01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,900\nwhen you turning on auditing like\nthis it is a two part process.\n\n1898\n01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:38,670\nOne you've gotta enable\nauditing on the machine itself.\n\n1899\n01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:43,250\nI've got to tell my machine that\nI wanted to audit object access.\n\n1900\n01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:46,750\nSo we do that by double-clicking on\nthis guy, or right-click properties,\n\n1901\n01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:47,940\neither way it will work.\n\n1902\n01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:49,130\nAnd then I've got a choice.\n\n1903\n01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:54,250\nI can do success or failure, and it really\ndepends on what you're trying to audit.\n\n1904\n01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:58,120\nDo I care when somebody\nfails to make a change?\n\n1905\n01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,130\n>> Maybe.\n\n1906\n01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:00,210\n>> Maybe, maybe not, right?\n\n1907\n01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:02,356\n>> If they're not supposed to\nbe able to make a change and\n\n1908\n01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:06,070\nthey fail to make a change, that means\nmy NTFS permissions are doing their job.\n\n1909\n01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:08,050\nAnd maybe I don't need to see that.\n\n1910\n01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,960\nOr maybe I want to see who's at\nleast trying to make a change, and\n\n1911\n01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:11,570\nnot succeeding.\n\n1912\n01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:14,010\nDo I want to see success?\n\n1913\n01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:17,710\nDo I want to know when somebody's\nsuccessfully makes a change to that.\n\n1914\n01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:20,550\nProbably, right?\n\n1915\n01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:24,730\n>> Yeah,\nlet the user get access to something and\n\n1916\n01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:27,190\nlet them go through\nlike I told you not to.\n\n1917\n01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:29,330\n>> Yeah, exactly and you've gotta decide.\n\n1918\n01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:33,280\nAnd if you've got dozens of users that\nare supposed to be able to change this.\n\n1919\n01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:38,510\nAnd maybe you don't, because you can end\nup generating a lot of entries in there,\n\n1920\n01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:39,770\ndepending on how you set this up.\n\n1921\n01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:44,070\nBut, so first step in auditing is to\ntell your computer tell the machine,\n\n1922\n01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:47,920\nin this case my local machine,\nthat I wanna audit object access.\n\n1923\n01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,830\nSo we come in here, we turn on success\nfailure, and we're gonna click OK.\n\n1924\n01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:56,105\nAnd we'll click OK on that, so\nthat was all we needed for there.\n\n1925\n01:36:56,105 --> 01:36:57,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1926\n01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:57,990\n>> Next step.\n\n1927\n01:36:57,990 --> 01:37:04,300\n>> Next step is to configure what it is\nthat we want to turn auditing on for.\n\n1928\n01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,860\n>> Yeah,\ncuz we told it we want to audit but\n\n1929\n01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,300\nwe didn't tell it what we want to audit.\n\n1930\n01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:09,230\nWe don't wanna audit everything.\n\n1931\n01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:11,410\nThat would just generate a huge,\n\n1932\n01:37:11,410 --> 01:37:15,155\nhuge log file, eat up all my disk space,\ncause my machine to crash, whatever.\n\n1933\n01:37:15,155 --> 01:37:18,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know we fill up that disk space and\n\n1934\n01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,190\nWindows is gonna fail.\n\n1935\n01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:21,150\nRight, if it runs out of space.\n\n1936\n01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:22,870\n>> That's like worst case scenario.\n\n1937\n01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:23,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> If I fill it up,\n\n1938\n01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,000\nmy computer's going to crash.\n\n1939\n01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,950\n>> And believe it or not,\nit'll happen relatively quick.\n\n1940\n01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:29,740\nIf you wanted it,\neverything on the C drive,\n\n1941\n01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:34,620\nthink about how many times you access your\nsystem files, everything you click on.\n\n1942\n01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:39,880\nEverything is gonna generate an entry in\nthere and it will eat it up pretty quick.\n\n1943\n01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:40,750\nAll right.\n\n1944\n01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:42,460\nBut anyway, so what do you wanna audit?\n\n1945\n01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:43,960\nThis folder we created earlier?\n\n1946\n01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:44,700\n>> I think so.\nI think so.\n\n1947\n01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:45,980\n>> Go back to that test folder?\n\n1948\n01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:49,532\n>> Yep, we can audit that guy.\n\n1949\n01:37:49,532 --> 01:37:51,790\nWe can see who's going to\nbe getting in there and\n\n1950\n01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:56,770\nmaybe we want to know who's adding or\nchanging the game codes.\n\n1951\n01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:58,650\n>> We want to do the file inside there.\n\n1952\n01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,820\nSo let's go inside test and\n\n1953\n01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:04,070\nwe'll find that game codes file\nthat we want to audit access to.\n\n1954\n01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:08,690\nAnd we're going to pull up\nthe properties of that file.\n\n1955\n01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:13,780\nNow, we talked earlier about the the DACL,\nthe Discretionary Access Control List,\n\n1956\n01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:15,190\nwhere we set our permissions, right?\n\n1957\n01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:16,350\nOur NTFS permissions.\n\n1958\n01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:20,990\nFor the auditing,\nthat's all done on something called\n\n1959\n01:38:20,990 --> 01:38:26,830\nthe System Access Control List or\nthe SACL for short, the S-A-C-L.\n\n1960\n01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:31,790\nAnd we get to that by going down\ninto our advanced security.\n\n1961\n01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:36,720\nSo on the security tab, we click Advanced,\nand then I've got my auditing tab.\n\n1962\n01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,410\nAll right, so I click on there.\n\n1963\n01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:41,520\nAnd it tells me I've gotta\nbe an administrator.\n\n1964\n01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,580\nAm I?\nYes I am.\n\n1965\n01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,270\nSo lets continue.\n\n1966\n01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:45,705\nI think I did,\ndid I log back on as me yeah.\n\n1967\n01:38:45,705 --> 01:38:48,428\n[LAUGH] Make sure I'm not\nlogged on as Don still.\n\n1968\n01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:50,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right and\n\n1969\n01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:56,210\nnow this is my system access\ncontrol list or my SACL for short.\n\n1970\n01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:58,550\nI know, funny name, right.\n\n1971\n01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:00,090\nIt makes me giggle every time.\n\n1972\n01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:02,140\nI feel like such a little teenager.\n\n1973\n01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:03,668\nHa, ha, ha, you said SACL.\n\n1974\n01:39:03,668 --> 01:39:05,770\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1975\n01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:09,880\nSo, on my Auditing tab here I'm\ngonna have to add an entry.\n\n1976\n01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:10,640\nSo I click Add.\n\n1977\n01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:15,540\nAnd the first thing I do is\ndecide who do I want to audit.\n\n1978\n01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:17,350\nWhich is the principle.\n\n1979\n01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:18,900\n>> Yes, my security principle.\n\n1980\n01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,770\nWho am I trying to determine\nif they're accessing this?\n\n1981\n01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:25,790\nAgain, thinking about how these\nlog files can grow really quick,\n\n1982\n01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:29,690\nif everybody in sales is allowed\nto make changes to this file,\n\n1983\n01:39:29,690 --> 01:39:31,220\nthen maybe I don't want to audit them.\n\n1984\n01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:36,080\nI'm just trying to find out when\nsomebody in the marketing department,\n\n1985\n01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:38,400\nwho shouldn't be making changes,\nis making changes.\n\n1986\n01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,735\nSo, you can pick and choose who you want\nto audit or you can simply audit everyone.\n\n1987\n01:39:41,735 --> 01:39:42,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1988\n01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:44,505\n>> We can do the everyone,\nwhich is what I think we'll do here.\n\n1989\n01:39:44,505 --> 01:39:46,201\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1990\n01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:50,155\nAll right so\nyou tell it who you want to audit.\n\n1991\n01:39:51,355 --> 01:39:54,975\nThen I do I wanna do success,\nfailure, or all.\n\n1992\n01:39:54,975 --> 01:39:59,385\nNow remember in our group policy area in\nour local security policy I said success\n\n1993\n01:39:59,385 --> 01:40:00,470\nand failure.\n\n1994\n01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:04,120\nThat doesn't tell it to automatically\ndo success and failure,\n\n1995\n01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:08,060\nthat just says the machine is\nable to do success and failure.\n\n1996\n01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:11,610\nI still get to pick what I want to\naudit on each individual resource.\n\n1997\n01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:16,090\nIf I didn't turn it on though,\nif I just choose success and\n\n1998\n01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:19,400\nthe policy and did not choose failure,\nI couldn't choose fail\n\n1999\n01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:23,120\nhere because I didn't tell the machine\nit was allowed to do failure audits.\n\n2000\n01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,740\nLets do all lets just go all out.\n\n2001\n01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:29,470\nAnd then you've gotta decide what\npermissions you wanna audit.\n\n2002\n01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:32,630\nLike I don't wanna know when somebody\nreads it because they read it everyday.\n\n2003\n01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:36,005\nWhat I'm really concerned with is when\nsomebody make changes to that document.\n\n2004\n01:40:36,005 --> 01:40:39,241\nSo I want to audit right or\nsomebody deletes it I wanna know so\n\n2005\n01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:43,215\nmaybe I wanna do modify or maybe I\nwanna monitor audit everything right.\n\n2006\n01:40:43,215 --> 01:40:48,400\nWe can do full control so auditing\nwhatever permission they use right?\n\n2007\n01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,700\n>> Yeah, let's do full control.\n\n2008\n01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:50,450\n>> All right.\n>> Let's just\n\n2009\n01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:52,790\naudit whatever's gonna go\non with these game codes.\n\n2010\n01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:54,050\nIt is that important.\n\n2011\n01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:55,510\n>> They are pretty darn important.\n\n2012\n01:40:55,510 --> 01:40:56,800\n>> We just audit everything.\n\n2013\n01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:01,360\n>> All right, so\nwe'll do the whole kit and caboodle.\n\n2014\n01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,085\nWe click OK.\n\n2015\n01:41:02,085 --> 01:41:03,670\n[LAUGH] Sorry.\n\n2016\n01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:07,120\nThat's one of my mom's sayings that\nI've picked up from my childhood.\n\n2017\n01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:07,740\n>> How cute, how cute.\n\n2018\n01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:09,280\nThe whole kit and caboodle there.\n\n2019\n01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,505\nThanks, mom.\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n2020\n01:41:12,505 --> 01:41:15,070\nI gotta get my mom a Roku so\nshe can watch this stuff you know?\n\n2021\n01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:16,320\n>> Yeah.\nAll the time.\n\n2022\n01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,810\n>> Or hook her up with IT Pro TV.\n\n2023\n01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:18,320\nSo.\n\n2024\n01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,960\n>> There you go.\nMother's day.\n\n2025\n01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,700\n>> Yes.\n\n2026\n01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,760\nExactly.\nWhen is that coming up?\n\n2027\n01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,380\nI got a little while.\n\n2028\n01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:23,510\nMaybe Christmas.\n\n2029\n01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:24,950\nChristmas.\n>> There we go.\n\n2030\n01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:27,410\n>> All right so,\nI've got my auditing entry here and\n\n2031\n01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:30,530\nagain I can add if I had additional\nauditing entries if we needed to.\n\n2032\n01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:35,560\n>> And real quick and since you're\nassigning to it the principle it doesn't\n\n2033\n01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:39,190\nhave to be a particular user,\nit can be a group.\n\n2034\n01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:42,340\nAnd I think when we're\ndiscussing it earlier,\n\n2035\n01:41:42,340 --> 01:41:47,010\nit's just anything that you can assign or\nthat has permissions assigned to it.\n\n2036\n01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:50,510\n>> Yea a security principle\nis anything that has an SID.\n\n2037\n01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:52,760\nAnything that has a security identifier.\n\n2038\n01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:56,010\nSo anything I can add to\nan access control list.\n\n2039\n01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:57,420\n>> Like a user account.\n\n2040\n01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:00,660\nA computer account,\na group, a service account,\n\n2041\n01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:06,840\nare most of the security principles\nthat we deal with in here.\n\n2042\n01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:07,962\n>> Mm-hm, sweet.\n\n2043\n01:42:07,962 --> 01:42:10,260\n>> All right so I've got that all set-up,\n\n2044\n01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:16,510\nwe will click OK to apply that\n>> And we'll click OK on those properties.\n\n2045\n01:42:16,510 --> 01:42:19,840\nAnd since we're auditing everyone\nI don't need to log off and\n\n2046\n01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:24,490\ntry to do a different account and\nhose up our screen sharing here.\n\n2047\n01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:28,880\nSo now I'm just going to, let's do this.\n\n2048\n01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:29,910\nLet's, I'm going to show you guys,\n\n2049\n01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:33,780\nyeah I'm going to change it\nup on ya here a little bit.\n\n2050\n01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:36,490\nI'm gonna open up the event log,\nall right?\n\n2051\n01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:38,820\nNow another important thing to know,\n\n2052\n01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:42,260\nall auditing is gonna show\nup under your security log.\n\n2053\n01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:46,070\nSo the security log is where\nthe auditing events are going to go.\n\n2054\n01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,390\nAll right?\n\n2055\n01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:51,040\nAnd I am going to wipe this log file so\n\n2056\n01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:56,370\nwe can just see how many events get\ngenerated when I go in and read that file.\n\n2057\n01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:58,820\nNow this is not a best practice, right?\n\n2058\n01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:00,540\nI am going to come in here and\nclick clear log,\n\n2059\n01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:04,950\nand I am not going to save\nthe contents before clearing.\n\n2060\n01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:06,230\nNot a good practice, right?\n\n2061\n01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:09,150\nWe need to save these log entries for\n\n2062\n01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:14,230\nfuture reference, or whatever, prosecuting\nsomebody if they were to hack in.\n\n2063\n01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:14,960\nNot a good thing to do.\n\n2064\n01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,270\nSo I'm going to clear that event log and\n\n2065\n01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:19,340\nthen we can see that the first\nentry that gets created.\n\n2066\n01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:22,300\nOnce you clear it,\nit immediate generates an event saying,\n\n2067\n01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,870\nsomebody cleared the log file.\n\n2068\n01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:27,380\nCuz as a hacker,\none of my goals is to cover my tracks, and\n\n2069\n01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:31,630\nI wanna wipe that log file, and there's\ngonna be evidence that somebody wiped it.\n\n2070\n01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:34,116\nBut anyway, that's another class.\n\n2071\n01:43:34,116 --> 01:43:36,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll hit that It's another episode\n\n2072\n01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:40,260\nthat we'll do in our security track\nwe'll cover that in an episode.\n\n2073\n01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,190\nSo let's do this.\n\n2074\n01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,350\nSo now there's only one entry in here.\n\n2075\n01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:47,080\nI'm going to bring that down for a second.\n\n2076\n01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,130\nGoing to double click on this folder.\n\n2077\n01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:51,750\nOr out there in the middle\nof the desktop [LAUGH].\n\n2078\n01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,130\nAnd then I'm going to click on game codes.\n\n2079\n01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:56,420\n>> Let's add a new code.\n\n2080\n01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:57,630\n>> Yeah, let's add a new code.\n\n2081\n01:43:57,630 --> 01:44:01,889\n>> So, Super Mario and\nthe code for that will be,\n\n2082\n01:44:01,889 --> 01:44:06,600\nwe'll just say, down on white,\nget the whistle.\n\n2083\n01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:10,050\n>> Down on white.\n\n2084\n01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:11,730\n>> I guess I could've\npicked something shorter.\n\n2085\n01:44:11,730 --> 01:44:12,570\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n2086\n01:44:12,570 --> 01:44:14,060\nWants to test my typing skills.\n\n2087\n01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:16,511\nGet the whistle.\n\n2088\n01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:19,737\nThat's good.\n\n2089\n01:44:19,737 --> 01:44:24,430\n>> Then we can find out whoever wrote it\nin there, and be like, hey, whistle user!\n\n2090\n01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:26,600\n>> All right, there we go.\nSo then, I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n2091\n01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:27,910\nsave this guy.\n\n2092\n01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:29,170\nAnd close it.\n\n2093\n01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:33,350\nAnd then we're gonna flip back\nover to the event viewer.\n\n2094\n01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,820\nAnd now the log files don't refresh.\n\n2095\n01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:40,222\nIf you've got it open, it doesn't refresh\nautomatically, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n2096\n01:44:40,222 --> 01:44:41,624\nrefresh the security log.\n\n2097\n01:44:41,624 --> 01:44:43,920\nAnd, yes.\n\n2098\n01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,680\nYou thought I was kidding when I said\nthat these guys generate a lot of events.\n\n2099\n01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:53,270\nNow not all of those are from me, but\nall of them, let's see if we can find some\n\n2100\n01:44:53,270 --> 01:45:00,150\nhere, I'm just going to take a peek at\nthat, that's actually from something else.\n\n2101\n01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,450\n>> Looks like\nthe Windows Filtering Platform that's up.\n\n2102\n01:45:03,450 --> 01:45:06,410\n>> Yeah, and it's having trouble\ndoing something with that store.\n\n2103\n01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:10,050\nThat might be that darn\naccount we created for Wes.\n\n2104\n01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:13,670\nWe did success and failures, so\nhere is my file system events for success.\n\n2105\n01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:19,990\nAnd here I can see, that's where I\nactually close the file, maybe, maybe not.\n\n2106\n01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:25,921\n>> I believe it's 4663, for the event ID.\n\n2107\n01:45:25,921 --> 01:45:27,746\n>> Yeah, that's Windows Defender,\n4663., let's.\n\n2108\n01:45:27,746 --> 01:45:28,410\nOh, there we go.\n\n2109\n01:45:30,030 --> 01:45:31,930\nSo, here's 4663.\n\n2110\n01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:32,789\n>> Nice.\n\n2111\n01:45:32,789 --> 01:45:35,485\n>> And I can see an attempt\nwas made to access an object.\n\n2112\n01:45:35,485 --> 01:45:37,457\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2113\n01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:41,893\n>> And there's the game code's\nfile that I tried to access.\n\n2114\n01:45:41,893 --> 01:45:42,773\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2115\n01:45:42,773 --> 01:45:47,373\nAnd, yeah, well that's my auditing entry.\n\n2116\n01:45:47,373 --> 01:45:52,603\n>> And yeah, and so down there, right,\nit does show what computer it was done on.\n\n2117\n01:45:52,603 --> 01:45:57,580\nPerhaps if it's stored somewhere else,\nright,\n\n2118\n01:45:57,580 --> 01:46:02,610\nso we know that's on this computer,\nthat's where it was generated.\n\n2119\n01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:06,040\nMaybe if it's a kiosk computer\npopping up all the time,\n\n2120\n01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:10,370\nwe would know we need\ntighter security on that.\n\n2121\n01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:12,040\nJust kind of a neat little thing.\n\n2122\n01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,980\n>> Exactly, and again,\n\n2123\n01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:18,710\nwe will talk in some of the later episodes\nabout some of the auditing entries.\n\n2124\n01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:22,528\nThe new categories are gonna\ngive you a lot more information.\n\n2125\n01:46:22,528 --> 01:46:26,642\nBut here is, I'm finding the one\nthat's showing me, that's close,\n\n2126\n01:46:26,642 --> 01:46:28,641\nthat's not the right one either.\n\n2127\n01:46:28,641 --> 01:46:31,980\nIf I can find it, now there's another 663.\n\n2128\n01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:36,370\nThere's another, so\nalready I've found three different\n\n2129\n01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:40,065\nentries that had to do\nwith this gamecodes.txt.\n\n2130\n01:46:40,065 --> 01:46:42,643\nAnd again,\nyou can imagine if you've got hundreds or\n\n2131\n01:46:42,643 --> 01:46:45,393\nthousands of users accessing\nthis file on a daily basis,\n\n2132\n01:46:45,393 --> 01:46:49,080\nhow many entries you could end up\ngenerating, if you're not careful, so.\n\n2133\n01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:53,636\nThis particular category,\nit's one of the older categories,\n\n2134\n01:46:53,636 --> 01:46:55,880\nit does not give me a lot of information,\ndid it?\n\n2135\n01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,121\nDoesn't tell me what's changed.\n\n2136\n01:46:57,121 --> 01:47:00,220\nAnd in fact, in none of these have I seen,\nwho made the change.\n\n2137\n01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:03,576\nI can see that it was coming\nfrom this particular machine.\n\n2138\n01:47:03,576 --> 01:47:07,380\nOops, there we do,\nthat one does show me the user names.\n\n2139\n01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,510\nSome of the newer categories,\nyou can get a lot more information, and\n\n2140\n01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:14,180\nyou can start to see what is being\nchanged and things like that.\n\n2141\n01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:15,480\nBut that's pretty much auditing.\n\n2142\n01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,620\nYeah, it's-\n>> Object access auditing.\n\n2143\n01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:18,710\n>> Yes, object access.\n\n2144\n01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:21,140\nMany different categories we can do.\n\n2145\n01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:22,730\nWhen you've got sensitive files then,\n\n2146\n01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:25,480\nwhere you've got to know\nwho's been making changes.\n\n2147\n01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,530\nCould be industry regulations, could\nbe governmental regulations that say,\n\n2148\n01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:31,185\nyou've got to track who\nmakes changes to this.\n\n2149\n01:47:31,185 --> 01:47:32,927\nHIPAA regulations that say,\n\n2150\n01:47:32,927 --> 01:47:37,115\neverybody that makes a change to\nthis document, has to be documented.\n\n2151\n01:47:37,115 --> 01:47:38,647\nIf that's not redundant there.\n\n2152\n01:47:38,647 --> 01:47:39,807\n>> [LAUGH] I like it, though.\n\n2153\n01:47:39,807 --> 01:47:44,220\nSo, yeah, that's how you set\nup the object access auditing.\n\n2154\n01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:46,710\n>> Sweet, well Mike,\n\n2155\n01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:51,970\nI think that kind of brings us to the end\nof what we set out to do earlier today,\n\n2156\n01:47:51,970 --> 01:47:58,820\nfor this little bit on our official\nconfigure file and folder access.\n\n2157\n01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:00,320\n>> I think we covered all the topics.\n\n2158\n01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:05,351\nI don't remember exactly what\nobjective number this was,\n\n2159\n01:48:05,351 --> 01:48:11,098\nbut we've covered everything in\nthat particular objective, so.\n\n2160\n01:48:11,098 --> 01:48:14,900\nGreat episode, it's good being here\nwith you Nate, as always, lot's of fun.\n\n2161\n01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:15,700\n>> It was a lot of fun.\n\n2162\n01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:19,340\n>> Yeah, I hope you guys out there enjoyed\nit, remember to check us out on itpro.tv,\n\n2163\n01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:24,190\nand if you've

We'll do it again next time.\n\n2171\n01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:42,523\n>> Yep.\n\n2172\n01:48:42,523 --> 01:48:44,195\nAll right, until then.\n\n2173\n01:48:44,195 --> 01:48:54,195\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Rodrick and\nI'm here with my good buddy Nate.\n\n4\n00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,220\n>> Howdy.\n\n5\n00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,270\n>> And we are gonna do an episode on\nconfiguring local security settings.\n\n6\n00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,285\nFun stuff, right?\n\n7\n00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:48,050\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n8\n00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,990\n>> I know right, so sit back, relax,\nand learn without even knowing it.\n\n9\n00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,400\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's nice.\n\n10\n00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,080\n>> All right, let's get right into it.\n\n11\n00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,500\nNate, we got a really good show for\nyou guys today, we are gonna, again,\n\n12\n00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,290\nas we said,\ntalk about local security settings.\n\n13\n00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,430\nWe're gonna take a look at configuring\nour local security policy, the UAC, or\n\n14\n00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,480\nour user account control,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n15\n00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,980\nWhat, secure boot?\n\n16\n00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,480\n>> Yeah, secure boot, right.\n\n17\n00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,810\nThat yep, that's pretty neat.\n\n18\n00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,210\nAnd round everything up with\nthe SmartScreen Filter.\n\n19\n00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,564\nSmartScreen Filter, it screens smartly.\n\n20\n00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:25,755\n>> Better than a dumb screen.\n\n21\n00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:26,320\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n22\n00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,325\n>> I would say, so.\n\n23\n00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:30,300\n[LAUGH] All right, very good, very good.\n\n24\n00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,100\nSo let's get right into it then.\n\n25\n00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,910\nConfiguring our local security policy.\n\n26\n00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,520\nSo before we can dive into\nthat local security policy,\n\n27\n00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,110\nwe really kinda need to understand\nwhat a group policy is.\n\n28\n00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,790\nRight?\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n29\n00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,180\n>> So let's take a minute and\nwe'll go over that.\n\n30\n00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,580\nAnd group policy is something\nthat we'll cover really heavy\n\n31\n00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,800\nwhen we get into our\nActive Directory episodes.\n\n32\n00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,080\nBut when we're working\nwith that local computer,\n\n33\n00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,420\nwe do have a local group policy\nthat works on that machine.\n\n34\n00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,401\nBut as we'll learn, we have our\n\n35\n00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:09,170\nlocal policy,\nwhich affects just that one machine.\n\n36\n00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,820\nAll right.\nSo\n\n37\n00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,810\nevery Windows machine out\nthere has a local policy.\n\n38\n00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,180\n>> And by policy you mean like settings,\nconfigurations?\n\n39\n00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> Things and policies like little\n\n40\n00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,560\nrules or sets to make\nconfiguration changes or stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,880\n>> It is.\nIt's just a collection of\n\n42\n00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,330\nall the different\nsettings that you can do.\n\n43\n00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,050\nIf you think about all the options that\nyou can set on your computer, your\n\n44\n00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,700\nscreensaver timeout, your password protect\nthe screensaver, your password policies.\n\n45\n00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,850\nI mean, there are literally\nthousands of settings in there.\n\n46\n00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,840\n>> Your desktop background.\n\n47\n00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,686\n>> Your desktop background.\n\n48\n00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,887\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's actually a more difficult one than\n\n49\n00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:49,938\nyou might think to do\nthrough group policy.\n\n50\n00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:52,040\nBut yeah, there's all those settings.\n\n51\n00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,120\nAnd when we're working with a machine,\nI can configure those settings manually.\n\n52\n00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,692\nRight?\nI can go to that machine and\n\n53\n00:02:56,692 --> 00:03:00,625\nI can right-click on the background and\nI can pull up my personalization and\n\n54\n00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,483\nI can set the screen saver timeout.\n\n55\n00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:07,105\nBut by using a policy we can start\nmaking sure that those settings\n\n56\n00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:09,690\nare applied consistently.\n\n57\n00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,981\nAnd we'll talk about in a domain\nenvironment we want to try and\n\n58\n00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:17,048\ndo that from a central location where\nI don't have to to touch each machine.\n\n59\n00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:21,110\nBut with our local policy,\nwe still use them.\n\n60\n00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,660\nAnd usually, one of the first\nquestions we get from people is, well,\n\n61\n00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,580\nif we're going to use domain based\npolicies, in a corporate environment when\n\n62\n00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,720\nwe're running Active Directory,\nwe can use a domain based policy.\n\n63\n00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,310\nAnd I can apply settings to all of the\nmachines on my network from one location.\n\n64\n00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,042\nSo why the heck would I ever go to a local\nmachine and set the policy on there?\n\n65\n00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:46,530\n>> Yeah,\nwell in case you're not in a domain?\n\n66\n00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,390\n>> Yeah, exactly.\nA little workgroup settings-\n\n67\n00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,261\n>> A little soho,\n\n68\n00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,755\na little small office that's\nnot running Active Directory.\n\n69\n00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:57,310\n>> Yeah, or a one off kiosk computer.\n\n70\n00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,460\n>> Exactly.\n\n71\n00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,680\n>> Things of that sort, right?\n\n72\n00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,020\n>> Yeah, because you've got machines.\n\n73\n00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,710\nAnd sometimes with group policies,\nwhile they're great for\n\n74\n00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,430\napplying settings to many\nmachines at one time.\n\n75\n00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,950\nTrying to filter it down so those settings\nonly affect and individual machine,\n\n76\n00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,100\ncan be more challenging than\njust going to the machine and\n\n77\n00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,110\nsetting the local policy on that machine.\n\n78\n00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,270\nSo that kiosk machine, that one conference\nroom machine that needs different settings\n\n79\n00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,460\nthan any other machine on your network.\n\n80\n00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,935\nThose are the kinda machines where we\nmight still use that local policy.\n\n81\n00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:32,583\nSo it is still used and it there.\n\n82\n00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:38,389\n>> With these local policies\nbeing set to all sorts of things,\n\n83\n00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:44,120\ncomputer configurations and\nsettings and things.\n\n84\n00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,480\nYou can even use it to roll\nout applications, right?\n\n85\n00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,720\n>> Yeah, powerful stuff.\n\n86\n00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,200\n>> Enforce, yeah, enforce settings.\n\n87\n00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,680\nOr to create this standardized setting,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,672\nOf all your computers and-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n89\n00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,534\nAbsolutely.\n\n90\n00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:02,736\n>> Yep and,\n>> With our local policies, now, prior to,\n\n91\n00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:06,070\nI'd say Windows Vista, but\nthat was the one we kinda forget about,\n\n92\n00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,370\nthat we never talk about.\n\n93\n00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,811\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So really, just say,\n\n94\n00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:10,330\nWindows 7 and later.\n\n95\n00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,215\nPrior to Windows Vista, with XP and\nearlier, you have single, local GPO.\n\n96\n00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:20,350\nThat can be used to apply\nsettings to that machine.\n\n97\n00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,590\nNew, with Windows Vista, Windows 7, and\n\n98\n00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,160\nWindows 8,\nwe have multiple local GPOs now.\n\n99\n00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,130\nWe have three new ones, I guess.\n\n100\n00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,340\nWe've still have our standard local GPO,\n\n101\n00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,280\nthen we have the administrator's GPO,\nthat's only gonna affect you if you\n\n102\n00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,890\nlog into that computer with an account\nthat's in the administrator's group.\n\n103\n00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,580\nWe have a non administrators GPO, that's\ngoing to affect you if you log into that\n\n104\n00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,750\nmachine with an account that's not\nin that administrator's group.\n\n105\n00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,760\nAnd we have a user specific GPO that we\ncan use to apply to an individual user.\n\n106\n00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,810\nIf I've got a setting that just\nneeds to apply when this one person\n\n107\n00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,720\nlogs on to that machine.\n\n108\n00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,150\nWe can use that.\n\n109\n00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,430\nAs long as they've had the, they do\nhave to have a profile in the machine.\n\n110\n00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,290\nSo they have to have logged\nonto that machine at least once\n\n111\n00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,850\nin order to create that user specific GPO.\n\n112\n00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,060\n>> It's like interns right?\n\n113\n00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,680\nOr something like that,\nhe's going to get that one off policy.\n\n114\n00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,435\n>> Like mouse trails are always on.\n\n116\n00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:23,080\nYou cannot turn that off.\n\n117\n00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,990\n>> Wouldn't that be nice?\n\n118\n00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,648\nWe should do that to Jason over there.\n\n119\n00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:28,670\nIt would be\n>> Yeah.\n\n120\n00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,300\n>> My director is giving me a hand signal,\nand I'm not sure what that one means.\n\n121\n00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,778\n>> Yes, the administrator and\n\n122\n00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:41,140\nnon-administrator,those are kinda\ngrouped into their own little level.\n\n123\n00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,140\nSo of the three levels, local security\nsettings are your regular ones and\n\n124\n00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,220\nthen administrator and\nnon-administrator and then user pacfic.\n\n125\n00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,710\n>> A user specific one or\npacific one or yeah, exactly.\n\n126\n00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,510\n>> Oh, Pacific?\n\n127\n00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,052\nWhich one is that?\n\n128\n00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:57,770\n>> Pacific?\nIt's like an ocean.\n\n129\n00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,970\nYeah, so with the administrators or\nthe non-administrators, it's either one or\n\n130\n00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,560\nthe other, right?\n\n131\n00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,110\nYou could not log into a machine\nwith an account that was both in\n\n132\n00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,900\nthe administrator's group and at the same\ntime not in the administrator's group.\n\n133\n00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,570\nSo one or the other is going to be\napplying to you when you log in.\n\n134\n00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,160\nYou couldn't have both of them.\n\n135\n00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,390\nSo in the end, when you log into\na local machine, there could be up to\n\n136\n00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,260\nthree policies being applied to your\ncomputer and your user settings.\n\n137\n00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,800\nThe local GPO, which is always applied.\n\n138\n00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,740\nNo matter if you log on\nwith a local account,\n\n139\n00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,370\nif you log on with a domain account, the\nlocal group policy is always in effect.\n\n140\n00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,420\nAnd then either the administrators or\n\n141\n00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,850\nthe non-administrators, depending on\nwhat type of account you log on as.\n\n142\n00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,280\nAnd then potentially,\nif somebody has configured one,\n\n143\n00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,430\nthere could be a user specific GPO for\nthe user that you're logging on as.\n\n144\n00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,230\n>> GPO, Group Policy Object.\n\n145\n00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,300\n>> GPO, Group Policy Object.\n\n146\n00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,305\nSorry if I didn't define that one.\n\n147\n00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:52,060\n>> Oh no, you use big words.\n\n148\n00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,140\n>> I know, I do like those.\n\n149\n00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,896\nIt makes me feel smarter, something.\n\n150\n00:07:54,896 --> 00:08:01,560\nAll right what do you say we take a look\nat, let's start with a local GPO.\n\n151\n00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,820\nSounds like a good place to start, right?\n\n152\n00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,042\n>> Yeah, local group policy\neditor If I can get number\n\n153\n00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:12,536\non pulled up on IBGA there,\nwe take a peek and\n\n154\n00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:18,660\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm just\ngonna type in GPedit.msc.\n\n155\n00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,590\n>> I thought you were gonna do a custom.\n\n156\n00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,220\nIs that.\nI thought you were gonna say that\n\n157\n00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,320\nfrom yesterday.\n\n158\n00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,688\nYou say, I only use The snap\n>> Well, in my domain environment.\n\n159\n00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:33,310\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] If I was gonna use this every\n\n160\n00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,050\nday, absolutely I would make one put it on\nmy desktop and I would have that available\n\n161\n00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,180\nbut for here for now in this particular\n>> Say that.\n\n162\n00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,030\nAll right.\n\n163\n00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,630\nSo one of the first things I want you guys\nto notice when we take a look at this\n\n164\n00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,300\nlocal gpo or local group policy object.\n\n165\n00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,750\nI typed in again gpedit.msc,\n\n166\n00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,040\nmike sierra charlie, and it launched\nthis local group policy editor.\n\n167\n00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440\nAnd what you'll see is you've\ngot two sections over here.\n\n168\n00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,690\nI've got my Computer Configuration,\n\n169\n00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,570\nwhich has settings that I can use that\nare gonna be applied to that compute.\n\n170\n00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,640\nAnd then I've got my\nUser Configuration portion,\n\n171\n00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,010\nwhere I've got settings that are gonna\naffect whatever user is logging on.\n\n172\n00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,850\nSo we got two different sections in there.\n\n173\n00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,340\nWhich is going to be\ndifferent from the others and\n\n174\n00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,850\nwe'll see that when we take\na look at those other policies.\n\n175\n00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,030\n>> So then the computer configuration,\nright so that's for the computer.\n\n176\n00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,380\nSo regardless of who logs\nin it's the computer.\n\n177\n00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,260\nSo this machine, these policies or\nthese configurations or rules that we'll\n\n178\n00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,640\ntake a look at will be enforced on\nthe computer whenever it turns on.\n\n179\n00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,330\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n180\n00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,220\nSo these will be in effect no matter\nwhat user logs onto that machine.\n\n181\n00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,670\nAnd these are settings that\napply against the computer.\n\n182\n00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,150\nAnd there's a few that we should\nprobably know where they are.\n\n183\n00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,090\nAll right.\n\n184\n00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,410\nAlthough we want to,\nlet's just explore for a second.\n\n185\n00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,470\nWe have our computer configuration and\nour user configuration, and\n\n186\n00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,230\nthey look similar, right?\n\n187\n00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,890\nI've got software,\n\n188\n00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,580\nWindows, and administrative templates\nunder computer as well as under user.\n\n189\n00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,210\nSo, first thing, be careful.\n\n190\n00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,320\nMany times you go to configure a setting\nand there is some duplication.\n\n191\n00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,190\nThere are some settings that you can\ndo to a computer as well as to a user.\n\n192\n00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,800\nSo you end up in the wrong section and\n\n193\n00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,900\nyou're wondering why this isn't working\nbecause you're in the wrong area there.\n\n194\n00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,780\nBut if I expand out, let's take a look.\n\n195\n00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,280\nWe'll save our Windows settings for\nwhen we get into our sec bowl which is\n\n196\n00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,440\nI won't define just yet\nanother one of those big terms.\n\n197\n00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,080\nWe'll save that.\n\n198\n00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,930\nI'm just gonna expand out\nadministrative templates.\n\n199\n00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,010\nLet's just take a peek in here.\n\n200\n00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,140\nYou can go into control panel and\nthen personalization, and\n\n201\n00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,730\nprevent changing the lock screen or\nprevent/enable lock screen camera.\n\n202\n00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,650\nI mean, you guys should explore in here.\n\n203\n00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,970\nThey're on the exam.\n\n204\n00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,010\nThey're not gonna test you on\nevery single option in here.\n\n205\n00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,940\nThere's too many settings.\n\n206\n00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,960\nThere's well over a couple\nthousand settings in here, so\n\n207\n00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,320\nyou don't have to know where\nevery one of these things are.\n\n208\n00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,330\nBut explore.\n\n209\n00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,720\nGo in here and poke around and\n\n210\n00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,295\nsee all of the things that you can do\nto a machine using that local policy.\n\n211\n00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:03,095\nYou can go down to all settings down\nhere under administrative templates.\n\n212\n00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:08,820\nAnd you'll see that in this section alone,\nthere is 19,069 settings there.\n\n213\n00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,320\n>> Wow.\n\n214\n00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,210\n>> So yeah.\n\n215\n00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,488\nJust about anything that you can think of\nyou can configure through your policy.\n\n216\n00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:15,921\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n217\n00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:16,641\nHuh.\n\n218\n00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:17,600\nNice.\n\n219\n00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,190\n>> Yeah.\nSo\n\n220\n00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,410\nthat's a quick peek at\nthe local policy there.\n\n221\n00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,570\nAnd again.\n\n222\n00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,150\nExplore.\n\n223\n00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,470\nSpend some time in there.\n\n224\n00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,370\nAnd see what you can do\nwith that local policy.\n\n225\n00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,425\n>> Now, you did mention that some settings\ncan conflict with each other, right?\n\n226\n00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:35,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n227\n00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,315\nthere is a thing called\na last writer wins, right?\n\n228\n00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,108\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n229\n00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:41,160\n>> So these.\n\n230\n00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,820\nPolicies, right?\n\n231\n00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,390\nSo these little configuration rule sets,\n\n232\n00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,140\nas they are being applied,\nthere's an order.\n\n233\n00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:55,040\nAnd if like, the very first policy says,\nyou cannot change your desktop background.\n\n234\n00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,640\nAnd then the administrator is on and\nthat one rolls out.\n\n235\n00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,650\nAnd let's say on a use specific one,\nthat I assign to myself.\n\n236\n00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,440\nSo I can change it.\n\n237\n00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,500\nIt says you can change desktop background,\nright?\n\n238\n00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,740\n>> Right.\n>> And, it conflicts with an earlier one,\n\n239\n00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,380\nbut because it's the last writer wins and\nthe last policy that\n\n240\n00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,160\napplies is like the trump card\n>> Yeah, and\n\n241\n00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,080\nthat's a very important part of group\npolicy, is learning the order that these\n\n242\n00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,090\n>> Policies are applied in, right?\n\n243\n00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,100\nBecause as Nate points out,\nit is the last one that wins.\n\n244\n00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,410\nSo if you've got two policies\nthat have different settings,\n\n245\n00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,170\nthat last one to apply is\ngonna be the one that wins.\n\n246\n00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,280\nAnd when we're looking at our\norder of policies it's local,\n\n247\n00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:44,050\nlocal policies get applied first, and\nthen any policies linked at the site.\n\n248\n00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,350\nAnd then the domain, and\nthen the organization again.\n\n249\n00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,670\nNow some of those we haven't done our,\n\n250\n00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,660\nyou might not have seen the episodes\nwhere we cover active directories, so\n\n251\n00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,070\nyou might not be familiar with what a site\nis, what a domain is just Just yet.\n\n252\n00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,684\nBut don't worry.\nWe will definitely cover that in\n\n253\n00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:58,820\nother episodes.\n\n254\n00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,850\nRight now we're just focused on the local\nsettings in our Windows 8 episodes here.\n\n255\n00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,370\n>> But, sorry, so like yeah domain right.\n\n256\n00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,510\nSo your computer is part of a domain with\nmost businesses, corporations, what not.\n\n257\n00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,080\nSo the local policy applies first and\n\n258\n00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,990\nthen all the domain stuff is\ngonna trump all that local stuff.\n\n259\n00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,600\n>> Absolutely.\n\n260\n00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,660\nBecause I wouldn't want a user,\n\n261\n00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,440\nan end user, configuring their local\npolicy to override settings that\n\n262\n00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,060\nmy corporate security policy is\nsupposed to be applying right.\n\n263\n00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,690\nSo that way, by applying that local policy\nfirst, it has a chance to take effect.\n\n264\n00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,430\nBut if there's anything that's being done\nat the domain level that's different from\n\n265\n00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,080\nwhat you've done with the local policy,\nthe domain based policies will win.\n\n266\n00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,740\nAbsolutely right.\n\n267\n00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,430\nAnd then we've got to think about too,\nwith the local policies,\n\n268\n00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,490\nthere's now, again three different\npolicies that could be applying, so\n\n269\n00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,690\nwe're going to need to\nknow the order of those.\n\n270\n00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,970\nAnd that's gonna be the local\nGPO's gonna apply first and\n\n271\n00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,830\nthen either the administrator or\n\n272\n00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,290\nthe non-administrator policy depending\non which one you're logging on with.\n\n273\n00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,300\nAnd then if there is one\nthat user specific GPO.\n\n274\n00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:11,355\nWhich we're gonna, again,\nwe'll test that out on Jason later.\n\n275\n00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:12,145\n>> We really should.\n\n276\n00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:12,925\n>> Yeah, we should.\n\n277\n00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:14,755\nLet's see what he notices\nwhat's going on there.\n\n278\n00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:21,680\nYou know he does have this kind of\na fetish for the My Pretty Ponies thing?\n\n279\n00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,580\nWell I've seen that.\n\n280\n00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,910\nI've seen that.\n>> We could maybe set his background for\n\n281\n00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,153\nhim or something like that.\n\n282\n00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:29,620\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think he would really like that.\n\n283\n00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,520\nWe should do that.\n\n284\n00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,800\nMaybe a custom mouse\npointer that's like a pony?\n\n285\n00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,370\n>> Oh, he would love that.\n\n286\n00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,490\nAbout that.\n\n287\n00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,690\n>> So anyhow.\n>> We'll do that maybe on our break and\n\n288\n00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,242\nsee if we can get some\nreaction out of him.\n\n289\n00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:43,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n290\n00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,020\nwe've got the local group policy\nthat we've taken a peek at,\n\n291\n00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,660\nand again, notice that it\ndoes have a computer portion.\n\n292\n00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,840\nAnd a user portion,\nnow we want to take a peek at the others?\n\n293\n00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,180\nShould we take a look at those guys,\n\n294\n00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,240\nbecause there is an important\ndifference that I want to point out.\n\n295\n00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,640\nJust for Nate I think I will make\na custom MMC and we'll show you guys,\n\n296\n00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,350\nit's really the only way you\ncan work with them anyways.\n\n297\n00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,270\nSo if you can pull me up again over\nthere Meistro I am going to create\n\n298\n00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,405\nan MMC or Mike Mike Charlie for\nMicrosoft management console.\n\n299\n00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:19,337\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, very good.\nAnd we are going- oops evidently I wasn't\n\n300\n00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:24,150\npaying attention and launched the hyperV\nmanager so let's try that one more time.\n\n301\n00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,370\nSo it's interesting how you\ncan type in mmc and yet\n\n302\n00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,010\nHyper V Manager is\nthe first one in the list.\n\n303\n00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,990\nAnd we wonder why Bing is not\neverybody's search engine of choice.\n\n304\n00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,290\n>> Bing wins the Bing challenge.\n\n305\n00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,290\n>> Yeah.\nI think they could use Google to search.\n\n306\n00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:43,910\n>> Oh.\n>> Yeah.\n\n307\n00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,730\nI didn't say that, did i?\n\n308\n00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,350\nSo there we go.\n\n309\n00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,259\nThere's my custom console, and\n\n310\n00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:52,291\nI think we covered these really\nheavily in one of our server episodes.\n\n311\n00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,442\nSo maybe not too much time here, but\n\n312\n00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:59,248\nit is just a custom console that starts\nout as a blank console with nothing in it,\n\n313\n00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:03,291\nand we can choose to add what we\ncall snap ins to add functionality.\n\n314\n00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,600\nSo I click on Add Remove snap in.\n\n315\n00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,215\nAnd I'm gonna find my\nGroup Policy Object Editor snap-in.\n\n316\n00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:11,920\nAll right.\n\n317\n00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,540\nAnd I'll click Add and\n\n318\n00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,060\nwhen I do it's gonna ask me well what\nGroup policy do you want to modify?\n\n319\n00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,420\nAnd I'll go ahead and add them all.\n\n320\n00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,340\nWe're gonna add the local computer, so\n\n321\n00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,620\nthat'd be the local GPO that we've\nbeen talking about right now.\n\n322\n00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,150\n>> And I will click Finish.\n\n323\n00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,050\n>> Okay.\n\n324\n00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,752\n>> But then I'm gonna turn around and\nadd the same snap-in a second time.\n\n325\n00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:36,074\nAnd this time I'm gonna click Browse\ninstead of doing the local computer policy\n\n326\n00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:38,040\nI'm going to click Browse.\n\n327\n00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,040\nAnd I'm going to go to this users tab and\nI'm gonna find the Administrators.\n\n328\n00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,720\nMake sure you're looking closely\nthere because I've got a built in\n\n329\n00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,120\nadministrator account.\n\n330\n00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,750\nSo this would be one that was\nspecific to that built in account.\n\n331\n00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,620\nThis is the one for\n\n332\n00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,620\nthe administrators group that we're\ntalking about in this episode.\n\n333\n00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,620\nAll right.\nSo\n\n334\n00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,110\nnow local computer administrators,\nthen I'm gonna add it a third time.\n\n335\n00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,140\nGetting a little tedious and\nI'll go right back into Users and\n\n336\n00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,730\nthen I'm gonna do the Non Administrators\nand then one more time, why not?\n\n337\n00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,930\n>> I bet you're gonna pick\njust a user this time.\n\n338\n00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,340\n>> Yeah, you're so smart.\n\n339\n00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,520\n>> An individual user.\n\n340\n00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,930\n>> Wow.\nhe is like psychic.\n\n341\n00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,600\nI'm gonna wear my tinfoil hat tomorrow.\n\n342\n00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,300\n>> So yeah, you can see the different\n[LAUGH] user accounts that\n\n343\n00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,420\nexist on this machine.\n\n344\n00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,010\nIf that person had not logged\nonto the machine before,\n\n345\n00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,730\nthen they would not show up in this list,\nand\n\n346\n00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,700\nyou would not be able to create\na GPO specific to that user account.\n\n347\n00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,710\nSo let's see here.\n\n348\n00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,510\nI'll pick Magic Nate.\n\n349\n00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,230\n>> All right, that works.\n\n350\n00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,600\n>> And we'll click OK on that one.\n\n351\n00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,280\nAnd we'll click Finish.\n\n352\n00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:49,000\nAnd so now I've added that same policy,\nwhere did my non-administrator go?.\n\n353\n00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,300\nBefore I added that one in there.\n\n354\n00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,860\nLets try that one more time,\nto make sure that guy gets in there.\n\n355\n00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,580\nI know, it flickered on me a second\nago I might have lost something.\n\n356\n00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,021\nNow I got it in there and\nlets move it up just to make it logical.\n\n357\n00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:07,012\nYeah, also the tendencies.\n\n358\n00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:08,702\n>> No, no, no, I like it though,\nit's all in order.\n\n359\n00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:09,300\n>> Yeah, okay, good.\n\n360\n00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,160\nSo I click OK on that,\n\n361\n00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,000\nand now I've got this tool that has\nall of my local policies in there.\n\n362\n00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,870\nAnd if I was smart, I would save this guy.\n\n363\n00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,530\nMaybe dump it out on my desktop,\n\n364\n00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,150\ncall it Local GPO Editor.\n\n365\n00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,110\nAnd click Save.\n\n366\n00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,750\nSo now in the future if I want to go\nback and work with these policies,\n\n367\n00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,770\nI don't have to go through\nthose tedious policies again.\n\n368\n00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,669\nI can just come over here and\nclick my little tool box.\n\n369\n00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,295\nAnd there's all of my\nbeautiful local GPOs.\n\n370\n00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:46,113\n>> Nice.\n\n371\n00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:46,890\n>> All right.\n\n372\n00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,830\nSo we talked about\nthe local computer policy.\n\n373\n00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,460\nAgain This is the same policy, I'm just\nusing a different console to get to it.\n\n374\n00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,880\nSo there's my computer configuration\nportion and my user configuration portion.\n\n375\n00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,250\nThen we've got the administrator's policy.\n\n376\n00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,600\nAnd what I want you guys to notice,\nsee the difference between that?\n\n377\n00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,160\nWhat's missing from this local computer\n\n378\n00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,420\nadministrator's policy\nthat's in the other one?\n\n379\n00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,040\n>> Ding, ding, ding,\ncomputer configuration.\n\n380\n00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,950\n>> Computer configuration, yeah.\n\n381\n00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,150\nThese two policies both\nthe administrator's and\n\n382\n00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,120\nthe non administrator's\nonly have user settings.\n\n383\n00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,800\nThere are no computer\nbased settings in there.\n\n384\n00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,860\nAs well as the user specific,\nonly user settings, no computer settings.\n\n385\n00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,250\nRemember that one for the exam.\n\n386\n00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,940\nAll right.\nSo no computer settings in those policies.\n\n387\n00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,334\nAnd that again would be the order.\n\n388\n00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,680\nRight?\nLocal first, and then administrators or\n\n389\n00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,210\nnon administrators, and\n\n390\n00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,820\nthen rounding that off with\nthe user specific if there is one.\n\n391\n00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,840\nOther than that,\nI think the settings are the same.\n\n392\n00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,470\nRight?\n\n393\n00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,690\nI mean, if we take a peek, you've got\nyour Windows settings, security set up,\n\n394\n00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,140\nsoftware setting, administrative\ntemplates, same thing down here.\n\n395\n00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,266\nAll right?\n\n396\n00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:51,960\n>> All right.\nOkay,\n\n397\n00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,030\nso with the order how\nthings are rolled out.\n\n398\n00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,090\nIf you created a policy.\n\n399\n00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,658\nRight?\n\n400\n00:19:57,658 --> 00:20:04,050\nA setting, for your administrators, and\nthat was all that you assigned it you.\n\n401\n00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,790\nThen let's say, and I sign on.\n\n402\n00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,450\nRight?\nOn your machine and\n\n403\n00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,135\nI'm not an administrator.\n\n404\n00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:13,270\n>> Right.\n>> So as it goes through older things\n\n405\n00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,790\nthat policy is gonna just skip right over,\nI mean when I sign on.\n\n406\n00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,860\n>> Yep, we could even do a quick\nexample if we wanna try this.\n\n407\n00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,030\n>> Oh, nice.\n\n408\n00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,110\n>> Let's pull you out.\n\n409\n00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,445\nLet me see who I've got here.\n\n410\n00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:30,113\n[SOUND] So what I will do is get\n\n411\n00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:36,528\ninto my computer management.\n\n412\n00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,946\nAnd take a look at some of these accounts\nand see who's in the administrators and\n\n413\n00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:43,220\nnot administrators, I can't remember\nwhat we did for that other episode.\n\n414\n00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,640\nSo for your account for\nexample, you are or\n\n415\n00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,250\nwere are no longer a member of the\nadministrators group as a matter of fact.\n\n416\n00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,860\n>> Oh yeah, that's great.\n\n417\n00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,170\n>> But you're still in awesomeness and\ngreatness.\n\n418\n00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,120\n>> Oh yeah, I remember that.\n\n419\n00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640\n>> Hopefully you guys\nremember that episode.\n\n420\n00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,540\nWe had a lot of fun with that one.\n\n421\n00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,490\n>> Yeah, with the groups and stuff.\n\n422\n00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> That was good.\n\n423\n00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,680\n>> All right, so\nyou are not in the administrators group.\n\n424\n00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,360\nAnd just to verify, I'm gonna pull up the\nadministrators group and take a look and\n\n425\n00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,963\nthe only members are gonna be Ronnie, me,\nand the built in administrator account.\n\n426\n00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:11,182\nAll right.\n\n427\n00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:15,645\nSo, but\nI can't really log off this guy, can I?\n\n428\n00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:16,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> With iVGA.\n\n429\n00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,770\nThat is gonna be a challenge.\n\n430\n00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,400\n>> Maybe not the best way\nto do the demo there.\n\n431\n00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,340\nUnfortunately if I have to log off and\nlog back on, it will kick off iVGA.\n\n432\n00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,250\nWhat we use to share my\nscreen on our shows here.\n\n433\n00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,810\nWe still go through the policy though.\n\n434\n00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,390\nLet's go ahead and set them anyway.\n\n435\n00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,960\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so\n\n436\n00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,690\nwhat I could do, is I can come over\nhere to the administrator's policy.\n\n437\n00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,790\nAnd I could say something like,\nwhat do we want to do for\n\n438\n00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,670\nthe administrator's Start Menu and\nTask Bar.\n\n439\n00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,875\nMaybe something like remove\nthe game's link from the start menu.\n\n440\n00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No way.\n\n441\n00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,600\n>> That's crazy talk.\n\n442\n00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,140\n>> I know.\nRight?\n\n443\n00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,489\n>> That is crazy.\n\n444\n00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:02,990\n>> Although with Windows 8 it's not going\nto do a whole lot without the Start Menu.\n\n445\n00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,100\nRemove Ron, remove music icons, I'm trying\nto think of something we could really-\n\n446\n00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,560\n>> Password policies?\n\n447\n00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,327\n>> Password policies we\nwould set at the local GPO.\n\n448\n00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,780\nI know what we could do.\n\n449\n00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,630\nWhat about prevent.\n\n450\n00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,916\nLet's see, I want to.\n\n451\n00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:29,110\nLet's do a prevent access\nto registry editing tools.\n\n452\n00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,790\nAll right.\n\n453\n00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,650\nSo this is just one of the myriad of\nthousands of settings that are in there.\n\n454\n00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,520\nAnd what I'm gonna do, and\n\n455\n00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,990\nthis brings me to another good point\nthat we probably should mention.\n\n456\n00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,190\nWhile working with these group policies,\n\n457\n00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,645\nyou really have to watch the wording,\ndon't you?\n\n458\n00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:42,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean,\n\n459\n00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,290\nit can get a little twisty on you there.\n\n460\n00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,076\nLike for example, this one,\nprevent access to registry editing tools.\n\n461\n00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,199\nWell, if I enable that\nthen that's going to?\n\n462\n00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:55,180\n>> Stop access to\nthe registry editing tools.\n\n463\n00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,223\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n464\n00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:57,550\nRight?\nJust like the name says,\n\n465\n00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,290\nprevent access to registry editing tools.\n\n466\n00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,890\nSome policies,\nwhen you turn them on like this,\n\n467\n00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,890\nyou get additional options down here.\n\n468\n00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,260\nLike this one does allow me to say,\n\n469\n00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,920\ndo I want it to prevent it from running\nsilently in the background like some other\n\n470\n00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,840\napplication or something trying\nto trigger registry entries.\n\n471\n00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,560\nBut for the administrators I wanna\nmake sure they do have access.\n\n472\n00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,710\nI wanna stop my non-administrators from\ngetting access to registry editing tools,\n\n473\n00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,150\nbut I wanna make sure\nthe administrators do.\n\n474\n00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,580\nSo what I can do is I can disable\nPrevent Access to Registry Editing Tools,\n\n475\n00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,090\nwhich is kinda like\na double negative almost.\n\n476\n00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,990\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH] Like don't not prevent.\n\n477\n00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,260\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n478\n00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,400\nSo this way, if a policy that applied\npreviously had blocked registry editing\n\n479\n00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,830\ntools, when this policy kicks in, it's\ngonna ensure that they do have access.\n\n480\n00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,520\nIt's gonna disable Preventing access.\n\n481\n00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,200\nRight?\n\n482\n00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,960\nAgain, [LAUGH] you have to kind of\nrun that in your mind a couple times\n\n483\n00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,870\nthere and think wait.\n\n484\n00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:59,430\nDisabling prevent access is actually\nenabling access to registry editing tools.\n\n485\n00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:05,101\nAll right, so, we'll disable that for\nmy administrators and we'll click OK.\n\n486\n00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:08,781\nAnd then I can.\n\n487\n00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:13,770\nLet's do another one for\nthe non-administrators maybe.\n\n488\n00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,490\nOr let's do this.\n\n489\n00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,065\nLet's do a user configuration, and\nlet's go in here and do that same setting.\n\n490\n00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:22,280\nCuz this policy would be applying first,\nright?\n\n491\n00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,910\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> In that order.\n\n492\n00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:30,140\nSo in this one, I'm going to\nsort these things, first of all.\n\n493\n00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,250\nAnd then, we're going to prevent\naccess to registry editing tools,\n\n494\n00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,150\nand this time I'm going to enable it.\n\n495\n00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,258\nAnd, I'll leave that on as well,\ndisable it from running silently.\n\n496\n00:24:41,258 --> 00:24:42,580\n>> Any comments?\n\n497\n00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,250\n>> No.\n\n498\n00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,205\n>> I'm just kidding.\n\n499\n00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:46,830\n>> [LAUGH] Should we?\n\n500\n00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,870\nYes.\nAm I?\n\n501\n00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,690\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n502\n00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,870\n>> All right.\n\n503\n00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,760\nAnd then maybe one more for\nthe non-administrators.\n\n504\n00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,650\nLet's say that we want to,\nwhat should we do to them?\n\n505\n00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,360\nMaybe we want to hide\nthe Internet Explorer icon.\n\n506\n00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,180\nThat wouldn't be very nice, would it?\n\n507\n00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,590\nI'm trying to think of a good one\nthat we could show on screen here.\n\n508\n00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:20,640\nHow about something like, prevent\naccess to deleting browser history?\n\n509\n00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,460\nThat's a strange one, right?\n\n510\n00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,750\n>> Yeah, I wouldn't touch that one.\n\n511\n00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,410\n>> Prevent changing desktop background.\n\n512\n00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:26,959\nThere we go.\n\n513\n00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,057\n>> Yeah, that's a good one.\n\n514\n00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:29,860\n>> That one, we can do.\n\n515\n00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,380\nWe'll just turn that one on.\n\n516\n00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,080\nThis one doesn't have\nany additional options,\n\n517\n00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,490\nthere's nothing else to configure to that.\n\n518\n00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,030\nAll right, so that one is now\nconfigured on the non-administrators.\n\n519\n00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,430\nThen I'm gonna go on down here\nto the good old Nate policy.\n\n520\n00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,746\nAnd let's set something like.\n\n521\n00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:55,037\nLet's do a display and actually,\nlet's do personalization and\n\n522\n00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:57,960\npassword protect the screensaver.\n\n523\n00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,798\nAnother we use all the time in\nthe corporate environment cuz it is\n\n524\n00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,352\nan important security feature,\nis to lock the screen, and\n\n525\n00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:09,070\nmake sure that users can't\nchange that particular setting.\n\n526\n00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,370\nSo now we've got, if we stop and\nthink about what we just did,\n\n527\n00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,645\nwe've got our local GPO,\nwhich is gonna apply first.\n\n528\n00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:19,330\nWhich is, should be preventing access\nto registry editing tools, right?\n\n529\n00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:19,940\n>> Yep.\n\n530\n00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,390\n>> Then I've got the administrator's\npolicy that comes second if you log on as\n\n531\n00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:30,540\nan administrator, and it's disabling\nprevent access to registry editing tools.\n\n532\n00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,256\nSo they should have access\nto registry editing tools.\n\n533\n00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:35,140\n>> Yes.\n>> If you log on as a non administrator,\n\n534\n00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,770\nthen the second policy to apply\n\n535\n00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,370\ndoesn't say anything about\nthe registry editing tools.\n\n536\n00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:45,955\nSo that first policy still kicks in, as\nwell as, now I forgot what we did to them.\n\n537\n00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:48,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We prevented changing\n\n538\n00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,860\nthe desktop background.\n\n539\n00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,530\nIs that what it is?\n\n540\n00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,030\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n541\n00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,840\nPrevented changing the desktop background.\n\n542\n00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,895\nAnd then, only if Nate logs on, Nate will\nhave a password protect the screensaver.\n\n543\n00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,544\nAnd if Nate is not in the administrators\ngroup he will also not be able to access\n\n544\n00:27:02,544 --> 00:27:03,746\nregistry editing tools.\n\n545\n00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:05,789\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\n\n546\n00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:10,518\nAnd we started at the top and\nyeah, each setting rolls out and\n\n547\n00:27:10,518 --> 00:27:14,808\napplies all the way down to\nthe very last user setting.\n\n548\n00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:18,260\n>> Yeah, so I tell you what,\nwe're coming up on our break time here,\n\n549\n00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,860\nso why don't we take a quick break.\n\n550\n00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,100\nGive you guys a chance to\ngrab something to drink and\n\n551\n00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,430\nstretch your legs a little bit.\n\n552\n00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,960\nWe come back,\nmaybe we'll look at testing this.\n\n553\n00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,382\nWe'll kick the director over\nthere a couple of times.\n\n554\n00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:28,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n555\n00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,690\nsee if we can't figure out a way\nto switch our screen back and\n\n556\n00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,770\nforth when I'm logging in and logging out.\n\n557\n00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,496\nAnd we'll be back in just a few.\n\n558\n00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:44,665\n[SOUND]\n>> And welcome back.\n\n559\n00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:48,400\nAll right, we left off on security policy.\n\n560\n00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,200\nWe set some policies.\n\n561\n00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,740\n>> We did.\n\n562\n00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,790\n>> Some local security policies.\n\n563\n00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,780\nAnd different ones to\nthe people on the machine.\n\n564\n00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,530\nAnd so now, we're going to\nsign on with that user, and-\n\n565\n00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,120\n>> Let's test it out.\n\n566\n00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,520\n>> Yeah, and we're going to look and see.\n\n567\n00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,300\n>> So if I can get our director to pull up\nwhat am I on, feed number one, I believe.\n\n568\n00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,410\nCurrently I'm logged on with an\nadministrative account, with my account.\n\n569\n00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,310\nAnd all I'm gonna do is switch\nover here and run regedit.\n\n570\n00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,510\nAnd hopefully I get access to it.\n\n571\n00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,655\nSo even though that local GPO says prevent\naccess to registry editing tools, because\n\n572\n00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:29,228\nI have logged on with an administrator\naccount and that policy applies after\n\n573\n00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:34,246\nthe local GPO, then disable prevent access\nto registry edit tools is winning out.\n\n574\n00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:37,900\nLast writer wins and\nI get access to registry editing tools.\n\n575\n00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,098\nSo that works well and good.\n\n576\n00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:43,640\nSo I'm gonna cut out for a second,\ndirector, so we're going to lose my feed.\n\n577\n00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,610\nI'm gonna switch user accounts.\n\n578\n00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,070\n>> And so now, yeah, so\nnow you're gonna sign on as me,\n\n579\n00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,480\nas my account on your machine,\nwhich is a non-administrator.\n\n580\n00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,840\nAnd so the regedit should be blocked,\ncan't change the background,\n\n581\n00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,100\nand password protect the screensaver.\n\n582\n00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,760\n>> Now, let's see.\n\n583\n00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,621\nLet me get the IVG up and\nrunning here first.\n\n584\n00:29:14,996 --> 00:29:17,620\nAnd I'm going to pull\nstream number one again.\n\n585\n00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,200\nLet's see if we are live.\n\n586\n00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,620\nAll right so now I am logged on as Nate,\n\n587\n00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,820\nwho again is not in the administrators\ngroup, so I am gonna try to run regedit.\n\n588\n00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,215\nAnd I get registry editing has been\ndisabled by your administrator.\n\n589\n00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:39,765\n[LAUGH] And so that setting did work.\n\n590\n00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:43,225\nWhat, that's not me,\nthat's your background.\n\n591\n00:29:43,225 --> 00:29:45,370\n[LAUGH]\n>> Let's change it.\n\n592\n00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,157\n[LAUGH] All right, Nate's not a big fan.\n\n593\n00:29:47,157 --> 00:29:48,544\n>> Let's change the background.\n\n594\n00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:51,600\n>> All right, so\nwere gonna change his background for him.\n\n595\n00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,390\n>> Personalize.\n\n596\n00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,040\n>> And, oh no.\n\n597\n00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,870\nThe link is grayed out.\n\n598\n00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,436\nAnd right there on the bottom I can see,\none or more of these setting on this page\n\n599\n00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:04,640\nhas been disabled by your\nsystem administrator.\n\n600\n00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,060\nWhich is what the GPO is doing.\n\n601\n00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,050\nSo it is, in fact, preventing him\nfrom changing his background.\n\n602\n00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,980\nWe saw the message pop up that\nhe's not able to get access\n\n603\n00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,940\nto the registry editing tools.\n\n604\n00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,740\nAs well as if I go over screensaver,\nI'll see that, oh.\n\n605\n00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,710\nAnd maybe I didn't set that one for you.\n\n606\n00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,190\nI can't remember which one I did that on.\n\n607\n00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,381\nBut it is not password protected.\n\n608\n00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:32,790\nAll right, so good example of the three\ndifferent policies there that,\n\n609\n00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,460\nand the way those kick in.\n\n610\n00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,015\nAnd here, I'll pull that down for you.\n\n611\n00:30:36,015 --> 00:30:37,170\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, yeah, yeah.\n\n612\n00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,010\n>> We'll get off of that.\n\n613\n00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,450\n>> Make sure you turn on Fiber G.\n\n614\n00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,610\n>> Gracias senor.\n\n615\n00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:51,160\n>> All right, yeah, so there are few\npolicies in there I think are noteworthy.\n\n616\n00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,632\nThat we'll go over once Mike gets all\n\n617\n00:30:55,632 --> 00:31:00,530\nsigned back in and all that fun stuff.\n\n618\n00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,160\nSo particularly, you know there's,\n\n619\n00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,550\nof all the settings in there,\nthere's a few that we should.\n\n620\n00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,710\n>> There really are.\n\n621\n00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,260\nLike I said at the beginning of the\nepisode, they're not going to ask you to\n\n622\n00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,800\nmemorize every possible setting,\nor anything like that.\n\n623\n00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,050\nBut there's definitely a few that\nyou should be familiar with, and\n\n624\n00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,060\nbe able to get to easily, right?\n\n625\n00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,580\nImportant settings that we\nneed to be able to show.\n\n626\n00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,430\nSo I think I am live again there, Jason.\n\n627\n00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,750\nSo I will pull up that same\nconsole that I built earlier.\n\n628\n00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,230\nAnd I'm going to collapse this up,\nget it out of the way.\n\n629\n00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,160\nGo back in that local policy and\nwhere am I going here?\n\n630\n00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,640\n>> Computer Configuration >\nWindows Settings > Security Settings.\n\n631\n00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,180\n>> There we go.\n\n632\n00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:53,125\n>> All right and yep, and\nin there so there at the top,\n\n633\n00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:58,300\naccount policies,\nright there is password policy.\n\n634\n00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,460\nLet's go and jump into there.\n\n635\n00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,790\nNow in password policies, right,\n\n636\n00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,120\nin some of the domain places,\nenvironments,\n\n637\n00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,791\npassword policies,\nyou'll be running into some of these.\n\n638\n00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,631\nEnforce password history.\n\n639\n00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:20,495\nRight, so the amount of time\nthat has to pass before you're\n\n640\n00:32:20,495 --> 00:32:22,820\nable to reuse a password.\n\n641\n00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,880\n>> Yeah,\nwith that password history in here,\n\n642\n00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,660\nI'll go ahead and double-click on it for\nour viewers out there.\n\n643\n00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,400\nHow many passwords Windows\nis going to remember.\n\n644\n00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,710\nAnd I know this is not our\nsecurity plus episode, so\n\n645\n00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,100\nwe don't want to dive too deep in there,\nso check out security plus.\n\n646\n00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,260\nWe go much more in depth into these,\nand it's a really cool class anyways.\n\n647\n00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,340\nSo there's some good episodes\nthere with security plus.\n\n648\n00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,200\nBut, password history, how many\npasswords Windows is gonna remember.\n\n649\n00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,360\nBecause one of my users' favorite tricks,\n\n650\n00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,230\nwhen I tell them they have to change\ntheir password every 30 days.\n\n651\n00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,990\nThey're gonna flip back and forth between\ntheir two favorite passwords, and\n\n652\n00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,280\njust change it back and\nforth and back and forth.\n\n653\n00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,050\nWell if I tell it's gonna\nremember the last 24 passwords,\n\n654\n00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:05,600\nthen they will be able to reuse that\npassword, if we're changing every 30 days,\n\n655\n00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,500\nit's next two years from now before\nthey can reuse that password.\n\n656\n00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,250\n>> Yep,\nwe have the maximum password age, right?\n\n657\n00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:22,160\nSo how long to time is gonna pass before\nthe users have to change their password.\n\n658\n00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,520\n>> Yeah, how often do we have\nto change that password?\n\n659\n00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,530\nA lot of times we'll set that to 30 days,\nyou know, depending on the environment,\n\n660\n00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,170\nhow secure we need to be.\n\n661\n00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,570\n>> Yep.\n\n662\n00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,010\nMinimum password age, right,\n\n663\n00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,190\na minimum amount of time that\nhas to pass to reuse a password.\n\n664\n00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,710\n>> Yeah.\nAnd it's an interesting one.\n\n665\n00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,410\nIt's one that people usually\nhave a question about.\n\n666\n00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,280\nIt's like wait, why do I care how old?\n\n667\n00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,005\nCuz the first one we did, maximum password\nage, how often I have to change it.\n\n668\n00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:54,175\nMinimum password age, how old it\nhas to be before I can change it.\n\n669\n00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:57,045\nWell, who cares how old it has to be?\n\n670\n00:33:57,045 --> 00:34:01,655\nWell your users who cannot figure\nout how to print a spreadsheet\n\n671\n00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:06,425\nin landscape format, will figure out\nhow to bypass your security files.\n\n672\n00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:08,395\nThis is the most amazing\nthing I've ever seen.\n\n673\n00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:10,675\nThey can barely reboot their machine, yet\n\n674\n00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:13,490\nthey can figure out how to\nbypass my password policy.\n\n675\n00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:18,190\nSo what they're gonna do is if I tell\nit we're gonna remember 24 passwords.\n\n676\n00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:23,880\nThey're gonna change their password\n23 times in a row on Monday morning,\n\n677\n00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,240\njust to get back to\ntheir favorite password.\n\n678\n00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,110\nSo this way, we set that to at least\na one maybe, something like that.\n\n679\n00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,530\nSo now it's gonna be 24 days before you\ncan get back to that favorite password.\n\n680\n00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,530\nAnd then six days later,\n\n681\n00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,930\nyou gotta change it again,\nbecause we're changing it every 30 days.\n\n682\n00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,560\n>> Yep.\n\n683\n00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,094\nMinimum password length, just how many\ncharacters the password needs to be.\n\n684\n00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:50,766\n>> And obviously length is very important\nwhen it comes to password security,\n\n685\n00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:52,376\nthe longer the stronger.\n\n686\n00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:56,248\n8 characters minimum I would think.\n\n687\n00:34:56,248 --> 00:35:02,585\nSo, how long we want to set that.\n\n688\n00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:10,210\n>> Yeah, I was reading on the internet\nof some of these cracking programs.\n\n689\n00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:16,360\nSo, length necessarily isn't really\nthe end all of password security but\n\n690\n00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,550\nit gets on and on.\n\n691\n00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,070\n>> I would argue with you on that one.\n\n692\n00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,440\nWe'd have to go around and round.\n\n693\n00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,656\nSo we'll save that for\nour security episode.\n\n694\n00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:23,612\n>> For the post discussion.\n\n695\n00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:26,010\n>> Yeah, for the post discussion.\n\n696\n00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,726\nBut length is gonna be\nextremely important.\n\n697\n00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,919\nAnd then the other one is gonna be,\n\n698\n00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:33,955\npassword must meet\ncomplexity requirements?\n\n699\n00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:37,160\n>> Right, complexity requirements.\n\n700\n00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,490\nWhether or not you have to use uppercase,\nlowercase letters, and special characters.\n\n701\n00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:48,820\nI mean it can be a really long password,\nbut if it's all in dictionary words,\n\n702\n00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:55,355\nthen whether how secure it is, the thing\nis a little cloudy but, enforcing\n\n703\n00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:59,720\ncomplexity requirements, having to throw\nin numbers, special characters in there.\n\n704\n00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,810\nIt does make a nice strong password.\n\n705\n00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,818\n>> It definitely makes it stronger, cuz\nwhen you look at the way these password\n\n706\n00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:08,967\ncracking tools work, and they're doing\nbrute force attacks, it's all about\n\n707\n00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,636\nthe number of possibilities per character,\nand the length of the password.\n\n708\n00:36:12,636 --> 00:36:14,608\nI don't care what he says.\n\n709\n00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:18,098\nAnd with Windows, what you need to\nknow for the exam, with Windows,\n\n710\n00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:22,025\nwhen we enable this setting, password\nmust meet complexity requirements.\n\n711\n00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:24,688\nThere's four character sets\nthey can use in a password,\n\n712\n00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:28,830\nupper case letters, lower case letters,\nnumbers, and special characters.\n\n713\n00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,570\nIf I turn this feature on,\n\n714\n00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,030\nyour password has to include\nthree of the four character sets.\n\n715\n00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,100\nIt doesn't matter which ones you use.\n\n716\n00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,680\nYou could do upper case, lower case, and\nnumbers, or lower case, numbers, and\n\n717\n00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,760\nspecial character.\n\n718\n00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,980\nAs long as three of the character sets\nare represented in your password, you will\n\n719\n00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,750\nmeet the complexity requirements and\nyou'll be able to choose that password.\n\n720\n00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,276\n>> Let's get down to folder\ninto account lock out policy.\n\n721\n00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,773\n>> All right, want to skip that last one.\n\n722\n00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:57,301\nJust in case, store passwords\nusing reversible encryption,\n\n723\n00:36:57,301 --> 00:37:01,170\nsomething you do not want to turn on,\nunless you absolutely have to.\n\n724\n00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,020\nPasswords are normally stored as a hash,\na one way encryption.\n\n725\n00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,610\nIf I turn this feature on,\nit's stored as a two way encryption.\n\n726\n00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,260\nSomething that can be decrypted.\n\n727\n00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,540\nSome older authentication protocols,\n\n728\n00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,960\nChap might require challenge\nhandshake authentication protocol.\n\n729\n00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,910\nWatch our security episode.\n\n730\n00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,890\nMight require that reversal encryption,\nso we can turn it on here.\n\n731\n00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,827\nWe can also turn it on\na per user basis as well.\n\n732\n00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:28,519\n>> All right,\naccount lock out policy, right?\n\n733\n00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:32,370\nHere's the very first one,\nthey're account lock out duration.\n\n734\n00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:38,510\nSo whenever there is multiple attempts\nat a password at wrong attempts.\n\n735\n00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,680\nIt will lock the account.\n\n736\n00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,300\nAnd the first one there,\nthe account lockout duration.\n\n737\n00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,280\nHow long that the account remains,\nremains locked.\n\n738\n00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,717\n>> Yep, yep.\nIf that account has been locked because of\n\n739\n00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:56,609\ntoo many invalid attempts,\nHow long do you want it to remain locked.\n\n740\n00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:59,350\nDo want it to remain locked for an hour?\n\n741\n00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,960\nDo want it to remain locked for\nhalf a day?\n\n742\n00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,650\nOr you can set it indefinitely, right?\n\n743\n00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,510\nI can say that an administrator has\nto manually unlock the account,\n\n744\n00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,710\nwhich is then gonna force that user to\ngo to the administrator and say hey,\n\n745\n00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,980\nmy account is locked.\n\n746\n00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,600\nAnd now as an administrator, I can say,\nwell, did you mistype your password?\n\n747\n00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,937\nI mean, it's no big deal,\nyou're not going to fired, yet.\n\n748\n00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:19,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, did you mistype it or\n\n749\n00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,900\nis this something I've got to worry about?\n\n750\n00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,620\nIs somebody trying to\ncrack your password and\n\n751\n00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,540\ndoing some password guessing somewhere?\n\n752\n00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,410\nBut it gives me a chance to\ninvestigate that scenario there.\n\n753\n00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,124\nLogon duration,\nhow long it's going to stay Stay locked.\n\n754\n00:38:31,124 --> 00:38:33,504\nCan I have a lock out threshold?\n\n755\n00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:39,780\n>> Yeah, the amount of invalid log in\nattempts it takes to lock the account.\n\n756\n00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,800\nWe can set it at six attempts.\n\n757\n00:38:43,802 --> 00:38:45,590\nAt six attempts,\nyou've tried six times and\n\n758\n00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:48,710\nyou can't remember it,\nit'll lock your account out.\n\n759\n00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,850\nIt helps to mitigate the brute force\nattacks where people just can't try\n\n760\n00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,080\nover and over and over and\nover and over and over.\n\n761\n00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,220\nSo we just lock it down.\n\n762\n00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,830\n>> And\nyou have to be careful with that one.\n\n763\n00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,440\nWith that setting,\nlike I know a lot of our military pros,\n\n764\n00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,600\ntalking to our military guys,\nthey'll set that to three.\n\n765\n00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,750\nAnd that's pretty low, three bad attempts.\n\n766\n00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,830\nI've mistyped my own password three times.\n\n767\n00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,811\nYou come in on a Monday morning.\n\n768\n00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:14,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You happen to change your password on\n\n769\n00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,160\nFriday afternoon before you left.\n\n770\n00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,000\nYou come in Monday morning, it's 8\no'clock, my eyes aren't even open yet.\n\n771\n00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,535\nI haven't had my first Mountain Dew yet.\n\n772\n00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:22,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I mistype my password.\n\n773\n00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,420\nWell, there's one.\n\n774\n00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,760\nAnd then I go, oh yeah,\nthat's right, I changed it.\n\n775\n00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,830\nAnd I think I changed it to this.\n\n776\n00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,820\nOh, well, there's two.\n\n777\n00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,130\nSo it's real easy to get\nto that third strike.\n\n778\n00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,810\nSo don't make more work for your network.\n\n779\n00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,770\nCuz you'll end up locking\nyour users out and\n\n780\n00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,510\nthey're gonna be calling all day\ngoing hey, I locked my account again.\n\n781\n00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,200\nSo pick a reasonable number,\ndon't set that to one or two.\n\n782\n00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,420\nWhat are the odds of somebody guessing\nyour password correct on the first\n\n783\n00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,040\nfive tries?\n\n784\n00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,420\nSlim to none.\n\n785\n00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,200\nRight?\n\n786\n00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,950\n>> Yep.\nThe very last note I have,\n\n787\n00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,930\nreset account lockout, counter after.\n\n788\n00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:01,110\nAnd this is how long time passes\nbefore that account is unlocked.\n\n789\n00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,900\nSo you could set it for\nhour maybe or something.\n\n790\n00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,034\nAfter that hour\n>> Yeah it's all about how long does it\n\n791\n00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,951\nremember your strikes.\n\n792\n00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:17,020\nLet's say we set the account\nlock threshold at three strikes.\n\n793\n00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,956\nSo if I come in on Monday morning and\nI missed Type my password,\n\n794\n00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:22,331\nthat's strike one.\n\n795\n00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:25,250\nAnd then I type it incorrectly and\nI go about my day.\n\n796\n00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,673\nI go to lunch,\nmaybe I have a couple beers.\n\n797\n00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:28,356\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I come back.\n\n798\n00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:29,320\n>> That's crazy.\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n799\n00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,265\nI mistype my password after lunch.\n\n800\n00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mistype my password again.\n\n801\n00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,170\nIs that strike two, or is that strike one?\n\n802\n00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,620\nThis is at your home office right?\n\n803\n00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,780\n>> Yes my home office.\n\n804\n00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,750\n>> Never never here on stage,\nwe don't drink here at IT Pro but\n\n805\n00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,110\nif how long is it going to\nremember those strikes,\n\n806\n00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,770\nso if this was set to five hours that one\nat lunch would be strike too because it\n\n807\n00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,850\nstill remembers the bad atempt from\nthe morning, if the reset account lockout\n\n808\n00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,110\ncounter was set to like 30 minutes,\nthen that one at lunchtime would be\n\n809\n00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,910\nstrike one because it would have forgotten\nall about that strike in the morning.\n\n810\n00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,810\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Now I will show you too,\n\n811\n00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,770\nwhen we turn these on,\n\n812\n00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,270\nyou'll notice that it's set to zero\ninvalid logon attempts by default.\n\n813\n00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,360\nMeaning that you can guess\nas many times as you want.\n\n814\n00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,070\nIt's never going to lock the account.\n\n815\n00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,990\nAnd that means the other two\nsettings are not applicable, right?\n\n816\n00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,620\nThey don't really matter,\nbecause this is turned off.\n\n817\n00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,026\nAs soon as I set that threshold\nto a value, like five,\n\n818\n00:41:23,026 --> 00:41:28,510\nWindows is going to tell me, well then do\nyou want me to turn on those other two,\n\n819\n00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,990\nand here's a recommended setting for\nthem, 30 minutes.\n\n820\n00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,640\nAnd you don't have to stick with that,\nbut you can't change it here.\n\n821\n00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,610\nYou go ahead and say okay.\n\n822\n00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,490\nNow if I want to change that duration and\n\n823\n00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:44,040\nsay well I want that account to be locked\nout for two hours, actually I'm sorry.\n\n824\n00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,600\nThat is in minutes, so I'd have to do a.\n\n825\n00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,252\nCan I add?\nYeah.\n\n826\n00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:50,150\n[LAUGH] Math, you know?\n\n827\n00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,150\nIt's too early here.\n\n828\n00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,640\n>> It's crazy.\nSo I can set that.\n\n829\n00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,710\nOr how long do I want to reset\nthat counter after, you know,\n\n830\n00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,590\nif I want to make that.\n\n831\n00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,020\nWe'll do another 120 or\nsomething like that.\n\n832\n00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,610\nAll right, very good.\n\n833\n00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:09,130\nYep, you know what, so under the local\npolicy, let's click on audit policy.\n\n834\n00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:16,990\nAll right, we've looked in\nhere before to enable turn on,\n\n835\n00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:20,630\nauditing of the system, so if we do that,\nyou know, the password stuff.\n\n836\n00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:25,490\nWe can turn on our auto ding and see, you\nknow, look for patterns if somebody was.\n\n837\n00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:30,565\nLike the daggum janitor, he was trying it\nevery night, and locking some person out.\n\n838\n00:42:30,565 --> 00:42:33,200\n>> 1 o'clock in the morning, somebody's\ntrying to log in to that account.\n\n839\n00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,080\nAnd you can see we actually still have\nit from our security episode we did.\n\n840\n00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,190\nI still have our object\naccess auditing enabled.\n\n841\n00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,110\nWoohoo.\n\n842\n00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:44,400\nYep.\n>> Let's skip down two folders into\n\n843\n00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,810\nSecurity Options.\n\n844\n00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880\n>> A lot up there.\n\n845\n00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,080\n>> And that second one down,\nBlock Microsoft Accounts.\n\n846\n00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,730\nRight?\nSo, on Windows 8,\n\n847\n00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:00,760\nyou can log in with a local account,\nor login with your Microsoft Account.\n\n848\n00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,210\nIt will sync settings\n>> It's really cool.\n\n849\n00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,200\n>> Yeah, I like it.\n\n850\n00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,030\nAwesome, awesome thing, let's say in\nyour business that you don't want people\n\n851\n00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,399\nto log in with a Microsoft account and\n>> Mm hm\n\n852\n00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:16,130\n>> You know trusting the PC and seeking\n\n853\n00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:22,740\n>> Password and all sorts of things.\n\n854\n00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:28,200\nThis setting right here makes so they\ncannot log in with a Microsoft account.\n\n855\n00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,830\n>> Yeah, it's to prevent anybody from\nbeing able to access it with a Microsoft,\n\n856\n00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,880\nso they would have to\nhave a local account,\n\n857\n00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,360\nbecause that is one thing\nyou've got to worry about.\n\n858\n00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:42,260\nNow, with Windows 8, now if we can\nlog on with a Microsoft account,\n\n859\n00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,550\nthen I can walk up to a machine in\nyour company's environment, and\n\n860\n00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,060\npotentially log on to\none of your machines.\n\n861\n00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,490\nBecause you don't have to have\na local account created for\n\n862\n00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,830\nme on that machine, and you don't happen\nto have an account in active directory.\n\n863\n00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,590\nI could potentially log on with my\nHotmail or Windows Live account or\n\n864\n00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,820\nsomething like that.\n\n865\n00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,000\nSo we might want to block those and\nyou can see, users cannot\n\n866\n00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,010\nadd Microsoft accounts or users cannot\nadd or login with Microsoft accounts.\n\n867\n00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,060\nSo good one to know for the exam.\n\n868\n00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:13,730\n>> Yeah and let's see, and let's look at,\n\n869\n00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:19,600\nlet's see a couple of them down, let's see\n>> See audit.\n\n870\n00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:25,120\nShut down system immediately if\nunable to log security events.\n\n871\n00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,270\n>> Shut down,\nsorry I'm not paying attention.\n\n872\n00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,170\n>> Oops, back up.\n\n873\n00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:28,670\nAccounts.\n\n874\n00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,660\nOr audit, in the As.\n\n875\n00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,390\nAudit, yep shut down system immediately.\n\n876\n00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:42,406\nRight, so in some of our auditing stuff,\nright, if it's a company policy that\n\n877\n00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:48,480\nyou have to log, some of these\nsecurity events for whatever,\n\n878\n00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:54,970\nit could be that a person or a computer\nfills up or what not, and if there's\n\n879\n00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,900\nno more hard drive space, it's not logging\nevents, and it could be a big deal.\n\n880\n00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,630\nThat you're not getting\nthose logs on there.\n\n881\n00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:08,320\nAnd if that is the case,\nshut the computer down.\n\n882\n00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,340\nDon't violate anything and\nthat sort of thing.\n\n883\n00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,800\n>> Yeah, you know it's just\na good security practice,\n\n884\n00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,220\nmaybe not as common on a desktop\nmachine that my end user's sitting at.\n\n885\n00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,370\nBut definitely something we would use.\n\n886\n00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:25,390\nIf I can't audit, if I can't log what's\ngoing on in that machine, then I don't\n\n887\n00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,400\nwant anybody using that machine because\nI have no record of what's going on.\n\n888\n00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,810\nThere's no accountability.\n\n889\n00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,240\nIf something was to happen and\n\n890\n00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,900\nsomebody breached my security,\nI'd have no evidence.\n\n891\n00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,120\nI'd have nothing I could take\ninto court to prosecute.\n\n892\n00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,760\nI mean.\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n893\n00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,200\n>> Without those log files I have\nnone of that accountability.\n\n894\n00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,850\nSo I, on our high security systems we\nusually want to shut that thing down\n\n895\n00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,420\nif we can not anymore and\nit can happen easy right.\n\n896\n00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,510\nWe can fill up those log files and forget\nto go in there and truncate them and\n\n897\n00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,370\nclear those files.\n\n898\n00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,989\nOr Joe user starts putting\ntheir move collection.\n\n899\n00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:57,058\n>> Collecting on there.\n\n900\n00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:59,145\n>> [LAUGH] Oh man, yeesh.\n\n901\n00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:02,425\n>> And all the sudden all my\nhard drive space is gone.\n\n902\n00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:05,815\nYour hard drive spice is going to\ngo right along with the space.\n\n903\n00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:09,045\nSo it's all gone, and\nthen we shut that machine down.\n\n904\n00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,220\nThey're beautiful.\n\n905\n00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,120\n>> Yup.\nJust a couple.\n\n906\n00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,470\nThere's the whole thing.\n\n907\n00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,000\nGood stuff.\n\n908\n00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,230\n>> They really are.\n\n909\n00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,140\nAs you guys can see, there's dozens and\ndozens and dozens of settings.\n\n910\n00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,430\nFocus in when your studying here,\nexplorer.\n\n911\n00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,900\nThat's what you need to do when\nyour studying for the exam.\n\n912\n00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,910\nJust go though and play and\nlook at all the different settings and\n\n913\n00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,740\nkind of test it out.\n\n914\n00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,350\nDo like I did, make a dummy account or\nfor your spouse or your kid or\n\n915\n00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,820\nyour dog or whatever.\n\n916\n00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,690\nMake an account for them on the computer.\n\n917\n00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:44,240\nIf you can teach Fido to log in, you know,\nput it on YouTube and you guys will get\n\n918\n00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,200\na billion clicks make some dummy accounts\nand then log in with those accounts.\n\n919\n00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,310\nSet some different settings and see what\nhappens and notice that one thing we\n\n920\n00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,410\ndidn't mention I don't think in there was\nthat you might have noticed that when we\n\n921\n00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:02,720\nwent into our screen saver settings or our\nbackground settings, when you use a policy\n\n922\n00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,480\nto make a change to one of these settings\nit locks the user interface all right.\n\n923\n00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,970\nIt graves that user interface out because\nif I as an admin wanted set a setting,\n\n924\n00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,590\nI want to make sure all\nthe computers on my network\n\n925\n00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,200\nare password protecting the screen saver.\n\n926\n00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,100\nSo if you wiggle the mouse\nto wake them up.\n\n927\n00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,540\nYou're going to have to know\nthe password to get back in.\n\n928\n00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,290\nI don't want Joe user saying, I don't like\nthat.it's a real pain, I have to type in\n\n929\n00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:31,615\nmy password every time and they just\ngo in there and turn the feature off.\n\n930\n00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,495\n>> They pull a personalization and\nturn it off.\n\n931\n00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:34,895\nThat can't happen.\n\n932\n00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:37,245\nSo when we set settings\nthrough our policies,\n\n933\n00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:39,785\nit locks that user interface, disables it.\n\n934\n00:47:39,785 --> 00:47:43,845\nThey cannot override those settings\nwithout making a change to the policies.\n\n935\n00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:44,565\nSo.\n\n936\n00:47:44,565 --> 00:47:45,065\n>> Yeah.\n\n937\n00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:50,637\nHeck, that's all I got on\nconfiguring local policies.\n\n938\n00:47:50,637 --> 00:47:52,327\n>> Yeah,\nwe went through quite a few there.\n\n939\n00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:58,317\nLet me real quick make sure we covered\neverything we need to for the exam.\n\n940\n00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,820\nSo we will double check that, but I do\nthink that is going to lead us into our\n\n941\n00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:10,320\nnext little segment, which is going to be\nthe good old UAC, or User Account Control.\n\n942\n00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,930\n>> Yeah, User Account Control, right.\n\n943\n00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,681\nYeah, neat security thing.\n\n944\n00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:21,572\nThat's what it's, therefore prompting\nthe user when some thing, program,\n\n945\n00:48:21,572 --> 00:48:23,841\nwants to make a change to something.\n\n946\n00:48:23,841 --> 00:48:26,181\nIt needs admin approval.\n\n947\n00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:30,686\nPrevent stuff from running in\nthe background, elevating itself, and\n\n948\n00:48:30,686 --> 00:48:31,770\nrunning a muck.\n\n949\n00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,320\n>> You guys have all heard\nof the UACM I am sure.\n\n950\n00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,460\nWhen Vista first came out it was the\nrunning joke with the Apple commercials\n\n951\n00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,350\nand all of that stuff.\n\n952\n00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,790\nYeah, it can be a little\nannoying at times, right?\n\n953\n00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,520\nIt's a good thing, it really is.\n\n954\n00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,160\nIt's trying to prevent things from running\nin the background without your knowledge.\n\n955\n00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,260\nAnd trying to make sure that the user\nhas the appropriate level of access\n\n956\n00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,910\nin order to execute those things.\n\n957\n00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,880\nAnd so it checks.\n\n958\n00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,010\nIf you're an administrator.\n\n959\n00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,529\nIf you're logged on as\nan administrative account, and\n\n960\n00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:08,317\nyou go to do something that\nrequires administrative access,\n\n961\n00:49:08,317 --> 00:49:11,010\nit's going to pop up a dialog box and\nit says, are you sure?\n\n962\n00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,150\nDid you mean to do this?\n\n963\n00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,170\nAnd you just click yes or no.\n\n964\n00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:16,710\nYou don't have to put your username and\npassword in there.\n\n965\n00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:17,460\n>> Or you could.\n\n966\n00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,400\nYou may have to.\n\n967\n00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,049\n>> We could change that.\n\n968\n00:49:19,049 --> 00:49:20,930\nWhich we're definitely\ngoing to go into here.\n\n969\n00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,880\nBut by default, you know,\n\n970\n00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,740\nthe administrator doesn't\nhave to re enter credentials.\n\n971\n00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,830\nAll he has to do is click yes or no.\n\n972\n00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,620\nWhich is very handy.\n\n973\n00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:33,180\nIf I run something and then something else\nis trying to run in the background and\n\n974\n00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,280\nit's trying to do something that\nrequires administrative access,\n\n975\n00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,440\nthis dialog is going to pop up.\n\n976\n00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,730\nI'm gonna go, wait no.\n\n977\n00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,110\nI didn't say to run that.\n\n978\n00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:42,260\nAnd it gives me a chance to click no,\nand say no no no no.\n\n979\n00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,880\nIf you're not an administrator, and\nyou try to do something that requires\n\n980\n00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,610\nadministrative credentials, then it is\ngoing to prompt you to enter a user name\n\n981\n00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,870\nand password that has\nadministrative access.\n\n982\n00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:55,230\nSo, and if you don't have a user name and\n\n983\n00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,420\npassword then you're not going\nto be able to run that task.\n\n984\n00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,760\nTask.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n985\n00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,570\nYeah.\n\n986\n00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:07,530\nNow, for this next sub-objective,\nconfigure user account control behavior.\n\n987\n00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,400\nRight, so it's settings.\n\n988\n00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,950\nAnd there's two places where we can\ngo to change some of the stuff.\n\n989\n00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:19,890\nThere is a real easy,\nlittle pop-up window.\n\n990\n00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,470\nThen we go to change a little slider bar.\n\n991\n00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:26,780\nTo change its settings in\na much more granular way\n\n992\n00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:30,457\nthrough the local security policy,\nwhich we were just at.\n\n993\n00:50:30,457 --> 00:50:36,100\n>> So why don't we take a gander,\nif we could pull my feed one up.\n\n994\n00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,950\n>> Okay.\n>> There's the settings you were talking\n\n995\n00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,320\nabout, the simple settings right.\n\n996\n00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,420\nThe little slider you're referring to.\n\n997\n00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:47,070\n>> Yeah, by default it's on the little\nthird, the third option from the top.\n\n998\n00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:51,700\nAnd where it's, it prompts for\nthings but it's not real intrusive.\n\n999\n00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,700\nIt doesn't really Take over prompts for\nall sorts of things.\n\n1000\n00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,180\n>> I do like this option,\ncuz the key to this one here,\n\n1001\n00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,890\nnotify me only when apps try to\nmake changes to my computer.\n\n1002\n00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,960\nDon't notify me when I make\nchanges to Windows settings.\n\n1003\n00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,930\nI'm the administrator,\nI know what I'm doing.\n\n1004\n00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,030\nIf I specifically click on it,\n\n1005\n00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,300\nthen don't ask me again if I\nmeant to click on it, right?\n\n1006\n00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,550\nThat's what gets annoying.\n\n1007\n00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,760\nSo this says,\ndon't notify me if I'm doing a change.\n\n1008\n00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,780\nIf some program is trying to do\nsomething in the background and\n\n1009\n00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,190\nmake a change, then yeah,\npop something up.\n\n1010\n00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,750\nBut if I'm doing it don't bother me.\n\n1011\n00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,760\n>> Yeah, let's slide it up one.\n\n1012\n00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,590\nAll right.\n\n1013\n00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,905\nAlways notify, notify for everything.\n\n1014\n00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:36,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You know what,\n\n1015\n00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,000\nit may be ultra secure or something.\n\n1016\n00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,760\nBut heaven's sakes,\nhaving to acknowledge everything.\n\n1017\n00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,190\nIt could potentially\nslow down productivity.\n\n1018\n00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:48,770\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1019\n00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:49,560\n>> And really be a.\n\n1020\n00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,880\n>> A nuisance to users.\n\n1021\n00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,380\n>> It is.\nIt's really annoying, isn't it?\n\n1022\n00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,700\nIt's like everything you do, and\nit keeps popping up this little window.\n\n1023\n00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,850\nAnd especially for administrators, because\nyou and I, when we're on these machines,\n\n1024\n00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:04,300\nwe're doing things that\nrequire administrative access.\n\n1025\n00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,350\nMy end-users shouldn't be doing things\nthat require administrative access for\n\n1026\n00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:08,310\nthe most part.\n\n1027\n00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,280\nSo they shouldn't see it nearly as much.\n\n1028\n00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,530\nBut for IT people,\nas you guys are training to do,\n\n1029\n00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,960\nit can definitely get annoying if\nyou leave it slid up this high.\n\n1030\n00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,450\n>> So let's drop it down\nto the second one there.\n\n1031\n00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:26,410\nAll right, so\nthis one is a little less intrusive.\n\n1032\n00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,860\nNotify me only when Try\nto make the changes, but\n\n1033\n00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,030\ndon't notify me when I make\nchanges to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1034\n00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:36,900\nYou can navigate around and move things,\nit doesn't pop up, none of that stuff.\n\n1035\n00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,900\n>> It really does.\n\n1036\n00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,120\nAnd if you would notice,\n\n1037\n00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,710\nthese two settings are really the same\nas far as when it's gonna pop up.\n\n1038\n00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,300\nNotice that those options aren't changing.\n\n1039\n00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:53,020\nSee what is changing is default or,\ndo not dim my desktop.\n\n1040\n00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,770\nThe thing is, on older machines,\nthat dimming process,\n\n1041\n00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:01,850\nwhen it grays the screen out and throws up\nthat little dialog that says yes or no,\n\n1042\n00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:06,520\nthat takes a little bit of processing\npower and graphical power.\n\n1043\n00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,680\nOn an older machine,\nthat can choke your system.\n\n1044\n00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,080\nAnd make it unresponsive when it\ntries to gray out that screen.\n\n1045\n00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,630\nSo this option here is helpful\non those older machines.\n\n1046\n00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,760\nIt is, as Nate points out,\n\n1047\n00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,115\na little less secure because\nwhen we have it on this spot\n\n1048\n00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:25,875\nit's gonna gray out everything except the\nwindow and that's all you can click on.\n\n1049\n00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:30,505\nYou know, it's what we call a modal\ndialogue box where nothing is clickable\n\n1050\n00:53:30,505 --> 00:53:33,695\nI can only click on, yes or no or\nput in my user name and password.\n\n1051\n00:53:33,695 --> 00:53:37,600\nThis option here,\nnow it's not graying out my screen so\n\n1052\n00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:43,180\nI could potentially just move that window\nover, not click yes or no or put in\n\n1053\n00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:47,620\nan administrative password and try to do\nsomething else and continue to function.\n\n1054\n00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,265\nSo, not as secure but,\non an older system may be an option.\n\n1055\n00:53:51,265 --> 00:53:52,790\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1056\n00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:57,055\nAnd dragging that guy all the way down,\nit just turns everything off.\n\n1057\n00:53:57,055 --> 00:53:58,980\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It's off.\n\n1058\n00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,405\nYou can go about your business and\ndo whatever you like.\n\n1059\n00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,425\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Definitely not recommended.\n\n1060\n00:54:04,425 --> 00:54:07,445\nYou know, UAC, user account,\nUAC it is a good thing.\n\n1061\n00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:08,815\n>> UAC.\nYeah.\n\n1062\n00:54:08,815 --> 00:54:10,485\nIt's a good thing.\n\n1063\n00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:16,265\nDefinitely want the UAC enabled,\nthe false setting right?\n\n1064\n00:54:16,265 --> 00:54:18,610\nI mean it works great, does its thing.\n\n1065\n00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,900\n>> I like it there in that middle.\n\n1066\n00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,100\nIn fact,\nI just don't bother even coming in and\n\n1067\n00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,780\nchanging it because I know\nthat's what it's set to.\n\n1068\n00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,180\nAnd I also know if we want a little\nmore control over the UAC,\n\n1069\n00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,230\nwe've got another place\nwe can go than here.\n\n1070\n00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,440\nTo get a little finer,\n\n1071\n00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,590\nfiner more granular control\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1072\n00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,730\n>> It is we would say over these settings\n\n1073\n00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:43,630\nso why don't we take a peek at those next\n>> Mm-hm Yep, we, yeah we're right up on\n\n1074\n00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:49,850\nour break on our break here and do yeah,\njust shows that dimming desktop.\n\n1075\n00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,940\nI'll pull up a virtual machine so\nwe can see that.\n\n1076\n00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:53,590\n>> Okay.\n\n1077\n00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,340\n>> Yeah, and we'll take a look\nat the granular settings,\n\n1078\n00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,130\nright, with the wonderful\nlocal security policy.\n\n1079\n00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:02,660\nYeah, and we'll finish that up.\n\n1080\n00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:03,160\n>> Sounds like plan.\n>> Sweet.\n\n1081\n00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,660\n>> See you guys back in a few.\n\n1082\n00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,659\n>> After the break.\n\n1083\n00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:12,243\n[SOUND]\n\n1084\n00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:14,270\n>> And welcome.\n\n1085\n00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,640\nAll right, and yeah.\n\n1086\n00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,360\nSo we're gonna finish up\nwith user account control.\n\n1087\n00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,390\n>> We'll took a look at some of\nthose granular settings that\n\n1088\n00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,530\nwe can do with the group policies, and\nnow we're gonna do a little demo for you.\n\n1089\n00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,370\nActually we didn't, did we?\n\n1090\n00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:26,170\nI forgot.\n>> We didn't.\n\n1091\n00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,450\nWe got close.\n\n1092\n00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,680\nYeah, we ran out of time there.\n\n1093\n00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,880\nAll of you guys that were hanging on the\nedge of your seat waiting to see how much\n\n1094\n00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,340\nmore control you could have over that UAC,\nhere you go.\n\n1095\n00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,120\nSo let's do it.\n\n1096\n00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,210\nLet's go into, do you want to do this one?\n\n1097\n00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,050\n>> Yeah.\nYou know what?\n\n1098\n00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,210\nYeah.\nI'll do this one.\n\n1099\n00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:44,010\n>> All right.\n\n1100\n00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:47,970\n>> So UAC right, so we,\nWe'll invoke this guy.\n\n1101\n00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,580\nWe'll use our steam client.\n\n1102\n00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,460\n>> It's one of our favorites, right?\n\n1103\n00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,790\nI think we use this in every episode.\n\n1104\n00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,960\nSo steam you should help us out here man.\n\n1105\n00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,660\n>> And so we're gonna choose a sorry,\nI didn't mean to cut you off.\n\n1106\n00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,540\n>> It's all right.\nI'm trying to\n\n1107\n00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,730\nget us access to that library,\ncuz we need to be in that beta program.\n\n1108\n00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:03,750\nSteam, come on.\n\n1109\n00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,233\n>> I know we have the beta.\n\n1110\n00:56:06,233 --> 00:56:07,278\n>> Yeah, hook us up there.\n\n1111\n00:56:07,278 --> 00:56:10,486\nBut anyway,\nNate's gonna demo the default behavior,\n\n1112\n00:56:10,486 --> 00:56:13,087\nas we talked about in\nthat previous segment.\n\n1113\n00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:17,447\nAdministrators are gonna get\na prompt that just says yes or no.\n\n1114\n00:56:17,447 --> 00:56:20,256\nThey don't have to retype\ntheir password every time.\n\n1115\n00:56:20,256 --> 00:56:22,096\nBut here he's gonna run an app as Admin.\n\n1116\n00:56:22,096 --> 00:56:27,230\nAll right, yep, and so this, so now we're\nlooking at the secure desktop, right?\n\n1117\n00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,730\nThe desktop is dimmed.\n\n1118\n00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:32,120\nWe can't interact with anything behind it.\n\n1119\n00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,010\n>> As far as your toolbar's gone.\n\n1120\n00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:34,870\n>> Yeah, toolbar's gone.\n\n1121\n00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:35,390\n>> Yeah.\n\n1122\n00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,850\n>> And so, this is the default setting.\n\n1123\n00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:42,300\nAnd for admins,\nI'm logged in as an administrator.\n\n1124\n00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,260\nAnd it's a prompt for consent.\n\n1125\n00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,620\nSo it's yes or no.\n\n1126\n00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,200\nDo you want to run this?\n\n1127\n00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,210\nWell, I'll say no.\n\n1128\n00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,650\nSo that's that.\n\n1129\n00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:57,460\nWhat is that old commercial, Mac has sent\nyou a salutation, would you like to reply?\n\n1130\n00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:04,500\nI date myself here way back with the vista\ncommercials in the UAC, so anyway.\n\n1131\n00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n1132\n00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,630\nAll right.\nThanks, Mike.\n\n1133\n00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so secpol, right?\n\n1134\n00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,780\nSecure to policy.\n\n1135\n00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,450\nI'll go this route.\n\n1136\n00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:14,790\nIt's a little bit different\nto get to the same thing,\n\n1137\n00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,530\ninto the local security policy.\n\n1138\n00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,810\nI'll unpin that and make that big.\n\n1139\n00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:27,400\nAll right, now this is going\nto be like the same settings.\n\n1140\n00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,780\nRight?\nJust not, I guess, all the settings.\n\n1141\n00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:32,790\n>> Basically,\n\n1142\n00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:37,480\nwhat he's done is, he's launched a tool\ncalled secpol.msc, s,e,c,p,o,l,., m, s, c.\n\n1143\n00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,500\nAnd what that gets you is a subset\nInstead of your normal local GPO.\n\n1144\n00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,260\nSo if you want to work with your security\nsettings, you can fire that up and\n\n1145\n00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,900\nget right to the security\noptions in your local GPO.\n\n1146\n00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,530\nYou notice he doesn't see\nany of the other options.\n\n1147\n00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:54,970\nIn fact,\nwe could compare side by side here.\n\n1148\n00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,220\nSee how good Jason is at flipping back and\nforth.\n\n1149\n00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:02,790\nSo he's got Secpol pulled up and\nyou see Account Policies, Local Policies,\n\n1150\n00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,890\nPublic Kay Policies, things like that.\n\n1151\n00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:09,705\nAnd then, if Jason will flip over to my\nscreen, there we have, wow, he is quick.\n\n1152\n00:58:09,705 --> 00:58:13,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I have that MMC we made in that earlier\n\n1153\n00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,360\nsegment underneath my computer\nconfiguration, Windows settings,\n\n1154\n00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,370\nsecurity settings.\n\n1155\n00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,820\nAnd there's the exact same things.\n\n1156\n00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,760\nAccount policies, local policies,\npublic key policies, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1157\n00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,449\nSo just another way to get to the same\nsettings that you're working.\n\n1158\n00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,080\n>> All right.\n\n1159\n00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:34,900\n>> Now, yeah, to do more granular\ncontrol over UAC behavior,\n\n1160\n00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:41,690\nand that's what we're after, there's\na setting in here, and we're going to go.\n\n1161\n00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:42,588\n>> A bunch of them.\n\n1162\n00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:44,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n1163\n00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:48,770\nAnd the local policies and\nin the security options and\n\n1164\n00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:52,650\nall the way down to the bottom and\nthere we go.\n\n1165\n00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,020\nUser account control stuff.\n\n1166\n00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,020\n>> We've got about eight,\nten settings down there.\n\n1167\n00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,700\nSo, we saw that slider\nin our previous segment.\n\n1168\n00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,740\nWhere we had some control\nover the behavior of the UAC.\n\n1169\n00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,410\nAnd this is just going to, as Nate\npointed out, much more granular control.\n\n1170\n00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,780\nAnd so which one are you going to demo for\nus here.\n\n1171\n00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,770\nAll right, so this guy down here.\n\n1172\n00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,690\nI just double click on him, user count\ncontrol behavior of the elevation prompt,\n\n1173\n00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:21,340\nfor administrators in admin approval mode.\n\n1174\n00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:26,530\nThe default prom fortune it a consent for\na non Windows Binaries.\n\n1175\n00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,220\nSo anything that's not built into Windows,\nmore or\n\n1176\n00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,425\nless, will get a prompt\n>> Should prompt you.\n\n1177\n00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:34,117\nFor this.\n\n1178\n00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:36,290\nBut not ask you for your password, right?\n\n1179\n00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,660\nJust a yes or no type click thing?\n\n1180\n00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n1181\n00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,428\nOr there's no prompt at all.\n\n1182\n00:59:42,428 --> 00:59:44,520\n>> Mm-hm, hm, Okay.\n\n1183\n00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,300\nYou don't see it if.\n\n1184\n00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:51,140\nSo we run good old reg edit.\n\n1185\n00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,265\n[LAUGH], Bad example.\n\n1186\n00:59:53,265 --> 00:59:56,730\n>> That's what it was supposed to do,\nright?\n\n1187\n00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,100\n>> Yeah,\nthat's what it was supposed to do.\n\n1188\n00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,350\n>> Yeah, that's a good way to UAC.\n\n1189\n00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:02,270\nSo what are you going to change that to?\n\n1190\n01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,560\nAll right, so we drop this down.\n\n1191\n01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,410\nWe've got a couple of options.\n\n1192\n01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:09,260\nWe're going to say, prompt for\ncredentials, on a security install.\n\n1193\n01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,170\nAll right, click Apply, click OK.\n\n1194\n01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:16,810\nAnd so now, when we try to\nlaunch it as an administrator,\n\n1195\n01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:20,630\ninstead of saying, yes or no,\n>> Well prove it to me.\n\n1196\n01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:21,500\nI don't believe it.\n\n1197\n01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,015\nWe'll see.\n\n1198\n01:00:22,015 --> 01:00:25,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Show me, come back over here,\n\n1199\n01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,050\nrun it as that, and there we go.\n\n1200\n01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:32,690\n>> And now we have to enter in\na password in the secure desktop.\n\n1201\n01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:38,335\n>> So you've just taken an annoyance\nfrom a three to an eight, right?\n\n1202\n01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:39,740\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> Which is a good question,\n\n1203\n01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,150\nwe had some questions from\nour viewers out there.\n\n1204\n01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,670\nWe had a little issue with\none of our monitors here so\n\n1205\n01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:46,010\nyou're not going to be able to see those.\n\n1206\n01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,060\nApologize for\nnot getting right onto your questions.\n\n1207\n01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,090\nBut I had one person ask us,\nit's annoying.\n\n1208\n01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:52,160\nShould I turn it off?\n\n1209\n01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:54,680\n>> No, no.\n\n1210\n01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,080\nUAC is a great thing.\n\n1211\n01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,460\n>> Yeah.\nIt is.\n\n1212\n01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:01,380\n>> It's a\n>> You should never turn it off.\n\n1213\n01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,540\n>> You should not.\n\n1214\n01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,160\nIt's helping, keeping your machine secure.\n\n1215\n01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,410\nWith all the malware, and\n\n1216\n01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,710\nthe different ways to introduce that\nmalware into your machine nowadays,\n\n1217\n01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:13,040\nyou want as many things as you can\ntrying to protect you and keep you safe.\n\n1218\n01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,170\nEspecially when you're Jiminy click it,\nand\n\n1219\n01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:20,150\nyou install different things without\nbeing careful, you want that UAC.\n\n1220\n01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,040\nTo protection back there.\n\n1221\n01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,890\nSo no, I would say don't turn it off.\n\n1222\n01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,640\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nnon administrators,\n\n1223\n01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,690\nyou're in users,\nreally shouldn't see that too often,\n\n1224\n01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,330\nbecause they shouldn't be doing things\nthat require administrative access.\n\n1225\n01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:36,810\nAnd if they are, and they're getting that\nprompt, that's probably a good thing,\n\n1226\n01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:39,740\nbecause it's stopping them from doing\nsomething that they're really not\n\n1227\n01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,160\nsupposed to be doing in the first place.\n\n1228\n01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:44,030\nAnd you do, you get used to it.\n\n1229\n01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:48,473\nI mean, it's really not that bad,\nit doesn't pop up all the time when you\n\n1230\n01:01:48,473 --> 01:01:52,774\nput that default setting,\ndon't prompt me when I'm making changes,\n\n1231\n01:01:52,774 --> 01:01:57,071\nI don't see it that often, and\nwhen I do, it's just one click, and for\n\n1232\n01:01:57,071 --> 01:02:01,250\nthe security that I'm getting out of it,\nthat one click is worth it.\n\n1233\n01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,409\nSo I would say no, don't turn it off.\n\n1234\n01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,750\nChange your configurations if\nit's annoying you too much, but\n\n1235\n01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,930\ndon't turn it off completely.\n\n1236\n01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:10,625\nDon't disable it.\n\n1237\n01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,220\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1238\n01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:17,470\nThe second question we have, can this\ncause problems for installing programs?\n\n1239\n01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,180\nAnd yes, it can.\n\n1240\n01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:20,760\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1241\n01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,500\n>> It can.\n\n1242\n01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:26,402\nAnd some of the older ones, like\nWindows XP, before user count control,\n\n1243\n01:02:26,402 --> 01:02:30,630\nprograms I ran with administrative rights.\n\n1244\n01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,500\nThey could and\njust kind of do whatever they wanted, and\n\n1245\n01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,940\nto kind of reign everything in.\n\n1246\n01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,790\nAnd Microsoft introduced\nuser count control, and so\n\n1247\n01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,790\nsome older Pprograms are looking for that.\n\n1248\n01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:48,700\nAnd if, you know, UAC blocks it,\nthen yeah it can cause problems.\n\n1249\n01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,450\nBut it's easy to work around.\n\n1250\n01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:52,140\n>> Yeah.\nSome of the older apps that you might\n\n1251\n01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,080\nhave out there, they don't understand UAC.\n\n1252\n01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,310\nThey were written before the UAC\nwas brought into play so\n\n1253\n01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:02,350\nthey don't know to trigger the UAC and\nask for administrative credentials.\n\n1254\n01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:06,210\nSo when they try to install it\ndoesn't work because they don't have,\n\n1255\n01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:10,050\nwrite into those protected locations and\nthings like that.\n\n1256\n01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,920\nSo, you definitely can run into\nan issue there because, again,\n\n1257\n01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:16,900\nthe application just doesn't\nknow how to trigger the UAC.\n\n1258\n01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,350\nAnd how do we get around that?\n\n1259\n01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,140\nWe just\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1260\n01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,880\n>> Right click.\n\n1261\n01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,490\n>> We have an application compatibility,\n\n1262\n01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:27,095\nin our compatibility settings,\nwe discussed that earlier.\n\n1263\n01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,900\n>> Mm-hm.\nLittle checkmark, where we could.\n\n1264\n01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,250\nI don't think in this segment we did, but\n>> I don't think it was even with\n\n1265\n01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:32,910\nyou, either.\n\n1266\n01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:33,600\n>> No, probably not.\n\n1267\n01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,390\n>> I think I was with Don.\n\n1268\n01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,790\n>> You and Don took care of that one.\n\n1269\n01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,990\nSo if you guys remember that episode,\nif not go check it out.\n\n1270\n01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:43,290\nBut we can create\nshortcut to a program and\n\n1271\n01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:47,390\nthen we can put a little check mark for\nrun as administrator.\n\n1272\n01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:52,020\nWe can right click on an executable and\nchoose run as administrator.\n\n1273\n01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:55,710\nSo the executable doesn't know to\ntrigger we can right click and\n\n1274\n01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,420\ntrigger it ourselves manually.\n\n1275\n01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,130\n>> You know what let's.\n\n1276\n01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,060\n>> To give it those.\n\n1277\n01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,310\nWhy don't I just show you where it's at?\n\n1278\n01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:05,010\nLet's do it.\nWe've got computers like right here.\n\n1279\n01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:05,591\n>> Show me what you got.\n\n1280\n01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,439\n>> Yeah, so on right here,\n\n1281\n01:04:07,439 --> 01:04:11,801\nlet's just say we always want to launch\nthe steam client as an administrator.\n\n1282\n01:04:11,801 --> 01:04:15,721\nLet's say this client was written for\nXP, and UAC is just messing.\n\n1283\n01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:16,341\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n1284\n01:04:16,341 --> 01:04:19,550\nEverything, you know what Mike and\nI are talking about.\n\n1285\n01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:23,484\nAnd here, compatibility, right?\n\n1286\n01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,220\nThere.\n\n1287\n01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,576\nRun this program as an administrator.\n\n1288\n01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:31,770\nWe can also run that troubleshooter,\nor we can set it to this fun stuff.\n\n1289\n01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,870\nAnd we'll get,\nwe've already covered all of that stuff.\n\n1290\n01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:34,600\nYou can watch that.\n\n1291\n01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,280\nBut that's where talking.\n\n1292\n01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,840\n>> That is handy because I have some older\nprograms that run into that issue and\n\n1293\n01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,680\nwhat inevitably happens is you double\nclick on it and it doesn't work.\n\n1294\n01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,860\nAnd you're like oh, that's right,\nI gotta right click, run as administrator.\n\n1295\n01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:51,952\nAnd after the umpteenth time of doing\nthat, he's like [SOUND] how, you know.\n\n1296\n01:04:51,952 --> 01:04:54,285\nSo you can now put that little\ncheck mark in there and\n\n1297\n01:04:54,285 --> 01:04:56,736\nit'll remember to run as\nadministrator every time.\n\n1298\n01:04:56,736 --> 01:05:00,270\nSo that can definitely cause problems.\n\n1299\n01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,800\nGood question out there.\n\n1300\n01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,480\nCan cause problems but\nthere are ways we can deal with that.\n\n1301\n01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,322\nDid we get all the settings we wanted to\nlook like at in there for the most part?\n\n1302\n01:05:10,322 --> 01:05:14,338\nYeah I think for our purposes right now\n>> Keep in mind that as I said with\n\n1303\n01:05:14,338 --> 01:05:18,250\nthe other settings you do not have\nto memorize every one of those.\n\n1304\n01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,240\nIt is mainly just being able\nto get into that location,\n\n1305\n01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,980\nknow where those settings are.\n\n1306\n01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,400\nFamiliarize yourself, at least read\nthem and know what the options are.\n\n1307\n01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,880\nThen if you get into the exam and\nyou see a question about that you'll\n\n1308\n01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,770\nbe familiar with it and go, yeah that\nis one of the settings that you can do.\n\n1309\n01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,820\nSo at least go in there and\nexplore a little bit.\n\n1310\n01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,269\nThere was something else.\n\n1311\n01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:44,260\nWe were going to and maybe that was it.\n\n1312\n01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,605\nI can't think of anything else.\n\n1313\n01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:49,600\n[LAUGH] If I do, I'll bring it back.\n\n1314\n01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,970\nWhat was it?\n\n1315\n01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:56,870\nI was going to mention, some of our\nviewers out there might be old school.\n\n1316\n01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,290\nRight, been doing this for\na little while, and\n\n1317\n01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:02,950\njust trying to update their certifications\nto Windows 8 and things like that.\n\n1318\n01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,580\nAnd you might be thinking,\nwell what about that run as.\n\n1319\n01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:06,960\nI've mentioned that a couple of times.\n\n1320\n01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,190\nWe talk about right click,\nrun as administrator.\n\n1321\n01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:14,670\nReally, the UAC is kind of the evolved\nform of that run as, i mean.\n\n1322\n01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:19,620\nMicrosoft has always said as a best\npractice that we shouldn't be logging on\n\n1323\n01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,050\nwith an administrative account.\n\n1324\n01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,750\nAdministrators should have two accounts.\n\n1325\n01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,630\nAn administrator account and\na standard user account.\n\n1326\n01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:28,540\nAnd when we logged on back\nwith 2000 Windows XP,\n\n1327\n01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:33,560\nwe were supposed to be logging on as our,\njust our standard user account and\n\n1328\n01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,920\nthen any time we needed to do something\nthat required administrative credentials\n\n1329\n01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,620\nwe would right click on something\nrun as and then have to type in.\n\n1330\n01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,385\nBut what most administrators did,\nincluding myself, was.\n\n1331\n01:06:45,385 --> 01:06:45,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1332\n01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,328\n>> Yeah.\nThat's too much work.\n\n1333\n01:06:47,328 --> 01:06:48,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm just going to\n\n1334\n01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,725\nlog on as the administrator.\n\n1335\n01:06:49,725 --> 01:06:50,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1336\n01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,080\nthat way I don't have to deal with that.\n\n1337\n01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,240\nThe problem with that, though,\n\n1338\n01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,670\nis now everything that I do is running\nunder administrative credentials.\n\n1339\n01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:00,030\nChecking my email, surfing the internet.\n\n1340\n01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,920\nIf I happen to click on some malware link,\n\n1341\n01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,360\nit could potentially be running\nwith administrative access.\n\n1342\n01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:08,330\nWith the UAC,\none of the things we did not mention, and\n\n1343\n01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:12,050\nwe could maybe do a little demo for\nthis, too.\n\n1344\n01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:16,800\nWhen you run that UAC, if you're logged\non as a standard user, all right?\n\n1345\n01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,610\nAnd then you run something as\nadministrator or click on that UAC and\n\n1346\n01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:25,690\nprovide administrative access, only that\none task had administrative access, right?\n\n1347\n01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,790\nEverything else is still\nrunning as standard user.\n\n1348\n01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:31,040\nSo if you went into your task manager,\nand you guys should try this at home.\n\n1349\n01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:35,770\nLog in with a standard account and launch\n\n1350\n01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:38,730\nan application that requires\nadministrative access, and\n\n1351\n01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:42,570\nthen provide a user name and\npassword that has administrative access.\n\n1352\n01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:46,630\nThen open up your task manager,\nshow processes from all users and\n\n1353\n01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:51,210\ntake a look at the user accounts, what the\ncontext is of those different processes,\n\n1354\n01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:54,120\nand you'll see that everything is\nrunning under your standard account,\n\n1355\n01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,280\nexcept that one app like Steam would be\nrunning under your administrative account.\n\n1356\n01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,050\nSo that way malware and\nstuff like that is less likely\n\n1357\n01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:06,880\nto gain administrative access when\nyou click on something like that.\n\n1358\n01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,530\nSo.\n>> Sweet.\n\n1359\n01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:08,040\nThanks Mike.\n\n1360\n01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:08,880\n>> Makes sense.\n\n1361\n01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> Love it.\n\n1362\n01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:11,530\n>> And there's user account control.\n\n1363\n01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,240\n>> That is it in a nutshell.\n\n1364\n01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,160\nThere's a lot to it, right.\n\n1365\n01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:15,770\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n1366\n01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:18,120\nAnd I had people say it's annoying,\nand I understand.\n\n1367\n01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,260\nYou get used to it, and\nI think the benefits.\n\n1368\n01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,480\nSo it is annoying, I mean,\nI'm not going to lie.\n\n1369\n01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,870\nBut the benefits out weigh the annoyance.\n\n1370\n01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:30,058\nSo in the end it's really not that bad.\n\n1371\n01:08:30,058 --> 01:08:31,485\n>> Yeah.\n\n1372\n01:08:31,485 --> 01:08:38,910\nSo up next right, so we still have secure\nboot to cover and smart screen filter.\n\n1373\n01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,040\n>> Good stuff.\n\n1374\n01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,200\nGood stuff there.\n\n1375\n01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,470\n>> So we've got a little bit of time,\nwhat do you want do?\n\n1376\n01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:46,680\nYou want to get started on something?\n\n1377\n01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,440\nShould we take a little early wrap?\n\n1378\n01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,110\nOr\n>> I'll tell you what.\n\n1379\n01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:52,110\n>> Well let's see, what do we got?\n\n1380\n01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:57,250\nWe're going to go into our, why don't we\ngo ahead and take a pick at smartscreen?\n\n1381\n01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,330\nWhy don't we do that now?\n\n1382\n01:08:58,330 --> 01:08:58,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n1383\n01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:01,640\nLet's do it now.\n>> Yeah, let's see what we can get done.\n\n1384\n01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,760\nLet's not waste any valuable time, right?\n\n1385\n01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:05,410\n>> That's right.\n\n1386\n01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:07,795\n>> So let's take a look at it.\n\n1387\n01:09:07,795 --> 01:09:09,070\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we both try to jump in there,\n\n1388\n01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:10,800\nwe're excited we love that SmartScreen.\n\n1389\n01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:20,480\n>> So, SmartScreen right, started out as\na website filter for Internet Explorer,\n\n1390\n01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,700\nif I can get IVGA 1 pulled up over here, I\ncan show you guys as Nate's describing it.\n\n1391\n01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,780\nAnd as far as screen filter,\nwhat it would do is,\n\n1392\n01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:32,920\nMicrosoft has a list of good websites.\n\n1393\n01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,240\nAs you are browsing around\n\n1394\n01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,940\nwith Smart Screen enabled\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1395\n01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:43,100\n>> It'll see where you're going and check\nit against the list of known bad sites.\n\n1396\n01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,330\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Say this is a good site.\n\n1397\n01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:46,430\nThis is a bad site.\n\n1398\n01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:48,420\nWhat do you want to do?\n\n1399\n01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:55,590\nHelp prevent people from just unknowingly\nwandering into like, fishing sites.\n\n1400\n01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:56,440\n>> Right, right.\n\n1401\n01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,120\n>> Things like that.\n\n1402\n01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:03,680\nInadvertently going to those dark corners\nof the internet where you shouldn't go.\n\n1403\n01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,300\n>> Exactly.\n\n1404\n01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,280\nSo as I was thumbing around\nmy different options going,\n\n1405\n01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,880\nwait where did we put that again.\n\n1406\n01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,560\nYour smart screen options and Internet\nExplorer right over here I went to my\n\n1407\n01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,090\nInternet options and\nthen down to my safety.\n\n1408\n01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:22,860\nThen over to turn off smart screen filter,\nand there it is.\n\n1409\n01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:27,020\nAs you can see mine\nactually is turned off.\n\n1410\n01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,110\nNot very secure of me is it?\n\n1411\n01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:32,950\n>> Mike.\n>> We'll tell you that sometimes this\n\n1412\n01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:35,580\ndoes annoy me maybe even more so than UAC.\n\n1413\n01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:39,110\nIf you consider\n>> What kind of websites are you going to?\n\n1414\n01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,750\n>> No, no.\n\n1415\n01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,795\nIt just kinda slows you down.\n\n1416\n01:10:41,795 --> 01:10:43,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not that the website is bad but\n\n1417\n01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:46,980\nit does have to, as you were saying, it\ndoes have to take a look and see if that\n\n1418\n01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:51,800\nsite shows up on the list and if you've\ngot any kind of connectivity issues\n\n1419\n01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,820\nback to Microsoft and things like that,\nit does seem to slow my browsing down.\n\n1420\n01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,790\nI have turned it off before.\n\n1421\n01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:02,250\nI will turn it back on just for\nyou guys out there in TV Land.\n\n1422\n01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,840\nIt's nice, right?\n\n1423\n01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,480\nSo we'll\n>> Now this smart screen filtering, right,\n\n1424\n01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,850\nis unique to Internet Explorer.\n\n1425\n01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,000\nSo, if you do things like Chrome or\n\n1426\n01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,960\nFirefox still have their own kind of\nfiltering, website filtering program,\n\n1427\n01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:25,100\nof course, you know as far as we're\nconcerned right it's just smart screen,\n\n1428\n01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,185\nsmart screen filter right\n>> Mm hm\n\n1429\n01:11:26,185 --> 01:11:27,520\n>> Right you need to enter a spore\n\n1430\n01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,060\n>> Yup and\n\n1431\n01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:31,980\nreally not a lot of options there you turn\nit on or you turn it off and that's all\n\n1432\n01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:36,510\nyou can do, so do you want it to submit\nyour website addresses to Microsoft so\n\n1433\n01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:41,120\nthat they can compare them to the list and\nsee if they are bad or not.\n\n1434\n01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:47,880\nYeah, but you know that was smart screen\nso now it's kind of evolved hasn't it.\n\n1435\n01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:54,062\n>> So it's now kind of evolved out of the\n>> Internet realmy kind of thing.\n\n1436\n01:11:54,062 --> 01:11:59,420\n>> Mm-hmm.\n>> And get into some apps, desktop apps.\n\n1437\n01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:03,030\nApps that downloaded\nthrough Internet Explorer.\n\n1438\n01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:07,130\nAnd like a random EXE off the internet, or\n\n1439\n01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:11,500\nsome driver somewhere or\nsomething, a main non driver.\n\n1440\n01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,500\n>> Put it up.\n\n1441\n01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:17,651\nYeah, it'll prompt and say, hey,\ndo you really want to run this program.\n\n1442\n01:12:17,651 --> 01:12:22,810\nAnd on the break, I was Trying to go\nthrough the internet and try to define one\n\n1443\n01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:28,300\nof these that will get that prompt but I\nguess I don't know the right places to go.\n\n1444\n01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,180\n>> That's what he says on camera, anyway.\n\n1445\n01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,240\n>> Oh, man.\n\n1446\n01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,085\nBut yeah.\n\n1447\n01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:34,778\nJust like the-\n>> I'm not sure if Cammy's watching.\n\n1448\n01:12:34,778 --> 01:12:35,427\nI don't know.\n\n1449\n01:12:35,427 --> 01:12:39,964\n[LAUGH]\n>> Man, that's [LAUGH] and\n\n1450\n01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:45,833\nwe can adjust the settings for\nthat aspect of SmartScreen [CROSSTALK].\n\n1451\n01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:46,930\n>> You wanna show them?\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1452\n01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:49,762\nSo on my machine here right,\n\n1453\n01:12:49,762 --> 01:12:55,090\na great way to get to it is\non the SmartScreen, right?\n\n1454\n01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:58,986\nIs the SmartScreen, oops.\n\n1455\n01:12:58,986 --> 01:13:02,349\n>> And it is kind of a logical extension\nof the SmartScreen that's built into\n\n1456\n01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:06,200\nInternet Explorer, because Internet\nExplorer's SmartScreen is looking at those\n\n1457\n01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,770\nURLs that you type in and\ncomparing them against a list.\n\n1458\n01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:10,931\nAnd now we're extending that out and\nsaying, okay,\n\n1459\n01:13:10,931 --> 01:13:13,812\nwhen you download an app from the app\nstore we're going to take a look and\n\n1460\n01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:15,267\nsee if that shows up on the bad list.\n\n1461\n01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:16,076\nAnd so it is,\n\n1462\n01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:20,750\nlike I said, kind of a logical progression\nof the whole SmartScreen idea.\n\n1463\n01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:28,030\n>> Yep and off to the left side,\nChange Windows SmartScreen.\n\n1464\n01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:31,907\n>> There you go, in the Action Center,\nyou know he typed in SmartScreen, I think,\n\n1465\n01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:35,840\nover there, with the good old Windows 8\nstart screen, on the exam if you needed to\n\n1466\n01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,330\nknow where to go to get there,\nyou can open up your Action Center.\n\n1467\n01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:43,010\nThe little flag icon down\nnext to your system clock\n\n1468\n01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:46,090\nis a quick way to jump\ninto that Action Center.\n\n1469\n01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,731\n>> Good point, good point.\n\n1470\n01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:49,490\nYep, going the long route.\n\n1471\n01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:51,196\nAll right.\nAnd once again,\n\n1472\n01:13:51,196 --> 01:13:56,640\nnot a whole lot of settings on\nthis route going in through here.\n\n1473\n01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,300\nWe have to get administrator approval.\n\n1474\n01:13:59,300 --> 01:13:59,990\nRight?\n\n1475\n01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:04,710\nRunning an unrecognized app from\nthe internet, this is the default setting.\n\n1476\n01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,140\nWe can just warn when running\nan unrecognized app, but\n\n1477\n01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,840\nnot required-\n>> Yeah, so that first option,\n\n1478\n01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,010\nyou'd have to know an administrator\nusername and password, or\n\n1479\n01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,290\nbe logged on as an administrator.\n\n1480\n01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:21,650\nSecond option there, warn but\ndon't require administrative approval, so\n\n1481\n01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:25,880\nnow a standard user could choose yes or\nno.\n\n1482\n01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,760\nSo do we want to that decision\nin the standard user's hands?\n\n1483\n01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,410\nNo.\n\n1484\n01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:31,630\n>> Chances are, no.\n\n1485\n01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:36,545\nAnd the worst one is just turn\nthe whole thing off together.\n\n1486\n01:14:36,545 --> 01:14:39,785\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is that, it works well.\n\n1487\n01:14:39,785 --> 01:14:42,946\nYou know, everything in the Windows\n8 is the most secure Windows-\n\n1488\n01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:43,751\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1489\n01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:44,467\n>> Thing yet.\n\n1490\n01:14:44,467 --> 01:14:48,047\nBut yeah, so\nwe don't want to turn off SmartScreen.\n\n1491\n01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:50,000\nYou know, the default setting,\n\n1492\n01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,710\nif you are logged in as an administrator\nyou could still run it.\n\n1493\n01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:59,230\nYou just say, yes, I am aware that\nit's not downloaded often but\n\n1494\n01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:00,449\nI still want to run it.\n\n1495\n01:15:00,449 --> 01:15:03,830\n>> You might trust the person or\nthe site you're getting it from.\n\n1496\n01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:06,190\nAnd so you want to go ahead and\nrun it anyway.\n\n1497\n01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:09,230\nAnd we've talked about this concept in\nseveral episodes, I think in our security\n\n1498\n01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:14,480\nplus episodes we go over this and Windows\n8 class I believe we've gone over it.\n\n1499\n01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,910\nIn our episodes for our server classes,\nconcept of layers of defense, right?\n\n1500\n01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:22,940\nAnd really when it comes to keeping your\nmachine safe you want multiple layers.\n\n1501\n01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,870\nIf you just have one layer of defense and\n\n1502\n01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:27,670\nsomebody makes it through that layer,\nthat's it, you're done.\n\n1503\n01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:31,185\nSo multiple layers protecting your system,\n\n1504\n01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:36,178\nthat way one of those layers will\nhopefully thwart that attack or\n\n1505\n01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:41,919\nat least you notice it going on and\nnow you can try to do something about it.\n\n1506\n01:15:41,919 --> 01:15:46,896\n>> And so these are the quick settings,\nand similar to user account control,\n\n1507\n01:15:46,896 --> 01:15:49,751\nwhere going this route\nthat we see up here.\n\n1508\n01:15:49,751 --> 01:15:55,895\nYes or no, on or off kind of thing, and\nget into your local security policy or\n\n1509\n01:15:55,895 --> 01:15:59,570\neven banging around\nthe other two segments.\n\n1510\n01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:04,105\nYou can really fine tune stuff that was-\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1511\n01:16:04,105 --> 01:16:08,065\nAs we said I think at the beginning of the\nepisode, just about everything that you\n\n1512\n01:16:08,065 --> 01:16:11,895\ncan configure on your machine can\nbe configured through policy.\n\n1513\n01:16:11,895 --> 01:16:16,215\nAnd most of the time you get much more\ngranular control instead of a simple\n\n1514\n01:16:16,215 --> 01:16:21,320\nwizard interface or a little radio button\nset of options here through the GUI.\n\n1515\n01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:25,380\nWhich is fine most of the time, but\nwhen you want that granular control,\n\n1516\n01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:29,410\nyou just open up that local security\npolicy or the local group policy and\n\n1517\n01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:34,960\nyou've got options there\nthat you can apply.\n\n1518\n01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:39,910\n>> And that leads us to the last\nlittle bit of local security, and\n\n1519\n01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:41,820\nthat is the Secure Boot.\n\n1520\n01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:42,440\n>> Secure Boot?\n\n1521\n01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,050\n>> And we are right up on break.\n\n1522\n01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:48,450\nAnd so we won't, I know, it's tough.\n\n1523\n01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:51,140\nSo yeah,\nwe're going to cover this as we get back.\n\n1524\n01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,160\nBut just as like a little teaser,\nright, Secure Boot.\n\n1525\n01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,215\n>> Yeah, you don't want to miss this.\n\n1526\n01:16:55,215 --> 01:16:56,180\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep.\n\n1527\n01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:58,850\nAll right, so\nwe'll cover that after the break.\n\n1528\n01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:00,794\nAnd we'll see you back then.\n\n1529\n01:17:00,794 --> 01:17:09,071\n[MUSIC]\n\n1530\n01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:10,041\nAnd welcome back.\n\n1531\n01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:15,474\nAll right so the last little bit that\nwe're going to talk about is Secure Boot.\n\n1532\n01:17:15,474 --> 01:17:20,735\nSecure Boot,\npart of this process that Windows\n\n1533\n01:17:20,735 --> 01:17:27,300\n8 uses to start up to prevent\nstuff from attacking it.\n\n1534\n01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,810\n>> See I thought you were going to have\nsome kind of strap that went over your\n\n1535\n01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,014\nboot to keep it on your foot.\n\n1536\n01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,245\n>> [LAUGH] I just got that.\n\n1537\n01:17:34,245 --> 01:17:36,110\n[LAUGH] That's good.\n\n1538\n01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,003\nSo, yeah.\n>> Gotta secure those boots, man.\n\n1539\n01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:42,653\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now there's this boot process that\n\n1540\n01:17:42,653 --> 01:17:45,500\nWindows 8 goes through.\n\n1541\n01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,020\nThat it checks each little\nprocess that it boots up\n\n1542\n01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:53,900\nto make sure that everything is good and\nsecure.\n\n1543\n01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:59,370\nThere's no unsigned malware in there,\nroot kits, generally.\n\n1544\n01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:02,188\n>> And it's really all about\nthat win loader, right,\n\n1545\n01:18:02,188 --> 01:18:06,802\nit's right before that operating system\nkicks in, we've got that little win loader\n\n1546\n01:18:06,802 --> 01:18:10,925\nprogram that goes through all the checks\nand loads up the operating system.\n\n1547\n01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:14,778\nAnd there's potential that somebody\ncould insert a bad loader,\n\n1548\n01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:17,587\nit's what we call,\nlike you said, a root kit.\n\n1549\n01:18:17,587 --> 01:18:21,969\nSo Secure Boot is going to\nmake sure that whatever loader\n\n1550\n01:18:21,969 --> 01:18:26,177\nyou're using has a signature\nstored in the TPM chip.\n\n1551\n01:18:26,177 --> 01:18:30,269\nAnd if you're using a loader that's\nnot signed, and does not match one of\n\n1552\n01:18:30,269 --> 01:18:34,567\nthe signatures in there, it's going\nto prevent that system from starting.\n\n1553\n01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:39,080\nWe've talked about root kits\nin our Security+ episodes.\n\n1554\n01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,020\nThey're nasty because they do get in\nthere underneath the operating system.\n\n1555\n01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:47,870\nThey can completely hide themselves,\nvery difficult to try to remove.\n\n1556\n01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,660\nIf you even notice that it's there.\n\n1557\n01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,390\nIt's usually too late by the time you do.\n\n1558\n01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,610\nIt's already sent all\nyour information out.\n\n1559\n01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:56,980\nWhatever it was trying to do.\n\n1560\n01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,462\nSecure Boot's going to help us with that,\n\n1561\n01:18:58,462 --> 01:19:00,860\nit's going to make sure that we're\nonly using good signed loaders.\n\n1562\n01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:03,690\nSo let's see.\n\n1563\n01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:05,990\nWe're going to do a little\nbit of a demonstration.\n\n1564\n01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:09,960\nI'm going to show you where to\ngo to configure Secure Boot.\n\n1565\n01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,290\nThere are a few pre-reqs that we have\nto consider to enable Secure Boot.\n\n1566\n01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:17,161\n>> We have to have a UEFI.\n\n1567\n01:19:17,161 --> 01:19:21,420\nUEFI what, I say UEFI BIOS.\n\n1568\n01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:27,880\nBut it's a firmware thing that\nstarts before Windows 8 starts,\n\n1569\n01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,950\nthat has all the BIOS settings in there.\n\n1570\n01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:32,710\nI mean, you still do everything\nyou would in BIOS in UEFI.\n\n1571\n01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:38,229\n>> It is a big debate amongst,\nI know, all of us here at ITPro.tv,\n\n1572\n01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:41,920\nthe debate is that we've always had BIOS.\n\n1573\n01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,980\nRight, our basic output input system, and\nthat's what starts that computer, runs\n\n1574\n01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:50,100\nthrough your hardware checks, it turns\ncontrol over to your operating system.\n\n1575\n01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,330\nWell BIOS is being replaced with UEFI,\n\n1576\n01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:58,540\nwhich is my unified extensible\nfirmware interface.\n\n1577\n01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:02,900\nSo it's really replacing BIOS,\nso it's not, as I like to say,\n\n1578\n01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,090\nit's not really BIOS.\n\n1579\n01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,780\nYou have BIOS and you have UEFI.\n\n1580\n01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:10,810\nOthers like to say that it's UEFI BIOS,\nand either way, honestly,\n\n1581\n01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:13,550\nit's semantics, really,\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n1582\n01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:17,004\nDepending on what book you read,\nyou know some,\n\n1583\n01:20:17,004 --> 01:20:20,382\nthey'll say UEFI BIOS,\nor they'll say UEFI.\n\n1584\n01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:21,832\nSo, either way you go.\n\n1585\n01:20:21,832 --> 01:20:25,080\nUnderstand that it's the firmware\nthat starts up that computer,\n\n1586\n01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,821\nruns through the hardware checks.\n\n1587\n01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:28,361\nAnd it's just more advanced.\n\n1588\n01:20:28,361 --> 01:20:29,781\nIt's got more options.\n\n1589\n01:20:29,781 --> 01:20:30,561\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1590\n01:20:30,561 --> 01:20:32,125\n>> BIOS has been around for a long time.\n\n1591\n01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Definitely gone through some updates\n\n1592\n01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:40,090\nbut, this is the new way to go, so\nmost our new hardware does support UEFI.\n\n1593\n01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:43,510\n>> My laptop, your laptop,\nthey'll support us, we'll get to show you.\n\n1594\n01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:45,510\nBut as Dave was saying, pre-req for\n\n1595\n01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:51,650\nenabling the secure boot is to\nhave a native UEFI machine.\n\n1596\n01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:52,570\nRight?\n\n1597\n01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,750\n>> Yep.\nYou also need a good old\n\n1598\n01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,510\nTPM Trusted Platform Module.\n\n1599\n01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,600\nTPM chip.\n\n1600\n01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,900\nIt's a chip,\na physical chip on the mother board.\n\n1601\n01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,940\n>> Part of the mother board.\n\n1602\n01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:05,460\nIt's not like it's\nsomething you can add in.\n\n1603\n01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:08,230\nYou got to buy a mother\nboard that has this.\n\n1604\n01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,180\n>> Some of them you can.\n\n1605\n01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:10,340\n>> Can you?\n>> You can add.\n\n1606\n01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:14,950\nSome have TPM headers that\nlook like a USB header.\n\n1607\n01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,890\nYou know, they're a bunch of little pens.\n\n1608\n01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:18,950\nAnd you can get TPN tips.\n\n1609\n01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:20,560\n>> I've seen this guy\ndo amazing soldering.\n\n1610\n01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,680\nSo I don't doubt you could do that.\n\n1611\n01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,640\n>> It's relatively new, but yeah you can.\n\n1612\n01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,190\nTPN rating and things.\n\n1613\n01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:32,090\n>> Yeah and that TPN,\nthe trusted platform module,\n\n1614\n01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:33,910\nthat's where we're gonna\nstore those signatures.\n\n1615\n01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:38,040\n>> It just needs to store those signatures\nin a place that the bad guys can't get to.\n\n1616\n01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,560\nBecause the whole point is,\nI want to verify that that loader is safe,\n\n1617\n01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,410\nand I want to compare its signature\nagainst those ones that are in the DPM.\n\n1618\n01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:49,750\nAnd if I could get to where you\nwere storing those signatures and\n\n1619\n01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:53,357\nmodify those,\nthen I could make my boot loader.\n\n1620\n01:21:53,357 --> 01:21:54,090\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1621\n01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:57,020\n>> You know, my loader look like it was a.\n\n1622\n01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,640\n>> Safe and usable boot loader so\n\n1623\n01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:04,535\nthat TPM is just a secure place\nto store that information.\n\n1624\n01:22:04,535 --> 01:22:05,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1625\n01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:09,900\nYeah and\nthere's some Linux stuff out there that,\n\n1626\n01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,740\ntheir boot loaders are also signs.\n\n1627\n01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:16,520\nSo you can start now\na dual boot with Windows.\n\n1628\n01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,970\n>> That was a real issue wasn't it?\n\n1629\n01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:21,730\nA lot of people were not happy about that\nbecause all of a sudden if you had secure\n\n1630\n01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:26,680\nboot enabled on your machine and\nyour Linux distros that you are using\n\n1631\n01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,560\ndid not have a signed boot\nloader It wouldn't let it boot.\n\n1632\n01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:35,270\nIt saw it as potential malware an blocked\nit from starting that machine.\n\n1633\n01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:41,644\n>> So, for the error it\n\n1634\n01:22:41,644 --> 01:22:47,560\nwould throw, let them.\n\n1635\n01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,390\n>> Yes, all the boot loaders\non my machine are all.\n\n1636\n01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:52,400\n>> Sides.\nWe really can't show you the error\n\n1637\n01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,518\nthat would pop up.\n\n1638\n01:22:53,518 --> 01:22:55,550\n[COUGH] So Nate's gonna pull up\na little image here to show you.\n\n1639\n01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:56,560\n>> Yeah, see what happened.\n\n1640\n01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,230\nSo just off Google, right?\n\n1641\n01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:03,410\nIf you did have a route kit or\nperhaps something\n\n1642\n01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:08,160\nthat was trying to load as soon as you\nflick on the computer and it's trying to\n\n1643\n01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:12,700\nload TPMs checking it's signatures and\nwhat's trying to load, and find something\n\n1644\n01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:17,550\nin there that's trying to start that\ndoesn't, you get an error like this one.\n\n1645\n01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:18,930\nRight.\nInvalid detected,\n\n1646\n01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:21,050\nthat check secure boot policy and setup.\n\n1647\n01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:22,040\nRight.\nSo it's,\n\n1648\n01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,190\nthis is what the RA would look like.\n\n1649\n01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:26,850\nI currently have everything safe and\n\n1650\n01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:30,400\ntrusted on my machine so,\nyou know can't replicate it, but.\n\n1651\n01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,440\n>> Yeah, and that's an area you\nreally wanna be careful in,\n\n1652\n01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,770\ncuz that's telling you that something\nhas messed with your boot loaders.\n\n1653\n01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:43,200\nAnd that's a good chance that somebody's\ntrying to put a rootkit on that machine,\n\n1654\n01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,820\nor something that you've tried to run,\n\n1655\n01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:48,160\nsomething that you've downloaded has\ntried to put a rootkit on there.\n\n1656\n01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,260\nAnd that's Windows saying\nI'm gonna keep you safe and\n\n1657\n01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,230\nmake sure that this doesn't happen.\n\n1658\n01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:53,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n1659\n01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:58,490\nAnd there are some root kits out there\nthat, they're called firmware root kits.\n\n1660\n01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:01,310\nAnd you have firmware root kits and\nboot kits.\n\n1661\n01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:04,415\nAnd these guys can nestle into your UFI.\n\n1662\n01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:05,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1663\n01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:08,656\n>> And if you, the unfortunate soul.\n\n1664\n01:24:08,656 --> 01:24:11,480\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That gets a firmwire root kit\n\n1665\n01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,750\nstuck in there.\n\n1666\n01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,850\n>> Right.\n>> Pre-installing Windows isn't\n\n1667\n01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:14,710\ngonna do anything.\n\n1668\n01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:15,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> You could put a whole new\n\n1669\n01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:16,900\nhard drive in there.\n\n1670\n01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,580\nIt's not going to do anything.\n\n1671\n01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:23,110\nAt that point, you just have to throw\nthe motherboard away and just replace it,\n\n1672\n01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:26,670\nbecause it's horrible stuff.\n\n1673\n01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,080\n>> It's a good option.\n\n1674\n01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:31,110\nSo we definitely want\nto leave this in right?\n\n1675\n01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:34,740\nSo let's show you guys how we're going to\ngo about, or where you can check to one,\n\n1676\n01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:39,320\nsee if your computer supports it,\nand two Turn that feature off.\n\n1677\n01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:39,820\n>> Yeah.\n\n1678\n01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:40,440\n>> No good.\n\n1679\n01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,700\n>> Yeah, and as far as configuring,\nthat's about as far as we go.\n\n1680\n01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,710\n>> Yeah, there really isn't much to do.\n\n1681\n01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:46,200\nYou either turn it on or\nturn it off, right?\n\n1682\n01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,490\nSo, if we can through up that Sky cam.\n\n1683\n01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:53,460\nWe'll switch over here to\nthe little demo machine.\n\n1684\n01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:58,040\nYep, so we've got, so\nMike has his laptop here,\n\n1685\n01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,880\nscreen flipped over and I'll let you go.\n\n1686\n01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,830\n>> Well you walk me through it here.\n\n1687\n01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:09,648\nSo I'm gonna pull up my, if I can spell\nit, Advanced I really can't spell.\n\n1688\n01:25:09,648 --> 01:25:10,265\nADV.\n\n1689\n01:25:10,265 --> 01:25:14,840\n[LAUGH] There's my advance start\nup options on Windows 8, right.\n\n1690\n01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:20,080\nAnd then we're gonna go over here to my,\n\n1691\n01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:25,420\nthat bottom one if I can get to it\nwithout my mouse Advanced startup.\n\n1692\n01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,980\nLet me hit that restart now.\n\n1693\n01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:33,180\n>> Yup and so with Windows 8,\noh well I guess we're already here.\n\n1694\n01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,210\n>> Yup pretty darn quick isn't it?\n\n1695\n01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:34,950\n>> Pretty darn quick.\n\n1696\n01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:36,860\n>> So here's my screen that we get to, and\n\n1697\n01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,580\nthis is where I can get to\nsome of my recovery options.\n\n1698\n01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:44,370\nThe one that we're gonna\ndo is troubleshoot.\n\n1699\n01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:47,990\nRefresh or reset your PC or\nuse advanced tools.\n\n1700\n01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:48,960\n>> Oh it is advanced.\n\n1701\n01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,060\n>> It is advanced tools.\n\n1702\n01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:51,780\nAlright and\n\n1703\n01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:55,480\nthen when I get to my troubleshoot screen\nwell we're not troubleshooting anything.\n\n1704\n01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:59,770\nWe've talked about the reset and\nrefresh in another episode.\n\n1705\n01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:01,330\nVery cool features there.\n\n1706\n01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:04,630\nIf you missed those, make sure\nyou check them out on ITPro.tv or\n\n1707\n01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,400\non your Roku device.\n\n1708\n01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,915\nBut we're gonna go down\nto our advanced options.\n\n1709\n01:26:08,915 --> 01:26:11,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1710\n01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:12,260\nHa.\n>> I know, it's like wait,\n\n1711\n01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,440\nweren't we in the advanced options?\n\n1712\n01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,236\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1713\n01:26:14,236 --> 01:26:15,555\n[CROSSTALK].\n>> The advanced options.\n\n1714\n01:26:15,555 --> 01:26:16,707\nSo the advanced [CROSSTALK].\n>> These are the advanced\n\n1715\n01:26:16,707 --> 01:26:17,371\nadvanced options.\n\n1716\n01:26:17,371 --> 01:26:19,258\nYou've really got to be careful in here.\n\n1717\n01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:20,495\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1718\n01:26:20,495 --> 01:26:21,117\nYep.\n\n1719\n01:26:21,117 --> 01:26:24,270\nNow, the UEFI firmware settings.\n\n1720\n01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:26,600\nThat is our ultimate\ngoal to get in there and\n\n1721\n01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:31,908\nwhere secure boot is configured for\nthe little bit that we can't configure.\n\n1722\n01:26:31,908 --> 01:26:32,489\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1723\n01:26:32,489 --> 01:26:33,270\nAll right.\n\n1724\n01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:35,590\nWe'll go into UEFI Now I am gonna have to,\n\n1725\n01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:40,690\njust like when we were working with our\nold BIOS, we'd restart the machine.\n\n1726\n01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:46,310\nHit what, F2 or F12 to get into your\nsetup to work with your BIOS settings.\n\n1727\n01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,390\n>> Delete key.\n>> Same thing here.\n\n1728\n01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:48,790\nYeah, the Delete key.\n\n1729\n01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:52,180\nYeah, you always had to go and check with\nthe vendor to see what the hotkey was.\n\n1730\n01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:52,790\nAnd there we go.\n\n1731\n01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:57,760\nWe're already into it, so\nthere are my UEFI options.\n\n1732\n01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,590\n>> Let's light it down just a little bit.\n\n1733\n01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,380\nSo at the very top, okay,\nyou had boot manager.\n\n1734\n01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:02,900\n>> There you go.\n\n1735\n01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:03,420\n>> So there we go.\n\n1736\n01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:10,433\nAnd it's the first part of secure boot and\nit protects this guy here.\n\n1737\n01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:11,520\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1738\n01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,268\n[CROSSTALK] So I have,\nthis system is set up to use UAFI for\n\n1739\n01:27:16,268 --> 01:27:21,419\nboot and if I get off of that option\nnow I have I guess right up at\n\n1740\n01:27:21,419 --> 01:27:26,589\nthe top you can see where secure\nboot is turned on in the blue.\n\n1741\n01:27:26,589 --> 01:27:28,174\nI can't really highlight\nthat section up there.\n\n1742\n01:27:28,174 --> 01:27:32,980\nWhat else, really that's about it.\n\n1743\n01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,360\nIf I can go down here and\nI can choose enter setup.\n\n1744\n01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:40,161\nand then I can go over to my <<< I\ndon't want to get too far off <<<over\n\n1745\n01:27:40,161 --> 01:27:45,121\non=\"\" the=\"\" main,=\"\"\nsystem=\"\" time,=\"\" dates=\"\"\n\n1746\n01:27:45,121 --> 01:27:50,469\nunified=\"\" version.=\"\" oh=\"\"\nno=\"\"

further out little\n\n1749\n01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:03,200\ndisagreement about whether this is bios or\nnot.\n\n1750\n01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,500\nBut it does call it a bios there,\nfor sure.\n\n1751\n01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:08,260\n>> All right, so now we'll go over to our.\n\n1752\n01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:10,640\n>> Boot menu here and\n\n1753\n01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:15,560\nI can see that UEFI boot is turned on\nthere is my secure boot enabled if I\n\n1754\n01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:20,545\nwanted to which I don't I could hit\nenter on that option and I could just.\n\n1755\n01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:21,580\n>> Disable secure boot.\n\n1756\n01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:22,755\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1757\n01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:24,076\n>> Not a good route to go.\n\n1758\n01:28:24,076 --> 01:28:28,693\nThat is one of the benefits of using UEFI,\nis the ability to turn on and use\n\n1759\n01:28:28,693 --> 01:28:33,636\nthe secure boot to help keep my, protect\nmy system against those nasty root.\n\n1760\n01:28:33,636 --> 01:28:36,245\nSo I am gonna leave mine enabled.\n\n1761\n01:28:36,245 --> 01:28:39,610\nMaybe I'll turn Nate's off later on,\nwhen he's not looking.\n\n1762\n01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:41,880\n>> Man, that's crazy.\n\n1763\n01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,070\n>> That's really about it, right?\n\n1764\n01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:46,160\nThere's not a whole lot configuration\nthat we can do with it.\n\n1765\n01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:49,450\nIt's basically,\ndo you want to use it or do you not?\n\n1766\n01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,780\n>> Yeah, there we go.\n\n1767\n01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:55,990\nThat's it so I'm gonna reboot this machine\nand I am going to discard any changes that\n\n1768\n01:28:55,990 --> 01:29:01,268\nI might have inadvertently made\nwhile I was in my UEFI, not my BIOS.\n\n1769\n01:29:01,268 --> 01:29:04,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, Mike.\n\n1770\n01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:05,790\n>> All right.\n\n1771\n01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:06,290\nVery good.\n\n1772\n01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:06,900\nVery good.\n\n1773\n01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:09,460\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n1774\n01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:15,500\nthat wraps up secure boot as far\nas we can configure the thing.\n\n1775\n01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n1776\n01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,700\n>> And that's the end of our\nsub-objectives for this.\n\n1777\n01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:22,180\n>> We covered a lot of good stuff there.\n\n1778\n01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:23,360\nIt's been a real good episode.\n\n1779\n01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,792\nWe've talked about that\nlocal group policy and\n\n1780\n01:29:25,792 --> 01:29:28,790\nthe security settings that\nare available in there.\n\n1781\n01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:32,370\nWe talked a little bit\nabout the main base policy,\n\n1782\n01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:36,230\nmore about why you would use that\nlocal policy in the first place.\n\n1783\n01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:42,570\nWe showed you how to make sure Nate always\nhad his My Pretty Pony for his background.\n\n1784\n01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:44,151\nWhat else did we do?\n\n1785\n01:29:44,151 --> 01:29:45,280\nWe did UAC.\n\n1786\n01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,330\n>> Mm-hm, UAC.\n\n1787\n01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:48,040\n>> Little user account control.\n\n1788\n01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:48,540\nUAC.\n\n1789\n01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,050\nAnd then we did our smart screen.\n\n1790\n01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:52,740\n>> Smart screen.\n\n1791\n01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:55,945\n>> Can't forget about smart screen and\nthe fact that it started out as\n\n1792\n01:29:55,945 --> 01:30:00,325\nbasically a browser protection to\nkeep some of those bad websites,\n\n1793\n01:30:00,325 --> 01:30:03,345\nthose known bad websites,\nprevent me from browsing to them.\n\n1794\n01:30:03,345 --> 01:30:07,625\nOr at least warn me that I was going to\na site that's known to infect machines.\n\n1795\n01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:09,289\nAnd then that kind of evolved into\n\n1796\n01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:14,610\nthe desktop where we're downloading a lot\nof applications now from the internet and\n\n1797\n01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:18,570\nespecially with the new Windows interface\nand the app store and things like that.\n\n1798\n01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:22,780\nSo, it evolved and\nnow it protects us from bad applications,\n\n1799\n01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,830\nas well, that we might try to download.\n\n1800\n01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:28,300\nAnd then rounded things off\nwith a good old secure boot,\n\n1801\n01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,595\nanother layer of security.\n\n1802\n01:30:30,595 --> 01:30:34,730\n>> Yeah, and it makes Windows 8\nthe most secure operating system yet,\n\n1803\n01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:37,050\nto date,\nwith all these extra security features.\n\n1804\n01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:38,250\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1805\n01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,270\n>> I am loving Windows 8.\n\n1806\n01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:40,430\n>> It is a good OS.\n\n1807\n01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:41,690\n>> It is a great operating system.\n\n1808\n01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:43,315\n>> Give it a chance, if you haven't.\n\n1809\n01:30:43,315 --> 01:30:44,750\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, Mike,\n\n1810\n01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:47,420\nwell that wraps it up for today.\n\n1811\n01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:48,060\nI think so.\n\n1812\n01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:50,480\n>> You got anything else to add?\n\n1813\n01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,060\n>> I do not.\n\n1814\n01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:54,300\nI think we've covered everything we need\nto, so you guys out there in TV land,\n\n1815\n01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:57,850\nstudy hard, get ready for that

01:31:14,390\n>> Our little Lilliputian monitor,\nnow what is that guy?\n\n1823\n01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:15,070\n>> Lilliput.\n\n1824\n01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:18,160\n>> Lilliput is what we got

[LAUGH] >> It'll\nbe a breeze to get through.\n\n33\n00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:32,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, I,\n\n34\n00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,380\nI guess, to start off with, right.\n\n35\n00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,022\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah, all right, so, authentication and\n\n36\n00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:38,100\nauthorization.\n\n37\n00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,773\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n38\n00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:41,504\n>> Really before we, we even talk about\nthe different methods that we have\n\n39\n00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:44,340\navailable, we kind of need to understand\nwhat, what the difference is.\n\n40\n00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,699\nAnd a lot of people will use\nthe those terms interchangeably.\n\n41\n00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:50,079\nYou know, authentication and\nauthorization, not the same thing,\n\n42\n00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:50,610\nare they?\n\n43\n00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,490\n>> Nope.\n>> No.\n\n44\n00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,990\nYou know, when we look at,\nat authentication,\n\n45\n00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,000\nwe're talking about proving our identity,\nproving who we are.\n\n46\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,270\nAuthorization is, is about okay,\nwhat rights do you or\n\n47\n00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,720\nwhat permissions do you have,\ncan you access this,\n\n48\n00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,340\nare you allowed to, to log in to\nthis machine, things like that.\n\n49\n00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,970\nAnd authorization cannot occur until\nsuccessful authentication has occurred.\n\n50\n00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,510\nBecause, I can't tell\nwhat you should be or\n\n51\n00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,660\nshouldn't be able to do if\nI don't know who you are.\n\n52\n00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,260\nAll right?\n\n53\n00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,281\nSo, the first step is, is authentication.\n\n54\n00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:23,851\nAnd we'll talk about a bunch of different\nmethods that we can use, to, to do that,\n\n55\n00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:26,950\nto prove our identity to the network or\nto the system.\n\n56\n00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,830\nAnd then we can talk about the, the rights\nthat we get depending on my user account,\n\n57\n00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,030\nwhat type of account, what groups I\nbelong to, and things like that, so.\n\n58\n00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,380\nFirst and foremost though, authentication,\nauthorization, not the same thing.\n\n59\n00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,380\nAuthentication proving who you are.\n\n60\n00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,290\nAuthorization is then determining\nwhat rights you have, or\n\n61\n00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,352\nwhat permissions you have,\nbased on successful authentication.\n\n62\n00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:50,265\n>> So then what about like a,\na driver's license.\n\n63\n00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:53,500\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> That would be authentication, right?\n\n64\n00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,470\n>> And that is a type of authentication.\n\n65\n00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,845\n>> That would prove who you are.\n\n66\n00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:56,470\n>> Hm-hm.\n\n67\n00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,110\n>> And then you know, like if you have you\nknow, certain you know, classes on it.\n\n68\n00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,025\n>> A motorcycle endorsement.\n\n69\n00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:02,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n70\n00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,895\nAnd that would be the authorization.\n\n71\n00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:06,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, so you have your card,\n\n72\n00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,340\nproves who you are.\n\n73\n00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,105\nAnd then it tells what you can do with it.\n\n74\n00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know like ride a motorcycle or\n\n75\n00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,920\ndrive a big truck.\n\n76\n00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n77\n00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,405\n>> Very good.\nI like that analogy.\n\n78\n00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:14,912\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:15,640\n>> I'll take that.\n\n80\n00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,165\n>> I.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:16,785\n>> I just came up\n\n82\n00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:17,435\nwith it just now.\n>> On\n\n83\n00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:17,965\nthe fly.\n>> On the fly.\n\n84\n00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:18,465\n>> Nice.\n\n85\n00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,015\n>> I know, I know,\n\n86\n00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,115\nthat's crazy.\n>> Witty guy.\n\n87\n00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,055\n>> Witty guy.\nAll right, so\n\n88\n00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:24,765\nokay, we've got that down, right?\n\n89\n00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:28,395\nAnd so, I suppose we can just move right\non into the, the first part, right?\n\n90\n00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:31,250\nOn configure rights.\n\n91\n00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,000\n>> Okay.\n>> Now so, before we got started with\n\n92\n00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,335\nthem, I had a little talk with Mike\nabout rights versus permissions.\n\n93\n00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:39,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n94\n00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,127\n>> And rights are, you assign to, or\n\n95\n00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:47,440\nlike a a system-wide permission, thing?\n\n96\n00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840\n>> Yeah,\ntypically rights do apply to the system.\n\n97\n00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,670\nLike, the,\nthe right to log on to the system,\n\n98\n00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,430\nthe right to change the system time,\nyou have the right to, or\n\n99\n00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,380\nyou don't have the right to reboot\nthe system, or something like that.\n\n100\n00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,470\nSo rights are typically\nwhat we call system-wide\n\n101\n00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,960\nwhereas permissions are over objects.\n\n102\n00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,010\nWe assign permissions to objects like\nfiles and folders and things like that and\n\n103\n00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,120\nwe can assign those permissions to\nany security principal, users groups,\n\n104\n00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,515\ncomputer accounts whatever\nthe case may be, so.\n\n105\n00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:20,410\n>> Mm-hm\n>> I so and, and that's you know,\n\n106\n00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,510\nwhen we, when we.\n\n107\n00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,960\nAgain, kinda confusing,\nright cuz we, and I, I do it myself.\n\n108\n00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,690\nI, sometimes I will say rights when I\nreally should be saying permissions,\n\n109\n00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,363\nso think of rights over the system,\npermissions assigned to an object.\n\n110\n00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:34,379\n>> All right.\n>> And we'll take a look.\n\n111\n00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,580\nIn fact why don't we show them\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n112\n00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,450\n>> Some of the different rights that\ncan be, assigned to a user account, or\n\n113\n00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,670\nto a group if you want.\n\n114\n00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,361\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah, yeah.\n\n115\n00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:43,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n116\n00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,200\n>> So yeah, we've got you know,\nmy computer right here.\n\n117\n00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,550\nAnd, let's see dun du du dun, all right.\n\n118\n00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,820\n>> And as he's pulling that up, you know,\n\n119\n00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,890\nwe'll take a look at some of\nthe rights that you can be assigned.\n\n120\n00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,510\nWe're gonna use our local security policy\nin this case because we're not part\n\n121\n00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,050\nof a domain.\n\n122\n00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,708\nBut we also have to understand that they,\na lot of the,\n\n123\n00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,333\nthere's a bunch of pre built groups right\nthat come when you install Windows.\n\n124\n00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:09,593\nYou get some groups that\nare in there that you can use.\n\n125\n00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:12,386\nAnd those groups have certain\nrights associated with them, and\n\n126\n00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,973\nyou've gotta make sure that\nyou understand those rights,\n\n127\n00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:18,730\nespecially when we get into a corporate\nenvironment or domain environment.\n\n128\n00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,230\nCuz when you add a user account\nto one of those built in groups\n\n129\n00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,670\nthat user then gets to pick up all\nthe rights that go with that group and\n\n130\n00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,600\nif you're not clear on\nwhat rights go with it,\n\n131\n00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,680\ncuz they can't change what rights\nare assigned to those built in groups.\n\n132\n00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,450\nSo if we, add somebody to that group\n\n133\n00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,220\nthat might give them more rights\nthan what we were expecting.\n\n134\n00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,010\nLike we were talking earlier\nbefore the show you know,\n\n135\n00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,110\nyou add somebody to the account\noperator's group, right,\n\n136\n00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,740\nbecause you want them to be able to\ncreate and, and manage accounts.\n\n137\n00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,140\nBut all of the sudden they now have the\nright to log on to your domain controllers\n\n138\n00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,600\nwhich might be something\nthat you did not intend.\n\n139\n00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,200\nSo you got to be real careful\nusing those built in groups.\n\n140\n00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,236\nMicrosoft will recommend that\nwe don't use them that much.\n\n141\n00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:01,820\nYou know, if, if you're comfortable\nwith what rights go with them by all\n\n142\n00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,330\nmeans, use them.\n\n143\n00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,740\nThat's what they're there for.\n\n144\n00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,010\nBut typically, the recommendation\nis to make your own group, and\n\n145\n00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,620\nthen assign just the rights\nyou want to that group.\n\n146\n00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,630\nThat way you know you're not\nassigning any extra rights and\n\n147\n00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,030\nthen this user might\neither accidentally or\n\n148\n00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,604\nmaliciously try to use those extra\nrights and do something to your network.\n\n149\n00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:21,607\n>> Right, right on.\n\n150\n00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:22,164\n>> Yeah.\n\n151\n00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,141\nSweet.\n>> All right,\n\n152\n00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:27,090\nso what you got pulled up there for us\n>> All right so, so here what we

00:06:50,230\nyou can take a look.\n\n163\n00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,802\nIf you want to double-click on there,\nlet's double-click on one of those guys,\n\n164\n00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:53,808\nand pull up their description.\n\n165\n00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:55,054\n>> Oh, check your graphic operators.\n\n166\n00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:57,132\n>> Yeah, sure, why not?\n\n167\n00:06:57,132 -->

one up like you have your,\nadministrator's?\n\n175\n00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,800\nDoes it give one to take a look at?\n\n176\n00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,320\n>> Administrators have complete

take a look inside our group\npolicy or our local policy in this case.\n\n194\n00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:56,365\nWe could see a little bit better what\nthose rights have, or what those,\n\n195\n00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:58,185\nwhat those groups have been assigned.\n\n196\n00:07:58,185 --> 00:07:58,826\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n197\n00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,270\n>> So, all right, right

practice, right?\n\n213\n00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,070\nWe don't ever want to assign permissions\nand rights directly to a user account.\n\n214\n00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,270\nAlways want to use groups,\nwe want to follow that really good,\n\n215\n00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,680\nwhat was that acronym that we\nuse in the Microsoft world?\n\n216\n00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,200\nRemember that

00:09:03,670\nOkay, yes, because it changed.\n\n226\n00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,310\nIt used to be something.\n\n227\n00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,860\n>> AGDLP.\n\n228\n00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,600\n>> And now it is slightly different,\nbecause it changed the, the wording on it.\n\n229\n00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,526\n>> It did.\nIt's now.\n\n230\n00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:13,834\n>> See, it's coming

changed and\nset up accounts.\n\n234\n00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,030\nAnd what it used to be was AGDLP.\n\n235\n00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,430\n>> Accounts in the global groups.\n\n236\n00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,550\nGlobal groups in the domain local groups.\n\n237\n00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,134\nDomain local groups gotta\nassign the permission.\n\n238\n00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:33,140\nSo AGDLP.\n\n239\n00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,156\nThey now instead of accounts,\nthe more proper term is identities.\n\n240\n00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:37,684\n>> Mm.\n\n241\n00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:39,340\n>> Instead of accounts.\n\n242\n00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,740\nSo it’s I instead of A.\n\n243\n00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,710\nAnd then they use the word access\ninstead of the word permissions.\n\n244\n00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,340\nSo now it's IGDLA.\n\n245\n00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,460\nBut we'll hit that really heavy in,\nin another segment, where we talk about,\n\n246\n00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,515\nyou know, best practices with,\nwith group memberships.\n\n247\n00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:55,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And really don't even remember\n\n248\n00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,415\nwhy we got off onto that segue there.\n\n249\n00:09:57,415 --> 00:09:58,841\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of just wanting to test\n\n250\n00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:01,092\nyour knowledge to see, so\nsee how far back you go.\n\n251\n00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:01,973\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n252\n00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:02,693\nMan, goodness, goodness.\n\n253\n00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:03,425\nWell, well, thanks, Mike.\n\n254\n00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:05,050\nI, yeah, keep me on my toes.\n\n255\n00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,874\nThat's awesome.\n\n256\n00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:06,432\n>> Yeah, just making sure.\n\n257\n00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:08,614\nI'm sure you'll get me back soon enough.\n\n258\n00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:13,175\n[LAUGH] So, anyways,\nback to our, our built in, so\n\n259\n00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:17,570\nthese are a bunch of built in, groups.\n\n260\n00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,050\nAnd then here we're looking at\nthe different rights that are assigned\n\n261\n00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,570\nto those groups.\n\n262\n00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,410\nAnd earlier I said you can't change\nthe rights that are associated with those\n\n263\n00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,370\nbuilt in groups and\nthat's not technically true.\n\n264\n00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,164\nI mean, we can come into the,\nthe group policy here and make changes.\n\n265\n00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:33,422\nYou just, you know, lot of,\nproblem is if I, I can't do that,\n\n266\n00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:36,683\nlike if I wanted to add somebody\nto the administrator's group,\n\n267\n00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,913\nto get these certain rights, but\nnot give them these other rights.\n\n268\n00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,963\nWell if I go into group policy and\ntake that away,\n\n269\n00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:45,163\nI'm taking it away from everybody\nthat's in the administrator's group,\n\n270\n00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,210\nwhich is probably not what I wanna do.\n\n271\n00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,636\nSo, best practice says, you know,\n\n272\n00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:51,032\nuse those groups when you know\nwhat rights go along with 'em.\n\n273\n00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:51,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n274\n00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,980\n>> If you wanna do something different,\ndon't change the built in groups,\n\n275\n00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,570\nthe rights that are associated with those.\n\n276\n00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,350\nLeave them there, and just make your own\ngroup and assign your own rights to it.\n\n277\n00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,790\nFrom right here we could go take,\n\n278\n00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,560\nI don't know if you have\nany groups on this machine.\n\n279\n00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,010\nBut you could add a group to one of these,\nrights and\n\n280\n00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,580\ngive them that particular right,\nlike shutting the system down here.\n\n281\n00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,550\nSee what kinda groups you got.\n\n282\n00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,920\nAll you guys are built in groups?\n\n283\n00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,930\n>> Yeah, I didn't create any new ones.\n\n284\n00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,220\n>> Where's awesomeness and greatness.\n\n285\n00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,760\n>> That was on our other episode.\n\n286\n00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,410\nWe made that on that other laptop.\n\n287\n00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,387\nYup.\n>> Yeah, too bad.\n\n288\n00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:28,230\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, right on.\n\n289\n00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,150\nSo then that, yeah,\nI guess as far as rights go,\n\n290\n00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,090\nand now we would assign them to groups.\n\n291\n00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,340\n>> Yeah, yeah you know for this particular\nexam, I that's probably the, the,\n\n292\n00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,910\nthe really what we need\nto know about these.\n\n293\n00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,590\nIs that there are certain,\nthere's built-in groups, and\n\n294\n00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,090\nthose groups have certain\nrights associated with them.\n\n295\n00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,870\nAnd we need to go out and do a little\nresearch, take a look at some references\n\n296\n00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,220\nout there on TechNet, and be familiar with\nwhat rights go along with those groups.\n\n297\n00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,410\nCuz on the exam, they could ask you\na question, you wanna give somebody,\n\n298\n00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,860\nthis set of rights, or you want to\ngive them the ability to do this\n\n299\n00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,310\n>> What group would you add them to?\n\n300\n00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,360\nOr if you add them to this group,\n\n301\n00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,530\nwhich of these following\nrights are they going to get?\n\n302\n00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,230\nSo make sure you go out and\nstudy, you know, look at TechNet,\n\n303\n00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,844\nit's a great resource.\n\n304\n00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:18,263\nAnd see what the, we won't sit here and\nread every right that goes with.\n\n305\n00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:20,432\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, go out to TechNet, take a look and\n\n306\n00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:22,830\nsee what rights are associated\nwith that group.\n\n307\n00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,660\n>> And that's pretty good for this one.\n\n308\n00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,370\nWe get into some of our later episodes,\n\n309\n00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,468\nwhere we get into our server classes,\nwe'll take a closer look at that.\n\n310\n00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:35,170\nAnd, and actually, and maybe changing some\nof those or creating our own groups and\n\n311\n00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,206\nassigning rights to them, things like.\n\n312\n00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:37,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n313\n00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,394\nRight on.\nAnd so then so yeah, so where, so,\n\n314\n00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:43,204\nthis right here would be where\nyou would go to find what\n\n315\n00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:44,270\nrights-\n>> Yeah.\n\n316\n00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,110\n>> Are in, in what.\n\n317\n00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,120\nSo right, they're in the group house\neditor and yadda yadda yadda yadda,\n\n318\n00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,520\nall the way down to user rights.\n\n319\n00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,510\n>> Yep.\n>> Assignment.\n\n320\n00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,090\nExactly.\nSo\n\n321\n00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:52,930\nyou're Windows Settings\n>> Mm-hm\n\n322\n00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,607\n>> Security Settings, Local Policies,\n\n323\n00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,459\nUser Rights Assignments, or\nyadda yadda yadda, whichever one.\n\n324\n00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,015\n>> Right.\n\n325\n00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,250\n[LAUGH]\n>> And like for example you can see there,\n\n326\n00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,690\nthe administrators have the, let's see\nwhat does that say, create a page file.\n\n327\n00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,509\nAdministrators are giving debug programs.\n\n328\n00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:10,666\nAnd so, again,\nanother way that you could study,\n\n329\n00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:15,236\ntrying to figure out what built in\ngroups were assigned what rights.\n\n330\n00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:19,224\nYou could open up your\nLocal Group Policy Editor, right?\n\n331\n00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,290\nRemember from our segment the other day?\n\n332\n00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,750\nWe showed you guys how\nto get into a gpedit and\n\n333\n00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,660\nwork with that Local Group Policy.\n\n334\n00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,450\nAnd then just navigate your way into\nComputer Settings, Windows Settings,\n\n335\n00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,050\nSecurity Settings, what is it,\nLocal Policies, and\n\n336\n00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,185\nthen User Rights Assignments.\n\n337\n00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:34,902\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, and\n\n338\n00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:36,900\nscroll through there and explore.\n\n339\n00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,330\nJust be careful if you make changes.\n\n340\n00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:38,940\n>> Right.\n\n341\n00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,000\nRight on.\n\n342\n00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,372\nWell sweet, so moving on from rights,\nour next little bit is manage credentials.\n\n343\n00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:48,043\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n344\n00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:50,790\n>> All right, now in a, now,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong.\n\n345\n00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,684\nIn a, domain, environment right,\nmanaging credentials you know,\n\n346\n00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:59,238\nwould you know, I guess, would be up\nto your, you know, domain admins who,\n\n347\n00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,956\nyou know,\nhandle that kinda stuff way up there.\n\n348\n00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:02,607\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n349\n00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:03,260\n>> Right.\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n350\n00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,730\nWell, depending, you know, depending on\nhow you've got your organisation set up.\n\n351\n00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,850\nBut yeah, domain admins for sure.\n\n352\n00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,898\nAs a domain admin, I'm going to try\nto delegate that to somebody else.\n\n353\n00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:11,690\nThat, that kinda work,\n\n354\n00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,120\nbut, managing credentials is all about\nmanaging those user accounts, right?\n\n355\n00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,970\nSetting up an account for a user.\n\n356\n00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,850\nGiving them the level of access\nthat you want them to have.\n\n357\n00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,300\nYou know assigning the appropriate rights,\nor assigning them to groups.\n\n358\n00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,210\nFor example, like one or two,\nlet's, let's do a little demo.\n\n359\n00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,720\nWe can,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n360\n00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,350\n>> I want to be able to\naccess your machine.\n\n361\n00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,035\nAnd we're not part of a domain here.\n\n362\n00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:32,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n363\n00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,560\n>> I'm gonna get him to do this.\n\n364\n00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,260\nThis is-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,580\n>> Social engineering.\n\n366\n00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,683\nYou guys remember that from\nthe Security Plus episode?\n\n367\n00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,870\n>> [CROSSTALK] We, we're, we, we didn't\n>> We didn't go over this though.\n\n368\n00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly,\n\n369\n00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,136\nnow we're going way of script here.\n\n370\n00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:45,098\nSo why don't we,\nwhy don't we show them though?\n\n371\n00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:45,874\nThat would be a good example.\n\n372\n00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:46,375\n>> All right.\n\n373\n00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:49,572\n>> So we could create an account for,\nfor me.\n\n374\n00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:54,600\n>> All right, so we're starting\noff then in computer management.\n\n375\n00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,660\n>> Right, and the, system tools are,\nthe Local Users and\n\n376\n00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,152\nGroups, right there in Users.\n\n377\n00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,058\nNow-\n>> Okay.\n\n378\n00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:08,180\n>> Creating, creating a user, right,\nand we have two places to create users.\n\n379\n00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,810\nWe have, over here in the bar in\nthe Settings, Change PC Settings.\n\n380\n00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,880\nAnd here in the Users-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n381\n00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,650\n>> Right?\nWe've got a little button right there.\n\n382\n00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,180\n>> Add new user.\n\n383\n00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,170\n>> Add, Add a user.\n\n384\n00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,837\nNow this right here would be where you\nwould go to add like an account for\n\n385\n00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:26,140\nyour wife or an account for\nyour kids or something.\n\n386\n00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,640\n>> Okay.\n\n387\n00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,960\n>> You know, real straight forward,\nand real easy.\n\n388\n00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,150\nBut I think what you're after Is a little\nbit more advanced creating a user.\n\n389\n00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,258\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right and so, we'll go,\n\n390\n00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:38,811\nwe'll jump back to the desktop then.\n\n391\n00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:39,553\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n392\n00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:41,273\n>> And we'll go in here.\n\n393\n00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,028\n>> Okay.\n\n394\n00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:45,325\n>> All right, I'll just delete this guy.\n\n395\n00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,265\nWhat was that?\n\n396\n00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:47,309\n>> Oh, it was nothing.\n\n397\n00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:50,935\n>> [LAUGH] I got to watch this\nguy like a hawk, man, hoo.\n\n398\n00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:54,130\n>> Allright, so here we go,\ncreating Mike a new user.\n\n399\n00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,230\n>> Easy enough, right click new user and\nthere is certain bits of information that\n\n400\n00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,510\nare gonna be required to,\nto create a user account.\n\n401\n00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,850\nAnd we create these accounts\nto give somebody access.\n\n402\n00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,540\nSays to the machine.\n\n403\n00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,940\nIf I don't have an account, right,\nI can't get access to his machine.\n\n404\n00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,900\nIf he wants to share something with me,\nif we're talking about a work group\n\n405\n00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,210\nenvironment like we're set up here,\nI need an account on that machine\n\n406\n00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,780\nthat he can use to assign permissions\nto me and give me access to resources.\n\n407\n00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,570\nSo if you wanted to share\nsomething out with me,\n\n408\n00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,960\nor give me the ability to remote\ndesktop in to his machine.\n\n409\n00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,680\nSo, if I can convince him of that.\n\n410\n00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,650\n>> So.\n>> Yeah, we'll see.\n\n411\n00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,530\n>> So, how would, so and so,\nI would be assigning permissions to you,\n\n412\n00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,760\nI wouldn't be assigning,\n>> You could\n\n413\n00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,350\nassign,\n>> Rights.\n\n414\n00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,870\n>> Well, both.\n\n415\n00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,860\nYou'd be assigning rights,\nlike being able to remote desktop,\n\n416\n00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,440\nby adding me to that remote\ndesktop users group.\n\n417\n00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,970\nOr adding me to the administrator group,\nso\n\n418\n00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,388\nI had unrestricted access to that machine,\nmaybe?\n\n419\n00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:48,429\n>> Okay, all right, yeah, okay.\n\n420\n00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:53,230\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I got, I got, I got a dollar.\n\n421\n00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:53,930\nI got a dollar.\n\n422\n00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,197\nCould you make me an admin?\n\n423\n00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:56,305\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n424\n00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:58,988\n>> We'll, we'll save that, after,\n\n425\n00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:00,145\nafter break.\n\n426\n00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:01,786\nHopefully got more than a dollar.\n\n427\n00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,245\nAllright, so we've got, got username.\n\n428\n00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:06,305\nWe're just gonna put down you as, as Mike.\n\n429\n00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:07,095\n>> Okay.\n\n430\n00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:10,970\n>> And your full name will just\nbe with a capital M for Mike.\n\n431\n00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:16,432\nAllright, this is Mike's account.\n\n432\n00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n433\n00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,110\nSo and really the only required bits of\ninformation here are going to be, what,\n\n434\n00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,410\nthat username, right,\n\n435\n00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,750\ngotta have that because that is what\nI am going to use to log on with.\n\n436\n00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,480\nThe full name is what you'll see like on,\nwell, back in Windows 7,\n\n437\n00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,180\nwe might have seen that on a Start menu.\n\n438\n00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,430\nBut when you go into some\ndifferent dialog boxes, that,\n\n439\n00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,365\nthat full name is what the computer is\ngoing to be, basically your display name.\n\n440\n00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:38,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n441\n00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,260\n>> And in the description,\nis just for administrators or people\n\n442\n00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,810\nthat are working with those accounts so\nthey know what that account was for.\n\n443\n00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,610\nWhy it was created.\n\n444\n00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,450\nWho's supposed to be using it.\n\n445\n00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,376\nOr whatever the case may be.\n\n446\n00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:49,152\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n447\n00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,600\n>> Password.\n\n448\n00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,360\n>> Is, is required.\n\n449\n00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,130\nSo really, username and\npassword are the only required bits.\n\n450\n00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,660\nRight?\nI don't have to do a description.\n\n451\n00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,080\nWell a lot of us lazy admins\ndon't put a description in there,\n\n452\n00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,830\ndon't really need a full name,\nbut, it's nice to have.\n\n453\n00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,310\nEspecially if your usernames are cryptic.\n\n454\n00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:09,200\nYou know, a lot of companies\nwill do first dot last, or\n\n455\n00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,190\nfirst name dot last initial or\n>> Something like that, and that doesn't\n\n456\n00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,290\nlook too nice in the dialogue boxes,\nand then using them, things like that.\n\n457\n00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,735\nSo having a full name there is,\nis a nice touch.\n\n458\n00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:19,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n459\n00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,618\n>> And then password twice, right?\n\n460\n00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:22,171\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n461\n00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,370\nPassword twice.\n\n462\n00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,370\nAllright.\nAnd so now we've got\n\n463\n00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,880\nthese little checkboxes right here, right?\n\n464\n00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,690\nAnd two of them are, are a great help.\n\n465\n00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,115\nWe've got the very first one\nhere checked by default, right?\n\n466\n00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:32,940\n>> Mm-hm,\nuser must change password at next log on.\n\n467\n00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,670\nUser must change password at next log on.\n\n468\n00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,905\nSo we can set it, so this would end up\nbeing like a, a temporary password.\n\n469\n00:18:38,905 --> 00:18:39,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n470\n00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,720\n>> Then we would sign out of this account,\nsign on as Mike's account, and\n\n471\n00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,090\nas soon as he types in\nthat password he'll get a,\n\n472\n00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,420\na little prompt\n>> Yep.\n\n473\n00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,000\n>> That says you need to\nchange your password.\n\n474\n00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,160\nAnd that, you know, and then you\ntype it in and then then it logs on.\n\n475\n00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,840\n>> Yeah.\nExactly and\n\n476\n00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,880\nthat's really the way\nmost systems are set up.\n\n477\n00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,220\nBecause the password should only be known\nby the user, the owner of that account or\n\n478\n00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,560\nthat identity.\n\n479\n00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,150\nAnd the security system,\nwhatever is doing the authentication,\n\n480\n00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,560\nin this case you local\nsecurity account manager.\n\n481\n00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,640\nAnd not even the administrator\nshould know my password, right.\n\n482\n00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,340\nSo you set up that temporary password and\nthen my first day I come in, or\n\n483\n00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,660\nwhenever you say \"Hey, Mike I made you an\naccount so that you can go check out all\n\n484\n00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,480\nthose high scores I got on Steem, you're\ngoing to tell me what password you set,\n\n485\n00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,010\nand then that first time I log on, I'm\ngoing to set it to something only I know.\n\n486\n00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,380\nAnd then that way you can't get in there,\nand, and log on as me.\n\n487\n00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,250\n>> Sweet.\n\n488\n00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,640\n>> If you uncheck that one because\nthe other two are grayed out,\n\n489\n00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,350\nbecause that first one is checked,\nso once we take away, the user must\n\n490\n00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,750\n>> Change password.\n\n491\n00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,910\nThen we've got the option\nuser cannot change password.\n\n492\n00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,310\nObviously I can't set it\nto user must change and\n\n493\n00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,070\nuser cannot change at the same time.\n\n494\n00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,820\nThat wouldn't work out too well, would it?\n\n495\n00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,810\nAnd that one there, you really wanna\nbe careful with that, don't ya?\n\n496\n00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,116\nI mean user cannot change, but,\nwell, it really depends, I suppose.\n\n497\n00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,830\n>> For typical user accounts,\nwe're not gonna use that.\n\n498\n00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,960\nBut maybe for some service accounts or\nsomething like that, we'll, we'll discuss\n\n499\n00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,700\nin some other episodes, I don't want that\npassword getting changed accidentally.\n\n500\n00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,970\nShared accounts, we,\n\n501\n00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,400\nwe- I worked at a company where we had an\naccount that all the the people that came\n\n502\n00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,520\nin to our center had to use this\nsame account to log in, right?\n\n503\n00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,600\nAnd so when they first came to our center,\nwe told them what the username and\n\n504\n00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,290\npassword was that they would be\nusing to access our network.\n\n505\n00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,440\nAnd what I didn't wanna have happen was\none of those people deciding to change\n\n506\n00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,540\nthe password, and then the other, all,\neverybody else that relied on that account\n\n507\n00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,300\nall of a sudden didn't know what\nthe password was for that account.\n\n508\n00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,990\nEven I wouldn't know\nwhat that password was.\n\n509\n00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,340\nBecause some, some guy got smart and\nthought he'd change his password.\n\n510\n00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,710\nSo we would set that particular account\nto user cannot change password.\n\n511\n00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,140\nThat way no one accidentally or\n\n512\n00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,560\nmaliciously you know ended\nup changing that password.\n\n513\n00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,030\n>> But\nthat's typically where you'll see that.\n\n514\n00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,640\nUsually you'll want your user to\nbe able to change their password.\n\n515\n00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,390\nWe talked about in our security\nepisodes about password policies and\n\n516\n00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,055\nwe've talked about them\nin our Windows episodes.\n\n517\n00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:08,745\n>> Mm-hm. Yeah.\n>> About password policies, right?\n\n518\n00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:09,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n519\n00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,970\nwe want them to change that password.\n\n520\n00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,650\nBecause we don't want to give the bad guy\nforever to try to break that password.\n\n521\n00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,500\n>> It was yesterday.\n\n522\n00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,100\nWas it yesterday?\n\n523\n00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,740\nThat seems like so long.\n\n524\n00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,318\n>> So, it does [LAUGH] it does.\n\n525\n00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:25,580\nAnd, allright so, yeah, we have down here,\npassword never expires.\n\n526\n00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,280\nAnd, you know,\n\n527\n00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,910\nI think that kind of goes along with,\nyou know, user cannot change password.\n\n528\n00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,980\nYou know, [INAUDIBLE] you know,\nI wouldn't want that one checked.\n\n529\n00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,510\nWe want the users to periodically\nchange their passwords.\n\n530\n00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,470\nYou know, for the reasons.\n\n531\n00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,860\nWe don't want old password,\nyou know prep somebody who found out and\n\n532\n00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,900\npasses it out you know.\n\n533\n00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,190\nIf it never changes it\nwould be a bad thing.\n\n534\n00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,140\n>> It would definitely be a bad thing.\n\n535\n00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,210\nIt's really one of those options you only\nwant to use if If you really need it\n\n536\n00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,390\nbecause like you said.\n\n537\n00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,632\nYou're giving a bad guy forever\nto break that password.\n\n538\n00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:01,930\nYou know, I've,\nI've seen it used in service accounts.\n\n539\n00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,320\nWhere I've got an account that\na particular service runs under.\n\n540\n00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,210\nSo a service running on my\nmachine needs an account\n\n541\n00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,799\nthat it can use to access resources.\n\n542\n00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,710\nAnd what I don't wanna have happen is\nif I set that to have to be changed\n\n543\n00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,480\nevery 30 days, follows the normal\npassword policy on my system.\n\n544\n00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,230\nI forget, I never log on with that\naccount, and, and I forget that,\n\n545\n00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,380\nthat, you know, I don't even notice\nthat it's time for it to be changed.\n\n546\n00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,740\nAnd then that service fails\nbecause it's password is expired.\n\n547\n00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,880\nAnd so some functionality on\nmy machine has now failed like\n\n548\n00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,680\nyou know the backup process or\nsomething like that so\n\n549\n00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,600\nall of a sudden I could go a week or two\nbecause, and my backups aren't being done,\n\n550\n00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,860\nunbeknownst to me because\nthe darn password had expired.\n\n551\n00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,060\n>> Well, you'd also be checking\nyour audit logs, correct?\n\n552\n00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,983\n>> Should be.\n>> And that you would,\n\n553\n00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:49,100\nyou would be able to know that\nyour backups weren't being done.\n\n554\n00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,620\nBecause you viewed the logs, and\nyou came in each, each morning.\n\n555\n00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,980\n>> Absolutely, yes, yes.\n\n556\n00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980\nAbsolutely.\n\n557\n00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,400\nYes.\n[LAUGH] Because I do that, I really do.\n\n558\n00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,300\nNo.\n\n559\n00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,450\n>> Now allright, so this very last option,\naccount is disabled.\n\n560\n00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,640\nLet's say, you know, Mike,\nlet's just say, you know,\n\n561\n00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,670\nwe, we, we,\nwe don't really need you anymore.\n\n562\n00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,800\nAnd so to evaluate whether or not\n>> Ouch.\n\n563\n00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,510\n>> you are important here, we're gonna\nsend you on a mandatory vacation so\n\n564\n00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,280\nwe can evaluate your work.\n\n565\n00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,290\nAnd we're gonna turn off all your stuff.\n\n566\n00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,980\nAnd we don't wanna delete\nyour account because what\n\n567\n00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,735\nif you've changed something in\nhow we have to bring you back in.\n\n568\n00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n569\n00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,130\n>> So we don't wanna delete it, we just\nmark the account as disabled, right?\n\n570\n00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,610\n>> Right.\n>> So it doesn't work, nobody can use it.\n\n571\n00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,710\nIt's, it's essentially a parked.\n\n572\n00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,500\n>> Yep.\n>> And we can do you know,\n\n573\n00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,260\nwhatever we want.\n\n574\n00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,713\nYou know, if, you know, if we like you,\nthen we can bring you back on and\n\n575\n00:23:39,713 --> 00:23:41,113\nenable your account.\n\n576\n00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:42,762\n>> Please, pretty please.\n\n577\n00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:43,819\nAgain, I got a dollar.\n\n578\n00:23:43,819 --> 00:23:44,876\n>> Right?\nOh, man.\n\n579\n00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:45,942\n>> I found you a dollar.\n\n580\n00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:47,092\nOoh, you gotta be quicker than that.\n\n581\n00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:47,973\n>> That's funny.\n\n582\n00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:50,697\n>> No, you, you, yeah,\nNate's exactly right, you know,\n\n583\n00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:52,340\nit's a way to disable the account.\n\n584\n00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,360\nThe key here is just to understand\nthat if the account's disabled,\n\n585\n00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,140\nit cannot be used to log on with.\n\n586\n00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,490\nSo I cannot log on with that\naccount if it has been disabled.\n\n587\n00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,180\nAnd as you said if somebody\nis going on extended leave,\n\n588\n00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,840\na sabbatical, maternity leave,\nsomething like that.\n\n589\n00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,170\nI don't want anybody trying to use\nthat account while they are gone.\n\n590\n00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,180\nTrying to break into that account doing\npassword guessing or something like that.\n\n591\n00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,430\nSo I can disable that account.\n\n592\n00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,292\nAnd then when they come back\nto work six months from now,\n\n593\n00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,740\nI, I can just turn that account back on.\n\n594\n00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,020\nAnd they're good to go again, you know?\n\n595\n00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,970\nThey'll have to change\ntheir password most likely,\n\n596\n00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,500\ncuz our password policy would\nhave expired their password.\n\n597\n00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,040\nBut yeah, just a way to,\nto temporarily disable.\n\n598\n00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,670\nAnother time we use that is when\nwe create accounts, you know?\n\n599\n00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,020\nIf I'm working for a company and\nmy job is to make the accounts for\n\n600\n00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,450\nthe new people that are getting hired.\n\n601\n00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,110\nWell we're hiring 15 new people,\nand their, their next,\n\n602\n00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,780\ntheir first day in on Monday.\n\n603\n00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,890\nWell I'm not gonna wait til Monday morning\nto start making those accounts right?\n\n604\n00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,900\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nget that done Friday.\n\n605\n00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,698\n>> Wow, well come on.\n\n606\n00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:49,377\n>> Okay, maybe.\n\n607\n00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:51,500\n[LAUGH] You know me to well.\n\n608\n00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,065\nWhat I should do is create those\naccounts ahead of time on Friday.\n\n609\n00:24:55,065 --> 00:24:56,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n610\n00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,020\n>> And I'm gonna have that\ngeneric password, right?\n\n611\n00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,620\nThat, that I'm gonna set, and then they're\ngonna change their password the first time\n\n612\n00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,120\nthey log in on Monday morning.\n\n613\n00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,500\nWell, every employee that I've hired\nhas gone through that process, so\n\n614\n00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,910\nthey know that generic password that\nI use, or they could probably guess.\n\n615\n00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,380\nYou know, it's not a very strong password.\n\n616\n00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,120\nSo when I create those accounts on Friday,\nI set them all up and then,\n\n617\n00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,400\nI disabled the account.\n\n618\n00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,210\nAnd then, as they walk in Monday morning,\nOh, this guy did show up for work, yay.\n\n619\n00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,490\nAnd I can go ahead and enable his account,\nhe can log in, and set his password.\n\n620\n00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,560\nIf they don't show up they, you know,\nthey decide they found something better or\n\n621\n00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,030\nwhatever, we just don't\nenable that account.\n\n622\n00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,990\nSo that way, they're not sitting\nout there enabled, being a secure,\n\n623\n00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,835\nbeing a vulnerability.\n\n624\n00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:35,951\n>> Mm-hm, right on.\n\n625\n00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,520\nNow on,\non your account I did click Create.\n\n626\n00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,885\n>> Okay.\n>> And it just, it, it cleared the form.\n\n627\n00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:42,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n628\n00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,440\n>> Now you know going through, you know,\nthis way, using you know, it, it, I\n\n629\n00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,940\nguess it's set up to where it's expecting\na lot of accounts to be entered in,\n\n630\n00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,740\nover and over again.\n\n631\n00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,340\n>> And it does the same\nthing in Active Directory.\n\n632\n00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,880\nIf you're in a domain environment, and\n\n633\n00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,770\nyou go in there, right-click New User,\nit's gonna do the same thing.\n\n634\n00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,620\nYou click, Create.\n\n635\n00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,600\nAnd it gives you the option to add\na second, or third, or fourth account.\n\n636\n00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,468\nAnd then you click Done, or Close,\nand then that wizard goes away.\n\n637\n00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:08,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And voila, like magic,\n\n638\n00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,200\nthere is my account.\n\n639\n00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,235\n>> Now, let's say that we did send\nyou on your mandatory vacation.\n\n640\n00:26:14,235 --> 00:26:14,886\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n641\n00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:18,549\n>> And you come back, and let's say, oh,\nthis is a wild time, and you come back,\n\n642\n00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,625\nand we have very strict password policies.\n\n643\n00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,248\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And you enter it in, you know,\n\n644\n00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,450\nwrong a couple of times, you know,\nyou're not sure what you set it to.\n\n645\n00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,562\n>> It's been awhile, and\nI had a lot of Mai Tais.\n\n646\n00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:29,999\n>> Yeah-\n>> I, I, don't remember what I set my\n\n647\n00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:30,571\npassword to.\n\n648\n00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:31,104\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n649\n00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:34,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so, yeah, and so\n\n650\n00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,100\nyou enter it in too many times,\nour password enforcement

00:27:48,130\nlock it again, right?\n\n684\n00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,254\nSo, the more you,\nonce you unlock the account-\n\n685\n00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:51,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n686\n00:27:51,770 -->

00:27:59,670\nCuz I'm getting tired of\nhearing from this guy, right?\n\n689\n00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,760\nDon't, I'm not trying to\nmake more work for myself.\n\n690\n00:28:01,760 -->

Mm-hm.\n\n693\n00:28:06,257 --> 00:28:11,340\nAnd, and so we highlight Mike's name,\nright-click on that guy, and there we go.\n\n694\n00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,660\nSet-\n>> Set

00:28:20,355\nsetting passwords, because, you know,\nsome things can happen in the background.\n\n698\n00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,530\nAnd I've reset passwords before and\n\n699\n00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,044\nI haven't really noticed\nanything severe happen before.\n\n700\n00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:28,745\n>> Yeah, well the problem is, if you,\n\n701\n00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:33,570\nif we look closely at that thing,\nI just can't read that from here.\n\n702\n00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,150\nJust, read it to us Nate.\n\n703\n00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,730\n>> Right, the whole thing?\n\n704\n00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,380\n>> Well, highlight it for us.\n\n705\n00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,090\nSet it up.\n>> All right so,\n\n706\n00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,493\nresetting this password might cause\nirreversible loss of information to this\n\n707\n00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:43,170\nuser account.\n\n708\n00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,470\nFor security reasons, Windows protects\ncertain information by making it\n\n709\n00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,400\nimpossible to access if\nthe user's password is reset.\n\n710\n00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:54,138\n>> There are some things where\nwe deal with certificates and\n\n711\n00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:58,210\nwe won't probably get that deep into it in\nthis particular class, or this episode.\n\n712\n00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,927\nBut you can cause some problems with\nsome certificates that have been issued\n\n713\n00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:07,570\nto the user, that might include\nsome password information in there.\n\n714\n00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,260\nSo you can reset that, or what they\nprefer is the user does it himself right?\n\n715\n00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,820\n>> Mm.\n>> I decided it's\n\n716\n00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,940\ntime to change my password.\n\n717\n00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:18,140\nI do my Ctrl + Alt + Delete, and then from\nmy screen I click set, Change Password.\n\n718\n00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,520\nThe administrator obviously\ncan come in here and reset it.\n\n719\n00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,936\nAnd it just warning you, hey, you know,\nyou, you might want to let that\n\n720\n00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:27,279\nuser know or they could potentially\nlose access to information.\n\n721\n00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,925\nIf it's not changed\nthrough the normal method.\n\n722\n00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n723\n00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,780\n>> But we're okay with that,\nwe don't have anything set up.\n\n724\n00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,060\nSo you can reset my password.\n\n725\n00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,040\n>> Yeah, well hopefully hopefully\nthat the backups have been running.\n\n726\n00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,590\n>> Yes, yes.\n>> Right?\n\n727\n00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,735\nBut we don't know because\nsomeone's service account,\n\n728\n00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,039\nright, is, is, is not running.\n\n729\n00:29:41,039

here,\n\n734\n00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,690\nwe this is where we, yeah,\nchange that password so you're in.\n\n735\n00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,612\nA new password, and we'll click OK.\n\n736\n00:29:59,612 --> 00:30:01,530\n>> Just tried to do a little\nshoulder surfing there.\n\n737\n00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,510\nI didn't see what you set it to.\n\n738\n00:30:02,510 -->

violating any security policies.\n\n761\n00:31:00,655 --> 00:31:02,755\nSo now you've decided you're\ngonna give me that promotion.\n\n762\n00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:04,032\n>> Yeah.\n\n763\n00:31:04,032

right?\n\n776\n00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,880\nWe can go to the user account, and\nI could go to that members of tab, and\n\n777\n00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,630\nI could see what groups\nthat user is a member of.\n\n778\n00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,636\nAnd I can click the Add button\nlike Nate's doing here, and\n\n779\n00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:39,296\nhe's just added me to\nthe Administrators group.\n\n780\n00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:43,883\nSo I get all the rights and permissions\nassociated with the Administrators group,\n\n781\n00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:44,963\ncha-ching.\n\n782\n00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:49,986\nI knew the social engineering would work\nYou could also go to the group itself and\n\n783\n00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:54,304\npull up its properties like he's done\nhere with the backup operators and\n\n784\n00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:59,254\ngo to the members tab, not the members of,\nright, the members tab and you could see\n\n785\n00:31:59,254 --> 00:32:04,450\nwhat users or a member of that group and\nyou could add me to that group as well.\n\n786\n00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,625\nSo now I'm a back up operator\nas well as an administrator.\n\n787\n00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,260\n>>

one.\n\n812\n00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,690\nBut yeah, so certificates.\n\n813\n00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:07,170\nWe start out with a show on,\nlike on authentication.\n\n814\n00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,610\nProving who, proving who you are.\n\n815\n00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,814\nAnd one way to do it is\nthrough these certificates.\n\n816\n00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:16,990\n>> Yeah, yeah, we're really, you know,\nwhen we first started we talked about, we\n\n817\n00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,850\ncreated a user account, we set a password\nfor user account, and now that user could\n\n818\n00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,850\nauthenticate to that machine by typing\nin their username and their password.\n\n819\n00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,420\nSo that's one method of authentication.\n\n820\n00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,240\nCertificates are another method\nthat we could use to authenticate.\n\n821\n00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,940\nWe can certificates for\na lot more than that.\n\n822\n00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,560\nAnd there's several different\nauthentication methods we could use that\n\n823\n00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,290\nwe're gonna cover in another episode\nI believe coming up real soon.\n\n824\n00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,580\nBut using some passwords are probably\n\n825\n00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,807\none of the weakest forms of\nauthentication we could actually use.\n\n826\n00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:53,110\nBecause it's all about that user\nsetting a good strong password and then\n\n827\n00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,810\nnot sharing that password, not writing\nthat down and leaving it on their desk.\n\n828\n00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,820\nAnd not giving, you know,\nother people that password,\n\n829\n00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,620\nchanging that password every so often.\n\n830\n00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,150\nPasswords are relatively\neasy to try to guess and\n\n831\n00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,730\nthere's all kinds of programs we can\nuse to try to crack those passwords.\n\n832\n00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,250\nBut, they're also extremely easy to use,\nright?\n\n833\n00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,140\nBuilt into Windows,\n\n834\n00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,860\nI don't have any extra infrastructure\nto set up, to support, to maintain\n\n835\n00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,405\nin my Windows operating system is the\nability to use usernames and passwords.\n\n836\n00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:23,945\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it's still very, very common, in\n\n837\n00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:28,990\nyour Homefront, in your Soho, your small\noffice and your home office type thing.\n\n838\n00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,040\nWe get into the corporate environment,\nwe are seeing a shift, right?\n\n839\n00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,770\nWe're really starting to see a shift from\nusername passwords, to what we call,\n\n840\n00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,510\nyou know using certificates.\n\n841\n00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,195\nWhich we're going to get into\nsomething called smart cards.\n\n842\n00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:45,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And they are a lot more secure,\n\n843\n00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:51,110\nbecause they are very difficult to\ntry to fake or anything like that.\n\n844\n00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,900\nBut it does require a whole another\ninfrastructure which is gonna\n\n845\n00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,920\nbe an entire episode.\n\n846\n00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,368\nWe'll go over,\nwhen we get into the 7411 exam.\n\n847\n00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,660\nWhich, which might be is too much,\nyou know, I can't do that at home.\n\n848\n00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,100\nI don't have a certificate server that I\ncan run, that I can issue certificates,\n\n849\n00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,430\nsmall office they might not be running\na domain and be able to set that up, so\n\n850\n00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,675\nyou still use your user name and password.\n\n851\n00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:13,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n852\n00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,745\nSo right, so you're, you're talking about\nthis public key infrastructure, right?\n\n853\n00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:22,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So this idea of private keys,\n\n854\n00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,305\npublic keys, these certificates,\nthese key pairs.\n\n855\n00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:27,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n856\n00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,460\n>> Yeah, you know, so yes, you know,\nit does require a bit of infrastructure\n\n857\n00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,370\nto the setup, and you know, and we're\ngonna get into, you know, that in detail.\n\n858\n00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:41,514\nIn, in other other shows and\nthat sort of thing, but for here,\n\n859\n00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:47,800\nright, we're concerned on this\nexam is just like what are they,\n\n860\n00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,205\nhow do we use them and\nwhere can we go to find, to find them?\n\n861\n00:35:51,205 --> 00:35:54,020\n>> Yeah, how, how can we use those\ncertificates for authentication?\n\n862\n00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,210\nIf we want to get away from\nthe username password model,\n\n863\n00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,290\nwhat can we do with these certificates\nas far as authentication methods go?\n\n864\n00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,500\nSo, you know,\nwe'll define a certificate for\n\n865\n00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,150\nnow as just an electronic document\nthat proves your identity.\n\n866\n00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,200\nYou know, when you apply for a certificate\nor when you receive a certificate\n\n867\n00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,290\nit's got information about you just\nlike a driver's license would.\n\n868\n00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:17,480\nI usually use the driver's license\nanalogy when we talk about\n\n869\n00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,780\ncertificates because it's the same thing.\n\n870\n00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,440\nJust like you've got\na driver's license and\n\n871\n00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,735\nwhen you need to prove your identity to\nthe bartender, to the police officer.\n\n872\n00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:27,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n873\n00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,900\nthe places I typically\nhave to use this thing.\n\n874\n00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,870\n>> Or like registering for-\n>> Hopefully, not in that order, right?\n\n875\n00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,200\n>> Right.\n>> Not to the bar tender first and\n\n876\n00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,270\nthen later that evening\nto the police officer.\n\n877\n00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,100\n>> Right.\n\n878\n00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,530\n>> But I hand him my driver's license and\nhe, he,\n\n879\n00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,130\nhe looks at that information and, and, and\ntrusts that that information is accurate.\n\n880\n00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,725\nAnd we'll get into why he trusts it and\nthings like that.\n\n881\n00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:47,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or you know,\n\n882\n00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,450\nwhy the certificate is\ntrusted in another segment.\n\n883\n00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,480\nFor right now, let's just say\na certificate is an electronic document\n\n884\n00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,170\nthat I can use to prove my identity.\n\n885\n00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,090\nAll right?\n\n886\n00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:56,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n887\n00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,890\nif it's an electronic document that means\nI can't put it in my wallet, right.\n\n888\n00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,330\nIt's not something I put in a frame\non my wall, so how do work with it,\n\n889\n00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,280\nhow do we use it to authenticate to\na machine, if we wanna go that route?\n\n890\n00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,940\nAnd again,\nit's becoming much more common because\n\n891\n00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,580\nthe equipment has come down in price,\nright?\n\n892\n00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,000\nYou know, when it was brand new\ntechnology, it was very expensive.\n\n893\n00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,590\nI couldn't afford to put readers,\nfor example, at every machine.\n\n894\n00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,330\nBecause if we're gonna use certificates,\n\n895\n00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,760\nwe're gonna probably load them up\non something called a smart card.\n\n896\n00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,630\nAnd, and a smart card is just a,\na credit card like a card, you know,\n\n897\n00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,860\nhas a little computer chip on it.\n\n898\n00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,340\n>> You know, let's let's do a Bing search.\n\n899\n00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,022\n>> Yeah, let's do.\n\n900\n00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:38,330\n>> So, let's, look for\nit, look a smart card.\n\n901\n00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n902\n00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n903\n00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,410\n>> See how Bing does there.\n\n904\n00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,230\nYeah, there we go.\n\n905\n00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,500\nNice, so you can kinda see that little\ncomputer chip mounted on to that thing and\n\n906\n00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,135\nthat's where the certificate\nis gonna be stored.\n\n907\n00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:50,682\nMm-hm.\n\n908\n00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:52,300\n>> Right, but in order to use that,\n\n909\n00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,912\nthat means I need something to generate\nthe certificate in the first place.\n\n910\n00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:58,925\nI need something that can load that\ncertificate up onto those smart cards,\n\n911\n00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:01,000\nI gotta have the smart cards themselves.\n\n912\n00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,410\nAnd then for my users to use them, I need\neither, you know, if we're using it for\n\n913\n00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,900\ndoor entry,\nthen we need card readers at each door.\n\n914\n00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,180\nIf we're using it to authenticate\nto a machine then I need to use,\n\n915\n00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,040\nhave a, have a card reader\nat everybody's terminal.\n\n916\n00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,060\nBut now you're seeing, as I've said,\nthey're coming cheaper, you can probably\n\n917\n00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,270\ndo, do the one for keyboard smart card\nreader, let's see if we can find one.\n\n918\n00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,527\nSee how much they are down to now.\n\n919\n00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:29,870\n[COUGH]\nSo there you can see a few different\n\n920\n00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:33,230\nmodels of keyboards that have that\nsmart card reader built into them.\n\n921\n00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:38,300\nSo now it's as easy as replacing\nthe keyboards on all my user's terminals.\n\n922\n00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,440\nWindows 8 fully supports\nthe smart card functionality.\n\n923\n00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,960\nIts got all the drivers necessary.\n\n924\n00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,960\nIt's got an applet in the control\npanel to, to manage this stuff.\n\n925\n00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,814\nSo we just swap out the keyboards.\n\n926\n00:38:48,814 --> 00:38:51,165\nAnd what are we looking at,\n40 bucks, 30 bucks.\n\n927\n00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:54,040\n>> [INAUDIBLE] For those guys so.\n\n928\n00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,549\nYeah.\n>> Much less expensive [CROSSTALK] than\n\n929\n00:38:55,549 --> 00:38:56,292\nwhat it used to be.\n\n930\n00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,065\n>> And, and that's convenient right?\n\n931\n00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:01,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When I had to have a separate device,\n\n932\n00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,950\nnow you've got your mouse, you've got\nyour keyboard, you got your monitor,\n\n933\n00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,530\nthen you got this card reader\nthat's got to plug in somewhere.\n\n934\n00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,785\nNow my keyboard is my card reader.\n\n935\n00:39:07,785 --> 00:39:08,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n936\n00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,690\n>> So you are definitely seeing much\nmore because of the, the, the security\n\n937\n00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,050\nthat comes along with using those\ncertificates as an authentication method.\n\n938\n00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,100\n>> All right, so yes,all right, we kinda\nwent into the whole smart card thing,\n\n939\n00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,280\nwhich you know, we'll get into that but\nlet's, let's kinda back up.\n\n940\n00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,780\n>> Okay.\n\n941\n00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,836\n>> And go back into certificates,\nand [LAUGH] back it up.\n\n942\n00:39:29,836 --> 00:39:31,629\n>> We're backing up.\n\n943\n00:39:31,629 --> 00:39:33,955\n>> So yeah, where we can find them on,\n\n944\n00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,430\non our machines\n>> Yeah.\n\n945\n00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,090\n>> All right and yeah, you know.\n\n946\n00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,230\nWell, let's take a look, we'll use mine,\nokay, my computer my computer\n\n947\n00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,310\n>> You drive today.\n\n948\n00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:46,871\n>> All right and to get that,\nall right, we'll open up a mmc.exe.\n\n949\n00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:49,837\nRight.\n>> We'll do a Microsoft management\n\n950\n00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:50,667\nconsole.\n\n951\n00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:58,010\nAnd in here we will create, or not create\nbut add a snap in and certificates.\n\n952\n00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,665\nNow we have two kinds of certificate, well\nhere's, you know, three but we have a a,\n\n953\n00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:07,011\na user, user certificates,\nand computer certificates.\n\n954\n00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:07,837\n>> Mm-hm, and service certificates.\n\n955\n00:40:07,837 --> 00:40:08,995\n>> And what?\n\n956\n00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,415\n>> Service account certificates.\n\n957\n00:40:10,415 --> 00:40:14,945\nSo we can assign a certificate to a user,\nwe can assign a certificate to a computer,\n\n958\n00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,125\ncuz a computer needs to authenticate\nwhen it connects to resources.\n\n959\n00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,640\nAnd if we're setting up IP Sec or\n\n960\n00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,570\nVPNs we can use certificates as\nour authentication method there.\n\n961\n00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,500\nSo yeah, we can assign certificates\nto users or to computers.\n\n962\n00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,240\nService accounts are really just a user\naccount that we're using as a what,\n\n963\n00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,900\nwhat a service can run under.\n\n964\n00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,250\nAnd because you're\nan administrator on your machine,\n\n965\n00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,110\nthen you can work with your\npersonal certificates.\n\n966\n00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,850\nYou could work with service account\ncertificates that have been assigned, or\n\n967\n00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,340\ncomputer account certificates.\n\n968\n00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,560\nIf you are not an administrator\non this machine,\n\n969\n00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,710\nthen you would not see\nthose other two options.\n\n970\n00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,610\nYou could only work with your\ncertificates that were assigned to you.\n\n971\n00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,810\nSo we'll fire up, yeah go ahead and\nchose your my account there, I like it.\n\n972\n00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,095\nAnd add it a second time for\nthe computer, the one I'm sitting at.\n\n973\n00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:03,810\n>> Mm-hm, all right.\n\n974\n00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,865\nLocal computer.\n\n975\n00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:07,630\nMm-hm.\n\n976\n00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,430\nAnd there we go.\nThere, there we go.\n\n977\n00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,870\nWhoo, look at all the fireworks.\n\n978\n00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,330\n>> Nice.\n\n979\n00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,725\nYeah.\nIt's exciting stuff, isn't it?\n\n980\n00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:13,890\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n981\n00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,140\nSo we'll go in, CS.\n\n982\n00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,085\nSo let's look at the,\nthe current user first.\n\n983\n00:41:17,085 --> 00:41:17,585\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n984\n00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:18,980\nAnd so these are different,\n\n985\n00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,745\ncertificate stores, right?\n\n986\n00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Isn't that you'd,\n\n987\n00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,638\nyou call little groupings?\n\n988\n00:41:23,638 --> 00:41:24,226\n>> Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n989\n00:41:24,226 --> 00:41:25,570\n>> Certificate stores, you know,\n\n990\n00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,414\nthese different ones.\n\n991\n00:41:26,414 --> 00:41:29,640\nYeah, I, I guess we can just kinda\npoke in, in, a, f, in a few of them.\n\n992\n00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,140\n>> Yeah, when we get into our more\nadvanced class, when we get into, the,\n\n993\n00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,140\nthe server level classes, or\n\n994\n00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:40,130\nepisodes, we will definitely cover,\nthe, the other places down there.\n\n995\n00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,260\nLike when we're adding certificates to our\ntrusted root, a, and things like that.\n\n996\n00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,350\nSo later episodes, we'll hit that, for now\nwe'll just take a look at these personal\n\n997\n00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:51,570\ncertificates, cause this is all about, you\nknow, authentication and authorization for\n\n998\n00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,615\nour users and our computers.\n\n999\n00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:53,350\n>> Hm-hm.\n\n1000\n00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,930\n>> And, so\nthere you've got where you pulled up.\n\n1001\n00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,895\nSo you've gone into your personal.\n\n1002\n00:41:56,895 --> 00:41:58,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then certificates underneath that.\n\n1003\n00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,020\n>> Yep, and now,\nthis certificate right here you know,\n\n1004\n00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,845\nwe earlier we talked about EFS.\n\n1005\n00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:06,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, you know, encrypting file system.\n\n1006\n00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:12,050\nAnd when it encrypts files, right,\nit uses certificates, right, to, yeah.\n\n1007\n00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,915\nAuthenticate or you know,\nlock those guys down.\n\n1008\n00:42:13,915 --> 00:42:14,820\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n1009\n00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,140\n>> And this is the,\n\n1010\n00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,210\nmy certificate for, my EFS\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1011\n00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:19,910\n>> files, right?\n\n1012\n00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,970\nThat are being used, and, you know,\n\n1013\n00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:26,615\nif, if I want to share that file with\nMike I would need his certificate.\n\n1014\n00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:27,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1015\n00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,210\n>> And, you know, add it to that file.\n\n1016\n00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,130\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1017\n00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,250\nCause one of the things about these\ncertificates is that they a certificate\n\n1018\n00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,010\nnot only proves your identity, but\nit ties your identity to a key pair.\n\n1019\n00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,270\nAnd in another episode we'll go over EFS,\nand how it works, and\n\n1020\n00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:46,070\nhow it uses public keys and\nprivate keys, as well as symmetric keys,\n\n1021\n00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,250\nto protect those files, and\nadd that layer of encryption.\n\n1022\n00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,240\nSo as Dave was saying,\nif you wanted to share an encrypted file,\n\n1023\n00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,810\nyou would need my certificate, because you\nneed my keys to be able to set that up.\n\n1024\n00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,630\nBut that's another episode,\nso we'll, we'll.\n\n1025\n00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,540\nSo he's got your certificate there.\n\n1026\n00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,550\nAnd, and that particular one we want, why\ndon't we go back to that for one second.\n\n1027\n00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,110\nLet's take a closer look at\nwhat that certificate is.\n\n1028\n00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,420\nHe's going to pull up the properties and\n\n1029\n00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,840\nthere I can see that that certificate\nwas issued to Nathan, issued by Nathan.\n\n1030\n00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,400\nSo this is what we call a self-signed\ncertificate, because we don't have,\n\n1031\n00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,580\na we're in a work group environment,\nwe don't have a domain set up\n\n1032\n00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,690\nwith a certificate server to\nissue certificates to you.\n\n1033\n00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,560\nSo, when you try to encrypt the file,\nWindows said,\n\n1034\n00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,360\nall right,\nI'm just gonna generate one for you.\n\n1035\n00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,170\nAnd that's, that's exactly what that is.\n\n1036\n00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:39,360\nThat's a self-signed certificate that\nhe can now use to encrypt files.\n\n1037\n00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,840\nSome certificates can be multipurpose.\n\n1038\n00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,430\nLike, they might allow you to encrypt\nfiles, as well as authenticate, or\n\n1039\n00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,175\nthey could be single purpose\nlike this one is here.\n\n1040\n00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:49,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1041\n00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,720\nRight on.\nAll right, and, you know,\n\n1042\n00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,250\nall right, so, yeah.\n\n1043\n00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,803\nSo that's a, a self-signed.\n\n1044\n00:43:53,803 --> 00:43:55,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, so\n\n1045\n00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,930\nin the trusted root certification\nauthorities, right,\n\n1046\n00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,721\nor trusted root CAs, right?\n\n1047\n00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:00,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1048\n00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:05,790\n>> Go down, and in this right\nhere are what beaks use right\n\n1049\n00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:11,350\nthese what built in sort of\nhow would you say it Mike?\n\n1050\n00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,710\n>> Yeah, well again.\n\n1051\n00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,950\nI don't know if we really want to get into\nthis just yet for this particular exam.\n\n1052\n00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,140\nI wouldn't spend too much\ntime worrying about this.\n\n1053\n00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,050\nBut when we look at certificate\nauthorities, you have\n\n1054\n00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:24,140\npublic certificate authorities, and\nyou have private certificate authorities.\n\n1055\n00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,060\nThese are public CA's.\n\n1056\n00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,920\nThese are companies that I could\ngo out and buy a certificate from.\n\n1057\n00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,570\nAnd the big advantage is that these\ncertificates are gonna to be trusted by\n\n1058\n00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,020\nmost Windows devices.\n\n1059\n00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,150\nAnd that's what that list is here.\n\n1060\n00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,340\nThis is a list of all the, the public CA's\nthat your computer already knows to trust.\n\n1061\n00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,350\nBecause one of the things\nabout these certificates is\n\n1062\n00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:49,759\nthey're only as good as the trust\nyou have with the issuing authority.\n\n1063\n00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,510\nFor example,\ngo back to the driver's licenses analogy.\n\n1064\n00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,410\nIf I, when I hand my driver's\nlicense to that police officer,\n\n1065\n00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:02,050\nhe trusts that the information that's\non that driver's license is accurate.\n\n1066\n00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:02,950\nWhy?\n\n1067\n00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,900\nBecause there's a big stamp from the State\nof Florida that says they've verified all\n\n1068\n00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,310\nthat information before they\nissued me that driver's license.\n\n1069\n00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,910\nSo now he doesn't have to re-verify it.\n\n1070\n00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:16,050\nAs long as he issues, as long as he trusts\nwho issued the driver's license he,\n\n1071\n00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,310\nhe's gonna trust\nthe information is accurate.\n\n1072\n00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:20,280\nAnd it's the same thing\nwith these certificates.\n\n1073\n00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,430\nIf I get a certificate from\nsomebody that you trust, and\n\n1074\n00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,480\nI say, here, I'm Mike, see, it says so.\n\n1075\n00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,590\nYou look at the certificate and\nsay, well who issued that?\n\n1076\n00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:30,680\nVerisign.\n\n1077\n00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,640\nAnd Verisign is in our list of\ntrusted certificate authorities.\n\n1078\n00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,910\nSo now your computer's gonna say, oh,\nokay Verisign I'm sure verified all your\n\n1079\n00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,825\ninformation first, so I'm gonna go\nahead and accept that certificate.\n\n1080\n00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:42,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1081\n00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,100\n>> All right, so that,\nthat's what these public c's are, so\n\n1082\n00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,910\nthese are just a list of all the CAs\nthat your computer knows to trust.\n\n1083\n00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,370\nSo if I go buy a certificate for\n\n1084\n00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:54,400\nmyself from one of them,\nyour system should trust that certificate.\n\n1085\n00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,350\n>> Sweet.\nThanks Mike.\n\n1086\n00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,040\n>> You're welcome.\n\n1087\n00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,290\n>> Yeah, that was awesome.\n\n1088\n00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,840\n>> When we do, you know, and\nwhen we're talking about smart cards and\n\n1089\n00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,710\nauthentication, we're typically not,\nbecause those cost money.\n\n1090\n00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,140\nI have to go out to that public CA and\nI have to buy those certificates.\n\n1091\n00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,870\nThey have to be renewed every\ncouple of years or five years,\n\n1092\n00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,310\ndepending on what they are.\n\n1093\n00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,060\nIf we're doing authentication, I'm not\nusing my smart card to authenticate\n\n1094\n00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,700\nanywhere other than internally,\nright, in my own company.\n\n1095\n00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,310\nAnd I can run my own\ncertificate authority, and\n\n1096\n00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,610\nissue all the certificates\nI want at no charge to me.\n\n1097\n00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,510\nSo now I can issue\ncertificates to all my users.\n\n1098\n00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,180\nAll my computers on my\nnetwork trust my private CA.\n\n1099\n00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,770\nSo I don't have to worry\nabout that issue and\n\n1100\n00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,140\nthey can now use that smart\ncard to authenticate.\n\n1101\n00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,850\nSo we, we load up those\ncertificates on the smart card and\n\n1102\n00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,210\nnow they can run them through their\ncard reader and, and authenticate.\n\n1103\n00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,740\nAnd I don't have to pay for\nthem so it makes it a lot easier.\n\n1104\n00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,920\nOr a lot less expensive.\n\n1105\n00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,490\n>> And, yeah, and those,\nthose smart card certificates, right?\n\n1106\n00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,920\nDown there on the bottom.\n\n1107\n00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,730\nSmart card trusted routes, right?\n\n1108\n00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,940\nSo those, certificates for\nthose smart cards would appear in here.\n\n1109\n00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:03,000\nAnd don't have anything set up on,\non this machine, and so it's, empty store.\n\n1110\n00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,465\nNow, a couple things with\nwith smart cards, right?\n\n1111\n00:47:06,465 --> 00:47:06,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1112\n00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,805\n>> We have this multi-factor\nauthentication thing, right?\n\n1113\n00:47:10,805 --> 00:47:11,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well,\n\n1114\n00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,985\nit's something you have,\nsomething you know.\n\n1115\n00:47:14,985 --> 00:47:15,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1116\n00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:18,010\n>> Or, something you are, right?\n\n1117\n00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,410\n>> Yeah, yeah,\nwhen we look at authentication,\n\n1118\n00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,655\nthere's really only three things\nauthentication can be based on.\n\n1119\n00:47:23,655 --> 00:47:25,150\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> Something you know,\n\n1120\n00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,690\nlike whats a password, right?\n\n1121\n00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,500\nOr a PIN?\n\n1122\n00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,790\n>> User name.\n\n1123\n00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,210\n>> Something you have,\nsome kind of physical thing,\n\n1124\n00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,420\nlike a token, or a smart card,\nexample of a token.\n\n1125\n00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,245\nAnd then something you are, which is\nbiometrics, which I think we are going to\n\n1126\n00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:45,303\ncover in another episode, so yeah and\nsmart cards are multi-factor, right?\n\n1127\n00:47:45,303 --> 00:47:47,763\nSingle-factor authentication,\nusername password,\n\n1128\n00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:50,742\nyou're just basing authentication\non something you know, right?\n\n1129\n00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:54,257\nSo there's only one factor involved\nin that authentication process.\n\n1130\n00:47:54,257 --> 00:47:56,833\nMm.\n>> Smart cards typically have, you know,\n\n1131\n00:47:56,833 --> 00:48:01,279\nyou've got your certificate loaded up on\nthere, so that's something you have, but\n\n1132\n00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,828\nusually we also have a PIN associated\nwith that smart card, right?\n\n1133\n00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:05,740\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1134\n00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,320\n>> Which now makes it multifactor,\n\n1135\n00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,065\nsomething you have and\nsomething you know, right?\n\n1136\n00:48:10,065 --> 00:48:10,690\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1137\n00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,190\n>> Right?\n>> Yep.\n\n1138\n00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,706\n>> Something, yeah, something you have and\n\n1139\n00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:13,857\nsomething you know.\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1140\n00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:15,210\n>> Right, cause you have to know the PIN,\n\n1141\n00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,510\nand you have to have the card.\n\n1142\n00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,101\nAnd the advantage is, now,\nwith multi-factor authentication,\n\n1143\n00:48:20,101 --> 00:48:24,320\nif I lose my card and you find it,\nyou don't know, my PIN.\n\n1144\n00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,240\nYou can't use my card to log on.\n\n1145\n00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,140\nIf I write my PIN number somewhere,\ndid I say PIN number?\n\n1146\n00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,110\nWow.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1147\n00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,135\n>> I write my PIN.\n\n1148\n00:48:31,135 --> 00:48:34,080\n>> [LAUGH] I get it.\n>> And, and then happen to leave it where\n\n1149\n00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,710\nyou find it, you might know my PIN,\nbut you don't have the card.\n\n1150\n00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,520\nSo that's the big advantage of\nmultifactor authentication, is it, it's,\n\n1151\n00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:45,750\ntwo pieces of information are needed now,\nin order to successfully authenticate.\n\n1152\n00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,018\nMake it a little more difficult.\n\n1153\n00:48:47,018 --> 00:48:47,712\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1154\n00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:48,400\nNice.\n\n1155\n00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,075\nNow, so, yeah, so a, a couple places\nin the, our global security policy.\n\n1156\n00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:57,020\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Where we would go to,\n\n1157\n00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,320\nkinda configure the, you know,\nthe smart card behavior.\n\n1158\n00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,575\nNow, of course, smart cards,\nyou know, it, it, you know,\n\n1159\n00:49:03,575 --> 00:49:05,725\nrequires, much more infrastructure.\n\n1160\n00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:06,980\n>> Mm hm.\n>> And, you know,\n\n1161\n00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,040\nprobably would roll out as far, with,\nlike, company policies and like things\n\n1162\n00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,635\nthat would be set you know by, I guess,\npeople higher up, up, up the chain.\n\n1163\n00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:15,470\n>> Mm hm.\nLike you.\n\n1164\n00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:16,710\n>> But they don't, what's that?\n\n1165\n00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:17,845\n>> Like you.\nYou're higher up.\n\n1166\n00:49:17,845 --> 00:49:18,345\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, yeah?\n\n1167\n00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:18,925\nOh, thanks, Mike.\n\n1168\n00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:20,100\nThat's nice.\n\n1169\n00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,140\nSo, yeah.\nNow we gotta, yeah,\n\n1170\n00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,515\na couple of things that we can do,\nyou know, locally.\n\n1171\n00:49:23,515 --> 00:49:26,050\n>> Mm-hm. Yeah. >> And let,\nyeah, let's fire that up.\n\n1172\n00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,141\n>> Okay. Let's do it. >> Let's [CROSSTALK]\n>> Let's do it.\n\n1173\n00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:27,950\nLet's show them something.\n\n1174\n00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,810\nLet's get some exciting\nstuff going on here.\n\n1175\n00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,325\n>> All right.\nSo the, the, the first place, right?\n\n1176\n00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:34,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The local security policy.\n\n1177\n00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:38,800\n>> SecPaul.MSC for you guys that,\n\n1178\n00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,340\nmight have missed that episode so\nmake sure you go check out that.\n\n1179\n00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:48,090\n>> All right and, in here,\nwe've got, where local policies,\n\n1180\n00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:53,260\nsecurity options, and,\n\n1181\n00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,940\nscrolling down, interactive log-on.\n\n1182\n00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,180\nSo we got this guy right here, right?\n\n1183\n00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,465\nRequire smart card.\n\n1184\n00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:03,424\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1185\n00:50:03,424 --> 00:50:06,734\nIf, if we wanted, people to, you know,\nuse these smart cards, right, so\n\n1186\n00:50:06,734 --> 00:50:07,986\nwe've got this policy here.\n\n1187\n00:50:07,986 --> 00:50:10,340\nWe can click enable, and\n\n1188\n00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,592\nnow these users would be required,\nto use their smart card.\n\n1189\n00:50:13,592 --> 00:50:15,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> To log onto their machines.\n\n1190\n00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,964\n>> Yeah, you know, it, it's something\nthat you're gonna have to think about.\n\n1191\n00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:21,449\nWhen, when you start using smart cards for\nauthentication,\n\n1192\n00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:26,273\nthey're obviously much more secure,\nbut, you also have to worry about, now,\n\n1193\n00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:30,963\nwhat happens when my user comes to work\non Tues, Monday, Tuesday, whatever, and\n\n1194\n00:50:30,963 --> 00:50:33,220\nthey leave their card at home?\n\n1195\n00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,310\nAll right, can they log on?\n\n1196\n00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,360\nCan we still use a username and\npassword to authenticate, or\n\n1197\n00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,138\ndo I have to drive back home and\nget my, my card?\n\n1198\n00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,740\nAnd different environments\nlike our military posts,\n\n1199\n00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,870\nmost of our military posts have\ngone to what they call CACs or\n\n1200\n00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,402\nCommon Access Cards,\nwhich is just a type of smart card.\n\n1201\n00:50:52,402 --> 00:50:55,772\nAnd if you don't bring your card with you,\nyou're, you're not, you're not getting in.\n\n1202\n00:50:55,772 --> 00:50:57,630\nYou gonna have to go home and\nget your card.\n\n1203\n00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,920\nA lot of businesses, I mean,\n\n1204\n00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,025\nI don't want my employees going,\nI forgot my card, I need to go back home.\n\n1205\n00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:06,245\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cause they want the morning off,\n\n1206\n00:51:06,245 --> 00:51:07,380\nyou know, or something like that.\n\n1207\n00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n1208\n00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:12,950\n>> So in a less secure environment,\nwe may be, we still allow\n\n1209\n00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,828\nusing password authentication, even though\nwe prefer smart card authentication.\n\n1210\n00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:19,160\nSo, but deciding whether or\n\n1211\n00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,932\nnot you wanna only allow that smart card,\nor can still use your same password.\n\n1212\n00:51:23,932 --> 00:51:24,940\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1213\n00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,235\nWe've got this other one here,\nsmart card removal behavior, right?\n\n1214\n00:51:28,235 --> 00:51:29,087\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Let's say,\n\n1215\n00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:31,705\nokay, so you've got, this,\nthe smart card, right?\n\n1216\n00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:33,350\n>> Mm hm.\n>> So, you, you scan it in your keyboard,\n\n1217\n00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,255\nor you've got you know,\na little slot you put in.\n\n1218\n00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:36,840\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Then you get and, and, and\n\n1219\n00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,770\nwalk away, right?\n\n1220\n00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:42,640\nAnd your computer remains unlocked,\naccessible, as you go about, everything.\n\n1221\n00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,620\nAnd, and, you know, it's,\nit's a prime, prime time for\n\n1222\n00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,678\nsomebody to come in and,\nyou know, wreak some havoc.\n\n1223\n00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:48,875\nAnd I don't know who would.\n\n1224\n00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,340\nBut, you know, it's, it's, it.\n\n1225\n00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,808\n>> Leave your card in your machine and\nsee what I do.\n\n1226\n00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:55,000\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, so yeah, so\n\n1227\n00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,400\nwe can enforce what, yeah.\n\n1228\n00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,452\nYou know, after, okay, one of them\nright here, da da da, all right.\n\n1229\n00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,039\nLock workstations SS [CROSSTALK]\n>> It's a great option, right?\n\n1230\n00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I mean, how convenient is that?\n\n1231\n00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,050\nSo now, we try to teach our\nusers to do the Windows key, L.\n\n1232\n00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:13,620\nEvery time they get up from the machine,\nthey need to lock their screen.\n\n1233\n00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,210\nWe set password protective screensaver and\nthings like that.\n\n1234\n00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,790\nBut if we're using smart cards,\nwe can set it to where,\n\n1235\n00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,500\nhey if you've got to get up and get a,\nMountain Dew out of the machine, or\n\n1236\n00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,320\nsomething like that, just pull your card\nout, and now the machine is going to lock.\n\n1237\n00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,885\nAnd, and when you get back to your desk,\nyou put your card back in, and you're\n\n1238\n00:52:32,885 --> 00:52:36,470\nback in your machine, making it convenient\nas well as being much more secure.\n\n1239\n00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n1240\n00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,010\nYup, so, yeah.\n\n1241\n00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:42,080\nThat's a, yep, those options.\n\n1242\n00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,730\nWe've got a, another spot where we've got,\n>> Huh.\n\n1243\n00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:47,440\n>> Some smart card options.\n\n1244\n00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,780\n>> And I think.\nAnd while he's pulling that up,\n\n1245\n00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:55,080\none of the other options there,\nyou could either, lock the screen so\n\n1246\n00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,380\nwhen they pull the card out the computer\nlocks, but they're still logged in.\n\n1247\n00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,349\nIt just, the, Windows, you know,\nhas locked the screen,\n\n1248\n00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:03,210\nyou gotta put in your card to get back in.\n\n1249\n00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:05,090\nThe other option was just to force logoff,\nso\n\n1250\n00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,496\nif they pull their card out,\ntheir session is ended.\n\n1251\n00:53:09,496 --> 00:53:11,147\nYou know, so, just depending on,\non which option,\n\n1252\n00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:12,300\nwhich route you want to go with that.\n\n1253\n00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,250\n>> All right, and, sweet, thanks Mike.\n\n1254\n00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:21,220\nAnd so in our local group policy editor,\nand, computer configuration,\n\n1255\n00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,642\nadministrative templates.\n\n1256\n00:53:22,642 --> 00:53:23,220\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1257\n00:53:23,220 -->

Yeah.\n\n1260\n00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,880\nYeah and a number of yup.\n\n1261\n00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,875\nNumber of options here.\n\n1262\n00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:34,696\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1263\n00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:37,100\n>> You know, to go through and.\n\n1264\n00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,560\nYeah, I guess, you can configure\nstuff about the smart cards.\n\n1265\n00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,850\n>> Yeah, a, absolutely, explore.\n\n1266\n00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,650\nPoke around in there, guys and gals.\n\n1267\n00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,485\nYou know, for the 70, 687, exam, it, the,\n\n1268\n00:53:46,485 --> 00:53:49,520\nthe big thing is knowing that Windows\nfully supports smart cards, right?\n\n1269\n00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,160\nWe've got local policies that we can\nuse to, to control smart card behavior.\n\n1270\n00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,000\nWe get an applet,\nI think in our control panel,\n\n1271\n00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,535\nwhen we, when we enable smart card,\ndevices.\n\n1272\n00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:01,950\nAnd, and kinda come in here and\nlook around and, and see, and\n\n1273\n00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,480\nlook at some of the different options\nthat you can set, with these smart cards.\n\n1274\n00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,260\nAgain, biggest thing for this exam is,\nis understanding that Windows 8 has,\n\n1275\n00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,110\nhas added a whole bunch\nof additional support for\n\n1276\n00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:19,720\nsmart cards because they are becoming such\na common means of authentication, whereas\n\n1277\n00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,920\nprior to this, you know, it was much\nmore difficult to work with smart cards.\n\n1278\n00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,534\nThird party software,\ndrivers that were difficult to obtain.\n\n1279\n00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:29,673\nNow you plug in a,\na smart card reader, and\n\n1280\n00:54:29,673 --> 00:54:33,300\nWindows will probably\nrecognize it automatically.\n\n1281\n00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,530\nAnd so there's a lot of built-in\nsupport for these smart cards.\n\n1282\n00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:40,690\n>> Yeah, and you know, and so, we've got,\nphysical smart cards, and Windows 8,\n\n1283\n00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:43,990\nright, introduces, this thing,\nvirtual smart cards.\n\n1284\n00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,387\n>> Virtual smart cards.\n\n1285\n00:54:45,387 --> 00:54:49,730\n>> Now we, we're gonna touch on\nvirtual smart cards on, of course,\n\n1286\n00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:52,290\nI feel like a lot we say,\nwe're gonna discuss it later.\n\n1287\n00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,720\n>> Just, just making sure you guys,\nyou know, go out there and\n\n1288\n00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,770\ncatch all these episodes.\n\n1289\n00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,145\nThey're just chock full\nof great information.\n\n1290\n00:54:57,145 --> 00:55:00,000\n>> Yeah, we, yeah, yeah, yeah, some of\nthe stuff is, is, is real in depth,\n\n1291\n00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,302\nand when it gets a little bit eh.\n\n1292\n00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,060\n>> Well there,\nthere's a lot of overlap too, you know,\n\n1293\n00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:08,650\nlike what we cover in this particular, for\nthis particular exam in, in the 76, 87,\n\n1294\n00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:11,970\nthey might touch on\ncertificates a little bit.\n\n1295\n00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:15,140\nIn the 76, 88 exam,\nit might be a little more so.\n\n1296\n00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,320\nSo, you see, this is kind of an intro,\nto the whole smart card and, and\n\n1297\n00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,280\ncertificates thing, and then,\ncover a little more depth in the others.\n\n1298\n00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,550\nSo, just as we go through\nthe different objectives and\n\n1299\n00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,930\nas we get through the different, exams,\n\n1300\n00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:30,660\nand, and the different episodes,\nyou'll get more and more.\n\n1301\n00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,510\nSo you'll see that you're, it'll build up,\nbecause there is a lot of overlap.\n\n1302\n00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:38,750\nSo, start, you know, just, for this exam,\njust learn the basics, and then as you\n\n1303\n00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:42,860\nmove on to the, the rest of the episodes\nand studying up for the other exams,\n\n1304\n00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,745\nyou're just gonna build on top of that\nknowledge and add even more information.\n\n1305\n00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:46,770\n>> Mm.\nYou know, Mike,\n\n1306\n00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,850\nyou have a great way of explaining things.\n\n1307\n00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was, that was very well put.\n\n1308\n00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,407\n>> Thank you.\n>> Mm hm, did you, did you practice that?\n\n1309\n00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:53,243\n>> I should do this for\na living or something.\n\n1310\n00:55:53,243 --> 00:55:56,769\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1311\n00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:58,092\n>> I've done it once or twice before.\n\n1312\n00:55:58,092 --> 00:55:59,078\nOh, right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1313\n00:55:59,078 --> 00:56:01,354\n>> Oh, nice, that's awesome.\n\n1314\n00:56:01,354 --> 00:56:07,816\nVirtual smart cards, it it, it utilizes a,\nthe TPM, we've talked about TPMs before.\n\n1315\n00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:08,320\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n1316\n00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,526\nit takes that certificate that\nwould go on a physical smart card,\n\n1317\n00:56:12,526 --> 00:56:14,677\nand it sticks it in the, the TPM.\n\n1318\n00:56:14,677 --> 00:56:17,421\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so now you kinda need that computer\n\n1319\n00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:21,200\nas your smart card, and\nit could just work on that computer.\n\n1320\n00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,980\nYeah.\nYeah, you kind of a little yeah.\n\n1321\n00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:27,650\n>> I, I don't know.\n\n1322\n00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,290\nYou know?\n\n1323\n00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:33,789\nWe've discussed this off\ncamera a couple of times and\n\n1324\n00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:36,610\nI, I'm missing the picture I think\nwith the virtual smart cards.\n\n1325\n00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,440\nI really am.\n\n1326\n00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,740\nAnd in somebody out there,\nyou guys jump in our chat,\n\n1327\n00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,590\nlet me know what you guys think, if you,\nif you've got some opinions on this.\n\n1328\n00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,240\nI have yet to really,\nI understand what they are.\n\n1329\n00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,250\nYou know, I mean it's not\nthat difficult of a concept.\n\n1330\n00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,750\nYou've got a TPM chip,\nyour trusted platform module.\n\n1331\n00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:56,730\nIt's a secure location to store\ninformation like your Bitlocker keys,\n\n1332\n00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,550\nour virtual smart cards.\n\n1333\n00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,349\nTo me,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1334\n00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,347\n>> to me, you know,\n\n1335\n00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:03,410\nthe idea of going to smart\ncard authentication Is the,\n\n1336\n00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:06,350\nthe benefit is the multi-factor\nauthentication.\n\n1337\n00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:08,730\nThe fact that I've got\nto have this card and\n\n1338\n00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,820\nI've got to know the PIN\nassociated with the card.\n\n1339\n00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,450\nSo, I've got to swipe the card or insert\nthe card and I've gotta type in a PIN.\n\n1340\n00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,390\nNow, if you're telling me you're\ngoing to virtualize the card and\n\n1341\n00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:18,290\nstore it in the TPM.\n\n1342\n00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:22,040\nAnd so all I need to do when I walk up\nto that machine is punch in the PIN.\n\n1343\n00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,520\nThen haven't we went right back\nto single factor authentication?\n\n1344\n00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,100\n>> You know, it it.\n\n1345\n00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,790\nYeah.\n>> I don't know,\n\n1346\n00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:30,890\nMicrosoft help me out here.\n\n1347\n00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,130\nSomebody out there in my, my audience\nlet me know what you guys think.\n\n1348\n00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:37,034\nBecause I, I,\nI'm not getting that one, you know?\n\n1349\n00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:41,680\nThe pin is going to be much shorter\nthan any password I can generate.\n\n1350\n00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:44,820\nAnd it's limited to that one machine.\n\n1351\n00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,090\nI can't,\nthat TPM is only on that motherboard.\n\n1352\n00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,359\nIf I go to another machine that,\n\n1353\n00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:51,282\nI'd have to load the virtual smartcard\ninto the TPM on, on that machine.\n\n1354\n00:57:51,282 --> 00:57:52,025\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1355\n00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:54,454\n>> So again,\nif you guys come up with something good,\n\n1356\n00:57:54,454 --> 00:57:57,304\nmake sure you get in touch with me and\nlet me know.\n\n1357\n00:57:57,304 --> 00:58:00,630\nKnow for the exam, though that it is\nsomething that Windows 8 supports now.\n\n1358\n00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,690\nAnd we can do virtual smartcards.\n\n1359\n00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,950\nAnd it's exactly the same thing,\nsame concept, right?\n\n1360\n00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,652\nIt's a digital certificate\nthat proves your identity.\n\n1361\n00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:09,070\nIt's just a, virtual.\n\n1362\n00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,315\nAnd it's stored in the TPM chip.\n\n1363\n00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:10,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1364\n00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,970\n>> And that's really all we\nneed to know about it for now.\n\n1365\n00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,828\n>> Yup, thanks Mike for that wonderful.\n\n1366\n00:58:15,828 --> 00:58:18,090\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I know, somebody out there is going.\n\n1367\n00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:22,060\nI can't believe this guy doesn't see the\nusefulness of these damn virtual cards.\n\n1368\n00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,240\nYou know, I mean I use them all the time,\nand this is what we use them for.\n\n1369\n00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,000\nAnd blah, blah, blah.\n\n1370\n00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,837\nSo somebody's going to send me a message\nhere or something and let me know, and\n\n1371\n00:58:29,837 --> 00:58:31,710\nI'm going to go, oh, hm, I, I see.\n\n1372\n00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,600\nYeah, you're right.\n\n1373\n00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,625\nYou know?\n>> There we go\n\n1374\n00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:35,550\n>> But until that happens, yeah.\n\n1375\n00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,462\nVirtual smartcards and\nI are, we're just not gonna.\n\n1376\n00:58:38,462 --> 00:58:40,570\n[LAUGH]\n>> RIght on.\n\n1377\n00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,820\nWell, yep.\n\n1378\n00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,222\nYeah, we've got more stuff,\nmore stuff to cover.\n\n1379\n00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:49,345\nWe are going to wrap it up here though for\nthe day, we've got yes,\n\n1380\n00:58:49,345 --> 00:58:52,880\nreal fun biometric stuff that\nwe're going to touch on.\n\n1381\n00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,520\n>> Another completely,\nyou know it's really starting to grow,\n\n1382\n00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,085\nthe biometric area.\n\n1383\n00:58:57,085 --> 00:59:00,825\nWe talked about there's three things we\ncan authenticate on, something you have,\n\n1384\n00:59:00,825 --> 00:59:03,060\nsomething you know, something you are.\n\n1385\n00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,510\nBiometrics falls into that last category,\nsomething you are, and we'll,\n\n1386\n00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:08,610\nwe'll definitely get into that in,\nin a later episode.\n\n1387\n00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:09,270\nLots of fun there.\n\n1388\n00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,910\n>> Yep.\nAnd, tomorrow?\n\n1389\n00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,110\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n1390\n00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:12,970\n>> Sweet.\n>> I'll be here.\n\n1391\n00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,070\nYou guys be here?\n\n1392\n00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:15,992\nYou'll be here?\n\n1393\n00:59:15,992 --> 00:59:16,650\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] All right, sweet.\n\n1394\n00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,200\n>> All right.\n\n1395\n00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,573\n>> We're gonna wrap it up there today,\nand, yep.\n\n1396\n00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:24,398\nBe sure to check out our Q&A if you have\nanything, get, jump in our live chat,\n\n1397\n00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:28,467\nwith any questions you may have,\nand, we'll do it again tomorrow.\n\n1398\n00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:29,767\n>> Sounds

00:00:40,440\nI am Nate.\n\n4\n00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,450\nAnd I'm here with Mike.\n\n5\n00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,630\nMike.\n[LAUGH] Mike with no voice.\n\n6\n00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,650\nI'm sorry.\n[LAUGH] How are you guys doing out there?.\n\n7\n00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,360\nToday we we are continuing on\nfrom where we left off last show.\n\n8\n00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,230\nYep.\nSo this will be our part two.\n\n9\n00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,200\nPart two of authentication and\nauthorization.\n\n10\n00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,960\nAuthentication and authorization.\n\n11\n00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,590\nSo we left off and there are four,\nfour little things to do.\n\n12\n00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,670\nConfigure biometrics.\n\n13\n00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,376\nFor that we have a Lenovo ThinkPad\nwith a built-in, fingerprint reader.\n\n14\n00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,230\nAnd it's, now Lenovo has its own\nlittle fingerprint reader software.\n\n15\n00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,690\nSo, we'll just show what it looks like\nto enroll a finger through their little\n\n16\n00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,985\nprogram and Sign on to Windows using it.\n\n17\n00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:22,970\nMm-hm.\n\n18\n00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,450\nWe also have configure a picture password,\n\n19\n00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,420\nconfigure a pin and\nlast set up a Microsoft account.\n\n20\n00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,310\nSo should be, an easy day.\n\n21\n00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:33,820\nYep.\n\n22\n00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,195\nNot, you know, a whole blazing\nlot of neat stuff to do it.\n\n23\n00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:38,000\nMm-hm.\n\n24\n00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,510\nGet a lot of stuff done.\n\n25\n00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,830\nSo Mike any, anything else to add?\n\n26\n00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,560\nNo, let's get right into it.\n\n27\n00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,320\nFun stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,450\nFun stuff.\nFun stuff, yeah,\n\n29\n00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,260\nbiometrics really is the you know,\n\n30\n00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,872\nkind of not new by any means, but\nit's definitely becoming more commonplace.\n\n31\n00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:56,210\nAgain, kinda like we talked about\nthe other day with smart cards, you know,\n\n32\n00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,510\nas the technology becomes more common,\nit gets less expensive to implement.\n\n33\n00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,490\nIt also gets better, right?\n\n34\n00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,710\nI have a, we, we, you know, some of\nthe early finger print readers were\n\n35\n00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,735\nnot all that secure,\nrelatively easy to fake, things like that.\n\n36\n00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,330\nMm-hm.\n\n37\n00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,695\nYou know, and as the technology improving\nand it can look for signs of life for\n\n38\n00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:18,895\nexample instead of just a, a picture or\na fingerprint of something.\n\n39\n00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:22,305\nSo it's becoming more secure which\nmeans companies are more willing to\n\n40\n00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:23,685\nimplement that type of stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,980\nAnd I don't know about you I mean,\nshoot, you know, we, we have to use so\n\n42\n00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,060\nmany different passwords for\nall our different accounts.\n\n43\n00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,040\nRight?\nYou're not supposed to use the same\n\n44\n00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,406\npassword for every account.\n\n45\n00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:35,270\n[LAUGH] Oops.\n\n46\n00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,170\nSo we've got these long strong\npasswords that we use, and we've\n\n47\n00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,200\ngotta change them every 30 days, or 42\ndays or whatever the company has set up.\n\n48\n00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200\nYeah, 42 is the default.\n42 is the default.\n\n49\n00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,190\nYeah, yeah you are good.\n\n50\n00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,796\nSee?\nYeah, I pay attention.\n\n51\n00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:49,140\nYou know, so\nyou gotta remember all these passwords and\n\n52\n00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,070\nthen you end up writing them down\nhopefully not writing them down and\n\n53\n00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,210\nposting them to your monitor or\nanything like that.\n\n54\n00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,675\nSo I, I like the idea of biometrics,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:00,050\nMm-hm.\nHow convenient is that?\n\n56\n00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,613\nOh, yeah.\nI mean,\n\n57\n00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,013\nwe talked about it in other episode,\nand we look at security or\n\n58\n00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:04,065\nlook at authentication.\n\n59\n00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:05,750\nMm-hm.\nSomething you have.\n\n60\n00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,745\nSomething you know, something you are.\n\n61\n00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:08,330\nMm-hm.\n\n62\n00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,390\nBiometrics falling into that last one,\nsomething you are.\n\n63\n00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,180\nSo I don't have to bring anything,\n\n64\n00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,410\nI don't have to remember anything,\nother than maybe which finger I use.\n\n65\n00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,500\nYeah.\nYou know, or something like that.\n\n66\n00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,980\nSo.\nTen chances to get it right.\n\n67\n00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,590\nYeah, yeah.\n\n68\n00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,430\nWell, you can have one finger for\nyour standard user account and\n\n69\n00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,850\nthen another finger for\nyour administration account.\n\n70\n00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,350\nI mean,\nyou could get pretty fancy with it, right?\n\n71\n00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,460\nOh, yeah.\nBut yeah,\n\n72\n00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,670\nI don't have to remember anything.\n\n73\n00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,840\nIt's not like I have to change\nmy fingerprint every 42 days.\n\n74\n00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,650\nHope not, right?\n\n75\n00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,645\nYeah, hope not.\n\n76\n00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:39,900\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so biometrics is,\nis a really cool idea.\n\n77\n00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,472\nI think as the technology gets\nbetter we'll see it more and more.\n\n78\n00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:45,030\nMm-hm.\nWere seeing it all over the place.\n\n79\n00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,500\nWe got, we got this laptop here.\n\n80\n00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,938\nHow many of you guys have gone out and\ngot your new Windows Windows.\n\n81\n00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,690\n[LAUGH] How many of you have\nyour new iPhone 5S, right.\n\n82\n00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,470\nYeah, with the built-in finger reader.\n\n83\n00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,555\nBuilt-in fingerprint reader and\nof course we've already seen the,\n\n84\n00:03:57,555 --> 00:03:58,640\nthe attacks on that.\n\n85\n00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,840\nBut still cool idea, so\nI don't have to punch in that pin and\n\n86\n00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,880\nI can just put my finger there and\ngood to go, Yeah, and, you know, not only,\n\n87\n00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,265\nfingerprints, you know, biometrics covers\nand there's things, retina scanners.\n\n88\n00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:13,430\nMm-hm.\nWe have things like\n\n89\n00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,240\nhand geometry scanners.\n\n90\n00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,820\nYeah.\nYou know, things, yeah, you know,\n\n91\n00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,420\nit's just something on your\nbody that can be scanned.\n\n92\n00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,630\nYeah.\nThat's unique enough.\n\n93\n00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,270\nI always think of this,\nthat one commercial.\n\n94\n00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:24,950\nI don't know if you remember.\n\n95\n00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,600\nThere's an older, older commercial and,\n\n96\n00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,490\nand I don't even remember\nwhat the commercial was for.\n\n97\n00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,450\nBut they panned through this office and\n\n98\n00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,800\neverybody in the office was completely\nbald, no eyebrows and stuff.\n\n99\n00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,250\nCuz they were pulling out little,\nyou know, anything they had for DNA to,\n\n100\n00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,720\nto dedicate to the network, or something.\n\n101\n00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,830\nI always thought that was kind of funny.\n\n102\n00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,590\nBut yeah,\nall kinds of different cool stuff.\n\n103\n00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,340\nFingerprints, obviously the ones we,\nwe think of they're really common.\n\n104\n00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,550\nAs you mentioned retina scans are cool.\n\n105\n00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,920\nIris scans are another one that they look\nat, where retinas you're looking at,\n\n106\n00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,990\nwhat, the blood vessel pattern\nin the back of your eyeball.\n\n107\n00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,630\nBe a little intrusive.\n\n108\n00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,870\nThe thing about the retina scans is\nyou got to get right up on the camera,\n\n109\n00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,890\nright and for somebody like you or\nI that we wear glasses or something.\n\n110\n00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,870\nI have to get take my glasses off to\nput my face up against that camera so\n\n111\n00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,805\nI can see back in there.\n\n112\n00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:18,585\nAnd I don't know about you if, if, if I'm\ngoing up to an ATM machine I might not\n\n113\n00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,825\nwant to put my eye on that camera\n[LAUGH] That who knows who has used.\n\n114\n00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:24,690\nYeah, yeah.\nI think about the hundreds of people\n\n115\n00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,315\nthat have gone through there\nprobably not something we want to.\n\n116\n00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:31,035\nBut iris scans looking at\nthe color part of your eye,\n\n117\n00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:34,245\nwhich is supposedly just as\nunique as the finger print.\n\n118\n00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:35,557\nCan pick it up from a few feet away.\n\n119\n00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:36,280\nAll right,.\n\n120\n00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,150\nAnd through your glasses,\nso much less intrusive,\n\n121\n00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,165\nI, I think that might be a cool one the,\nthat comes out.\n\n122\n00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:42,290\nMm-hm.\nI tell you that hand geometry one\n\n123\n00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,935\ndid some work with, with one of the,\nthe theme parks in Florida.\n\n124\n00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:48,110\nMm-hm.\n\n125\n00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,040\nAnd they did, that we were talking\nabout the security methods and stuff.\n\n126\n00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,912\nAnd they used hand geometry for\npark re-entry.\n\n127\n00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:55,580\nMm-hm.\nAnd my first thought and\n\n128\n00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,320\nthis was, you know,\na few years ago, I was like, wait,\n\n129\n00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,640\nwait, so did I sign something when\nI bought my ticket to your park?\n\n130\n00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,610\nDid I give you permission to, to store my,\nmy fingerprints or my hand print in there.\n\n131\n00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,480\nHm. Wow. And they're like,\nno, no, no, no, no.\n\n132\n00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,240\nYeah, good, good point.\n\n133\n00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,580\nYeah, you know, that was my first thought.\n\n134\n00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,230\nIt, was, wait,\nwhat kinda privacy issues do we have here.\n\n135\n00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,520\nIn geometry, unlike say a finger print or\na palm print, was looking at\n\n136\n00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,780\nthe distance between the first and second\njoint between your first two fingers.\n\n137\n00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,500\nAnd that's not gonna be unique world wide\nbut for this park it was unique enough for\n\n138\n00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,300\nthe number of visitors that they\nhad coming in and out in a day.\n\n139\n00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,030\nAnd they weren't saving it for\nthe next day or\n\n140\n00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,540\nanything like that it was just re-entries.\n\n141\n00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,450\nSo if you came in that morning and\nyou want to leave to go to lunch,\n\n142\n00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,053\nremember in the old days when you get that\nstamp on the back of your hand, right?\n\n143\n00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:46,180\n[CROSSTALK] Now you'd have to\nsteal his hand to get that key.\n\n144\n00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,966\n[LAUGH] [COUGH] And they even did studies\nwhere in between twins it was still unique\n\n145\n00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,960\nenough for the, at least for\na single data entry like that.\n\n146\n00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,495\nSo cool, I mean lots of cool stuff.\n\n147\n00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:55,185\nMm-hm.\n\n148\n00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,262\nWhat's the other one?\n\n149\n00:06:57,262 --> 00:07:00,160\nSorry, i geek out on this stuff,\nit's kind of, kind of, you know,\n\n150\n00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,336\nexciting technology, right?\n\n151\n00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:06,518\nVascular recognition or, or\nyou know,where they actually.\n\n152\n00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,840\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nYou put your hand in this box and it's,\n\n153\n00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,850\nit's shooting a different wavelength\nof light that's picking up,\n\n154\n00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,530\nable to pick up the blood vessels,\nblood vessels, if I can say that.\n\n155\n00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,300\nPatterns in your hand which is supposedly\nas unique as a fingerprint as well.\n\n156\n00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,920\nMm-hm.\nKinda cool stuff, right?\n\n157\n00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,209\nIt's just very I don't know, futuristic.\n\n158\n00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,940\nYeah, yeah.\n\n159\n00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,494\nAnd neat stuff, you know, as yeah,\ntechnology gets, gets cheaper you know,\n\n160\n00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,310\nwe could find that we'll see more and\nmore of these technology.\n\n161\n00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,805\nYeah, even then like you\nmentioned the iPhone.\n\n162\n00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,698\nMm-hm.\nYeah, you know, it's out there more and\n\n163\n00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:45,314\nmore as far as, you know,\nWindows 8 Workstations go, you know,\n\n164\n00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,987\nthere are like USB, fingerprint readers.\n\n165\n00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:48,780\nMm-hm.\n\n166\n00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,995\nYou know things of that sort that, that,\nyou know, you can attach on to your,\n\n167\n00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:55,980\nyour work stations,\nstandalone machines and that sort.\n\n168\n00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,960\nMm-hm, Yeah, some laptops including\nthis one has a built-in and...\n\n169\n00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,010\nYeah, keyboards that have them built in,\nmice that have 'em built in.\n\n170\n00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,040\nThat's pretty convenient, right,\n'cause your hand is already there.\n\n171\n00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,890\nThat would be a convenient\nplace to put it.\n\n172\n00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,035\nIt is a nice place to put it, right?\n\n173\n00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:12,870\nMm.\nAnd what we really need to know,\n\n174\n00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,830\nI mean, for this particular exam\n\n175\n00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,990\nthey're not gonna go into details on all\nthe different types of biometric devices.\n\n176\n00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,120\nAnd how things work per se.\n\n177\n00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,205\nBut what we need to understand is, that\nWindows 8 supports the biometric devices.\n\n178\n00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,360\nMm-hm.\nWhen you add a biometric device to your\n\n179\n00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,750\nWindows 8 machine,\nyou should [LAUGH] get a new applet\n\n180\n00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,110\ninside your control panel called biometric\ndevices, and allow you to control them.\n\n181\n00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,370\nNow which, what we'll show,\nwe're gonna show you here in a minute.\n\n182\n00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,910\nThe Lenovo has or [INAUDIBLE],\nI don't know if this is a Lenovo or\n\n183\n00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,470\njust a ThinkPad.\n\n184\n00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,930\nOr, but anyway.\n\n185\n00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,690\nIt has its own software to manage\nthe built-in biometric device.\n\n186\n00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,380\nSo we don't get to see the actual\nbuilt-in Windows applet that comes up.\n\n187\n00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,865\nWe might be able to throw you a screenshot\nup here or something like that.\n\n188\n00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:03,020\nBut if that device was a,\nan external device.\n\n189\n00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,240\nThat you just went up to\nthe local electronics store and\n\n190\n00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880\npicked up a fingerprint scanner and\nplug it in your machine,\n\n191\n00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080\nWindows is going to detect that and\nhave drivers that it can use.\n\n192\n00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,690\nThat's the thing,\n\n193\n00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,150\nis it's got built in drivers now to\nsupport those biometric devices.\n\n194\n00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,070\nSo even if you didn't\nhave the software yet,\n\n195\n00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,890\nusually we want to download\nthe drivers from the manufacturer and\n\n196\n00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,900\nget their custom software that's designed\nfor their device, but if I didn't want to,\n\n197\n00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,775\nWindows has device, drivers built-in,\nto support these biometric devices.\n\n198\n00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:30,400\nMm-hm.\n\n199\n00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,480\nVery, very cool stuff.\n\n200\n00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,080\nYeah, you know what?\n\n201\n00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,523\nI just did a, a quick little,\na Bing search on here.\n\n202\n00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:37,129\nMm-hm.\n\n203\n00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:40,058\nOops, it's actually Google search.\n\n204\n00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:41,959\n[LAUGH] Well, for a that applets.\n\n205\n00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:46,872\nMm-hm.\nAnd you were just mentioning on here, and\n\n206\n00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:49,556\nin here, oh wait [SOUND].\n\n207\n00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,264\nWhats funny?\n\n208\n00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:53,339\nYou have to be careful when\nyou do these searches,\n\n209\n00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:58,040\nyou want to preview the results before\nyou throw them up on the screen there.\n\n210\n00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,030\nAlright, sorry, I did not start up\nmy little screen capture thing.\n\n211\n00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,751\nAnd it will just take a second.\n\n212\n00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:06,680\nYeah.\n\n213\n00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,440\nNow I don't think I am connected either,\nso\n\n214\n00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,665\nwe will wait for\noops I think you just said you are.\n\n215\n00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:13,190\nYep.\nGetting the signal for the director.\n\n216\n00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,700\nWe are connected.\n\n217\n00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,680\nAlright here we go.\n\n218\n00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,570\nSo a quick little Google search and\nfor that applet Aha.\n\n219\n00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,010\nAnd when I search in there there\nis a Windows 8 right there.\n\n220\n00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,030\nNice.\nLet's see if we can get that a,\n\n221\n00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,980\nlittle bit bigger, all right so\n\n222\n00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,520\nthere is that Control Panel applet.\n\n223\n00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,952\nMike was talking about just before\nthe show we, this one has it built in.\n\n224\n00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:48,490\nWe have, we still have the Lenovo drivers\nfor it and it kept prompting its own\n\n225\n00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,700\ncontrol configuration panel we're\ntrying to pull up that control.\n\n226\n00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,690\nWe're trying to get rid of that yeah so\nwe can make Windows use its drivers.\n\n227\n00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,940\nYeah but,\nyea just kept defaulting to that.\n\n228\n00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,780\nWhatever works.\n\n229\n00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,950\nWhich, which is a good thing.\n\n230\n00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,740\nIt works fine.\n\n231\n00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,650\nYou want that.\n\n232\n00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,560\nYou go to windows updates and windows\nknows that IBM has made a driver for\n\n233\n00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,475\nit and it's gonna provide that to you so.\n\n234\n00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:13,300\nMm-hm.\n\n235\n00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,040\nBut if the device was,\ndid not have something like that or\n\n236\n00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,660\na driver available through\nWindows we know we could use it.\n\n237\n00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,030\nAnd as you can see in that window there\nit's the for the exam control panel,\n\n238\n00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,580\nhardware and sound category,\nand then biometric devices.\n\n239\n00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,110\nMm-hm.\nAnd then that's where we can get to that.\n\n240\n00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,130\nAnd then you'll see whatever,\n\n241\n00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,640\nyou should see whatever devices\nyou have plugged in there.\n\n242\n00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,650\nMm-hm.\n\n243\n00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,860\nYeah, Mike, let's show just\nthe experience of just logging on- Okay.\n\n244\n00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,060\nUsing a fingerprint reader on this,\nLenovo ,- Sounds cool.\n\n245\n00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,380\ncomputer here.\nYou guys want to see it?\n\n246\n00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,470\nI knew you guys did.\n\n247\n00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,880\nAll right.\nNow, I have not set up my fingerprint\n\n248\n00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,960\nbeforehand, and so we'll run through\ntheir little wizard and set that guy up.\n\n249\n00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,390\nLet me get that started biometric.\n\n250\n00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,490\nWe'll pull our skycam here in a second,\nlet you guys see what he's doing here.\n\n251\n00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,473\nThere it is.\n\n252\n00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:08,160\nAll right and we'll see, so\nwe will enroll this fingerprint in here.\n\n253\n00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,310\nAll right and then we'll pick\nwhich finger that we want to do.\n\n254\n00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,234\nWe'll just use that finger.\n\n255\n00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:20,357\nYes use that finger.\n\n256\n00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:21,527\nUh-oh.\n\n257\n00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:25,752\nAh-ha.\n[MUSIC]\n\n258\n00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:28,120\nThat one.\nCannot enroll user details.\n\n259\n00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,740\nHm.\n\n260\n00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,980\nThey need a reboot?\n\n261\n00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,405\nWe did again we did try to uninstall this\nsoftware to use the built in Windows,\n\n262\n00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,740\napplet and that might have\n\n263\n00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,400\nyou might need a reboot to get it\nto work there so we'll see here.\n\n264\n00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,590\nWe'll give it a second and tell you what.\n\n265\n00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,240\nLet me connect over while\nhe's working on that.\n\n266\n00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:58,920\nWhere is my IVGA which one can\nI hook up to, there, Mr. Jason?\n\n267\n00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,643\nI'm on.\nDos?\n\n268\n00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:04,580\nI'm on two, this one is on one,you\ncan take, you can take whichever.\n\n269\n00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,535\nThat one's on one, then I'll take two.\n\n270\n00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,320\nOkay.\n\n271\n00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,190\nAnd we'll see if at least,\n\n272\n00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,450\nI can show you guys a couple of other\nthings, while we're taking a look at that.\n\n273\n00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,080\nSo we're not sitting here waiting for us.\n\n274\n00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,550\nYou see me now?\n\n275\n00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,110\nCan you hear me now?\n\n276\n00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,208\nOh I'll probably get sued for\n\n277\n00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:24,130\nthat now [LAUGH] So all I did\nhere was I did a quick search for\n\n278\n00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,930\nlike there's if you've never seen these\nhand geometry type scanners here.\n\n279\n00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,540\nI don't know if you can flip over to\nmine or if I got hooked up there right.\n\n280\n00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,280\nThere you go Jason.\n\n281\n00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,620\nUp, there we go perfect, so\nyou can see it's just a little box.\n\n282\n00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,040\nIt's got some pins in there,\n\n283\n00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,680\nsome, that kinda guides you where\nyou're supposed to place your fingers.\n\n284\n00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,420\nHm.\nAnd\n\n285\n00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,300\nthen you can see that it's very intrusive,\nright?\n\n286\n00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,350\nIt's not a painful thing [LAUGH],\nor anything like that.\n\n287\n00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,890\nYou're like, wait, do I have Stick\nmy hand inside this dark box,\n\n288\n00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:56,260\nand what was it Dune where they had\nto put their hand into that box?\n\n289\n00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,220\nBut yeah, so any way, very easy to use,\nyou stick that maybe at the doorways to\n\n290\n00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,630\nget into the secure part of your facility,\nnot really something I would use\n\n291\n00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,400\nto log on to a machine or anything like\nthat but that's a, a nice little thing.\n\n292\n00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,930\nAnd if we do a look for,\nwhat's another one we were talking about?\n\n293\n00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,020\nRetina and iris?\n\n294\n00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,650\nRetina scans and iris scans.\n\n295\n00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,464\nLet's do iris.\n\n296\n00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:22,647\n[SOUND] Let me take a peek at iris scans.\n\n297\n00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,420\nScanners, yeah,\nnot really going to show me a whole lot.\n\n298\n00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,670\nProbably going to show me a clip\nof NCIS or something like that.\n\n299\n00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,060\n[LAUGH] But,\n\n300\n00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,870\nwe can see that they're not putting\ntheir eye right up against that camera.\n\n301\n00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:41,160\nWith the retina scanner here, they\nare putting it right up against that guy.\n\n302\n00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,580\nAnd then for fingerprint scanners I mean\nthey come in all different shapes and\n\n303\n00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,600\nsizes like I said.\n\n304\n00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,320\nLet's see if we can do one.\n\n305\n00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,656\nLet's go find a mouse.\n\n306\n00:14:48,656 --> 00:14:51,023\nMouse.\n\n307\n00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,870\nMm-hm-mm.\n\n308\n00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,650\nThere we go.\n\n309\n00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,270\nNice.\nSo\n\n310\n00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,220\nyeah there's a couple mice that have as\nyou can see that shows up a little better\n\n311\n00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,920\nsince it's not black.\n\n312\n00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,910\nBut you can see there it's got that\nscanner built right into it so\n\n313\n00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,100\nyou sit down at your machine, you dump\nyour finger on there, you log in and\n\n314\n00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,060\nyou're right to work.\n\n315\n00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,310\nOr it could be more of an external device\nmaybe something like this that plugs\n\n316\n00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,300\nin and be a usb and sits off to\nthe side or something like that.\n\n317\n00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,490\nBut I always though one less\ndevice is a good thing right?\n\n318\n00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,090\nIf, if I can have a multi function device\nif my mouse is also my scanner, or\n\n319\n00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,050\nmy keyboard, that's just one less thing\nthat I gotta have hanging out on my desk.\n\n320\n00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,300\nAnd give me more room for other stuff.\n\n321\n00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,340\nMm hm.\n\n322\n00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,522\nSo.\nAlright, we got.\n\n323\n00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:42,180\nSo we reinstalled the fingerprint\ndriver for this machine.\n\n324\n00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,090\nAnd it's rebooting.\n\n325\n00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,140\nIt will take a little a bit Don on this,\nLenovo.\n\n326\n00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,870\nIt runs Windows seven.\n\n327\n00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,690\nMm hm.\nAnd to it.\n\n328\n00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,290\nAnd so,\nwe've got a little external USB drive.\n\n329\n00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,392\nThat we're running Windows to go onto it.\n\n330\n00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:58,043\nNice.\n\n331\n00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:02,175\nAnd it so it'll take a few minutes for\nthis guy to boot up and start going.\n\n332\n00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,563\nHave we done our Windows\nto go episode yet?\n\n333\n00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,809\nWe,we haven't.\n\n334\n00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,285\nWait until we

he's\ngot Windows 7 installed on it,\n\n338\n00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,230\nwe take a USB drive that's got\nWindows 8 Installed on it, plug it in,\n\n339\n00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,165\nreboot the machine and\nboot to the external drive.\n\n340\n00:16:20,165 --> 00:16:22,650\nMm-hm.\nWhen your done you take it with you.\n\n341\n00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,025\nHence the name Windows to go,

don't want you enrolling your\nfingerprint on, on my machine.\n\n347\n00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,690\nAnd it's like wait, it's like no\ndon't worry we'll use Windows to go,\n\n348\n00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,570\noh you know, in your hard drive, you know\nwe wont mess with anything on there,\n\n349\n00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,590\nand real real awesome.\n\n350\n00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,100\nI

we'll pull that\noverhead camera back up.\n\n356\n00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,030\nTake a look at this finger\nprint enrollment process,\n\n357\n00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,160\nsee if it's going to work.\n\n358\n00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,660\nMm-hm.\n\n359\n00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,600\nFind out here Alright.\n\n360\n00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,510\nSo, I don't wanna go too flat,\nand get any glare on that.\n\n361\n00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,030\nAll right.\n\n362\n00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,484\nLet's, for that, we'll- You want me to\njust put my fingerprint on the screen?\n\n363\n00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:11,656\n[LAUGH] My.\n\n364\n00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:16,350\n[LAUGH] I thought you just put your hand\nover the screen there, and it logs you in.\n\n365\n00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,625\nI don't understand that.\n\n366\n00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:23,120\n[LAUGH] Alright, so he's going into his,\nsearch Is there on Windows eight.\n\n367\n00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,210\nPulled up by ometics.\n\n368\n00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,190\nAnd eventually it will pop up that screen.\n\n369\n00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,050\nAnd will give us a chance to\nhopefully enroll a finger.\n\n370\n00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,920\nAnd that's all we're doing.\n\n371\n00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,700\nIs what you gotta do.\n\n372\n00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,040\nIt just like, when you set your\npassword for your account.\n\n373\n00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,800\nHm.\nHere, if you want\n\n374\n00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,870\nto use your fingerprint to log in.\n\n375\n00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,090\nThen it's gotta have a copy\nof your fingerprint.\n\n376\n00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,110\nSo that when I go to log in I scan\nmy finger, it's gonna compare it\n\n377\n00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,730\nagainst the image that it has in\nplace that I stored earlier, and\n\n378\n00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,050\nif those match,\nthen it assumes it must be me.\n\n379\n00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,020\nSomebody else swipes their finger,\nit's not gonna match the image that\n\n380\n00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,900\nI've stored, and\nit's not gonna let them log in.\n\n381\n00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,510\nThat's the idea, anyway.\n\n382\n00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,600\n[CROSSTALK] Sorry,\nI didn't mean to cut you off.\n\n383\n00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,880\nAlright, we're up.\n\n384\n00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,220\nIt did remember my finger\nprint from last time.\n\n385\n00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,810\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nenroll a new one and, let's see.\n\n386\n00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,490\nSo we'll just- So, this one looks like\nit's going to make you do it three times.\n\n387\n00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,360\nJust to, almost like when you enter your\npassword in twice to make sure you typed\n\n388\n00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,510\nit in correctly.\n\n389\n00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,880\nThis one makes you do it three times to\nmake sure it's got a good clean image of\n\n390\n00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,640\nyour fingerprint that it's\ngoing to be able to read.\n\n391\n00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,120\nSome of these newer ones make you do your\nfingerprint from different angles, so\n\n392\n00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,040\nwhen you go to put your finger on that\nscanner, if you're on a slightly different\n\n393\n00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,230\nangle it can still detect that it's your\nfingerprint and allow you to log in.\n\n394\n00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,490\nAlright so we'll go ahead and\nlock this computer.\n\n395\n00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,120\nYeah let's zoom out a little bit so\n\n396\n00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,940\nwe can see the scanner down there\nwhere you have to put your finger.\n\n397\n00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,880\nAlright, yeah There.\n\n398\n00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,410\nJust don't knock over my Mountain Dew.\n\n399\n00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,020\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] All right,\n\n400\n00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,245\nseriously though,\nyou have a Lenovo Think Pad.\n\n401\n00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:55,280\nUm-hm.\n\n402\n00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,560\nAnd it's sensor's here,\nright down here, this little guy.\n\n403\n00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,470\nAnd, and goodness sakes,\nit's just a little flat bar thing.\n\n404\n00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,175\nIt's kinda different from what you expect,\nright?\n\n405\n00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:05,060\nUm-hm.\nYou, you expect a,\n\n406\n00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,260\na square where you put your\nwhole finger on it and\n\n407\n00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,430\nit takes a picture of\nthe finger at one time.\n\n408\n00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,030\nThis one's a little different,\nwhere it's gonna.\n\n409\n00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,880\nMm, yeah,\nyou just set your finger on it and\n\n410\n00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,620\nyou just kinda roll\npast it as it scans it.\n\n411\n00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,860\nAlmost like a, yeah,\nthat's what I was thinking,\n\n412\n00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,340\nlike a flat-bed scanner that we\nused to use or something like that.\n\n413\n00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,860\nMm-hm, yeah, and simple enough.\n\n414\n00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,300\nSo we'll go in there and, and as, it,\nit just prompts right there Mm-hm.\n\n415\n00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,050\nSwipe your finger for\nthe fingerprint logon, and\n\n416\n00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,930\nI will just run my finger over that.\n\n417\n00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,860\nAnd there it goes.\n\n418\n00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,900\nWow.\nAnd it works.\n\n419\n00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,740\nImpressive.\n\n420\n00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,530\nYep, well, you know You know different\nfinger print readers will have you know\n\n421\n00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,070\nthe Can you log off.\n\n422\n00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,990\nWhat's that?\n\n423\n00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,760\nCan you log off with the finger print or\njust log on, on this one?\n\n424\n00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,820\nJust if you lock the screen or\nanything like that I was just curious.\n\n425\n00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,580\nAlright, I'm sure we could\nset it through policy.\n\n426\n00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,800\nYou wanna see what,\nwell let's go ahead and log it off.\n\n427\n00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,570\nand let's see what happens\nwhen we use my finger.\n\n428\n00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,280\nAlright, yeah.\n\n429\n00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,290\nMike that's getting crazy.\n\n430\n00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:58,920\nYeah, I know right.\n\n431\n00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,310\nWell we got to know if\nthis stuff is secure.\n\n432\n00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,280\nWe want to make sure it works.\n\n433\n00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,930\nAlright there we go.\n\n434\n00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,910\nAlright now I'm going to step over here,\ntrip over the cables, and scan my finger.\n\n435\n00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520\nNo match.\n\n436\n00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,390\nWhat if I use this finger?\n\n437\n00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,770\nNo match.\n\n438\n00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,980\nSo my fingerprint is evidently not\nthe same Same as Nate, surprise, surprise.\n\n439\n00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,580\nAnd Nate walks over there and booya.\n\n440\n00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,360\nNice.\n\n441\n00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,000\nNice.\n\n442\n00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,055\nAlright, sweet.\n\n443\n00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,220\n[COUGH] That, alright, so that's that.\n\n444\n00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,970\nFinger print reader.\n\n445\n00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,470\nAlright.\n\n446\n00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,790\nAlright, you know what,\nwe have some time left.\n\n447\n00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,205\nMm, hm.\nLet let's take a look at,\n\n448\n00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:37,860\num,creating a, a picture password.\n\n449\n00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,115\nThat's another way we can log on, right?\n\n450\n00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,770\nMm-hm.\nI mean, a few years ago,\n\n451\n00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,790\nall we had was password.\n\n452\n00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,650\nI mean, that was it.\n\n453\n00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,090\nThere was no choices that I could make.\n\n454\n00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:50,165\nNow we can do, we've talked about,\nfrom user and password, we've talked about\n\n455\n00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,865\nbirth certificates, and loading them\nup on smart cards and logging in.\n\n456\n00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:56,015\nWe talked a little bit about\nusing online accounts.\n\n457\n00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:58,695\nActually, I don't know if\nwe've got online accounts yet,\n\n458\n00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:00,335\nwhich is another option we can use.\n\n459\n00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:02,765\nJust another type of\naccount where it's stored.\n\n460\n00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:06,275\nWe've got bio metrics and\nnow something completely new.\n\n461\n00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,190\nMm-hm.\n\n462\n00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,470\nWith Windows 8, I guess,\nis when that came out.\n\n463\n00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,045\nIt wasn't even available in Windows 7.\n\n464\n00:21:11,045 --> 00:21:11,550\nMm-mm.\n\n465\n00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,380\nIs this whole picture password concept.\n\n466\n00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,105\nKinda cool, right?\n\n467\n00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,020\nMm-hm.\n\n468\n00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,359\nYeah, what, let's see, what,\nwhich one did you sign in as?\n\n469\n00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,810\nI did not I didn't want to kick you off,\nactually I am\n\n470\n00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,840\nI think director you got me over there\non tricaster two if I'm not mistaken?\n\n471\n00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,560\nAll right then I'll Or else did I\njust drop by clicking that again?\n\n472\n00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,840\nNope here I go.\nAll right I'll I'll sign in on number one.\n\n473\n00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,880\nActually I was already signed in.\n\n474\n00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,130\nNope, I'm on one.\n\n475\n00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,250\nAll right.\n\n476\n00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,355\nThat's the way it should be, right?\n\n477\n00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:41,770\n[LAUGH] So yeah.\n\n478\n00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,770\nDo you want to set one up?\n\n479\n00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,996\nDo you want me to set one up?\n\n480\n00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:45,670\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n481\n00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,890\nGo ahead, you go ahead and pull that up.\n\n482\n00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,880\nSo, Jason, why don't you go ahead and\nfire up, his.\n\n483\n00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520\nI'll tell you guys about\nit while he's doing it.\n\n484\n00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,130\nPicture password is where I'm going\nto use a picture as my password.\n\n485\n00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,800\nNow I don't mean that I'm going to use\nthis particular picture as my password.\n\n486\n00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,290\nWe take a picture, then we do what we\ncall gestures on top of that picture.\n\n487\n00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,760\nAnd by doing the proper\ngestures on that picture,\n\n488\n00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,880\nit's gonna know that it's me, and\nit's gonna allow me to authenticate.\n\n489\n00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,930\nAnd really, I think that,\none of the reasons we're seeing this more,\n\n490\n00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,470\nmore now than, than before or\nwas this is becoming more popular,\n\n491\n00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,850\nis a lot of the touch screen devices,\nmakes it really easy.\n\n492\n00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,280\nYou know,\nI don't know how many of you guys have a,\n\n493\n00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,180\nsome type of tablet or, pad of some kind.\n\n494\n00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,455\nAnd, and you go,\nyou've got a complex password, right?\n\n495\n00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,390\nMm-hm.\nAnd trying to log on with that complex\n\n496\n00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,800\npassword on those, those screen-based\nkeyboards and switch them back and\n\n497\n00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,775\nforth between the special\ncharacters Characters and\n\n498\n00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:44,685\nthe regular characters and it just, to me,\nI don't know it seems like a challenge.\n\n499\n00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:48,085\nBecause it's not like I can sit,\nI don't lay it down and\n\n500\n00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:51,525\nput my keys on my hands on the home row.\n\n501\n00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:53,950\nWhere as a picture password is easy.\n\n502\n00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,560\nYeah.\n\n503\n00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,200\nYeah, I would just do your gestures.\n\n504\n00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,960\nAlright so let's go in and set that up.\n\n505\n00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,540\nTo get to it, the, the windows 8,\nthe setting up your password,\n\n506\n00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,235\nthat's your policy.\n\n507\n00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:05,326\nMm-hm.\nPassword policy, or your password sign on.\n\n508\n00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:10,034\nIn settings, pc settings,\nand, in the users, [COUGH],\n\n509\n00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:13,970\nWe have, create a picture password link.\n\n510\n00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,640\nWe'll click on that and\nyou have to enter in your password so\n\n511\n00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,570\nit make, Yeah cause right now you're\nlogging in with a password so\n\n512\n00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,340\nthat's the only way it has\nto verify that it's you.\n\n513\n00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,450\nAnd if you're gonna change\nthe log in options for\n\n514\n00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,265\nthis particular account,\nthen it wants to make sure it's you.\n\n515\n00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:30,480\nMm-hm.\n\n516\n00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,600\nThen you get to pick your picture.\n\n517\n00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,040\nThat's a nice picture.\n\n518\n00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,615\nAll right so we'll we'll choose a picture\nand the only picture I, I have.\n\n519\n00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,800\n[LAUGH] In here right now is the pony\ngrabs picture which we will use this one.\n\n520\n00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,970\nAnd.\nI think we've seen that in\n\n521\n00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,710\na couple other episodes.\n\n522\n00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,920\nSo, that thing has made its way around.\n\n523\n00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,360\nAnd, and once we're in here,\nwe can kinda drag it around.\n\n524\n00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,430\nIt, you know, if we had a very large\npicture or a, a special point,\n\n525\n00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,650\nwe can drag it around a little bit.\n\n526\n00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,490\nSo we'll just kinda leave\nthis guy right there is fine.\n\n527\n00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,119\nAll right.\n\n528\n00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,998\nWe'll select to use\nthis pass this picture.\n\n529\n00:23:58,998 --> 00:24:02,087\nMm-hm.\nAnd then there are three gestures.\n\n530\n00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:05,256\nTo use, and there are circles, Mm-hm.\n\n531\n00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:08,180\nLines and I guess just dots.\n\n532\n00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,463\nDots, yeah.\nJust little touch points.\n\n533\n00:24:09,463 --> 00:24:10,837\nYeah, pretty catchy.\n\n534\n00:24:10,837 --> 00:24:15,690\nAnd with circles they can be little\ncircles, big circles, clockwise and\n\n535\n00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,320\ncounterclockwise.\n\n536\n00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,130\nIt would make a difference, right,\nif you just circle clockwise versus\n\n537\n00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,750\na circle counterclockwise,\nthat's the same thing.\n\n538\n00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,740\nLines would be directional, right,\n\n539\n00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,458\nwhere you start versus where\nyou end when you draw the line.\n\n540\n00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,670\nYep.\nAnd then you gotta,\n\n541\n00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,660\nyou gotta come up with three gestures,\nright?\n\n542\n00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,730\nYep, three gestures.\n\n543\n00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,804\nSo let's see.\n\n544\n00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:35,267\nLet see what he's gonna do.\n\n545\n00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,230\nFor this guy, we'll draw a line.\n\n546\n00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,550\nI'm gonna use the touch\nscreen to draw this on here.\n\n547\n00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,070\nSo, let's see.\n\n548\n00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,872\nWe'll just draw a, a line down his leg.\n\n549\n00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:51,680\nWe'll circle his head and\nthen dot, dot the eye.\n\n550\n00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,560\nI don't know if you guys are seeing,\nit's really faint up there on the screen.\n\n551\n00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,140\nBut what it was, as he was drawing those\nAnd so now he's gonna try to repeat it.\n\n552\n00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,060\nSo there you saw one line,\nnow watch up around the head.\n\n553\n00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,220\nHe's drawing a circle around that,\ncounter clockwise and\n\n554\n00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,180\nthen he's gonna touch the eyeball.\n\n555\n00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,460\nAnd so you have to repeat it.\n\n556\n00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,200\nJust like you were typing your password\ntwice to make sure you entered\n\n557\n00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,200\nthe same password,\nhe had to repeat those gestures.\n\n558\n00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,880\nThree separate gestures\nhe had repeat it twice.\n\n559\n00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,450\nNow it knows what his gestures are so\n\n560\n00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,755\nif he logs off, he should be able\nto use those to log back in.\n\n561\n00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:26,870\nMm-hm.\n\n562\n00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,560\nWe'll find out here.\n\n563\n00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,070\nYep.\n\n564\n00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,770\nAnd I am going to disconnect\nfrom that right quick and\n\n565\n00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,320\nI wonder if it still,\npicked it picked it up.\n\n566\n00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,268\nHey, Jason is this still\ncoming over on EBGA?\n\n567\n00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:45,440\nWhy did you disconnect from?\n\n568\n00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,360\nWhat?\nYou're gonna put that up here?\n\n569\n00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,860\nYep.\n\n570\n00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,210\nGive you guys an overhead shot, so\n\n571\n00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,992\nyou can actually see what he's\ndoing here on, on the screen.\n\n572\n00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,670\nAll right, so.\n\n573\n00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,730\nYou got it?\n\n574\n00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,210\nI think so, maybe?\n\n575\n00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,290\nThere we go.\nAll right, good enough.\n\n576\n00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:04,950\nAll right.\n\n577\n00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,290\nSo, I will go ahead and Lock the computer.\n\n578\n00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,730\nAnd we'll slide that up.\n\n579\n00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,070\nAnd so now, this is where we'll\nsign on with our little password.\n\n580\n00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:22,450\nSo we'll do the same thing of, trace his\nleg, circle his head and dot his eye.\n\n581\n00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,460\nAnd there we go.\n\n582\n00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,220\nIsn't that amazing.\n\n583\n00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,820\nAnd then we signed in.\n\n584\n00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,460\nRight.\n\n585\n00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,740\nSo not you know, not lot of crazy,\n\n586\n00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,050\nfun stuff with well, all right,\ncrazy stuff with picture passwords.\n\n587\n00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,800\nYeah.\nPretty.\n\n588\n00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,250\nYeah it, it, it's a new concept.\n\n589\n00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,850\nI mean there's a couple of things you\ngotta worry about with these guys.\n\n590\n00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,710\nFirst of all the, you know, it can almost,\n\n591\n00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,100\nit can be more secure than a password,\nreally.\n\n592\n00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,210\nBecause there's many more options, right?\n\n593\n00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,890\nWhereas with passwords we're limited\nby the number of characters in\n\n594\n00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,628\na character set.\n\n595\n00:26:45,628 --> 00:26:50,022\nWith touching on the screen like that,\nI mean there's a none,\n\n596\n00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:53,090\nnot an unlimited I suppose, but\nthere's probably a much larger\n\n597\n00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,330\nbase of possibilities that you could\nuse for that which is kind of cool.\n\n598\n00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,125\nBut there is some down side to that too,\nall right?\n\n599\n00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:01,750\nHm-hm.\nThere are,\n\n600\n00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,050\nthere are some issues with\nthe whole picture password.\n\n601\n00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:10,450\nFirst and foremost is, the,\nthe what's a good way to say it?\n\n602\n00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,020\nThe, the oils from your hands.\n\n603\n00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,555\nSmears.\n\n604\n00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:15,410\nYeah, you know?\n\n605\n00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,630\nBecause if you look at\none of these screens.\n\n606\n00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,220\nI don't know if you can turn\nyour screen off for a second or,\n\n607\n00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,290\nor, well you guys know.\n\n608\n00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,090\nYou've got your devices,\nyour smart phones, and things like that.\n\n609\n00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,250\nYou turn that thing off, and\nwhen you've got that black screen,\n\n610\n00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,220\nwhen there's no light from behind it and\nyou look at it, just, it's all smeary,\n\n611\n00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,790\nyou know, from all your fingerprints.\n\n612\n00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,975\nI can usually tell what game I've\nbeen playing the most on my iPad.\n\n613\n00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:39,370\n[LAUGH] By where the,\nthe smears are on the screen there, right?\n\n614\n00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,810\nRight.\nSo if you use that same picture\n\n615\n00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,060\npassword over and over and\nover and I go pick up your device,\n\n616\n00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,710\nI might be able to look at it And\nsee your gestures.\n\n617\n00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,545\nI don't know which one you did first,\nbut there's only three.\n\n618\n00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,560\nMm-hm.\nSo it's not gonna take me long to try this\n\n619\n00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,015\none first, then that one first,\nthen the other one first.\n\n620\n00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:55,990\nMm-hm.\nSo that, that's a little bit of a concern.\n\n621\n00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,890\nYep.\nJust means you gotta keep your screen\n\n622\n00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,642\nclean, right.\n\n623\n00:27:58,642 --> 00:27:59,565\nMm-hm.\n[CROSSTALK] Keep around,\n\n624\n00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:01,015\nwe got our little terry cloths.\n\n625\n00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,180\nMm-hm.\nThat we keep pretty handy and, and\n\n626\n00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,720\nwipe that screen down all the time.\n\n627\n00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,170\nOr maybe we, maybe it was extremely\ndirty and there be smears and\n\n628\n00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,320\ntouches all over it and\nit's be hard to even There you go,\n\n629\n00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,120\nthat's another way to look at it right, if\nyou just never clean it you just couldn't\n\n630\n00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,902\nsee the actual password swipes from\nthe game swipes and, and things like that.\n\n631\n00:28:18,902 --> 00:28:21,550\nSo yeah, that's a good point we\ncould just never clean the screen.\n\n632\n00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,830\nThe other thing I will warn you\nguys about picture passwords is\n\n633\n00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,380\ndon't be obvious, right?.\n\n634\n00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,120\nIf you put a picture of your three kids\nup there as your picture password and\n\n635\n00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,940\nyou circle the three kids faces,\n\n636\n00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,390\nI mean that's what the bad guy\nis gonna try first, right?\n\n637\n00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,110\nMm.\nSo I will take a picture that's a little\n\n638\n00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,590\nbit busy.\n\n639\n00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,120\nAnd, and\nthen I will do something unexpected.\n\n640\n00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,900\nRight.\nI'll put a circle\n\n641\n00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,640\nwhere there's nothing really to circle.\n\n642\n00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,480\nAnd draw a line where it doesn't\nmake sense to draw a line.\n\n643\n00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,420\nNow the downside of that\nis it becomes difficult,\n\n644\n00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,015\nmore difficult to remember\nwhat the heck you used.\n\n645\n00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,220\nMm-hm. Yeah. Other than that.\n\n646\n00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,120\nYeah, you know picture passwords,\nI I use them.\n\n647\n00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,960\nI use them on this computer,\nI use them at the house.\n\n648\n00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,580\nYeah.\n\n649\n00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,080\nI have a six year old and\nyou know on the computers at the house,\n\n650\n00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,220\nthey have good strong passwords on.\n\n651\n00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,230\nAnd I don't expect the kid to remember it.\n\n652\n00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,643\nAnd I could just write\nit down let say I have.\n\n653\n00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:16,990\nRight.\nWhen it's at the house.\n\n654\n00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,630\nBut with a picture password, you know,\nit could be a picture of his choice for\n\n655\n00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,770\nhis account.\n\n656\n00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,580\nRight.\nAnd you know, it can be the, you know,\n\n657\n00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,770\nyou can use a touchscreen or\na mouse Is it transformers?\n\n658\n00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,680\nNo, it's PowerRangers.\n\n659\n00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,980\nOh, Power Rangers.\n\n660\n00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,800\nGood.\nAnd you know, and you can just click, so\n\n661\n00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,920\nhe clicks it and, you know, it unlocks.\n\n662\n00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,410\nReal nice, Now if though.\n\n663\n00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,585\nAnd that's a good point, you know.\n\n664\n00:29:36,585 --> 00:29:38,290\nMm-hm.\nWith the fact that you don't have to use\n\n665\n00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,290\nyour finger, right?\n\n666\n00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,800\nMm-hm.\nIf, if you you can gesture with the mouse\n\n667\n00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,505\nas well by clicking and holding or\nclicking and dragging that mouse.\n\n668\n00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:45,280\nMm-hm.\n\n669\n00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,765\nAnd I believe you get you get five tries.\n\n670\n00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:50,060\nMm-hm.\nYou get five tries to get it right and\n\n671\n00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,575\nthen Windows will lock out\nthe picture password option.\n\n672\n00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:55,140\nMm-hm.\nAnd force you to use your.\n\n673\n00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,510\nYou know, your real password and\ntyping it in.\n\n674\n00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,640\nI think I'll go that route.\n\n675\n00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,550\nSo yeah so you get five tries.\n\n676\n00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,640\nFive tries to get it right.\n\n677\n00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,620\nAnd that's another good point to it.\n\n678\n00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,310\nIt does not replace your password.\n\n679\n00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,205\nIt's just an alternate method to login.\n\n680\n00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,330\nMm-hm.\nSo you can,\n\n681\n00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,310\nif you're on a device that\ndoesn't have a touchscreen and\n\n682\n00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,100\nyou'd rather just type in your password,\nthere was that button over there just\n\n683\n00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,820\nClick that said I just want\nto type in my password.\n\n684\n00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,240\nOr if you can't remember what your,\n\n685\n00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,730\nwhat gestures you used you can\njust type in your password.\n\n686\n00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,820\nYeah, we're actually getting that once,\nonce we set up the pin.\n\n687\n00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,390\nThen we can choose which,\nwhich of the three.\n\n688\n00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,110\nAwesome.\nMm-hm.\n\n689\n00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,260\nSounds like a plan, sweet.\n\n690\n00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,200\nBut.\nYeah, right up on, on break.\n\n691\n00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,120\nMm-hm Yeah, we'll take a break.\n\n692\n00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,790\nWe'll come back.\n\n693\n00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,050\nWe've got two more,\nsubtopics to hit up on.\n\n694\n00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:37,810\nSounds good.\n\n695\n00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,500\nAnd, all right.\n\n696\n00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,729\nWe'll see you back after the break.\n\n697\n00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:47,647\n[MUSIC]\n\n698\n00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:49,180\nIt's finished.\n\n699\n00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:56,730\nWelcome back to a, the exciting conclusion\nof our two part show on off and off.\n\n700\n00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,365\nOff and off.\n\n701\n00:30:57,365 --> 00:30:58,050\nUh-huh.\n\n702\n00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,820\nAuthentication and authorization,\nwhich are not the same.\n\n703\n00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,145\nRight, because I know you guys all watch\nthe last episode we did, part one.\n\n704\n00:31:05,145 --> 00:31:05,820\nMm-hm.\n\n705\n00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,320\nGood deal, sweet.\n\n706\n00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,230\nAll right so what we have up\nnext is to create a, a pen.\n\n707\n00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,640\nA pen, typically you know, when I think\nof a pen I think of like a Sharpy.\n\n708\n00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,720\nATM, pin.\n\n709\n00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,540\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n710\n00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,390\nATM machine.\n\n711\n00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,630\nYes, an ATM machine or a pin number.\n\n712\n00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,880\nIt's right because number is in the end.\n\n713\n00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,730\nYeah.\n\n714\n00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:32,980\nAnd yeah, typically, you know, to me I\nthink of the four-digit numerical number.\n\n715\n00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,350\nAnd Windows 8 accepts the use of pins.\n\n716\n00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,770\nSo yeah, let's show how [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nexactly.\n\n717\n00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,470\nI think, pretty straightforward concept.\n\n718\n00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:46,784\nEverybody out there has a, an ATM card\nthat they've got a pin that's associated\n\n719\n00:31:46,784 --> 00:31:51,784\nwith it or a, I don't know an iPad or\nan Android device where you got to type in\n\n720\n00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:56,730\na pin to get onto your lock screen or\nyour iPhones and things like that, so.\n\n721\n00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,520\nYou know, its, its a common method of,\nof accessing a device.\n\n722\n00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,946\nAnd especially when you, go ahead and you\ncan pull it up while I am talking here.\n\n723\n00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:09,348\nYou know it's, it's, it's, when you're\ndoing the picture password, again,\n\n724\n00:32:09,348 --> 00:32:12,480\nif you're not on a touch screen,\nyou can't do the picture password or\n\n725\n00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,610\nyou don't have a mouse, some type\nof device for something like that,\n\n726\n00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:19,680\nmaybe the pin's easier, or you forgot\nyour gesture, you can type in the pin so.\n\n727\n00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,180\nYep.\n\n728\n00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,910\nAll right then our PC settings where we\nwent to do our, picture password, Um-hm.\n\n729\n00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,295\ngo in there and create a pin.\n\n730\n00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:29,680\nUm-hm.\n\n731\n00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,130\nQuick little click, and\nof course we have to verify ourselves.\n\n732\n00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,070\nHm, that just made me think of my\nfather you know, like, on your,\n\n733\n00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,450\non your cable boxes and stuff, where, when\nyou do pay per view, you have to have a,\n\n734\n00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,760\na pin typically to, to accept the charge\nfor the pay-per-view and, and Dad,\n\n735\n00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,589\nwhat's your, what's your PIN for\nthis pay-per-view?\n\n736\n00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:49,279\nOh, 0000.\n\n737\n00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,798\n[LAUGH] Like, oh, okay.\n\n738\n00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,775\n[LAUGH] Like, why even have one, right?\n\n739\n00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:54,940\n[LAUGH] Nice.\n\n740\n00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,340\nSorry to- [LAUGH] No, that's, that's cool.\n\n741\n00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,994\nAll right, and for this- Just gave away\nmy father's PIN for his, [LAUGH] For\n\n742\n00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:02,985\nhis pay per- Yeah, his pay-per-view, yeah.\n\n743\n00:33:02,985 --> 00:33:05,840\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I guess that's right, huh?\n\n744\n00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,984\nSo, Dad, if you're out there listening,\nyou better change that.\n\n745\n00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:13,300\n[LAUGH] Alright, so this one, okay,\nit does call out a pin is a quick,\n\n746\n00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,210\nconvenient way to sign into this\nPC using a four-digit code.\n\n747\n00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,720\nFour digits.\nSo they do call out four digits.\n\n748\n00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,780\nThat's all you get to use.\n\n749\n00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,180\nYep.\nFour digits which,\n\n750\n00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,700\nas we've talked about in our Security Plus\nepisodes, if you guys have got those,\n\n751\n00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,590\nI mean, think about how strong that is.\n\n752\n00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,800\nRight?\nYou've got four digits,\n\n753\n00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,400\nYou've got ten possibilities per digit.\n\n754\n00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,360\nSo that's gonna be four\nto the tenth power yeah.\n\n755\n00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,390\n100, 1000, 10,000 possibilities for that?\n\n756\n00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,428\nIf my math is correct.\n\n757\n00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:45,030\n[LAUGH] So yeah.\n\n758\n00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,709\nYou know, not all that many possibilities.\n\n759\n00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,630\nBut it's not means to be\na super secure type passwords.\n\n760\n00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:00,980\nAll right so we, so now that we have our,\nour pin set-up so let's sign out.\n\n761\n00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,620\nAll right.\nAnd sign back in with it.\n\n762\n00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,360\nAll right.\n\n763\n00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,110\nOkay.\nSounds like a plan.\n\n764\n00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,208\nSo I think we will need to\nswitch over to this other one.\n\n765\n00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,978\n[SOUND] Yep.\n\n766\n00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:13,250\nSo what he's going to do now, he's, we're\ngonna have to put this on the the overhead\n\n767\n00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,605\ncam, because when we sign out,\nwe lose the connectivity just momentarily.\n\n768\n00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:17,280\nMm-hm.\n\n769\n00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,350\nSo now you can see him.\n\n770\n00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,770\nHe's gonna pull that up on the sky cam.\n\n771\n00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:26,020\nI'll try to get my shoulder out\nof the shot there, and yeah.\n\n772\n00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,550\nAll right so here we go.\n\n773\n00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,995\nAnd we'll swipe up on this guy.\n\n774\n00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:29,670\nMm-hm.\n\n775\n00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,380\nAnd there we go.\n\n776\n00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:36,170\nSo we got a little, pop up here,\nwe'll do our, our PIN.\n\n777\n00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,482\nHey, now we know your ATM.\n\n778\n00:34:37,482 --> 00:34:41,040\nMm-hm.\n[LAUGH] Yeah, it was the same one he uses.\n\n779\n00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,385\nOne two three four, easy to remember.\n\n780\n00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:43,650\n[LAUGH] So here we go.\n\n781\n00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:48,190\nWe entered in you don't have to press\nenter or nothing, it goes right in.\n\n782\n00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,258\nYup.\nSo now that we have.\n\n783\n00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:52,778\nLet's see I'm going to\nlock this guy again.\n\n784\n00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:55,011\nMm-hm.\nSo now we have we have our,\n\n785\n00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,390\nour Windows account password to sign in.\n\n786\n00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,480\nWe have our picture password\nwith the PointGrabs.\n\n787\n00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,140\nAnd a four-digit numerical PIN.\n\n788\n00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,415\nNice.\nNow under, let's see, it is, yep,\n\n789\n00:35:06,415 --> 00:35:11,324\npretty small under there, but\njust underneath where I ended the password\n\n790\n00:35:11,324 --> 00:35:15,774\nnext to my picture there,\na blue link it says sign in options.\n\n791\n00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:18,695\nClicking that now we have three icons.\n\n792\n00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:19,460\nMm-hm.\n\n793\n00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,270\nOne is our our regular password that,\nthat we type in.\n\n794\n00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,520\nRight.\nOne icon is for the picture password and\n\n795\n00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,135\nthe other icon is for the pin.\n\n796\n00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:28,670\nNice.\n\n797\n00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,400\nSo once we have them all set up or\neven just two.\n\n798\n00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,370\nYou can pick and\nchoose which one that you wanna do.\n\n799\n00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,690\nLet, let's say if I'm- Whichever\none is more convenient for\n\n800\n00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,695\nwhatever device you're on.\n\n801\n00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:38,340\nMm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n802\n00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,690\nOr something like that.\n\n803\n00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,295\nI, so yeah- Or, like, in this case,\nwith your XPS, sorry.\n\n804\n00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:46,300\n[LAUGH] You know,\nmaybe I've got it in, in tablet mode.\n\n805\n00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,540\nAnd it might be easier to log in with that\npicture password, like he's doing now.\n\n806\n00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,400\nOr you know, or if I'm in laptop mode,\nif I've got the screen flipped around and\n\n807\n00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,920\nI've got the keyboard right in front of\nme, it might be more convenient just to,\n\n808\n00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,185\nto type in the password that way.\n\n809\n00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:02,430\nMm-hm.\nSo it's nice that you can,\n\n810\n00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,400\nthat your flexible, right?\n\n811\n00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,730\nYou're not tied to one particular method.\n\n812\n00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,570\nYou set up one, two ,or all three of them\nand then you can use any one of those to,\n\n813\n00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,520\nto authenticate to that laptop or\nto that device.\n\n814\n00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,130\nMm-hm.\n\n815\n00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,144\nYeah you know I did some\nsome traveling this summer.\n\n816\n00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:17,294\nMm-hm.\nAnd sitting on the,\n\n817\n00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:20,966\non the airplane right I mean there's some\nguy sitting right next to me and he's,\n\n818\n00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:23,021\nI mean he's staring right at,\nat my computer.\n\n819\n00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:25,749\n[LAUGH] Of course I think flipping\nit around he's probably going,\n\n820\n00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:26,752\noh my gosh what is that?\n\n821\n00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,623\nRight.\nSweet, awesome.\n\n822\n00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:28,411\nThat's pretty cool. Exactly. Awesome!\n\n823\n00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,066\nIt's just my Dell.\n\n824\n00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:33,501\nBut yeah and I, I didn't really want\nto circle on, on my screen and,\n\n825\n00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:37,014\nyou know, show everybody the picture\npasswords that I normally use.\n\n826\n00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:38,461\nMm-hm.\nAnd it was convenient\n\n827\n00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:42,570\nthat I could choose then for my typed\nin password, you know it was nice and\n\n828\n00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,490\nlong and I'm used to it so\nI can type it in really fast.\n\n829\n00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,871\nLess chance of him doing any\nshoulder surfing on you and\n\n830\n00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:49,355\ncatching that password, yeah.\n\n831\n00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:50,340\nMm-hm.\n\n832\n00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,140\nSo it, there you go,\nwhen you enter it in wrong, five times,\n\n833\n00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,375\nit locks out that option.\n\n834\n00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,450\nMm-hm.\nAnd you have to use your, your,\n\n835\n00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,990\nyour full typed in password.\n\n836\n00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,800\nYep.\nPretty cool.\n\n837\n00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,235\nIt, pretty easy to implement,\neasy to turn on.\n\n838\n00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:03,880\nMm-hm.\n\n839\n00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,680\nYou know, and it doesn't have to be on a,\na touch screen.\n\n840\n00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,740\nIt, It's convenient with a touch screen.\n\n841\n00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,725\nBut yeah, so we can go that route.\n\n842\n00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:13,870\nPretty cool.\nYep the last,\n\n843\n00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,815\nlast sub-objective that we have\nis creating a Microsoft account.\n\n844\n00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,590\nMm-hm.\n\n845\n00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,560\nIt'd be good of Microsoft to use Sign Up.\n\n846\n00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,782\nBut we're, we,\nit can be done through Windows 8.\n\n847\n00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:27,925\nYeah we'll take a look at that, you know.\n\n848\n00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:30,525\nMost of you probably have\na Microsoft account at this point,\n\n849\n00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:35,125\neither an older Hotmail account or\na .outlook type account or\n\n850\n00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:38,715\npossibly a .live account or\nsomething like that.\n\n851\n00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:43,170\nYou know, Windows now with Windows\n8 a lot of stuff is cloud driven.\n\n852\n00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,700\nOne of the really cool things about\nWindows 8 is the ability to synchronise\n\n853\n00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,170\nyour settings between\nyour different devices.\n\n854\n00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,860\nYou know, for an example, on my laptop,\n\n855\n00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:57,850\nbecause I sign on with a Microsoft\naccount, I can change my background here,\n\n856\n00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,380\nand then when I go back to my house, and\nthen I log on to my laptop there, or\n\n857\n00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,490\nmy desktop that's in my office,\nthat background's there, right?\n\n858\n00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,820\nFavorites are a huge one, right?\n\n859\n00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,790\nI mean, how many times, you're on one\ndevice, and you add a favorite for\n\n860\n00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,760\nsome site, and then you go do,\nyou're sitting at another device, and\n\n861\n00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,890\nwishing you had that link?\n\n862\n00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,870\nLike, what was that site?\n\n863\n00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,885\nI wanna go check that out again.\n\n864\n00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:16,400\nMm-hm.\n\n865\n00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,630\nSo your favorites will synchronize\nbetween your different devices.\n\n866\n00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,080\nAnd that's all because you're logging\nin with that Microsoft account.\n\n867\n00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,200\nIf you were using a local account,\nthere's no way to synchronize that.\n\n868\n00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,560\nYour Microsoft account has cloud\nspace given to it with a SkyDrive and\n\n869\n00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,480\nit can use that to,\nto,store your settings and\n\n870\n00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,400\nsynchronize those between\nyour different devices.\n\n871\n00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,630\nSo, really cool.\n\n872\n00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,790\nAnd, and you can set it up through\nWindows as I think Nate is getting ready\n\n873\n00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,570\nto show us right now,\n\n874\n00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,580\nhow we can we can go into a Windows\ninterface, when you install Windows.\n\n875\n00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,520\nWhen you install Windows,\nit wants you to use a Microsoft account.\n\n876\n00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,670\nRight?\nMm-hm You actually have to click a link\n\n877\n00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,570\nthat's small and tiny down there to say no\nI don't wanna set up a Microsoft account.\n\n878\n00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,780\nI wanna use a local account.\n\n879\n00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,480\nSo, they've,\nthey really want you to use that.\n\n880\n00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,820\nThey want you to use their cloud\nservices and things like that.\n\n881\n00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,460\nBut if you already had a Microsoft\naccount you could use that as well.\n\n882\n00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,360\nI mean,\nyou don't have to set up a new one,\n\n883\n00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,540\njust to get onto your Windows 8 machine.\n\n884\n00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,430\nYup.\n\n885\n00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,430\nAll right, yeah.\n\n886\n00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,380\nLet's, let's go to, let's do\nthe process of setting this guy up.\n\n887\n00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,960\nOn, so on, on here, all right, it's\na little, a little difficult to see but\n\n888\n00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,350\nI'm, I'm clicking on the, almost\nlifted my computer up to go above the,\n\n889\n00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,490\nthe box there.\n\n890\n00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,440\nWe'll click on Settings,\nit's just right there under Devices.\n\n891\n00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,800\nThe camera's,\nkinda hidden down there at the bottom.\n\n892\n00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,270\nAnd this little guy pops up here.\n\n893\n00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,836\nWe're, back here into, into Users.\n\n894\n00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:37,345\nMm-hm.\n\n895\n00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:38,195\nAnd we're there.\n\n896\n00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:40,375\nSo we can add a user.\n\n897\n00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:42,445\nAlright, here we go.\n\n898\n00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:47,225\nSo if, if the person already had a,\nMicrosoft account, Mm-hm.\n\n899\n00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:52,140\nOf, whoever we're signing in here,\ncreating, you enter in the account and\n\n900\n00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,980\nthen it's, it's there.\n\n901\n00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,140\nYeah.\nAnd you sign in or log out, sign in\n\n902\n00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,875\nwith that kind of information and it'll\nstart to build and set up everything.\n\n903\n00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:00,948\nMm-hm.\n\n904\n00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:05,695\nWe do have a a link down here,\nthe second one, and it says sign up for\n\n905\n00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,736\na new

question.\n\n958\n00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,700\nSpeaking of which, you know I,\nit you know I was talking to you once\n\n959\n00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,420\nabout these questions and you know\nit's like, your mother's maiden name.\n\n960\n00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,540\nWell, potentially you could find out\nwhat my mother's maiden name is, or\n\n961\n00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,170\nthrough the internet.\n\n962\n00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,150\nAbsolutely.\n\n963\n00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,170\nOr, you know, a little bit of social\nengineering we're getting on, you know,\n\n964\n00:42:41,170

in...\n\n969\n00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,290\nSpokane, Washington and my,\nmy school mascot was a dragon.\n\n970\n00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:02,940\nMy first pet was Sonic and my mother's\nmaiden name was Chickabow, right?\n\n971\n00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,240\nAnd, you know, and that's com, all\ncompletely fictitious, but I use that for\n\n972\n00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,420\nevery one of my different websites or\nmy secret questions because that way,\n\n973\n00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,615\nas you said, it's easy to find\ninformation about people.\n\n974\n00:43:12,615 --> 00:43:13,800\nMm-hm.\nI mean, look at their Facebook page\n\n975\n00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,420\nand they probably.\n\n976\n00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,740\nTell you all that information themselves.\n\n977\n00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,880\nA little research, and\nyou're gonna be able to find it,\n\n978\n00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,420\nso don't use your real\nmother's maiden name.\n\n979\n00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:27,620\nDon't use your real, high school, cuz we\ncan find that stuff out very, very easily.\n\n980\n00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,859\nSo not very secure if you\nuse your actual information.\n\n981\n00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,060\nAll right, here we go.\n\n982\n00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,580\nEnhance my online experience\nwhile we're waiting,\n\n983\n00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,260\nMicrosoft advertising use\nmy account information.\n\n984\n00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:39,900\nNo.\nOkay.\n\n985\n00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,410\nAll right, okay.\n\n986\n00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,370\nAnd send me promotional\noffers from Microsoft?\n\n987\n00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,340\nNo thanks.\n\n988\n00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,960\nMaybe if they have the, Yeah, no.\n\n989\n00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,000\nOkay, uncheck.\n\n990\n00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,360\nNow, speaking of which, do you submit\nyour error report Reports, like it says,\n\n991\n00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,670\nsubmit this to Microsoft.\n\n992\n00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,630\nIt, it depends.\n\n993\n00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,220\nYou do those?\n\n994\n00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,240\nSometimes I do, sometimes I do.\n\n995\n00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,020\nYou know, the thing is, we, we make,\nwe complain about things when they\n\n996\n00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,160\ndon't work, and when things have\nbugs in them and things like that,\n\n997\n00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,420\nand if we don't submit\nThen our information.\n\n998\n00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,970\nYou know, if we submit our information it\nmakes it a lot easier for them to try and\n\n999\n00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:11,730\nfix that kind of stuff.\n\n1000\n00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,560\nSo sometimes I feel a little guilty\nabout not checking those

able to sync their settings when\n\n1133\n00:49:50,624 --> 00:49:54,005\nthey go out to the branch office, and they\nlog into one of those computers out there.\n\n1134\n00:49:54,005 --> 00:49:55,905\nSynchronize their settings and\nthings like that,\n\n1135\n00:49:55,905 --> 00:49:59,130\nwhen they go to their laptop at home,\nthey get to synchronize their settings.\n\n1136\n00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,680\nBut you don't want them creating new\naccounts that are unmonitored or\n\n1137\n00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,470\nunknown by your organization and\nthings like that.\n\n1138\n00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,730\nSo we can choose\nthe different options there.\n\n1139\n00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:11,099\nWe wanna let them use one,\nbut not create

out.\n\n1145\n00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,872\nOh.\nIn Administrative Templates\n\n1146\n00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:25,490\n> Windows Components and Biometrics.\n\n1147\n00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,560\nMm.\n\n1148\n00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,719\nSo, you going in here, so\nAllow the use of biometrics.\n\n1149\n00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:32,435\nMm-hm.\nAllow users to log on using

again,\n\n1157\n00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,750\njust going back to the whole point that\nWindows 8 now fully supports biometrics.\n\n1158\n00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,915\nI mean, it's all built right\ninto that operating system to,\n\n1159\n00:50:58,915 --> 00:51:00,679\nbecause it is becoming more common.\n\n1160\n00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:02,107\nMm-hm.\nJust to see the different\n\n1161\n00:51:02,107 --> 00:51:05,470\nbiometric devices out there, and\nuse those as authentication methods.\n\n1162\n00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,647\nAnd as we said earlier,\nI mean as that technology improves and\n\n1163\n00:51:08,647 --> 00:51:11,937\ngets even more secure I think\nit's a very convenient, and, and\n\n1164\n00:51:11,937 --> 00:51:15,842\nI do see it being as one of the primary\nauthentication methods in the future.\n\n1165\n00:51:15,842 --> 00:51:17,724\nMm-hm.\nBut you know, who knows, right?\n\n1166\n00:51:17,724 --> 00:51:22,600\nWe'll never need more than 640K of memory,\nso you, you just never know.\n\n1167\n00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,424\n[LAUGH] Mm-hm.\n\n1168\n00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:24,806\nWhich, I mean,\nthat's what your computer has, right?\n\n1169\n00:51:24,806 --> 00:51:27,999\nAnd didn't you say it is like,\nit is an old, ancient machine?\n\n1170\n00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:29,066\nI did.\nI just, I, I, I did.\n\n1171\n00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:30,204\nI just upgraded- Mm-hm.\n\n1172\n00:51:30,204 --> 00:51:30,806\nAnd I, I am up to 640.\n\n1173\n00:51:30,806 --> 00:51:31,364\nWow.\n\n1174\n00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:32,178\nSo, yeah, yeah.\n\n1175\n00:51:32,178 --> 00:51:32,758\nThat's crazy.\n\n1176\n00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:35,485\n[LAUGH] I also got my\nmodem jacked up to 566.\n\n1177\n00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:37,630\nIt was at 33, yeah, before.\n\n1178\n00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,040\nSo, I'm, I'm catching up with you guys.\n\n1179\n00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,630\nDo you use the, the Hayes or\nthe, USRobotics?\n\n1180\n00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:43,226\nUSRobotics.\n\n1181\n00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:43,905\n[LAUGH] Oh nice, yes.\n\n1182\n00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:45,507\nYes, see, and that's the one to get.\n\n1183\n00:51:45,507 --> 00:51:46,228\nYes, yes.\n\n1184\n00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,167\nInternal, external?\n\n1185\n00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,085\nYeah, external.\n\n1186\n00:51:48,085 --> 00:51:48,805\nNice, yes.\n\n1187\n00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,349\nI love to see the lights going- Mm-hm.\n\n1188\n00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:51,592\nAnd, and I love that noise.\n\n1189\n00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:53,413\nMm, yeah, the little rocker\nswitch to turn it on and off?\n\n1190\n00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:54,714\n[LAUGH] Yeah- Yeah.\n\n1191\n00:51:54,714 --> 00:51:55,491\nYou know it, you know it.\n\n1192\n00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:56,166\nSweet.\n\n1193\n00:51:56,166 --> 00:52:01,667\n[LAUGH] Okay, that wraps up\nthe subjectives that we have for Mm-hm.\n\n1194\n00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:03,095\nAuthentication and authorization.\n\n1195\n00:52:03,095 --> 00:52:04,268\nYeah, long episode.\n\n1196\n00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:05,313\nGotta make that a two-parter.\n\n1197\n00:52:05,313 --> 00:52:05,929\nMm-hm.\n\n1198\n00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:06,853\nLot of stuff there, lot of cool stuff.\n\n1199\n00:52:06,853 --> 00:52:07,619\nYep, yeah.\n\n1200\n00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:10,451\nLot, lot of great stuff\non there and- Mm-hm.\n\n1201\n00:52:10,451 --> 00:52:13,121\nWell, I'd, Mike, do,\ndo you have anything to add?\n\n1202\n00:52:13,121 --> 00:52:13,946\nI, I, you know,\n\n1203\n00:52:13,946 --> 00:52:17,870\nI think we've covered just about every\nbit that we can possibly cover on there.\n\n1204\n00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:21,232\nAgain, for this exam, you know, be, mainly\nbe familiar with the different options\n\n1205\n00:52:21,232 --> 00:52:22,936\nthat you have to authenticate with.\n\n1206\n00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:26,676\nYou know we've got passwords,\nwe've got PINs, we've got pictures,\n\n1207\n00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,102\nwe've got certificates.\n\n1208\n00:52:28,102 --> 00:52:32,948\nWe've got the you know, biometrics,\na lot of different methods there.\n\n1209\n00:52:32,948 --> 00:52:33,902\nUnderstand that,\n\n1210\n00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:37,879\nthat again Microsoft Windows 8 supports\nall of those different methods.\n\n1211\n00:52:37,879 --> 00:52:40,529\nAs we just saw today,\nwe can configure multiple methods and\n\n1212\n00:52:40,529 --> 00:52:43,116\nthen use whichever one's convenient for\nus.\n\n1213\n00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:44,147\nOh yeah.\n\n1214\n00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:48,663\nYep, and multi-factor authentication\nusing more than one, right?\n\n1215\n00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:51,021\nMm-hm.\nAnd a user name and a password,\n\n1216\n00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:53,829\nthose are both something that you know,\ncorrect?\n\n1217\n00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:54,885\nMm-hm.\nYes, yes.\n\n1218\n00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:55,860\nOkay.\nYep.\n\n1219\n00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,008\nSo that, so that, so that so\neven though it's two- Mm-hm.\n\n1220\n00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,320\nEntry fields, it does not count as- Yeah,\nthat would not, would not, exactly.\n\n1221\n00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,690\nIt wouldn't be considered multi-factor\ncuz the user account is the object.\n\n1222\n00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,895\nThe password is what you're\nusing to authenticate- Mm.\n\n1223\n00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:10,432\nTo that object, so you're only supplying\none bit of information to prove that\n\n1224\n00:53:10,432 --> 00:53:13,280\nyou're the one that's\nassociated with that account.\n\n1225\n00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,690\nWhereas, if I take that smart card and\n\n1226\n00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,440\nhave to type in a PIN as well, it's still\none account, but I'm using two bits of\n\n1227\n00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,090\ninformation to prove that I'm the person\nthat is authorized to use that account.\n\n1228\n00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:23,950\nMm.\nYep.\n\n1229\n00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,447\nYeah.\nCool, well, what about,\n\n1230\n00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:28,145\nokay what about\nthe the ThinkPad that we had?\n\n1231\n00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:29,410\nUh-huh.\nBecause all I did was just,\n\n1232\n00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:30,310\nI swiped my finger.\n\n1233\n00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,032\nYep.\nAnd that's, that would be single factor.\n\n1234\n00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:32,705\nSingle factor.\n\n1235\n00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:35,010\nSo, there's nothing other, there's no PIN.\n\n1236\n00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:35,854\nYep.\n\n1237\n00:53:35,854 --> 00:53:37,160\nNo user, username?\n\n1238\n00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,280\nThere is, well, no.\n\n1239\n00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,630\nWell, your account is still there.\n\n1240\n00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,750\nSo, you still got your username.\n\n1241\n00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,994\nBut you're just using your fingerprint as\nthe means to authenticate to that account-\n\n1242\n00:53:43,994 --> 00:53:44,744\nMm-hm.\n\n1243\n00:53:44,744 --> 00:53:47,840\nSo it would be considered\na single-factor authentication.\n\n1244\n00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,590\nStill secure, you know, we like that\nhave multi-factor, a little more secure,\n\n1245\n00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:53,240\nbecause I do have to have\ntwo bits of information,\n\n1246\n00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,000\nwhereas a password is\njust easier to break.\n\n1247\n00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,150\nWith the fingerprint though,\n\n1248\n00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,240\nI'm not worried about being single factor,\nbecause difficult to steal my finger.\n\n1249\n00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,840\nUmm.\nAt least without me knowing.\n\n1250\n00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,420\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1251\n00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,048\nHopefully.\nYeah.\n\n1252\n00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:08,246\n[LAUGH] But you could probably\npick up a fingerprint right there.\n\n1253\n00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:08,885\nMm-hm.\n\n1254\n00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:12,910\n[LAUGH] Well, sweet, Mike,\nwell, I guess that's,\n\n1255\n00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,389\nthat's all that I have for\nthis- All right.\n\n1256\n00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:16,245\nFor this these topics.\n\n1257\n00:54:16,245 --> 00:54:17,268\nBeen fun, enjoyed it.\n\n1258\n00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:17,871\nMm-hm.\n\n1259\n00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:19,311\nAnd sweet, yep.\n\n1260\n00:54:19,311 --> 00:54:22,074\nAll right, well that,\nthat wraps it up for for the day.\n\n1261\n00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:23,687\nWe'll yeah.\n\n1262\n00:54:23,687 --> 00:54:27,753\nMake sure you guys check us out on\nITPro.TV or on your Roku device.\n\n1263\n00:54:27,753 -->

another one of our, our one off,\nmini-episodes where we tackle a new\n\n4\n00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,698\nobjective that was added with\nthe January 2014 exam update.\n\n5\n00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:24,152\nSo, today we are gonna take a look at some\nof the new authentication stuff that's\n\n6\n00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:25,734\nbeen added in you know?\n\n7\n00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,491\nAnd mainly having to deal\nwith user accounts and, and\n\n8\n00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:32,678\nhow they function on a Windows 8\nmachine or a Windows 8.1 machine right?\n\n9\n00:00:32,678 --> 00:00:35,270\nThat was the whole point of the update.\n\n10\n00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,095\nSo so we don't have anything today\nthat is shockingly new and exciting.\n\n11\n00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,750\n>> Yeah.\nBut there are things that were\n\n12\n00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,715\ncalled out on the exam objective\nthat didn't use to be there.\n\n13\n00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,620\nAnd so we want to make sure that\nwe cover that in depth, and so\n\n14\n00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,870\nyou don't get any surprises on the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,430\nSo, we're gonna actually take a look at\nthe idea of using virtual smart cards.\n\n17\n00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,070\nNow, this is the one where, where for us,\n\n18\n00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,930\nit's gonna actually be a little\nbit unusual in the very fact that\n\n19\n00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,420\nwe like the idea of using smart cards,\na physical device.\n\n20\n00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,270\nBut now we're actually talking about\none that's going to be built into\n\n21\n00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,510\nWindows itself, and in terms of\nthe actual hardware that we have.\n\n22\n00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,340\n>> And now, if you're not familiar with\nsmart cards, the idea is that when you log\n\n23\n00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,610\ninto your computer,\ninstead of just having a user name and\n\n24\n00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,960\npassword, that you have\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n25\n00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,010\nSomething you know, like your password.\n\n26\n00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,670\nAnd something you have, like a smart card.\n\n27\n00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,810\nIt looks like a credit card.\n\n28\n00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,520\nIt's got a little microchip in it.\n\n29\n00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,500\nAnd if your computer has a reader for\nthat,\n\n30\n00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,780\nyou slide this credit card looking thing\ninto your computer and, off you go.\n\n31\n00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n32\n00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,600\nWell, the problem is most computers\ndon't have a smart card reader right?\n\n33\n00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,910\nLet me just.\n>> Especially like laptops, and.\n\n34\n00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,430\n>> Yeah, let me,\nlet me bring up a picture here.\n\n35\n00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,652\nSo, so people can kinda see\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n36\n00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:47,040\nIf you, if you've never dealt\nwith smart cards before.\n\n37\n00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,980\nSo I'm just gonna do a quick search for\na smart card.\n\n38\n00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,230\nAnd smart cards they,\nthey look like credit cards.\n\n39\n00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,210\nIn fact, here these guys are just\nshowing a picture of a credit card, and\n\n40\n00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,780\nthen basically you have\na smart card reader.\n\n41\n00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,640\nHere's a good picture.\n\n42\n00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,780\nThis, this is from TechNet.\n\n43\n00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,220\n>> Yeah.\n>> So well I say it's a good picture,\n\n44\n00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,700\nit's pretty low quality.\n\n45\n00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,400\nBut but you'll see here these cards.\n\n46\n00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,160\nYou might have seen them as like,\nhotel room access keys, or\n\n47\n00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,120\nyou may actually have a credit card, or\nstudent ID, or something that has it.\n\n48\n00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,170\nThe chip is actually this\nlittle bit right here.\n\n49\n00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,462\nThe whole rest of\nthe card is just plastic.\n\n50\n00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:19,350\nIt stores about one meg of data, and\nmaybe a little more in some cards.\n\n51\n00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,070\nAnd when inserted into a card reader,\nit can read that data.\n\n52\n00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,230\nAnd with a smart card what you normally\ndo is store a certificate on that card,\n\n53\n00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,640\nand the certificate identifies\nthat you are who you say you are.\n\n54\n00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,580\nAnd if you've got your password or\npin number and you combine that with this\n\n55\n00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,790\ncertificate, that's your\nauthentication to get you into a PC.\n\n56\n00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,560\nIt's a great system.\n\n57\n00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,890\nBut again, you know, my laptop\ndoesn't have a smart card reader.\n\n58\n00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,000\nMy desktop at home doesn't\nhave a smart card reader.\n\n59\n00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,890\nHow about you, Ronnie?\n\n60\n00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,640\nAnything you have?\n\n61\n00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,030\n>> Nope.\nYeah, no, nothing.\n\n62\n00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,260\n>> I don't think I own a single\ndevice with a smart card reader.\n\n63\n00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n64\n00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,038\n>> So if you want to implement them,\nyou've gotta buy smart card reader,\n\n65\n00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:54,555\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n66\n00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:55,096\n>> Right?\n\n67\n00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:57,975\nBut That's not necessarily always true.\n\n68\n00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:00,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can, if your system has a TPM,\n\n69\n00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,710\na Trusted Platform Module, you can store\n\n70\n00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,820\nthe certificate from the smart card\ninto what's called a virtual smart card.\n\n71\n00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,260\nA virtual smart card is one that's stored\nin the TPM on your motherboard, all right?\n\n72\n00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,390\n>> Now, this means you don't go out and\nbuy an actual virtual smartcard.\n\n73\n00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,710\nWhat this means is that you can also use\nWindows 8.1 to help generate an actual\n\n74\n00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,880\nvirtual smartcard for you that then\nwill be housed or stored in the TPM.\n\n75\n00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,130\nSo that we can do the exact same things\nthat we would have done with a physical\n\n76\n00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,400\nsmartcard.\n\n77\n00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,710\nBut now it's actually\non the device itself.\n\n78\n00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,016\nNow the, the advantage of this is that\nseldom are you actually going to leave\n\n79\n00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,520\nyour device somewhere.\n\n80\n00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,350\nWhere as a smart card,\nyou might leave it at home.\n\n81\n00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,120\nYou might, you know,\nlose it by going through, you know, heck,\n\n82\n00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,400\nstanding in line for all you know,\nyou know, getting a burger or something.\n\n83\n00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,170\nBut for us usually the devices themselves,\nwe either have in hand, or in our bag,\n\n84\n00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,550\nand usually that's the last\ndevice that we tend to leave.\n\n85\n00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,610\nSo having it there is there virtually\nstored in that hardware, but it,\n\n86\n00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,860\nit still works as a regular smart card.\n\n87\n00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,859\n>> Yeah, now it is a little\nbit weaker security, right?\n\n88\n00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:05,860\n>> Yeah.\nOne of the nice things about\n\n89\n00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,350\na removable smart card\n\n90\n00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,295\nis that if I walk away from my computer,\nand I take that smart card with me.\n\n91\n00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:09,795\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n92\n00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,820\n>> Nobody can get into my machine\nunless they have my smart card.\n\n93\n00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,827\nThey've got to get it.\n\n94\n00:04:14,827 --> 00:04:16,680\n>> Right.\n>> But if the smart card is in the TPM on\n\n95\n00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,781\nthe mother board, and they take my laptop,\nwell they've got my smart card now, right?\n\n96\n00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:22,958\n>> RIght.\n>> But it's dual factor authentication,\n\n97\n00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:27,100\ntwo things, the smart card combined with\na password or pin number that you know.\n\n98\n00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,150\nSo as long as they don't have that second\npiece, you still get security out of it.\n\n99\n00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,300\nBut if they take the hard drive\nout of your computer, and\n\n100\n00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,120\nstick it in another machine.\n\n101\n00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,420\nThat smart card is now missing.\n\n102\n00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,710\n>> Right.\n>> And the system won't be able to\n\n103\n00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,530\nboot up.\n\n104\n00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,120\nSo that's where we get that extra\nsecurity, is if they, you know,\n\n105\n00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,385\nremove the drives.\n\n106\n00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:44,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n107\n00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,290\nthat's very common on something\nlike a physical server.\n\n108\n00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,690\n>> Right.\n>> That might be installed in\n\n109\n00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,212\na server room.\n\n110\n00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:51,130\nNobody's gonna steal the whole server, but\n\n111\n00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,160\nthey might grab the drives and run\n>> And\n\n112\n00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,575\nthat's the security that you\nget with a virtual smart card.\n\n113\n00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:56,610\n>> Hm-hm.\n\n114\n00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,650\n>> Now, the first requirement, if you\nwant to do a virtual smart card is you\n\n115\n00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,086\nhave to have a TPM,\na Trusted Platform Module.\n\n116\n00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:04,200\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> There's no, no using a USB key for\n\n117\n00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,700\nthis one.\n\n118\n00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,792\nYou've, you've got to have a TPM.\n\n119\n00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:06,860\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n120\n00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,527\nYou know,\nwith a TPM here what we'll end up seeing.\n\n121\n00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,700\nWe're gonna take a look at\na little website, I guess.\n\n122\n00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,590\nThen we'll talk about\nthe actual steps here.\n\n123\n00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,060\nAnd once you actually have that TPM,\n\n124\n00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,390\nthen you can actually run a command that\nwe're gonna see, that will allow us to\n\n125\n00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,030\nessentially generate that particular card,\nand we're ready to go.\n\n126\n00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,750\n>> Yeah, enabling smart card boards\nis actually a pretty big deal.\n\n127\n00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,210\nAnd you're normally going to need to\nset up servers, certificate authority,\n\n128\n00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,350\na domain, you know,\nto make all of this work.\n\n129\n00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,130\nWell on the 70-687 exam,\nthey don't get into all that, you know,\n\n130\n00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,694\nsetting up the certificate server stuff.\n\n131\n00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:41,700\n>> Yeah.\n>> They leave that for the server exams.\n\n132\n00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,040\nAnd so we just need to get kind of\na high level understanding, and\n\n133\n00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,960\nthere's one command in particular\nthat we actually need to know.\n\n134\n00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,440\nSo, Microsoft has a great white paper\ndrawn up on using virtual smart cards, and\n\n135\n00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440\nthat's what I, I, want to show you.\n\n136\n00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,790\nAnd, and we'll post a link to this-\n>> Yeah.\n\n137\n00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,880\n>> With the video on the site.\n\n138\n00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,150\nSo you can, you can go and\nlook at it there too.\n\n139\n00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,880\nBut but basically what they\ndo is in the white paper,\n\n140\n00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,120\nthey go through how you set\nup the certificate server.\n\n141\n00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,312\nWhich is not something we need to know for\nthis exam.\n\n142\n00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:07,120\n>> Hm-hm, right.\n>> And you'll see,\n\n143\n00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,795\nthat's what the bulk of\nthe instructions are.\n\n144\n00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:10,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Almost all of this here\n\n145\n00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,325\nis talking about getting that\ncertificate server set up.\n\n146\n00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:13,010\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n147\n00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,410\n>> And then it's not until here that\nwe get to the actual setting up\n\n148\n00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,820\nof the of the, the smart, the,\nthe virtual smart card, right?\n\n149\n00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n150\n00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,310\nAnd you gotta love Microsoft for this.\n\n151\n00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,395\nThey, of course, never create\na fairly small command for us.\n\n152\n00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:26,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This one,\n\n153\n00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,790\nif you actually take a look at it,\nsays TPM.\n\n154\n00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,250\nSo, at the beginning is TPM here for\ntrusted platform module.\n\n155\n00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,038\nVirtual smart card, VSC, MGR.\n\n156\n00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,950\nSo, TPM virtualSmartCardManager.exe\nis the overall command\n\n157\n00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,520\nthat we actually really need to\nunderstand if we are asked or\n\n158\n00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,640\nif we are going to implement the use\nof virtual smart cards for Windows 8.1.\n\n159\n00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,170\n>> Yeah, now what they're doing\nhere with this command and this,\n\n160\n00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,505\nthis is the command we need\nto be aware for the exam.\n\n161\n00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:54,670\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n>> This is really out of all of this,\n\n162\n00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,220\nthe only thing that's truly gonna turn up.\n\n163\n00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,290\nAnd you'll see here what they're doing\nis they're generating a random key.\n\n164\n00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,330\nSo they're, they're generating a key for\nthis machine, and\n\n165\n00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,220\nthen storing it in the TPM.\n\n166\n00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,290\nThat's why they're,\nthey're calling the TPM here.\n\n167\n00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,000\nSo this is what actually creates that\nsmart card and sticks it in there.\n\n168\n00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,321\nBut, It needs to come from a domain\ncertificate authentication server, a cer,\n\n169\n00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:17,768\ncertification authority.\n\n170\n00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:18,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n171\n00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,570\nSo so\nwe gotta pull from that domain entity.\n\n172\n00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,450\nAnd that's what this key\nis really designed to do.\n\n173\n00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,825\nOnce it's there, it's actually\nreaching out in the background and\n\n174\n00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:29,615\ntrying to enroll if\nyou've got a domain CA.\n\n175\n00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,975\nIf you don't have a domain\nCA you can manually do it.\n\n176\n00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:34,855\nAnd that's what the rest of the article\naddresses, is manually going in and\n\n177\n00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:35,755\ngetting that certificate.\n\n178\n00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,325\n>> Mm.\n\n179\n00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,415\n>> But if you just run this\ncommand as it's listed here,\n\n180\n00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:42,980\nyou'll see slash name, so that's\ncreating a name for the certificate.\n\n181\n00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,822\nYour TPMVSC, or Trusted Platform Module\nVirtual Smart Card, slash PIN default.\n\n182\n00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:52,900\nThey're saying, use the same PIN number I\nused when I log into the machine anyway.\n\n183\n00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,690\nSlash admin key, so here's the,\nthe private key it's gonna use.\n\n184\n00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,012\nRandom, that means it's going to make\none and it's going to generate it, so\n\n185\n00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,456\nit's going to be self-signed.\n\n186\n00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:03,441\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> If we leave that generate off then,\n\n187\n00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,795\nthen we're going to be reaching out\na domain CA to get it, all right?\n\n188\n00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:10,147\nBut that's what's creating that\nentire virtual smart card and\n\n189\n00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:13,719\nstuffing it into the TPM, where it\ncan then be called as you need it.\n\n190\n00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:14,677\nAll right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n191\n00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:15,910\n>> I'll be honest with you guys.\n\n192\n00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,430\nIf your company is serious\nenough to need smart cards,\n\n193\n00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,950\nthey're not gonna go\nwith virtual smart cards.\n\n194\n00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,020\nThey'll go with real ones.\n\n195\n00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,120\nIt's not that expensive.\n\n196\n00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,780\nThe cards themselves\nare like $0.50 these days.\n\n197\n00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,130\nThe readers are usually $10 to $15.\n\n198\n00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,096\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, so, the,\n\n199\n00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:31,880\nit's not an incredibly\nexpensive technology.\n\n200\n00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,715\nGoing virtual gives you\nsome of the benefits.\n\n201\n00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But it doesn't give you the same level\n\n202\n00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760\nof security.\n\n203\n00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,230\nSo while this feature is supported,\nand while it's kinda neat.\n\n204\n00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's not something a lot of people\n\n205\n00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,560\nare gonna use because you can get\nthe same functionality with BitLocker.\n\n206\n00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,370\n>> Right.\n\n207\n00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,960\n>> So yeah so, just,\njust keep that in mind.\n\n208\n00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,210\nBut the functionality is there,\nand while it wasn't in the past,\n\n209\n00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,000\nit is now called out on the exam.\n\n210\n00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,479\nSo, at least take a minute to read-\n>> Yep.\n\n211\n00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:59,390\n>> Over this article, and, and\nkinda get familiar with it.\n\n212\n00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,050\nBut for the most part, you're not really\ngonna see all that much on the exam,\n\n213\n00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,605\nexcept for that one command,\nwhich I've now scrolled away from.\n\n214\n00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:06,880\n>> [LAUGH] It's a long command.\n\n215\n00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n216\n00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,339\nThat, that guy right there.\n\n217\n00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,196\n>> Yeah.\n\n218\n00:09:09,196 --> 00:09:11,260\n>> Which enables us to go ahead and,\n\n219\n00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,298\nand generate that certificate and\nstore it in the CPM.\n\n220\n00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:14,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n221\n00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,700\n>> All right.\n\n222\n00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,480\nSo so that's about it for that one.\n\n223\n00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,600\nNow we've got two other new\nones that were added in here,\n\n224\n00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440\nlet's, let's find them here.\n\n225\n00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,480\nSo we've got configure\nvirtual smart cards.\n\n226\n00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,930\nWe also have configuring authentication\nin workgroups and domains,\n\n227\n00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,505\nso how users authenticate\nagainst our system.\n\n228\n00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:31,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then last,\n\n229\n00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,680\nwe've got some UAC stuff.\n\n230\n00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,440\nSo let's, let's talk about authenticating\nIn workgroups and domains.\n\n231\n00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,130\n>> Okay.\n\n232\n00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,855\nRemember that really our primary security\nthat we tend to actually use for\n\n233\n00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,369\nour computers, right.\n\n234\n00:09:42,369 --> 00:09:47,174\nI turn on my computer, I can actually just\nenter in a regular password if I want to\n\n235\n00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:51,290\nand once it actually has my username and\npassword, I am ready to go.\n\n236\n00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,020\nOkay.\n\n237\n00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,280\nNow, when I do that I have two options.\n\n238\n00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,038\nI can either authenticate against\na security database on my local machine or\n\n239\n00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:02,549\nI can authenticate against\na database somewhere else.\n\n240\n00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:03,577\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n241\n00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:06,730\nYeah, so you know, when we have a machine,\nif we're in a small environment,\n\n242\n00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,400\nif you only have you know, four or\nfive computers or something like that,\n\n243\n00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,905\nthen you may be managing your user\naccounts individually on each machine.\n\n244\n00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's very, very common, right?\n\n245\n00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,540\nTo see that for example here, let's,\nlet's take my my client machine.\n\n246\n00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,325\nAnd if I go into my Control Panel.\n\n247\n00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,555\nOh, machine's kinda running\na little slow today, isn't it?\n\n248\n00:10:27,555 --> 00:10:29,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I, I'll go into my Control Panel,\n\n249\n00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,760\nand in my Control Panel I've\ngot user accounts.\n\n250\n00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,290\nAnd I can go in here, and\nI can create user accounts.\n\n251\n00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,070\nWell, I have to click on User Accounts\ntwice, cuz that makes sense.\n\n252\n00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,660\nBut I can see that I've got this\nAdministrator that I'm logged\n\n253\n00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,580\nin right now.\n\n254\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,760\nBut but if I go to Manage User Accounts,\nhere we go.\n\n255\n00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,620\nI can see that I've got one\nuser account named Admin.\n\n256\n00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,410\nAnd I can start to add in\nmore user accounts, so\n\n257\n00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,950\nI could create an account for\nme, specifically.\n\n258\n00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,850\nAnd, oh you know what, I'm,\nI'm joined to a domain, shoot.\n\n259\n00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,770\nSo, when you're joined to a domain,\n\n260\n00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,050\nyour user accounts are being managed\nby a centralized entity, all right?\n\n261\n00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,600\nIn a small environment,\nyou don't need that.\n\n262\n00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,040\nYou can create user accounts on each\nindividual machine and, and that's fine.\n\n263\n00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,670\nRight?\n\n264\n00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,820\nBut, in a domain,\nyou have a central authority.\n\n265\n00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,330\nSo let me, I gonna drop down to my laptop,\n\n266\n00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,370\nbecause my laptop is\nnot joined to a domain.\n\n267\n00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,260\nHere we go.\nSo this, this is my laptop, and\n\n268\n00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,118\nI've, I'm running Windows 8.1.\n\n269\n00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:22,830\nGranted it has the ITProTV logo,\nbut otherwise it's there.\n\n270\n00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, so let me just go,\n\n271\n00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:28,735\nI'm gonna go to that same screen\nthat I was going to a second ago.\n\n272\n00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:31,680\nNotice mine says User Accounts and\nFamily Safety?\n\n273\n00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,605\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You'll lose that\n\n274\n00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:34,990\nfamily safety part when you join a domain.\n\n275\n00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,400\nSo so when I go in here,\nI can go to my user accounts.\n\n276\n00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,550\nAnd here, I see my account.\n\n277\n00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:48,450\nAnd if I go to let's see, if I want to\nmanage another account, there we go.\n\n278\n00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,970\nI can see I've got me and\n\n279\n00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,379\nGuest, and I can add new users-\n>> Yeah.\n\n280\n00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,420\n>> If I want.\n\n281\n00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,870\nSo if I wanna add somebody else in,\nI can come in here to Add an Account and\n\n282\n00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,320\nI can start to create user accounts.\n\n283\n00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,400\nNow these are gonna be right here, on this\nmachine, individually on this computer.\n\n284\n00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,775\nSo if I create an account for,\nfor Ronnie, right?\n\n285\n00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:08,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well, you know,\n\n286\n00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,899\nit's pushing me here to\ndo a Microsoft account.\n\n287\n00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I'm gonna do this, sign-in without,\n\n288\n00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,910\nlook it's gray text on a gray background.\n\n289\n00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,330\n>> Yeah, love it.\n>> They really don't want you to see that.\n\n290\n00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:16,950\n>> Yeah.\n\n291\n00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,620\n>> But I'm gonna sign in\nwithout a Microsoft account.\n\n292\n00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,920\nAnd I'll create an account for Ronnie.\n\n293\n00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,520\nIt's probably not gonna\nlike that password, is it?\n\n294\n00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,340\nThat did it.\n\n295\n00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,770\nHey, I could even flag\nyou as a child account.\n\n296\n00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,950\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n>> But so I can go ahead and create that.\n\n297\n00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,330\nNow, Ronnie has an account on my machine.\n\n298\n00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,370\nAnd if he wanted to log into my laptop,\nhe could.\n\n299\n00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:38,980\nAll right.\n\n300\n00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,410\nNow he's got an account\non his laptop already.\n\n301\n00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,040\nNow he's got an account on mine.\n\n302\n00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,820\nThose are two separate accounts.\n\n303\n00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,370\n>> Right.\n\n304\n00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,390\n>> If he changes his password on his\nlaptop, it does not change on this one.\n\n305\n00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,040\n>> Yep.\n>> They're, they're separate, right?\n\n306\n00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,670\nBut if you've only got four or\nfive computers, it's not a big deal.\n\n307\n00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,999\nAnd Ronnie never uses my laptop.\n\n308\n00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:54,519\n>> Nope.\n\n309\n00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,880\n>> I never use his.\nSo it doesn't really matter you know,\n\n310\n00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,020\nwhether we have those accounts or not.\n\n311\n00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,135\nIt's not something we worry about.\n\n312\n00:12:59,135 --> 00:12:59,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n313\n00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,526\n>> But in an enterprise environment,\nlet's say you have 5,000 computers,\n\n314\n00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:07,110\nand maybe you login on\ndifferent computers every day.\n\n315\n00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,480\n>> Mm.\n>> You need it where if you change\n\n316\n00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,430\nyour password on one, it's changed\nthroughout the entire environment.\n\n317\n00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,580\nAnd that's where a domain comes in handy.\n\n318\n00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,590\nA domain controller gives us that\ncentralized database of user accounts.\n\n319\n00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,080\nSo that if I change my password,\nit changes in the database and\n\n320\n00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,470\nevery other computer\nbecomes aware of that.\n\n321\n00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,130\nAnd it's all nice and centrally managed.\n\n322\n00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,810\n>> Yeah.\n\n323\n00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,740\nSo this is where that advantage of\nthat domain really does help us.\n\n324\n00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,800\nBecause when we now log in,\nwith that domain account, it doesn't check\n\n325\n00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,530\nright here and say hey, your your, your\njust you know, your account's not here.\n\n326\n00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,010\nIt does actually go out and check it, and\n\n327\n00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,720\nthen when it actually does that, it then\ngoes out and checks the domain and says,\n\n328\n00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,640\nhey, is this actually\na user on the network here?\n\n329\n00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,400\nIf it is, it still allows you\nto actually then be able log in.\n\n330\n00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,170\nThe advantage of that for\na regular user is simple.\n\n331\n00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,420\nThis means we don't have to go\nto every single computer and\n\n332\n00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,280\nactually create an account so\nwe can actually log in.\n\n333\n00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,460\nWe now allow those individual computers\ninside of that domain grouping\n\n334\n00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,520\nto now be able to check against\na centralized database, and\n\n335\n00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,920\nthat's what makes it so powerful.\n\n336\n00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,759\n>> And\nthat's what we're seeing on this machine.\n\n337\n00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,141\n>> Yep.\n>> When I went to Manage User Accounts,\n\n338\n00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:17,172\nright, it showed me a different screen\nthan what I got on my laptop, and when I\n\n339\n00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:21,530\nwent to Add, it was saying, all right,\nwe're gonna add a user, pick the domain.\n\n340\n00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n341\n00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,300\nIt knows that,\nhey if we're creating users,\n\n342\n00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,160\nthey need to be in that\ncentralized domain.\n\n343\n00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,880\nAnd so if I wanna create a user for\nRonnie Wong, for the domain,\n\n344\n00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,150\nI can browse and pick my, my domain.\n\n345\n00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,630\nNo location.\n>> Looks like you have to do Contoso.\n\n346\n00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,670\n>> Oh, that didn't work.\n\n347\n00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,080\nAll right?\nSo I'll type in my domain here.\n\n348\n00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,770\nAnd.\n\n349\n00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:44,860\n>> Maybe.\n\n350\n00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,990\n>> No locations can be found.\n\n351\n00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,262\nThat's interesting.\n\n352\n00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, well I'll just type it in\n\n353\n00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,120\nmanually and see what happens here.\n\n354\n00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,485\nBut oh there we go, all right.\n\n355\n00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:54,425\nSo, so it's gonna reach out and\ntry and create that account.\n\n356\n00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:55,965\nAnd put it in the domain.\n\n357\n00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:58,645\nSee how it's contoso.com/ronniewong?\n\n358\n00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:02,135\nA local user account would be\nthe computer name slash Ronnie Wong.\n\n359\n00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,985\nThis one is showing the domain\nname slash Ronnie Wong.\n\n360\n00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:08,605\nAnd what it's actually doing, is reaching\nout in the background to a server, and\n\n361\n00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,570\nI've got this server back here.\n\n362\n00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,400\nAnd this server is,\nis what's called a domain controller.\n\n363\n00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,950\nAnd a domain controller is\njust a server running that\n\n364\n00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,000\ncentralized database of user accounts.\n\n365\n00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000\nAnd in Windows,\nthat is called a active directory.\n\n366\n00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,315\nAnd apparently I've, I've stalled too\nlong and my session has timed out.\n\n367\n00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:27,809\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But but\n\n368\n00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:32,110\nit's called an active directory, and\nit's just a collection of user accounts,\n\n369\n00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,750\nyou know, and, and\ncomputer accounts and groups you know,\n\n370\n00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,480\nall that stuff that we can manage locally,\nall kind of stuck here in one place.\n\n371\n00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,380\nYeah, my, my session has timed out.\n\n372\n00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,674\nSo.\n\n373\n00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,140\nWell, apparently my whole\nsession is timed out, wonderful.\n\n374\n00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,089\nSo, anyhow,\nwe can create that in the domain.\n\n375\n00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,502\nIf you wanna learn more about the domain\nside of things, well in the 70-687 and\n\n376\n00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:55,549\n70-688 exam,\nthose are the workstation exams, so\n\n377\n00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:58,493\nthey really don't get into\ndomains too terribly much.\n\n378\n00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:02,622\nBut if you jump over to like the 70-410\nshow, which is the, the Windows Server\n\n379\n00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:06,286\n2012 show, we show you how to create\ndomains, how to manage those user\n\n380\n00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:08,720\naccounts, how to do group policy objects-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n381\n00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,602\n>> Which are really awesome.\n\n382\n00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,410\nAnd kind of tackle that environment.\n\n383\n00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,740\nSo if you want to learn more about it,\ndefinitely jump over there.\n\n384\n00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,204\nBut for the sake of the 70-687 exam,\nwhat they're really looking for is for you\n\n385\n00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:22,606\nto understand that there is a centralized\ndatabase of user accounts in a domain, and\n\n386\n00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:26,390\nall of the computers are tied\nto that centralized database.\n\n387\n00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,140\nBut when you're in a workroom, every\ncomputer maintains its own database of,\n\n388\n00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,910\nof user accounts.\n\n389\n00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,040\nAnd so you've got different\naccounts on different computers.\n\n390\n00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,660\nAll right.\n\n391\n00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,340\nThe last thing that was added in the new\nexam update, was the UAC settings.\n\n392\n00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,790\nNow UAC,\nlet me bring the objectives back up.\n\n393\n00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,590\nHere we go.\nUAC if you're not familiar with it,\n\n394\n00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,640\nis User Account Control.\n\n395\n00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,110\nAnd I think most people\nare familiar with it,\n\n396\n00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,810\nbecause it was introduced\nin Windows Vista.\n\n397\n00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,370\n>> Yeah, now the UAC for\n\n398\n00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,000\nus really allows us to be able to actually\nset the user account that when they\n\n399\n00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,490\nare created, they're not automatically\ngiven administrative privileges.\n\n400\n00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,394\nWhat used to happen was when you,\nwell this is what happened at my house.\n\n401\n00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:08,197\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where it was just fairly simple,\n\n402\n00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:11,959\nlet me put it this way, is that when I log\nin and I was the first account created,\n\n403\n00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,180\nI got administrative privileges.\n\n404\n00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,230\nNow even though I went ahead and\ncreated a separate account for my wife and\n\n405\n00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,140\nmy daughter.\n\n406\n00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,685\nThey never logged in with their account.\n\n407\n00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,185\nThey've always stayed logged in with mine.\n\n408\n00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:21,687\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n409\n00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,710\n>> And so no matter what they did\nthey ran as an actual administrator.\n\n410\n00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,030\nSo that meant if they went to a website\nit said download this and it would work.\n\n411\n00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,990\nBecause it gave them\nadministrative privileges.\n\n412\n00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,325\nNow that's actually something that's not\nexactly the greatest thing in the world.\n\n413\n00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n414\n00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,920\nreally beginning with Vista they said,\nlook, for\n\n415\n00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,690\nan individual user, we don't want that.\n\n416\n00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,180\nWe want everybody to log in with what\nwe call standard user privileges here,\n\n417\n00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,200\nnot as administrators, and\n\n418\n00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,140\nthen you'll elevate those privileges\nwhen you really need them.\n\n419\n00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,211\n>> You gave the example of your wife and\ndaughter, but\n\n420\n00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:55,101\nit can even happen to\nyou as an administrator.\n\n421\n00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:59,243\nIf I log in as an administrator And I go\nto a website that tries to install drive\n\n422\n00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:03,712\nby malware, well [LAUGH] if I launch the\nweb browser running under my credentials,\n\n423\n00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:06,627\nthat web browser is now\nrunning as an administrator,\n\n424\n00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,080\nwhich is a, a security concern.\n\n425\n00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,050\nSo with UAC it says even if you are an\nadministrator, when you run applications,\n\n426\n00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,400\nthey run as regular users and\nit protects us from that scenario.\n\n427\n00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,870\nAnd then when you try to do something\nthat requires administrator privileges,\n\n428\n00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:25,390\nyou get the UAC prompt,\nthe User Account Control prompt.\n\n429\n00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,196\nAnd it's a prompt that says; such and\n\n430\n00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:30,143\nsuch program is trying to perform\nan administrative action.\n\n431\n00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,726\nDo you want to allow it right?\n\n432\n00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,476\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you're an administrator.\n\n433\n00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:36,691\nIf you're not an administrator the prompt\nsays this action requires that you\n\n434\n00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,685\nare an administrator.\n\n435\n00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:38,352\n>> Yeah.\n\n436\n00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:39,435\n>> Please provide a username and password.\n\n437\n00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:40,601\nRight?\n\n438\n00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:44,144\nSo it's helping to protect us from\npotentially malicious software.\n\n439\n00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:46,308\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Running with higher privileges than we\n\n440\n00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:46,893\nwanted to.\n\n441\n00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,560\nNow that is a good thing.\n\n442\n00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,246\nBut I remember when it first came out,\nwe all remember,\n\n443\n00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:56,419\nthere were some Apple commercials about it\nyou know verify, verify you know, and it,\n\n444\n00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,100\nand it really did prompt you a lot.\n\n445\n00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,601\n>> Every time.\n\n446\n00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:02,742\n>> They've evolved the prompt quite a bit,\nit's much better under newer systems than\n\n447\n00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,701\nit used to be, but but there are some\nbehaviors that we can change if we want to\n\n448\n00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:09,935\nmodify it, and that's really what\nthey are talking about here.\n\n449\n00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:13,852\nIn the new objective they want you\nto be aware of how we can change.\n\n450\n00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,476\n>> Right.\n>> That prompt, not disable it.\n\n451\n00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:17,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n452\n00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,290\n>> Yeah, you can disable it.\n\n453\n00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,150\nOn the exam if they\n\n454\n00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,476\never had the option to disable-\n>> No.\n\n455\n00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:23,060\n>> That's the wrong answer, right,\nand you will get that question wrong.\n\n456\n00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,492\nSo so we never wanna disable it but\n\n457\n00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:29,226\nwe can tweak exactly how it\npresents us that information.\n\n458\n00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:29,893\n>> Yeah.\n\n459\n00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,726\nI remember in the days of Vista you used\nto either turn it on or turn it off.\n\n460\n00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:34,226\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There was no in between.\n\n461\n00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:38,060\nNo way to actually kind of tweak it or\nset it the way that you want to.\n\n462\n00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,835\nBut today, though,\nit has evolved much better, and\n\n463\n00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:43,686\nyou can actually set\ndifferent levels in the.\n\n464\n00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:46,405\n>> Yeah, let's, let's go back to that\nmachine I was using a moment ago,\n\n465\n00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:49,490\nalthough I almost hesitate to\nbecause it was kind of running slow.\n\n466\n00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,800\nBut, but I'm gonna go back\ninto my control panel, and\n\n467\n00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,360\nI'll go back into the user screen\nwhere we were just a moment ago.\n\n468\n00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,440\nAll right.\n\n469\n00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,800\nWhen were looking at\nuser accounts in here,\n\n470\n00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,390\nyou'll see change user\naccount control settings.\n\n471\n00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,950\nAll right.\n\n472\n00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,590\nThis is changed on a per user basis.\n\n473\n00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,860\nSo if you've got one user or\n\n474\n00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,350\nten users you can go through and\nchange them individually.\n\n475\n00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,720\nSo I'm about to change the UAC settings\nfor this administrator account.\n\n476\n00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,375\nAnd when I go to change it I\nget this screen right here.\n\n477\n00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,851\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now let me let me zoom in on that.\n\n478\n00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,896\nSo we can kinda get a, a better,\noh you know what, I'm,\n\n479\n00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:27,185\nI'm doing that crazy double mouse thing.\n\n480\n00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,268\nLet me, there.\n\n481\n00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:28,894\nAll right.\n\n482\n00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,436\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n483\n00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,226\nbasically it's saying\nchoose when to be notified.\n\n484\n00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:34,509\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When do we get bothered about,\n\n485\n00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:35,144\nyou know?\n\n486\n00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:38,262\nAuthentication access and stuff and\nyou'll see the default setting for\n\n487\n00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:39,480\nthis administrator.\n\n488\n00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,980\nThere is a slider with four notches and\nit's the third notch up.\n\n489\n00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,810\nSo it actually a higher level\nthat says always notify.\n\n490\n00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,740\nWe are kind of in between.\n\n491\n00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,900\nSo lets take a look at\neach of those levels and\n\n492\n00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,920\nI am going to go all the way to the top.\n\n493\n00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,760\nTop first, all right.\n\n494\n00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,400\nSo what, we'll start here and\nkind of go through each one.\n\n495\n00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,935\nAll right.\n\n496\n00:20:56,935 --> 00:21:00,435\nSo at the highest level it says any time.\n\n497\n00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,277\n>> Yeah.\n>> A program tries to install software or\n\n498\n00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:08,143\nmake changes to my system, or\nif I make changes to Windows, notify me.\n\n499\n00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,435\nBring up a box and\nwarn me about that change.\n\n500\n00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n501\n00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,230\nThis is by far the most secure\nsetting that we have, and\n\n502\n00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,910\nit acts as close as to the original\nwhen they actually first did it.\n\n503\n00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,120\nNow, this is when you would go and\nlaunch a command prompt at times, and\n\n504\n00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,280\nit would say hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n505\n00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,870\nAnd you'd just, you know,\nit would get annoying.\n\n506\n00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,870\nEvery time you had a chance where\nyou made a change in program files.\n\n507\n00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,820\nYou went in, like I said, launching\na command prompt, it always notified you.\n\n508\n00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,190\nSo people really did not like this.\n\n509\n00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,560\nSo, by default, when they actually started\nreleasing new versions they tweaked it and\n\n510\n00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,550\nthey started separating these things out.\n\n511\n00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,980\nAnd now today that third,\nonce just you see that highest level.\n\n512\n00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,054\nMost of the time people like that third\nlevel which is why they set it at\n\n513\n00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:52,226\nthe default, and, yep.\n\n514\n00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:57,013\n>> So the third level says, you know, do\nnotify me, notify me when a program tries\n\n515\n00:21:57,013 --> 00:22:01,740\nto make changes or tries to install, but\ndon't notify me when I make changes.\n\n516\n00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,726\n>> Yeah.\n>> To the Windows settings.\n\n517\n00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:04,650\nWhen I wanna go and\nchange the system clock or whatever don't,\n\n518\n00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,893\ndon't bother notifying me about that.\n\n519\n00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:07,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz I'm the one doing it.\n\n520\n00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,415\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, so if I,\n\n521\n00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:10,893\nif I didn't mean to do it,\nI wouldn't have done it.\n\n522\n00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:11,685\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n523\n00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:12,185\n>> That's what we're saying.\n\n524\n00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:13,477\nAnd that's kind of our default.\n\n525\n00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:15,385\nThat still gives use notifications.\n\n526\n00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:18,018\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But reduces the, the flood I guess.\n\n527\n00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:22,325\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right the next level down says\n\n528\n00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:27,730\nnotify me only when apps try to\nmake changes to my computer.\n\n529\n00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,210\nDo not dim my desktop.\n\n530\n00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,230\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n531\n00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,400\nNow that do not dim my desktop.\n\n532\n00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,980\nDo you remember the official name for\nthat Ronnie?\n\n533\n00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,680\nIt's got an official name.\n\n534\n00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,550\n>> It's no I don't remember.\n\n535\n00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,240\nYeah.\n>> Nate would know it.\n\n536\n00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,410\nNate, Nate can hear me.\n\n537\n00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,518\nIf you can remember it, Nate, what, what's\nthat called when they dim the desktop?\n\n538\n00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:41,685\n>> Secure desktop.\n>> Secure desktop!\n\n539\n00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:42,819\nThank you.\n\n540\n00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,685\nNate our producer's off, offscreen.\n\n541\n00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:45,435\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah,\n\n542\n00:22:45,435 --> 00:22:47,935\na wealth,\na wealth of information sometimes.\n\n543\n00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:50,643\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH] On this, great.\n\n544\n00:22:50,643 --> 00:22:52,226\n>> So, so they call it secure desktop.\n\n545\n00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:53,810\nWhen you get prompted-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n546\n00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,018\n>> For\nperforming an administrative action.\n\n547\n00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:59,033\nThe background screen will dim out and,\nbasically,\n\n548\n00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:01,518\nall the software on your computer freezes.\n\n549\n00:23:01,518 --> 00:23:02,101\nNow-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n550\n00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,726\n>> I would like to show that to you guys.\n\n551\n00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:05,736\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it would freeze my laptop,\n\n552\n00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:07,655\nwhich would stop my screen share, so I,\n\n553\n00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:10,200\nit, actually,\nwon't let me show that to you guys.\n\n554\n00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,050\nWell, you know, I might be able to do it\nin a virtual machine, but then anyhow.\n\n555\n00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,890\nYeah.\n>> So the idea is they wanna stop\n\n556\n00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,550\nprograms from running\nlike an auto clicker.\n\n557\n00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,110\n>> Yeah.\n>> They could just click on OK\n\n558\n00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,940\non that button.\n\n559\n00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,720\nSo it freezes what's going\non until you answer.\n\n560\n00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,285\nAll right?\n\n561\n00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:25,320\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n562\n00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,880\n>> If you go down to this tier\nyou'll get the notification but\n\n563\n00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,960\nit won't freeze what's\ngoing on in the background.\n\n564\n00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,520\nIn other words programs might\nbe able to bypass the prompt.\n\n565\n00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,940\nThis makes it less secure but\n\n566\n00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,390\nit does make things run faster-\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n567\n00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,945\n>> Over like, remote desktop connections.\n\n568\n00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:39,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Remote desktop\n\n569\n00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,590\nfreaks out a little bit\nwhen you these UAC prompts.\n\n570\n00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,430\nIt gets really slow and so\nthis can kind of speed that up.\n\n571\n00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,000\n>> Yeah.\n\n572\n00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,610\nOkay, now speaking on that, on that third\nlevel when we talk about that secure\n\n573\n00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,390\ndesktop, the nice thing is\nafter a while it will time out.\n\n574\n00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,120\nSo in other words, let's say a potential\nmalware does get on your computer and\n\n575\n00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920\nit tries to run in the background.\n\n576\n00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,740\nIt freezes it until you make a decision.\n\n577\n00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,490\nWell, what if you don't make a decision?\n\n578\n00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,358\nWell, the default is no, don't accept it.\n\n579\n00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:06,274\nWhich is really nice, because that means\nthat, hey, it's not going to actually\n\n580\n00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:08,965\ndefault and timeout and\nthen allow that program to run.\n\n581\n00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:10,481\nJust a really good feature to have.\n\n582\n00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:11,126\nAnd usually,\n\n583\n00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:14,521\nof course Microsoft doesn't recommend\nthat you actually run this level.\n\n584\n00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,137\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n585\n00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:15,822\n>> So you can.\n\n586\n00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,400\nBut they don't really recommend it.\n\n587\n00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,070\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah.\n\n588\n00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,250\n>> And then the one they really don't.\n\n589\n00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,820\n>> Yep. [LAUGH] >> Recommend is the,\nthe fourth option,\n\n590\n00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,040\nwhich effectively disables UAC.\n\n591\n00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n592\n00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,870\n>> If we drop down to\nthat option right there.\n\n593\n00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,570\n>> Yep.\n>> You'll see it says, never.\n\n594\n00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,470\n>> Not. Yeah.\n>> Notify me when apps go to install or\n\n595\n00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,035\nI make changes,\nthis basically turns UAC off.\n\n596\n00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:33,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n597\n00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,730\nI remember when Windows Vista first came\nout, people would say, oh, this programs\n\n598\n00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,910\nbroken and other people would say,\noh, just disable UAC and it'll fine.\n\n599\n00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> And, and that was true,\n\n600\n00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,285\nthat kinda solved it.\n\n601\n00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:43,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But it was really up to the software\n\n602\n00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,610\nvendors to make their\nsoftware UAC compatible.\n\n603\n00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,710\nWe can use compatibility mode\nsettings to solve that now and\n\n604\n00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,720\nmost applications have been updated so\nturning off UAC is typically a bad idea.\n\n605\n00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,640\n>> Yeah, and, and in this instance, right,\n\n606\n00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,760\ndon't forget that there are some\nweird things that end up happening.\n\n607\n00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,460\nSome people say, I can't get this program\nto run, so they turn off UAC which makes\n\n608\n00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,350\nit run, but it could be that they just\ncouldn't get it to install correctly.\n\n609\n00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,405\nSo they essentially disable the heart of a\nsecurity feature in the operating system.\n\n610\n00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:12,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n611\n00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,060\n>> And what they might actually need\nto do is disable it and install it and\n\n612\n00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,240\nthen just turn it back on and\nsee if it still runs.\n\n613\n00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,930\nA lot of times it runs perfectly\nfine after you actually install it.\n\n614\n00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,990\n>> Yeah or you just right click on it and\nchoose run as administrator.\n\n615\n00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,650\n>> Yeah run as administrator.\n\n616\n00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,150\n>> Or whatever.\n>> Yeah.\n\n617\n00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,760\nThere you go.\n\n618\n00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,930\n>> Yeah various things like that work.\n\n619\n00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,670\nAnd, and you know,\nlet me let me see if I can\n\n620\n00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,270\nIf I can get a UAC prompt to come up here\nwhile I'm in this machine, it, you know,\n\n621\n00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,130\nwe've probably all seen\nthem by this point.\n\n622\n00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,750\nCuz they're not, not too.\n\n623\n00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,950\n>> Try and run the command\nprompt of the administrator?\n\n624\n00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,000\n>> Oh, yeah, that would work, wouldn't it?\n\n625\n00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,296\n>> Maybe.\n[LAUGH]\n\n626\n00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:46,876\n>> Oh you know.\n\n627\n00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:47,976\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n628\n00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,920\n>> Nope, apparently it did not, since\nyou're signed on as the administrator.\n\n629\n00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,710\n>> Oh you know,\nwe are at that third level.\n\n630\n00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,290\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n631\n00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,400\nWell, anyhow, it,\nit I guess I could bump it up.\n\n632\n00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,290\nBut but\nbasically you'd get a little prompt, and\n\n633\n00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,480\nI know if I, if I do it on my\nmachine here, I'll try on my laptop.\n\n634\n00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,030\nSo, if I oh,\nI didn't run it as an administrator.\n\n635\n00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,784\nI said I was going to and\nthen I didn't do it.\n\n636\n00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:12,189\n[SOUND]\n>> Nope.\n\n637\n00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:12,860\nYup.\n>> There we go.\n\n638\n00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,550\nYeah, see it blanks out the screen.\n\n639\n00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,580\nSo I get that,\nthat dimming effect on my screen, and\n\n640\n00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,000\nit freezes things in the background, which\nincludes the desktop share from my laptop.\n\n641\n00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,710\nSo, yeah, so we lose that.\n\n642\n00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,810\nBut it is very cool.\n\n643\n00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,400\nYou know, it is a nice feature to have.\n\n644\n00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,610\nPlease try not to disable it.\n\n645\n00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,980\nIf you're in a domain environment\nyou can write a GPO that applies to\n\n646\n00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,570\nall of your machines to\nforce the functionality.\n\n647\n00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,080\nBut, in a workgroup environment you just\ntweak it right on a per user basis like we\n\n648\n00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,010\njust showed you.\n\n649\n00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,180\nIt, it's simple enough and\nyou go through and tweak it.\n\n650\n00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,350\nSo just, just be aware of that.\n\n651\n00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,830\nThose are the things they call out here.\n\n652\n00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,720\nWe readdress this again\nin the server show,\n\n653\n00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,120\ncuz we show,\nshow some GPOs about it there.\n\n654\n00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,240\nBut on the workstation side, just be\naware, there's multiple tiers and if you\n\n655\n00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,010\ngo all the way to the bottom, it's gonna\ndisable it and you don't, don't want that.\n\n656\n00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,510\n>> Right.\n\n657\n00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,430\n>> All right.\n\n658\n00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,220\nSo Ronnie, I think that about wraps us up.\n\n659\n00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,650\nSo we tackled, virtual smart cards.\n\n660\n00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,788\n>> Right.\n>> We've tackled authentication in work\n\n661\n00:27:05,788 --> 00:27:10,250\ngroups and domains, and we took a look at\nUAC behavior and how we can modify that.\n\n662\n00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,255\nThose are some of the new things that\nwere added in in January 2014, so again,\n\n663\n00:27:14,255 --> 00:27:17,780\nthey can be on the exam and actually\nvery likely to be because they're new.\n\n664\n00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,900\n>> Right.\n\n665\n00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,710\nSounds good.\n\n666\n00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,140\n>> Alright, you think of anything\nelse we need to throw in?\n\n667\n00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,062\n>> Nope,\nI think that's pretty good coverage.\n\n668\n00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:25,143\n>> All right, we hope you guys enjoyed it,\n\n669\n00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,602\nand we'll see you in\nthe next ITProTV special.\n\n670\n00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:33,930\n[SOUND]\n\n",

and welcome back to another\nfantastic episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,110\n>> Yeah, man.\n\n6\n00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,340\n>> I am Nate, here with Mike.\n\n7\n00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,060\n>> Hey, hey.\n\n8\n00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,074\n>> All right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n9\n00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:46,008\n>> I always look for\n\n10\n00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:50,363\nsomething to say like, right after that,\nbut nothing, I haven't, yeah.\n\n11\n00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:51,085\n>> After doing so\n\n12\n00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:54,461\nmany of these you kinda run out of\ncool ways to introduce yourself.\n\n13\n00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:56,460\nIt's like, hey guys, it's Mike again.\n\n14\n00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,840\nI'm here with Nate again.\n\n15\n00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,068\n>> Okay, let's just get started.\n\n16\n00:00:59,068 --> 00:00:59,670\n>> Woo hoo!\n\n17\n00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,021\nLet's have some fun now.\n\n18\n00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,889\nWe do have some good stuff to\ntalk about today, don't we?\n\n19\n00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:03,723\n>> We do, we do.\n\n20\n00:01:03,723 --> 00:01:05,390\nWe do have some good stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,250\nToday, the official objective is,\nconfigure Remote Connections.\n\n22\n00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,880\nAnd within this,\nwe have some sub-objectives.\n\n23\n00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,620\nWe have configure Remote Authentication,\nconfigure Remote Desktop settings.\n\n24\n00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,040\nWhich, we've already done Remote Desktop.\n\n25\n00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,192\n>> Okay.\n>> We've done that before.\n\n26\n00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,497\n>> Right.\n>> And so we're substitute it and\n\n27\n00:01:25,497 --> 00:01:27,650\ndo Remote Assistance instead.\n\n28\n00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,410\n>> So if you need a refresher\non your Remote Desktop,\n\n29\n00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,582\nmake sure you check out the other episodes\non itpro.tv and that fancy Roku channel.\n\n30\n00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:35,420\nWoohoo!\n\n31\n00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,840\n>> We have established a VPN\nconnections and authentications.\n\n32\n00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,411\nWe have enabled VPN Reconnect.\n\n33\n00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:46,410\nAnd last, managed broadband.\n\n34\n00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,330\n>> And least.\n\n35\n00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,300\n>> Yeah.\n>> I wanna say at last but not least for\n\n36\n00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,340\nthat one but then least too, yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,960\n>> Yeah, least.\n\n38\n00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,698\nYeah, there's not-\n>> Little tiny.\n\n39\n00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:53,730\nWe don't have to know a whole\nlot about those in this class.\n\n40\n00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,870\n>> Yeah, and from the client\nside not really a whole lot of,\n\n41\n00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,128\nI don't know, I mean I guess you would\nconfigure it on the client but there's-\n\n42\n00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:02,518\n>> Well yeah,\n\n43\n00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:05,980\nas a desktop support technician,\nentry level position, you're gonna\n\n44\n00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,920\nbe the one that's setting those laptops up\nfor those salespeople to take with them.\n\n45\n00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,440\nSo you have to have a basic understanding\nof where you would go to configure it and\n\n46\n00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,770\nthings like that.\n\n47\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,710\nWe don't actually have any,\nI don't have an air card with me.\n\n48\n00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,725\nDo you?\n>> Uh-uh.\n\n49\n00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:19,685\n>> Yeah, but\nagain not super important, but\n\n50\n00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:22,330\nwe'll get to that when we\nget to that segment there.\n\n51\n00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,260\n>> Yep.\n\n52\n00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,995\nAll right, well yeah, so\nthat's what we got going for today.\n\n53\n00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:27,940\n>> Woo-hoo!\n\n54\n00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,825\n>> Now, should we start off with\nanything or just get right back into it?\n\n55\n00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:36,742\n>> Well, I'll tell you what,\nwhy don't we start with talking about,\n\n56\n00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:39,026\nif we look at this we've\ngot Remote Authentication.\n\n57\n00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,311\nLet's talk about what a VPN connection\nis in the first place, right?\n\n58\n00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:46,028\nCuz I think this is our first episode\nwhere we really talked about these\n\n59\n00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:47,867\nremote connections or maybe not?\n\n60\n00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> Even if we have in another episode,\n\n61\n00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,370\nlet's do a little refresh.\n\n62\n00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,581\nWhen we talk about, it's very common\nnowadays to have people working remotely.\n\n63\n00:02:56,581 --> 00:03:01,450\nRight, we used to call them telecommuters,\nworking from home.\n\n64\n00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,140\nSo we've got people that want to be able\nto work from home and connect into my work\n\n65\n00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,530\nnetwork, and to be able to access all\nthose resources at the work network.\n\n66\n00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,437\nI always said shoot, if I can get them to\nwork eight hours a day and then go home\n\n67\n00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:12,792\nand do some more work from home-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,857\n>> Yeah, man, let's set that up right?\n\n69\n00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:17,170\nI mean I'm not paying them for that part.\n\n70\n00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,190\nBut no seriously,\nif they take a day off or something,\n\n71\n00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,690\nthey've gotta be home because the,\nI don't know, roof guy is coming.\n\n72\n00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,960\nThey can now work from home and\nstill be productive.\n\n73\n00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,790\nWhen people travel, salespeople that\nare traveling around the country,\n\n74\n00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,810\naround the world.\n\n75\n00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,580\nThey need to be able to connect back to my\ncorporate network and access resources,\n\n76\n00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,500\ncheck inventories before they make that\nbig sale or whatever the case may be.\n\n77\n00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,550\nWe've got branches offices, where a lot\nof the times the majority of my resources\n\n78\n00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,360\nare back at the corporate office.\n\n79\n00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,520\nAnd so you've got those people out at\nthe branch office that need to be able to\n\n80\n00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,470\naccess those resources.\n\n81\n00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,972\nSo when we looked at these\nremote connection options that's\n\n82\n00:03:55,972 --> 00:04:00,377\nreally what we are trying to do is give\npeople remote access to our networks.\n\n83\n00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:05,333\n>> Mm-hm, now, yeah, so\nwe've got two kinds of VPNs\n\n84\n00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:10,300\nthat I guess sort of,\nwe have site-to-site VPNs.\n\n85\n00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,283\nWhere we have a branch office and\nthe home office, and they've,\n\n86\n00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:19,465\nthe whole place just has\na VPN connection across them.\n\n87\n00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:23,433\nAnd the Remote Access VPN,\nwhich would be for\n\n88\n00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:27,290\nan individual user like the road warrior.\n\n89\n00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,530\nThe guy out there that just\nneeds to fire up a little one,\n\n90\n00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,960\nas opposed to a large one.\n\n91\n00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,740\n>> Exactly, exactly and I guess we\nprobably should take one step back.\n\n92\n00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,055\nI don't know,\ndid we ever define what VPN stood for?\n\n93\n00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:37,600\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n94\n00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,990\n>> We're using acronyms and\nwe don't tell you what it means, right?\n\n95\n00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,790\nVPN is a virtual private network.\n\n96\n00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,080\nAnd when you stop and think about it,\n\n97\n00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,260\nyour corporate network is\nconnected to the Internet, right?\n\n98\n00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,620\nAnd if we're talking about an individual\nuser that's at home or Starbucks or\n\n99\n00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,750\nthe hotel or whatever,\nthey're connected to the Internet.\n\n100\n00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,550\nAnd the Internet is just a big fat mesh\nnetwork, so it makes sense that I should\n\n101\n00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,950\nbe able to allow this user to establish\nconnectivity back to the corporate office.\n\n102\n00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,570\nAnd it's pretty easy.\n\n103\n00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,680\nThe problem is, we're going across\npublic infrastructure, right?\n\n104\n00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,950\nWe're going across the Internet.\n\n105\n00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,760\nAnd I've got sensitive corporate data that\nthere's users trying to retrieve from\n\n106\n00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,010\nthe corporate office.\n\n107\n00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,494\nOr in the case of a site-to-site,\na branch-to-corp,\n\n108\n00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:21,500\nI got sensitive corporate data\ngoing across that tunnel.\n\n109\n00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,010\nAnd so\n\n110\n00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,530\nI need to protect it as it travels across\nthe public portion of that infrastructure.\n\n111\n00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,840\nAnd that’s what a VPN allows me to do.\n\n112\n00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,120\nA VPN, virtual private network,\ncreates a tunnel, if you will.\n\n113\n00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,170\nWe use this tunneling analogy because\nwere gonna take those normal packets and\n\n114\n00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,790\nwe’re gonna wrap them up\ninside another protocol.\n\n115\n00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,580\nWe're gonna encapsulate,\n\n116\n00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,350\nto get back into my big fancy terms-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n117\n00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,660\n>> That you like so much.\n\n118\n00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,130\nWe're gonna encapsulate that normal LAN\npacket inside a tunneling protocol which\n\n119\n00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,115\nis gonna give it a layer of security as it\ntravels across the public infrastructure.\n\n120\n00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:57,455\nThat way if you're sitting out there,\nand I know the way you are.\n\n121\n00:05:57,455 --> 00:06:00,325\nHe starts running those\npacket caps utilities and\n\n122\n00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,315\nhe's trying to capture that data.\n\n123\n00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:03,415\nHe can capture it all he wants.\n\n124\n00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:05,507\nIf it's in my VPN tunnel and\nI've set up my encryption,\n\n125\n00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:06,809\nhe's not gonna be able to read it.\n\n126\n00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:08,923\n>> Now-\n>> So, take that.\n\n127\n00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,677\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, is that a challenge?\n\n128\n00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:12,524\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n129\n00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:13,214\nNo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:15,177\n>> So, before we had VPNs,\n\n131\n00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:20,800\nthese companies, we'll just take,\nlike a site-to-site, right?\n\n132\n00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,050\nA branch office.\n\n133\n00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,780\nThey had leased lines.\n\n134\n00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,268\nAll right, so\nlike T1 lines that are insanely expensive,\n\n135\n00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:29,237\nand they're not terribly fast.\n\n136\n00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,469\n>> 1.544 MB?\n\n137\n00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:35,576\n>> 1.5 megs, something like,\nI mean that's slow.\n\n138\n00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:37,720\n>> But\nback in the day that was pretty darn fast.\n\n139\n00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,055\nI mean when you were coming from\na 33-6 connection or a 56k connection,\n\n140\n00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:45,590\nbecause my other option, right,\nI had dial up at the house.\n\n141\n00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,730\nMy corporate offered me\nthis 1.544 MB connection.\n\n142\n00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,002\nSo I'd go into corporate and\nthen do my Internet surfing from there.\n\n143\n00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:55,718\n>> Yeah all your downloads, right?\n\n144\n00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:56,841\nJust pause everything.\n>> Yeah, cuz I mean they were going much\n\n145\n00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:58,435\nfaster than what I could get at my house.\n\n146\n00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:01,770\nAnd that does bring up a good point\nbecause when we talk about remote access,\n\n147\n00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,890\nwe can't forget about dial up.\n\n148\n00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,725\nI mean VPN is one type of remote access\nthat we can do where we're sending our\n\n149\n00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:13,030\nTCP/IP packets over the Internet there,\nbut dial up is still out there.\n\n150\n00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,690\nWe don't like to think about it,\nbut it is still an option and\n\n151\n00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,928\na lot of times it's still there for\na backup.\n\n152\n00:07:19,928 --> 00:07:22,034\nRight, cuz if my ISP goes down,\n\n153\n00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:26,731\nall of a sudden my branch office\ncan't connect to my corporate office.\n\n154\n00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:30,071\nAnd everybody out there at the branch\noffice is now doing nothing,\n\n155\n00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:34,220\nmaking me no money, and I'm paying them,\nso we lose productivity.\n\n156\n00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,400\nWhereas if I have that dial up connection,\nit might be a little slow, but it's there.\n\n157\n00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,748\nIf we have anything that has to happen,\nwe can still get that done.\n\n158\n00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:46,144\nAny replication that might need\nto occur or something like that.\n\n159\n00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:50,959\nSo, do remember that VPN is just one type\nof remote access that we can set up.\n\n160\n00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,811\nAnd it's more common, but\nthere are places, right,\n\n161\n00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:59,281\nthat don't have high speed connectivity,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n162\n00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:01,830\n>> [LAUGH] That's crazy.\n\n163\n00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,070\n>> I know, we've got a cohost here that\nlives in an area where unfortunately,\n\n164\n00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,670\ncannot get high speed internet access.\n\n165\n00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,130\n>> It's just like, wait, what?\n\n166\n00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,290\n>> I know.\n>> Like what is this?\n\n167\n00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,130\nWhere do you live?\n\n168\n00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,940\nIs like a cave or something.\n\n169\n00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,585\n>> Absolutely.\n\n170\n00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:21,230\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> It was something like, let's say,\n\n171\n00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:26,170\nif like some kind of disaster situation,\nyou lose power and\n\n172\n00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,735\nyou're not able to use a modem or\na router or something.\n\n173\n00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:29,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But\n\n174\n00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,790\nthe phone jack will still\nhave a phone connection.\n\n175\n00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,529\nSo if it was a critical situation,\nwhere you had to reach out,\n\n176\n00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:39,000\nyou could always take that phone line and\nplug it in, which always works.\n\n177\n00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,650\nLaptop, you can just dial in out of\nyour area when you know, power and\n\n178\n00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,170\nthings go down.\n\n179\n00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,080\n>> Absolutely, yeah yeah.\n\n180\n00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,470\n>> Any fail-over of\n>> Yeah, Don,\n\n181\n00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,600\nyou guys have all seen Don\nin some other episodes.\n\n182\n00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,400\nI think, he had one story where he talked\nabout the insurance company where their\n\n183\n00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,680\nlaptops that they had for their\ninsurance agents all had modems in them,\n\n184\n00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,720\nbecause they would have to go out\nafter a hurricane here in Florida and\n\n185\n00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,750\nthey'd have to visit these\nplaces that had been damaged and\n\n186\n00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,020\nsend in claim information or\nverify policies and things like that.\n\n187\n00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,040\nAnd high-speed internet access believe\nit or not, is not on the critical list.\n\n188\n00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,750\nWhen the emergency services are coming\nback in and they're restoring things like\n\n189\n00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,740\npower, high-speed internet access\nis not on their priority list.\n\n190\n00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,790\nI don't know why.\n\n191\n00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,980\nBut phones are, right?\n\n192\n00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,710\nSo power and\nphones are gonna be bought up first.\n\n193\n00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,200\nAnd now that my agent has a dial up or\n\n194\n00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,760\na modem in his laptop,\nhe can now connect back to the office\n\n195\n00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,580\neven before they reestablish my cable\nconnection and things like that.\n\n196\n00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,540\nSo still used.\n\n197\n00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,280\nStill there, and you know, we need to\nmake sure we mention that as well.\n\n198\n00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,885\n>> So\nthen back in the days of leased lines.\n\n199\n00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,040\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> They were kinda slow, by today's WiFi,\n\n200\n00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,682\nthey were pretty slow.\n\n201\n00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:55,780\nYou know, as the internet is much,\nmuch faster.\n\n202\n00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,690\nAnd super expensive.\n\n203\n00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,170\nAnd so getting away from those\nlease lines kind of thing,\n\n204\n00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,797\nthen you can leverage your internet,\nright?\n\n205\n00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,751\nWhich is pretty fast, right?\n\n206\n00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:10,020\nI mean, fast, whatever fast is.\n\n207\n00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,300\nAnd it's cheap, or\ncheaper compared to that.\n\n208\n00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,630\nSo it only makes sense to\nleverage that public network,\n\n209\n00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,640\nyou send all your crap through.\n\n210\n00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,090\n>> Exactly.\n\n211\n00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,130\n>> You know, more done cheaper.\n\n212\n00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,800\n>> Yep.\n>> Right.\n\n213\n00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,810\nFaster, cheaper, better.\n\n214\n00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,960\n>> Faster, cheaper, better.\n\n215\n00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,215\n>> We can rebuild.\n\n216\n00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:30,016\n[SOUND]\n>> What is that from?\n\n217\n00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,990\n>> That was before your day.\n\n218\n00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,070\nSix million dollar man?\n\n219\n00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,720\nRight, right.\n\n220\n00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,410\nYeah, come on.\n\n221\n00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,930\nYou guys out there got that reference,\nright?\n\n222\n00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,590\n>> I never saw it.\n\n223\n00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,100\n>> So yeah, we've got our remote access.\n\n224\n00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,130\nSays we got our VPNs.\n\n225\n00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,660\nNate already mentioned,\nwe have what we call a remote access VPN.\n\n226\n00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,340\nWhere we've got a single person that's at\nhome or at the hotel, or at Starbucks, or\n\n227\n00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,720\nwhatever and\nthey wanna access the corporate network.\n\n228\n00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,720\nAnd then we've got site to site VPNs,\nwhere we set them up between\n\n229\n00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,025\nmaybe two offices, a branch office and\na corporate office.\n\n230\n00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,490\n>> Where and we do that,\n\n231\n00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,430\nbecause if I've got 30 users out there at\nthe branch office, I don't need all 30 of\n\n232\n00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,790\nthem making individual tunnels back\nto the corporate office, right?\n\n233\n00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,490\nI set up one tunnel\nbetween the two offices.\n\n234\n00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,400\nAnd then, all the traffic just\ngoes through that tunnel.\n\n235\n00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,120\nAnd typically, the data is not originating\nat the end points of the tunnel.\n\n236\n00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,410\nThe tunnel is just set up between two\nrouters or to your firewall devices,\n\n237\n00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,960\nand then your LAN traffic just\ngoes through that tunnel.\n\n238\n00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,230\nSo you don't set up the VPN on\na client in a situation like that.\n\n239\n00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,650\nJust do it on the routers.\n\n240\n00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,400\n>> Yep.\n\n241\n00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,710\nAll right, sweet!\n\n242\n00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,120\nSo, all right, so\nnow we know what VPNs are and\n\n243\n00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,700\nkind of how we can use them-\n>> And wherever you'd wanna use them.\n\n244\n00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,000\n>> And what makes them,\nyou know, why they're so cool.\n\n245\n00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,530\nOh, and\nI'll just gonna throw it out there.\n\n246\n00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,750\n>> Yeah, throw it out there.\n\n247\n00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,557\n>> So I did some traveling this summer and\nI [LAUGH].\n\n248\n00:11:55,557 --> 00:12:01,130\nYou know, there's a public internet\nwhere I went or public hotspots, right?\n\n249\n00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,913\nAnd you know,\nI was in a foreign country and\n\n250\n00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:07,480\nI was a little nervous to use\nthese hotspots out there.\n\n251\n00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,630\nThey're just wide open.\n\n252\n00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,755\nYou can just go from spot to spot to spot.\n\n253\n00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:13,330\n>> [LAUGH] Did you do all your\nonline banking while you were there?\n\n254\n00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,120\nPay all your bills.\n\n255\n00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,760\n>> Well, I, I did some, like,\noh my gosh, how much money do I have?\n\n256\n00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,820\nCan I get home?\n\n257\n00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,600\nYes!\n\n258\n00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,805\nOkay, I can all right.\n\n259\n00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:24,080\n>> [LAUGH] I'm glad you made it back\n>> Thanks man.\n\n260\n00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,650\nSo on my smartphone, I have a VPN client.\n\n261\n00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,620\nAnd at my house, I set up a VPN server.\n\n262\n00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,100\nSo then while I was out and\naway and it wasn't, you know,\n\n263\n00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,518\nany business work related but I,\nyou know, I would connect to it.\n\n264\n00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:41,140\nAnd so then all my traffic that\nI was browsing on my smartphone\n\n265\n00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,090\nwas then encrypted and\nthen sent to my house, right?\n\n266\n00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,210\nAnd then from there it went out\nto the rest of the internet.\n\n267\n00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,488\nAnd it, you know, a secure way where,\nat least, I felt secure using it.\n\n268\n00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:53,917\n>> Mm-hm, yeah absolutely\n>> But yeah, and so\n\n269\n00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:58,160\noutside of the business,\nit has you know, other uses.\n\n270\n00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,720\nAirports and hotels and that sort of-\n>> Yeah,\n\n271\n00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,390\nif you're lucky enough to have a VPN\nserver sitting at the house, like Mr.\n\n272\n00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,830\nNate here does, but although, I would tell\nyou, it's much more common now, right?\n\n273\n00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,860\nEven the low end Linksys or delink little\n\n274\n00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,200\nbroadband routers that you can buy for\nyour house typically support VPN.\n\n275\n00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,430\nIf not VPN,\nsome of them support just VPN [INAUDIBLE].\n\n276\n00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,990\nOr I'd have to have a VPN server still.\n\n277\n00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,405\nBut a lot of them work\nas VPN endpoints now.\n\n278\n00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you can do just as Nate said,\n\n279\n00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,050\nwhere I can make a VPN back to my house\nand feel like a big corporate network or\n\n280\n00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,970\nsomething, you know?\n\n281\n00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,879\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nLike, don't talk to me, I'm so busy,\n\n282\n00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,720\nyou know what I mean?\n\n283\n00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720\nYeah.\n>> But cool, right?\n\n284\n00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,530\nBecause you're out in this\nforeign country where who knows\n\n285\n00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,720\nhow they've got their network setup.\n\n286\n00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,510\nThey're wide open.\n\n287\n00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,860\nYou don't have to put\nany kind of password in.\n\n288\n00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,860\nYou know, there's no type of\nencryption going on there.\n\n289\n00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,340\nSo anybody with a utility could\nhave seen what you were sending.\n\n290\n00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,322\nInstead, you made a VPN tunnel.\n\n291\n00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:56,600\nAnd now, it's all safe and\nsound inside that little tunnel there.\n\n292\n00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,220\n>> Now, what would have been really cool\nis, if I was able to have my VPN on and\n\n293\n00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,710\nroam between the different hotspots and\nhave it always stay connected.\n\n294\n00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,776\n>> I wish that there was\nsomething that would allow that.\n\n295\n00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:14,070\n[LAUGH] Of course,\nwe'll get into that a little bit later.\n\n296\n00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,050\n>> That was a real good segue\njust a little bit early, maybe?\n\n297\n00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,080\n>> Yeah, a little early.\n\n298\n00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,730\n>> Because we probably should talk about\nthe protocols that we have available.\n\n299\n00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,570\nSo now we know what a VPN is.\n\n300\n00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,440\nIt's a Virtual Private Network that we're\nestablishing either between two offices or\n\n301\n00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,270\nbetween a remote user and an office.\n\n302\n00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,950\nSo what are my choices there?\n\n303\n00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,540\nWhat do we get to pick from,\nwhen we're setting up this tunnel?\n\n304\n00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,210\n>> Keep, cheap, seep,\neat, leap and MS Chat.\n\n305\n00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,018\n>> Well and before we get into the, and\n\n306\n00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,555\nyou're going into\nthe authentication methods.\n\n307\n00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:45,885\nBut, I mislead you there.\n\n308\n00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,433\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's talk about the tunneling\n\n309\n00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,170\nprotocols first.\n\n310\n00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,980\nWhat are we using to tunnel or\ncreate that tunnel?\n\n311\n00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,560\nWhat are we encapsulating\nthose packets with?\n\n312\n00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,430\nAnd that's my tunneling protocol.\n\n313\n00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,910\nThere we've got, what?\n\n314\n00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,210\nIf you guys are ready,\nget your pencils out.\n\n315\n00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,910\nJust acronym after acronym,

many jokes\nI can make about that, right?\n\n325\n00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,730\nAnd L2TP and yeah.\n\n326\n00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Kind of makes me feel like Beavis and\n\n327\n00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,265\nButthead up here.\n\n328\n00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:37,842\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's funny.\n\n329\n00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:40,020\n>> Yeah.\nBut PPTP is my Point to\n\n330\n00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,500\nPoint Tunneling Protocol.\n\n331\n00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,290\nIt's what you need to know about PPTP.\n\n332\n00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,390\nI mean,\nwe don't have to go too far into it.\n\n333\n00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,101\nBut Point to Point Telling Protocol.\n\n334\n00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:54,805\nIt goes over ports 1723 and\nit has built in encryption capabilities.\n\n335\n00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:59,157\nThat's one of the biggest things we need\nto know about that is If I'm using PPTP to\n\n336\n00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,698\nestablish that VPN tunnel.\n\n337\n00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,882\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Then I have built into that\n\n338\n00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:07,550\nprotocol the ability to\nencrypt the packets.\n\n339\n00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,000\nIt actually takes advantage of PPPs,\nwhich is the point to point protocol.\n\n340\n00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,410\nMPPE, Microsoft point to point encryption.\n\n341\n00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,650\nSo, to get real crazy on you guys,\n\n342\n00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,708\nPPTP uses PPP's built in\nMPPE to encrypt the traffic.\n\n343\n00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,427\n>> Um-hm.\n\n344\n00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,970\n[LAUGH]\n>> I always just like saying that and\n\n345\n00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,840\nwatch people go, huh?\n\n346\n00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,200\nBut you guys know what I'm saying, right?\n\n347\n00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,780\n>> I do.\n\n348\n00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,140\nI just did.\n\n349\n00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,950\n>> Yeah.\nSo again, point to point\n\n350\n00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,720\ntunneling protocol, 1723, and it uses\nMicrosoft point to point encryption,\n\n351\n00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,910\nwhich is part of the PPP\nprotocol to encrypt that data.\n\n352\n00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,200\nIt's been around for awhile, PPTP is\none of the older tunneling protocols.\n\n353\n00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,065\n>> Now PPTP.\n\n354\n00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:53,210\n[LAUGH]\nThat has been broken,\n\n355\n00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,180\nor cracked, or what not.\n\n356\n00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,900\n>> Yeah.\n\n357\n00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,195\n>> So I guess if you have\nsuper sensitive information.\n\n358\n00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:05,140\nYou know, whatever goes through the PPTP,\nshould be considered unencrypted.\n\n359\n00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,090\nSo you wouldn't want to send.\n\n360\n00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:07,800\n>> Really.\nYeah.\n\n361\n00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,120\n>> Yeah it's yeah.\n\n362\n00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,470\n>> You hackers, I tell you what.\n\n363\n00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,150\nThey're always ruining a good thing,\nyou know.\n\n364\n00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,880\n>> But it.\n>> Still a very common protocol that\n\n365\n00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,190\nwe see used out there.\n\n366\n00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,764\nIt used to be the default protocol,\nbut as Nate points out,\n\n367\n00:17:19,764 --> 00:17:21,860\nit's got some vulnerabilities now.\n\n368\n00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,980\nIt's been around for so long.\n\n369\n00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,740\nIt was designed back when computers\ndidn't have the processing power\n\n370\n00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,650\nto use these larger algorithms and stuff.\n\n371\n00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,320\nSo there's definitely\nbeen some improvements.\n\n372\n00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,430\nIt was, up until I think XP,\nit was the default protocol.\n\n373\n00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,170\nWhen you set up one,\nit would use first if you didn't specify.\n\n374\n00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,640\nSo yeah, it is a little bit weaker.\n\n375\n00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,580\n>> But it still is encrypted, though.\n\n376\n00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,170\n>> Yup.\nIt is encrypted.\n\n377\n00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,100\nJust weak encryption.\n\n378\n00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,018\nSo if somebody really wants to\nget in there they could probably\n\n379\n00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:49,543\nbreak your encryption on that.\n\n380\n00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:50,819\nThen we've got.\n\n381\n00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,680\n>> L2TP.\n\n382\n00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,180\n>> Which is.\n\n383\n00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,890\n>> IPsec.\n\n384\n00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,230\nThe layer two tunneling protocol.\n\n385\n00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,810\n>> Layer two tunneling protocol.\n\n386\n00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,590\n>> Yep, and\nthat's the tunneling protocol, and\n\n387\n00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,230\nthen the IPsec that goes with\nit is the encryption part.\n\n388\n00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,950\nThey're generally used together.\n\n389\n00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,800\nAlthough, they don't have to,\nbut generally they're, together.\n\n390\n00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,020\n>> Yeah.\nI like to say the difference so,\n\n391\n00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,640\nwith L2TP layer two tunneling protocol\nnow we're talking about port 1701.\n\n392\n00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,625\nSo 1701 for L2TP and it does not have\nbuilt-in encryption capabilities.\n\n393\n00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:26,155\n>> L2TP does not, which is kinda odd for\na tunneling protocol right?\n\n394\n00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:28,467\nIt's like wait,\nI need to encrypt this data.\n\n395\n00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:35,325\nAnd so, 99% of the time you're\ngonna see it written L2TP/IPsec.\n\n396\n00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:40,100\nWe've gotta bring something along\nwith L2TP to encrypt the traffic.\n\n397\n00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,190\nAnd it's almost always internet\nprotocol security or IPsec.\n\n398\n00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,071\nThey're not part of each other,\nbut L2TP, again,\n\n399\n00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,480\nyou almost always use them together.\n\n400\n00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,450\nBecause I've got to protect that data.\n\n401\n00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,741\nAnd it goes across port 17,\nI want to say 1701 for L2TP.\n\n402\n00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:56,875\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n403\n00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:01,130\n>> And it's another one that's commonly\n\n404\n00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,540\nused with IPsec when we start talking\nabout, I don't know if we've,\n\n405\n00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,470\nI can't remember the episode,\nwhich episode we covered IPSec with.\n\n406\n00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,690\n>> Oh, that's right, I remember that.\n>> But\n\n407\n00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,580\ndifferent authentication methods\nthat you can use along with IPSec,\n\n408\n00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,860\ncertificates, preshared keys,\nand things like that.\n\n409\n00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,590\nSo sometimes, depending on how,\nif you wanna use certificates,\n\n410\n00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,875\nnow all of a sudden we're talking\nabout another infrastructure,\n\n411\n00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,160\nsome kind of key infrastructure.\n\n412\n00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,180\nYou guys remember that episode?\n\n413\n00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,320\nSo, a little more complex to set up,\nalso, I think, a little more secure.\n\n414\n00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,470\nAnd then our third one is SSTP.\n\n415\n00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,964\nSSTP is cool, it's new to,\nwhen did it come out,\n\n416\n00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:43,220\nWindows 7 in Server 2008,\nI believe, is when SSTP.\n\n417\n00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,330\nSSTP is secure socket telling protocol.\n\n418\n00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,540\nPop quiz for you guys at home,\n\n419\n00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,270\nif I say secure sockets, what port number\ndo you think that one's going over?\n\n420\n00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,180\nLight up my chatroom.\n\n421\n00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,440\nAww.\n\n422\n00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,100\n>> There it is you see?\n\n423\n00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,030\nThat thing is just blowing up.\n\n424\n00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,980\n>> All right, yeah,\nSSTP uses secure socket layer.\n\n425\n00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,810\nWell, what else uses secure sockets\nthat you guys use every day?\n\n426\n00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,960\n>> My Internet browser.\n\n427\n00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,040\n>> Yeah, https.\n\n428\n00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,750\nAlso used to secure sockets.\n\n429\n00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,670\nWhich is what port?\n\n430\n00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,290\n>> 442.\n\n431\n00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,810\n443, sorry.\n\n432\n00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,390\n>> He was trying to trick me there.\n\n433\n00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,300\n>> I was just seeing\nif you were listening.\n\n434\n00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:28,020\n>> So SSTP, which uses SSL, or\nsecure sockets, also goes over port 443.\n\n435\n00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:33,140\nBig advantage there is because\nif there's any firewalls\n\n436\n00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,190\nbetween me and that remote access\nserver that I'm trying to connect to,\n\n437\n00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,180\nthat are not in my control, right.\n\n438\n00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,600\nThey might not allow 1701 or 1723.\n\n439\n00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,010\nThose aren't real common ports and I might\nhave to call somebody up and say hey, can\n\n440\n00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,490\nyou open up this port or I might not have\nany control over that firewall whatsoever.\n\n441\n00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,552\nMost firewalls are going\nto be set up to allow 443,\n\n442\n00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:59,122\nbecause it's a very common protocol used,\nright, for HTTPS.\n\n443\n00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:03,420\nSo, now my VPN is going\nacross that same port,\n\n444\n00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,460\nI don't have as many firewall\nissues to worry about.\n\n445\n00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,280\nThat's one of the advantages of SSTP.\n\n446\n00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,947\nWhat's another one?\n\n447\n00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:12,170\nI know you're gonna throw\nthat one out there.\n\n448\n00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,960\n>> Which?\n\n449\n00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,750\n>> Oh, I don't know.\n\n450\n00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,430\nAre there anymore?\n\n451\n00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,030\nNo.\nIt does support,\n\n452\n00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,610\nwell now I guess that's\nreally probably enough.\n\n453\n00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,240\nIf we know that SSTP uses port 443,\nand then it does have built-in\n\n454\n00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,140\nencryption capabilities, it's using\nthe SSL or the Secure Socket Layer.\n\n455\n00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,820\nAnd it is now the default,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n456\n00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,530\nI should probably double check on that.\n\n457\n00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,450\nBut when you set up a VPN on a client\nside, a lot of times they'll leave it\n\n458\n00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:49,190\nas automatic and\nit'll cycle through all the protocols, and\n\n459\n00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,800\npick whichever one the other\nend is set up to accept.\n\n460\n00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,759\nWhatever the strongest one\nthe other end is set up to accept.\n\n461\n00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,388\nPPTP used to be the preferred,\nSSTP I believe is now, but I could,\n\n462\n00:21:59,388 --> 00:22:01,551\nI should double check on that.\n\n463\n00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:06,443\nCuz actually IKEv2 is probably\nmore preferred at this point,\n\n464\n00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:09,784\nwhich is our next one\nwe need to talk about.\n\n465\n00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:16,460\nIKEv2, Internet Key Exchange Version 2 is\nanother tunneling protocol we can use.\n\n466\n00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,929\nPort number-\n>> 500.\n\n467\n00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:20,670\n>> UDP 500.\n\n468\n00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,095\nUDP 500.\n\n469\n00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:24,210\nCha-ching.\n\n470\n00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,250\nAnd this guy's is pretty cool, right?\n\n471\n00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,160\nIt has a couple of technologies\nthat we don't have in the others.\n\n472\n00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,510\nWhich is Nate's segway there earlier,\nright.\n\n473\n00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:41,910\nYou're at a, say you're gonna roam\nbetween one hot spot and another.\n\n474\n00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,292\nOr, you're on a train.\n\n475\n00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:46,390\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n476\n00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,960\nYep.\n\n477\n00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,780\n>> So if you go out to TechNet,\n\n478\n00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,840\nsome of the examples that they use for\ntheir stuff are a little silly.\n\n479\n00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,650\nBut their example is like, if you're on\na train and you've got a VPN connection\n\n480\n00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,690\nestablished to your work network,\nand you go through a tunnel.\n\n481\n00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,150\nWell you temporarily lose\nyour connectivity, right?\n\n482\n00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,230\nAs soon as you pop out the other\nside of the tunnel, ba-bing,\n\n483\n00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,280\nyour VPN connection reconnects,\nwithout you having to.\n\n484\n00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,300\nWith the other tunneling protocols,\nwith L2TP, PPTP,\n\n485\n00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,270\nif I drop my connection, I'm gonna have\nto manually reestablish the connection.\n\n486\n00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,360\nI'm gonna have to go and double-click\non it again, put my user name and\n\n487\n00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,680\npassword in again.\n\n488\n00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,670\nAnd I'm not connecting back to the same\nsession, so I could have lost work,\n\n489\n00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,650\nI could have lost data.\n\n490\n00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,370\nWhereas with that VPN reconnect\nwith IKEv2, it's seamless.\n\n491\n00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,410\nIt basically tricks the other end\ninto thinking you're still connected.\n\n492\n00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,090\nAnd so you come out the other\nside of the tunnel and\n\n493\n00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,860\nyou reconnect back to that same session.\n\n494\n00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,120\nPretty sweet.\n\n495\n00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,210\n>> Yeah.\nSuper sweet.\n\n496\n00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,159\nAnd, you know, and\nwhat I think is really cool is yeah,\n\n497\n00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,218\nyou can basically roam between access\npoints if you are in a busy place.\n\n498\n00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:57,561\nYou've got a walkway, and\nthere's shops and all sorts of things.\n\n499\n00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,471\nAnd everybody has hotspots everywhere.\n\n500\n00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,524\nThen you can just kinda ding,\nding, ding, ding, ding, ding.\n\n501\n00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:02,153\nYou know down there and.\n\n502\n00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:03,028\n>> Yup.\nAbsolutely.\n\n503\n00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:05,623\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Even in a larger corporate environment\n\n504\n00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:09,405\nwhere I've got multiple access points to\nmake sure I've got a good coverage over my\n\n505\n00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,280\nentire building.\n\n506\n00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,390\nAs I roam between access points I'm\ndropping one connection, right?\n\n507\n00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,680\nAnd reconnecting to this\nother access point.\n\n508\n00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,540\nThat VPN connection would remain.\n\n509\n00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,270\nIf we're using that IP too.\n\n510\n00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,760\nSo, very slick stuff that does\nrequire a couple of things,all right?\n\n511\n00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,840\n>> You need those certificates, right?\n\n512\n00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,800\nWe need those guys.\n\n513\n00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,520\nThe PKI.\n\n514\n00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,220\nAnd of course that requires it's own\nbig major setup stuff for it to work\n\n515\n00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,590\n>> Yeah, great episode, I think,\n\n516\n00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,160\nmake sure you guys check that one out.\n\n517\n00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,560\n>> Oh yeah, that was a great one.\n\n518\n00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,202\n>> I love certificate services.\n\n519\n00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:45,060\nJust a good thing.\n\n520\n00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,850\nI don't know, sometimes I think\nI have too many favorites.\n\n521\n00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,440\nI can't decide between, certificate\nservices, active directory, DNS,\n\n522\n00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,130\nhas got to be on my top ten.\n\n523\n00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,656\n>> DNS.\n>> Good stuff.\n\n524\n00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:58,550\nIt makes everything work.\n\n525\n00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,460\nWithout it, anyway,\nthat's a whole other episode.\n\n526\n00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,300\nOr two or three, so.\n\n527\n00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,110\nAll right, so\nwe're talked about what a VPN is, right?\n\n528\n00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,300\nDefined our VPNs,\nwe talked about the different\n\n529\n00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,918\nprotocols that we can use to\nestablish that VPN connection.\n\n530\n00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:20,510\nL2TP, PPTP, SSTP, IKEv2.\n\n531\n00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:25,860\nWe've talked about the difference\nbetween say a site to site VPN and\n\n532\n00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,350\na remote access VPN.\n\n533\n00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,050\nSo that is going to bring us into.\n\n534\n00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,240\nWhat do we want to do next, with VPN's?\n\n535\n00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,200\n>> Yeah, so-\n>> Set one up, or show them how to create\n\n536\n00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,440\none or do we need to-\n>> Yeah, I think so,\n\n537\n00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,760\nbecause we do have right\nafter on our little note\n\n538\n00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,350\nsheet to go into remote desktop, which\nwe've already covered remote assistance.\n\n539\n00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,170\nMaybe we'll do a Remote- Assistance at the\nend, since we're kinda on this VPN roll.\n\n540\n00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,900\n>> Let's stick with VPN,\nthat's what I think.\n\n541\n00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,040\nSometimes the objectives,\nas you guys are studying,\n\n542\n00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,240\nmight not go in the best order that\nyou should actually be studying in.\n\n543\n00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,950\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n544\n00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,236\nYou don't have to go 6.1, 6.2, 6.3.\n\n545\n00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,690\nSo, yeah, I say let's stick with VPNs.\n\n546\n00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,300\nFinish that.\n\n547\n00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,490\nThen we can move on\ninto remote assistance.\n\n548\n00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,560\nAnd that'll be a smoother segway for\nyou guys out there.\n\n549\n00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,840\nSo what else?\n\n550\n00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,950\nWe talked about configuring.\n\n551\n00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,270\nWhat did you want to do next?\n\n552\n00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,660\n>> Well yeah I think-\n>> Show them?\n\n553\n00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,800\nYeah get in there and.\n\n554\n00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,480\n>> Let's do it.\n\n555\n00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,710\n>> And so when up now.\n\n556\n00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,160\n>> We have a VPN server.\n\n557\n00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,170\n>> Yes I do, I we can connect to mine.\n\n558\n00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:35,690\nI know.\n\n559\n00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,180\n>> I'll tell you what.\n\n560\n00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,828\n>> Actually just made it last night.\n\n561\n00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:41,785\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n562\n00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:46,710\n>> But yeah, we've got a few minutes\nleft and I have to do something but\n\n563\n00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,680\nnot enough to blaze through\nthat wizard and setup.\n\n564\n00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,961\n>> Like a little dance?\n\n565\n00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:54,310\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n566\n00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,200\n>> I don't want to dance.\n\n567\n00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,280\n>> All right.\n\n568\n00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,920\n>> I'm tethered.\n\n569\n00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,700\n>> Yes, that is true, that would\nkind of limit your dancing skills.\n\n570\n00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,270\nThat is my profile,\nI am supposedly a master line dancer.\n\n571\n00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:06,830\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, that's right.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n572\n00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,676\n>> Teach you a few moves.\n\n573\n00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:15,702\n>> Now that's\n\n574\n00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:19,555\nall I can think about.\n\n575\n00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,255\n[LAUGH]\n>> Me line dancing?\n\n576\n00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:25,090\n[LAUGH] but\nit would not be a pretty sight.\n\n577\n00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,795\nAnd it would take lots of alcohol.\n\n578\n00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:30,390\n[LAUGH].\n>> Oh my gosh.\n\n579\n00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,242\nI would need a lot to\nbe able to watch that.\n\n580\n00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:34,209\n>> Can you imagine [LAUGH]?\n\n581\n00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:37,760\n>> Alright let's hang it up\n>> Okay.\n\n582\n00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,120\n>> For right now, yeah.\n\n583\n00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> We'll take a short little break.\n\n584\n00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,180\n>> Okay.\n\n585\n00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,660\n>> And then when we get back,\nwe will make one of these VPN connections.\n\n586\n00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,320\n>> Yeah,\nwe can see all the different options and\n\n587\n00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,400\nwhere we can pick the different protocols\nand the authentication methods and that's\n\n588\n00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,550\nprobably where we should go next is the\ndifferent methods we have available, so.\n\n589\n00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,210\n>> Oh, that's right.\nYep.\n\n590\n00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:04,455\n>> Stay tuned and\nwe will catch you on the flip side.\n\n591\n00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:08,581\n[SOUND] You ready?\n\n592\n00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:10,764\n>> All right, and welcome back.\n\n593\n00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:12,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n594\n00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,530\nSo where we left off we were\ntalking all about cool VPN stuff.\n\n595\n00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:24,090\nAnd so now I think the next step is going\nto be to set it up and show it connecting.\n\n596\n00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,630\n>> Let's do it, sounds like a plan to me.\n\n597\n00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,060\n>> All right, just right now,\njust jump into it?\n\n598\n00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,040\n>> Yeah, that's what they've\nbeen dying to see, right?\n\n599\n00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,330\nThey've been on this break, and\nthen they're like, \"Come on back so\n\n600\n00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,830\nwe can see this cool VPN in action.\n\n601\n00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,080\nHow do we set one of these things up?\" So,\nNate's gonna show us all about it.\n\n602\n00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,180\n>> All right.\n\n603\n00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:48,340\nSo what we're gonna do is we'll just\nrun through the little VPN wizard.\n\n604\n00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,050\nI'll run through it Mike.\n\n605\n00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,120\nI guess you're gonna talk.\n\n606\n00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,180\n>> I can narrate.\n\n607\n00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,760\n>> Narrate.\n\n608\n00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,520\n>> I can.\n\n609\n00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,840\n>> And we'll just fire it up and connect.\n\n610\n00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,550\n>> Now are you gonna use, cuz you're\ngonna go through the wizard, right.\n\n611\n00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,140\nYou're gonna go through\nyour network connections.\n\n612\n00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,780\nAnd you're gonna set up a VPN connection.\n\n613\n00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,200\nWe haven't really talked about the\nconnection manager administration kit yet.\n\n614\n00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,420\nSo we can maybe throw that up at\nthe end or something like that.\n\n615\n00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,190\nLet's walk through creating one.\n\n616\n00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,750\nSo if you were an end user or if you\nwere a desktop support technician and\n\n617\n00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,960\nyou needed to set up this laptop for\nyour salesperson or\n\n618\n00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,910\nfrom your remote worker to\nset up a VPN connection.\n\n619\n00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,990\nWe could go to the machine and we're\ngonna watch Nate ,show us how to do it.\n\n620\n00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:32,000\nHe's gonna start by getting\nout his remote control.\n\n621\n00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,060\nNo, just kidding.\n\n622\n00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,030\nHe's gonna open up his network\nconnections, and there's his beautiful\n\n623\n00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,880\nbackground on this little virtual machine\nthat he has running, ooh it's running 8.1.\n\n624\n00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,700\n>> Yeah.\nI know, [INAUDIBLE] for these new ones.\n\n625\n00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,510\n>> So he actually has 8.1 on those VMs.\n\n626\n00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,640\nSo there you can see he's opened up\nhis network and sharing center and\n\n627\n00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,750\nthere's an easy little link to click on.\n\n628\n00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,545\nSet up a connection for a network.\n\n629\n00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:54,100\n>> Yup.\n\n630\n00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,090\n>> And\nthen we're gonna connect to our workplace.\n\n631\n00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,590\n>> Yup.\n\n632\n00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,969\n>> If you click that\nmouse a little harder.\n\n633\n00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:06,310\n[LAUGH] And then we're gonna,\nhere what you would do is if you were at\n\n634\n00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,080\nthe hotel you've already\ngot an internet connection.\n\n635\n00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,670\nRight?\nYou've connected to the ISP for\n\n636\n00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:15,420\nthe hotel or at Starbucks, they've got\ntheir hotspot, or at home you've got\n\n637\n00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,570\nyour internet connection,\nyou're always on broadband connection.\n\n638\n00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,790\nSo we're just gonna say look,\nI've already got an internet,\n\n639\n00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,800\nI'm gonna use my internet connections to\nset up this VPN at my own work place.\n\n640\n00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,260\nOtherwise if we had a modem we would\nbe clicking the option dial directly.\n\n641\n00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,980\nAnd then I would go through a slightly\ndifferent wizard where I'd have to punch\n\n642\n00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,440\nin enough phone numbers for that server.\n\n643\n00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,210\nAnd that server back at work would\nhave to have a bank of modems in it\n\n644\n00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,390\nto receive those inbound phone calls.\n\n645\n00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,850\nSo we'll do use my Internet connection,\nVPN.\n\n646\n00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:46,350\nAnd then really all you need\nto provide is the name and or\n\n647\n00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,170\nthe IP address of that VPN server.\n\n648\n00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:53,730\nI will say that typically\nwe're gonna use IP addresses,\n\n649\n00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,670\nbecause we can eliminate DNS as being\na source of trouble in the future.\n\n650\n00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,330\nCan they resolve the name\nof your VPN server\n\n651\n00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:08,010\nwhen they're connected to that hotel's\nISP or when they're in Timbuktu.\n\n652\n00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,330\nIs that publicly resolvable?\n\n653\n00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,370\nAnd if it is,\nthey can use the name there, but\n\n654\n00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,150\nagain, if I just use the IP address, I\ndon't even have to worry about DNS issues.\n\n655\n00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,780\nWe can just eliminate that altogether.\n\n656\n00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,613\nSo type in the name or\n\n657\n00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:23,066\nthe IP address of the VPN server\nthat you want to connect to.\n\n658\n00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:31,257\nITProTV dash Nate, is a geek.\n\n659\n00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:33,610\nI like it.\n\n660\n00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,310\nAnd for the destination name\nyou can put whatever you want.\n\n661\n00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,960\nHere it doesn't do anything\nfunctionally other than,\n\n662\n00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,120\nif you have multiple VPN connection\nobjects in your network connections\n\n663\n00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,510\nwindow, one to connect to this office,\none to connect to this other office,\n\n664\n00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,950\nor something like that, the name just\nhelps you differentiate between them.\n\n665\n00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,360\nSo functionally it doesn't do anything.\n\n666\n00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,697\nI can call it ASDF,\nwhich is my favorite [INAUDIBLE] things.\n\n667\n00:31:53,697 --> 00:31:54,920\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,yeah.\n\n668\n00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,317\n>> The old home row keys for\nyour left hand there.\n\n669\n00:31:57,317 --> 00:32:01,400\n[COUGH] So he's typed in the name,\nor the IP address.\n\n670\n00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,879\nHe actually typed in the name of the VPN\nserver that he wants to connect to.\n\n671\n00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:07,475\nDown below, if you were gonna use\na smart card for authentication.\n\n672\n00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:11,128\nWe haven't really talked about our\ndifferent authentication methods yet.\n\n673\n00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:12,985\nWe could check that check mark there.\n\n674\n00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:14,495\nRemember my credentials.\n\n675\n00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:15,702\nHorrible, horrible idea.\n\n676\n00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:17,931\nNate really loves that idea.\n\n677\n00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:22,596\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We talk about this more in our security\n\n678\n00:32:22,596 --> 00:32:23,921\nplus episodes I think.\n\n679\n00:32:23,921 --> 00:32:28,730\nBut the problem I have with that being I\nlike the security side of things is that\n\n680\n00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,655\nif somebody gets your laptop.\n\n681\n00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:33,549\nYou leave yourself logged in and\nyou're at Starbucks and\n\n682\n00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:35,773\nsomebody walks off with your laptop,\n\n683\n00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:41,060\nthey could then double-click on your VPN\nconnection and connect to work as you.\n\n684\n00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,910\nSo I would much rather my users have\nto type in their username and password.\n\n685\n00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,230\nAnd here you could say remember\nmy credentials, but, like I said,\n\n686\n00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,370\nI would not.\n\n687\n00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,710\nThat's just a good security practice.\n\n688\n00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:57,260\n>> You know, Mike, it does bring up\nanother point is that a VPN connection.\n\n689\n00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,450\nRight?\nSo we're gonna go from this machine here\n\n690\n00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,940\nto the VPN server that's\nout there on the Internet.\n\n691\n00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,790\nAnd, now it's a two-way,\na two-way communication deal.\n\n692\n00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,460\nSo I'm connecting out to that VPN, and\n\n693\n00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,690\nlet's say if I had a malware or\nthings on my computer,\n\n694\n00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:24,270\nit can jump through that VPN and\ninfect the places that I'm connecting to.\n\n695\n00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:28,310\n>> Absolutely, if you had, we talked about\nthat in our security plus episode and\n\n696\n00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,670\nhow viruses work.\n\n697\n00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,680\nIf you've got an infected file on your\nmachine, and you have that open, or\n\n698\n00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,210\nit's loaded up in your memory, then\nyou connect to your VPN connection and\n\n699\n00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,797\nyou open up a file from\na file server back at work.\n\n700\n00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:42,640\nThat file is now infected and\nwhen you save and close that file,\n\n701\n00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,920\nit's sitting there on your\nfile server back at work.\n\n702\n00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,580\nAny of your co-workers that are back there\nopen that file up, they're now infected.\n\n703\n00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,760\nSo easy to transmit stuff across that\nVPN connection, for sure, for sure.\n\n704\n00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,590\n>> And yeah, so\n\n705\n00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,860\nbasically, it will be like we are actually\non that physical network, more or less.\n\n706\n00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,830\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n707\n00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,280\nAnd that really it's a very good point,\nyou know.\n\n708\n00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,900\nWhen we talk about VPNs we need to\ndifferentiate between remote control and\n\n709\n00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,624\nremote access.\n\n710\n00:34:09,624 --> 00:34:10,360\nRight?\n\n711\n00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,850\nIn our other episode we talked\nabout things like remote desktop.\n\n712\n00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,200\nAnd today we're gonna hit a little\nbit of remote assistance.\n\n713\n00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,820\nBut when we look at remote desktop, we're\ntalking about remote control protocol.\n\n714\n00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,230\nLots of them out there.\n\n715\n00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,360\nGoToMyPC, PCAnywhere,\nall those different things.\n\n716\n00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,170\nThose are remote control protocols.\n\n717\n00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,410\nYou're taking over a machine\nthat's already on the network.\n\n718\n00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:35,640\nSo I'm reaching out to my work place,\nmy computer that's in my office, I'm gonna\n\n719\n00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,180\ntake that machine over and I'm gonna bring\nits desktop back to me wherever I am.\n\n720\n00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,110\nThat's remote control.\n\n721\n00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,960\nI'm remotely controlling that machine\nthat's already on the network.\n\n722\n00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,870\n>> With remote desktop.\n\n723\n00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,260\n>> With remote desktop.\n\n724\n00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,470\n>> Okay.\n>> VPN's are remote access,\n\n725\n00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,900\nnot remote control.\n\n726\n00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,560\nSo it's more like I'm taking\nthe computer I'm sitting at and\n\n727\n00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,565\ntaking a really long ethernet cable.\n\n728\n00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:56,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n729\n00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,220\nplugging it into a switch back at work.\n\n730\n00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,310\nSo I'm not taking over a machine\nthat's already on the network,\n\n731\n00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,440\nI'm adding another\ncomputer to the network.\n\n732\n00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,050\nMake sense?\n\n733\n00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,960\nSo that's where, the difference again\nbetween remote access and remote control.\n\n734\n00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,240\nRemote access, you're taking over\na machine that's on the network.\n\n735\n00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,660\nI'm sorry, remote control, you're taking\nover machine that's on the network.\n\n736\n00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,560\nRemote access, you're adding\nanother machine to the network.\n\n737\n00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,430\nSo, exactly right.\n\n738\n00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,370\nIf you've got an infected machine,\nyou wouldn't want that person to walk into\n\n739\n00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,910\nyour workplace, and\nplug into your network.\n\n740\n00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,750\nRight?\n\n741\n00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,570\nSame thing here.\n\n742\n00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,930\nIf they're doing a VPN connection, they're\nplugging their machine into your network.\n\n743\n00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,400\n>> So\n>> With all that stuff being said,\n\n744\n00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,835\nI think this last option.\n\n745\n00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:37,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I am not going to check that and\n\n746\n00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,000\nit is allow other people\ndo this connection.\n\n747\n00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,180\nWell, no way, no way.\n\n748\n00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,840\n>> Well, well, well, yes.\n\n749\n00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,395\nI see your point there.\n\n750\n00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n751\n00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,031\nwhat we're doing here is,\nlet's say this is a shared laptop.\n\n752\n00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:50,170\nAll right?\n\n753\n00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,330\nSo it's not so much that, like,\n\n754\n00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,110\nlet other people from other machines\ngo across your connection as it is.\n\n755\n00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,150\nIf there's multiple users on that machine,\n\n756\n00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,410\ndo I have to set up this VPN\nconnection object on each profile?\n\n757\n00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,570\nLike if you log off, and\nI log on to your machine.\n\n758\n00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,220\nI'm not gonna see that\nVPN connection object.\n\n759\n00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,240\nI'm gonna have to make my own.\n\n760\n00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,890\nI'll have to put in all the settings and\nthings like that.\n\n761\n00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,610\nIf you check allow other\npeople to use this connection,\n\n762\n00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,860\nnow when I log on I would already see\nthat, and I could double click on it.\n\n763\n00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:22,940\nSo, that's really what that's for.\n\n764\n00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,954\nYeah, I would say let's not, I mean,\n\n765\n00:36:24,954 --> 00:36:28,630\nnormally, I don't know how many\nshared computers we have these days.\n\n766\n00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,215\nNot as many.\n\n767\n00:36:29,215 --> 00:36:31,500\nYeah, everyone's got their own machine.\n\n768\n00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,394\nRight?\n>> Yeah, this one's mine.\n\n769\n00:36:32,394 --> 00:36:34,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you can't use this one.\n\n770\n00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,590\n>> You can touch it.\n\n771\n00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,535\n>> No, Mike, stop.\n\n772\n00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:37,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n773\n00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,420\nNow the next step down\nthere it says create.\n\n774\n00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,530\nRight Mike?\n\n775\n00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,110\n>> Oh, sorry.\n>> So\n\n776\n00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,760\n>> I was gonna touch his machine for him.\n\n777\n00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,330\n>> That's it.\n\n778\n00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,700\nThat's all there is to this wizard.\n\n779\n00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,380\n>> That was it?\n>> Yep.\n\n780\n00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:48,940\nThat was it.\n\n781\n00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,490\nNo more old menus.\n\n782\n00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,160\n>> We click Create?\n>> We click Create.\n\n783\n00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,050\nIt will create the connection.\n\n784\n00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:53,550\n>> Yes it will.\n\n785\n00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,440\n>> And it is going with little green bar.\n\n786\n00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,050\n>> And hopefully\n>> Building it.\n\n787\n00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,150\n>> It'll build it.\n\n788\n00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,060\nYes, now when we say that's all you need,\n\n789\n00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,240\nwith this is just a default VP and\nconnection object.\n\n790\n00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,250\nThere are many more settings\nthat we can go in and configure.\n\n791\n00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,250\nAnd typically we do have to configure\nbecause the client has to be set up to\n\n792\n00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,520\nuse the same tunnel protocols,\nthe same authentication protocols, the,\n\n793\n00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,410\nall of that.\n\n794\n00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,350\nBecause if my client wants to use PPTP,\nbut my server is only set\n\n795\n00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:29,790\nup to allow L2TP connections [LAUGH],\nthen they're not gonna be able to connect.\n\n796\n00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,100\nRight?\nWhat we just did, if we go back in and\n\n797\n00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,070\nlook at it,\nit is gonna be set to automatic.\n\n798\n00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,540\nIt is gonna be all of\nthe defaults basically.\n\n799\n00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:43,005\nBut in the real world if they\nhave secured their VPN server.\n\n800\n00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:44,810\n>> Like a default to IKE,\nis that where you cycle in?\n\n801\n00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,565\n>> Yes.\nWith Windows 8 now that is the preferred,\n\n802\n00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,270\nbut it'll cycle through.\n\n803\n00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,270\nIn fact, if you right-click and\n\n804\n00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,270\npull up the properties of that you'll\nsee why it's gonna cycle through.\n\n805\n00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:00,580\nGo to your Security tab there and\nyou see type of VPN is set to automatic.\n\n806\n00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,350\nSo it's gonna try IKEV2 first because\nthat's it's preferred method.\n\n807\n00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,880\nBut if the server doesn't answer or\n\n808\n00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,400\nwon't accept an IKEV2 connection,\nthen it's gonna try PPTP.\n\n809\n00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,150\nAnd if that doesn't work it'll try L2TP.\n\n810\n00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,920\nAnd it'll keep going until it finds one\nthat the server accepts, hopefully.\n\n811\n00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,290\nSo yeah, that's just all,\n\n812\n00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,650\nand that's why I say that wizard\nwas pretty straightforward.\n\n813\n00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:26,250\nBut usually in the real world we gotta\ngo back in once we've created it and\n\n814\n00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,070\nadjust some of these settings.\n\n815\n00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,720\nAnd that's just to harden it,\nmake it a little more secure.\n\n816\n00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:37,310\n>> Well yeah, so I guess now that we have\nthe properties open we'll go through and\n\n817\n00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,180\njust poke around.\n\n818\n00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,752\n>> Okay.\n>> So we got in here.\n\n819\n00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,560\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> On this very first tab,\n\n820\n00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,720\nthis general tab, we have where can\nchange the address of our connection,\n\n821\n00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,605\neither a DNS name or a IP address.\n\n822\n00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:53,360\n>> Yep, so if you had missed when you\nwent through that first wizard and\n\n823\n00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,650\nyou had mistyped the IP address or\nthe name and it wouldn't work,\n\n824\n00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,100\nyou can go back into the properties and\nadjust that.\n\n825\n00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,260\nOr if the VPN server work had failed and\n\n826\n00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,350\nthey brought up a different one with\na different name or different IP address.\n\n827\n00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,950\nWe can go back in and\nadjust that accordingly.\n\n828\n00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,980\n>> We have this option down here.\n\n829\n00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,390\nFirst connect, it says.\n\n830\n00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:18,030\nSo if we do not already have\nan existing connection we can use this.\n\n831\n00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:24,260\nSo before it creates this VPN connection,\nit can dial out or\n\n832\n00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,990\nmake a new connection, and\nthen connect through that connection.\n\n833\n00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,526\n>> Yeah, because we do have,\nlike I said, we assume,\n\n834\n00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:35,580\nwe can attend to assume that\nbroadband is everywhere.\n\n835\n00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,050\nAnd that we are always connected.\n\n836\n00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,260\nIn some areas though, in order to get\nInternet access in the first place,\n\n837\n00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,250\nyou might have to dial up a connection.\n\n838\n00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,980\nSo what that allows me to do is, I know.\n\n839\n00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,830\nRight?\nIt would allow me to tell it,\n\n840\n00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,360\nwhen I double-click, instead of me\nhaving to manually dial up first and\n\n841\n00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,410\nthen double-click on the VPN object,\nI double-click on it and\n\n842\n00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,250\nit knows hey,\nfirst I'm gonna go dial this up.\n\n843\n00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,178\nEstablish my Internet connection.\n\n844\n00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:01,293\nThen I'm gonna try and\nreach out on my Internet connection and\n\n845\n00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:03,460\ntry to connect to that VPN server\nback at the corporate office.\n\n846\n00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,800\n>> And then you hit the tunnel.\n\n847\n00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,369\n>> Yeah.\n\n848\n00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,483\n>> And now you have to go\nmake that connection again.\n\n849\n00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:09,230\n>> Yeah.\n>> And your VPN connects.\n\n850\n00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,509\nFun stuff, right?\n\n851\n00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,566\nYep.\nAll right on our next tab,\n\n852\n00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:15,660\nthe Options tab.\n\n853\n00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,070\nThis is Mike's favorite,\nis remember the credentials.\n\n854\n00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,482\n>> Yes.\n>> I'm not gonna share this laptop with\n\n855\n00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:27,833\nanybody, and typing things in is really\ntough sometimes, especially on that train.\n\n856\n00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:28,594\n>> I've seen you type.\n\n857\n00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:31,328\n[LAUGH]\n>> And so the idle time before hanging up.\n\n858\n00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:36,215\nSo we're just gonna set that,\nremember the credentials and we have the.\n\n859\n00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:36,976\n>> 24 hours?\n\n860\n00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:41,016\n>> Well,\n[LAUGH] it could be a long train ride.\n\n861\n00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:41,817\n>> It could be.\n\n862\n00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:46,258\nSo typically we would set that maybe\na little lower, because if I have\n\n863\n00:40:46,258 --> 00:40:51,247\npeople dialing in and then going to make\ndinner [LAUGH] and going to see a movie.\n\n864\n00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:54,056\n[LAUGH] I've only got so\nmany connections I can have.\n\n865\n00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:56,060\nSo I'm gonna drop them.\n\n866\n00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:00,130\nIf they don't do anything for an hour,\nI'm gonna kill their connection.\n\n867\n00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,545\nProbably 20 minutes I'm gonna drop you.\n\n868\n00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:04,302\n[LAUGH] We'll let him do 24 hours.\n\n869\n00:41:04,302 --> 00:41:06,195\nI'm a little more strict.\n\n870\n00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:10,452\n[LAUGH]\n>> We've got the PPP settings.\n\n871\n00:41:10,452 --> 00:41:15,627\nAll right, and these are just\nthe settings to optimize our\n\n872\n00:41:15,627 --> 00:41:22,807\nconnection such as compression and the\nsort, so things ease up the connection,\n\n873\n00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:25,761\nmake a little bit [CROSSTALK]\n>> Make it a little faster,\n\n874\n00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:26,303\nmaybe a little smoother.\n\n875\n00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:26,814\n>> Yep.\n\n876\n00:41:26,814 --> 00:41:30,346\n>> And our security [INAUDIBLE]\nnow this is, I guess,\n\n877\n00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:33,325\nwhere all the magic happens, is in here.\n\n878\n00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:36,891\nAs Mike pointed out earlier,\nthe type of EPN,\n\n879\n00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:41,829\nit defaults to automatic and\nit will cycle through those until it\n\n880\n00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:46,503\nfinds one to negotiate with\nthe server out there and I would.\n\n881\n00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,246\n>> Exactly.\n\n882\n00:41:47,246 --> 00:41:48,158\n>> Say it works fine.\n\n883\n00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:49,219\n>> It does really.\n\n884\n00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:50,955\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It really does.\n\n885\n00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:54,277\nI mean,\nthe thing is if we leave it on automatic,\n\n886\n00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:59,396\neven if my server is only setup to\naccept L2TP IPsec-based connections.\n\n887\n00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:04,960\nWell as you can see from this list,\neventually the client is gonna try that.\n\n888\n00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,940\nBut that means it's gonna first try IKE\nand then PPTP and go through there,\n\n889\n00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,790\nwhereas if I go ahead and set that to\nwhat I know the server is expecting or\n\n890\n00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,435\nallowing, then it's just gonna make\nthe initial connection quicker,\n\n891\n00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,370\ncuz it doesn't have to try all\nthe ones that it's not accepting.\n\n892\n00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:26,830\nSo, automatic works fine or\nwe can be more specific.\n\n893\n00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,920\n>> And in this case\nthe connection we are connecting\n\n894\n00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,774\nto is going to be a PPTP connection.\n\n895\n00:42:32,774 --> 00:42:37,407\nSo we'll [CROSSTALK] select that,\nwe have a.\n\n896\n00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:41,503\nYeah so the data encryption,\nour next field,\n\n897\n00:42:41,503 --> 00:42:45,717\noptional, encryption and\nit imprints these.\n\n898\n00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:50,300\n>> It says connect even if no encryption.\n\n899\n00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,790\n>> And now and that would play into, what?\n\n900\n00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,740\nWhen would we not want any encryption?\n\n901\n00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,925\n>> I would say that in most\ncorporate environments, never.\n\n902\n00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:03,368\n[LAUGH] Honestly, you really wanna make\nsure you're encrypting that data, right?\n\n903\n00:43:03,368 --> 00:43:06,845\nSo it just depends on your\nparticular environment.\n\n904\n00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:10,640\nIf it wasn't sensitive information\nbeing transmitted, maybe.\n\n905\n00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,940\nI don't see using that\noption all that often.\n\n906\n00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,643\nSo yeah, I would almost prefer\nyou put that on encrypted.\n\n907\n00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:22,680\nAnd then I think the option says\nsomething like decline it or\n\n908\n00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,851\ndrop the connection if no encryption or\nsomething like that.\n\n909\n00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:26,687\n>> All right.\n\n910\n00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:31,312\nSo we're gonna change this one\nto require encryption, and for\n\n911\n00:43:31,312 --> 00:43:34,897\nthe C's it says disconnect\nif server declines.\n\n912\n00:43:34,897 --> 00:43:35,733\n>> Yeah that way.\n\n913\n00:43:35,733 --> 00:43:38,490\n>> PPTP is built in,\nwe shouldn't have a problem with that.\n\n914\n00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,071\n>> We shouldn't have a problem.\n\n915\n00:43:39,071 --> 00:43:44,267\nAnd if the server's trying to say that I\ndon't require authentication, I don't want\n\n916\n00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:49,179\nmy client connecting to that server,\nbecause now, what if something got changed\n\n917\n00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:53,908\non the VPN server, and for some reason\nit was no longer requiring encryption?\n\n918\n00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:58,273\nSo when my client, who doesn't really\nknow all that much probably, my end user,\n\n919\n00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:00,447\nthey're just double-clicking on it.\n\n920\n00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:03,667\nAnd if it's set up to go ahead and\ncreate the connection anyway,\n\n921\n00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:07,898\nwhether it's encrypted or not, they might\nnot be aware that all of a sudden they're\n\n922\n00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:10,716\ntransmitting data across\nan unencrypted connection.\n\n923\n00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:15,374\nSo they're sitting there sending\naccount numbers, and passwords, or\n\n924\n00:44:15,374 --> 00:44:20,960\nhealth records, or whatever, across what\nthey assumed was a protected connection.\n\n925\n00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,476\nNever even thought about it.\n\n926\n00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:22,277\n>> Game codes.\n\n927\n00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:25,342\n>> Yeah, or cheat codes for\n[INAUDIBLE] or whatever.\n\n928\n00:44:25,342 --> 00:44:27,159\nSo yeah.\n\n929\n00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:30,847\nI would almost wanna make sure, I would\nalways make sure that that was a look.\n\n930\n00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,680\nIf the server says no,\nno encryption required, don't connect.\n\n931\n00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,275\nBecause there's probably\nsomething wrong on the server end.\n\n932\n00:44:36,275 --> 00:44:37,314\nSo.\n\n933\n00:44:37,314 --> 00:44:41,030\n>> All right.\nAnd that brings us to the authentication.\n\n934\n00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:46,034\nAnd I believe yeah, we touched it on\na little, no that's right cuz I jumped\n\n935\n00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:51,525\nahead cuz when we talked about that stuff\nand there are a slew of connections here.\n\n936\n00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:55,999\nWe've got EBAYKA, EBAYKA again,\n\n937\n00:44:55,999 --> 00:45:01,523\nEEP send, EEP TTLS peak and\n[LAUGH] MS [LAUGH].\n\n938\n00:45:01,523 --> 00:45:02,481\n>> Lots of EEP in there.\n\n939\n00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:03,543\n>> Yeah, lots of EEP in there.\n\n940\n00:45:03,543 --> 00:45:06,800\n>> Yeah, well let's drop that up for\na second.\n\n941\n00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,590\nSo really when it comes down to it, and\n\n942\n00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:11,240\nthis is something that we really haven't\ndiscussed yet, we need to get to,\n\n943\n00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,450\nthat's one of our objectives, is the VPN\nauthentication methods that we can use.\n\n944\n00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:22,180\nWe talked about the tunneling protocols,\nSSTP, PPTP, L2TP, and IKEV2.\n\n945\n00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:26,330\nBut then we also have to decide what we\nwanna use for the authentication protocol.\n\n946\n00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:30,260\nHow are we going to authenticate this\nperson that's trying to establish\n\n947\n00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,330\nthis connection?\n\n948\n00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,880\nWhat method are we gonna use?\n\n949\n00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,690\nAnd if you select that option,\nbefore we go into EAP,\n\n950\n00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,710\nlet's select that allow these\nprotocols down below there.\n\n951\n00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:42,067\nCuz these are the ones that we've had for\nsome time, and\n\n952\n00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:44,291\nthey're pretty straightforward.\n\n953\n00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:48,680\nYou've got Pap, Chap, MSchap,\nand MSchap V2, I think still?\n\n954\n00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,729\n>> Yep.\n>> Actually, they've dropped MSchap.\n\n955\n00:45:50,729 --> 00:45:52,586\nIt's just MSChap V2 at this point.\n\n956\n00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:56,371\nSo PAP, never gonna use it.\n\n957\n00:45:56,371 --> 00:46:02,472\nPAP is my password authentication\nprotocol and it is plain text.\n\n958\n00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:04,440\nThat's really where we should stop.\n\n959\n00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,663\nYou shouldn't have to worry\nabout anything else with PAP,\n\n960\n00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,359\nbecause you know you're\nnever gonna use it.\n\n961\n00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,721\nBecause you're now sending your\nuser credentials unencrypted.\n\n962\n00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:17,123\nAnd if that's your work username and\npassword, and you're sitting at Starbucks,\n\n963\n00:46:17,123 --> 00:46:20,719\nand you're drinking your little\nfrappe-mocha-crappa thing, or\n\n964\n00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,625\nwhatever they get from Starbucks, and\nyou go to make your VPN connection,\n\n965\n00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:28,159\nand Nate's sitting next to you,\nand he's got wireshark running,\n\n966\n00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,512\nhe just snagged your username and\npassword that you use at work.\n\n967\n00:46:31,512 --> 00:46:34,825\nAnd so now he can try to\nestablish a VPN connection, or\n\n968\n00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:38,815\ntry to get onto your computer,\nor whatever the case may be, so.\n\n969\n00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:39,999\n>> I'll sell it.\n>> Yeah.\n\n970\n00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:41,909\n[LAUGH] Knowing Nate he probably would.\n\n971\n00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:42,646\nYou'll see it under [SOUND].\n\n972\n00:46:42,646 --> 00:46:48,334\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Make a quick dollar.\n\n973\n00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:48,955\n>> Yeah man.\n\n974\n00:46:48,955 --> 00:46:49,965\nWhatever you gotta do.\n\n975\n00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:52,856\nSo I'm never gonna use PAP, right?\n\n976\n00:46:52,856 --> 00:46:56,026\nI'm surprised it's even\nactually still an option.\n\n977\n00:46:56,026 --> 00:47:01,761\nBut I guess maybe for testing,\nI can't think of a good reason to use PAP.\n\n978\n00:47:01,761 --> 00:47:02,388\nI really can't, I've tried.\n\n979\n00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:07,378\n[LAUGH] If you had some operating system\nthat just didn't understand the other\n\n980\n00:47:07,378 --> 00:47:10,503\nprotocols, maybe that's your only choice.\n\n981\n00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:11,353\nThat's what you use.\n\n982\n00:47:11,353 --> 00:47:14,073\nBut never gonna use it, all right?\n\n983\n00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:14,933\nThen we've got CHAP.\nChallenge\n\n984\n00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:16,698\nHandshake Authentication Protocol.\n\n985\n00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:19,444\nA cool process really.\n\n986\n00:47:19,444 --> 00:47:21,004\nI don't know.\n\n987\n00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,438\nI geek out on this kinda stuff.\n\n988\n00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:24,441\nYou guys know I like\nthe security side of things.\n\n989\n00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,501\nAnd CHAP,\nChallenging Authenticating Protocol,\n\n990\n00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:32,240\nallows me to authenticate without ever\nsending my password across the network.\n\n991\n00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:32,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n992\n00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,856\nYou're like, how is that possible?\n\n993\n00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:38,555\nYeah Ronnie, he, that's right.\n\n994\n00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,610\nYeah, he drew out this big, elaborate\npicture and you pick something and\n\n995\n00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:44,860\nthis guy picks something, and then they\ndo something to it and they trade, and\n\n996\n00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,589\nif they match, then it works\nwithout ever trading the password.\n\n997\n00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:48,858\n>> Sorta kinda.\n\n998\n00:47:48,858 --> 00:47:49,740\n[LAUGH] Sorta kinda.\n\n999\n00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,830\nShould we draw it up again?\n\n1000\n00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:51,885\n>> Oh, wait, I don't have IPGA.\n\n1001\n00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:53,152\nI'm sad.\n\n1002\n00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:59,054\nYes with within protocol, the initial\nconnection when you go to establish,\n\n1003\n00:47:59,054 --> 00:48:04,282\nthe server that you're trying to connect\nto, your client requests a connection,\n\n1004\n00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:07,517\nthe server sends over\nwhat's called a challenge.\n\n1005\n00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:08,918\nIt's an arbitrary string.\n\n1006\n00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:12,455\nThat the server generates and\nsends it over to the client.\n\n1007\n00:48:12,455 --> 00:48:16,643\nNow the client is gonna take\nthat string that he sent,\n\n1008\n00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,920\nabc123 for simplicity's sake.\n\n1009\n00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,455\nAnd he's gonna take his password and\nhe's gonna make one big string out of it,\n\n1010\n00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:28,970\nabc123Pa$$w0rd, whatever my password is.\n\n1011\n00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:30,540\nDid I just give everybody your password?\n\n1012\n00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh no.\n\n1013\n00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,090\nHe's gonna plug those two values together,\nand then he's gonna run that string\n\n1014\n00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:41,250\nthrough what we call a hashing\nalgorithm and generate a hash value.\n\n1015\n00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:46,140\nAnd so the hash value is what gets sent\nback to the server, not my password.\n\n1016\n00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:51,230\nNow the server knows what the string was,\nbecause he was the one that generated it.\n\n1017\n00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:55,630\nHe also knows what my password should be,\nbecause he's got the database where my\n\n1018\n00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,540\npassword is stored,\nhe does the same thing.\n\n1019\n00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,080\nTakes the string,\ntakes what my password should be,\n\n1020\n00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,880\nplugs them together, runs them through a\nhashing algorithm, generates a hash value.\n\n1021\n00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,660\nThen he compares the hash\nvalue that I sent\n\n1022\n00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,910\nwith the hash value that he generated.\n\n1023\n00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:16,340\nIf those two match exactly, then he knows\nI typed in the right password initially.\n\n1024\n00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,090\nIf those two values don't match,\n\n1025\n00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,460\nthen he knows I did not\ntype in the right password.\n\n1026\n00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,310\nAnd all of that without ever exposing\nmy password across the network.\n\n1027\n00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:26,850\nSo it's really cool process.\n\n1028\n00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:30,290\n>> And by this time you're back in\nthe tunnel and collection drop,\n\n1029\n00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,710\nso-\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1030\n00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:36,090\nThe downside of CHAP,\nit does have some vulnerabilities, right?\n\n1031\n00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:38,370\nAnd it is an older\nauthentication protocol.\n\n1032\n00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:41,000\nIt is susceptible to some\nman in the middle attacks,\n\n1033\n00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,710\nas well as some replay attacks.\n\n1034\n00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,180\nIf you're not familiar with those\nmake sure you check out our\n\n1035\n00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,910\nSecurity Plus episode where\nwe cover some of that.\n\n1036\n00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:54,830\nSo it does have some vulnerabilities\nthere, but the nice thing is it's,\n\n1037\n00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:59,060\nif you've got non-Microsoft operating\nsystems that need to make a connection to\n\n1038\n00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,280\nyour VPN server, CHAP was one of the\nprotocols we will probably end up using.\n\n1039\n00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,098\nBecause other operating systems aren't\ngonna understand the next option which is\n\n1040\n00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:09,170\nMicrosoft CHAP.\n\n1041\n00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:12,550\nThis is their improved version of CHAP.\n\n1042\n00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,727\nThey've actually had MS-CHAP and\nnow we're one MS-CHAP V2.\n\n1043\n00:50:15,727 --> 00:50:19,070\nAnd-\n>> Just makes it better.\n\n1044\n00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:19,732\n>> It does.\n\n1045\n00:50:19,732 --> 00:50:22,061\nAnytime you put a two after something.\n\n1046\n00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,363\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's gotta be better, I mean you know?\n\n1047\n00:50:24,363 --> 00:50:25,722\nI'm Mike V2.\n\n1048\n00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:30,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No but MS-Chat V2, the improvements\n\n1049\n00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,550\nthey did, a couple of them, are gonna\nbe anti replay attack protection.\n\n1050\n00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,490\nThere's time stamp and\nsequence information in there\n\n1051\n00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:43,180\nwhich is going to prevent somebody or\nhopefully prevent somebody from doing\n\n1052\n00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:48,180\ncertain types of man in the middle attacks\nand replay attacks with those passwords.\n\n1053\n00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,290\nStart with those authentication packets.\n\n1054\n00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:55,320\nSo a little more secure, it's definitely\nthe most secure of those three options.\n\n1055\n00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,216\nBut it would not be supported by\nyour non-Microsoft operating system,\n\n1056\n00:51:00,216 --> 00:51:03,435\nso if you had Linux you\nmight have to do the CHAP.\n\n1057\n00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,270\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n1058\n00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,920\nA lot of talking, right?\n\n1059\n00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,420\n>> Yeah.\nMine intersects.\n\n1060\n00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,120\n>> Sorry.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1061\n00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,240\nNo, it's good.\n\n1062\n00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,450\nAll right.\n\n1063\n00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:17,220\nYeah, so\nwe've got those items down there and\n\n1064\n00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,130\nthen these items up here, right,\nso we've got this EAP stuff.\n\n1065\n00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,100\n>> Oh, we haven't even got to EAP.\n\n1066\n00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,020\nI forgot about that.\n\n1067\n00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,850\n>> Yeah.\nWell we've got a few minutes.\n\n1068\n00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,270\n>> Oh no.\n>> You want to blast through it?\n\n1069\n00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,060\n>> Yeah.\nSo what we're gonna do with EAP\n\n1070\n00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:27,763\nis, [SOUND].\n\n1071\n00:51:27,763 --> 00:51:30,098\nEAP is my extensive\nauthentication protocol.\n\n1072\n00:51:30,098 --> 00:51:35,243\nAnd it's really Kind of a way to,\nyou'll see that we can combine EAP\n\n1073\n00:51:35,243 --> 00:51:40,298\nwith MS- CHAP V2 and with TLS and\na few others that we really don't\n\n1074\n00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:45,875\nneed to get into in this particular,\nwe don't wanna go too far, right?\n\n1075\n00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:49,720\nI wanna make sure you guys are focusing on\nthe objectives for this particular exam.\n\n1076\n00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:54,675\nBut EAP,\nextensible authentication protocol,\n\n1077\n00:51:54,675 --> 00:51:57,162\nis what's going to be responsible for\n\n1078\n00:51:57,162 --> 00:52:02,450\nthe initial negotiation where we're\ndeciding what authentication methods and\n\n1079\n00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,950\nwhat tunneling protocols and\nthings like that, that we're going to do.\n\n1080\n00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,900\nKind of occurs at the beginning\nat the connection and\n\n1081\n00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,270\nit's extensible it can be used with other\nprotocols you don't see EAP by itself\n\n1082\n00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:20,250\nit's not really an authentication protocol\nin and of it itself it's a channel that we\n\n1083\n00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,940\ncan use with these other authentication\nprotocols to help keep them safe.\n\n1084\n00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,790\nSo you'll see EAP, MS-CHAP V2.\n\n1085\n00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:31,980\nWhich means we are going to take EAP and\nthrow MS-CHAP underneath that or\n\n1086\n00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,520\nkind of use EAP to kind of\nprotect the MS-CHAP process.\n\n1087\n00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,290\nOr EAP-TLS, transport layer security.\n\n1088\n00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:41,770\nAnd then when we get back,\nmaybe we can even mention PEAP,\n\n1089\n00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:45,480\nwhere we've got our Protected\nExtensible Authentication Protocol.\n\n1090\n00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,130\nBut the idea extensible,\n\n1091\n00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,990\nthat means I can extend that protocol\nto work with other protocols.\n\n1092\n00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,641\n>> That's a good way of putting it.\n\n1093\n00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:53,326\n>> Yeah.\n\n1094\n00:52:53,326 --> 00:52:54,302\nHence the word extensible.\n\n1095\n00:52:54,302 --> 00:52:55,720\n>> Ha, ha, ha.\n\n1096\n00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,694\nThere you go.\n>> All right.\n\n1097\n00:52:57,694 --> 00:52:59,120\n>> Right on.\n\n1098\n00:52:59,120 --> 00:52:59,820\nSweet.\n\n1099\n00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,230\nWe're on our break.\n\n1100\n00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n1101\n00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,180\nTime flies when you're having fun.\n\n1102\n00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,740\nI hope you guys are having\nas much as we

00:53:13,030\nanother break so get up,\nstretch the legs refuel the caffeine.\n\n1106\n00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:13,940\nDo the jumping jacks.\n\n1107\n00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,990\nGet the blood flowing again.\n\n1108\n00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:19,780\n>> And\nwe'll connect when we get back,right?\n\n1109\n00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,287\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n1110\n00:53:20,287 -->

so\nwe're going to pick up where we left off.\n\n1114\n00:53:35,275 --> 00:53:36,620\n>> Yep, if we can remember.\n\n1115\n00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,008\n>> Yeah, with the VPN stuff.\n\n1116\n00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:40,869\n>> Yeah.\nWe were going through our VPN protocols,\n\n1117\n00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:42,914\nor we're going through our\nVPN connection object, and\n\n1118\n00:53:42,914 --> 00:53:45,450\nlooking at all the different myriad\nof options that we have in there.\n\n1119\n00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,030\n>> Myriad.\n\n1120\n00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,900\n>> To set that up.\n\n1121\n00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,466\nWhich I think we'll just\nflip right back over to,\n\n1122\n00:53:49,466 --> 00:53:51,310\nand did we get through\nall the tabs already?\n\n1123\n00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,570\n>> No, we have two tabs left.\n\n1124\n00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:55,730\nWell, there's not really a whole\nlot to discuss in those two tabs.\n\n1125\n00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,459\n>> Let's look at them anyway.\n\n1126\n00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:58,814\nLet's do it.\n\n1127\n00:53:58,814 --> 00:53:59,860\n>> We'll cover it.\n\n1128\n00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,763\nAll right, networking and sharing.\n\n1129\n00:54:00,763 --> 00:54:03,980\nAll right, now.\n\n1130\n00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,537\nSo our next tab that we have is\nthe networking tab is where we\n\n1131\n00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:13,466\ncan set individual settings for\nthe network comparing\n\n1132\n00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:19,920\nthe protocols-\n>> Just like on your network adapter on\n\n1133\n00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,130\nyour machine, you got a list of protocols\nthat your network adapter can speak.\n\n1134\n00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,570\nThese are the protocols that\nyour VPN connection can use.\n\n1135\n00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,887\nSo is your corporate network\nset up to support IPv6?\n\n1136\n00:54:28,887 --> 00:54:30,440\nMaybe you wanna use that.\n\n1137\n00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,010\nAgain, with Windows 8 2012,\nit's going to use those first if it can,\n\n1138\n00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:39,400\nbut it depends on if you've got IPv6\naddresses assigned and things like that,\n\n1139\n00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,710\nand that's a whole other episode there.\n\n1140\n00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:43,680\nSo, yeah, pick your protocols.\n\n1141\n00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,490\nTypically, you just\nleave all those checked.\n\n1142\n00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,890\nUnless there was something were I just\ndid not want my VPN clients using IPv6.\n\n1143\n00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:53,118\nI could come in here and I could\nuncheck that, on the client den, and\n\n1144\n00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:54,433\nthey wouldn't use IPv6.\n\n1145\n00:54:54,433 --> 00:54:58,800\nI mean typically we want file and\nprinter sharing, right?\n\n1146\n00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,350\nWe want client for Microsoft Networks,\nwe want IPv, or mv6 for that matter.\n\n1147\n00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:06,798\nI usually don't change too much there,\nand you can add additional protocols,\n\n1148\n00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:09,039\nmaybe you need it to connect to a-\n>> IPX SPX.\n\n1149\n00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,183\n>> Yeah do a little Novel maybe get\nsome Novel file servers on there\n\n1150\n00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:15,687\nthat are still using IPX SPX\n>> You gotta get\n\n1151\n00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,500\nthat-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1152\n00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,640\n>> Return on investment,right.\n\n1153\n00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,660\n>> Yeah, roi-\n>> Keyboard stuff for a reason\n\n1154\n00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,500\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1155\n00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:28,350\nStill have NT servers sitting out there\nin some networks because they still\n\n1156\n00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:29,630\ndo run, so.\n\n1157\n00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,630\n>> So, now like on these options here.\n\n1158\n00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:35,150\nSo we'll just click on this IPv4 and\n\n1159\n00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:39,959\nthere will be fewer selections then\non a typical network connection.\n\n1160\n00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:45,197\nAnd here we can only pick, let's say\nwe wanna chose a particular IP address\n\n1161\n00:55:45,197 --> 00:55:50,847\nwe'll that's it, we can pick an IP and a\nDNS we can not pick our default gateway or\n\n1162\n00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,230\na subnet mask-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1163\n00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:56,615\n>> So we have limited options\non what we're gonna do here.\n\n1164\n00:55:56,615 --> 00:56:00,132\nTypically I think it would be\nsafe to say that the place\n\n1165\n00:56:00,132 --> 00:56:04,897\nyou're connecting to the VPN, I mean\nall this stuff is gonna be set up and\n\n1166\n00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:07,888\nconfigured to where\nthe defaults will work.\n\n1167\n00:56:07,888 --> 00:56:11,965\n>> Yeah, we're typically using DHCP to\nassign the a addresses to the VPN clients\n\n1168\n00:56:11,965 --> 00:56:12,845\nas they come in.\n\n1169\n00:56:12,845 --> 00:56:17,118\nSo I don't know that I've ever seen\na Anybody statically map, a VPN client,\n\n1170\n00:56:17,118 --> 00:56:22,910\nwithout to say that it can't be done, or\nthat someplace's, need that functionality.\n\n1171\n00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,840\nSo it definitely can go in there and\nstatically map.\n\n1172\n00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,756\nBut usually we're just picking up\nthe options from the VPN server, and\n\n1173\n00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:30,012\nthen they're going to handle\nthe routing on that end.\n\n1174\n00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,720\nThat's gonna give us that connection\nback to the corporate network.\n\n1175\n00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,710\nAnd then whether they've got routing\nsetup properly, whether I can get\n\n1176\n00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:40,620\nback out to the internet once I've\nconnected to that VPN connection.\n\n1177\n00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,800\nSo they'll give me my default gateway\nif I need one and things like that.\n\n1178\n00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,400\n>> Yep.\n\n1179\n00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,710\nOn the last one, on our sharing tab right?\n\n1180\n00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:51,330\nThis is the internet connection sharing\non whether we want other devices to\n\n1181\n00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:56,270\nbe able to connect through our VPN and\nconnect out.\n\n1182\n00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:59,730\nNow, VPNs I would say more or\n\n1183\n00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:06,090\nless I-\n>> If you had a situation where,\n\n1184\n00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:10,090\nokay, I'm in a place where I've connected\nto the VPN server back at work.\n\n1185\n00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,787\nAnd then they've got it set up where I\ncan get internet access through that\n\n1186\n00:57:12,787 --> 00:57:13,710\nconnection.\n\n1187\n00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,840\nThen I got a coworker with\nme in that hotel room,\n\n1188\n00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,340\nor we're traveling as a group or whatever,\n\n1189\n00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:23,500\nthey could then piggyback on top of my\nconnection and gain internet access there.\n\n1190\n00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,140\nOr they setup their own VPN connection,\nit really just depends.\n\n1191\n00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,320\nIt used to be a lot more common with\nthe internet connection sharing,\n\n1192\n00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,300\nwhen you had before these little\ndevices broadband routers and\n\n1193\n00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,790\nthings like that were really as cheap and\nas accessible as they are now.\n\n1194\n00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:42,430\nBut if you had more devices that needed to\nconnect you can establish one VPN tunnel\n\n1195\n00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,270\nand then allow all those other\ndevices to come through that.\n\n1196\n00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:50,040\n>> So then you could have open\nthe connection on this and\n\n1197\n00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,210\nthen use your smartphone?\n\n1198\n00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,660\n>> Yeah.\n>> And just chill out on the couch\n\n1199\n00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,870\nwith your tablet, and just like ch-ch.\n\n1200\n00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:55,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n1201\n00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,060\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n1202\n00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,040\n>> And just surf it.\n\n1203\n00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,590\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1204\n00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,890\n>> Nice.\nNow that brings us to, I guess,\n\n1205\n00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,320\nthe end of our little tabs.\n\n1206\n00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,450\n>> Yeah, that's all the tabs.\n\n1207\n00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:07,680\nNow, what is that whatever\nI want properties, nice.\n\n1208\n00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,200\nI like that.\n\n1209\n00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,160\n>> Well you said name it whatever I want.\n\n1210\n00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:10,960\n>> I did, didn't I?\n\n1211\n00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,780\nI did say that.\n\n1212\n00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,190\n>> So I did.\n>> Okay, so.\n\n1213\n00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,020\nVery good.\n\n1214\n00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,135\nYou have to be literal.\n\n1215\n00:58:16,135 --> 00:58:19,265\n[LAUGH]\nWhere was I going with that?\n\n1216\n00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:23,110\nThat is a good segue into one\nof the other things that we need\n\n1217\n00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:28,180\nto talk about in this episode, is gonna be\nthe connection manager administration kit.\n\n1218\n00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,840\nSo we see all those options that we\ncan configure in that VPN connection\n\n1219\n00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,600\nobject that we gotta create.\n\n1220\n00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,530\nAnd that has to be created on each\nclient that's gonna establish that\n\n1221\n00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:37,510\nVPN connection.\n\n1222\n00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,730\nSo I've got dozens or\n\n1223\n00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,940\nhundreds of laptops that I've gotta\nset up in my corporate environment.\n\n1224\n00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,850\nI have worked with different\ncompanies where we have posted\n\n1225\n00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:52,270\nwebsites where the end user wants to make\na remote access connection from home.\n\n1226\n00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:57,270\nI've got a webpage up there with\nstep by step by step instructions\n\n1227\n00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,550\non what they need to do.\n\n1228\n00:58:58,550 --> 00:58:59,990\n>> Do they get it right every time?\n\n1229\n00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:01,530\n>> Yeah.\n\n1230\n00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:03,225\nI don't think they've\never gotten it right.\n\n1231\n00:59:03,225 --> 00:59:03,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hey,\n\n1232\n00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:06,410\nMike, I'm having trouble getting\nthis VPN connection set up.\n\n1233\n00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,499\nCan you help me out here?\n\n1234\n00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,760\nThey can't fault.\n\n1235\n00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,520\nAnd then not to say anything\nbad about my end users.\n\n1236\n00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,100\nBut they're not computer people.\n\n1237\n00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,790\nThey don't wanna be computer people.\n\n1238\n00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,130\nThey do their job.\n\n1239\n00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:18,590\nI do my job.\n\n1240\n00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:23,850\nSo either they bring me their laptop and\nI set it up for them,\n\n1241\n00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:27,630\nwhich means I've got a line of people out\nin the hallway bringing me their laptop to\n\n1242\n00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:31,270\nset up these connections and I'm doing\nit one at a time and if I've got to do\n\n1243\n00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,960\na couple hundred of these things or if\ntheir's computer at home how do they bring\n\n1244\n00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,430\ntheir home computer into me to let me\nset up their VPN connection for them.\n\n1245\n00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:41,960\nTheir connection manager administration\n\n1246\n00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,640\nkit is a wizard that I can\nrun on my computer, and\n\n1247\n00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,935\nI can go through all those same options\nand I can generate an executable.\n\n1248\n00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:54,575\nAnd then all I have to do is\ndistribute that executable and\n\n1249\n00:59:54,575 --> 00:59:58,445\nI can distribute it any way I\nnormally distribute software.\n\n1250\n00:59:58,445 --> 01:00:01,175\nI can give them a thumb drive\nthat has that executable on it.\n\n1251\n01:00:01,175 --> 01:00:04,250\nThey can plug it in their machine at home,\ndouble click on it and\n\n1252\n01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,950\nit's gonna create all that\nstuff we just went through.\n\n1253\n01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,580\nIt's gonna create it for them.\n\n1254\n01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,450\nI can put it up on a file share and\nthey can download it from the share and\n\n1255\n01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,440\nrun it on their laptop.\n\n1256\n01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,810\nI can use group policy or\nsomething to distribute that out.\n\n1257\n01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:22,500\nAnd that way I eliminate\na lot of the issues that\n\n1258\n01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,580\nwe're gonna run into with them calling me\nup saying this isn't working, because I\n\n1259\n01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:30,040\nwent through the wizard myself, and I\nknow that everything in there is correct.\n\n1260\n01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,210\nSo I can eliminate when\nI'm troubleshooting.\n\n1261\n01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,450\nI know it's not the IP address,\nthe VPN server.\n\n1262\n01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:38,320\nI know it's not the protocols because\nI chose all that in the wizard.\n\n1263\n01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,020\nSo we can jump forward in\nour troubleshooting process.\n\n1264\n01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,730\nSo it's a fantastic thing,\nthe connection manager administration kit.\n\n1265\n01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:47,785\nOne thing we need to know for the exam for\n\n1266\n01:00:47,785 --> 01:00:51,838\nthis one is when you run through\nthe connection manager administration kit,\n\n1267\n01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:56,000\nyou have to tell it if you're making\nit for Vista or later or XP and prior.\n\n1268\n01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,940\nBecause it will create\na different executable for\n\n1269\n01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,610\nthose different operating systems.\n\n1270\n01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:06,390\nSo if I had both XP clients and\nWindows 7 clients that I needed\n\n1271\n01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:09,795\nto setup to have this remote access I'd\nhave to run through that wizard twice.\n\n1272\n01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:12,910\nOnce for to create an executable that\nwould work on Windows 7, Windows 8.\n\n1273\n01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:18,480\nOne to create an executable that\nwould work on Windows XP environment.\n\n1274\n01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n1275\n01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,930\n>> And as we were talking before the show,\nsorry I cut you off there.\n\n1276\n01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,070\n>> No, not at all.\n\n1277\n01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:26,370\n>> We were talking about\nthe connection manager administration\n\n1278\n01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:27,660\nkit before the show.\n\n1279\n01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,070\nThere's a lot of options in there,\naren't there?\n\n1280\n01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,680\n>> Oh, yeah.\nPlenty.\n\n1281\n01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,190\n>> It's very customizable.\n\n1282\n01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,370\nYou can change the logos.\n\n1283\n01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:43,870\nYou can include custom phone books for\ndial up connections.\n\n1284\n01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:47,110\nEven the little question mark up on\nthe top right where they click for\n\n1285\n01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:49,010\nhelp, that generic thing.\n\n1286\n01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:54,430\nI can put my own custom help file, my own\nCHM file to where when they click on that\n\n1287\n01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:58,240\nthey don't get generic Microsoft help,\nthey get company specific information.\n\n1288\n01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,710\nLike, hey,\nhere's Nate's cell phone number.\n\n1289\n01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:03,565\nCall him 24 hours a day,\nseven days a week, he doesn't care.\n\n1290\n01:02:03,565 --> 01:02:04,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1291\n01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,740\nLike if you hear clicking on this then\nyou are lost and just forget about it.\n\n1292\n01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,390\nJust, close the lid.\n\n1293\n01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:14,070\nPut it back in the box and\njust, you're done [LAUGH].\n\n1294\n01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,270\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1295\n01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:19,930\nSo, that connection manager\nadministration kit is really cool and\n\n1296\n01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,310\nI don't think we're gonna probably,\n\n1297\n01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:24,070\nI dunno if we're gonna run through\nthat in here on this particular app.\n\n1298\n01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:24,670\n>> We could.\n\n1299\n01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:25,550\n>> Maybe.\nAnd if we do,\n\n1300\n01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:28,590\nif we got time we'll give you\nguys a look at that as well.\n\n1301\n01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:29,980\nSo now you got it all set up.\n\n1302\n01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:30,720\nIt's ready to go.\n\n1303\n01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,510\nWe should be able to double click on it,\nright, and see what happens.\n\n1304\n01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,690\n>> All right.\n\n1305\n01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,010\nWe're going to connect to this guy.\n\n1306\n01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,790\nAnd over here.\n\n1307\n01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,680\nRight.\nAnd this little icon.\n\n1308\n01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,160\nMike do you know what this\nicon is supposed to represent?\n\n1309\n01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,292\n>> It's infinity times infinity.\n\n1310\n01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:51,272\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] Remember that?\n\n1311\n01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:53,570\nYeah.\n\n1312\n01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:59,270\nNo, that is just there as a VPN\nconnection icon they might use.\n\n1313\n01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:03,920\nI'm sure it might have some significance\nto somebody, but not to me.\n\n1314\n01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:04,675\n>> Right on.\n\n1315\n01:03:04,675 --> 01:03:07,150\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1316\n01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,690\nNow oh, that's right.\n\n1317\n01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,530\nI clicked,\nremember my credentials from before.\n\n1318\n01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,760\n>> Oh you did, didn't you?\n\n1319\n01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,780\n>> It didn't prompt me for my stuff.\n\n1320\n01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,340\nNow, it-\n>> Did you connect?\n\n1321\n01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:21,990\n>> Yeah.\n\n1322\n01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,940\n>> And it shows connected, nice.\n\n1323\n01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,355\nNotice it picked PPTP.\n\n1324\n01:03:25,355 --> 01:03:25,940\n>> Yeah.\nPPTP.\n\n1325\n01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,500\nWell we were going through\nthe wizard I ended on\n\n1326\n01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,838\n>> Oh you didn't leave it on automatic.?\n\n1327\n01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:31,351\n>> No.\n>> Okay, I was going to say if you leave\n\n1328\n01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:33,516\nit on automatic,\nyou'll can actually watch it there,\n\n1329\n01:03:33,516 --> 01:03:36,050\nyou'll see that through the other\nprotocols and trying them.\n\n1330\n01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,380\nBut very cool, so yeah it worked.\n\n1331\n01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,070\n>> Yep.\n\n1332\n01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:42,120\nNow, so where's all the fireworks, right?\n\n1333\n01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:48,860\nIt connects, and\nthat's kind of really all there is to it.\n\n1334\n01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:55,750\nOne of the surefire signs, and I guess\nit's being covered up behind a little box.\n\n1335\n01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,423\nIs my internet connection, right?\n\n1336\n01:03:58,423 --> 01:04:01,185\nThe little icon down at the bottom,\n\n1337\n01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:06,340\nit will now show limited because\nnow that I am connected to the VPN,\n\n1338\n01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:10,227\nmy traffic is being routed\nthen through that VPN.\n\n1339\n01:04:10,227 --> 01:04:16,324\nAnd the normal connection,\nit's switched down to limited,\n\n1340\n01:04:16,324 --> 01:04:19,650\nso on that little\n>> Yeah, it is\n\n1341\n01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:23,260\nactually something that we have to deal\nwith a lot in a corporate environment,\n\n1342\n01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:27,680\nit's kind of a pain because once you've\nestablished that VPN connection,\n\n1343\n01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,370\nall your external traffic is\nnow going through that tunnel.\n\n1344\n01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:36,560\nSo you can lose internet connectivity if\nit's not set up properly at the corporate\n\n1345\n01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:41,130\nend, they have to take your traffic and\nthen route it out your gateway,\n\n1346\n01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:45,310\nback into the corporate network and\nthen back through the tunnel back to you.\n\n1347\n01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:48,780\nThere are ways you can go,\nit's a Pain to set it up.\n\n1348\n01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,680\nThere are ways that you can\nsplit that VPN tunnel so\n\n1349\n01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,440\nthat they can still get VPN access\nas well as internet access.\n\n1350\n01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,090\nBut it is true.\n\n1351\n01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,901\nOne of the things that we deal with all\nthe time is people make this remote access\n\n1352\n01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:01,419\nconnection.\n\n1353\n01:05:01,419 --> 01:05:02,598\nAnd they are like.\n\n1354\n01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:03,503\n>> What?\n\n1355\n01:05:03,503 --> 01:05:05,800\n>> I don't get it.\n\n1356\n01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,790\nNothing, because they're\nexpecting remote control, right?\n\n1357\n01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:10,170\nThey're thinking remote desktop,\n\n1358\n01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:13,940\nthat when I make this connection I\nshould see this other machine's desktop.\n\n1359\n01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,277\nI should see something different, right?\n\n1360\n01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:16,340\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1361\n01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,310\n>> And it's not.\n\n1362\n01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:20,340\nIt's just like you've plugged\nyour computer into the network so\n\n1363\n01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,440\nyou don't see anything different.\n\n1364\n01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,450\nBut, when you go browse shares,\n\n1365\n01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:28,820\nwhen you're at home you can't connect\nto the F drive back at work can you?\n\n1366\n01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,810\nBut if you get a VPN connection setup all\nof a sudden you can get to the F drive\n\n1367\n01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,610\nthat mapped drive back at work,\nor you can get to a printer\n\n1368\n01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:40,030\nthat's at the work environment because\nyou're now connected to the work network.\n\n1369\n01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,220\nSo any shares that you have\npermissions to connect to.\n\n1370\n01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,110\nYou can now connect to.\n\n1371\n01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,670\nAny printers, whatever the case may be.\n\n1372\n01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,439\nIt is strange I think for\npeople the first time, they're like.\n\n1373\n01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:51,870\nI don't see anything different.\n\n1374\n01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:53,270\nWhat's the difference?\n\n1375\n01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:56,890\nAnd it's just the fact that you can\nnow connect all those work resources.\n\n1376\n01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:59,450\n>> Yep.\nAnd now what we're gonna do here\n\n1377\n01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:03,050\nis we'll open up a command prompt, and\nlet's just bold the RIP properties.\n\n1378\n01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:04,440\n>> Okay.\n\n1379\n01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,320\n>> I will make that slightly larger.\n\n1380\n01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:06,996\n>> So what is that ENS?\n\n1381\n01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,390\nCMD.\n\n1382\n01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:13,619\n>> Just kidding.\n\n1383\n01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:17,238\n>> What's that?\n\n1384\n01:06:17,238 --> 01:06:19,619\n>> nice.\nI can see that even.\n\n1385\n01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:25,390\n>> Okay, and just a simple IP config.\n\n1386\n01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,424\nAll right and we'll get the stuff.\n\n1387\n01:06:27,424 --> 01:06:34,599\nThis one, yeah, so this one here in\nthe middle, this is my original internet.\n\n1388\n01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:35,830\n>> Your physical network adapter.\n\n1389\n01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:36,654\n>> Physical network adapter.\n\n1390\n01:06:36,654 --> 01:06:37,815\nThanks, that was a good way of putting it.\n\n1391\n01:06:37,815 --> 01:06:39,737\nAnd all right, so there's that.\n\n1392\n01:06:39,737 --> 01:06:44,512\nAnd then we have this other\nnumber up here if I can scroll.\n\n1393\n01:06:44,512 --> 01:06:49,460\nAll right so\nwe got the PPP adapter of whatever I want.\n\n1394\n01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:54,600\nRight, and it has its own IP address\n>> So\n\n1395\n01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,920\nthat's your tunnel adapter,\nthat's your connection back to work, and\n\n1396\n01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,470\nthat's a completely different network,\nright?\n\n1397\n01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:05,270\nThat's your IP address that's\nvalid on your corporate network or\n\n1398\n01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:06,340\nwherever you're connecting to.\n\n1399\n01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,030\n>> Yep.\n\n1400\n01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:11,130\nNow Mike, I'll tell you a little secret.\n\n1401\n01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,905\nThis right here is\nconnecting back to my house.\n\n1402\n01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,449\n>> Right.\n>> Through the internet-\n\n1403\n01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:16,099\n>> Oo\n\n1404\n01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,022\n>> So this is as far as were gonna take\n\n1405\n01:07:18,022 --> 01:07:21,580\nit, we're not gonna-\n>> We don't wanna see your home network.\n\n1406\n01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,080\n>> No, no, no.\n\n1407\n01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,830\nSo we're not gonna go and\nbrowse shares and-\n\n1408\n01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:28,130\n>> Now the whole world has your public,\n\n1409\n01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:31,610\nor, that's a private network OS.\n\n1410\n01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:32,490\n>> That's fine.\n\n1411\n01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:36,570\nBut yeah, that's as far as we'll go,\nbut we are connected.\n\n1412\n01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:38,000\nWe're pulling an IP address.\n\n1413\n01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,740\nIt's a DHCP address, pulling down,\nand yeah, and that's it.\n\n1414\n01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:46,610\nSo, no real great big fireworks.\n\n1415\n01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,550\n>> No.\n>> And cool fun stuff, but\n\n1416\n01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:51,850\nit does connect\n>> It's the convenience.\n\n1417\n01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:54,780\nIt's the ability to be sitting\nsomewhere other than work and\n\n1418\n01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,440\nstill be able to access\nall my work resources.\n\n1419\n01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,420\nNow my sales people can travel and\n\n1420\n01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,530\nthey don't have to remember to\nbring everything with them.\n\n1421\n01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,850\nIf they forgot something, they can\nestablish that remote access connection\n\n1422\n01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:09,310\nback to work and they can grab\na copy of that file from the share.\n\n1423\n01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,130\nThey can connect to that application\nthat's running back on the corporate\n\n1424\n01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:16,160\nnetwork and verify that our inventory is\nsufficient to support this order that\n\n1425\n01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,260\nthey're out there trying to sell, hey let\nme check and see if we can have that for\n\n1426\n01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:22,230\nyou this Friday,\nI think we can get 2,000 units out to you.\n\n1427\n01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,560\nLet's see what we've got on stock.\n\n1428\n01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,560\nThat kind of thing,\nthey can connect back to work and\n\n1429\n01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,240\nthey can be productive, even when they\nare not connected to the work network.\n\n1430\n01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,914\nIt's a very,\nvery cool little technology, love it.\n\n1431\n01:08:38,797 --> 01:08:40,063\nTrying to think, okay let's see.\n\n1432\n01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,711\nWe talked about the,\n\n1433\n01:08:40,711 --> 01:08:42,800\nwhy don't we show them the connection\nmanager administration kit.\n\n1434\n01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,750\nYou want to pull that up?\n\n1435\n01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,170\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> You have that installed?\n\n1436\n01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:45,680\n>> Yep yep.\n\n1437\n01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,580\n>> All right, so\nlet's take a look at that real quick.\n\n1438\n01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,580\nThey do go through it.\n\n1439\n01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,310\nIt is I think part of our objectives.\n\n1440\n01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:54,210\nIt's gonna be on the exam, you might see\na question or two about what the heck this\n\n1441\n01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:57,790\nconnection manager administration kit\nis so we'll take a quick peek at it.\n\n1442\n01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:03,290\nIt's actually something on a server,\nyou can install it it's a feature so\n\n1443\n01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:07,140\nin server 2012 I can just go into\nmy features and I can add that\n\n1444\n01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,920\non yours I assume you probably had\nto download that from Microsoft or\n\n1445\n01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,640\nwas it already built into Windows 8?\n\n1446\n01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,400\nYep, already built in.\n\n1447\n01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,980\nSame was as the server way,\nI pulled this up,\n\n1448\n01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,860\nright, turn windows features on and off.\n\n1449\n01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:22,430\nAnd there's a setting on here for razz\nconnection manager administration kit.\n\n1450\n01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:27,600\nI clicked it before and\nit takes a second to do.\n\n1451\n01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,860\nI simply checked that box, and clicked.\n\n1452\n01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,560\nOkay.\n\n1453\n01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,377\nAnd then it pulled those binaries out\nof its little files tucked away and\n\n1454\n01:09:36,377 --> 01:09:37,429\nbrought it up.\n\n1455\n01:09:37,429 --> 01:09:38,051\n>> Good deal.\n\n1456\n01:09:38,051 --> 01:09:42,350\n>> Now to get there.\n\n1457\n01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:47,830\nWe will get to administrative tools\n>> Yeah, administrative tool.\n\n1458\n01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,035\nHow else?\nHow would you get there?\n\n1459\n01:09:49,035 --> 01:09:53,475\n>> That's a perfectly good way to do it,\nand you should probably know that way for\n\n1460\n01:09:53,475 --> 01:09:54,090\nthe exam.\n\n1461\n01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:55,170\nBut it is Windows 8.\n\n1462\n01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:58,100\nShouldn't I just be able to type\nconnections manager and go right to it and\n\n1463\n01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,220\nnot have to go through\nmy administrative tools?\n\n1464\n01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,340\nI fight with people\nabout this all the time.\n\n1465\n01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,040\nI'm just giving Nate a hard time here.\n\n1466\n01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,750\n>> We could just set a shortcut and\nset it on the desktop.\n\n1467\n01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,900\n>> We could.\n>> Or we could just e-mail\n\n1468\n01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,790\nit to ourselves.\n\n1469\n01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,070\n>> We could.\n\n1470\n01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:15,090\nBut it is funny, when you talk to people\nand they're like, that's the whole benefit\n\n1471\n01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,940\nof Windows 8, right, is,\nI don't have to know where anything is.\n\n1472\n01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:21,370\nI don't have to know what applet it is\nunder Control Panel, I can just type\n\n1473\n01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:27,005\nthe name, and I should be able to connect\ntake, work smarter, not harder, right?\n\n1474\n01:10:27,005 --> 01:10:29,585\nBut again, for the exam,\nhe brings up a valid point.\n\n1475\n01:10:29,585 --> 01:10:33,545\nWe need to know where it puts it for\nthe exam.\n\n1476\n01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:36,450\nAs you can see here,\nhe's gone into his control panel.\n\n1477\n01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:40,640\nSystem in something if I remember\ncorrectly in administrative tools?\n\n1478\n01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,040\n>> Oh system and security.\n\n1479\n01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,990\n>> System and security and\nthen administrative tools and\n\n1480\n01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:48,170\nthen you'll find that connection\nmanager administration kit.\n\n1481\n01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,650\nIt's fired up, let's see you\nalready got fired up, I'm behind.\n\n1482\n01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:52,580\n>> I'll minimize that.\n\n1483\n01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,270\n>> There we go.\n\n1484\n01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:57,430\n>> Yup.\nIt starts off by setting the profile.\n\n1485\n01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:01,690\nLike what Mike was talking about,\nso we Vista or above.\n\n1486\n01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:05,605\nOr 2003 to XP or Windows 2000.\n\n1487\n01:11:05,605 --> 01:11:09,468\nIf [LAUGH] supporting\ncomputers [CROSSTALK] come on.\n\n1488\n01:11:09,468 --> 01:11:13,997\nSo, those guys will yet drag down our\nproductivity by requiring their own\n\n1489\n01:11:13,997 --> 01:11:19,276\nseparate little connection profile,\nI mean they just laugh the whole time.\n\n1490\n01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:20,760\n>> Crazy, right?\n\n1491\n01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,600\n>> So we'll just do Vista and\nabove and click through.\n\n1492\n01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,490\nShould we go through this entire wizard?\n\n1493\n01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:32,140\n>> We might skip a few pages of real quick\nit's pretty straightforward, guys, and\n\n1494\n01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:32,960\nyou should try it out.\n\n1495\n01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,670\nYou should install the feature even if you\ndon't have a VPN server to connect to.\n\n1496\n01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:41,130\nRun through the wizard, take look at\nthe options, but know, on the exam,\n\n1497\n01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,750\nthey don't expect you to know every\nsingle option or anything like that for\n\n1498\n01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:48,250\nthe connection manager administration kit,\nknow what we use it for.\n\n1499\n01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:52,059\nTo create this executable that we can give\nto the clients that they can run on their\n\n1500\n01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:55,981\nmachine, so they don't have to know how to\nset up the VPN connection themselves and\n\n1501\n01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:59,422\nall the different security protocols and\noptions and things like that.\n\n1502\n01:11:59,422 --> 01:12:04,195\nAnd that it can be used to create,\nthis will work for VPNs or dial-up.\n\n1503\n01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:04,786\nRight?\n\n1504\n01:12:04,786 --> 01:12:08,010\nSo if I've got machines that\nare running dial-up connections,\n\n1505\n01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:12,302\nI can use this To create their connection\nobject that's in their network connection.\n\n1506\n01:12:12,302 --> 01:12:15,330\nAnd we'll go through a couple,\nand then we'll skip a couple.\n\n1507\n01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,890\nIt starts out with just, do you want to\nwalk through it and want me to narrate, or\n\n1508\n01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:18,821\ndo you want to talk about it?\n\n1509\n01:12:18,821 --> 01:12:19,530\n>> Whichever.\n\n1510\n01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:23,630\n>> So, on that first screen, either\ncreate a new one or modify an existing.\n\n1511\n01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,100\nWe don't have one yet,\nso we create a new one.\n\n1512\n01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,738\nWe give it a name.\n\n1513\n01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:32,153\nAnd this is just gonna be, again, just\na user-friendly name, could be anything,\n\n1514\n01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:34,390\ndoesn't have any functionality.\n\n1515\n01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:37,376\nThis is gonna be the final name,\nso the actual executable,\n\n1516\n01:12:37,376 --> 01:12:38,821\nwhat do you wanna call that?\n\n1517\n01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:39,696\n>> Yeah, that works.\n\n1518\n01:12:39,696 --> 01:12:40,531\n>> Works for me.\n\n1519\n01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:43,280\nAnd we'll click Next.\n\n1520\n01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,320\n>> Realm name.\n\n1521\n01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,060\n>> What is it, realm names we don't\nneed in our Windows environment.\n\n1522\n01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,372\nIf we were in Unix, Linux,\nwe might need to include a realm name so\n\n1523\n01:12:50,372 --> 01:12:51,530\nwe can just skip that.\n\n1524\n01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:53,708\nAs far as your-\n>> Oh,\n\n1525\n01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:58,446\nI clicked through it earlier just in case\nwe didn't have enough time, I created one.\n\n1526\n01:12:58,446 --> 01:12:59,780\n>> Okay, so\nyou've got one already created.\n\n1527\n01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:03,910\n>> So we won't merge any, oh yes, so\nthis for merging previous profiles\n\n1528\n01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:08,322\nif we're updating some settings or\nsomething to merge it which we won't.\n\n1529\n01:13:08,322 --> 01:13:11,565\n>> Yeah, if we already had one and we\njust needed to make a few slight changes,\n\n1530\n01:13:11,565 --> 01:13:14,303\nwe could bring that in and\nnot have to hit every screen in here.\n\n1531\n01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:17,238\nPhone book we'll skip by\nbecause we're not doing.\n\n1532\n01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:21,570\nWait, we've got VPN selected on that one,\nI think back there, yeah.\n\n1533\n01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:24,580\nSo we're not doing phone books cuz\nwe're not doing dial-up connections or\n\n1534\n01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:28,600\nanything like that, we skip right past\nthat, again, we're not doing this.\n\n1535\n01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:35,105\nSo you wanna uncheck that automatically\ndownload phonebook updates.\n\n1536\n01:13:35,105 --> 01:13:36,810\nAnd in the real world,\nif we were using dial-up,\n\n1537\n01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,860\nwe'd want them to get,\nif we made changes to the phonebook.\n\n1538\n01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,350\nI changed the numbers on\nthe modems that we have.\n\n1539\n01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:45,130\nI'd wanna update that automatically,\nbut here we're not doing dial-ups.\n\n1540\n01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,935\nWe skipped that one.\n\n1541\n01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:51,090\nWhere yeah, we don't need any\ndial-up networking entries there.\n\n1542\n01:13:53,085 --> 01:13:53,895\n>> Routing tables?\n\n1543\n01:13:53,895 --> 01:13:57,055\n>> Yeah, we're not gonna modify anybody's\nrouting tables or anything like that.\n\n1544\n01:13:57,055 --> 01:13:57,945\n>> Proxy settings?\n\n1545\n01:13:57,945 --> 01:13:59,175\n>> We don't need any proxy settings.\n\n1546\n01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:01,985\nIf you had to connect to a proxy server\nto get your Internet connection,\n\n1547\n01:14:01,985 --> 01:14:04,025\nwe might need to put\nsome information there.\n\n1548\n01:14:04,025 --> 01:14:06,045\n>> Custom actions.\n\n1549\n01:14:06,045 --> 01:14:08,215\n>> Yeah, I mean we're not\ngonna add any custom actions.\n\n1550\n01:14:08,215 --> 01:14:10,755\nYou'll see that we'll\nskip 90% of the screens.\n\n1551\n01:14:10,755 --> 01:14:12,055\nI mean, we really will.\n\n1552\n01:14:12,055 --> 01:14:14,685\nIf you wanted to change\nthe cool logo that was there.\n\n1553\n01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:17,330\nFor corporate branding though,\nthis is really cool.\n\n1554\n01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:21,510\nThe fact that it's so easy for\nme to throw my ITProTV\n\n1555\n01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:26,030\nlogo right there and really put\nthat corporate branding in there.\n\n1556\n01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,200\nWe'll skip past it.\n\n1557\n01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,340\nI like the globe icon.\n\n1558\n01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,238\nUnless you've got one you wanna use?\n\n1559\n01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:32,113\n>> Well, I just thought of something.\n\n1560\n01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:35,600\nI do have the PNY grabs\ngraphic that we could use.\n\n1561\n01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,050\nBut there is a size limitation and\nI did not size it prior to this.\n\n1562\n01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:41,290\nOtherwise, that would've been pretty cool.\n\n1563\n01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,310\n>> Yeah, that would've been kinda neat.\n\n1564\n01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:43,220\n>> I should have thought.\n\n1565\n01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:44,071\nWell, it happens.\n\n1566\n01:14:44,071 --> 01:14:44,880\n>> So we'll click Next.\n\n1567\n01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,070\nAgain, the default graphic for the phone\nbook when they're looking at that,\n\n1568\n01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:51,150\neveryone down the side of\nthe page we're gonna skip.\n\n1569\n01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,890\nThe icons,\nif we wanted to change that, again,\n\n1570\n01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,550\njust another chance to\ndo corporate branding.\n\n1571\n01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:57,050\nNext.\n\n1572\n01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:58,910\n>> Custom help file?\n\n1573\n01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:01,600\n>> Custom help file, this is what I\nwas telling you guys about, where\n\n1574\n01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,060\nif they click on that little question\nmark up next to their Close button,\n\n1575\n01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:10,355\nI can have a custom file that says,\nhere's Nate's cell phone, home phone.\n\n1576\n01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:11,315\nHere's his address.\n\n1577\n01:15:11,315 --> 01:15:13,675\nGo drive over and see him.\n\n1578\n01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:14,615\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n1579\n01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:17,696\nBut we'll skip that.\n\n1580\n01:15:17,696 --> 01:15:24,045\nAgain, I can put in my own work corporate\nhelp desk phone number, we can skip that.\n\n1581\n01:15:24,045 --> 01:15:25,125\nLicense agreement?\n\n1582\n01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:31,845\nMaybe you want to pop up something that\nsays, hey, you're connecting to ITPro.TV.\n\n1583\n01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,110\nAll traffic will be monitored.\n\n1584\n01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,970\nAll your legal type,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n1585\n01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,480\nDisclaimers that I need to put out there.\n\n1586\n01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:45,716\nAnd a lot of people say, whatever, you\nreally should in a corporate environment\n\n1587\n01:15:45,716 --> 01:15:48,405\nbecause even if the user doesn't read it,\nright?\n\n1588\n01:15:48,405 --> 01:15:52,610\nI've put it up there, and\nnow I've got legal means.\n\n1589\n01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:55,730\nI can say they can't tell me that\nthey didn't know that this was for\n\n1590\n01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:58,310\ncorporate use only because\nthat thing popped up.\n\n1591\n01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:59,910\nThey might have clicked OK.\n\n1592\n01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:00,570\n>> Busted.\n\n1593\n01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:04,760\n>> Yeah, so that's where you'd put all\nyour disclaimers and things like that.\n\n1594\n01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,800\nBut we'll skip it and we'll click Next.\n\n1595\n01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,030\n>> Install.\n>> Additional

--> 01:16:21,238\nit would package it up with this thing,\nand could bring it right along with.\n\n1599\n01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:22,071\nYeah, there we go.\n\n1600\n01:16:22,071 --> 01:16:22,739\n>> Sweet.\n\n1601\n01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:26,821\n>> And I think we're pretty good there.\n\n1602\n01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:30,860\nNow there should be, I wanna make sure\nwe point out, so don't go too fast here.\n\n1603\n01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:34,200\nWe'll click Next, we're not doing\nany advanced configuration.\n\n1604\n01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,420\nNow take a look at this path, guys.\n\n1605\n01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,830\nThis is a good exam question.\n\n1606\n01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:42,280\nWhere it's going to\ncreate this executable.\n\n1607\n01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:47,740\nIt's gonna be C:\\Program\nFile\\CMAC\\Profiles\\ Windows Vista and\n\n1608\n01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,320\nabove.\n\n1609\n01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,905\nAnd then if we keep going just a little\nfurther over in that path there.\n\n1610\n01:16:55,488 --> 01:16:58,074\nAnd then it should be\nthe name of whatever, yeah,\n\n1611\n01:16:58,074 --> 01:17:01,700\nnetwork is what you called it in\nthe first screen on the wizard.\n\n1612\n01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,363\nAnd then there's Network.exe.\n\n1613\n01:17:03,363 --> 01:17:05,720\nSo when you click Finish,\nit's gonna generate this file.\n\n1614\n01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:11,960\nSo we'll click Finish there.\n\n1615\n01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:18,700\nAnd now we should be able to go in to see,\n:Program Files > C-Mac > Profiles.\n\n1616\n01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,090\nVista and above.\n\n1617\n01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:20,850\n>> Network.\n\n1618\n01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:22,071\n>> Network.\n\n1619\n01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:23,822\nAnd then there's a whole bunch of files.\n\n1620\n01:17:23,822 --> 01:17:26,471\nSo what you do,\nis you give the user the folder,\n\n1621\n01:17:26,471 --> 01:17:28,670\nnot an individual file out of here.\n\n1622\n01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:30,992\nRight?\nSo I would take that entire folder,\n\n1623\n01:17:30,992 --> 01:17:35,270\ncalled Network in this case, and I would\nput that on a thumb drive or a CD-ROM.\n\n1624\n01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:39,090\nAnd then I would distribute that to my\nusers and then they would take that and\n\n1625\n01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:41,920\nthey would double-click on\nthe executable inside there.\n\n1626\n01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,171\nAnd we should run it and\nit should set up our connection for us.\n\n1627\n01:17:46,171 --> 01:17:48,080\n>> For use only.\n\n1628\n01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,438\n>> Okay.\n>> And you want a shortcut on the desktop?\n\n1629\n01:17:50,438 --> 01:17:52,322\n>> Put a shortcut on the desktop,\nabsolutely.\n\n1630\n01:17:52,322 --> 01:17:53,572\n>> There we go, oh yeah, cool.\n\n1631\n01:17:53,572 --> 01:17:54,905\n>> And there it is.\n>> Look at this neat thing.\n\n1632\n01:17:54,905 --> 01:17:59,481\n>> Yeah, and there's the graphic, that's\nwhere we could've had our own custom logo\n\n1633\n01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:02,071\nthere, you've got the icon\nin the top corner.\n\n1634\n01:18:02,071 --> 01:18:05,747\nYeah, you get the Help button in there,\nI guess they have changed that.\n\n1635\n01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,446\nIt's not the little question mark anymore,\n\n1636\n01:18:07,446 --> 01:18:09,467\nthere's a Help button down\nat the bottom right hand.\n\n1637\n01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:14,049\nIf you clicked on that, that would be that\ncustom CHM file that we could have set, so\n\n1638\n01:18:14,049 --> 01:18:14,840\nreally cool.\n\n1639\n01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,330\nAnd like I said the biggest\nthing is that it just eliminates\n\n1640\n01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,675\na lot of calls to the help desk.\n\n1641\n01:18:18,675 --> 01:18:20,440\nThat's really what this is all about.\n\n1642\n01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:25,572\nMy end users shouldn't be expected to\nbe able to pick between EAP-TLS and\n\n1643\n01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:28,738\nEAP MS-CHAP V2, and all this other stuff.\n\n1644\n01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:30,571\nI shouldn't expect them\nto be able to do that.\n\n1645\n01:18:30,571 --> 01:18:34,788\nI mean, even though I've given\nthem step by step instructions and\n\n1646\n01:18:34,788 --> 01:18:36,880\nit's in big font, but no.\n\n1647\n01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,620\nThis way, we can run through this wizard.\n\n1648\n01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,590\nWe can generate that.\n\n1649\n01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,050\nAnd I just distribute it to them.\n\n1650\n01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,660\nI can make it part of my image, so\n\n1651\n01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,520\nthat it's on all the new\nimages that I push out.\n\n1652\n01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,480\nI can put it in a share and say look,\nanybody wants it, just download it or\n\n1653\n01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,400\ncopy it down from the share.\n\n1654\n01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,020\nSo really easy to distribute and\nit just like I said,\n\n1655\n01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:57,090\neliminates a lot of the help desk calls,\nwhich is what we're always about.\n\n1656\n01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:58,863\nJust trying to make sure that it works.\n\n1657\n01:18:58,863 --> 01:19:03,422\n>> Yeah, and it does seem that\na lot of times that the name of\n\n1658\n01:19:03,422 --> 01:19:08,571\nthe game is to do many things as\nquickly and easily as possible.\n\n1659\n01:19:08,571 --> 01:19:12,295\nAnd if your task is to help\npeople connect to a VPN,\n\n1660\n01:19:12,295 --> 01:19:17,081\nor to do something related to it,\nthen a tool to help you do a lot of\n\n1661\n01:19:17,081 --> 01:19:21,250\nthings very easily with\nthe least amount of effort.\n\n1662\n01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,050\n>> That's a key phrase right there.\n\n1663\n01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,920\nYou'll see that on the exam quite often.\n\n1664\n01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,730\nAt the end of the question it says,\nwith the least administrative effort.\n\n1665\n01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:33,610\nCuz you might have two options\nthat will work, right?\n\n1666\n01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:36,640\nOne of them's gonna mean touching\nevery single machine out there.\n\n1667\n01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,450\nLike setting up a VPN connection\nmanually on one laptop at a time.\n\n1668\n01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:44,490\nOr the other answer to\nthe question is use CMAK and\n\n1669\n01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:47,490\nyou do it once, and\nthen you just have to distribute that.\n\n1670\n01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:48,840\nThat's gonna be the one you want, right?\n\n1671\n01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,290\nSo you always wanna go with that\nleast administrative effort.\n\n1672\n01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:53,810\nFor sure, for sure.\n\n1673\n01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:58,088\n>> All right, we're right up on our break\nhere, so we'll go and cut to break.\n\n1674\n01:19:58,088 --> 01:19:58,588\n>> Okay.\n>> All right?\n\n1675\n01:19:58,588 --> 01:20:01,757\nI guess the last little thing that we do\n\n1676\n01:20:01,757 --> 01:20:07,527\nhave to talk about is.\nThe remote assistance.\n\n1677\n01:20:07,527 --> 01:20:08,278\n>> Remote assistance?\n\n1678\n01:20:08,278 --> 01:20:10,952\n>> Remote assistance will do that right\n\n1679\n01:20:10,952 --> 01:20:12,530\nquick.\n\n1680\n01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:15,200\nThat should round everything up.\n\n1681\n01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,380\nOh, and then the mobile broadband.\n\n1682\n01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,640\n>> Mobile broadband, another one.\n\n1683\n01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,890\nAnd VP reconnect.\n\n1684\n01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,300\n>> Direct.\n>> Oh, direct access!\n\n1685\n01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,350\nWow.\n>> Yeah, there's a few things.\n\n1686\n01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:29,540\nThis is going to wrap\ninto a second episode.\n\n1687\n01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:31,655\nThis is going to be another\none of those two parters for\n\n1688\n01:20:31,655 --> 01:20:33,610\nyou guys out there, I think.\n\n1689\n01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:36,200\nWe'll come back in a few, and\nwe'll get as much as we can done, and\n\n1690\n01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,263\nwe'll see where we go from there.\n\n1691\n01:20:38,263 --> 01:20:38,962\n>> Sweet.\n\n1692\n01:20:38,962 --> 01:20:40,081\nAll right.\n\n1693\n01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:41,899\nAfter the break.\n\n1694\n01:20:41,899 --> 01:20:49,300\n[SOUND] All right and welcome back.\n\n1695\n01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:54,230\nSo, we've got a couple things\nto wrap up in this episode.\n\n1696\n01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:56,110\nYup.\nFirst off we have,\n\n1697\n01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:59,560\nnow we did talk about\ndirect access briefly,\n\n1698\n01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:04,200\nwhich is like a VPN on steroids,\nso it's really cool.\n\n1699\n01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:08,250\nAs soon as the computer boots up,\nthe VPN is there and connected.\n\n1700\n01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,700\n>> Now, careful with the terminology.\n\n1701\n01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,150\nYou know how I'm a stickler for\nmy names and acronyms.\n\n1702\n01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,490\nSo direct access is not VPN.\n\n1703\n01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,340\nVPN is virtual private network.\n\n1704\n01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,830\nDirect access.\n\n1705\n01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:22,860\nDifferent type of remote\naccess protocol altogether.\n\n1706\n01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,700\nBut it's a big topic.\n\n1707\n01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,220\nRight?\nI mean,\n\n1708\n01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,030\nthere's a lot of stuff we got\nto talk about with that, so\n\n1709\n01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:31,130\nthat I think will just break out into,\nit's going to be its own episode.\n\n1710\n01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:36,700\nSo we can definitely do that, we can\ncover direct access, fantastic, so sweet.\n\n1711\n01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:38,162\nAs Nate was saying.\n\n1712\n01:21:38,162 --> 01:21:42,040\nIt is a remote access protocol\nthat occurs automatically\n\n1713\n01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,570\nin the background\ntransparent to the end user.\n\n1714\n01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:46,220\nTune in for that episode.\n\n1715\n01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:50,030\nThat's going to be a lot of fun.\n\n1716\n01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:55,470\n>> I believe the 70,\n688 covers direct access as well.\n\n1717\n01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:57,500\n>> Okay, am I covering that one as well?\n\n1718\n01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,210\nYeah.\n\n1719\n01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:59,090\n>> Good deal.\n\n1720\n01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:05,140\nSo really we talk about a VPN,\nwe need to mention, what did we leave out?\n\n1721\n01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:06,060\nVPN reconnects?\n\n1722\n01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,880\n>> VPN reconnect, yeah.\n\n1723\n01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:11,280\nVPN reconnect, we did talk about\nit earlier in our episode today.\n\n1724\n01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:11,850\n>> Oh, that's right.\n\n1725\n01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:13,170\n>> And yeah.\n>> Cause we talked about\n\n1726\n01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,750\nthe train going through the tunnel, right.\n\n1727\n01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:18,160\n>> The train and then how we can\nroam between different hot spots.\n\n1728\n01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:24,020\nAnd the the big thing with VP reconnect,\nis that it requires the IKE V2.\n\n1729\n01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:25,980\nIt has to have it.\n\n1730\n01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:30,810\nAnd IKE V2 requires PKI certificates.\n\n1731\n01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:35,090\nThey can use public CA's or\n\n1732\n01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:39,830\nit can use internal CA's It just\nneeds that component there and\n\n1733\n01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:43,470\nthat's just like the big\nthing with a reconnect.\n\n1734\n01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:46,420\n>> Yeah, I mean you'll see in larger\nenvironments they're going to already\n\n1735\n01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,170\nhave public infrastructure set up, so\nthey're going to be having issues or\n\n1736\n01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:51,570\nthey're going to issue\ncertificates on users' computers.\n\n1737\n01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:55,250\nSo it's just a matter of going in and\nsetting up your VPN server for support.\n\n1738\n01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,670\nIKE V2 and choosing that protocol.\n\n1739\n01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:00,750\nSmaller environments might not have that\npublic key infrastructure set up, so\n\n1740\n01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,620\nthis might not be an option.\n\n1741\n01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:04,710\nBut as we were saying earlier,\nit is the default.\n\n1742\n01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:07,720\nIt is the one they will try first\nbecause of those cool features,\n\n1743\n01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,570\nbecause of that VPN reconnect.\n\n1744\n01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:10,810\nThat's fantastic.\n\n1745\n01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:13,930\nThat's really what we need\nto know about it, I think,\n\n1746\n01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,650\nthat it's on the IKEv2 protocol.\n\n1747\n01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:19,560\nThat it is going to give\nus that transparent or\n\n1748\n01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,580\nseemless switching between access points.\n\n1749\n01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:27,330\nOr when we lose our connection, it's going\nto automatically reconnect that connection\n\n1750\n01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:29,850\nwithout us having to do anything.\n\n1751\n01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:33,580\nAnd that it does require certificates\nwhich we're going to have to have\n\n1752\n01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,140\npublicly in the infrastructure.\n\n1753\n01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,410\nOr we could purchase certificates.\n\n1754\n01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:38,920\nI mean, as Nate was saying,\nwe could buy certificates\n\n1755\n01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,998\nfrom a public CA instead of running\nour own certificate authority.\n\n1756\n01:23:42,998 --> 01:23:45,950\nJust going to cost you a little\nmore money and things like that.\n\n1757\n01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:49,036\nBut still a valid option, so\nyeah, that's VPN reconnect.\n\n1758\n01:23:49,036 --> 01:23:49,884\n>> Yep.\n\n1759\n01:23:49,884 --> 01:23:56,260\nAnd so we've, the last little,\nwell second to last, right?\n\n1760\n01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:59,610\nAbout managing mobile broadband.\n\n1761\n01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:01,250\n>> Yeah.\nBroadband connections.\n\n1762\n01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:06,170\n>> And before, a few episodes\nprior when we're talking about.\n\n1763\n01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:08,850\nWireless connections,\nmanaging wireless connections.\n\n1764\n01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:12,520\nWe did talk a bit about\nmobile broadband cards.\n\n1765\n01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:20,370\nYeah, like air cards from Verizon\ncomes to mind right away.\n\n1766\n01:24:20,370 --> 01:24:24,590\nAnd just an air card, little card,\nplug in and you get wireless.\n\n1767\n01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:25,508\nCan you hear me now?\n\n1768\n01:24:25,508 --> 01:24:31,290\n>> Internet and that's a really,\nand you know, as far\n\n1769\n01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:37,050\ncredentials and signing in, that would\nall be by the provider of the air card.\n\n1770\n01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:39,448\n>> Yeah.\nWhat we need to know for the exam for\n\n1771\n01:24:39,448 --> 01:24:43,267\nthis guy is one, that mobile broadband,\nas Nate pointed out,\n\n1772\n01:24:43,267 --> 01:24:47,663\nwe're talking about now taking like\nan air card or something like that,\n\n1773\n01:24:47,663 --> 01:24:52,275\nslipping it into my laptop, and\nbeing able to connect and get, hopefully,\n\n1774\n01:24:52,275 --> 01:24:55,370\nhigh speed connections\nover the cell network.\n\n1775\n01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:56,560\nRight.\n\n1776\n01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,880\nSo when I'm not in range of a hotspot, or\nsomething like that, I could still connect\n\n1777\n01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,460\nand get better speeds, than I would say,\non dial up, or something like that.\n\n1778\n01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:07,000\nWhat we need to know for\nthis, is that Windows 8,\n\n1779\n01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,290\nswitched over to a driver based model for\nthe mobile broadband card.\n\n1780\n01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:16,420\nWhen mobile broadband cards were\nstill new, it was difficult because\n\n1781\n01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:21,200\nyour users would have different\nvendors mobile broadband cards.\n\n1782\n01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,620\nOne user lives in this area and\n\n1783\n01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:26,150\nthey've gone with AT&T as\ntheir cell phone provider.\n\n1784\n01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:29,950\nYou've got another person who has Verizon\nas their cell phone provider or whatever,\n\n1785\n01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:32,810\nso they've got these different cards,\nand they all had, huh?\n\n1786\n01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:34,540\n>> Sorry.\nI was going to say, and\n\n1787\n01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,550\nyour one guy who has Sprint,\nright, he always has problems.\n\n1788\n01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:37,110\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1789\n01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:37,671\n>> All day, long.\n\n1790\n01:25:37,671 --> 01:25:38,174\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1791\n01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:39,487\n>> That's why I didn't mention those guys.\n\n1792\n01:25:39,487 --> 01:25:40,029\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, man.\n\n1793\n01:25:40,029 --> 01:25:41,000\n>> T-Mobile. No. >> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1794\n01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,776\n>> Not anything bad around T-Mobile.\n\n1795\n01:25:43,776 --> 01:25:46,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> T-Mobile's fine.\n\n1796\n01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,680\nSo, the configuring of these cards was\na pain, because it was different for\n\n1797\n01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,750\neach one of them.\n\n1798\n01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,350\nI had to know how do I set\nup this AT&T broadband card.\n\n1799\n01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:56,080\nHow do I set up this branch or\nthis T-Mobile, this Verizon or\n\n1800\n01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,440\nwhatever, broadband card now.\n\n1801\n01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,230\nWindows 8 has a driver based model so\n\n1802\n01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:04,230\nwhen we pop those cards in, we got\na Windows interface that we can use that's\n\n1803\n01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:07,210\ngoing to be consistent across\nall the different vendors.\n\n1804\n01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:09,110\nAnd that's all we need to know for\nthis exam.\n\n1805\n01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,970\nBecause, as we said, the settings,\n\n1806\n01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:15,750\nthe stuff like that, all of that is going\nto be very dependent on your provider.\n\n1807\n01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,890\nThe options that you have to configure\nto be able to connect to their network.\n\n1808\n01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:22,570\nJust understand that now you've got\na simple interface to manage all of your\n\n1809\n01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:23,830\nbroadband devices.\n\n1810\n01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:27,866\nNo matter what vendor it is, and\nthen that's all you need after that.\n\n1811\n01:26:27,866 --> 01:26:28,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1812\n01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,590\nYep.\nSo the last little thing,\n\n1813\n01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:33,680\nwhich is pretty pretty cool\n>> It is cool.\n\n1814\n01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,360\n>> The remote assistance.\n\n1815\n01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:41,764\nAnd it allows a user who has\na problem to create an invitation.\n\n1816\n01:26:41,764 --> 01:26:43,510\n>> Mh-hm.\n>> And send it to somebody.\n\n1817\n01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,487\nOr put it in a file share somewhere.\n\n1818\n01:26:45,487 --> 01:26:46,120\n>> Yep\n>> And\n\n1819\n01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,230\nanother person can grab that invitation.\n\n1820\n01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,170\nRun it.\nYou need a password.\n\n1821\n01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:51,720\nAnd the computers will connect.\n\n1822\n01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:52,600\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n1823\n01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:57,950\n>> And the guy, the helper, right,\ncan either take control of it or\n\n1824\n01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,778\njust kinda coach through\nthis cool little chat thing.\n\n1825\n01:26:59,778 --> 01:27:00,662\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1826\n01:27:00,662 --> 01:27:02,390\n>> And neat stuff.\n\n1827\n01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:03,560\n>> It is.\nIt's really cool.\n\n1828\n01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,815\nI've used this several times.\n\n1829\n01:27:05,815 --> 01:27:07,135\nWith my parents.\n\n1830\n01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:09,835\nMy mother is down in the Tampa area.\n\n1831\n01:27:09,835 --> 01:27:11,945\nI'm up here in Gainesville.\n\n1832\n01:27:11,945 --> 01:27:14,905\nAnd if she has a problem on her computer,\nhow do I help her fix it?\n\n1833\n01:27:14,905 --> 01:27:18,040\nI mean, I can try to do the whole\nphone thing and walk her through it.\n\n1834\n01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:22,460\nWith remote assistance, we can open up,\nI can share her connection.\n\n1835\n01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:24,980\nUnlike remote desktop,\nwhich is a valid option.\n\n1836\n01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:30,070\nI can use remote desktop to fix somebody's\ncomputer, but then they're knocked out.\n\n1837\n01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:33,390\nRemote desktop means I'm going\nto take over that machine,\n\n1838\n01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:35,315\nall they're going to see on\ntheir end is a lock screen.\n\n1839\n01:27:35,315 --> 01:27:37,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They can't see what I'm doing.\n\n1840\n01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:41,150\nAnd I can't use it as an opportunity\nto teach them how not to do this again.\n\n1841\n01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:43,690\nOr show them what went wrong and\nwhy it happened and\n\n1842\n01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:45,020\nhow to prevent that in the future.\n\n1843\n01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,860\n>> Or have them show you what it is\nthat they do that gives the problem.\n\n1844\n01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:48,470\n>> Exactly.\n\n1845\n01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:49,560\nHow to recreate that thing.\n\n1846\n01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,859\nVery good.\nSo with remote assistance.\n\n1847\n01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,852\nIt's a shared connection, so\nI can see it's a glorified chat program,\n\n1848\n01:27:55,852 --> 01:27:57,227\nis what it comes down to.\n\n1849\n01:27:57,227 --> 01:27:58,613\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's really cool,\n\n1850\n01:27:58,613 --> 01:28:02,315\na lot of the vendors use it or\nsome kind of offshoot of it.\n\n1851\n01:28:02,315 --> 01:28:05,133\nLike when you look at Dell and you can\nClick on that little thing that says,\n\n1852\n01:28:05,133 --> 01:28:06,684\ncan I give you or do you need assistance.\n\n1853\n01:28:06,684 --> 01:28:11,612\nIt's a program very similar to remote\nassistance, where you're gonna have,\n\n1854\n01:28:11,612 --> 01:28:16,320\nif Nate is the one that needs help,\nhe is gonna send me an invitation.\n\n1855\n01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,050\nI'm going to accept that invitation.\n\n1856\n01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:20,380\nHe should password protect it, as he said.\n\n1857\n01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:23,460\nAnd then I'm gonna see\nhis screen in a window.\n\n1858\n01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:24,500\nYeah, let's do it.\n\n1859\n01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,084\nLet's just do it.\n\n1860\n01:28:25,084 --> 01:28:27,423\nI'm sitting here talking about it.\n\n1861\n01:28:27,423 --> 01:28:28,648\nWe have the technology.\n\n1862\n01:28:28,648 --> 01:28:29,199\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1863\n01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:30,000\nAll right.\n\n1864\n01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,700\nSo what we're gonna do,\n\n1865\n01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:36,860\nis we're gonna have Mike be the distressed\nperson who can't work a computer.\n\n1866\n01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:38,130\n>> I don't understand.\n\n1867\n01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:42,020\n>> And then,\nI will be the helper and connect.\n\n1868\n01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,310\nRight?\nOh,\n\n1869\n01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:48,490\nwe're getting hand signals that Mike's,\noh yeah, Mike's.\n\n1870\n01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,480\n>> Oh, we've lost my IVG.\n\n1871\n01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:50,560\nOkay, let me reconnect there.\n\n1872\n01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,470\nWhat do you want me on, one?\n\n1873\n01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:57,510\n>> Yeah.\n>> I have blue lines again.\n\n1874\n01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:59,563\nNo I don't, I died.\n\n1875\n01:28:59,563 --> 01:29:01,313\n>> All right, try it again.\n\n1876\n01:29:07,814 --> 01:29:12,773\nMan, and we were just messing with this\nduring the break to get all set up and\n\n1877\n01:29:12,773 --> 01:29:14,440\nit was just working and.\n\n1878\n01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,355\n>> I have lost my connection altogether.\n\n1879\n01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:17,401\n>> Oh, man.\n\n1880\n01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:18,856\n>> I've got, let's just double check here.\n\n1881\n01:29:18,856 --> 01:29:19,605\nCan't load, yeah.\n\n1882\n01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:21,646\nI have dropped.\n\n1883\n01:29:21,646 --> 01:29:24,160\n>> And you still have internet connection.\n\n1884\n01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,700\n>> Well that's what I'm\ntrying to see right now.\n\n1885\n01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:32,980\nLet's just see if my little XPS here\nmight have, there we go, now we're back.\n\n1886\n01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:37,271\nSo let's try, we'll try one.\n\n1887\n01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:40,230\n>> Anything?\n\n1888\n01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:43,500\n>> Yep, there we go.\n\n1889\n01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,040\nWe are back in business.\n\n1890\n01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:45,810\n>> All right.\nWhew.\n\n1891\n01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:47,778\n>> I know.\nThat would have been a crazy, boring demo.\n\n1892\n01:29:47,778 --> 01:29:49,889\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If we could not have seen that.\n\n1893\n01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:55,690\nSet us up again, I'm the guy that needs\nhelp, I've done something to my computer.\n\n1894\n01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:57,830\n>> You don't know how to use a computer,\nand\n\n1895\n01:29:57,830 --> 01:30:00,730\nyou need help, and\nI will be your saving guy to help.\n\n1896\n01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:04,030\nWhat is this a compu, ter?\n\n1897\n01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:05,050\n>> Mike that's crazy.\n\n1898\n01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,320\n>> Oh, not that stupid?\n\n1899\n01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:06,898\nAll right.\n\n1900\n01:30:06,898 --> 01:30:11,170\n[LAUGH] Because I've got to know how\nto create the invitation, right?\n\n1901\n01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:11,872\n>> That's right.\n\n1902\n01:30:11,872 --> 01:30:13,410\nYou do need.\n\n1903\n01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,120\nSo first things first.\n\n1904\n01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:21,120\nFrom the Start screen we can\njust type in assistance.\n\n1905\n01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,420\n>> Pick me up on tri-caster\none if I'm still showing.\n\n1906\n01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,280\n>> Hopefully.\n\n1907\n01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,940\n>> Hopefully, fingers crossed.\n\n1908\n01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:26,760\nThere we are.\n\n1909\n01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,389\nWe're gonna do some remote.\n\n1910\n01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,330\nThat what you want me to

guess.\n\n1914\n01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:40,350\n>> Yeah, it'll take me to that screen.\n\n1915\n01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:41,020\n>> Yep.\n\n1916\n01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:44,680\nAnd sweet, we got it.\n\n1917\n01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,690\nLet's go back to your start screen.\n\n1918\n01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:50,800\nAnd just start typing in assistance.\n\n1919\n01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,988\nEven just do part of it.\n\n1920\n01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,477\nYou're on 8.1.\n\n1921\n01:30:54,477 --> 01:30:55,472\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1922\n01:30:55,472 --> 01:30:56,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1923\n01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:57,468\n>> What do I need?\n\n1924\n01:30:57,468 --> 01:30:59,844\nHelp and Support?\n\n1925\n01:30:59,844 --> 01:31:01,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1926\n01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:01,860\nYeah, help and support.\n\n1927\n01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:07,200\n>> And, then we're gonna go to,\ncontact support?\n\n1928\n01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:07,771\nWhat do we do.\n\n1929\n01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:09,646\nI'm lost, I don't understand.\n\n1930\n01:31:09,646 --> 01:31:11,646\n>> This 8.1, 8.1.\n\n1931\n01:31:19,188 --> 01:31:23,188\nAll right, yeah,\nWindows Remote Assistance.\n\n1932\n01:31:23,188 --> 01:31:26,480\nThat's what we need.\n\n1933\n01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,480\n>> I can't type.\n\n1934\n01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:34,356\n>> [LAUGH] So we get the option to allow,\nI wonder if 8.1 did something.\n\n1935\n01:31:34,356 --> 01:31:41,040\nIt's like completely derailed my\nentire little demo here of stuff.\n\n1936\n01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,220\nWhile Mike looks for\nthe invitation process,\n\n1937\n01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:47,813\nlet's switch over to mine\nwhere I have it pulled up.\n\n1938\n01:31:47,813 --> 01:31:52,044\nAnd for the Remote Assistance,\nright, and okay, so\n\n1939\n01:31:52,044 --> 01:31:55,617\nfor Windows 8,\nI get into my Start screen and\n\n1940\n01:31:55,617 --> 01:31:58,271\njust start typing assistance\n>> There we go\n\n1941\n01:31:58,271 --> 01:31:59,938\n>> And in Setting.\n\n1942\n01:31:59,938 --> 01:32:00,730\n>> I got you covered now.\n\n1943\n01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,125\n>> Oh, all right well, jump back to Mike.\n\n1944\n01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:04,280\n>> Okay\n>> All right.\n\n1945\n01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,700\n>> I know, yeah.\n\n1946\n01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:06,360\n>> All right, and for\n\n1947\n01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,510\nyou guys out there at home let me\nshow you what I ended up doing there.\n\n1948\n01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:14,820\nWith Windows 8.1, you guys know we can\njust start typing and find things.\n\n1949\n01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,270\nNow I can't remember what I typed to find.\n\n1950\n01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:23,820\nI did send invitation.\n\n1951\n01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,350\nThere, I got Allow Remote Assistance.\n\n1952\n01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:32,250\nInvite somebody,\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n1953\n01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:36,940\nInvite someone to connect to your PC and\noffer you help.\n\n1954\n01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:38,810\nSo that pulls up that screen.\n\n1955\n01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:41,350\nSo the shortest way to get there would be,\n\n1956\n01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:44,867\nmaybe type invite,\nlooks like what they've, yes.\n\n1957\n01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:49,850\nDo I dare say it on live TV?\n\n1958\n01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:54,330\nI wonder why with Microsoft search engine\ncapabilities, why do we still use Google?\n\n1959\n01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,530\nAnyway.\n>> Moving right along.\n\n1960\n01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,320\nSo we have two options here.\n\n1961\n01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:01,025\nWe have invite someone to help,\n\n1962\n01:33:01,025 --> 01:33:05,570\ninvite someone you trust to help you or\nhelp someone who has invited.\n\n1963\n01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:09,120\nSo, for this process,\nwe are going to choose the top one.\n\n1964\n01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,850\n>> Okay.\n>> All right, and\n\n1965\n01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:13,845\nwe will save the invitation as a file.\n\n1966\n01:33:13,845 --> 01:33:17,190\n>> Mm-hm, and we could, a couple of\nthings I wanna point out as we're going.\n\n1967\n01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:21,040\nOne, remote assistance is enabled by\ndefault, on your Windows operating system,\n\n1968\n01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:24,780\nRemote Desktop is not remote\nassistance enabled by default.\n\n1969\n01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:28,740\nSo I'm gonna go in and create this file,\nI'm gonna give it a name.\n\n1970\n01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:33,100\nI'm gonna call it help me Nate.\n\n1971\n01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,400\n>> And let's save it to your desktop.\n\n1972\n01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,280\n>> And I'll put it on my desktop so\nwe can find it nice and easy.\n\n1973\n01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,120\n>> Yep.\n\n1974\n01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,490\nAnd now keep this window open.\n\n1975\n01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:42,250\n>> Okay.\n>> All right.\n\n1976\n01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:45,940\nSo let's just create a shared\nfolder on your desktop and\n\n1977\n01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:48,250\njust dump that in there so\nI can grab it off your machine.\n\n1978\n01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,640\n>> Or you can use my administrative share.\n\n1979\n01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:51,740\n>> Administrative share?\n\n1980\n01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:55,266\n>> Yes.\nAll right, I'll tell you what here,\n\n1981\n01:33:55,266 --> 01:33:56,021\nlet me.\n\n1982\n01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:05,503\nCreate a folder called Invites and\nI will share that with everyone,\n\n1983\n01:34:05,503 --> 01:34:09,240\nwhich is definitely not a good way to go,\nright?\n\n1984\n01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,620\n>> Well.\n>> But for\n\n1985\n01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:14,130\nthis lab example,\nwe're just gonna use the easy way here.\n\n1986\n01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,622\nI'll give you at least read permission.\n\n1987\n01:34:16,622 --> 01:34:17,771\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1988\n01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:21,590\nNice.\n\n1989\n01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:22,550\nThank you Mike.\n>> All right.\n\n1990\n01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:23,450\nThere you go.\n\n1991\n01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:27,470\nNow normally as Nate connects over here to\nmy machine, in the real world obviously,\n\n1992\n01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:29,930\nit probably wouldn't have\nan easy connection like this,\n\n1993\n01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:30,630\nwhere I could share that.\n\n1994\n01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:33,680\nLike my mother for example,\ndown in the Tampa area.\n\n1995\n01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:39,120\nShe sends me the invite via mail, or\nvia email, it can also be sent via chat.\n\n1996\n01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:45,090\nAny way that you can distribute a file,\nwill work for this.\n\n1997\n01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:50,650\nBut usually instant messaging or,\nokay, don't see it.\n\n1998\n01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:52,450\nAll right go to my C Drive.\n\n1999\n01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:55,350\nI'm just going to put it\non the root over here.\n\n2000\n01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:56,772\nDo your little C dollar sign.\n\n2001\n01:34:59,146 --> 01:35:00,185\nShould be able to get there, right?\n\n2002\n01:35:00,185 --> 01:35:00,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2003\n01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:09,020\n>> Or we can put it in your profile.\n\n2004\n01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:10,060\n>> Oh, can you connect to mine?\n\n2005\n01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:10,730\n>> Probably.\n\n2006\n01:35:15,021 --> 01:35:16,313\nI'll put it in both.\n\n2007\n01:35:22,105 --> 01:35:23,910\nI cannot write to your location.\n\n2008\n01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:28,300\nSo why don't you just connect over to my,\ncan you not connect to my C Drive?\n\n2009\n01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,250\n>> I can get into my\nfolder that you created.\n\n2010\n01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:30,750\nThe Nate folder.\n\n2011\n01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:33,355\nCan you dump it in there?\n\n2012\n01:35:33,355 --> 01:35:33,938\n>> No.\n\n2013\n01:35:33,938 --> 01:35:35,210\n>> Really?\n\n2014\n01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:36,030\n>> I can if I go and\n\n2015\n01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:38,710\ngive myself permissions over\nthe Nate folder, let's see.\n\n2016\n01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:39,880\n>> Actually, it's on your desktop.\n\n2017\n01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,430\nOh wait, I just, okay yeah, all right.\n\n2018\n01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:42,947\nNow it says it's empty.\n\n2019\n01:35:42,947 --> 01:35:44,480\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Hold on.\n\n2020\n01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:48,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Good golly.\n\n2021\n01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,250\n>> I know.\nJust to get an invite is like,\n\n2022\n01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,515\nfirst of all, your user needs.\n\n2023\n01:35:52,515 --> 01:35:53,330\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n2024\n01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:54,680\nI'm just gonna copy that this time.\n\n2025\n01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:58,695\n>> Could have like a network share or\nsomething in a big place, rather than.\n\n2026\n01:35:58,695 --> 01:35:59,549\n>> Help me Nate.\n\n2027\n01:35:59,549 --> 01:36:00,809\n>> Okay, I got it.\n\n2028\n01:36:00,809 --> 01:36:02,110\nOkay, whoo.\n\n2029\n01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:03,836\nAll right, so let's jump over to mine.\n\n2030\n01:36:03,836 --> 01:36:11,219\nAl lright and I will double click on we'll\njust close it out there is the file right?\n\n2031\n01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:12,770\n>> Mm hm\n>> Double click on this file,\n\n2032\n01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:17,910\nher we go and now I need that\npassword that was on Mike's screen\n\n2033\n01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:18,840\n>> Okay.\n\n2034\n01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:23,310\n>> So, I would be calling you up and\ngiving you that,\n\n2035\n01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:28,207\nand we're gonna say, lima,\nfoxtrot, kilo, mike,\n\n2036\n01:36:28,207 --> 01:36:32,906\n4, 2, bravo, tango, kilo, 6, 7, yankee.\n\n2037\n01:36:35,195 --> 01:36:37,040\nWas there a Mike that you said in there?\n\n2038\n01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,960\n>> Yeah lima fox trot kilo mike.\n\n2039\n01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,960\nForty two, bravo, tango.\n\n2040\n01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,440\nOh, wait, somebody's trying\nto connect to my machine.\n\n2041\n01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,108\n>> Go ahead and pull me up there Mr. Sir.\n\n2042\n01:36:47,108 --> 01:36:52,980\nSo this is what you see on the invitee's\nside, or would I be the helpee?\n\n2043\n01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,540\nI would be the helpee, not the helper.\n\n2044\n01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:58,750\nSo I see that somebody's\ntrying to make a connection.\n\n2045\n01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:02,660\nThe reason why we want to show\nyou this is that it is secure.\n\n2046\n01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:06,060\nIf somebody finds my invite,\nthey can't just double click on it and\n\n2047\n01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:06,790\nconnect to my machine.\n\n2048\n01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:10,070\nThey would have to know that\npassphrase that I just called out.\n\n2049\n01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:12,920\nAnd that's going to be a separate channel,\n\n2050\n01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:17,990\nwe sent the invite via email, but\nI did the passphrase via phone.\n\n2051\n01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:19,430\nWe're keeping those on separate channels.\n\n2052\n01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:23,030\nThat way we've got less risk of\nsomebody intercepting both of those.\n\n2053\n01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:24,710\nAnd then when he does try to connect,\n\n2054\n01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:27,460\nit's still going to ask me\nif I want to allow him.\n\n2055\n01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:31,210\nAnd at this point if didn't know or\nwasn't expecting this, I could say no and\n\n2056\n01:37:31,210 --> 01:37:33,160\nhe wouldn't be able to\nconnect to my machine.\n\n2057\n01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:34,200\nBut I'll say yes.\n\n2058\n01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:38,300\n>> Where's all the fireworks?\n\n2059\n01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:39,820\n>> Not on my side, right?\n\n2060\n01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:43,950\nIt does tell me that my helper\ncan now see my desktop.\n\n2061\n01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:45,700\n>> I was just going to point that out.\n\n2062\n01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:47,890\n>> See, we're thinking alike.\n\n2063\n01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:52,270\nSo let's flip back over to your screen\nthen and see what the helper sees.\n\n2064\n01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:54,970\n>> Yup, so here we are on my screen.\n\n2065\n01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:59,150\nSo, in my remote assistance\nlittle window here.\n\n2066\n01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:00,370\nSo here's the little window.\n\n2067\n01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:02,230\nI'll just full screen it.\n\n2068\n01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:02,970\nAnd then, there!\n\n2069\n01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:06,820\nI have Mike's desktop right\nthere inside my desktop.\n\n2070\n01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:11,020\nAnd as he moves his mouse around and\nclicks and does things, let's see,\n\n2071\n01:38:11,020 --> 01:38:12,990\nI'll move my mouse out of the way.\n\n2072\n01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:16,990\nSo it is a shared connection, and you're\nseeing realtime what's going on in here.\n\n2073\n01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:21,470\nNow here's where it starts getting really\ncool, because now he can see my screen.\n\n2074\n01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:25,420\nI'm going to click Chat, and\n\n2075\n01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:31,430\nI'm going to say,\nhey Nate I need some help.\n\n2076\n01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:33,910\n>> All right.\n\n2077\n01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:34,450\nAnd so.\n\n2078\n01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,082\n>> And that font is horrible, but\nI don't think you guys can see that.\n\n2079\n01:38:36,082 --> 01:38:37,833\n>> I know.\nIt is teeny, tiny, tiny.\n\n2080\n01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:39,307\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n2081\n01:38:39,307 --> 01:38:41,290\n>> So it on my screen, right?\n\n2082\n01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:45,684\nSo the little chat program\nappears off onto the side there\n\n2083\n01:38:45,684 --> 01:38:46,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2084\n01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:54,920\nAnd so I'll reply what do\nyou need help with today?\n\n2085\n01:38:54,920 --> 01:39:01,190\n>> My Steam client has crapped out.\n\n2086\n01:39:01,190 --> 01:39:03,320\nIs that the technical description there?\n\n2087\n01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:08,940\n>> Then I will say, show me, right?\n\n2088\n01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:09,790\nShow me Mike.\n\n2089\n01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:13,970\n>> So then I'm going to double click,\nwhere is my Steam client, it's gone even.\n\n2090\n01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:16,290\nI don't even see it.\n\n2091\n01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:17,840\nThat's not Steam.\n\n2092\n01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,145\n>> Well, that's what you need, yeah.\n\n2093\n01:39:19,145 --> 01:39:20,554\nMm-hm.\n\n2094\n01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:24,470\nAnd it opened up Origin.\n\n2095\n01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:25,050\n>> All right.\n\n2096\n01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:27,200\n>> Oh no, what's wrong?\n\n2097\n01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,282\n>> Yeah, so I think all right so.\n\n2098\n01:39:29,282 --> 01:39:34,850\n[LAUGH] All right,\nhow about the steam client, okay.\n\n2099\n01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:36,810\nWell, I found the problem.\n\n2100\n01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:37,750\n>> Okay.\n\n2101\n01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:42,140\nThat you have no idea what it is that\nyou're trying to open up on your machine.\n\n2102\n01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:42,760\n>> I don't.\nI don't.\n\n2103\n01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:47,740\n>> So I can see that the password\ncredentials likely will not work, right,\n\n2104\n01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:48,860\nfor the esteemed client,\n\n2105\n01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:53,100\nand we have this other origin\nclient that you are trying to run.\n\n2106\n01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:56,310\n>> Yes.\n>> Now, I will tell my crates,\n\n2107\n01:39:56,310 --> 01:40:01,690\nI'll say\n>> Here I'll fix it.\n\n2108\n01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:06,830\nNow a cooling with remote assistance\nis let's say rather than trying to\n\n2109\n01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:11,800\nmonkey with a bunch of stuff,\nI can take control of Mike's machine.\n\n2110\n01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,340\nNow it won't log him out or anything but\n\n2111\n01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:18,250\nI will be able to manipulate his computer\n>> Yeah, so\n\n2112\n01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:22,680\nyou can instead of trying to walk\nme through through chat it might be\n\n2113\n01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,645\neasier if you just fixed it right\n>> Mm\n\n2114\n01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:28,340\nhm\n>> So I can go ahead and what's going to\n\n2115\n01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:34,020\nhappen is he can not just take control\nof my machine he can ask me for control.\n\n2116\n01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:36,580\nThis leaves the helpee in charge.\n\n2117\n01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:39,220\nAnd anytime I think he's doing\nsomething I don't want him to do,\n\n2118\n01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:42,305\nor he's getting somewhere where I've\ngot stuff that he shouldn't be seeing\n\n2119\n01:40:42,305 --> 01:40:44,900\nI can end his control,\nI can end his connection.\n\n2120\n01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:49,396\nSo the helpee is left in a feeling\nof being in charge, not helpless.\n\n2121\n01:40:49,396 --> 01:40:56,030\n[COUGH] Like [INAUDIBLE] myself,\nif I trust Nate I can,\n\n2122\n01:40:56,030 --> 01:41:02,470\nI'll let him, do I need him to be able to\nrespond to UAC prompts if they pop up?\n\n2123\n01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:05,990\nI'll go ahead and check that, and\nI'll say, Yes, let Nate take control or\n\n2124\n01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:10,960\nshare control, cause I still have\ncontrol as well, at any time I can\n\n2125\n01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,830\nclick stop sharing, I can hit my escape\nkey, and I can end Nate's control.\n\n2126\n01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:17,380\nSo at this point you should have, and\n\n2127\n01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:22,640\nI can see it in my chat little program\nthere, Nate is sharing control.\n\n2128\n01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,500\nOoh, my windows are moving, hands free.\n\n2129\n01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,090\nAll right.\nOh, that's\n\n2130\n01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:25,590\n>> That's crazy.\n\n2131\n01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:26,100\n>> That's crazy.\n\n2132\n01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:27,390\nAll right.\n\n2133\n01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:32,150\nSo I think I think what we're going to\ndo in this situation on how to fix this\n\n2134\n01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:34,740\nis we will close this out\nright because we're trying to\n\n2135\n01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:37,020\nget this user needs Steam client working.\n\n2136\n01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:38,620\n>> I need Steam.\nI don't have an Origin account.\n\n2137\n01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:45,220\n>> Now what we're going to do,\nI think the best thing is an easy command.\n\n2138\n01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:47,720\nRight and so we will type this in.\n\n2139\n01:41:50,702 --> 01:41:51,343\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n2140\n01:41:51,343 --> 01:41:55,430\nthis will fix all of my users problems.\n\n2141\n01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:57,420\n>> Are you going to shut me down or\nrestart my machine?\n\n2142\n01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,157\nOh, was I supposed to not notice that?\n\n2143\n01:42:00,157 --> 01:42:04,345\n[LAUGH] sorry I was alright,\nI'm a dumb user okay,\n\n2144\n01:42:04,345 --> 01:42:09,347\ngo ahead whatever you wanna do to\nmy computer it's fine, I trust you.\n\n2145\n01:42:09,347 --> 01:42:11,605\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so, the best thing so\n\n2146\n01:42:11,605 --> 01:42:16,400\nthat was a command just to you shut down\nand we'll restart this computer, and\n\n2147\n01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,410\njust get rid of it.\n\n2148\n01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:21,220\nIn this situation, if they can't figure\nout the right client through the remote\n\n2149\n01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:25,380\nassistance, then we will just log this\nuser out, and say problem solved.\n\n2150\n01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:26,290\n>> Tell them to pack it up.\n\n2151\n01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:27,325\n>> Yeah, pack it up.\n\n2152\n01:42:27,325 --> 01:42:29,870\n>> [LAUGH] Very good.\n\n2153\n01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:32,400\nSorry.\nI almost I tripped him up\n\n2154\n01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,490\na little bit there.\n\n2155\n01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:34,770\nI was actually watching the community,\n\n2156\n01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:39,000\nhe's not expecting the end\nuser to know that [LAUGH].\n\n2157\n01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,900\nBut remote assistance fantastic,\n\n2158\n01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:45,880\nit works over port 33 89 same port that\nwe use for mode desktop by default.\n\n2159\n01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:50,340\nYou can send an invitation, you can,\nalso in a corporate environment,\n\n2160\n01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:52,090\nanother thing that we would do\nin a corporate environment,\n\n2161\n01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:56,390\ninstead of relying on my end users to\nsend invitations down to the help desk so\n\n2162\n01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:57,800\nthat they can get their computer fixed.\n\n2163\n01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,150\nWe use this in a corporate\nenvironment all the time.\n\n2164\n01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:05,210\nThat's a great way for my users to submit\na ticket you know and request assistance.\n\n2165\n01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:12,840\nWe can set it up to where we can send\nan offer instead of waiting for an invite.\n\n2166\n01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:15,530\nSo you know they fill\nout some kind of ticket\n\n2167\n01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:17,100\n>> Some help desk ticket, and\n\n2168\n01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:22,020\nwhen their ticket comes to my next job I\ndon't have to call them up and say hey,\n\n2169\n01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:25,420\nlook, go send me an invite so\nthat I can help you with your machine.\n\n2170\n01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:29,100\nI can push the request to them\nautomatically and say hey,\n\n2171\n01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:31,360\nhere I am,\nI'm ready to help you fix your computer.\n\n2172\n01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:34,010\nWill you allow me to share your screen?\n\n2173\n01:43:34,010 --> 01:43:35,055\nSo you can do it either way.\n\n2174\n01:43:35,055 --> 01:43:36,670\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n2175\n01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:37,620\nAs I choke.\n\n2176\n01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:40,060\nWhat else?\n\n2177\n01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:41,740\nThe user's always in control.\n\n2178\n01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:45,880\nThat's a great thing because they don't\nfeel like they're you know, they might or\n\n2179\n01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:48,740\nmight not trust this person completely.\n\n2180\n01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:52,798\nThey can end that control at any time.\n\n2181\n01:43:52,798 --> 01:43:55,860\n>> Mm-hm, [INAUDIBLE] and\nit can be a learning process as well.\n\n2182\n01:43:55,860 --> 01:44:00,300\nYou can see what's going on and\nhopefully can fix it.\n\n2183\n01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:03,540\nHopefully.\n>> Yeah, we're trying to eliminate calls\n\n2184\n01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:06,530\nto the help desk, so if they're having\nthis problem every single week.\n\n2185\n01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:10,490\nYou know through remote assistance,\nI can see what they're doing.\n\n2186\n01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:13,880\nI can say, look this is why this problem\nis happening, what if we do it this way,\n\n2187\n01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,060\nor lets change this.\n\n2188\n01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:19,390\nWe can share that connection and\nwe can work out that problem.\n\n2189\n01:44:19,390 --> 01:44:21,690\nIt's fantastic, I do love it.\n\n2190\n01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:27,090\nAnother really cool thing is, my mother\nsent me an invitation from Tampa.\n\n2191\n01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:30,430\nWe don't have a VPN connection set up,\nwe don't have.\n\n2192\n01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:31,390\nWe're not on the same network.\n\n2193\n01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:34,280\nAnything like that connects\nto her no problem.\n\n2194\n01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,900\nThe invitation has everything I need\n\n2195\n01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:40,930\nto connect to her machine even though\nwe're in different parts of the country.\n\n2196\n01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:42,170\nSo, okay.\nVery cool.\n\n2197\n01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:42,720\n>> Pretty

this morning?\n\n9\n00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,440\n>> I have, not gonna lie to you guys,\nI've drank too much coffee and\n\n10\n00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,695\nI'm kinda tweaking out over here.\n\n11\n00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:50,257\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay,\n\n12\n00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:54,350\nsweet [LAUGH]\n>> I am energized and ready to rock, for\n\n13\n00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,250\nwhatever reason I've had too much coffee,\nbut that's cool because I am energized and\n\n14\n00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,170\nready to go on Windows 8.\n\n15\n00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,520\nWe are gonna be taking a look\nat mobility stuff today, right?\n\n16\n00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,360\n>> Yeah,\nquite a bit of mobility stuff to go today.\n\n17\n00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,880\nYou know things like offline files,\npower policies, a bit of Windows To Go,\n\n18\n00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,380\nand some BitLocker, yeah,\nwe got quite a bit of stuff jam-packed.\n\n19\n00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,510\nIt should be an all-star lineup.\n\n20\n00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,480\n>> And you know you I'll tell you guys\n\n21\n00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,020\nI first got certified with\nMicrosoft under Windows NT4.\n\n22\n00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,480\nSo I'm an NT4 MCSE.\n\n23\n00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,260\nBack in the NT4 days, laptops didn't\nexist, I mean they existed, but\n\n24\n00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,880\nthey didn't exist in\nthe eyes of Microsoft.\n\n25\n00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,050\nSo there really was no\nmobility stuff to learn.\n\n26\n00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,390\nThen in Windows 2000, we really started\nto see a lot more laptops out there.\n\n27\n00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,460\n>> By the time we got to Windows XP,\nlaptops were selling more than desktops.\n\n28\n00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,600\nSo they had taken over\n50% of the market share.\n\n29\n00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,616\nToday, in the Windows 7 and Windows 8\nworld, most people just buy laptops.\n\n30\n00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:02,329\nEven if they don't need to go and\ntravel, just to have it in their house,\n\n31\n00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:03,133\neasy to move around.\n\n32\n00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,550\nPeople buy laptops.\n\n33\n00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:10,080\nSo in the real world,\nyou're gonna see a lot of it.\n\n34\n00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,090\nWe have a lot of things\nto take into account.\n\n35\n00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,840\nThings like battery power, and\nnot always being plugged into a network,\n\n36\n00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,790\nor even having wireless networks.\n\n37\n00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,020\nThat stuff that we take for granted in\nthe desktop world is different in laptops.\n\n38\n00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,500\nWe really need to know about it, enough so\nthat Microsoft dedicated an entire\n\n39\n00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,950\nobjective to it, which is what we're\ntackling today, which is objective five.\n\n40\n00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,160\nConfigure remote access and mobility.\n\n41\n00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,350\nAnd we already jumped into some\nof it during the other shows,\n\n42\n00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,090\nexcept those were things that kind\nof applied to desktops and laptops.\n\n43\n00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,518\nWhat we're gonna look at here in 5.2 and\n\n44\n00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:49,325\n5.3 is stuff that really\nis laptop related.\n\n45\n00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n46\n00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,555\nYeah Don, I enjoy my little\n\n47\n00:02:55,555 --> 00:03:00,535\nconvertible ultrabook here, but\ndeep down inside I am a desktop kinda guy.\n\n48\n00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,435\nI used to have a big beefy machine.\n\n49\n00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:05,665\nI do enjoy the mobility.\n\n50\n00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,660\nBut desktop, it's hard to beat.\n\n51\n00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,370\n>> That's just because you haven't found\na laptop with Dual SLI graphics cards and\n\n52\n00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,160\nwater cooling.\n\n53\n00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,380\nIf they made a laptop like that,\nyou'll be fine with it.\n\n54\n00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,970\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, that'll be awesome.\n\n55\n00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,770\n>> And it supports like five hard drives.\n\n56\n00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,663\nCause you gotta have your mirror for\nyour OS.\n\n57\n00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:23,937\n>> Yeah, and\ndefinitely policies for that one.\n\n58\n00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,750\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so\nlet's go ahead and jump in here and\n\n59\n00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,130\nstart to take a look at some of these.\n\n60\n00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,950\nThe very first thing that\nwe want to talk about.\n\n61\n00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,900\nWe are going to to a little out of order\nfrom the Microsoft objectives because\n\n62\n00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,990\none of the things we want to talk about\nis one of the coolest things in Windows 8\n\n63\n00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,430\nit's called Windows to Go.\n\n64\n00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,370\nWhen we think about mobility, lets say I'm\ngoing to go on a trip so I'm going to go\n\n65\n00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,130\nout to Seattle and if it's a business\ntrip I might take my laptop with me.\n\n66\n00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,820\nBut a laptop it can be big,\n\n67\n00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,570\nit can be bulky you got your\npower cables and all that stuff.\n\n68\n00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,080\nWhat if I'm going somewhere and\nI know there's gonna be a computer there?\n\n69\n00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,580\nOr what if this is just a frequent trip?\n\n70\n00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,680\nI've got a computer at home, I've got\na computer at work, and I go back and\n\n71\n00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,700\nforth between them a lot?\n\n72\n00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,130\nWell what we can do is we can\nuse Windows To Go to install\n\n73\n00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,090\nan entire copy of Windows\n8 on a removable drive.\n\n74\n00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,490\nA removable hard drive like this one,\nwhich is black so it's hard to see, but\n\n75\n00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,860\na removable hard drive just like this one.\n\n76\n00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,520\nAnd instead of carrying around a laptop,\nI can just carry around this.\n\n77\n00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,520\nThis little tiny drive\nfits in your pocket.\n\n78\n00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,830\nIt's a little bit bigger than an iPhone.\n\n79\n00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,700\nBut you can tote it.\n\n80\n00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,860\nI mean, a little bit bigger\nthan a Windows Mobile phone.\n\n81\n00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,874\nBut maybe two viewers know how big\nthose are, an iPhone is, whatever.\n\n82\n00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:41,980\nBut I can tell you we're Android guys so\nI guess it doesn't matter.\n\n83\n00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,970\nBut you carry this thing around and\nwhen you get to work,\n\n84\n00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,460\nyou plug it into the computer and\n\n85\n00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,640\nyou boot off of this device, instead of\nbooting off the internal drives at work.\n\n86\n00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,380\nAnd you get home and\n\n87\n00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,860\nyou boot off of this device instead\nof the hard drives in the computer.\n\n88\n00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,900\nAnd so no matter what hardware you're on,\nyou're running that same\n\n89\n00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,080\ninstall of Windows with your applications,\nyour documents.\n\n90\n00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,150\nAll stored right there on your drive.\n\n91\n00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,900\nSo it's trustworthy.\n\n92\n00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,940\n>> Mm-hm. Yeah. One thing that's neat with\nthe Window's To Go is that when you boot\n\n93\n00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,680\noff of it the host computer,\nthe computer's hardware,\n\n94\n00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,880\nits hard drive inside and\nits configuration remains unchanged.\n\n95\n00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,180\nIts internal hard drive is offline.\n\n96\n00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,850\nAnd so the Windows that you're\nrunning won't interact with it.\n\n97\n00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,330\nGreat for, at least, computers or\nif you wanted to try something out and\n\n98\n00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,160\nyou don't want to risk\ndamaging your real install.\n\n99\n00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,680\n>> That's how we use it, right,\nall the crazy junk that we do here.\n\n100\n00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,020\nWe'll experiment with on our drive first.\n\n101\n00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,550\nBut another thing is if\nyou ever go to a hotel,\n\n102\n00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,330\nthe hotels often times have computers\ndown in the lobby for the guests to use.\n\n103\n00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,820\nBut you don't know whose\nused the computers.\n\n104\n00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,800\nYou don't know if they're secure.\n\n105\n00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,730\nYou don't know if they're running\nkey loggers, things like that.\n\n106\n00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,172\nSo you can bring your\nown install of Windows.\n\n107\n00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:02,430\nYou boot up off of it and\nnow it's your install of Windows.\n\n108\n00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,420\nAnd if you have a VPN client loaded then\nyou can VPN into you business network.\n\n109\n00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,150\nAnd you've got a nice secure connection\nand you're not even using the hard drives\n\n110\n00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,960\ninside of that computer\nthat's sitting there.\n\n111\n00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,250\nSo you're safe, your data is safe.\n\n112\n00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,080\n>> Yeah, you shut it down,\nunplug your drive, and\n\n113\n00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,700\nthe lobby's computers remain unchanged and\nyeah, it's all the same.\n\n114\n00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:27,210\nNow, it Windows to go,\nit does require Windows 8 Enterprise.\n\n115\n00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,700\n>> Yes, so\nit is considered a business feature.\n\n116\n00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,480\nIt's not something that a home user\nshould need but a corporation,\n\n117\n00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,160\nsomebody who's running Windows.\n\n118\n00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,310\nIn running the Enterprise edition and\ntheir gonna use it.\n\n119\n00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,540\nYou can't just go to the store and\n\n120\n00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,700\nbuy Windows 8 Enterprise that comes\nwith the volume license agreements.\n\n121\n00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,570\nSo this is a service targeted\ntowards those corporate entities.\n\n122\n00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,040\nNice.\n\n123\n00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,460\nAs most of you know and for those of\nyou who that don't, you really should.\n\n124\n00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,120\nWe always take questions via\nour Live Chat during the show.\n\n125\n00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,480\nSo you can go to ITpro.tv/live and\nask questions.\n\n126\n00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,940\nI mentioned that I was\ntweaking out on coffee so\n\n127\n00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,605\nwe got the comment here if I'm twerking?\n\n128\n00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I were twerking,\n\n129\n00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,760\nI believe I would be on fire, right?\n\n130\n00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,670\nIsn't that the video on YouTube?\n\n131\n00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,870\nSo, but anyhow.\n\n132\n00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,210\n>> You are?\n>> Have you seen that one?\n\n133\n00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,050\nThe twerking on fire?\n\n134\n00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,490\n>> I'm usually just watching\ninstructional videos.\n\n135\n00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,480\n>> Yeah, just education.\n\n136\n00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,902\n>> On how to deal with a server.\n\n137\n00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:25,190\n>> All right, well, for\nthe rest of us, this lady, she twerks,\n\n138\n00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,090\nfalls on a candle, catches on fire.\n\n139\n00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,910\nIt's pretty funny.\n\n140\n00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n141\n00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,990\n>> People on fire, that's funny stuff.\n\n142\n00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,131\n>> Yeah\n>> All right, so\n\n143\n00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:33,450\nenough talk\n>> Right?\n\n144\n00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,360\nLet's get to action.\n\n145\n00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,700\nSo, I've got a hard drive that I'm\nwilling to sacrifice to the cause.\n\n146\n00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,950\nIt's actually already got Windows to\ngo on it, but I'm going to format it.\n\n147\n00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,080\nAnd show you guys the process of\nbuilding up a Windows to go, install.\n\n148\n00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,790\nThat's one of the reasons why we want to\ndo it first, is it can take a long time.\n\n149\n00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,875\nMostly because my device is a crummy one.\n\n150\n00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,959\nI've got a USB 2.0 device.\n\n151\n00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,667\nNate has a USB 3.0 and sitting here beside\nme, that we'll use a little bit later.\n\n152\n00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,660\nIf you're gonna be deploying\nthis in real life,\n\n153\n00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,870\nthey do have hard-drives that\nare certified Windows To Go ready.\n\n154\n00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,540\nRight?\nWhen you go to buy them, like let me,\n\n155\n00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:13,050\nI'll just fire up old Newegg's, whoops,\nI'll try and fire Newegg's page.\n\n156\n00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,015\nNewegg if you're not familiar with them\njust a big retailer of compter hardware\n\n157\n00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:18,235\nand parts.\n\n158\n00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:20,735\nAnd I'll just do a search for\nWindows To Go.\n\n159\n00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:27,792\nAnd so here we can start to find USB\ndevices that are Windows To Go certified.\n\n160\n00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:32,492\nSo see this one right here, it's a USB key\nand it says certified for Windows 8 To Go.\n\n161\n00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:35,162\nRight?\nSo it's geared up, it's USB three,\n\n162\n00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:35,990\nit's ready.\n\n163\n00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,520\nHere's a hard-drive,\n500 gig hard-drive that is.\n\n164\n00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,190\nActually does it say\nWindows To Go in there?\n\n165\n00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,468\nI don't see it.\n\n166\n00:08:44,468 --> 00:08:47,270\nSo you just need to be careful and look\nfor that when you buy these devices to\n\n167\n00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,290\nmake sure that they actually\nsay they are certified for\n\n168\n00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,368\nWindows To Go in a corporate environment.\n\n169\n00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:54,450\nNow my hard-drive next to me is not\ncertified for Windows To Go but\n\n170\n00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,881\nI'm gonna use it anyway and\nit works just fine.\n\n171\n00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:56,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n172\n00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,860\nit doesn't give the optimal experience\nthat Microsoft has envisioned for you.\n\n173\n00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:01,851\n>> Yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:05,750\n>> All right, so\nif I want to do Windows to go\n\n175\n00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,150\nfirst off I need to make sure that I'm\nrunning Windows Enterprise edition.\n\n176\n00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,760\nRight?\n\n177\n00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,980\nAnd so we can, I use the WIN VER\nutility to pull up WIN version.\n\n178\n00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,490\nAnd you can see what version\nof Windows that your running.\n\n179\n00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,690\nAnd actually it doesn't say that\nI'm running Enterprise there.\n\n180\n00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,120\nSo let me go into my system\ncontrol panel instead.\n\n181\n00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,080\nLet me go into system shock 2.\n\n182\n00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,260\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n>> Here we go, system.\n\n183\n00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,760\nSo I'll go into my system panel.\n\n184\n00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,502\nAnd in here it'll tell me that\nI'm running Windows 8 Enterprise.\n\n185\n00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:34,820\nIt's kinda odd that the Win\nversion utility doesn't say that.\n\n186\n00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,470\nThat's funny.\n\n187\n00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,100\nAll right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n188\n00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,160\n>> Well anyhow I can see right here that\nI am running the Enterprise edition.\n\n189\n00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,470\nSo I can build a Windows To Go drive.\n\n190\n00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,590\nAll right.\n\n191\n00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,920\nSo then to build it I just go in\nto my modern UI, not the Metro UI.\n\n192\n00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,750\nGod forbid we called it that.\n\n193\n00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,370\nI'm just going to type windows to go.\n\n194\n00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,110\nAnd under my settings, on the right\nside here, I'll see Windows to Go.\n\n195\n00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,700\nI'll fire that up.\n\n196\n00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,930\nAnd it's going to look at the hard-drives\nattached in my computer and\n\n197\n00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,530\nit's gonna offer to set up Windows to\ngo on the devices I have attached.\n\n198\n00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,140\nNow, I've got an actual hard-drive.\n\n199\n00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,570\nIt works on a USB key,\nhave you done it on a USB key?\n\n200\n00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,410\n>> No, I've just done it on a external\ndrive, or full laptop drives.\n\n201\n00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,630\n>> And I'm the same way.\n\n202\n00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,890\nThe thing to remember, the Windows 8\ninstall itself takes a good 20 to 25 gigs.\n\n203\n00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,770\nAt the end of the day, once its\ncreated all the stuff that it does.\n\n204\n00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,590\nSo, most of our USB keys\naren't that much bigger.\n\n205\n00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:32,550\nYou see a lot of 32 gig and 64 gig ones,\nso it does consume a lot of space.\n\n206\n00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,050\nSo you'll see a lot more people\nusing portable hard drives instead.\n\n207\n00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,948\nThis one is 250 gigs,\nI think yours is 500?\n\n208\n00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:41,580\n>> 320.\n>> It's just 320?\n\n209\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,700\nI guess it will do.\n\n210\n00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,010\n>> It's a black drive, so it's a 7200\nrpm Western Digital black drive.\n\n211\n00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,005\n>> Mine is 7200 rpm also but\nUSB 2.0 is holding me back.\n\n212\n00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,550\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n213\n00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,490\nSo anyhow, so I see my device there and\nI'm gonna pick it now.\n\n214\n00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,280\nIt's warning me that I'm basically gonna\nlose the data on that drive if I install\n\n215\n00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,340\nWindows To Go on it but\nI'm okay with that.\n\n216\n00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,640\nNow to do the install,\nit does require a copy of Windows 8.\n\n217\n00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,310\nAnd I lied to you earlier, Nate, I said,\nyou know, I don't think you need the disk.\n\n218\n00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,610\nYou do actually need a Windows 8 disc\nbecause it needs the install.wim\n\n219\n00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,220\nfile from that disc.\n\n220\n00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,250\nI happen to have the Windows\n8 disc in my machine, so\n\n221\n00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,820\nit found it automatically,\nd:/sources/install.wim.\n\n222\n00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,890\nI told Nate before this show, I was like,\nI don't think it needs the DVD, but\n\n223\n00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,340\nlet me put it in there just in case.\n\n224\n00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,030\nAnd, sure enough, it did need it.\n\n225\n00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,750\nSo I've got it right there.\n\n226\n00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,920\n>> You could also,\nuse your corporation's image.\n\n227\n00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,300\nif you're pushing out a lot of drives.\n\n228\n00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,500\nYou have a custom built image\nthat you roll out to things.\n\n229\n00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,900\nI mean yeah, for our purposes\nwe just use the Windows 8 DVD.\n\n230\n00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,480\n>> That's a good point.\n\n231\n00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,790\nYeah, this is just a stock\nWin file right here.\n\n232\n00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,790\nIt's the basic Windows 8 installer.\n\n233\n00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,960\nYou're company could have a very fleshed\nout, like we have a cool image here,\n\n234\n00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,390\nthat's got Microsoft Office built\ninto it and the Adobe suite.\n\n235\n00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,840\nSo, we can roll that out to a machine, and\n\n236\n00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,850\nit's already got the software\nthat's on there.\n\n237\n00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,450\nRight?\n\n238\n00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,100\nYou just need to make sure that\nyour licenses allow for that.\n\n239\n00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,485\nAdobe in particular,\nreally strict about their licensing.\n\n240\n00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:12,860\nFortunately their new like\nonline subscription model,\n\n241\n00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,090\nyou can install the software, but\nit doesn't work until somebody logs in.\n\n242\n00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,900\nSo it doesn't need a license.\n\n243\n00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,300\nAll right, so I'll just hit Next on that.\n\n244\n00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,728\nIt's also going to offer\nto enable BitLocker.\n\n245\n00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:27,210\nNow, we're gonna talk about\nBitLocker in a minute.\n\n246\n00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,820\nSo I'm gonna leave this be, but just kind\nof stick that in the back of your mind\n\n247\n00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,860\nthat I could have turned\non BitLocker right here.\n\n248\n00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,400\nSo, I'm just gonna skip it.\n\n249\n00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,910\nThen I'll go ahead and hit Create, and\nnow it's gonna get that USB drive ready.\n\n250\n00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,170\nIt's gonna format it, it's gonna get\nit set up with the right file system,\n\n251\n00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,180\nand then it's gonna start copying\nthose Windows 8 files over.\n\n252\n00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,380\nIt copies over about three gigs of files\nand expands them to about ten gigs and\n\n253\n00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,476\non a USB 2 device it's\ngonna take a little while.\n\n254\n00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,288\n>> Yeah.\n\n255\n00:12:56,288 --> 00:13:00,850\n>> What do you think Nate?\n\n256\n00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,460\nShould we just leave that running and talk\nabout other stuff or should I switch over\n\n257\n00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,520\nto your drive and boot up so that I\ncan show people the finished product?\n\n258\n00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,900\n>> Let's just let this guy grind out for\na little bit.\n\n259\n00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,830\n>> Okay.\n\n260\n00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,750\nSo it is gonna take a while\nto move through and\n\n261\n00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,410\nif it doesn't finish in a reasonable\ntime I'll switch over to Nate's drive,\n\n262\n00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,420\nwhich already has Windows To Go on it.\n\n263\n00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,945\nSo we got a couple of options there but\nit's gonna turn along.\n\n264\n00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:22,405\nIt's gonna get that drive ready.\n\n265\n00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:23,895\nThen we'll be in business.\n\n266\n00:13:23,895 --> 00:13:26,255\n>> All right, yeah, sweet.\n\n267\n00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:31,640\nWe've got Windows to go so\nI guess we'll move on to offline files.\n\n268\n00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,170\n>> Yes.\n\n269\n00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,135\n>> Okay.\nAll right, the Offline files.\n\n270\n00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:36,060\nRight?\n\n271\n00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,660\nYou have a network share and\nin access network share,\n\n272\n00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,420\nthey've got all the files on it.\n\n273\n00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:48,660\nAnd offline files will allow a user to\ncash those files locally on their machine.\n\n274\n00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,210\nSo if they are not\nconnected to the network.\n\n275\n00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:57,000\nThey can still access that cached files\non their computer and the next time they\n\n276\n00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,880\nconnect to the network then those changes\nwill be synced up to that network chair.\n\n277\n00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,660\n>> Yeah, and\nthis used to be a really popular feature\n\n278\n00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,880\nbecause you might not be at the office,\non the bus ride home, or\n\n279\n00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,100\neven at home you might not\nhave a network connection.\n\n280\n00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,030\nBut in today's world,\n\n281\n00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,130\nwith networks being so prevalent as they\nare, you almost always have connectivity.\n\n282\n00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,800\nEven your laptops might have\ncellular modems in them.\n\n283\n00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,490\nAnd so you can just build up a VPN\ntunnel to work and work remotely.\n\n284\n00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,810\nSo this feature's become less\nprominent but it is still there and\n\n285\n00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,040\nmany people do still use it.\n\n286\n00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,360\nEspecially if you're in rural areas or\n\n287\n00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,410\nsmall towns where you don't have\nextensive wireless networks available.\n\n288\n00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,620\n>> Yeah, and we have a network\nshare here that we can yeah,\n\n289\n00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,094\nconnect to it and create offline\n>> Yeah,\n\n290\n00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:46,943\nabsolutely\n>> [SOUND] Sorry I hum.\n\n291\n00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:48,462\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nNate's gonna fire up some machines here.\n\n292\n00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,380\nWe've got a client and a server and so\n\n293\n00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,458\nhe'll demonstrate\n>> All right, so on my machine here.\n\n294\n00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,040\nRight?\n\n295\n00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,340\nIt's just a copy of Windows 8.\n\n296\n00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:05,808\nAnd [COUGH] all right, so down here,\nWe have this network share.\n\n297\n00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:06,440\nRight?\n\n298\n00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,090\nGame save is what it is because if it's\none thing that we do want to share so\n\n299\n00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,930\nthe game save codes that we have,\nthat we can share with everybody.\n\n300\n00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,250\nAnd to create this software.\n\n301\n00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,260\nSo, yeah, we click on it and there we go.\n\n302\n00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,930\nThere's those things.\n\n303\n00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,810\nAnd to create offline we just right-click\non it and always available offline.\n\n304\n00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:32,340\nIt will go and set those permissions\nup and copy those files down locally.\n\n305\n00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,640\nAnd now since there's only just a couple\nfiles in there, it goes by pretty fast.\n\n306\n00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,983\nSo now it, oh, man.\n\n307\n00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,290\nYeah, at the bottom\nyou'll have a new icon.\n\n308\n00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,610\nI will open this up.\n\n309\n00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,235\n>> Jason can we take\nthat desktop full screen?\n\n310\n00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:52,292\nLet's get it so we can see the icon.\n\n311\n00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:57,267\nThe icon is just a little thing that\nindicates to let you know that the offline\n\n312\n00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:58,750\nfiles are running.\n\n313\n00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,458\nThere you go.\n\n314\n00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,054\nYep.\nSo this little green file down here,\n\n315\n00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:01,833\nSync Center, right?\n\n316\n00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:06,777\nSync Center and Offline Files,\nI wouldn't say they are the same thing,\n\n317\n00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:09,360\nbut they work together.\n\n318\n00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,155\nSo now that little icon appears.\n\n319\n00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:17,210\nRight-click on that, and\nclicking Open Sync Center brings this up,\n\n320\n00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:22,120\nand just a, yeah, a little window\nhere to show the, yeah, I guess,\n\n321\n00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,730\nour offline file stuff and what we've got.\n\n322\n00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,350\n>> Yeah, and\nthen if you go off the network, normally,\n\n323\n00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,510\nif you go off the network,\n\n324\n00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,635\nif you leave, that drive, what drive\nletter was it, Z or something like that?\n\n325\n00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:34,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n326\n00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,930\n>> So if you were to go off the network,\nthe Z drive in this case,\n\n327\n00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,980\nthat network share would just disappear,\nyou wouldn't see it.\n\n328\n00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,820\nSo if you went to my computer it wouldn't\nbe there, or it would have a red X on it\n\n329\n00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,760\nand say disconnected and if you clicked on\nit, it would say, can't connect to server.\n\n330\n00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,030\nAnd so you just wouldn't\nhave access to those files.\n\n331\n00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,040\nBut with Offline Access turned on,\n\n332\n00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,210\nwhen you go off the network,\nyou'll still see the Z drive.\n\n333\n00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,270\nAnd if you browse into it,\nyou'll still see those files and\n\n334\n00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,490\nbe able to work with them.\n\n335\n00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,410\nAnd what you're actually doing is\nworking with a locally cached copy.\n\n336\n00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,261\nAnd the next time you connect to\nthe network, it'll sync 'em up.\n\n337\n00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:10,822\nSo Nate, we can just disable the network\ncard to simulate that, right?\n\n338\n00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,735\n>> Yep, let me do that right quick.\n\n339\n00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:16,133\n>> So he's just gonna\ndisable the network card, so\n\n340\n00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:18,970\nthat will make us lose\nour network connection.\n\n341\n00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,130\nAnd then once that's done he can try and\naccess those files.\n\n342\n00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,495\nAnd I didn't pay attention,\nwere those just text files?\n\n343\n00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:25,360\nOr-\n>> Correct.\n\n344\n00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,970\nThat was a special editor or anything.\n\n345\n00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,454\nSo he's disabling that.\n\n346\n00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:39,592\nSlowly but surely, it will disable.\n\n347\n00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,470\nI guess we could've gone into hyper V and\njust unplugged it there.\n\n348\n00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,925\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n349\n00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:49,390\nYeah, because it was,\n\n350\n00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,100\nI remoted directly into it instead\nof going through the hyper V.\n\n351\n00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,510\n>> Oh, the hyper v console.\n\n352\n00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,832\nSo you unfortunately don't\nhave offline access to RDP,\n\n353\n00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:01,076\nso- [LAUGH]\n>> Funny.\n\n354\n00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:04,309\nAll right.\n\n355\n00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,848\n>> So as soon as he gains access to\nthe laptop again, it's now offline, right,\n\n356\n00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:14,222\nbecause its network cable's unplugged,\nbut it will still be able to get to those\n\n357\n00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:17,207\nnetwork files since they\nare made available offline.\n\n358\n00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,125\nEventually, all right, there we go.\n\n359\n00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:36,848\nAll right, so he's logged in and\nwe can see the network card is disabled.\n\n360\n00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:41,225\nAnd in the background, see how the network\ndrive shows that red X on there, and\n\n361\n00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:44,359\nsays that it is disconnected,\nis what that red X means.\n\n362\n00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,374\nYeah, double clicking on this guy,\n\n363\n00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:52,834\nwe can still get in to the folder there,\nwe can open this up and say.\n\n364\n00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:02,110\nAll right, so the network's offline,\ntime to load up, and play all those games.\n\n365\n00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:07,270\nSo we can still write to it\nright there locally, cache copy.\n\n366\n00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,089\nWe'll save it.\n\n367\n00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:13,255\nI'll get back into the hyper v and\nI'll just open that back up.\n\n368\n00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:16,297\n>> [LAUGH] Re enable the network adapter,\nyep.\n\n369\n00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:22,120\nAnd with the sync settings, you can\nactually define when it synchronizes.\n\n370\n00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,920\nBy default it synchronizes when\nyou log on and when you log off.\n\n371\n00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,120\nSo, like, when you log off it\nassumes you're about to leave so\n\n372\n00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,490\nit synchronizes everything.\n\n373\n00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,800\nAnd when you log on it assumes\nyou're back at the office, and so\n\n374\n00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,010\nit tries to upload it.\n\n375\n00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,830\nBut you can also set it to do a schedule,\nwhere it updates every hour,\n\n376\n00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,750\nor whatever so\nyou can define all sorts of things.\n\n377\n00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,510\nAnd you can manually sync it by right\nclicking on that icon down there in\n\n378\n00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,676\nthe system tray and choosing sync all,\nand it will sync everything.\n\n379\n00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:50,260\nSo that's what Nate's doing right\nnow is he's gonna hit that sync all.\n\n380\n00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,380\nOnce it's back on the network,\nit syncs out, and\n\n381\n00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,840\nshould upload his data up to the server.\n\n382\n00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,600\nAnd now all that work he did while he was\non the bus or whatever, it's uploaded, and\n\n383\n00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,535\nnow it's available for everybody.\n\n384\n00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,060\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n385\n00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,324\n>> Now one thing I do wanna mention is\nthat you can occasionally end up with\n\n386\n00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:08,941\nconflicts.\n\n387\n00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:13,792\nA conflict is where maybe Nate and\nI are both synchronizing that games saves\n\n388\n00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:18,951\nfolder and we both go offline and I'm at\nhome and I'm playing Legend of Zelda and\n\n389\n00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:24,649\nI put in some Game Shark codes, and you go\nhome, you're playing Lolo's Adventure 2 or\n\n390\n00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:25,941\nwhatever-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n391\n00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,570\n>> And Bubble Bobble, and\n\n392\n00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,435\nyou put in your codes.\n\n393\n00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:32,045\nAnd we get back to the office and\nwe're both trying to sync up.\n\n394\n00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:36,320\nWell he's made changes and I've made\nchanges, they're gonna conflict, right.\n\n395\n00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,817\nSo when that happens, the sync\ncenter will give you a warning, and\n\n396\n00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:43,390\nit'll say there's a conflict, and\nit will ask you to deal with it.\n\n397\n00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,992\nAnd you can choose, do you overwrite his\nstuff, does he overwrite your stuff, or\n\n398\n00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:51,125\ndo you save it as two files,\nand then you can edit it, and\n\n399\n00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,410\nmanually merge the settings together.\n\n400\n00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,070\nSo it does have a mechanism\nbuilt in to handle\n\n401\n00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,925\nthings like that, that disconnect\nwhen two people edit the same file.\n\n402\n00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n403\n00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,190\nYeah.\n\n404\n00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,980\n>> All right.\n\n405\n00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,950\nWhat else do we have on offline files?\n\n406\n00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,170\nThere's not too much more.\n\n407\n00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,030\nThey mention it in a different spot,\noh no they mention it right here.\n\n408\n00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,770\nOffline file policies.\n\n409\n00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,460\nThere is one other thing\nI want to show you,\n\n410\n00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,730\nwhat Nate just did right there he manually\nflagged those files to be available off\n\n411\n00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,350\nline by right clicking on the folder and\nchoosing make available offline.\n\n412\n00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,110\nRight.\n\n413\n00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,590\nBut there is another setting, and did you,\nmaybe you had it in your outline and\n\n414\n00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,890\nI'm jumping ahead.\n\n415\n00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,940\nWhat did I do with your outline?\n\n416\n00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,830\n>> Yeah, that's setting a slow\nlink stuff because it sets when,\n\n417\n00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,120\nif it's on a slow link it won't cache.\n\n418\n00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,070\nIt won't sync up.\n\n419\n00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,890\n>> If you're on dial up or whatever.\n\n420\n00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,319\n>> Either connections, it won't sync.\n\n421\n00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,030\n>> So\nlet me just show you guys some of that,\n\n422\n00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,510\nI'll show you right here on my laptop.\n\n423\n00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,630\nI'm just going to pull it up on my\nmodern UI and I'll type in offline\n\n424\n00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,854\nfile and here under settings it\nwill turn up manage offline files.\n\n425\n00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:06,830\nAnd in here, so I've got it turned off\nright now, but if I turn it on, and\n\n426\n00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,370\nI go into My Sync Center,\nwe have various options in here.\n\n427\n00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,330\nHere's the view conflicts that i was\ntalking about, but you've also got other\n\n428\n00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,280\nsettings you needed to find things like\nhow the offline files are being managed\n\n429\n00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,650\nand some of this stuff is done\nautomatically for us on the server, right?\n\n430\n00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,110\nWhen somebody sets up a file share, they\ncan define all offline settings on that\n\n431\n00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,680\nfolder to determine whether they even\nwant to allow it to be available offline.\n\n432\n00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,050\nThey could disable it.\n\n433\n00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,530\nAnd, I'm not seeing the option\nthat I'm looking for,\n\n434\n00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,410\nwhich is where we can define the,\noh, here, Sync Setup.\n\n435\n00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,430\nWell, no.\nSync Setup does not take me where I want,\n\n436\n00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,390\nwhere we can set the sync schedule and\nall of that.\n\n437\n00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,930\nIt is, oh, maybe because I\ndon't have anything set up.\n\n438\n00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,190\nDid you have the option in yours?\n\n439\n00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,780\nBecause you can define like automatic\ncaching, where when you access a file,\n\n440\n00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,590\neven if you tell them not to\nmake it available offline,\n\n441\n00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,520\nif you don't manually do it, it will\nautomatically cache some things offline,\n\n442\n00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,300\njust because you worked on that or\nyou worked with them.\n\n443\n00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,070\nSo there is functionality like that,\nkind of built-in to the offline access.\n\n444\n00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,830\nAnd I didn't see that option in there.\n\n445\n00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,420\nBut there are a few other things built in.\n\n446\n00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,720\nWell the basic functionality of it,\nitself, it's really not that complex.\n\n447\n00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,890\nYou just take a folder that you want\noffline, you right click on it and choose,\n\n448\n00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,440\nmake it available.\n\n449\n00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,220\n>> Yep, now, there is the option\nto encrypt the offline files.\n\n450\n00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,790\nSo let's say if you're working with\nsensitive information, spreadsheets or\n\n451\n00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,200\nsomething, those cached offline files have\n\n452\n00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,180\nthe option to encrypt those, so when\nyou take them off of your work network,\n\n453\n00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,360\nif your laptop is stolen,\nthen that cash is encrypted.\n\n454\n00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,083\nAnd there's also,\nyou can set file screens.\n\n455\n00:23:55,083 --> 00:24:01,250\nLet's say those Excel files have a lot\nof real important information on it.\n\n456\n00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,917\nAnd you don't want those\nIt's to leave the network.\n\n457\n00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:09,078\nAnd you can set file\nscreens to where anything\n\n458\n00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:13,810\nwith an XLS will be blocked\nfrom caching offline.\n\n459\n00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,090\n>> And you do that on the server side,\nright?\n\n460\n00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,840\n>> Through policy.\n\n461\n00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,315\n>> Okay, so\nyou have to do it through a policy.\n\n462\n00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:23,100\nAll right, so some of the options\nwe don't get in the GUI.\n\n463\n00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,670\nSo I've got the GUI pulled up right here,\nand you'll see I can turn on encryption.\n\n464\n00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,690\nSo I've got that button.\n\n465\n00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,940\nAnd it just uses EFS, it uses\nthe encrypting file system to do that.\n\n466\n00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,420\nBut things like the file screen,\nI don't have that option in here.\n\n467\n00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,240\nSo I'd have to set up a policy\nto be able to do that.\n\n468\n00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,860\nAnd we normally do that on\nthe server side, not locally.\n\n469\n00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,540\nSo just be aware that\nthose options are there.\n\n470\n00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,230\nA group policy object can\nmanage a lot of this.\n\n471\n00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,180\nAll right, I'm gonna go ahead and\nturn that off.\n\n472\n00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,380\nCuz I don't actually have the need for\nSync Center and all that stuff.\n\n473\n00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,800\nOh, it's kinda reboot to turn\noff offline file access.\n\n474\n00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,410\nThat's convenient.\n\n475\n00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,090\nActually, you know what,\nI think maybe I'm ready to reboot, though.\n\n476\n00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,020\nI think Windows To Go is done.\n\n477\n00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,190\nIt is done.\n\n478\n00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,160\nSo Windows To Go is done.\n\n479\n00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,150\nI'm gonna go ahead and close this down.\n\n480\n00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,909\nMy hard drive is finished installing,\nso I wanna reboot and\n\n481\n00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,576\nstart to kinda boot that system up.\n\n482\n00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,035\nNow, I'm gonna ahead and say reboot.\n\n483\n00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:20,300\nAnd we're gonna go to Skycam\nto see this thing rebooting.\n\n484\n00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,841\nLet me move some of this stuff.\n\n485\n00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:25,345\nI've got my coffee in the Skycam spot.\n\n486\n00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:27,350\nSo, you know what?\n\n487\n00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,160\nShoot.\nAnd then I got distracted and\n\n488\n00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,050\nI missed the F12 box.\n\n489\n00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,570\nSo let me, I've got the reboot anyway.\n\n490\n00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,728\nLet me get this moved over here so\nwe can see it on the Skycam.\n\n491\n00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:44,050\n>> Now with those offline,\nor the offline files.\n\n492\n00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,170\nNow there is, through a policy setting,\n\n493\n00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,770\nyou can actually block\nthe use of offline files.\n\n494\n00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:57,180\nIf for the sensitive information you don't\nwant employees caching that and working.\n\n495\n00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,330\nTaking it off the network.\n\n496\n00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,185\nYeah, you can just block that\nfunctionality altogether.\n\n497\n00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,050\n>> All right, here we go.\n\n498\n00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,580\nSo I rebooted my machine,\nand on my laptop.\n\n499\n00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,420\nIf you hit F12 when it boots,\nyou get the boot menu.\n\n500\n00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,090\nAnd that's what I'm looking at here.\n\n501\n00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:17,390\nAnd normally I boot right\noff of the EFI boot for\n\n502\n00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,230\nWindows, the Windows boot manager.\n\n503\n00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,250\nI've got a SSD in my laptop.\n\n504\n00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,424\nAnd that's what's showing up right there,\nis that SSD.\n\n505\n00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:25,840\nSo that's normally what I boot off of.\n\n506\n00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,650\nBut now when I boot up,\nI have a second option.\n\n507\n00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,070\nAnd notice it is EFI.\n\n508\n00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,720\nWhich means, if you've got secure boot and\nall that turned on, it works just fine.\n\n509\n00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,170\nYou don't have to turn off secure boot.\n\n510\n00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,280\nYou don't have to go\ninto Legacy Bios mode.\n\n511\n00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,630\nYou can do it all from your UEFI.\n\n512\n00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,140\nSo I see that USB disk, and\nI can choose that to boot off of it.\n\n513\n00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,530\nNow, I had to use the F12 menu.\n\n514\n00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:49,130\nCuz my boot order doesn't have\na USB above the hard drive.\n\n515\n00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,880\nYou can kinda see down here\nmy legacy boot, the order.\n\n516\n00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,690\nBut on your laptop or\nyour device you may have it different.\n\n517\n00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,020\nYou may have it where USB\nis a higher priority.\n\n518\n00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,300\nSo I'll pick that.\n\n519\n00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,030\nAnd now, instead of booting off of\nthe hard drive inside of my laptop.\n\n520\n00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:10,560\nIt's gonna boot off of my USB\ndrive that's sitting right here.\n\n521\n00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,900\nSo it's gonna boot off of that.\n\n522\n00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,810\nNow, this boot process is booting off\nthis drive, which is a USB 2.0 drive.\n\n523\n00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,523\nAnd this is the first time\nthat Windows 8 is booting up.\n\n524\n00:27:21,523 --> 00:27:26,039\nAnd so it is gonna have to go through that\nprocess of setting up the installation and\n\n525\n00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,486\ndetecting the hardware.\n\n526\n00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:30,310\nNate, have you already\ndone that on your drive?\n\n527\n00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,220\nLet me switch to yours.\n\n528\n00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,540\nSo that it'll be faster.\n\n529\n00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,880\nYours is gonna be faster\nanyway cuz it's USB 3.0.\n\n530\n00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,225\nLet me switch over to his.\n\n531\n00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:43,610\nAnd since his has already completed\nthe initial installation.\n\n532\n00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,900\nYou know when you install WIndows 8 the\nfirst time it makes you pick a name for\n\n533\n00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,820\nthe computer.\n\n534\n00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,980\nAnd a color theme and all that stuff?\n\n535\n00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,133\nSo, Nate's already done that on his,\nthat'll make this a little speedier.\n\n536\n00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:58,719\nLet's go back to the Skycam and\nwe'll see me hitting F12 here.\n\n537\n00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,390\nWell, whenever the laptop turns on.\n\n538\n00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,310\nMy little keyboard lights are on.\n\n539\n00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,170\nWhat have I done?\n\n540\n00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,710\nI'm gonna do a hard reboot.\n\n541\n00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,810\nIt's probably upset that I yanked\nthat USB drive while it was booting.\n\n542\n00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,510\nSo here it goes.\n\n543\n00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,610\nIt's gonna start firing up any second now.\n\n544\n00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,620\nThere we go.\n\n545\n00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,130\nSo I'm just hitting F12 to\nget that boot menu back up.\n\n546\n00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,100\nAnd I'll go in here and\nchoose this time, Nate's disk.\n\n547\n00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,580\nAnd now it's gonna boot off of his.\n\n548\n00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:32,309\nIt's got that Windows 8 on there, so\nit's gonna fire up that Windows 8 thing.\n\n549\n00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:33,277\nAnd this should be considerably faster.\n\n550\n00:28:33,277 --> 00:28:35,123\nUSB 3.0, I forget what the speeds.\n\n551\n00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:39,825\nBut it's like three times as fast,\nor four times as fast as USB 2.\n\n552\n00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:40,510\n>> Yeah.\n\n553\n00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,427\n>> Something ridiculous.\n\n554\n00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:44,800\n>> Yeah, something ridiculous.\n\n555\n00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,190\nSo, yeah, I mean,\nit will be fast enough to be productive.\n\n556\n00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,770\nYou can work off of it.\n\n557\n00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,626\nBut of course,\nrunning off of the Windows To Go,\n\n558\n00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:58,303\nthat'll just naturally be slightly slower.\n\n559\n00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,809\nI guess, since it's a new PC,\n\n560\n00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:05,257\nit has gonna have to set that\nup in reboot once or twice.\n\n561\n00:29:05,257 --> 00:29:07,930\n>> Well,\ndid you ever boot this on your laptop?\n\n562\n00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,990\nSo we have the same laptop.\n\n563\n00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,240\nSo the hardware detection should\nbe pretty straightforward.\n\n564\n00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,530\nNow activation.\n\n565\n00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,114\nHere's the thing, the main reason that\n\n566\n00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:20,990\nWindows To Go is only supported in\nthe Enterprise edition, is activation.\n\n567\n00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,500\nNormally, if you take a Windows install.\n\n568\n00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,190\nAnd you move it from\none device to another.\n\n569\n00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,660\nIf it detects new hardware,\nit makes you reactivate.\n\n570\n00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,120\nWell, if you got a Windows To Go drive,\n\n571\n00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,190\nyou might be moving around from\nsystem to system pretty frequently.\n\n572\n00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,240\nAnd so you'd constantly be reactivating.\n\n573\n00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,000\nAnd so you'd run out of your activations,\nright?\n\n574\n00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,530\nMicrosoft would stop you.\n\n575\n00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:43,020\nWith Windows 8 Enterprise,\nyou don't use activations the same way.\n\n576\n00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,370\nYou use what's called a KMS,\na Key Management Server.\n\n577\n00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,140\nAnd you have a key.\n\n578\n00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,880\nBut instead of reaching out to Microsoft,\n\n579\n00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,870\nyou reach out to your corporate's\nKey Management Server.\n\n580\n00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,790\nYou reach out to their license server.\n\n581\n00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,120\nAnd so, you're basically\ntelling that license server.\n\n582\n00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,210\nHere's how many licenses I'm using.\n\n583\n00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,240\nAnd then that server reaches out\nto Microsoft on your behalf.\n\n584\n00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,310\nAnd it will recognize that\nyou're a Windows To Go install.\n\n585\n00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,033\nAnd not require you to do an activation.\n\n586\n00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:14,690\nSo when I boot up here I can see a nice,\nclean Windows 8 installed.\n\n587\n00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:19,140\nIt's not mine, I didn't see\nthe Seattle skyline when I logged in.\n\n588\n00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,470\nThe metro UI was much cleaner than\nmine which is littered with junk.\n\n589\n00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,890\nAnd my wallpaper is nice little flowers,\ninstead of the ITproTV logo.\n\n590\n00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,810\nThis is a clean Windows 8 install\nrunning entirely from this USB drive.\n\n591\n00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,590\nAnd if I browse into the USB, browse\ninto the computer here, all right, and\n\n592\n00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,520\nI look at it.\n\n593\n00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,158\nSee how I see the C drive.\n\n594\n00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:44,258\nAnd that's the drive\nthat's attached via USB.\n\n595\n00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:49,018\nI don't see the internal SSD that's\non this computer, and that's,\n\n596\n00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:50,720\nagain, protecting us.\n\n597\n00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,529\nIf you're plugged into a Kinko's\nmachine or a hotel machine,\n\n598\n00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,095\nyou don't wanna see their drive.\n\n599\n00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:59,190\nCuz it's probably infected and full of\njunk, so it hides that stuff by default.\n\n600\n00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,340\nAnd I'm just seeing this external\ndrive that I've got attached.\n\n601\n00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,840\nSo, really cool stuff, and\nI could take this from machine-to-machine.\n\n602\n00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,580\nNate had this setup on his computer.\n\n603\n00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,650\nAnd you guys saw,\nit booted in about two minutes.\n\n604\n00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,845\nAnd it's up, it's running, and it's happy.\n\n605\n00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:19,702\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, and once it's booted up in\nthere, I mean, it is fairly responsive.\n\n606\n00:31:19,702 --> 00:31:24,740\nI mean, it doesn't lag too bad, and\nyou'll still be yeah, fairly effective.\n\n607\n00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,740\n>> I mean,\nI would fire up Solitaire or whatever.\n\n608\n00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,190\nBut you don't have\nanything cool installed.\n\n609\n00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,530\nJust Internet Explorer I guess.\n\n610\n00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,007\n>> Well, that's pretty cool.\n\n611\n00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:36,794\n>> So, [LAUGH] yeah,\nInternet Explorer, that's cool.\n\n612\n00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,954\nOh, I guess I need to join my\nwireless networks and all that.\n\n613\n00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:42,135\nBut, anyhow,\nit's upset about not being connected.\n\n614\n00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:44,199\nBut yeah, so really cool, really neat.\n\n615\n00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:48,984\nOne of the really, I think one of\nthe flag-ship features of Windows 8,\n\n616\n00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:51,740\nfor the various things they introduced.\n\n617\n00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,375\nAll right, well,\nit looks like I've talked too much.\n\n618\n00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,043\nSo we've kinda run past our break time.\n\n619\n00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,164\nSo let's stop here and\n\n620\n00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:02,125\ndo you have anything else to\nthrow in before we take a break?\n\n621\n00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:02,877\n>> I'm good.\n\n622\n00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:03,417\n>> All right.\n\n623\n00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,917\nWe got more mobility features coming.\n\n624\n00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:10,067\nSo definitely stay tuned for that\naction packed adventure filled episode.\n\n625\n00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:12,771\nSo stay tuned, and\nwe will be back after these messages.\n\n626\n00:32:12,771 --> 00:32:16,935\n[NOISE] All right,\n\n627\n00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:23,049\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n628\n00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:26,480\nSo let's talk about a couple of\nother things that are out there.\n\n629\n00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,400\nI mentioned how offline file access\nis kind of going away thanks to\n\n630\n00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,710\npeople's connectivity,\nconnectedness, or whatever.\n\n631\n00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,960\nThat you have wireless Connections\ndarn near everywhere now.\n\n632\n00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,145\nSo you're never truly\noffline like you used to be.\n\n633\n00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:46,823\nSo we have a couple other things that\nkinda take the place of what offline\n\n634\n00:32:46,823 --> 00:32:47,510\nfiles does.\n\n635\n00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,800\nAnd the first thing that\ncomes to my mind is SkyDrive.\n\n636\n00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,500\nWe have SkyDrive built into Windows 8.\n\n637\n00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,120\nWell, now,\ncorrect me here if I'm wrong, Nate.\n\n638\n00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,960\nThe SkyDrive client that's built into\nWindows 8, it's actually pretty basic.\n\n639\n00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,090\nAnd then you can download SkyDrive Pro,\nright?\n\n640\n00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,070\nAnd that's when yo get the full set?\n\n641\n00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:09,360\n>> SkyDrive Pro that's\npart of a bigger thing.\n\n642\n00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,390\nBut yeah, you can download the SkyDrive\ndesktop app and you have to go that route.\n\n643\n00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,460\n>> So, with Skydrive,\nwhen you log into Windows 8,\n\n644\n00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,908\nit gives you the opportunity to link\nyour Live.com or your Microsoft or\n\n645\n00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:27,870\nHotmail or Outlook.com or\nwhatever account with your laptop.\n\n646\n00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,130\nAnd when you do that, there's certain\nthings that are synchronized between your\n\n647\n00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,590\nlaptop and the cloud.\n\n648\n00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,310\nAnything you store in the SkyDrive\nis a part of that cloud service.\n\n649\n00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,890\nIt synchronized down to your machine so\nit's available when you're offline or\n\n650\n00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,520\nonline.\n\n651\n00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,760\nAnd it synchronizes for you.\n\n652\n00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,950\nSo it's all kind of\nautomatic which is nice.\n\n653\n00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,900\nAlso, things like your desktop wallpaper\nand that gets synchronized up.\n\n654\n00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:57,060\nWhen you purchase apps from the Windows\nstore, that gets synchronized up.\n\n655\n00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,000\nSo, a lot of that is being taken\ncare of automatically for us,\n\n656\n00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,630\njust as a part of having\nthat link to count.\n\n657\n00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,934\n>> [LAUGH] I just have to tell ya,\n>> It's funny because you're going off\n\n658\n00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:11,292\non SkyDrive and on my little list,\nthe next one was power policies.\n\n659\n00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:14,420\nI'm like how is this going\nto turn into power policies?\n\n660\n00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,170\n>> Oh it's not.\n\n661\n00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,100\nIs my list different than yours?\n\n662\n00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,650\n>> And yeah, I looked down on the list and\nyeah, that was funny.\n\n663\n00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,078\nYeah, sync settings, yeah.\n\n664\n00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:25,080\nSkyDrive.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n665\n00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,650\n>> Now, with Windows 8,\n\n666\n00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:32,610\nright, you can sync\nsettings between computers.\n\n667\n00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,370\nIt requires a Microsoft live account.\n\n668\n00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,250\nYou have to be logged in\nwith your Microsoft account.\n\n669\n00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,400\nIt's pretty sweet.\n\n670\n00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,930\nI use it between all my devices.\n\n671\n00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,360\nI sync certain settings I\nwould put on my devices.\n\n672\n00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960\nYeah, pretty rad.\n\n673\n00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,760\nAnd, yeah, I mean we can get in there and\nshow the settings.\n\n674\n00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,830\n>> I know for me, and I've said this on\nthe show before, I format my laptop a lot.\n\n675\n00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,515\nAnd so it's kind of nice to format you\nmachine, bring up a new install of Windows\n\n676\n00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:03,330\n8, log in with your Live account and\nyour wallpaper\n\n677\n00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,200\nis back to the way it used to be and\nyour color theme is the way it used to be.\n\n678\n00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,456\nAnd all this stuff kind of carries along.\n\n679\n00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:08,874\nIt's pretty convenient.\n\n680\n00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:16,580\nIf you use the modern UI email client,\nthe email's already set up for you.\n\n681\n00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,820\nSo that stuff is really cool\nit's just already there.\n\n682\n00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,600\nIt's part of the account.\n\n683\n00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,680\nSo you want to demo that, Nate?\n\n684\n00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,550\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n685\n00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,105\nSo on my PC here, right?\n\n686\n00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:31,120\nWe go into our settings,\nthrough the charms bar, and\n\n687\n00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,330\nchange PC settings which is hidden\ndown below my head there and in here,\n\n688\n00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:42,420\nright, we have-\n>> Sync your settings.\n\n689\n00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,890\n>> Sync settings.\n\n690\n00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,892\nAll right, now up here at the top right,\nwe can just turn the sync on or\n\n691\n00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:48,720\noff, right.\n\n692\n00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,198\nJust shut the, shut the whole thing down.\n\n693\n00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:55,130\nAnd of course, we can also turn it off\nthrough policy if we didn't want employees\n\n694\n00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,950\ngetting on to it and that sort of thing.\n\n695\n00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:02,254\n[INAUDIBLE] Pretty straightforward,\nright, like Don said,\n\n696\n00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:07,410\ndesktop, theme colors and\nthose sort of things.\n\n697\n00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:12,580\nOne thing that is pretty sweet is\nthe option here for the passwords.\n\n698\n00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,700\nNow we can sync passwords\nacross your devices.\n\n699\n00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,940\nHowever, you have to trust this PC.\n\n700\n00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,440\nAnd there is a little hyperlink.\n\n701\n00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,060\nIt'll take you to Microsoft.com.\n\n702\n00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,530\nYou'll have to login\nwith your live account.\n\n703\n00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,790\nAnd it'll give you a code and\nyou'll enter that in to trust the PC and\n\n704\n00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,760\nit will link that feature there.\n\n705\n00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,560\nI haven't done it on this one\nbecause I don't really want it.\n\n706\n00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,464\nYeah, your app settings and browser,\n\n707\n00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:45,230\nnow the sync browser settings,\nthat's for Internet Explorer.\n\n708\n00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:45,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n709\n00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,760\nchrome has its own kind\nof sync settings and so\n\n710\n00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,630\nthe browser should I guess say Internet.\n\n711\n00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,520\n>> Your bookmarks, your homepage, and\nall that, for Internet Explorer, and\n\n712\n00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,890\nWindows 8 comes with Internet Explorer\n10 so it's really an IE 10 thing.\n\n713\n00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:07,710\n>> Yep, and then down at the bottom is\none of the more important ones to keep in\n\n714\n00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,630\nmind, and\nthat is sync over metered connections.\n\n715\n00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,910\nNow, a metered connection\nis a wireless connection\n\n716\n00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,570\nthat you pay for per bandwidth,\nor some kind of payment plan.\n\n717\n00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:26,032\nAnd this is for like wireless broadband\nair cards, things of that sort.\n\n718\n00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:31,050\nAnd if you're paying or\nyou have a limited bandwidth,\n\n719\n00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,000\na data cap, which I think most of them do.\n\n720\n00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,660\nBy chance if you're syncing a lot\nof things in the background\n\n721\n00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,300\nit can really blow through\nthat cap pretty quick.\n\n722\n00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,990\nAnd so\n\n723\n00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,800\nyou have to option to turn it off when\nthe computer is on a metered connection.\n\n724\n00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,870\nAnd the earlier episodes that we've done,\nwe can see how we can set\n\n725\n00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,260\ncertain networks as a costed network.\n\n726\n00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,530\nCosted, metered,\nkind of the same sort of thing.\n\n727\n00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,032\nAnd so we can shut that off and\n\n728\n00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:05,540\nkeep that stuff from syncing\nover those mobile broadbands.\n\n729\n00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,330\n>> Real handy if you're on a MiFi or\ntethering to a cellphone,\n\n730\n00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:13,290\ncuz you don't wanna run Windows updates\nwhen you're on your cell phone.\n\n731\n00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:18,290\nYou don't want to synchronize your entire\nSkyDrive, it can be a lot of data.\n\n732\n00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,440\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n733\n00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,000\nThe sync settings here, they're really\nneat, if you're leveraging SkyDrive.\n\n734\n00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,370\nThat all kinda gets tied into this too.\n\n735\n00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,290\nSo now you're talking about your\nsettings on the computer, and\n\n736\n00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,450\nyour files, all being\nsynchronized to a cloud location.\n\n737\n00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,200\nVery convenient, and for\na home user, or a personal user,\n\n738\n00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,230\nit kind of kills the need for\nthe offline file access.\n\n739\n00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:44,080\nFor a business user, though, where you\nmight not be using live.com accounts,\n\n740\n00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,350\nwhere you're using domain accounts,\nand you've got file servers at work,\n\n741\n00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,470\nthat's where the offline files\ncome in handy as opposed to this.\n\n742\n00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,598\nOr VPNs.\nOther types of connectivity are in there.\n\n743\n00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:54,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n744\n00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,130\n>> So.\n>> Yeah.\n\n745\n00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,810\n>> All right.\nNate,\n\n746\n00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,520\nI think that's really all we needed\nto go into on sync settings.\n\n747\n00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,240\nCan you think of anything else?\n\n748\n00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,460\n>> Nope.\n>> I see what I did.\n\n749\n00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,250\nWe went a little out of order and\ndid Windows To Go first.\n\n750\n00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,810\nAnd in our checklist,\nsync options is right after Windows To Go.\n\n751\n00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,315\nBut we did skip right over power policies.\n\n752\n00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:13,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So.\n\n753\n00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,660\nLet's go back in time.\n\n754\n00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,560\n>> Mm hm.\n>> And pretend like we're\n\n755\n00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,070\ncoming right back from the segment and\ngo into Windows power settings.\n\n756\n00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,310\n>> Are you going to bring us in?\n\n757\n00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,200\n>> So, why don't you do it this time?\n\n758\n00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:23,933\n>> Welcome.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n759\n00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:25,463\n>> And power policies,\n\n760\n00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:30,980\nright, so with our, I guess,\nmobile theme across all the stuff.\n\n761\n00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,660\nPower policies.\n\n762\n00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,920\nWe want to squeeze the most\nas we can out of our laptops.\n\n763\n00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,770\n>> Our batteries.\n\n764\n00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,336\n>> Our batteries.\n\n765\n00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:43,420\nPower policies, set these up if you're\ngoing on a long plane ride, right.\n\n766\n00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,680\nYou want to squeeze the most\nyou can out of that PC.\n\n767\n00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,050\nYou can change with power policies, right?\n\n768\n00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,558\nWhether your PC or\nthe CPU's running at full speed,\n\n769\n00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:58,375\nwhether the fans kick on all the time.\n\n770\n00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:01,167\nYeah, it's just a menagerie\nof settings here.\n\n771\n00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:06,042\nIf you are plugged in, you're at\nthe office Or you have a very short trip.\n\n772\n00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:10,550\nYou can ramp your CPU up all the way and\nlet those fans kick on.\n\n773\n00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,720\nBrightness turned all the way up, and\n\n774\n00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,790\nset profiles to where you can switch\nbetween different power savings.\n\n775\n00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:21,140\n>> And this is something that we see in\nalmost all laptop devices that are out\n\n776\n00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,990\nthere, and you don't see it in desktops.\n\n777\n00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,560\nSo, in laptop hardwares, for example,\nif you have an Intel processor,\n\n778\n00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,078\nyou may have Intel SpeedStep.\n\n779\n00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:29,279\nIntel SpeedStep.\n\n780\n00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:32,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Intel SpeedStep, if I can say it,\n\n781\n00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,630\njeez that shouldn't be so hard.\n\n782\n00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,640\nYou might have a four gigahertz\nprocessor in your computer.\n\n783\n00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,340\nBut do you need it running\nat 4 gigahertz all the time?\n\n784\n00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:40,930\nNo.\n\n785\n00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:44,691\nSo Intel Speedstep says hey when you're\nnot busy let's slow that down to two\n\n786\n00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:46,590\ngigahertz or one gigahertz, right.\n\n787\n00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:50,670\nSo it's something slower so it consumes\nless power and our battery runs longer.\n\n788\n00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,050\nIf you have AMD CPU's then you probably\nhave AMD Cool and Quiet, right.\n\n789\n00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,090\nSame idea.\n\n790\n00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,880\nThat it can slow down the processors which\ngenerates less heat which means it can\n\n791\n00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,190\nslow down the fans.\n\n792\n00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:07,320\nIt makes the system cooler and\nquieter when you're not doing high math or\n\n793\n00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,220\nplaying video games, or whatever it is you\ndo when the laptop racks up that usage.\n\n794\n00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,440\nSo these things,\nthey've got to be managed.\n\n795\n00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,960\nThey've got to be managed by software,\nand Windows has that support.\n\n796\n00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,140\nIt can communicate with the processor.\n\n797\n00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,650\nWe can be able to tell it when it can\nstep down, when it can use the step up.\n\n798\n00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,670\nYou mentioned the screen brightness.\n\n799\n00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,600\nOn our laptop, it's a little frustrating,\nbecause Windows 8 can mean as a screen\n\n800\n00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,530\nbrightness and the Dell laptop hardware\ncan manage the screen brightness, and\n\n801\n00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,710\nsometimes they get out of sync.\n\n802\n00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,550\nSo, one might say that your\nscreen's at 100% brightness and\n\n803\n00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,550\nthe other says it's at 50%.\n\n804\n00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,440\nBut the brightness of your screen,\n\n805\n00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,990\nthat's really one of the big\nconsumers of battery in your system.\n\n806\n00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:50,150\nThat keeping that screen lit up,\ncasting that light, takes a lot of power.\n\n807\n00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,570\nSo if you dim your screen down,\na lot of times,\n\n808\n00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:55,030\nyou can still read everything just fine.\n\n809\n00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,145\nBut it's now consuming less power, right?\n\n810\n00:41:57,145 --> 00:41:58,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n811\n00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,200\nYeah, and there's, I guess, kind of like\nthree levels of your power policies.\n\n812\n00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,800\n>> Mm hm.\n\n813\n00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,630\n>> Right?\n\n814\n00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,260\nAnd now we can go through\n>> Yeah, let's take a look at them.\n\n815\n00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,750\n>> Mhm.\nGet some of those on.\n\n816\n00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,250\nOn my PC here right,\ndown in the very bottom corner,\n\n817\n00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:21,050\nnext to that little keyboard icon,\nis the battery icon and\n\n818\n00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:25,960\nthat's where I go to to get\ninto the power options.\n\n819\n00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,700\n>> We couldn't see it.\n\n820\n00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,820\nCan we get that full-screen?\n\n821\n00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,550\nJust when you're on a PC you don't see it.\n\n822\n00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,780\nBut on a laptop,\nI mean on a desktop you don't see it, but\n\n823\n00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,850\non a laptop there's that little battery,\nand\n\n824\n00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,955\nif you're plugged in it's got\na power plug on it like Nate's did.\n\n825\n00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:40,525\nIf you're not plugged in,\n\n826\n00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:43,615\nthen it's just the battery and\nit will show that it's depleting.\n\n827\n00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:50,770\n>> Now this, so this right here would be\nlike the first level of our power options.\n\n828\n00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,890\nPre-configured plans.\n\n829\n00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,950\nAnd we go through and\njust set quick settings.\n\n830\n00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,680\nI leave mine on high performance.\n\n831\n00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,390\nI want to get the most out of this\nlittle guy running all the time.\n\n832\n00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,130\nWe have a power saver.\n\n833\n00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,120\nIt shuts, of course they're all\nkind of configured we'll get into\n\n834\n00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,060\nthat in the second one,\nsecond little level.\n\n835\n00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,360\nNow, we can change these.\n\n836\n00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,330\nSo on the high performance we\ncan change our plan settings.\n\n837\n00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,740\nThis is like the second\nlevel of going into things.\n\n838\n00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:28,960\nWe can set what it does when it's on\nthe battery and when it's plugged in.\n\n839\n00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,440\nDim, turning off the display,\nthe sleep time.\n\n840\n00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,910\nAnd there is yet another one, another\nlevel, change advanced power settings.\n\n841\n00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:46,845\nAnd going into there is a more\ngranular way to set some things.\n\n842\n00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:49,635\nNow, here, I cannot change this.\n\n843\n00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:51,510\nSo it will require a password on wake-up.\n\n844\n00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,695\nCannot.\nNow, to change these,\n\n845\n00:43:53,695 --> 00:43:56,165\nyou do have to have administrative access.\n\n846\n00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:58,015\nJust up here at the top,\nthe little shield.\n\n847\n00:43:58,015 --> 00:44:00,045\nChange settings that\nare currently unavailable,\n\n848\n00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:02,220\nwhich is just about all of them.\n\n849\n00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,165\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And a few in here to\n\n850\n00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:10,268\nmake note the wireless adapter\nsettings in the Power Saving mode.\n\n851\n00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:17,550\nYeah, you can set it to where the power\ngoes to the wireless adapter.\n\n852\n00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,010\nYou get a good, strong signal.\n\n853\n00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,280\nMaximum performance.\n\n854\n00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,720\nYou can lower that down to\nsave a little bit of power.\n\n855\n00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,305\n>> It's not a significant amount but\nyou do save a little.\n\n856\n00:44:27,305 --> 00:44:29,205\n>> Mm-mm, yep.\n\n857\n00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:35,890\nYeah goodness the display ones right,\nhere's a real fun one here.\n\n858\n00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,980\nAdaptive brightness.\n\n859\n00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:44,750\nDepending on the ambient light around,\nit will just set your brightness for you.\n\n860\n00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,550\nI find it real annoying.\n\n861\n00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,310\n>> I do too.\n\n862\n00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,270\n>> One of the first\nthings that I shut off.\n\n863\n00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,550\n>> Almost every laptop has hardware\nkeys right on the keyboard where\n\n864\n00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,780\nyou can increase or\ndecrease the brightness.\n\n865\n00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,690\nThe auto brightness gets really\nfrustrating because the sun can peek\n\n866\n00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,260\nthrough a cloud or whatever, and\nall of a sudden you can't see your screen.\n\n867\n00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,160\nAnd the sun goes behind the cloud, but\nthe screen has already gone too dim, and\n\n868\n00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,680\nnow you can't see it anyway.\n\n869\n00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,515\nAnd so you just end up in a lose-lose\nsituation, so I always disable that one.\n\n870\n00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:16,150\n>> And some other ones to point out.\n\n871\n00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,500\nThe critical battery levels.\n\n872\n00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,690\nLike driving in a car, you have your\nlittle gas light that comes on like,\n\n873\n00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,030\nyou better stop and get some gas.\n\n874\n00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,680\nWell, you can set that on your PC here.\n\n875\n00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,560\nHere at critical battery level,\nI have mine set on 5%.\n\n876\n00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:40,150\nIt gets down to 5% and it's going to power\ndown, and leave that last little bit.\n\n877\n00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,550\nWe can set the notifications\non when we get there.\n\n878\n00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:50,168\nSo, on this one at 10%, it'll pop up and\nsay, hey your battery is getting low.\n\n879\n00:45:50,168 --> 00:45:54,340\nAnd at 5%, it's gonna say\nokay I am really, really low.\n\n880\n00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:59,315\nI'm about to power down,\nsave your work and then I guess you have\n\n881\n00:45:59,315 --> 00:46:02,875\na couple of percentage if you had to\nfire it back up and do something.\n\n882\n00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:05,125\nYou've got that little\nbit of reserve in there.\n\n883\n00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:10,125\n>> So those are some of\nthe things that are in there.\n\n884\n00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:12,560\nI wanna show you something\na little anecdotal.\n\n885\n00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,440\nHere, I'm remoting into\nthe other Windows 8 machine.\n\n886\n00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,360\nSo I want to show you guys\nthe default power policy.\n\n887\n00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,660\nLet me get this pulled up here.\n\n888\n00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:26,810\nWhy is it not finding, oh there we go.\n\n889\n00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,470\nOkay.\nHere we go.\n\n890\n00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,800\nOn a brand new computer,\nwhen you fire it up,\n\n891\n00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,760\nthese are the default power\noptions that you're gonna see.\n\n892\n00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,880\nWhen you go in you'll see preferred plans,\nyou'll see balanced and power saver,\n\n893\n00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,240\nthose are my choices right?\n\n894\n00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,830\nNow this is a desktop PC I'm in so\nsee how power savers greyed out?\n\n895\n00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,010\nA laptop would have that, but a desktop\nwon't because there's not much that they\n\n896\n00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:52,460\ncan do, but under show additional plans,\nthat's where we've got high performance.\n\n897\n00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:58,200\nThat's the one where it's ratcheted up\nto the highest level of performance,\n\n898\n00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,970\nand see how it was hidden?\n\n899\n00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,580\nA lot of people have asked\nabout why is that hidden?\n\n900\n00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,840\nThe screen is obviously big enough to\ndisplay all three, why do we hide it?\n\n901\n00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,720\nAll right, well Microsoft did this as\npart of their going green initiative.\n\n902\n00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,310\nAnd what they did is they\ndid a research study, and\n\n903\n00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:16,210\nmost people will never\nhit that down arrow.\n\n904\n00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:19,800\nAnd so they found that by hiding it,\nthe majority of users would stick\n\n905\n00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,800\nwith the balanced plan over power\nsaver and they wouldn't leave it.\n\n906\n00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,560\nSo more people would stay with balanced,\nwhich resulted in an energy savings.\n\n907\n00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,510\nIf people saw high performance,\npeople would choose it.\n\n908\n00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,920\nWell obviously I want high performance,\nI want my system to run great and\n\n909\n00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,320\nso that's the reason they hide it,\nand they actually cite that.\n\n910\n00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,270\nMicrosoft does this like environmental\nreport every year, and, so\n\n911\n00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:48,590\nthey cite millions of kilowatt hours saved\nbecause of that one thing right there.\n\n912\n00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,792\nIt's actually, that's a true story.\n\n913\n00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:53,835\nSo as you start to add\nmore policies to this,\n\n914\n00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:58,115\nyou will always have your current one and\nyour last used one and\n\n915\n00:47:58,115 --> 00:48:03,000\nevery other policy will be down here\nunder the Hide Additional Plans.\n\n916\n00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,900\nAnd so you may have more that get\ntucked away under there as you start to\n\n917\n00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,500\ncreate them.\n\n918\n00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,417\nAnd you'll get them in there, right.\n\n919\n00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:11,960\nBut, flipping between them is really easy,\nI do it on my own machine.\n\n920\n00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,580\nLet me go back to my machine.\n\n921\n00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,120\nI do it on my own machine\nbefore every show.\n\n922\n00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,950\nSee how I've got balanced and\nthen I've got show.\n\n923\n00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,790\nSo when I'm about to go on the air\nI flip over to the show policy,\n\n924\n00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,080\nbecause I don't want my laptop\nto go to sleep during the show.\n\n925\n00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,130\nAnd I want my brightness adjusted, so\n\n926\n00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,640\nthat you guys don't see a reflection\non my shirt of the laptop screen.\n\n927\n00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,490\nSo I have that all defined, and\nI flip to it, and, at the end of the day,\n\n928\n00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,620\nwhen the shows are over.\n\n929\n00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,080\nI go back to balance I flip over to that,\nand then I head home.\n\n930\n00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,790\nSo it is pretty easy to float back and\nforth.\n\n931\n00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,910\nAnd people make little widgets\nthat can easily flip and stuff.\n\n932\n00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,330\nI've seen quite a few different things.\n\n933\n00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,670\n>> That leads into the last little\nbit I had on power policies,\n\n934\n00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:57,610\nis that you can create your\nown power policy plan.\n\n935\n00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:05,090\nAnd create your plan, and then use a\npolicy setting to enforce that power plan.\n\n936\n00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:09,600\nIf your organization has\na bunch of laptops rolling out,\n\n937\n00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,740\nand they're going green or something.\n\n938\n00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,270\n>> Then you can create a custom power\nplan, you know, for that organisation, and\n\n939\n00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:21,790\nthen use policy settings to\nenforce that on those laptops.\n\n940\n00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,650\nAnd, you know,\nyou need administrative access to,\n\n941\n00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,460\nyou know, change anything of it.\n\n942\n00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,040\nAnd, yeah, so\nyou can enforce those that way.\n\n943\n00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,750\n>> You know,\nI was involved in a project out in Seattle\n\n944\n00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,470\n>> Seattle, very\n\n945\n00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,180\nenvironmentally conscious out there.\n\n946\n00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,890\nAnd I worked for a bank, so\n\n947\n00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:40,700\nwe had thousands of PCs across four\nstates, and we created a power policy.\n\n948\n00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,160\nWe pushed out just like that.\n\n949\n00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,020\nAnd we had mandatory sleep times.\n\n950\n00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,840\nAnd so\n\n951\n00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,640\nwe would basically send out a bullet at,\nif I remember right, it was 8 P.M..\n\n952\n00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,940\nNow our bank branches would close\nat 6 P.M., but people stay late,\n\n953\n00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,220\nthey work, whatever.\n\n954\n00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,160\nAnd so at 8 P.M.,\n\n955\n00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,090\nwe'd send out a bullet to the branches\nto make the machines go to sleep.\n\n956\n00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,130\nAnd so we'd force them to go to sleep, but\n\n957\n00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,810\nthen at 6 A.M.,\nwe'd wake them all up again.\n\n958\n00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,580\nAnd that way when people\ncame came in in the morning,\n\n959\n00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,210\ntheir machine was already awake and\nready to go for them.\n\n960\n00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,120\nBut if they didn't use it by,\nI think it was, 9 A.M.,\n\n961\n00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,040\nthe machines would go back to sleep.\n\n962\n00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,330\nSo we really controlled that and it made a\nnoticeable difference on the power bills.\n\n963\n00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,440\nYou could actually see it was,\nit wasn't gigantic,\n\n964\n00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,150\nit was a good $30, $35 a month that\nwe were saving in each Branch.\n\n965\n00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:30,310\nBut when you've got a hundred branches\nthat $35 a month become $3,500 a month.\n\n966\n00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,040\nAnd in a year it can save you\nseveral thousand dollars, you know.\n\n967\n00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,630\nSo for corporations,\nthey can really get a noticeable savings.\n\n968\n00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:43,700\nFor a home user you're talking maybe $4 or\n$5, over the course of a year.\n\n969\n00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,490\nNot a significant amount.\n\n970\n00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:50,230\nBut think globally, act locally,\nisn't that what the script says?\n\n971\n00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,920\nSo just keep that in mind,\neverybody has to do their part.\n\n972\n00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,630\n>> Mm.\n\n973\n00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,260\nYeah.\n\n974\n00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,815\n>> That's my hippy message of the day.\n\n975\n00:50:57,815 --> 00:50:58,790\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n976\n00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:59,450\nSweet, thanks Tom.\n\n977\n00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,290\n>> Yep, I try.\n\n978\n00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:04,520\n>> AlL right,\nyeah that's all I have on power policies.\n\n979\n00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,280\nAll right.\n\n980\n00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,770\nSo, we've got one more thing under\nmobility options before we get\n\n981\n00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:13,150\ninto security, which is Wi-Fi direct.\n\n982\n00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,350\nRight?\nWe've only got about five minutes left.\n\n983\n00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,800\nI think that's enough time\nto talk about Wi-Fi direct.\n\n984\n00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,670\n>> Plenty.\n>> Wi-Fi direct is a technology\n\n985\n00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,910\nthat was introduced, really for\nmobile devices like phones.\n\n986\n00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,150\nAnd you guys might have seen\nthe Samsung commercials where they have\n\n987\n00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:31,500\nthe Galaxy S3's, and, somebody\nstarts playing a video on one, and\n\n988\n00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,360\nthey touch the phone to another device,\n\n989\n00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,330\nand it starts playing the video\n>> And then they touch it to a third one,\n\n990\n00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,110\nand it starts playing the video.\n\n991\n00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:41,320\nWell, what that's doing, is it's using\na technology called wi-fi direct,\n\n992\n00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,530\nand Windows 8 supports it also.\n\n993\n00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:47,390\nThe idea is that,\nit's actually two types of communications.\n\n994\n00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:51,430\nFirst off, you have NFC,\nnear field communications.\n\n995\n00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:54,070\nWhen they tap those\ndevices in the commercial,\n\n996\n00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,680\nIt's bringing their NFC\nantennas close together.\n\n997\n00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,160\nNFC's got an effective range of, it's\nlike six inches or something isn't it?\n\n998\n00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,840\nIt's really short.\n\n999\n00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,730\n>> Really short.\n\n1000\n00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,340\n>> And,\nwhen you touch those machines together\n\n1001\n00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,610\n>> They communicate and\n\n1002\n00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:09,080\nthey exchange a security key, all right?\n\n1003\n00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,570\nAnd, that key basically says, all right,\nwe're gonna start up an ad hoc wireless\n\n1004\n00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:19,570\nnetwork, over the 802.11a,b,g,n,\nace c, whatever card it is you got.\n\n1005\n00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:22,050\nIt's gonna create an ad\nhoc wireless network, and\n\n1006\n00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,720\nhere's the security key we're\ngonna use on that network.\n\n1007\n00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,290\nAnd then, you're device and\nthe device you ta[[ed.\n\n1008\n00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,700\nWill reach out to each other\nover their wireless card, and\n\n1009\n00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,400\nestablish a secured, high speed connection\nfor copying files and other things.\n\n1010\n00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,810\nYou can copy contacts,\nyou can play movies and videos.\n\n1011\n00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,810\nYou can do all sorts of crazy\nstuff over Wi-Fi direct.\n\n1012\n00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:43,420\nThe problem is really two-fold.\n\n1013\n00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,610\nFirst, it was designed for\nmobile devices like cell phones, and so\n\n1014\n00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:50,970\nMicrosoft is kind of retrofitting\nWindows to work with it.\n\n1015\n00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,770\nThe second thing is it requires NFC,\nwhich most laptops don't have.\n\n1016\n00:52:55,770 --> 00:53:01,000\nAnd so the implementation of\nWi-Fi Direct in Windows 8 is,\n\n1017\n00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,440\nto quote the TechNet postings,\nit's half-baked.\n\n1018\n00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,560\nRight?\nIt's not really fully developed yet.\n\n1019\n00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,490\nAnd we'll see that change as\nWindows 8 continues to evolve, and\n\n1020\n00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,080\nWindows 9 and so on.\n\n1021\n00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,550\nIt is really cool that you can just take\ntwo devices and quickly sync them up and\n\n1022\n00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,910\nstart copying data between them,\nwithout setting up a network,\n\n1023\n00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,590\nwithout setting up a home group.\n\n1024\n00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,400\nYou know.\nAnd just doing that right there through\n\n1025\n00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,620\nthe manual settings.\n\n1026\n00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,050\nBut it is not very stable.\n\n1027\n00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,460\nNate and I have actually tried to\ndo a transfer between our systems.\n\n1028\n00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,080\nIt did not end well.\n\n1029\n00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,420\nBut I do it all the time\nbetween cell phones.\n\n1030\n00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,470\nMy wife and I,\nwe both have Android phones, and\n\n1031\n00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,980\nwe use Wi-Fi Direct between\nour phones all the time.\n\n1032\n00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,920\nIt's a great technology,\n\n1033\n00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,960\nit's just still coming over from\nthe phone world into the desktop world.\n\n1034\n00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,295\nSo we'll see more out of it\nprobably over the next year.\n\n1035\n00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:51,840\n>> Mm-hm, yeah,\n\n1036\n00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,640\nand there are third-party apps that\ntake advantage of the Wi-Fi Direct.\n\n1037\n00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,660\nIntel.\n\n1038\n00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:02,190\nIntel has their own\nlittle program that runs,\n\n1039\n00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,370\nit can build those Wi-Fi\ndirect connections.\n\n1040\n00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:10,710\nNow for Windows 8,\nto connect to a wireless\n\n1041\n00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:14,900\ndirect connection,\nis done through the PC settings.\n\n1042\n00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,580\nAnd you know what?\n\n1043\n00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,150\nI can show you on my PC here.\n\n1044\n00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:23,201\nAnd in the PC Settings.\n\n1045\n00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:31,080\nThere is over on devices, this is\nwhere you would go to connect it up.\n\n1046\n00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,790\nNow down here I've turned\nit on on my cell phone,\n\n1047\n00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:38,850\nyou know the little WUD for\nThe Wi-Fi direct.\n\n1048\n00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,630\nAnd you just click on, add a device.\n\n1049\n00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:45,530\nAnd this will reach out and\nlook for those devices.\n\n1050\n00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,360\nIt will appear in the list.\n\n1051\n00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,290\nAnd, yeah.\n\n1052\n00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:52,140\nThat's how you would build those\nconnections through Windows 8, now.\n\n1053\n00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,835\nI have paired it to my phone,\nand they do talk to each other.\n\n1054\n00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:59,660\n[LAUGH] But\nwhenever I try to send something across.\n\n1055\n00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,600\nThen it connects,\nit calls the thing offline.\n\n1056\n00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,190\nI messed with it a bit yesterday.\n\n1057\n00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:10,620\nI really couldn't get it to work past\n\n1058\n00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,250\nseeing each other, and\njust that initial connection.\n\n1059\n00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,980\n>> And that's gonna be a Android phone,\n\n1060\n00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,850\nWindows desktop, the compatibility\n>> Kind of flaky.\n\n1061\n00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,915\nIt might work just fine on a Windows\nphone, but none of us have one to test.\n\n1062\n00:55:22,915 --> 00:55:24,197\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1063\n00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:27,320\n>> So, if you're from Microsoft out there,\nsend us a Windows phone.\n\n1064\n00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,000\nWe'll try it out.\n\n1065\n00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,680\nBut, yeah, none of us are taking\nthe two year plunge yet.\n\n1066\n00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,042\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, [LAUGH].\n\n1067\n00:55:33,042 --> 00:55:36,280\n>> Yeah, it is an emerging technology.\n\n1068\n00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:36,980\nReally sweet.\n\n1069\n00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:42,150\nIt will be a really fast,\nnice way to transfer stuff back and forth.\n\n1070\n00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:46,670\nI'll be excited,\nwhen it starts rolling out hardcore.\n\n1071\n00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,165\n>> Things to remember for the exam.\n\n1072\n00:55:48,165 --> 00:55:50,900\nWi-Fi direct, lets you quickly and\neasily copy files, and\n\n1073\n00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,890\nother things between two systems,\nafter they exchange a secure key,\n\n1074\n00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,150\nand they establish that\nconnection via wireless.\n\n1075\n00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,080\n>> It is secure.\n\n1076\n00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:02,000\nIt does use an adhoc wireless\nconnection to transfer the data.\n\n1077\n00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,544\nIt does not use NFC to transfer the data.\n\n1078\n00:56:04,544 --> 00:56:07,292\nNFC is just used for\nexchanging that security key.\n\n1079\n00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:08,750\nAnd that's it.\n\n1080\n00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,292\nSo, everything else done\nstraight over the wireless.\n\n1081\n00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:13,161\nIt was nice and fast.\n\n1082\n00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1083\n00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:15,100\nYeah.\n>> All right, well on that note.\n\n1084\n00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,530\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n1085\n00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:21,080\nWe've got our security\nstuff coming up next.\n\n1086\n00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,550\nI mentioned BitLocker at the very\nbeginning of the episode.\n\n1087\n00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,110\nSo we are gonna take a look at that.\n\n1088\n00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:30,900\nAnd we also have some other cool\nremote GPS stuff to tackle.\n\n1089\n00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,290\nSo that's what's coming up next.\n\n1090\n00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,630\nGot anything else to throw\nin before the break?\n\n1091\n00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:35,282\n>> I'm good.\n\n1092\n00:56:35,282 --> 00:56:42,450\n>> All right so ladies and gentlemen,\nstay tuned, we'll be back in a minute.\n\n1093\n00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:47,372\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1094\n00:56:47,372 --> 00:56:51,734\nSo, back at the beginning of the episode,\nwhen I installed Windows To Go on my USB\n\n1095\n00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:56,161\ndrive, it asked if I wanted to turn on\nBitLocker, and I said I'm gonna skip that,\n\n1096\n00:56:56,161 --> 00:56:58,720\nwe're gonna talk about it later.\n\n1097\n00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,880\nWell, we are now at that point.\n\n1098\n00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,510\n>> All right.\n>> Let's talk about BitLocker.\n\n1099\n00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:04,270\nBitLocker is not new.\n\n1100\n00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,930\nIt was introduced with Windows Vista,\nbut it has been refined quite a bit.\n\n1101\n00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:13,180\nChanged in Windows 7 and changed again in\nWindows 8 to make it a little easier and\n\n1102\n00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,380\na little more flexible for\neverybody to use.\n\n1103\n00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,160\nThe restrictions and\n\n1104\n00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,400\nthings that were on it in Windows Vista\nmade it not a very attractive solution.\n\n1105\n00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,790\nBut the way it's deployed today\nis actually very powerful.\n\n1106\n00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:26,460\nSo what is BitLocker?\n\n1107\n00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,980\nWell, if someone wants to break into\nmy laptop and get at my data right?\n\n1108\n00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,010\nIf they turn on my laptop they've got to\nlog in, they've got to put a username and\n\n1109\n00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:34,520\npassword.\n\n1110\n00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,505\nThey've got to be able\nto get into the system.\n\n1111\n00:57:36,505 --> 00:57:38,330\nOtherwise, they can't log in.\n\n1112\n00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,490\nBut, they could just\nrip out my hard drive,\n\n1113\n00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:45,190\nstick my hard drive in their\ncomputer as a second hard drive.\n\n1114\n00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:49,445\nAnd when they do that, now they can\njust browse into the hard drive,\n\n1115\n00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:50,795\nseize ownership of the files, and\n\n1116\n00:57:50,795 --> 00:57:53,615\nthey've got access to all my data\nwithout knowing my password.\n\n1117\n00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:54,195\nAll right?\n\n1118\n00:57:54,195 --> 00:57:55,345\nThat's a big deal.\n\n1119\n00:57:55,345 --> 00:57:58,745\nIf you're handling sensitive data, medical\nrecords, financial information, and\n\n1120\n00:57:58,745 --> 00:58:03,020\nyour laptop gets stolen, you have\nto consider that data compromised.\n\n1121\n00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:08,410\nSo what Bitlocker allows us to do, is it\nallows us to encrypt an entire hard drive.\n\n1122\n00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,130\nNot like EFS.\n\n1123\n00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:12,700\nEFS is designed for\na handful of files or folders.\n\n1124\n00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,390\nBitLocker lets us encrypt the whole thing.\n\n1125\n00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,460\nNot just our internal hard drives,\nbut our removal drives also.\n\n1126\n00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:23,610\nWe have BitLocker and we have\nBitLocker to go or BitLocker mobile,\n\n1127\n00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,490\nwhat's the official name?\n\n1128\n00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,700\n>> Bitlocker to go.\n\n1129\n00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,620\n>> Bitlocker to go, all right,\njust like Windows to go.\n\n1130\n00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,810\nSo we can encrypt our mobile devices\nto our removable devices too.\n\n1131\n00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:35,430\nSo you leave that USB key on a cab,\nnot a big deal.\n\n1132\n00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,832\nIt's encrypted, your data is safe.\n\n1133\n00:58:37,832 --> 00:58:43,410\n>> Yep, and BitLocker, right,\nyou have whole-drive encryption.\n\n1134\n00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:49,690\nYou can encrypt your C Drive\nright where Windows is.\n\n1135\n00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:52,200\nIf you have multiple hard\ndrives in your computer,\n\n1136\n00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,200\nyou can also encrypt those drives as well.\n\n1137\n00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,840\n>> So when I installed Windows To Go on\nthat removable hard drive, it was asking,\n\n1138\n00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,540\ndo I want to turn on BitLocker To Go.\n\n1139\n00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:07,190\nAnd if I had checked yes, I would have\nhad to have put in a pass key, right.\n\n1140\n00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:10,850\nAnd then any time I took that hard\ndrive to somebody else's computer and\n\n1141\n00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:15,130\nplugged it in and booted up off of it\nI would have to provide that pass key\n\n1142\n00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,790\nin order to decrypt the contents of\nthe drive and run Windows To Go.\n\n1143\n00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,200\nThat's really handy because if you\nlose that drive with Windows To Go.\n\n1144\n00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,240\nYou're not just losing some files you're\nlosing your whole operating system,\n\n1145\n00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,310\nthe whole shebang.\n\n1146\n00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:29,510\nIf you've got VPN clients on there and\nstuff, you could be basically\n\n1147\n00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,870\ngiving away keys to the kingdom to\naccess back to your corporate network.\n\n1148\n00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,840\nSo it's real import to secure that.\n\n1149\n00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,750\nSo normally I never would have\nskipped past that option.\n\n1150\n00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,170\nI would have said absolutely\nlet's turn it on.\n\n1151\n00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:45,360\nIt does make the install take a lot longer\ncuz it's got to encrypt the drive, but\n\n1152\n00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,070\nit is worth every bit of that,\nmaking sure that data is secure.\n\n1153\n00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:55,460\n>> Yeah, and on my PC here, it dual boots.\n\n1154\n00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:01,740\nI have one partition or volume that I\n\n1155\n01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:06,810\nuse as a daily driver, and I have another\none that I use for here on the show.\n\n1156\n01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,740\nAnd on mine so\n\n1157\n01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:13,205\nthe one I use as a daily driver I have\na BitLocker turned on on that one.\n\n1158\n01:00:13,205 --> 01:00:16,050\nCuz there's a lot of stuff on there,\nthis PC.\n\n1159\n01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:18,930\nIf anything were to happen to it,\n\n1160\n01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:23,900\nI wouldn't want anyone to get my game\ncodes that I worked so hard for.\n\n1161\n01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:29,380\nBut yeah and on my PC here we\ncan skip on over to this one and\n\n1162\n01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,730\nI can show what it would\nlook like here in computer.\n\n1163\n01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,080\nSo here is, right?\n\n1164\n01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,840\nThe Windows installation I use for\nhere on the show.\n\n1165\n01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,610\nAnd then there is the one that\nI use as my daily driver.\n\n1166\n01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:46,798\nAnd here I can't even browse to it,\ncan't open it, do anything with it.\n\n1167\n01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:51,306\nI tried to click on it and it's asking for\n\n1168\n01:00:51,306 --> 01:00:56,625\na 48 digit recovery key\nto unlock that drive.\n\n1169\n01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:59,275\n>> Yeah so that is secured,\nit's protected.\n\n1170\n01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:02,045\nAnd again, if somebody gets physical\naccess to your machine they just add\n\n1171\n01:01:02,045 --> 01:01:03,375\nanother hard drive with their OS.\n\n1172\n01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:07,650\nSo they boot off of a Linux live CD or\nsomething like that.\n\n1173\n01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:10,580\nThey're not going to be able access\nthat drive because it is encrypted.\n\n1174\n01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,480\nIt is a very high level of security.\n\n1175\n01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,470\nI mentioned earlier in the show\nI used to work for a bank.\n\n1176\n01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,900\nWe had one of our bank\nbranches get broken into and\n\n1177\n01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,680\nsomebody stole five\nlaptops from the branch.\n\n1178\n01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,090\nEvery one of those laptops\nhad financial data them.\n\n1179\n01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:27,350\nHad customer account numbers things\nlike that that were on them.\n\n1180\n01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,750\nBut we didn't have to report\nthat as a data theft.\n\n1181\n01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:35,380\nAnd the reason we didn't is those drives\nwere encrypted with a very high level of\n\n1182\n01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,250\nencryption.\n\n1183\n01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,960\nSo even though somebody had the laptops,\n\n1184\n01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:42,100\nall they could really do with it\nis format them, reinstall windows,\n\n1185\n01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,620\nand then sell them on Ebay which is what\nthe data thieves like that normally do.\n\n1186\n01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,990\nWhen they steal those laptops\nthey are not normally going for\n\n1187\n01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:48,810\nthe data that's on them.\n\n1188\n01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:52,220\nThey just want the hardware so\nthey can wipe it and sell it.\n\n1189\n01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:56,310\nSo that's good if your data is\nencrypted you're protected.\n\n1190\n01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,460\nIf the data was unencrypted, even if\nthe data thieves took the laptop and\n\n1191\n01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,830\nformatted it immediately.\n\n1192\n01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:02,830\nWe wouldn't know.\n\n1193\n01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:06,110\nWe would have no confirmation, and\nwe'd have to treat that as a data leak.\n\n1194\n01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,830\nWe have to email all of our customers and\nsay we're sorry,\n\n1195\n01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:10,870\nyour account may have been compromised.\n\n1196\n01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:12,700\nAnd you guys have seen this before.\n\n1197\n01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,300\nWhat do you do?\n\n1198\n01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,225\nAs a company they offer you like,\nthree months of credit monitoring service.\n\n1199\n01:02:17,225 --> 01:02:18,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And what good does that do?\n\n1200\n01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:21,620\nYou basically, all the trouble you're\ngonna think of through cancelling\n\n1201\n01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:24,630\ncredit card numbers and stuff,\nit gets really frustrating.\n\n1202\n01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:27,420\nSo if we can avoid that,\nall the better, right?\n\n1203\n01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,325\nKeeping our data safe.\n\n1204\n01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:30,460\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1205\n01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:34,523\nSo Don, should we run through\nsome BitLocker wizards, and\n\n1206\n01:02:34,523 --> 01:02:36,890\npoint out the [CROSSTALK] options?\n\n1207\n01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,860\n>> Yeah,\nwhat did I do with my little USB drive?\n\n1208\n01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,560\nWell we'll do some BitLocker To Go\non that USB drive I had.\n\n1209\n01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,750\nWhich I stuck some,\noh you know what it's off camera.\n\n1210\n01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,210\nI'm gonna grab it real quick because\nI'll just format that drive and\n\n1211\n01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,660\nwe can throw BitLocker on there and\nget it to seed.\n\n1212\n01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,920\nOr do you have, oh you have a USB key,\nthat's even better!\n\n1213\n01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,560\n>> Mhm.\n\n1214\n01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,280\n>> You got any data on you?\n\n1215\n01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,850\n>> Yes but, it's good.\n\n1216\n01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:56,880\n>> It's salvageable.\n\n1217\n01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,400\n>> Yeah.\n\n1218\n01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,040\nOkay, so let me at, we'll fire this up.\n\n1219\n01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,330\nWe'll use the USB key.\n\n1220\n01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,680\nYou know, the USB key is like,\n\n1221\n01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,716\nNate's got his little one here\non his key chain, really handy.\n\n1222\n01:03:04,716 --> 01:03:09,340\nThis one is what 16 gigs, so\nyou can throw some data on there,\n\n1223\n01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,270\ndocuments whatever, tote them around.\n\n1224\n01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:14,530\nBut if he loses his key chain,\nhe lost his data also, and\n\n1225\n01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,330\nthat can be a really bad thing.\n\n1226\n01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:24,990\nSo what we can do is use\nBitLocker to encrypt that data.\n\n1227\n01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,660\nRight?\n\n1228\n01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,820\nHere I am on my laptop.\n\n1229\n01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:30,510\nAnd I'm going to type in BitLocker and\n\n1230\n01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:35,110\nin my settings I'll see I've got BitLocker\nDrive Encryption and manage BitLocker.\n\n1231\n01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,800\nI'm going to go to\nBitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n1232\n01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,110\nNow what it's going do is it's going to\nlet me enable BitLocker and see how it's\n\n1233\n01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:45,580\ndivided up into two parts, an operating\nsystem drive and removable drives.\n\n1234\n01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,270\nOkay.\n\n1235\n01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:50,300\nIf I start configuring up here,\nthat's regular BitLocker.\n\n1236\n01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,250\nIf I start doing it down here,\nthat's BitLocker To Go.\n\n1237\n01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:57,797\nNow the reason there's a difference,\non most physical computers these\n\n1238\n01:03:57,797 --> 01:04:01,833\ndays you have what's called a TPM,\na trusted platform module.\n\n1239\n01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:07,410\nIt's a chip that's on your motherboard\nthat's designed to store security keys.\n\n1240\n01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,777\nAnd so when you encrypt a hard drive\nthat's like your operating system drive,\n\n1241\n01:04:11,777 --> 01:04:15,710\none of its security keys will be\nstored in the TPM on that system.\n\n1242\n01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:19,065\nAnd if somebody removes the drive,\nthe TPM is no longer present,\n\n1243\n01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:21,080\nyou won't be able to unlock the drive.\n\n1244\n01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,830\nIt's an added layer of security.\n\n1245\n01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:28,500\nSo, the built in BitLocker, the regular\nBitLocker, by default requires a TPM.\n\n1246\n01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,650\nNow you can disable that requirement but\nit is turned on by default.\n\n1247\n01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,875\nIt requires you to have that TPM.\n\n1248\n01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:38,210\nBitLocker To Go on the other hand,\nsays you're gonna have a removal device.\n\n1249\n01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,600\nYou can be moving it from system,\nto system, to system.\n\n1250\n01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,420\nSo even if there is a TPM present,\nit's not gonna have your certificate,\n\n1251\n01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,990\nit's not gonna have your key.\n\n1252\n01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,400\nSo it's not gonna do any good.\n\n1253\n01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,090\nSo BitLocker To Go doesn't use it.\n\n1254\n01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:54,710\n>> Yeah, now it does\nspecifically mention a TPM 1.2,\n\n1255\n01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:59,130\nor version, style, whatever of 1.2.\n\n1256\n01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:04,725\nAll the new BitLockers, or\nthe TPM chips out there are 1.2.\n\n1257\n01:05:04,725 --> 01:05:11,220\nBut it does call it out, that it doesn't\nwork with older TPMs for whatever reason.\n\n1258\n01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,170\n>> And unfortunately it's not\nthe kind of thing you can upgrade.\n\n1259\n01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,230\nThe TPM is hardware on your motherboard.\n\n1260\n01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:21,290\nSo if you've got a TPM 1.0 or 1.1,\nit's not just a flash upgrade to 1.2.\n\n1261\n01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,567\nYou pretty much have to\nbuy a new motherboard.\n\n1262\n01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:27,463\n>> So down there on yours,\nthat TPM administration.\n\n1263\n01:05:27,463 --> 01:05:29,240\nLets click on that.\n\n1264\n01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:34,610\nAnd I believe it will run through,\na little thing.\n\n1265\n01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:38,140\nPrepare TPM, Password Clear, Reset.\n\n1266\n01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:41,470\n>> So I haven't used my TPM so\nit should be completely blank.\n\n1267\n01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:41,974\n>> Right.\n\n1268\n01:05:41,974 --> 01:05:46,793\nYeah, there was a setting in here\nwhere it would, in one of these menus,\n\n1269\n01:05:46,793 --> 01:05:50,753\nit would test your TPM and\nmake sure that it was a BitLocker.\n\n1270\n01:05:50,753 --> 01:05:55,010\nBut there's a part in the wizard\nwhere it does that same thing.\n\n1271\n01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,470\n>> That's how I've always done it.\n\n1272\n01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:58,540\nYeah, I haven't seen\nthe individual screen.\n\n1273\n01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:02,760\nBut yeah, when you have a TPM,\nit ships from the factory and it's empty,\n\n1274\n01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,370\nthere's no keys in there.\n\n1275\n01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:08,390\nAnd so, in order to use the TPM you've\ngotta put your key in the TPM, and\n\n1276\n01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,370\nthe wizard will do it for you.\n\n1277\n01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:14,320\nBut you'll see here on this screen that\nNate showed me, you can actually go in and\n\n1278\n01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,440\nyou can erase the TPM.\n\n1279\n01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,880\nYou can clear it if it's already got\nstuff in it, and then you can prepare it.\n\n1280\n01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,090\nThat gets it ready for use with BitLocker\nif you're gonna be using the TPM.\n\n1281\n01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,830\nSo, my laptop has a TPM.\n\n1282\n01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,520\nMy old laptop didn't.\n\n1283\n01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,930\nI could still do BitLocker,\njust the TPM wasn't there.\n\n1284\n01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:33,140\nIf you don't have a TPM,\n\n1285\n01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:37,200\nyou simply have to store your\nencryption keys somewhere else.\n\n1286\n01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,160\nAnd on my old laptop, I used a USB key.\n\n1287\n01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,160\nI had a USB key that\nstored my encryption key.\n\n1288\n01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,720\nAnd so when I turned on my laptop, I\nwould have to have that USB key in there.\n\n1289\n01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,110\nIf it wasn't in there I couldn't boot up,\nall right?\n\n1290\n01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:52,960\nAnd so I would plug the key in,\nboot up my laptop, take the key out.\n\n1291\n01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,190\nAnd so even when my laptop was running,\nI didn't leave the key connected.\n\n1292\n01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:59,200\nI always kept it on my key chain.\n\n1293\n01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,215\nAnd that way, if my laptop was\never stolen, I had the key.\n\n1294\n01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:04,645\nNobody could get into it, right?\n\n1295\n01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,175\nIt was kept apart.\n\n1296\n01:07:06,175 --> 01:07:07,501\n>> Hm.\nOh yeah, there it is,\n\n1297\n01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:09,445\nyeah, down there at the last one.\n\n1298\n01:07:09,445 --> 01:07:15,109\nTPM manufacturer information, ATML\nmanufacturer number, specific version 1.2.\n\n1299\n01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:15,793\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1300\n01:07:15,793 --> 01:07:16,715\nSo we're awesome.\n\n1301\n01:07:16,715 --> 01:07:17,272\n1.2.\n\n1302\n01:07:17,272 --> 01:07:17,835\n>> Yup.\n\n1303\n01:07:17,835 --> 01:07:18,409\nThere we go.\n\n1304\n01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,510\n>> Now, you might ask yourself,\nhang on Don.\n\n1305\n01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:25,090\nIf the security key is stored in the TPM,\nand it's right there on the motherboard,\n\n1306\n01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:28,550\nand somebody steals the whole computer,\ncan't they just get in?\n\n1307\n01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:29,300\nRight?\n\n1308\n01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,612\nWell, there's a little more to it.\n\n1309\n01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:35,500\nWith BitLocker it's dual factor\nauthentication, or two factor,\n\n1310\n01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,480\nor multi-factor, or\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n1311\n01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,540\nWhere there's two things involved,\nsomething you know, and\n\n1312\n01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,650\nsomething you have.\n\n1313\n01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,820\nThe something you have\npart is your security key.\n\n1314\n01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,690\nIt can be a USB key, or it can be a TPM.\n\n1315\n01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:46,650\nThat's something you have.\n\n1316\n01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,910\nBut then there's something you know.\n\n1317\n01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:52,970\nWhen you boot up off of\na system that's got a TPM, and\n\n1318\n01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:56,680\nit loads your operating system,\nyes, it boots the operating system.\n\n1319\n01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:00,240\nBut then you've gotta log in with a user\nname and password to gain access, right?\n\n1320\n01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,030\nSo, that's the something you know.\n\n1321\n01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:07,120\nIf you boot up from a live CD though,\nyou're skipping the TPM, and\n\n1322\n01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,830\nyou're skipping the login on the machine.\n\n1323\n01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:12,160\nYou don't have either of the two factors\nto be able to get into the system.\n\n1324\n01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,680\nAnd so you're unable to access it.\n\n1325\n01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,750\nAnd if you remove the hard drive, now\nyou've taken the TPM out of the equation.\n\n1326\n01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,800\nAnd so again, you've lost one of\nthe factors that are available.\n\n1327\n01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,460\nAll right.\n\n1328\n01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,310\nBut, if you're using a TPM and\nsomebody steals your laptop, and\n\n1329\n01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,550\nthey know your user name, and they know\nyour password, yes they can get in.\n\n1330\n01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,808\nBut you know what,\nyou've already got bigger problems.\n\n1331\n01:08:30,808 --> 01:08:32,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If they know your user name and\n\n1332\n01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:35,740\npassword, you got bigger problems that\nthe fact that they just stole your laptop.\n\n1333\n01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,130\nSo, you definitely need\nto keep that in mind,\n\n1334\n01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:40,910\nthat this is not the be-all,\nend-all solution to security.\n\n1335\n01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:47,427\n>> Yeah, let's finish running through\nthat Bitlocker To Go wizard on there.\n\n1336\n01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:48,148\n>> All right.\n\n1337\n01:08:48,148 --> 01:08:50,620\n>> Let's turn that guy on.\n\n1338\n01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,540\n>> So it's got my hard drive right\nthere and I'm just, or Nate's key.\n\n1339\n01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:54,370\nAnd I'm just going to\nchoose Turn On BitLocker.\n\n1340\n01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:57,810\nIt's gonna do a couple of checks to\nmake sure that BitLocker is valid.\n\n1341\n01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:01,800\nFor example,\nyour USB key has to be of a certain size.\n\n1342\n01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,066\nBitLocker requires, is it 200 megabytes?\n\n1343\n01:09:04,066 --> 01:09:07,012\nI think it's 200 megabytes for\nits little partition.\n\n1344\n01:09:07,012 --> 01:09:10,262\nSo if you have one of those ancient\n64 meg or 128 meg USB keys, or\n\n1345\n01:09:10,262 --> 01:09:12,670\nwhatever, it's not gonna\nwork with BitLocker.\n\n1346\n01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,860\nBut this one's 16 gigs, nice and big.\n\n1347\n01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:19,240\nNow when we go to set it up,\nit asks how we want to handle the unlock.\n\n1348\n01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:23,840\nTPM is not an option here,\nbecause this is a removable device.\n\n1349\n01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,510\nSo we can either do a password,\nor a smart card.\n\n1350\n01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:31,310\nIf you've got a smart card reader, it can\nwrite the certificate to the smart card.\n\n1351\n01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,720\nAnd as long as it's present you'll\nbe able to unlock with that.\n\n1352\n01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,420\nI'm gonna choose to use a password.\n\n1353\n01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:40,690\nAnd I'll just use the word password,\nall lowercase, cuz I'm all about security.\n\n1354\n01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,980\nIs it gonna complain about that?\n\n1355\n01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:44,810\nNope.\nAll right.\n\n1356\n01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,180\nNow here's the thing.\n\n1357\n01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:47,860\nOh, you wanna tackle this one?\n\n1358\n01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:51,354\n>> Oh, no I, all right so,\nhere's the thing.\n\n1359\n01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:56,313\nNow new to Windows 8,\nwe have the option to save that\n\n1360\n01:09:56,313 --> 01:10:00,910\nrecovery key to your Microsoft account.\n\n1361\n01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:05,590\nThat's what I do on mine, for\nmy thumb drives and everything.\n\n1362\n01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:11,450\nAnd on this PC I was trying to get\ndual boot to work a certain way,\n\n1363\n01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:13,810\nand it hosed it up.\n\n1364\n01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:17,430\nAnd because that one drive was\na BitLocker, I had to get my key and,\n\n1365\n01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:21,460\nyou log into your Microsoft account,\nand you can get that 48 digit key.\n\n1366\n01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:26,160\nBut, yeah, we can save it to a file,\nthat 48 digit number,\n\n1367\n01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:31,080\nyou can dump it on a flash drive,\nor stick it somewhere, or print-\n\n1368\n01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,543\n>> You can stick it somewhere.\n\n1369\n01:10:33,543 --> 01:10:35,085\n[LAUGH]\n>> You can print the key out and\n\n1370\n01:10:35,085 --> 01:10:37,950\nstick it in your wallet, or\nhide it under your keyboard or whatnot.\n\n1371\n01:10:37,950 --> 01:10:42,170\nBut yeah, saving to the Microsoft account,\nit's quick, it's easy, it's convenient.\n\n1372\n01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,330\n>> Really convenient.\n\n1373\n01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:45,730\nAnd that recovery key, what it is,\n\n1374\n01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:48,790\nif you ever forget your password,\nif you've got it where for some reason,\n\n1375\n01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:51,680\nyou can't unlock that key, like Nate\nmentioned with his dual boot setup.\n\n1376\n01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,210\nIf you can't get in, here's your backup.\n\n1377\n01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:57,760\nThis is a key that'll let you get in and\naccess that data.\n\n1378\n01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:02,445\nI really highly recommend it when you're\ndealing with USB and removable devices.\n\n1379\n01:11:02,445 --> 01:11:05,780\nCuz it is easy to forget that password and\nget locked out of your own stuff, so.\n\n1380\n01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:10,340\n>> Yeah, and real quick,\non this one I do have a TPM.\n\n1381\n01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,860\nAnd the hard drive was still in there.\n\n1382\n01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:15,130\nBut messing with the boot stuff,\n\n1383\n01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:19,145\nit was enough to show some\nkind of change and broke it.\n\n1384\n01:11:19,145 --> 01:11:21,890\nAnd even with having that\nTPM it didn't like it.\n\n1385\n01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,460\nI still had to go and grab that key.\n\n1386\n01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,895\n>> Yeah, it probably thought you were\na hacker setting up up a second operating\n\n1387\n01:11:26,895 --> 01:11:29,000\nsystem, whatever, and said nope.\n\n1388\n01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,032\nI'm not gonna let that happen.\n\n1389\n01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:33,150\nAll right, I'll save mine to a file so\nthat we can look at it.\n\n1390\n01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,480\nIt's just a text file\nat the end of the day.\n\n1391\n01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,590\nLet me stick it on my desktop.\n\n1392\n01:11:39,992 --> 01:11:43,380\nAll right, so I just saved it to\nthe desktop and I'm gonna pull that up.\n\n1393\n01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:48,520\nIt's always easy to spot cuz it's\ngot an extremely long file name.\n\n1394\n01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,042\nIt's always easy to spot,\noh there it is, all right good.\n\n1395\n01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:53,958\nIt's so easy to spot that I can't find it.\n\n1396\n01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:54,794\nOh there it is.\n\n1397\n01:11:54,794 --> 01:11:59,039\nSo here's the file that it made and\nyou can see BitLocker drive encryption\n\n1398\n01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:02,750\nrecovery key, and then it's got\nthe identifier for my laptop.\n\n1399\n01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:06,403\nAnd then here's the recovery key,\nit's a 48-digit key,\n\n1400\n01:12:06,403 --> 01:12:09,780\nit's nice and short and easy to remember.\n\n1401\n01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,710\nYou'll never remember this.\n\n1402\n01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,210\nSo, it's stored right here in the file.\n\n1403\n01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:15,604\nKeep in mind,\nif somebody gets a hold of this file,\n\n1404\n01:12:15,604 --> 01:12:17,448\nthey can now decrypt your your laptop.\n\n1405\n01:12:17,448 --> 01:12:18,460\nRight?\n\n1406\n01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,040\nNot just access your data,\nthey can decrypt it if they want.\n\n1407\n01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,210\nThey don't have to though.\n\n1408\n01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:24,250\nThey can use this just to gain access and\n\n1409\n01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:27,490\nthey'll be able to get in and\nsee all your stuff.\n\n1410\n01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,260\nAll your secrets.\n\n1411\n01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,020\nAll that naughty stuff.\n\n1412\n01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:34,060\nSo anyhow, all your government secrets.\n\n1413\n01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,872\nThe secret agent stuff.\n\n1414\n01:12:35,872 --> 01:12:37,660\nAll right, so I'm going to go ahead and\nhit next here.\n\n1415\n01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,340\nAnd now it's going to offer to encrypt it.\n\n1416\n01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,870\nNow there's two ways\nthat it can encrypt it.\n\n1417\n01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:47,260\nIt can encrypt just the areas of the\nstorage that have data in them right now,\n\n1418\n01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:51,490\nand then the empty spots,\nit'll encrypt as we copy data to it.\n\n1419\n01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:56,550\nOr you can tell it to encrypt the whole\nthing, if there's already data there and\n\n1420\n01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:57,870\nwe want to be on the safe side.\n\n1421\n01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:01,720\nAll right, now I always recommend\nthat you encrypt the whole thing.\n\n1422\n01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:07,440\nIt takes longer, but it ensures that the\nwhole drive is encrypted from the get-go.\n\n1423\n01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,680\nIf you don't,\n\n1424\n01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,590\nthen the empty space is still susceptible\nto drive recovery tactics, right?\n\n1425\n01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:16,880\nSomebody can run an undelete program and\nsalvage data off of those empty spaces.\n\n1426\n01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,670\nSo it's usually better\nto do the whole thing.\n\n1427\n01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,380\nThis is just a 16 gig drive so\nit won't take that long.\n\n1428\n01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:25,780\nBut if this were a one terabyte drive,\nI've had those take 12 hours, 14 hours.\n\n1429\n01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,660\nYou know they can take a long\ntime depending on the drive.\n\n1430\n01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:32,480\nSo I'm gonna choose to go ahead and\nencrypt the drive, the whole thing,\n\n1431\n01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,640\nand then I'll hit next.\n\n1432\n01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,850\nAnd we'll start it up.\n\n1433\n01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:41,170\nNow, if this was my C drive that I was\nencrypting, there would be one more step.\n\n1434\n01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:44,690\nIt does a test and\nverification phase before it encrypts.\n\n1435\n01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:49,140\nIt encrypts a very small part of the hard\ndrive and then it offers to reboot.\n\n1436\n01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:49,650\nAll right?\n\n1437\n01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:52,580\nYou'd be a fool not to do that,\nyou really should.\n\n1438\n01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,990\nIt'll reboot, and then after the reboot\nit will see if you can access that data.\n\n1439\n01:13:56,990 --> 01:14:01,980\nIf it can, it will then move on to\nencrypt the whole operating system drive.\n\n1440\n01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:05,770\nIf it can't, it will warn you,\nand it won't encrypt the drive.\n\n1441\n01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:08,450\nBasically Microsoft doesn't want\nto encrypt your OS drive and\n\n1442\n01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,380\nthen have you not be able to boot to it\nand lock yourself out of the machine.\n\n1443\n01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,460\nSo it's a little safety measure and it\ndoes that when you encrypt your OS drive,\n\n1444\n01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,260\nso just be aware of that, don't skip it.\n\n1445\n01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,410\nYou might be tempted, don't do it,\n\n1446\n01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,488\nmake sure you do that reboot and\nmake sure it works.\n\n1447\n01:14:22,488 --> 01:14:26,040\n>> Yeah,\nyou know some users might be a little wary\n\n1448\n01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,670\nto encrypt their entire hard drive,\nbut what if?\n\n1449\n01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:32,160\nWhat if something does happen and\neverything is gone?\n\n1450\n01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:37,440\nAnd that little test,\nit can offer a bit of reassurance,\n\n1451\n01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:43,310\nthat yes it does encrypt, yes it does\nunlock and everything works good.\n\n1452\n01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:48,290\nWe're fine, we can proceed forward and\ndo the rest of it.\n\n1453\n01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:53,440\n>> So right now, mine just says that\nDrive D it's BitLocker encrypting.\n\n1454\n01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,460\nSo it's sitting there encrypting itself.\n\n1455\n01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,825\nThe drive is called recovery,\n\n1456\n01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,690\ncause in yesterday's show we made\nit into a Windows 8 recovery disk.\n\n1457\n01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:01,722\nThat's why it says recovery.\n\n1458\n01:15:01,722 --> 01:15:04,550\nBut BitLocker encrypting, and\n\n1459\n01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:09,370\nthat status will change over time to\neventually show that it is encrypted.\n\n1460\n01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:12,890\nRight now it's unlocked and\nso it's not secured.\n\n1461\n01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:15,050\nIt's not secured until that turns yellow.\n\n1462\n01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:18,690\nThen we'll know that it's ready to go and\nthe status will change.\n\n1463\n01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:22,580\n>> You've got a little pop-up down\nthere at the bottom that's minimized.\n\n1464\n01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:23,410\n>> Oh, I do.\nLook at that.\n\n1465\n01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:25,070\n>> There it goes.\n\n1466\n01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:27,980\n>> Wow, it's a blazing fast USB 2.0.\n\n1467\n01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:33,060\n>> Yeah,\nthat little drive is insanely slow.\n\n1468\n01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,441\n>> So are we doing a marathon episode?\n\n1469\n01:15:34,441 --> 01:15:36,005\nIs this gonna be an eight hour episode?\n\n1470\n01:15:36,005 --> 01:15:37,805\n>> [LAUGH] Sure you can just yank it.\n\n1471\n01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:40,914\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so that's it so\n\n1472\n01:15:40,914 --> 01:15:45,010\ndont mention in detail about the TPM.\n\n1473\n01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:48,850\nYou don't have to have a TPM, but\n\n1474\n01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:52,940\nyou can't just fire it up, go into\nBitLocker, and use it without a TPM.\n\n1475\n01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:57,420\nYou have to go into policies,\nand change a policy.\n\n1476\n01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:02,790\nAnd there's a few policies in there\nthat are worth going through.\n\n1477\n01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:05,810\nAnd, oh wait.\n\n1478\n01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,580\n>> Do you have them memorized?\n\n1479\n01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:11,330\nI can pull up the group policy\nover here on my machine.\n\n1480\n01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:13,410\nSo, if you have a TPM, yeah,\n\n1481\n01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:17,410\nyou can enable BitLocker right off on\nyour OS drive and it will work just fine.\n\n1482\n01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,100\nIf you don't have a TPM though,\n\n1483\n01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,760\nyou actually have to go into\nyour group policy editor.\n\n1484\n01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,730\nSo I just fired up my\nlocal group policy editor.\n\n1485\n01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:29,110\nAnd if you didn't see how I did that,\nI just went into my modern UI and\n\n1486\n01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:33,830\nI typed in group policy, and\nit's under settings on the right side, and\n\n1487\n01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,050\nyou'll see edit group policy.\n\n1488\n01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:37,400\nThat's your local policy editor.\n\n1489\n01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,275\nAnd inside of here, I'm pretty sure\nit's under Computer, and Windows.\n\n1490\n01:16:41,275 --> 01:16:41,937\n>> Administrative.\n\n1491\n01:16:41,937 --> 01:16:46,527\n>> Oh it is Administrative and then\nWindows Components or something like that?\n\n1492\n01:16:46,527 --> 01:16:49,832\n>> Windows components,\nthen BitLocker, drive encryption.\n\n1493\n01:16:49,832 --> 01:16:50,575\n>> There we go.\n\n1494\n01:16:50,575 --> 01:16:55,230\nAnd so in here we'll see several options\nthat customize how BitLocker works.\n\n1495\n01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:57,517\nAnd you'll see in here, let's see.\n\n1496\n01:16:57,517 --> 01:17:01,390\n>> You know Don,\nif you want to we can switch over to mine.\n\n1497\n01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:06,193\nMine's showing up a little bit bigger.\n\n1498\n01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:09,300\n>> Oh yeah, much more legible, all right.\n\n1499\n01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:13,870\n>> On those notes over there,\nwe've got a couple to point out so\n\n1500\n01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,740\nwe don't miss anything.\n\n1501\n01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:25,590\nTo turn it on without a TPM,\nin the operating system drive's folder,\n\n1502\n01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:30,320\nthere's one, require additional\nauthentication at start up.\n\n1503\n01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:37,040\nThis one here will need to be enabled\nto allow a Bitwalker without that TPM.\n\n1504\n01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,430\n>> Yeah,\ncuz that is the requirement by default.\n\n1505\n01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,200\n>> Yep.\n\n1506\n01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,520\nWe enable this policy and we can set.\n\n1507\n01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,630\nYep.\nAllow it without a compatible TPM.\n\n1508\n01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:50,050\nAnd then it has to be with something else,\nright?\n\n1509\n01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:53,300\nSome other kind of unlock something.\n\n1510\n01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:59,580\nYou know, with a PIN, start up key,\nand all that good fun stuff.\n\n1511\n01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:01,940\nThere are some others.\n\n1512\n01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:07,040\nSee up here, allow network,\nunlock at startup.\n\n1513\n01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:11,830\nThis right here is a cool one if you're\na part of an active directory domain.\n\n1514\n01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,580\nWhenever your computer is\nconnected to that network,\n\n1515\n01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,950\nit will unlock automatically.\n\n1516\n01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:24,500\nCertificates are saved,\nit requires these like, protector things.\n\n1517\n01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,619\n>> Protector things.\n\n1518\n01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:28,380\n>> [LAUGH] Other stuff,\nI forgot what it's really called.\n\n1519\n01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,610\n>> It's mostly configured from the server\nside is what Nate's trying to say, not so\n\n1520\n01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:33,440\nmuch from the desktop side.\n\n1521\n01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,790\n>> Yeah, you know, and network unlocks.\n\n1522\n01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:39,620\nSo if you have a bunch of PC's at work and\nif you're rolling out updates or something\n\n1523\n01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:44,760\nthat requires the computers to restart,\nthey can restart and come back online.\n\n1524\n01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,140\nOr if you have servers.\n\n1525\n01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:51,783\nAnd typically you can get to the servers,\nor locked away somewhere, so the service\n\n1526\n01:18:51,783 --> 01:18:56,950\ncan reboot if they're still in the network\nand they can unlock themselves.\n\n1527\n01:18:58,191 --> 01:18:59,580\nAnd let's see, there are.\n\n1528\n01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:04,350\n>> So you've got that disallow standard\nusers from changing the PIN or password.\n\n1529\n01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:05,520\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1530\n01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,780\nIf your users are taking\nBitLocker stuff home and\n\n1531\n01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,410\nyou don't want them to change it or\ndo something foul.\n\n1532\n01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:14,042\n>> Decrypt it.\n\n1533\n01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:16,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, decrypt it.\n\n1534\n01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:18,280\nOr encrypt stuff.\n\n1535\n01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:22,470\nChange the key and walk away.\n\n1536\n01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:26,017\nCould be, but\nyou do have that option there.\n\n1537\n01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:31,360\n>> Enforce drive encryption type\non operating system drives.\n\n1538\n01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:31,970\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1539\n01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:34,300\nThis one right here is pretty neat.\n\n1540\n01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,950\nIt is new to Windows 8.\n\n1541\n01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,430\nBitLocker was also on Windows 7.\n\n1542\n01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:42,470\nSome of these settings new to Windows 8.\n\n1543\n01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:47,080\nSo you can force, whether or\nnot you want to do the whole drive or\n\n1544\n01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,500\njust part of the drive.\n\n1545\n01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,510\nYou know, in your little wizard there.\n\n1546\n01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:53,180\n>> Yeah remember how I said,\nI always recommend you do the full drive.\n\n1547\n01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:57,133\nWell here you can force that so\nthe user doesn't even get the choice,\n\n1548\n01:19:57,133 --> 01:20:00,417\nthey have to do the full drive and\nnot just the used space.\n\n1549\n01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:01,500\n>> And let's see.\n\n1550\n01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,792\n>> That's the last one in our list.\n\n1551\n01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:03,625\nExcept for the mobile ones.\n\n1552\n01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:06,167\nIf you go to the removable Folder.\n\n1553\n01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:08,083\nThat's where he had a few others marked.\n\n1554\n01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:09,625\n>> Yep.\nAll right.\n\n1555\n01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:12,970\nThere's control use of\nBitLocker on removal drives.\n\n1556\n01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:18,557\nYou can set this to where users\nthey can use it on their drives.\n\n1557\n01:20:21,437 --> 01:20:26,220\n>> You've got deny right access to removal\ndrives not protected by BitLocker.\n\n1558\n01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:31,830\n>> Yeah, had the option, employees bring\nin their USB keys and yeah, I lock it down\n\n1559\n01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:37,650\nso they have to have that drive encrypted\nbefore they're able to use it at work.\n\n1560\n01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:42,755\n>> Yeah, every now and then you'll get\na USB key where something will happen and\n\n1561\n01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:46,775\nthe little boot record on it or whatever\nwill get messed up, the partition table.\n\n1562\n01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:49,325\nAnd you'll plug in that USB key, and\nWindows will say, not recognized.\n\n1563\n01:20:49,325 --> 01:20:50,715\nWould you like to format it?\n\n1564\n01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:53,665\nAnd if you format it,\nnow it's a blank USB key.\n\n1565\n01:20:53,665 --> 01:20:56,550\nThe user can start using it again,\nbut it's not encrypted.\n\n1566\n01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,040\nSo with this policy setting, you can,\n\n1567\n01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:02,120\nsay, deny people the ability to\nwrite to unencrypted USB keys.\n\n1568\n01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,150\nSo if they ever accidentally\ndisable the encryption,\n\n1569\n01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,050\nnow you don't have to worry about it.\n\n1570\n01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:11,009\nThey won't be able to write until\nthey re-encrypt that drive.\n\n1571\n01:21:11,009 --> 01:21:15,800\nAnd then you also have the enforced\ndrive encryption type on removable\n\n1572\n01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,898\ndata which is the same\nas on the other drives.\n\n1573\n01:21:18,898 --> 01:21:22,940\n>> And there is the last one.\n\n1574\n01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:26,970\nNow choose a drive encryption method and\ncipher strength.\n\n1575\n01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:31,330\nDepending on policies or\nwhatnot, BitLocker, by default,\n\n1576\n01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:36,220\nuses AES 128 bit, and\nof course you just have one other option,\n\n1577\n01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:41,120\nAES 256 bit, depending on whatever\npolicies you have set up, or\n\n1578\n01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,710\nif you want to be super-secure or\nwhatever.\n\n1579\n01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:45,820\n>> Whatever strength\nyour company requires.\n\n1580\n01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:47,760\nJust keep in mind,\nthe stronger the encryption,\n\n1581\n01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,432\nthe more of a performance load it creates.\n\n1582\n01:21:49,432 --> 01:21:50,192\n>> Yep.\nAnd\n\n1583\n01:21:50,192 --> 01:21:55,020\nAES 128 is the default that\nBitLocker uses to encrypt.\n\n1584\n01:21:56,020 --> 01:22:03,290\nAnd yeah I think those are the good fun\nones on our own stuff out that would\n\n1585\n01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:09,000\nbe worth mentioning for policy settings\nfor BitLocker and BitLocker to go.\n\n1586\n01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,820\n>> Yeah.\nSo BitLocker, really cool stuff.\n\n1587\n01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:12,097\nThose settings that you just saw,\n\n1588\n01:22:12,097 --> 01:22:14,487\nthat's not something you'll\nnormally apply to one computer.\n\n1589\n01:22:14,487 --> 01:22:17,614\nIt's something you'd apply\nto thousands of computers so\n\n1590\n01:22:17,614 --> 01:22:20,560\nyou got a consistent\nconfiguration across the board.\n\n1591\n01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,530\nAll right, well we've got a lot\nmore stuff to go through.\n\n1592\n01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:25,532\nWe've got remote wipe which\nI think is really cool.\n\n1593\n01:22:25,532 --> 01:22:29,660\nAnd we got GPS settings and\nstuff like that coming down the line.\n\n1594\n01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:31,050\nBut we're right upon our break time, so\n\n1595\n01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,360\ndo you got anything else to throw\nin before we stop for break?\n\n1596\n01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:33,950\n>> I'm good.\n\n1597\n01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:34,700\n>> Okay.\n\n1598\n01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,740\nLet's stop here.\n\n1599\n01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:40,320\nI think we're gonna take\na lunch break here at ITProTV.\n\n1600\n01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,231\nWhen we get back, we're gonna dive\nback into some of our remaining mobile\n\n1601\n01:22:44,231 --> 01:22:46,518\ntechnology before we wrap up the episode.\n\n1602\n01:22:46,518 --> 01:22:47,689\nSo, stay tuned for\n\n1603\n01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:51,800\nmore action packed adventures after\nI get some food in my stomach.\n\n1604\n01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,899\nSo, ladies and gentlemen,\nsee you back in a few minutes.\n\n1605\n01:22:54,899 --> 01:23:02,597\n[MUSIC]\n\n1606\n01:23:02,597 --> 01:23:04,400\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1607\n01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:09,880\nSo, we left off talking about BitLocker\nand we talked about one point, but\n\n1608\n01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,270\nNate mentioned to me during lunch, that we\nshould probably call it out a little more,\n\n1609\n01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:18,880\nso lets jump back in time to\nthe world of Bitlocker and\n\n1610\n01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,280\nwe just want to take a brief moment to\ntalk about start up key storage, right?\n\n1611\n01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,490\nAnd by start up key we\nmean that encryption key.\n\n1612\n01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:29,460\nAnd we talked about bit-locker and\nsome of the other things but\n\n1613\n01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,698\nwe want to make sure we\ncover it in-depth right?\n\n1614\n01:23:32,698 --> 01:23:33,930\n>> Mm, Yeah.\n\n1615\n01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:37,940\nSo yeah, for that start up key storage,\na number of ways.\n\n1616\n01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:43,680\nBack up to the Microsoft account,\nmy preferred method.\n\n1617\n01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,980\nWe can save it as a text file.\n\n1618\n01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:51,480\nWe can save it on a USB key,\nwhich I guess would be a text file.\n\n1619\n01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:55,030\nAnd back it up in the active directory,\n\n1620\n01:23:55,030 --> 01:24:00,320\nif your machine is part of a domain and\nI guess the TPM, sync it there.\n\n1621\n01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:05,490\n>> Now as far as the recovery piece,\nall of those are as an option, right?\n\n1622\n01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:10,580\nBut at boot time when you want to boot up,\nthat text file doesn't help you.\n\n1623\n01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:14,770\nYou have to be able to read the text file,\nsee the code, and type it in, okay?\n\n1624\n01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:17,420\nSo just having the text file is\nonly just part of that equation,\n\n1625\n01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,850\nyou actually need to type it in yourself.\n\n1626\n01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:23,940\nVersus, if you've had it saved to\nlike a USB key or in your TPM, or\n\n1627\n01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:25,730\nin the active directory,\nthose load automatically.\n\n1628\n01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:27,035\nYou don't have to type it in.\n\n1629\n01:24:27,035 --> 01:24:30,970\nSo just be aware that even\nthough it is nice and stored and\n\n1630\n01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:34,330\nit's in a file that the bit-locker soccer\nitself doesn't even read that file.\n\n1631\n01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:37,320\nYou've actually got to sit there and\nhunt and peck.\n\n1632\n01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,375\nIt's a good time.\n\n1633\n01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:44,690\n>> Yeah, so like,\nyou do have that TPM in there or whatnot.\n\n1634\n01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:49,620\nYou can set it up to where you have\nto enter in a password along with\n\n1635\n01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:53,710\nhaving that thing in the TPM or a PIN so\n\n1636\n01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:56,986\nyou can have more than one way way\nof having to unlock the thing.\n\n1637\n01:24:56,986 --> 01:24:58,380\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1638\n01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:59,380\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1639\n01:24:59,380 --> 01:24:59,930\n>> All right, so\n\n1640\n01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:04,610\nlet's move on to some other cool\nthings inside of our mobile devices.\n\n1641\n01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:06,390\nThe next one I want to\ntalk about is a neat one.\n\n1642\n01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,830\nIt's one that we've had in the.\n\n1643\n01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:09,830\nOh, you're making the face,\ndid I skip something?\n\n1644\n01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:10,410\n>> No, nope.\n\n1645\n01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:13,192\n>> He's making the God you've\nskipped something face.\n\n1646\n01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:17,460\nWhat I wanna talk about now is something\nwe've had in the phone world for a while\n\n1647\n01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:20,910\nand Microsoft is now introducing into\nthe desktop world, which is remote wipe.\n\n1648\n01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:23,190\nOkay?\nOne of the problems that we have on\n\n1649\n01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:25,240\ncellphones is that they're\nreally easy to lose.\n\n1650\n01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,140\nYou can a cellphone at the drop of a hat.\n\n1651\n01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:32,460\nAnd if you have your email account on that\nphone, now access to your entire email\n\n1652\n01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,000\naccount is available to whatever stranger\npicks up your phone and gains access.\n\n1653\n01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,560\nWell, if you think about it, your desktop\nisn't much different, or your laptop even.\n\n1654\n01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,230\nSo, if you leave your laptop or\nyour Windows 8 tablet,\n\n1655\n01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:46,640\nmaybe you've got a Surface Pro or\na Surface Surface.\n\n1656\n01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,100\nIt's just called a Surface now right?\n\n1657\n01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,360\nThe Surface RT.\n\n1658\n01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,830\nSo, if you've got one of those that\nyou just, you leave it in a cab or\n\n1659\n01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:56,130\nwhatever, somebody could grab that and\njump right into your email, and\n\n1660\n01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,040\nnow they've got access.\n\n1661\n01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,265\nThat's a big deal, all right?\n\n1662\n01:25:58,265 --> 01:25:58,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1663\n01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:00,700\n>> So, in Microsoft Exchange,\n\n1664\n01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,260\nthey actually introduced it in\nMicrosoft Exchange 2010, and\n\n1665\n01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:08,620\nit's a part of 2013 also,\nif you company has an Exchange server, and\n\n1666\n01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:14,430\nyour Windows 8 machine has the Windows\nMail Client tied to that exchange server,\n\n1667\n01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:18,010\nthen from exchange you can\nremotely wipe the device.\n\n1668\n01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:22,130\nNow, when we talk about remotely wiping a\nphone, it actually erases the whole phone,\n\n1669\n01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:24,080\nputs it back to factory defaults.\n\n1670\n01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,026\nOn your laptop or tablet though,\n\n1671\n01:26:26,026 --> 01:26:29,302\nit's just going to wipe out\nthe email portion, right.\n\n1672\n01:26:29,302 --> 01:26:31,415\nSo what all's it do, Nate?\n\n1673\n01:26:31,415 --> 01:26:32,610\nContacts, calendar.\n\n1674\n01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:36,470\n>> Yep, got the calendar, the contacts,\n\n1675\n01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:42,010\nthe email that's tied with the built in\n\n1676\n01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:48,995\nemail client, the modern new iClient.\n\n1677\n01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:53,470\n>> And neat kind of point there,\nit is the modern new iClient, not Outlook.\n\n1678\n01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:55,700\nIf you're running Microsoft Outlook,\nthe remote wipe isn't there yet.\n\n1679\n01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,040\nSo they're still working on that.\n\n1680\n01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,410\nAnd the another thing is that it\ndoesn't wipe the whole device, right?\n\n1681\n01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:02,656\nSo you really should have BitLocker.\n\n1682\n01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,050\nIf you got BitLocker on there,\n\n1683\n01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:06,960\nand you lose your device,\nit's not a big deal, right?\n\n1684\n01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,170\nPhones don't support Bitlocker though and\nthat's why it's so\n\n1685\n01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:13,120\nimportant to wipe the whole thing\non your tablet or a laptop.\n\n1686\n01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,310\nThere it really should just\nbe BitLocker protection.\n\n1687\n01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:17,430\nBut it is a neat thing to have.\n\n1688\n01:27:18,945 --> 01:27:22,065\nWe don't use Exchange here at IT Pro TV,\nbut\n\n1689\n01:27:22,065 --> 01:27:27,745\none of our companies that we do a lot of\nwork with here in town, New Horizons,\n\n1690\n01:27:27,745 --> 01:27:31,170\nthey have an Exchange server they're\nletting me borrow here for the show.\n\n1691\n01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:34,470\nSo I went ahead and connected my\nlaptop up to their exchange service so\n\n1692\n01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:35,570\nI could show you.\n\n1693\n01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:40,430\nIf I go into my modern UI here,\nhere's the modern email client,\n\n1694\n01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:44,750\nand so I can fire that up and I can\nstart shooting emails out to everybody.\n\n1695\n01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:45,950\nOoh, exciting.\n\n1696\n01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:48,860\nIt's empty here because\nit's a new mailbox.\n\n1697\n01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:53,792\nBut basically, normally I would have a ton\nof message in here and all of my stuff.\n\n1698\n01:27:53,792 --> 01:27:58,635\nWell when you set up the modern UI email\nclient to connect to an exchange server\n\n1699\n01:27:58,635 --> 01:28:02,958\nit creates a setting on the exchange\nserver that allows it to remotely\n\n1700\n01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:04,543\nwipe the email portion.\n\n1701\n01:28:04,543 --> 01:28:07,792\nAnd so you can see down here I've got\nlike my Hotmail account is added.\n\n1702\n01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:11,343\nAnd this Nhnorthflorida,\nthat's the New Horizons guys, so\n\n1703\n01:28:11,343 --> 01:28:13,334\nI've got them here on my list too.\n\n1704\n01:28:13,334 --> 01:28:17,901\nIf I were to lose my laptop,\nif I were to lose my device, you know,\n\n1705\n01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:22,570\nleave it on a cab or whatever,\nI could log into Outlook Web Access.\n\n1706\n01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:28,320\nAnd when I log into Outlook Web Access,\n\n1707\n01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,640\nI'll have the option in there to be\nable to remotely wipe this device.\n\n1708\n01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,510\nSo I can go up here to Options,\nand See All Options.\n\n1709\n01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:42,160\nAnd I can go into Settings, or\nnot Settings, I can go into Phone.\n\n1710\n01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,800\nIt's kinda weird that it's under Phone,\nbut that's where it is.\n\n1711\n01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,960\nAnd I can see right here, Windows Mail,\nphone number not available.\n\n1712\n01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,440\nThat is my laptop, right?\n\n1713\n01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:57,300\nAnd it's not the whole laptop, it's just\nthe Windows Mail portion of it, and so\n\n1714\n01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,840\nif I wanna remote wipe it,\nI can choose it.\n\n1715\n01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,460\nAnd Nate.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1716\n01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,150\n>> Nate and I had a funny conversation.\n\n1717\n01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:04,840\nHe didn't think I was brave enough-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1718\n01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,640\n>> To hit the wipe device button live\n\n1719\n01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:07,340\nduring the show.\n\n1720\n01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:08,370\nI'm gonna do it.\n\n1721\n01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:12,410\nWes and I have another show, another\nWindows 8 show coming up right after this\n\n1722\n01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:17,210\none, so if it wipes my whole device\n[LAUGH], we made that Windows to go\n\n1723\n01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:19,740\nboot drive earlier,\nI'll use that for the second show.\n\n1724\n01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:20,600\nWe'll see.\n\n1725\n01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,880\nSo I'm gonna wipe it.\n\n1726\n01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:22,890\nLet's see what happens.\n\n1727\n01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,449\nSo I'm gonna remote wipe it.\n\n1728\n01:29:24,449 --> 01:29:28,630\nAnd the idea is normally that my laptop\nis lost, I don't know where it is, so\n\n1729\n01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:34,280\nI'm hoping whoever stole it\nis going to hook it up to\n\n1730\n01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:39,500\na wireless network or something somewhere\nso that my little wipe signal will hit it.\n\n1731\n01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,030\nAnd what really happens is,\n\n1732\n01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:45,170\nthe next time the modern UI\nemail client checks the email,\n\n1733\n01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:49,440\nit'll see this white pending statement and\nthen it's gonna wipe the system.\n\n1734\n01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,960\nNot the whole system, but just\nthe email client, or it's supposed to.\n\n1735\n01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,770\nSo let's see if I can usher that along.\n\n1736\n01:29:56,770 --> 01:30:00,715\nIf I go in here and, oh,\nit's actually already done.\n\n1737\n01:30:00,715 --> 01:30:03,295\nSo when I went in here,\nit's actually done already.\n\n1738\n01:30:03,295 --> 01:30:05,555\nWhen I go in here,\nI see my Hotmail account.\n\n1739\n01:30:05,555 --> 01:30:09,385\nMy Nhnorthflorida, that exchange\naccount that was there, it's gone.\n\n1740\n01:30:09,385 --> 01:30:11,435\nIt's removed it from the system.\n\n1741\n01:30:11,435 --> 01:30:15,235\nIt's wiped the emails,\nwiped the contacts, wiped the calendar.\n\n1742\n01:30:15,235 --> 01:30:17,175\nThat entire account is gone.\n\n1743\n01:30:17,175 --> 01:30:19,745\nNow my corporate email is safe.\n\n1744\n01:30:19,745 --> 01:30:21,435\nAnd the rest of the thing is intact.\n\n1745\n01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:26,270\nYou might ask yourself why would I want\nto use something like this as opposed to\n\n1746\n01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:27,400\nBitLocker or whatever?\n\n1747\n01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,050\nThis is really for\nthe whole BYOD movement.\n\n1748\n01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,400\nBring your own device.\n\n1749\n01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:35,490\nSomebody might have their own laptop at\nhome that you don't control as far as\n\n1750\n01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:38,700\nwhat apps they have installed and\nstuff like that.\n\n1751\n01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,370\nBut if they've got their\ncorporate email on there,\n\n1752\n01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:42,810\nyou might want to yank that back.\n\n1753\n01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:45,600\nSo they don't have access to their\nemail after they've been terminated,\n\n1754\n01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,080\nor whatever.\n\n1755\n01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:51,040\nSo, neat, it actually worked\nsmoother than I thought it would.\n\n1756\n01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,770\n>> Well, yeah, of course.\n\n1757\n01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:56,185\nI don't know, I was going to\nmake some joke or something.\n\n1758\n01:30:56,185 --> 01:31:00,280\n>> Of course it's Microsoft, it's going\nto work the first time, no flaws there.\n\n1759\n01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:04,350\nYeah, yeah, well,\nthat's awesome that, yeah.\n\n1760\n01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:08,740\n>> So that's another one really useful for\nmobile devices because of the fact that'\n\n1761\n01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,340\nit's something that you can lose right,\nIt is something that somebody\n\n1762\n01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:15,040\ncould physically take and run with,\nand it wouldn't be that big of a deal.\n\n1763\n01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,030\nA desktop would be harder.\n\n1764\n01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:20,110\nFor someone to grab your desktop and\nsteal it.\n\n1765\n01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:21,800\n>> Yup, all right moving right along.\n\n1766\n01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:29,230\nThe last little sub objective that we\nhave, is configure location settings.\n\n1767\n01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:32,880\nAnd there's,\nI guess it'd be kind of a quick one.\n\n1768\n01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:38,800\nThere's not really a whole lot of location\nsettings that we can configure on here.\n\n1769\n01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,440\nBut yeah, we'd just touch on those guys.\n\n1770\n01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:43,180\n>> This is another thing that\ncame over from the mobile world.\n\n1771\n01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:46,490\nA lot of smart phones today have GPSs\nbuilt into them and it's awesome.\n\n1772\n01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:51,450\nBecause when you fire up something\nlike Google maps, or Bing maps,\n\n1773\n01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:53,380\nor what does Microsoft\ncall theirs these days?\n\n1774\n01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:56,050\nIt used to be Expedia or whatever.\n\n1775\n01:31:56,050 --> 01:32:00,230\nWhen you pull up maps from somebody,\nnow on a mobile phone\n\n1776\n01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,770\nit knows exactly where you\nare based on the GPS in your phone.\n\n1777\n01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:05,770\nYou don't have to buy a separate\nGPS unit like we all used to.\n\n1778\n01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,300\nNow it's just right there in the phone.\n\n1779\n01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:11,390\nWell, a lot of laptops are coming\nwith GPS built into them also.\n\n1780\n01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:15,680\nAnd so, in Windows 8, you can control\nwhether you want to use that.\n\n1781\n01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:19,870\nLet's take a look at my laptop here, and\nI'm just gonna pull up my Charms bar.\n\n1782\n01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:22,320\nActually, let me do it\na slightly different way.\n\n1783\n01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,760\nI'm gonna go into my Modern UI and\nthis is easier.\n\n1784\n01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,080\nI usually just go in here and\ntype GPS, and\n\n1785\n01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:32,850\nwhen you type GPS under Settings, you'll\nfind here Allow apps to use my location,\n\n1786\n01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:35,830\nTurn wireless on and off, and\nChange location settings.\n\n1787\n01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:39,960\nSo these are some of the spots that we\ngo into to customize how our GPS works.\n\n1788\n01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,380\nThis first one,\nAllow apps to use my location,\n\n1789\n01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:48,520\nWindows Store apps can use your\nGPS to figure out where you are.\n\n1790\n01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:51,960\nAnd it is really designed for things\nlike maps programs and stuff like that.\n\n1791\n01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,240\n>> The weather app too.\n\n1792\n01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,080\n>> The weather app is really cool,\nand I use Yelp.\n\n1793\n01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,160\nDo you ever use Yelp?\n\n1794\n01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:00,340\nSo, if you're going to a new town and\nyou're trying to find a restaurant.\n\n1795\n01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,980\nAnd you want to find one that\ndoesn't suck, you fire up Yelp and\n\n1796\n01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,175\nit gives you reviews.\n\n1797\n01:33:04,175 --> 01:33:07,905\nAnd it can look at your GPS so\nit'll know what town you're in.\n\n1798\n01:33:07,905 --> 01:33:11,825\nIt's neat stuff, but\nsome people don't like that.\n\n1799\n01:33:11,825 --> 01:33:13,405\nSo you need your privacy.\n\n1800\n01:33:13,405 --> 01:33:16,345\nMaybe I'm about to go on\na secret mission for the CIA.\n\n1801\n01:33:16,345 --> 01:33:19,995\nI don't want people to track my GPS so\nI might want to turn that off.\n\n1802\n01:33:19,995 --> 01:33:20,915\nSo you do have that option.\n\n1803\n01:33:20,915 --> 01:33:22,165\nYou'll see I've actually got it off.\n\n1804\n01:33:22,165 --> 01:33:24,325\nLet apps use my location is turned off.\n\n1805\n01:33:24,325 --> 01:33:26,670\nLet apps use my name and\naccount picture, and\n\n1806\n01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:30,160\nhelp improve Windows Store by sending\nURLs, you can turn this stuff on and\n\n1807\n01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:34,480\noff just with a quick flick\nof the old touch screen.\n\n1808\n01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:40,720\n>> Yeah, now going that way, that would\nturn it off for your little profile.\n\n1809\n01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:45,250\nWe can turn turn off in\nthe control panel and\n\n1810\n01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:49,410\nthat can turn it off for\nthose who sign into the machine.\n\n1811\n01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:51,710\n>> And I think that's,\nisn't that in the other screen?\n\n1812\n01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,840\nLet me se if I can get back to it here.\n\n1813\n01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,370\nSo if I go back to here.\n\n1814\n01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:57,370\n>> So yeah.\n\n1815\n01:33:57,370 --> 01:33:59,112\nYou can go to Control Panel > Hardware and\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n1816\n01:33:59,112 --> 01:34:00,746\n>> Let me experiment with this way real\n\n1817\n01:34:00,746 --> 01:34:03,040\nquick, because I think it\ngoes to the same place.\n\n1818\n01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:03,650\nIs this, this it?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1819\n01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:05,290\nControl panel > Hardware > Sound\n>> Okay.\n\n1820\n01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:07,030\nLet me back step a bit, guys.\n\n1821\n01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:10,560\nSo when I went to the modern UI and\nI typed in GPS and\n\n1822\n01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,160\nwent to settings,\nI went to Allow apps to use my location.\n\n1823\n01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,220\nChanged the location settings\nis what Nate's talking about.\n\n1824\n01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,410\nWhat were you saying?\n\n1825\n01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,420\nWindows, key X, and then what?\n\n1826\n01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:23,399\n>> Control Panel > Hardware > Sound, and\n\n1827\n01:34:23,399 --> 01:34:27,790\nthen towards the bottom of the list,\nLocations Settings.\n\n1828\n01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:30,130\nYeah.\nSame menu.\n\n1829\n01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:31,540\n>> Standard Microsoft fashion, right?\n\n1830\n01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:32,845\nTen ways to get to the same thing.\n\n1831\n01:34:32,845 --> 01:34:34,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1832\n01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:35,640\nYeah.\n>> And what we're you saying about,\n\n1833\n01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,340\nthis is for the whole platform, right.\n\n1834\n01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:38,570\n>> Yep, yep, yep, yep, yeah.\n\n1835\n01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:42,660\nGoing through the modern UI style,\nthat will turn it off for\n\n1836\n01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:44,840\nyour little profile that you sign in on.\n\n1837\n01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,050\n>> The individual user?\n\n1838\n01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:46,730\n>> Correct.\n\n1839\n01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:51,310\nAnd going through this way,\nwe'll turn it off for the computer.\n\n1840\n01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:54,620\nNow, there's another way,\nwhere we can do it with a policy.\n\n1841\n01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:55,735\n>> Okay.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1842\n01:34:55,735 --> 01:35:00,670\nAnd we can do it on mine,\nor do it on yours.\n\n1843\n01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:03,130\n>> No, we can go on mine, or\nactually if you know where it is,\n\n1844\n01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,370\nprobably faster for you.\n\n1845\n01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,790\nSo let's say that you work for UPS, and\n\n1846\n01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:09,440\nyou wanna track your\ndrivers by where they are.\n\n1847\n01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:14,760\nIf each of your drivers has a Windows\n8 tablet and it's got a GPS,\n\n1848\n01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:18,590\nyou might wanna hard set it so that\nthey're always doing location awareness.\n\n1849\n01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:20,840\nSo now,\nas the drivers are delivering packages,\n\n1850\n01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,920\nthey'll be out there around town.\n\n1851\n01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,670\nYou'll be able to figure\nout where there are, and\n\n1852\n01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:25,980\nestimate their time of arrival and\nall that.\n\n1853\n01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:28,350\nThey could turn off the GPS tracking,\nthough.\n\n1854\n01:35:28,350 --> 01:35:31,030\nIf we do it through a policy,\nit's not able to be turned off.\n\n1855\n01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:32,980\n>> All right.\n\n1856\n01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:33,570\nLet's see.\n\n1857\n01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:37,741\nIn here, we have mystery of templates,\nwindows,\n\n1858\n01:35:37,741 --> 01:35:42,500\ncomponents, and\nthen down here is location and sensors.\n\n1859\n01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,235\nWe've got.\n\n1860\n01:35:45,235 --> 01:35:47,845\nNot that one, this one.\n\n1861\n01:35:47,845 --> 01:35:48,625\n>> Not that one.\n\n1862\n01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:52,239\n>> This guy right here,\nTurn off location, we can turn,\n\n1863\n01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:55,000\nenable this policy and turn it off for it.\n\n1864\n01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,625\n>> This is one of those weird ones, right?\n\n1865\n01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:58,886\nCuz, you wanna choose Enable,\n\n1866\n01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:03,334\nbecause you're enabling turning\noff the location services.\n\n1867\n01:36:03,334 --> 01:36:07,520\nSo with the Microsoft policies, I would\nsay they're like a double negative, right?\n\n1868\n01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,135\nLike if I wanna turn them on,\nI need to disable turning off location.\n\n1869\n01:36:12,135 --> 01:36:12,710\nRight?\n\n1870\n01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:14,220\nSo it's not very intuitive.\n\n1871\n01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:17,306\nThat's where the little\ndescriptions there are kinda handy.\n\n1872\n01:36:17,306 --> 01:36:17,980\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Yep.\n\n1873\n01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,110\nWe get that to turn the location off.\n\n1874\n01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:22,310\nAnd to take it one step further,\n\n1875\n01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:26,080\nthis next one down here is to\nturn off the sensors altogether.\n\n1876\n01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,710\nOf course, if you turned off the sensors,\nthen that one that we looked at with\n\n1877\n01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:35,835\nits location of course that won't work\n>> Without the sensors turned on.\n\n1878\n01:36:35,835 --> 01:36:39,770\nAnd we're talking about\nthe The power policies.\n\n1879\n01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:42,800\nI'm not, I wonder if we touched on this.\n\n1880\n01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,060\nI was just thinking of it earlier.\n\n1881\n01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:47,170\nBut in, wireless airplane mode.\n\n1882\n01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:48,435\nDid we touch on that?\n\n1883\n01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:50,160\n>> Uh-huh,\nwe didn't talk about airplane mode.\n\n1884\n01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,475\n>> Yeah.\nThey uh-huh,\n\n1885\n01:36:51,475 --> 01:36:55,384\nthe radios in a mobile device,\nthey do use up a bit of power.\n\n1886\n01:36:55,384 --> 01:36:58,963\n>> Hm-mm\n>> Especially if they're searching for\n\n1887\n01:36:58,963 --> 01:37:01,330\nsomething, a cell phone,\n>> hm-mm\n\n1888\n01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:02,650\n>> Searching for a wireless signal that's\n\n1889\n01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,190\nnot there or whatever.\n\n1890\n01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:09,240\n>> And yeah, a quick way to save\na little bit of power, airplane mode.\n\n1891\n01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,200\nIn PC settings.\n\n1892\n01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:14,340\nIs wireless, and when you turn that on\nit will shut down all the radios, and\n\n1893\n01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:15,380\nyeah, save a little bit of power.\n\n1894\n01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:19,450\n>> Yeah, you know the airplane mode\noriginally stemmed from the, want your\n\n1895\n01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:23,500\nwireless signals to interfere with the\nairplanes, and, so you had to turn it off.\n\n1896\n01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:27,060\nAnd it turns out, it doesn't really\ninterfere with the airplanes.\n\n1897\n01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:28,550\nAnd so\nthey're kinda rolling those rules back.\n\n1898\n01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:30,915\nSo now airplane mode is really\njust useful for power saving.\n\n1899\n01:37:30,915 --> 01:37:32,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1900\n01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:33,650\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1901\n01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:35,420\nThat's what I've got for.\n\n1902\n01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:36,200\nYeah.\n\n1903\n01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,580\n>> Awesome.\n>> Location settings and\n\n1904\n01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,712\nthe policies to turn that off.\n\n1905\n01:37:38,712 --> 01:37:42,650\n>> All right So the point of this\nwhole objective was that there's.\n\n1906\n01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:45,510\nThings that are different on\nmobile device than a desktop.\n\n1907\n01:37:45,510 --> 01:37:47,200\nThings like battery power.\n\n1908\n01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,390\nThings like GPS and\nlocation awareness, remote wipe.\n\n1909\n01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:52,642\nThat stuff that we just\ndon't need with a desktop.\n\n1910\n01:37:52,642 --> 01:37:53,730\nAll right?\n\n1911\n01:37:53,730 --> 01:37:56,480\neverything else, as far as running\nWindows on top of a laptop,\n\n1912\n01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,110\nis pretty much the same.\n\n1913\n01:37:58,110 --> 01:38:00,000\nSo, these are just some of the highlights.\n\n1914\n01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,570\nAnd Microsoft likes to call that out\nspecially because laptops are now so\n\n1915\n01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:05,480\nprevalent, right?\n\n1916\n01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,843\nPrevalent enough to have\nan entire objective.\n\n1917\n01:38:07,843 --> 01:38:10,889\nThe whole 6.0 objective is, or\n\n1918\n01:38:10,889 --> 01:38:15,550\n5.0 if I can get the right objective,\nis all about mobility, mobile devices.\n\n1919\n01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:19,570\n>> Yeah, and especially with the\n>> Enormous success with\n\n1920\n01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:22,290\nthe Surface tablets out there in.\n\n1921\n01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:24,500\n>> Are you predicting a success?\n\n1922\n01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:25,025\n>> What?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1923\n01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:26,880\n>> It happened, I thought.\n\n1924\n01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,940\n>> They did a billion dollar charge back.\n\n1925\n01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:30,640\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1926\n01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,444\n>> All right,\n\n1927\n01:38:31,444 --> 01:38:33,620\nI've been a Microsoft purist.\n\n1928\n01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:37,340\nBut yeah,\nwith the Surface tablets [INAUDIBLE]\n\n1929\n01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:37,906\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1930\n01:38:37,906 --> 01:38:38,542\n>> Yeah,\n\n1931\n01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:41,941\nbut those guys, they're out there.\n\n1932\n01:38:41,941 --> 01:38:43,670\n>> Hm-mm\n>> Easy.\n\n1933\n01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:45,960\nBack up your polices and\npush those guys out.\n\n1934\n01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:50,000\nMobility is just becoming more and\nmore in your face.\n\n1935\n01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,912\nI guess.\n\n1936\n01:38:50,912 --> 01:38:54,099\nI don't know\n>> It's in your face\n\n1937\n01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:57,410\n>> I was trying to go somewhere, but\n\n1938\n01:38:57,410 --> 01:39:01,026\nI just didn't know where I was gonna go.\n\n1939\n01:39:01,026 --> 01:39:02,850\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1940\n01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:04,560\nWell I think that's all\nwe got on mobility.\n\n1941\n01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,660\nI don't have anything else to

didn't.\n\n22\n00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,190\n>> So, so\nyou didn't bet on Cincinnati did you?\n\n23\n00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,170\n>> No, I have poor Cincinnati.\n\n24\n00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,210\nSomebody else, there's another upset too.\n\n25\n00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,650\n>> Yeah.\nSome twelve c got somebody else.\n\n26\n00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,910\n>> Yeah\n>> I, I, read it

your bracket\non in Cincinnati, well you're toast and\n\n29\n00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,120\nthat's pretty much about it, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,370\nSo, so for us here as we are moving onto\nthis final topic that we have to finish\n\n31\n00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:32,580\nup all the content as we have been going\nback through and hitting the portions that\n\n32\n00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,380\nwe needed to cover since in January\nof 2014 they updated the exam.\n\n33\n00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,520\nInstead of just Windows 8.1,\nit is now, or Windows 8, excuse me.\n\n34\n00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,210\nNow, it is actually going\nthrough the Windows 8.1 and\n\n35\n00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,710\nthese particular topics that\nwe've been covering are not.\n\n36\n00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,520\nThat they haven't been there, but\n\n37\n00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,948\nthat on the new exam that they\ncalled them out specifically.\n\n38\n00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,900\nSo want to make sure that we address\nall those topics that are now caught up\n\n39\n00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,170\nspecifically here and this one for\nus Nate is what topic are we covering for\n\n40\n00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,276\nour final?\n\n41\n00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:07,181\n>> Let's see you know what let skip\nright on over here so we are in the,\n\n42\n00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:10,953\nthe Windows 8 70-687 and\n[NOISE] scrolling on down.\n\n43\n00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:12,277\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look at that.\n\n44\n00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:14,710\nAll the blue means we've covered it.\n\n45\n00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,850\nThere it is.\n\n46\n00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,800\nSo, under configure remote access and\nmobility,\n\n47\n00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,519\nwe have that last remaining little guy,\nnumber six, Configure Broadband Tethering.\n\n48\n00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,975\n>> Yeah.\nSo, configure broadband tethering,\n\n49\n00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:27,680\nnow pretty neat.\n\n50\n00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,298\nPretty, pretty cool stuff.\n\n51\n00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:31,270\nSo, Windows 8.1 It fully,\n\n52\n00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,100\ncompletely supports th,\nthose little wireless aircards.\n\n53\n00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,163\nSo, you know, back in the day\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:39,290\n>> The earlier days that [LAUGH] I guess,\n\n55\n00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,760\nback in the days,\n>> Back in the day.\n\n56\n00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,058\n>> however long that is but, you know,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:44,115\n>> You have to load up a\n\n58\n00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:44,975\n>> You know these third party\n\n59\n00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:49,493\ndrivers these these utilities and programs\nto manage these air cards but not anymore.\n\n60\n00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:52,165\n>> No.\n>> Windows 8.1 fully supports it and so\n\n61\n00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:56,355\nyou can just pop that guy in and\nuse Windows 8.1 to manage that,\n\n62\n00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:57,695\nthat wireless card.\n\n63\n00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:58,375\n>> Yeah.\n\n64\n00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,875\nAnd now it terms of the idea of broadband\ntethering, the strange thing is,\n\n65\n00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,055\nI have to admit something, I remember\nthe days of broadband tethering,\n\n66\n00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:08,390\nbut not a lot of people do anymore\n>> Because of the advent of\n\n67\n00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,850\nthings like smart phones, and tablets that\nalready have these things built into them.\n\n68\n00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,790\nSo it used to be where you would go out\nto your service provider for, your,\n\n69\n00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,530\nyour smart phone and you would tell them,\nhey, I want to connect in another device,\n\n70\n00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,930\nsuch as my laptop into that, that data\nplan that I actually have as well.\n\n71\n00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,980\n>> Now when you do that they would again\nissue you a smart card or an air card.\n\n72\n00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,190\nI went ahead and did a Google search\nhere on the idea of air cards for us.\n\n73\n00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,540\nAnd so you might have seen some of these.\n\n74\n00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,290\nYou might not have ever seen\nsome of these depending on,\n\n75\n00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,390\non your experience with laptops and stuff.\n\n76\n00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,350\nSo like, like oo, here's a,\nhere's a neat one.\n\n77\n00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,430\nNate, have you, have you ever seen\none of these, these babies here?\n\n78\n00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,790\n>> You know I, I haven't.\n\n79\n00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,410\nIt, it looks, it looks familiar.\n\n80\n00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,960\nBut you know, for you know, Wi-Fi, but not\nfor any, any cellular, cellular business.\n\n81\n00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,880\n>> Yeah.\n\n82\n00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,460\nYeah, this is actually from that old pc\ncard bus technology that we used to find,\n\n83\n00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,200\neven older than that.\n\n84\n00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,710\nWe used to call it PCMCIA.\n\n85\n00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,810\nAnd we would actually be able\nto slide this card in there, and\n\n86\n00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,250\nat one time I remember my very first modem\nactually came on a card like this for\n\n87\n00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,560\na, for a laptop for us.\n\n88\n00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,510\nBut, notice that it actually\ndoes say the ID of an air card.\n\n89\n00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:25,140\nSo this, instead of me connecting in\nthrough just a wi-fi at some hotspot,\n\n90\n00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,390\nlike if you know, like at a coffee shop or\nat a fast food joint here.\n\n91\n00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,850\nI actually had my direct\nconnection into the data plan,\n\n92\n00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,200\nthe same, usually the same carrier as\nwhat your smart phone would be on.\n\n93\n00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,900\nAnd, that way you'd be directly\nconnected to the internet,\n\n94\n00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,420\nokay, is what we have here.\n\n95\n00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,340\nNow, these have actually advanced\na little bit further than that, okay.\n\n96\n00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,170\nFo, In, in this,\nif I could actually click on it,\n\n97\n00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,530\n>> And so here's, Nate loves this guy.\n\n98\n00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:57,230\n>> Yeah, so that one right there, that\nSprint one, you may want to shop around.\n\n99\n00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,540\nJust kidding, but I have a, Sprint is my\nwireless carrier and here in Gainsville.\n\n100\n00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,270\nThe coverage,\nis a bit more spotty than other carriers.\n\n101\n00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,450\n>> Yeah.\n>> So I rag on poor Sprint.\n\n102\n00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,730\n>> And that's going to be\ntrue with any of them right?\n\n103\n00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,740\nIt depends on the actual service,\nand the carrier that you have.\n\n104\n00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,780\nDepending on the connection\nthat you're going to get.\n\n105\n00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,160\nBut notice that this one is actually a USB\nconnection, is pretty much the key here.\n\n106\n00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,580\nNow they come in all varying sizes.\n\n107\n00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,690\nThis one I guess, would be the size of\na bottle cap or something, maybe a little\n\n108\n00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:34,980\nbit larger and then they come just\nlike a like a USB thumb drive, right?\n\n109\n00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,650\nSo, this one looks like a thumb drive,\ngo and try and write data to it,\n\n110\n00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,440\nyou're probably not going to be\nvery happy, but in this sense here.\n\n111\n00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,690\nThis actually the antenna that connects\nyou into you data plan at that\n\n112\n00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,530\npoint, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,920\nSo there are many different ones that\nwe used to actually be able to see, and\n\n114\n00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,460\nbuy, but\n\n115\n00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,220\nmost people today though, we don't tend\nto actually do things like that anymore.\n\n116\n00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,190\nBecause you actually see things like this,\nright.\n\n117\n00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,980\n>> Mhm.\n>> The idea, w-, what is this?\n\n118\n00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,140\nWe, we, we joke around, we call it\nthe meefee, but it's actually called what?\n\n119\n00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,180\n>> Yeah, meefee and mifi.\n\n120\n00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,840\n>> Mifi. [LAUGH] >> Mifi.\n\n121\n00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,780\nSo yeah, so, so these devices right here,\nso unlike the ones we just saw before\n\n122\n00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,140\nthat, plug in usb and genereally it\nwould plug into just one computer.\n\n123\n00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,120\n>> One pc.\n\n124\n00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,240\nWell now a days you know,\n\n125\n00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,250\nmore popular than those those little\ncards are these is myfi's right?\n\n126\n00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,560\nThis one right here by Verizon and these\noperate just like a like a mobile hotspot.\n\n127\n00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,620\nSo you just plug this device in it\nwould set you know, next to your pc or\n\n128\n00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,820\nin some central location.\n\n129\n00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,515\nI mean you know, you couldn't\ngo too far way from these guys.\n\n130\n00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:36,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But then yeah,\n\n131\n00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,960\nthey just broadcast out that that,\nthat you know signal and\n\n132\n00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,130\nyou just connect to it\nlike a wireless hotspot.\n\n133\n00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,910\n>> Yep all right.\n\n134\n00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,070\nSo Nate kind of gave us the key here\n\n135\n00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,250\non what the big difference really\nis between both of those, right?\n\n136\n00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,820\nThe original air cards allowed you\nthat one device to connect in, okay.\n\n137\n00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,720\nAnd then that was pretty much it.\n\n138\n00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,890\nIt was limited that way.\n\n139\n00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,790\nThe MiFi cards and stuff that you can\nactually carry around with you and\n\n140\n00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,710\njust set beside you if you're sitting\nthere at a, you know, at a restaurant,\n\n141\n00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,000\nif you want to you know.\n\n142\n00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,330\nMultiple devices could connect in as well,\nokay?\n\n143\n00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,470\nTo be able to offer them the same type\nof connecting into the internet, if,\n\n144\n00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,190\nif you want to, okay?\n\n145\n00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,710\nNow, what we're talking about here today\nis that Windows 8.1 supports the ability\n\n146\n00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:29,280\nto do, essentially,\nthe same thing as the MiFi does,\n\n147\n00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,810\nbut with just the idea of an air card,\nokay?\n\n148\n00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,700\nNow, the way that it does it is that 8.1\ngives you the ability that once you,\n\n149\n00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,520\nactually, plug in that\ndevice into your laptop or\n\n150\n00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,630\nwhatever it is that you\nwanna plug it into, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,780\nIt gives you the ability to support up to,\nwell, ten actual connections then.\n\n152\n00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,110\nSo that turns your laptop into a mi-fi,\nis what it really does for us.\n\n153\n00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,700\nSo, so in that sense,\nit can be a great benefit.\n\n154\n00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:01,450\nOr it could have been.\n\n155\n00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,410\nThe reason why I say it could have been\nis because most of us today, we probably\n\n156\n00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,860\ncarrying around our own devices in which\nwe would tether our own laptop to anyways,\n\n157\n00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,650\nif your, if your data plan supports that,\nI shouldn't say that you should do that,\n\n158\n00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,640\nwithout doing that.\n\n159\n00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,520\nYeah, but, if your data plan supports it I\ncan actually just use my smart phone and\n\n160\n00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,462\nactually connect that way.\n\n161\n00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,200\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n162\n00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,872\n>> Not that I would do that to my carrier,\nbut.\n\n163\n00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:23,480\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,140\n>> Yeah yeah.\n\n165\n00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,220\nYeah, no doubt.\n\n166\n00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,030\nYou know, and.\n\n167\n00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, and with,\n\n168\n00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,870\nwith these air cards of course,\nyou know, I mean they,\n\n169\n00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,645\nthey do use the, the,\nthe cellular connection.\n\n170\n00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n171\n00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,840\n>> And, you know, and\ndepending on the, you know,\n\n172\n00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,210\ndifferent wireless carriers,\ndifferent you know,\n\n173\n00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,415\nnetwork plans will need to be purchased,\nyou know, for those air cards.\n\n174\n00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:40,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Of course,\n\n175\n00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,730\nyou know, depending on\n>> Oh you know, the different carriers and\n\n176\n00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,590\nwhat plans that are out there.\n\n177\n00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,367\nBut the speed of the air card will\nbe dependent upon the wireless\n\n178\n00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,163\ncarrier\n>> Yeah.\n\n179\n00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:50,160\nThat you go with.\n\n180\n00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,590\nAnd signal strength and reliability and\n\n181\n00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:58,275\nthose sorts of things will vary from card\nto card depending on who you get it from.\n\n182\n00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,012\n>> Yeah?\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n183\n00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:01,790\n>> All right, so what we would\nlove to be able to do right now\n\n184\n00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,525\nis tell you we found an air card\n>> Well, we didn't.\n\n185\n00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:10,600\n[LAUGH] But so, but we can at least\ntell you about what can happen and\n\n186\n00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,730\nat least to a portion\nof what you will see.\n\n187\n00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,200\nNow this really does depend on\nthe actual air card that you have\n\n188\n00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,460\nwhat you will actually to be able to see,\nso I'm going to go ahead and\n\n189\n00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,980\njust bring up my desktop here on my and\nand\n\n190\n00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,950\njust show you at least the steps\nthat you would normally have, okay?\n\n191\n00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,850\nNow for\nus we can't see the lower left hand\n\n192\n00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,600\ncorner of the screen run it full-size.\n\n193\n00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,250\n>> Can we, can we go full screen here?\n\n194\n00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,910\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then we should be able to see it.\n\n195\n00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:41,460\nSo, on the lower left-hand corner of the\nscreen, if you had that wireless air card,\n\n196\n00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,100\ncard connected in through your USB port.\n\n197\n00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,470\nI have to, actually,\ngo to the charm bar here.\n\n198\n00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,240\nOn the charm bar, I would click on\nsettings and what you're really looking\n\n199\n00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,620\nfor is the connection that you\nhave actually right here, okay?\n\n200\n00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,510\nNow on that connection, if you actually\nhave that, oops, that connection here.\n\n201\n00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,770\nYou could then at this point here,\nselect that connection, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,460\nAnd then one of those options if it\nhad the availability to do that is for\n\n203\n00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,150\nyou to actually right click and\nsay share this connection.\n\n204\n00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,060\nNow that would actually ensure for us that\nwhat we would have is the ability for\n\n205\n00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,890\nup to ten devices connect in.\n\n206\n00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,020\nYou'd have to have a fairly long password.\n\n207\n00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,940\nI say fairly long,\nat least eight characters long.\n\n208\n00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,830\nOkay?\n\n209\n00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,210\nSo whoever you want to connect into,\n\n210\n00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,700\nwould actually at least have to\nhave that for them to do that.\n\n211\n00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,840\nAnd once that's done, then all the other\ndevices that would actually see that\n\n212\n00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,300\nnow in their list of network connections\ncan select it, type in their password and\n\n213\n00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,096\nthey could connect,\nto the internet through your device.\n\n214\n00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,160\n>> Huh.\nYeah, you know, and with the you know,\n\n215\n00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,620\nwith, with these air cards and\nwhat not, you know.\n\n216\n00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,050\nOf course this would fall under\nthe the category of a metered connection.\n\n217\n00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,970\n>> Yeah.\nAnd then, so then all the policies and\n\n218\n00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,100\nthe settings and\nthe things that you need to set for\n\n219\n00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,480\nmetered connections that you know,\nwill also apply to the air-card you know,\n\n220\n00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,110\nmake sure that computers aren't running\naway with lots of updates or downloads or\n\n221\n00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,375\nthings of that sort to try\nto keep the data usage down.\n\n222\n00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,540\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n223\n00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,630\nthrough the metered connection you\ncan also track the data usage and\n\n224\n00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,730\nkeep an eye on that so you don't blow\nout those, those bandwidth caps.\n\n225\n00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,510\n>> Yeah, because all that is still\nrelatively expensive, right?\n\n226\n00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,880\nThe one that I just saw there\nsaid 6 gigs for $60 dollars.\n\n227\n00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,154\nThat's pretty hefty.\n\n228\n00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:35,765\n[LAUGH] You go over that limit there,\nbut 60 bucks you know, just for 6 gigs.\n\n229\n00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:38,210\nNate would blow that away in\nfive minutes on his laptop.\n\n230\n00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,200\n>> Yeah,\nthat's like not even a 1080p movie.\n\n231\n00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,340\n>> Yeah.\n\n232\n00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,970\n>> Oh, I know, it's, shoot,\nyou need 25 gigs for those.\n\n233\n00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,990\n>> Good gracious.\n\n234\n00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,610\n>> Six?\n\n235\n00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,430\nBut I mean, yeah you know, it's,\nif you're out on the go and\n\n236\n00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,715\nyou know, without you know,\nwi-fi from some place.\n\n237\n00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:54,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And I mean, yeah, shoot.\n\n238\n00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,000\nIt would be great to, you know,\nfor e-mail or checking on,\n\n239\n00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,760\non the brackets these days.\n\n240\n00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then,\n\n241\n00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,320\nhave the ability to connect in and\njust get whatever you need in a pinch.\n\n242\n00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n243\n00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,790\nSo it, it does make sense sometimes,\nright?\n\n244\n00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,560\nIn a pinch, probably a good idea.\n\n245\n00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,900\nBut most of the people today,\n\n246\n00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,250\nlike we said, you're probably gonna see\nwith most of the devices running 8.1.\n\n247\n00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,544\nYou're going to see people using them, but\n\n248\n00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:20,240\nthey're probably gonna\nconnect into the local wi-fi.\n\n249\n00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,080\nThat they have available more often than,\nactually, going out and\n\n250\n00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,655\ndoing broadband tethering on their own.\n\n251\n00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:25,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n252\n00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,680\n>> Yeah.\n\n253\n00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,840\n>> Yeah.\nYou know, and yeah, it it also said,\n\n254\n00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,330\nyou know, in Windows 8.1 that, you know,\nbecause it does fully support the you\n\n255\n00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,700\nknow, these air cards without any you\nknow, third party utilities and the sort.\n\n256\n00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,880\nThat you know, within the network\nsettings pane, you can now view the your,\n\n257\n00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,500\nyour wireless plan to be able to make\nadjustments through the network settings\n\n258\n00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,570\nfor that wireless carrier.\n\n259\n00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,430\nYeah, sweet stuff, you know,\nthe amazing thing that yeah\n\n260\n00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,320\nI mean you complete manage that device,\nwithout anything else.\n\n261\n00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,110\n>> Yeah, so no need to external add-in\n>> For\n\n262\n00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,018\ndrivers, because a lot them are built in,\n\n263\n00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:07,040\nin terms of control, a lot more control\njust through the operating system, so\n\n264\n00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,060\nno need to have to learn about\na different application as well.\n\n265\n00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,630\nShould be seamless, and\nfits right in with a 4.1.\n\n266\n00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,400\n>> So Ronny, so so\nat your place you have via satellite\n\n267\n00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,133\n>> I have satellite.\n\n268\n00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,420\n>> Satellite internet\n>> I do.\n\n269\n00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,086\n>> You know, I just, it's funny,\n\n270\n00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:25,830\ncause I've only read about satell,\nsatellites internet in books.\n\n271\n00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,330\n>> Right.\n>> And things.\n\n272\n00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:32,050\nI've never really lived in\nan area [LAUGH] where you know,\n\n273\n00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,640\nyou actually had to, had to use it.\n\n274\n00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,210\n>> Right.\n\n275\n00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> So in, in your area, would you,\n\n276\n00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,020\nwould you consider a hanging up your\nsatellite internet and moving to a like\n\n277\n00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:47,000\na MiFi and use your, your laptop there to\ntether your internet and other devices.\n\n278\n00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,540\n>> If, okay, and this is a big if,\nif the actual cost were comparable,\n\n279\n00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,528\nyes, I would do it, but\nthe cost is not comparable.\n\n280\n00:13:56,528 --> 00:14:00,870\nIf the, 5 gigs on a data plan is\nstill fairly expensive, so, you know,\n\n281\n00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,510\nmine is, is not exactly inexpensive.\n\n282\n00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,875\nIt is much better than that.\n\n283\n00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n284\n00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,630\n>> So\n>> Yeah, the satellite connection is,\n\n285\n00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,310\nis, is, it's good, as long as, you know,\nyou don't have anything else to go to.\n\n286\n00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,150\n>> All right.\n\n287\n00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,120\n>> Yep.\n>> So, all right, so then, okay, so then,\n\n288\n00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,790\nfor these, these wifi cards,\nright, these, these air cards.\n\n289\n00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,090\nWhat kinda scenarios would, would you say\nthat, would warrant something like this.\n\n290\n00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> Like, travelling salesperson,\n\n291\n00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,550\nI got a company issued.\n\n292\n00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,170\n>> Sure!\n>> Yeah.\n\n293\n00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,090\n>> Something like that?\n\n294\n00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,600\n>> Yeah.\nIf, if you want to talk\n\n295\n00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,210\nabout the idea of scenarios, right?\n\n296\n00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,170\nWhere you might actually have this is,\nlet's say that you actually do\n\n297\n00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,340\nschedule a business meeting and,\nin that particular meeting,\n\n298\n00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,160\nyou're not sure whether or\nnot you have connection to the internet,\n\n299\n00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,810\nif you actually have to get access to,\nto either some corporate resources or\n\n300\n00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,500\nyou just have to actually get\nconnections somewhere outside.\n\n301\n00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,250\nSo if you're actually in an area with,\nwhere they say nope, we're secure,\n\n302\n00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,890\nwe don't actually offer any wifi, the\nability to actually be able to bring one\n\n303\n00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,440\nof these, devices along, gives you that\nability to connect but also offers you\n\n304\n00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,580\nthe ability to have other people connect\nthrough you and not have to worry about.\n\n305\n00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,420\nViolating someone elses security policy\nand putting other things in, in place.\n\n306\n00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,980\nSo it could be in a meeting\nthat you actually need it.\n\n307\n00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,050\nYou could do that and\nshare that out very quickly.\n\n308\n00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,610\nIt could be that you're\nmobile at the point.\n\n309\n00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,165\nYou actually want to do a working\nlunch with a couple of other people,\n\n310\n00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:18,135\nthis might be the way to go.\n\n311\n00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:22,317\n>> Now with, so\nbecause you will be connecting to the,\n\n312\n00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:27,145\ni guess the cellular network, it sill\nwould be considered an untrusted network.\n\n313\n00:15:27,145 --> 00:15:28,302\n>> It is.\n>> It still is connected.\n\n314\n00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,087\nTo, to the internet.\n\n315\n00:15:29,087 --> 00:15:31,652\n>> Yep.\nNow so with the, you know,\n\n316\n00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:33,132\nthe air card I mean,\n\n317\n00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,852\njust like with Wi-Fi, you would still be\nable to connect to your company's VPN and\n\n318\n00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,602\nconnect through things that way and still\nbe able to securely work away from home.\n\n319\n00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:42,022\n>> Yeah.\nAs long as you\n\n320\n00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:44,872\ndon't go over your data plan limit,\nI think you're fine.\n\n321\n00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:45,982\nOver a metered connection,\n\n322\n00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:49,410\nyou're probably not going to want to\ndo too much of that but it can be done.\n\n323\n00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,675\nYes.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n324\n00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:51,456\nNice.\n\n325\n00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:52,237\n>> Yeah.\n\n326\n00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:53,407\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n327\n00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:54,190\n>> Yeah.\n\n328\n00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:54,800\n>> All right.\n\n329\n00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,560\n>> Yeah.\nFor us, that, that's the idea, okay?\n\n330\n00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,470\nSo, don't,\ndon't just discount this totally.\n\n331\n00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,710\nYou go oh, oh I know a way to do it.\n\n332\n00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,335\nWhich is fine.\n\n333\n00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:06,010\nUh,remember that this is actually a good,\nplan for\n\n334\n00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,040\nyou, especially if you don't want to talk\nabout the idea of moving towards 8.1.\n\n335\n00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,330\nFor your organization, and you wanna\ntalk about some of the extra benefits,\n\n336\n00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,970\nthat's actually allowed,\nright there is one of 'em.\n\n337\n00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,400\nSo don't forget that for us, most of us\ntoday have kind of, I hate to say it,\n\n338\n00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,270\ngone past this particular generation\nof technology, because we do have so\n\n339\n00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,490\nmany other devices that help us do this.\n\n340\n00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,940\nBut, in a pinch, it works incredi,\nincredibly well.\n\n341\n00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,840\nAnd actually works incredibly seamlessly,\nso it's worth, it's worth a look.\n\n342\n00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,300\n>> Yeah, you know, and from a,\na management point of view, right.\n\n343\n00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,580\nOr an administrative point of view,\nthat you know,\n\n344\n00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,570\nperhaps if the company is ruling out\nyou know, a number of these devices.\n\n345\n00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,860\nThat, you don't have to go\nout to each persons pc,\n\n346\n00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,020\nand install a Verizon utility, or\nsome kind of management program.\n\n347\n00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,260\nThat, you know it's easy with 8.1.\n\n348\n00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,030\nIt supports it all up.\n\n349\n00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,870\nLess software, less configuration.\n\n350\n00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,800\nEasier for the end devices.\n\n351\n00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,470\n>> All right.\n\n352\n00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,700\n>> Or end users, and easier to manage.\n\n353\n00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,580\nThat's it, yeah.\n\n354\n00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,280\nYeah, I think that's,\nthat's all that I have on,\n\n355\n00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,960\non broadband tethering which\nI can't say this morning.\n\n356\n00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,280\nAny other thoughts that\nyou might think of?\n\n357\n00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,065\n>> Yeah, no that's yeah, that's.\n\n358\n00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:15,015\nThat's good, that's good for now.\n\n359\n00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,245\nRonnie if if you get one.\n\n360\n00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,905\n>> Yeah.\n>> You should let me borrow it.\n\n361\n00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:18,995\n>> I should.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:21,715\n>> But I wouldn't [LAUGH].\n\n363\n00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:22,995\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n364\n00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:25,825\nThe way that you blow away data\ncap limits there's no way.\n\n365\n00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:26,545\nYeah.\n\n366\n00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,000\n>> And yeah it.\n\n367\n00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,460\nYeah, it only happened once though,\nyou know, you do it one time and\n\n368\n00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,490\nthey never live it down.\n\n369\n00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,165\n>> Yeah, I wonder why?\n\n370\n00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:34,530\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well good deal.\n\n371\n00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,040\nWell, if you ever have any questions\nduring the show be sure to jump right in.\n\n372\n00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,125\nWe've got the chat monitor.\n\n373\n00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,005\nPulled up.\nWe drop stuff in there.\n\n374\n00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:45,165\nWe, we monitor it and respond to it right,\nright here on the show.\n\n375\n00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:49,385\nIf you have any questions after the show,\nbe sure to check out the Q&A section.\n\n376\n00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:52,410\nThere's a little link for it at\nthe top of every page of our website.\n\n377\n00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,620\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And if you're ever away from the PC and\n\n378\n00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,700\nstill wanna tune in,\nwe do have a roku channel.\n\n379\n00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,240\nYou can jump on there and watch Ronnie\nin high def on your projector, tv.\n\n380\n00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,760\nIt

with\n\n390\n00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,510\nanswers rather than more questions, so\nlet us know when you do have questions.\n\n391\n00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,040\nHm.\n\n392\n00:18:28,040 -->

back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,810\nWelcome back to blue shirt day.\n\n5\n00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,270\n>> That's right, blue shirt day.\n\n6\n00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,980\n>> I'm your host Don Pezet,\naccompanied today by Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,870\nHow's it going Wes?\n\n8\n00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,370\n>> It's going okay.\n\n9\n00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,440\nI think we got to get\nour tailors together and\n\n10\n00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,800\ntell them to you know like,\njust shift the pattern a little bit.\n\n11\n00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,280\n>> You know, honestly when you go back and\n\n12\n00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,330\nwatch these episodes recorded\nit's like it's a father-son team.\n\n13\n00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,900\nBecause you know, you make me\nlook shorter just standing there.\n\n14\n00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,990\nAnd then we dress the same.\n\n15\n00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,010\nSee, it's like you're taking\nme to a baseball game.\n\n16\n00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,668\n>> Now I am the master.\n\n17\n00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:07,460\n>> [LAUGH]\nSo, anyhow,\n\n18\n00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,570\nwe got stuff to talk about today\n>> Yes.\n\n19\n00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,475\nYes.\n>> And we might as well do that.\n\n20\n00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:15,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So like I said, this is a Windows 8\n\n21\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,838\nshow and we are just cruising right\nalong with our objectives today.\n\n22\n00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:21,100\nWe are gonna be jumping into\nobjective six, which is monitor and\n\n23\n00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,920\nmaintain Windows clients.\n\n24\n00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,200\nThis is one of those that\nis a pretty big objective.\n\n25\n00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,910\nSo we'll probably have to\nbreak it up into two episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,160\nSo I've gone ahead and\nflagged this one as part one.\n\n27\n00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,074\n>> And then we'll have part two, Revenge\nof the Sith, or something like that.\n\n28\n00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:37,966\n>> Yes, yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:38,690\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n30\n00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,855\nthat'll be our exciting conclusion.\n\n31\n00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:43,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But so, we got a lot of neat stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,540\nWe're gonna start by talking\nabout Windows updates, and\n\n33\n00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,120\nthen we're gonna move into some\nfile stuff, see some of the neat\n\n34\n00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,670\ndrive things that we can do in Windows 8,\nand have some fun there.\n\n35\n00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,040\n>> Yep.\n\n36\n00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,220\n>> All right, so Wes,\nlet's jump into Windows updates.\n\n37\n00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,820\n>> Windows updates.\n\n38\n00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,070\nI think we should start by\ntaking about what an update is.\n\n39\n00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,390\nI mean why would we even need them.\n\n40\n00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,290\nAnd we've got a series.\n\n41\n00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,010\nThey fall into a few different\ncategories but largely speaking,\n\n42\n00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,330\nan update is about some kinda supplemental\ncode that usually fixes some kinda\n\n43\n00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,510\nfunctionality flaw in\nthe operating system.\n\n44\n00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,380\nAnd a lot of times, it's really about\nsome kinda remote security exploit.\n\n45\n00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,520\n>> So they are very important.\n\n46\n00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,150\nWe've got a few different types.\n\n47\n00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,410\nWe've got what's just called a patch.\n\n48\n00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,430\nPatches usually come out\nsecond Tuesday of every month.\n\n49\n00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,280\nLegendary Microsoft's Patch Tuesday,\nif you will.\n\n50\n00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,002\nWe got something known as a hotfix.\n\n51\n00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:29,690\nA hotfix is the same thing as a patch but\n\n52\n00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,330\nit's one of these security exploits\nthat they've got to get out right away.\n\n53\n00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,310\nWe can't wait until the second\nTuesday of every month.\n\n54\n00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,810\nAnd finally we have what\nare called service packs, and\n\n55\n00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,810\nservice packs is you know, just an entire\ncompilation of prior patches and\n\n56\n00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,800\nthen additional software as well.\n\n57\n00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,280\n>> Yeah, Microsoft had\nan embarrassing moment years ago\n\n58\n00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,910\nwhere they released an update that\nintroduced a new functionality,\n\n59\n00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,820\nwhich also introduced some bugs and\ncaused some critical systems to fail.\n\n60\n00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,850\nSo they started getting\nreally strict about it and\n\n61\n00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,610\nthe way that it works, every Tuesday they\nrelease those patches, like Wes said.\n\n62\n00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,810\nAnd those patches do not\nintroduce new functionality.\n\n63\n00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,580\nAll right, they only fix old functionality\nand that might be bugs or exploits or\n\n64\n00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,680\nwhatever, right?.\n\n65\n00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,340\nBut the service packs, a service pack\nwill roll up a whole collection of\n\n66\n00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,480\nthose fixes and the service packs\nused to contain new features,\n\n67\n00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,634\nthey actually stopped that, and\nnow we have these new releases, right?\n\n68\n00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:28,150\n>> Yeah.\nYep.\n\n69\n00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,350\n>> So you have Windows Server 2012,\n\n70\n00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,400\nWindows Server 2012 R2, or\nWindows 8, now we have Windows 8.1,\n\n71\n00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,080\nand that's where our new features and\nfunctionality come in.\n\n72\n00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,410\n>> Yeah, one of the last, and\nspeaking of you know, additional software,\n\n73\n00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,460\none of the major ones that I can think of\nis all the way back to Windows XP service\n\n74\n00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,880\npack two, brings in the firewall,\nbrings in the window defender.\n\n75\n00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,310\nLater on in XP service pack three\nwe get things like support for\n\n76\n00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,880\ndigital rights management and\nwhat we'll talk about in some of other\n\n77\n00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,380\nmore advanced Microsoft classes like\nsupport for Network Access Protection.\n\n78\n00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,970\nThat's the last one that I can think of.\n\n79\n00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,700\n>> And they took a lot of heat for that.\n\n80\n00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,320\nSuddenly you have a company\nwith a thousand machines and\n\n81\n00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,790\nthey'd come in and not only was the\nfirewall installed but it was turned on.\n\n82\n00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,880\nAnd now they couldn't remote\nmanage the systems and\n\n83\n00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,060\nthey were effectively locked out,\nit was a nightmare.\n\n84\n00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,610\nYou had Outlook clients where they\ncouldn't see they got new e-mails\n\n85\n00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,690\nfrom the server cuz\nthe firewall was blocking it.\n\n86\n00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,210\nYeah, Microsoft took a lot of heat.\n\n87\n00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,770\n>> So that's why they started\ndoing these R2 releases, and\n\n88\n00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,460\nit's just to make sure that companies are\naware that new functionality is coming in.\n\n89\n00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,240\nBut new functionality's fine.\n\n90\n00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,350\nWe care about the fixes.\n\n91\n00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,020\nRight?\n>> Yes, yes, definitely.\n\n92\n00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,770\n>> The patches, and the hotfixes.\n\n93\n00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,460\nCuz if there's an exploit,\nif somebody's gonna take over machine,\n\n94\n00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,280\nI need that fix as quickly as possible.\n\n95\n00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,260\n>> Yeah, it's not only just\na functionality flaws, but\n\n96\n00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,780\nwe also have things like driver updates.\n\n97\n00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,440\nDrivers make their way into\nthe Windows update after the operating\n\n98\n00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,950\nsystem's been released, because there's\na lot of different hardware out there.\n\n99\n00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,560\nAnd they can't just get everything bundled\ninto the operating system prior to\n\n100\n00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,080\nits release.\n\n101\n00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,730\nSo you'll see the third-party drivers come\nout after the operating system's released.\n\n102\n00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,240\nAnd, then, I guess it does increase\nour functionality being able to\n\n103\n00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,040\nuse the device.\n\n104\n00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,080\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,860\n>> But you'll see drivers\n\n106\n00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,700\nin there as well.\n\n107\n00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,430\n>> Yep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n108\n00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,320\n>> Now, setting up Windows\nupdate is really easy because\n\n109\n00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,750\nMicrosoft really jams it down your throat.\n\n110\n00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,990\nWhen you're installing Windows 8\nit asks as part of the install\n\n111\n00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,665\nif you bought it from a vendor or whatever\nit asks the first time it boots up.\n\n112\n00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,965\nYou know, do you wanna turn\non automatic updates, right?\n\n113\n00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:25,675\nAnd then that's the way they phrase it,\nright, automatic updates.\n\n114\n00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:30,455\nIf you say yes to that question,\nthen at 3 AM every day,\n\n115\n00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,610\nyour computer will reach out to Microsoft\nand say hey, are there any updates for me?\n\n116\n00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,590\nAnd if there are, it'll download them and\ninstall them, and\n\n117\n00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,180\nmore than likely reboot your computer.\n\n118\n00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,060\nMost of the updates too require a reboot.\n\n119\n00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,370\nBut you don't have to slave away to\nthat schedule if you don't want to.\n\n120\n00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,620\nYou can customize all of this.\n\n121\n00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,580\nAnd so that's what we're gonna take\na look at here in this episode.\n\n122\n00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,740\nThe first thing I wanna point out is just\nthe general Windows update screen, right?\n\n123\n00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,010\nSo let's pull up my laptop here.\n\n124\n00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,260\nAnd so I'm just here in my modern UI,\nand I'm gonna type in Windows update.\n\n125\n00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,420\nAnd it's not gonna find\nanything under applications,\n\n126\n00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,880\nbut under settings I'll see Windows\nupdate right there on the left side.\n\n127\n00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,771\nYou'll see a few other things\nlike checking for updates or\n\n128\n00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:16,510\nturning automatic updating on and\noff if you can change your mind.\n\n129\n00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,098\nI'm just gonna go into Windows update.\n\n130\n00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:24,356\nNow on mine,\nWindows updates are already turned on.\n\n131\n00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:27,638\nAnd so it tells me there's no updates\nright now, but I can check and\n\n132\n00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:31,270\nif I hit Check for\nupdates it's gonna reach out to Microsoft.\n\n133\n00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,690\nLet's see if there's anything new.\n\n134\n00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,810\nI don't know, maybe I.\n\n135\n00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,760\n>> I'm guessing there's three.\n\n136\n00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,160\nWhy, are there three in yours?\n\n137\n00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,814\nThere's three on mine.\n\n138\n00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,830\n>> [LAUGH] No, apparently I'm up to date.\n\n139\n00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,365\n>> I was going to say,\napparently I'm a slacker.\n\n140\n00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:43,890\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, you must have left your computer\n\n141\n00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,540\noff last night and\nI must have left mine on.\n\n142\n00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,580\nSo, you've got IVG running on yours?\n\n143\n00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,540\n>> I do, and I've got the old interface\nif you wanted to just compare.\n\n144\n00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,690\n>> Oh yeah, let's jump over.\n\n145\n00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,470\nCan you show them how you\ngot to that interface first?\n\n146\n00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,510\n>> Yeah, we can do that, sure.\n\n147\n00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,917\nAll right, so here's the desktop, and\nif we bring up our Control Panel.\n\n148\n00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200\nWe can go into System and Security again.\n\n149\n00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,890\nThis is the older interface.\n\n150\n00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,370\n>> How did you do, now see I know that\nWindows X, Windows Key X Shortcut.\n\n151\n00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,910\nHow did you get that menu up\nwithout doing Windows Key?\n\n152\n00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,000\n>> Oh yes, that's our right-click here.\n\n153\n00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,930\nYou can right-click on\nthe Start button if you will.\n\n154\n00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,360\n>> Wait a minute, that works?\n\n155\n00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,139\n>> Yeah.\n>> It really does, it really does.\n\n156\n00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,810\nFor those of you that use a mouse,\nit does work.\n\n157\n00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,640\nIf you come from, like Don comes back from\nthe days when they didn't even have mouse,\n\n158\n00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,100\nI don't even think mice were invented\nwhen you started in computing so\n\n159\n00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,040\neverything was textual based.\n\n160\n00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,730\nSo, we'll forgive you for that one.\n\n161\n00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,390\nSo what we're doing is we're going to the\ntraditional control panel and if you got\n\n162\n00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,970\nWindows 7 out there you're gonna see that\nthis is pretty much the same interface.\n\n163\n00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,840\nAnd I actually like the new interface.\n\n164\n00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,590\nSo we're gonna go to System and\nSecurity here.\n\n165\n00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,410\nAnd then you'll see Windows Update.\n\n166\n00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,330\nAnd you can see that the interface\nhas changed significantly.\n\n167\n00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,350\n>> Yeah, there's a lot more information\nwhen you go this way, right?\n\n168\n00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,915\nThe way I went that's all modern UI.\n\n169\n00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:56,504\nThey don't give you crap.\n\n170\n00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:58,422\nThey just give you a check for\nupdates button, and that's it.\n\n171\n00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:00,696\nAnd here, you get, well,\nyou get check for updates, but\n\n172\n00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:01,778\nyou get a lot more,\n>> And\n\n173\n00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:06,069\nyou do have some of this\nfunctionality in the,\n\n174\n00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:12,570\nlet's see if I can find Windows Update,\nthe new Windows update here.\n\n175\n00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,740\nI was actually looking at,\nwhere's the Windows Update?\n\n176\n00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,090\nOh, there it is.\n\n177\n00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,240\nOh, and it's going to bring up the.\n\n178\n00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,233\n>> Yeah, I think it was the top\nleft one of your icons.\n\n179\n00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:25,428\n>> Let's do a view and go to PC Settings\nand I've got this update here.\n\n180\n00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:28,503\nBut you can do the traditional\nview update history and\n\n181\n00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:32,560\nyou can see your details\nregarding what you've installed.\n\n182\n00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,780\nAnd here you can also choose\nhow they get installed and\n\n183\n00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,680\nyou can see the difference here.\n\n184\n00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,960\nThe interfaces pretty much show\nyou almost the same thing here.\n\n185\n00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,070\nBut, I do like the new tile interface.\n\n186\n00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,370\nVery slick.\n\n187\n00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,580\n>> Hm-mm, yep.\n\n188\n00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,430\nSo, for the most part, though,\nwhen you start to get into the really\n\n189\n00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,160\nadvanced things, the advanced settings or\nwhatever, a lot of times we'll jump into\n\n190\n00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,820\nthat classic interface just because it's\na little easier as far as what we need.\n\n191\n00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,580\nBut you can see right there, Wes is\nlooking at what updates are available.\n\n192\n00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,990\nThere's some critical ones, these\nare ones that fix problems on the system.\n\n193\n00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,320\nAnd then after that he's got some\noptional ones, which are drivers,\n\n194\n00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,290\nlooks like your USB network driver and\nyour, what is that, your video card?\n\n195\n00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:10,900\n>> Yeah.\nYeah,\n\n196\n00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,390\nI've gotta update our WDDM driver there.\n\n197\n00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,450\n>> Yep.\n\n198\n00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,800\nSo these are the types of\nthings that you'll see.\n\n199\n00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,740\nYou may have turned on Microsoft Update,\n\n200\n00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,410\nwhich means it will also update\nother Microsoft products.\n\n201\n00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,154\nThings like Microsoft Office,\nif you have them installed.\n\n202\n00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:24,729\n>> True.\n\n203\n00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,022\n>> I don't have Office on mine,\nso, so I don't have that.\n\n204\n00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:29,503\nBut you'll see updates for\nWindows Defender, right,\n\n205\n00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,800\nthe background antivirus and\nanti malware software that's running.\n\n206\n00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,910\nYou'll see updates for\nall sorts of stuff going on.\n\n207\n00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,310\n>> And that's one of the good\nthings about Windows Update.\n\n208\n00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,100\nWith all these different things\nthat they've started to bundle in,\n\n209\n00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,750\nyou used to have to go in one, Windows 7,\nyou have to go to, what was it,\n\n210\n00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,910\nthe Microsoft Security Essentials, and\nnow that functionality is built in.\n\n211\n00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,339\nWhat's really cool is your\ndefinitions now update,\n\n212\n00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,688\njust integrated into one console, your\ndefinitions update with Windows update.\n\n213\n00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:58,853\n>> Now, you are running?\n\n214\n00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:00,431\n>> 8.1\n>> You're running 8.1, okay.\n\n215\n00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:01,098\n>> 8.1.\n\n216\n00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:04,458\n>> So the screen you're on right\nnow doesn't exist in Windows 8 so,\n\n217\n00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,985\non the exam,\nyou're not gonna have this screen.\n\n218\n00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:10,981\nSo, on the exam, if they start diving into\nthings like viewing your update history\n\n219\n00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:14,021\nand all that you are going to have\nto use the classic interface.\n\n220\n00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:17,840\nSo that's what Wes was doing originally,\ngoing into the Control Panel, and\n\n221\n00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,848\ngoing into Windows Update right there.\n\n222\n00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,598\nAnd, so\nlet's walk through some of these, Wes.\n\n223\n00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:22,690\n>> Okay, sure.\n\n224\n00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,014\nWe can start here by doing the Check For\nUpdates and\n\n225\n00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:29,320\nI know that we've already done that, you\ncan see that there are updates available.\n\n226\n00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,700\nThose settings that we were talking about,\nyou can manage them here.\n\n227\n00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700\nAnd you have a few different options here.\n\n228\n00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,950\nWe can say install the update, so\nthis is gonna download them and\n\n229\n00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,600\ninstall them automatically for\nyou like it says there.\n\n230\n00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,800\nBut then we can say, well maybe I\njust want the security updates.\n\n231\n00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,410\nAnd that will let you download them and\nthen later you can select the specific\n\n232\n00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,180\ndrive that you want to install,\nso we do have options.\n\n233\n00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,300\nAnd then we can say never check,\n\n234\n00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,880\nand that's definitely not recommended,\nalthough looking at my\n\n235\n00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,640\nlaptop you might think that's what I\ndid too cause I've got updates [LAUGH].\n\n236\n00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,790\n>> Not that many though just five.\n\n237\n00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,740\n>> So on a laptop or\na desktop on your end user machines,\n\n238\n00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,760\nyou usually just want\nto set it to automatic.\n\n239\n00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,880\nJust have it automatically go out,\nget the updates and install them.\n\n240\n00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,160\nOne of the problems though is almost\nall of the updates require a reboot.\n\n241\n00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,990\nSo if you have a server,\nthat's not so ideal.\n\n242\n00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,440\nAnd that's where some of these other\noptions like download the updates but\n\n243\n00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,130\nlet me choose whether to install\nthem that becomes better.\n\n244\n00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,890\nThe server will go ahead and\ndownload them and they'll sit there.\n\n245\n00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,830\nThey won't install.\n\n246\n00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,870\nThey won't reboot your machine.\n\n247\n00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,030\nThey'll just sit there.\n\n248\n00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,910\nAnd then on your schedule,\nwhen you feel like it.\n\n249\n00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,170\nYou can go and approve the updates and\ntell it to install and reboot.\n\n250\n00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,480\nSo on a mission critical machine, and\nthat might be a Windows 8 machine.\n\n251\n00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,600\nIf it's mission critical, you might\nnot want to reboot it at night and so\n\n252\n00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880\nthat gives you that control.\n\n253\n00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,550\nThat's why we have these options,\nexcept for never check for updates,\n\n254\n00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,025\nthat's if you pirated the software.\n\n255\n00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,050\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I'd like to make mention, too,\n\n256\n00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,520\nif you see, Don mentioned\nMicrosoft Updates so not just Windows,\n\n257\n00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,520\nyou can see that that option's in\nthe traditional interface there as well.\n\n258\n00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,830\nFor Windows 8 this is\ngonna be the same thing.\n\n259\n00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,250\nYou're gonna have to go in here and-\n>> And you know,\n\n260\n00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,610\nif you jump over to my machine for\na second, Jason, and\n\n261\n00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,920\nyou'll notice when you jump over,\nsee how that option just disappeared?\n\n262\n00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,745\nSo I don't have\nMicrosoft Office installed.\n\n263\n00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:19,465\nI don't have any other Microsoft\nproducts that can be updated, so\n\n264\n00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:21,125\nthat option doesn't even show up.\n\n265\n00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:25,585\nBut if you install even one\nother Microsoft product,\n\n266\n00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:29,940\nlike Office or any of the other\nlike SharePoint Designer or\n\n267\n00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,770\nwhatever then you will\nsee that option appear.\n\n268\n00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,290\nSo it is detecting that for you.\n\n269\n00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,860\n>> That's really nice that it can say,\n\n270\n00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,260\noh you've got Microsoft products,\nlet's help you out.\n\n271\n00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,600\n>> Yeah, they love it when you\ncontinue to buy with Microsoft.\n\n272\n00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,520\nThat's the old joke I\nhad about on the exam,\n\n273\n00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,780\nif you ever hit a question on the exam and\nyou just don't know the answer.\n\n274\n00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,200\nYou have no clue.\n\n275\n00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,370\nBefore you just guess,\nI have two simple rules right.\n\n276\n00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,537\nRule number one, the answer that's\nthe longest is normally the right one.\n\n277\n00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:58,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So look at whichever answer has\n\n278\n00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,960\nthe most words,\nthat's normally the right one.\n\n279\n00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,610\nAnd then,\nif there's a couple that are close.\n\n280\n00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,640\nThe second one is,\n\n281\n00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,805\nwhichever answer requires you to\nspend more money with Microsoft.\n\n282\n00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So whichever one requires more\n\n283\n00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,670\nlicenses or more software,\nthat's usually the right one.\n\n284\n00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,860\nThose two have not failed me.\n\n285\n00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,110\nWe laugh about it now but take the exam,\n\n286\n00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,462\nyou guys will see,\nthose two rules are pretty accurate.\n\n287\n00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:21,500\n>> [LAUGH] Interesting.\n\n288\n00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,380\n>> All right, so\na couple other things in here.\n\n289\n00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,930\nOn mine it says like,\n\n290\n00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,610\nupdates will be automatically installed\nduring the maintenance window, and\n\n291\n00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,609\nthat is by default is like 3 AM, and\nif I click on it, I'll see 3 AM.\n\n292\n00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:37,620\nAnd we can go in here and\nchange that to whichever time we want.\n\n293\n00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,870\n3 AM is a good time for most people\nbecause they are asleep, right, but\n\n294\n00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,600\nwhat if you work the night shift.\n\n295\n00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,810\nAnd that's not so good.\n\n296\n00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,360\nYup.\n>> And\n\n297\n00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,080\nlike you're saying in the evening\nif you've got servers set up to\n\n298\n00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,560\nreboot that's probably not a good thing.\n\n299\n00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,110\nYou don't want to come back the next\nmorning and realize the update applied,\n\n300\n00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,995\ncaused a problem and now well,\nyour server's not on anymore.\n\n301\n00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:57,842\n>> Exactly.\n\n302\n00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:59,100\nAnd you'll see down here,\n\n303\n00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,280\nallow scheduled maintenance to wake\nup my computer at the scheduled time.\n\n304\n00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,660\nIf your computer's asleep its going\nto have a hard time updating.\n\n305\n00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,650\nYou can set this and it'll actually\nwake up at 3 am, do the updates, and\n\n306\n00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,850\nthen go back to sleep again.\n\n307\n00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,610\nSo not necessarily consuming power\nthe whole night by being left on.\n\n308\n00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,260\n>> Yeah, very good, and Jason, if you\nwill, we move back over to my screen here,\n\n309\n00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,390\nwe can show you an update history.\n\n310\n00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,270\nSo you can always,\nanother option, I clicked on it\n\n311\n00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,180\nwithout showing you guys where it is,\nthere is this view update history.\n\n312\n00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,280\nSo if I want to just have a database or\n\n313\n00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,650\na listing of any prior installed updates,\nI can find that here.\n\n314\n00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,930\nAnd that might be important in a situation\nwhere you're doing testing of,\n\n315\n00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,690\nmaybe this is just a test computer and\n\n316\n00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,890\nI want to verify that a single update\nmaybe didn't work as good as we like it.\n\n317\n00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,890\nWe can flag that one and\n\n318\n00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,760\nsay, okay next time we see that come up,\nwe're not going to update.\n\n319\n00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,060\n>> You know, Microsoft does extensive\ntesting of these updates, but\n\n320\n00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,590\nthey test it against their own software.\n\n321\n00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,820\nSo when you install a Windows update,\n\n322\n00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,330\nyou can pretty much guarantee that\nWindows is gonna be fine, and\n\n323\n00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,410\nOffice is gonna be fine, but maybe\nyou've got some third party software.\n\n324\n00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,280\nMaybe you've got QuickBooks,\nor point of sale software.\n\n325\n00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,090\nMaybe you've got your Steam client, right.\n\n326\n00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,470\nAnd Duke Nukem 3D or whatever.\n\n327\n00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,130\nAnd then it was playing\njust fine yesterday, and\n\n328\n00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,410\nall of a sudden today it's\nfreaking out and won't run.\n\n329\n00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,980\nAll right?\nWhat happened?\n\n330\n00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,080\nOne of the first things I do is\nI come right here, and I say,\n\n331\n00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,150\nokay, did I take an update last night?\n\n332\n00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,930\nAnd you can look at it.\n\n333\n00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,400\nWest you've got one right\nthere October 17th.\n\n334\n00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,170\nSo you did take an update this morning.\n\n335\n00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,420\nSo you can see it right there.\n\n336\n00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,230\nIt's just the Windows Defender definition\nupdate, it's not necessarily a big deal.\n\n337\n00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,370\nBut you can say, alright my\nsystem is freaking out right now.\n\n338\n00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,740\nLet's just uninstall this update and\nsee if that fixes the problem.\n\n339\n00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,250\nAnd do we see the Uninstall button here?\n\n340\n00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,030\n>> We don't, no, we do not.\n\n341\n00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,134\n>> We have to go to the other screen.\n\n342\n00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:54,245\nSo we can uninstall an update and the cool\npart is that once it's uninstalled,\n\n343\n00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,245\nthe next time you check for\nupdates it'll just show up again.\n\n344\n00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:58,515\nSo you can go an re-install it.\n\n345\n00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:00,135\nBut it gives you a chance to test and\n\n346\n00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:02,945\nverify that that's not\nwhat the problem was.\n\n347\n00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:03,476\n>> Yeah, and we also have the ability.\n\n348\n00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:05,417\nSo I've got a couple of\noptional updates and\n\n349\n00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,734\nthis one really is an important update\neven though it says it's optional.\n\n350\n00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,845\nThis is our WDDM driver for our graphics\nBut what I want to do is just go ahead and\n\n351\n00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:17,730\nright-click on this and I just want to\nshow you guys that I can hide this update.\n\n352\n00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,578\nAnd next time this runs, let's say\nthat we have done that research and\n\n353\n00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,764\nthis is an update that we don't want to\napply to a system because maybe it causes\n\n354\n00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,960\na problem on a certain\nmachine that we have.\n\n355\n00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,745\nWe can hide it so that we don't see it the\nnext time and we don't have to worry about\n\n356\n00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:33,180\nthat being in a list of updates\nwe've already checked and reviewed.\n\n357\n00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,740\nBut at the same time, we can always\nrestore the update if we want as well.\n\n358\n00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,863\nYou can see here I clicked the Restore\nhidden update button, right-click on it,\n\n359\n00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:43,744\noh, I think you just have to\nselect it here, there we go.\n\n360\n00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:46,613\n>> I think you just check it.\n\n361\n00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,070\n>> Then restore.\n\n362\n00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,550\n>> Yep, there you go.\n\n363\n00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,010\n>> And here we go, it makes its way back.\n\n364\n00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,150\n>> And somehow a third one appeared.\n\n365\n00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,300\nNice.\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n366\n00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,230\nI am using our producer's\n3.0 gigabyte adapter.\n\n367\n00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,580\n>> They're multiplying\n>> That's right\n\n368\n00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,750\n>> You know,\n\n369\n00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,275\none scenario where I use that\nhide updates a lot is when\n\n370\n00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,120\na new version of\nInternet Explorer comes out.\n\n371\n00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,600\nRight, at home I want the latest\nversion Internet Explorer.\n\n372\n00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,440\nSo when IE 11 comes out I want it.\n\n373\n00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,260\nBut at the office you may have\nweb-based applications that you use\n\n374\n00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,280\nthat don't support IE 11 yet.\n\n375\n00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,380\nSo you might need to stick with IE 10,\nor IE 9, or 8, or 7, right?\n\n376\n00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,940\nYou might need to stick with\none of those older versions.\n\n377\n00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,840\nWell, you don't want Windows Update\nperpetually threatening to\n\n378\n00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,500\nupdate to a new version of IE\nthat's gonna break your software.\n\n379\n00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,150\n>> Yep.\n>> And so\n\n380\n00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,697\nin that case you can hide IE 10 or\nhide whatever.\n\n381\n00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:38,260\nIE 11 cuz Windows 8 ships with IE 10.\n\n382\n00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,390\nBut you can hide that so that in\nthe future you'll do all your other\n\n383\n00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,430\nWindows Updates but it's not gonna replace\nInternet Explorer with a new version.\n\n384\n00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,900\n>> You know one that I hide is when\nyou get the higher end versions or\n\n385\n00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,210\neditions of Windows operating systems,\nthey always have those language packs, so\n\n386\n00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,600\nyou have like 43 language packs\n>> Yeah.\n\n387\n00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,030\n>> I really don't need a language pack for\nthe Russian, I don't speak Russian so\n\n388\n00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,070\nI hide that.\n\n389\n00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,266\n>> And there's a ton of them.\n\n390\n00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:06,325\nYou got Arabic, French,\na ton of them that are in there.\n\n391\n00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:07,790\n>> Yep.\n>> I always hide the ones,\n\n392\n00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,890\nanyone that includes the word Bing.\n\n393\n00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,520\nIf it does, the Bing desktop,\n\n394\n00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,398\nthe Bing toolbar, the Bing Binger or\nwhatever it is, just disable it.\n\n395\n00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:19,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And, I mean Bing technology.\n\n396\n00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,640\nYes, technology.\n\n397\n00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,500\n>> Technology.\n\n398\n00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,730\nSo, it's pretty cool they give us a lot of\ncontrol over this and for our home user,\n\n399\n00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,250\nthese are basically the settings,\nhave we missed any?\n\n400\n00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,472\n>> No I think we got them all there.\n\n401\n00:18:32,472 --> 00:18:33,450\n>> All right.\n\n402\n00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,800\nSo these settings are pretty cool, right?\n\n403\n00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,350\nAnd on an individual machine, we're going\nto do exactly what Wes just saw, and\n\n404\n00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,130\nactually Wes can you pull the trigger and\nstart your updates?\n\n405\n00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,670\n>> Yes we can do that.\n\n406\n00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,070\n>> You got network card updates in there,\nso that would disconnect your screen, but\n\n407\n00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,060\nmaybe just do those three?\n\n408\n00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,700\n>> Yeah.\nWe'll do the important ones here.\n\n409\n00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,440\n>> Or all of them.\n\n410\n00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,270\nThat's fine.\n\n411\n00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,960\n>> Did it do all of them?\n\n412\n00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,860\nDid it do the optionals?\n\n413\n00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,670\nI don't think it did.\n\n414\n00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,980\n>> Oh, okay.\nAll right.\n\n415\n00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,620\n>> We'll find out.\n\n416\n00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,065\nWe'll see you guys back in 15 minutes.\n\n417\n00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:02,350\n>> [LAUGH] So what it's doing now is\nit's downloading those updates and\n\n418\n00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,410\nthen it's going to install them and\nreally, Wes can minimize this window and\n\n419\n00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,140\nthen get to work, goof off, whatever.\n\n420\n00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,160\nWhen it's done, if it needs to reboot,\n\n421\n00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,710\nyou'll get a little pop-up that'll\nsay the system needs to restart.\n\n422\n00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,620\nWhen it says that, you can postpone it.\n\n423\n00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,639\nYou can put it off if you want,\nup to, is that four hours?\n\n424\n00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,150\nI think four hours is the maximum on it.\n\n425\n00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,360\n>> Yeah, and then it'll remind,\nit constantly keeps reminding you.\n\n426\n00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,910\n>> It harasses you until you reboot, cuz\nyou really need to reboot for the change.\n\n427\n00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,680\nYeah, so this one,\nit says it needs to reboot, and\n\n428\n00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,600\nit says it'll restart automatically\nin one day if you don't do it.\n\n429\n00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,040\nSo, you got one day to do the restart and\nthen it's going to start harassing you.\n\n430\n00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,980\nWhen it starts harassing you,\nyou can postpone it for\n\n431\n00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,100\nup to four hours at a time.\n\n432\n00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,510\nBut it's going to continue to harass you.\n\n433\n00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,690\n>> And we can do the restart during\nthe break and we come back and\n\n434\n00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,410\nsee what it does.\n\n435\n00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,750\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n436\n00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,030\nNow, all of those settings that you\njust saw are right there in the GUI.\n\n437\n00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,980\nPretty easy to manage.\n\n438\n00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,440\nBut, in a corporate environment, right?\n\n439\n00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,940\nIn an enterprise world, you don't want\nyour end users being responsible for\n\n440\n00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,712\nthe updates.\n\n441\n00:19:58,712 --> 00:19:59,340\nAll right?\n\n442\n00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,790\nSo there's a few things\nthat we may want to do.\n\n443\n00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,070\nFirst off,\nwe may want to define a group policy.\n\n444\n00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,510\nA group policy on our servers that can\nthen push out to all of our clients and\n\n445\n00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,740\nset the rules for\nwhen we want the updates to happen and\n\n446\n00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,620\nhow we want them to be handled.\n\n447\n00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,490\nThe cool part about doing that is you\nget consistent application across\n\n448\n00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,190\nyour environment and\nthe end user can't change it.\n\n449\n00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,010\nSo you don't have to worry about somebody\ndisabling the Windows updates or\n\n450\n00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,080\nnot doing them or whatever.\n\n451\n00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,940\nYou get that good coverage.\n\n452\n00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,080\nSo that's a pretty handy thing to do\nthrough the good old Windows Update.\n\n453\n00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,970\n>> And I believe this falls under some\nof the things that we've talked about\n\n454\n00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,220\nin some of our other shows,\nwhere we talked about patch management.\n\n455\n00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,952\nMaking sure that an administrator\ncan selectively approve or\n\n456\n00:20:38,952 --> 00:20:42,417\ndeny what patches get applied to a system\nto make sure that we just maintain that\n\n457\n00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,850\nlevel of stability and uptime.\n\n458\n00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,390\n>> Yep.\nAnd I wanna take a look at those policies.\n\n459\n00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,920\nBut before we do that,\nI do wanna mention one other thing.\n\n460\n00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,856\nRight?\nSo don't let me forget about\n\n461\n00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:54,461\npolicies [CROSSTALK].\n\n462\n00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,027\n>> Okay, okay.\n>> But, all of these Windows updates that\n\n463\n00:20:57,027 --> 00:21:01,590\nwe're talking about, it would be\ncrazy talk if it updated everything.\n\n464\n00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,650\nOne thing that it doesn't update,\nyour Windows Store apps.\n\n465\n00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,320\nThat anything that you purchase\nthrough the Windows Store is updated\n\n466\n00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,130\nvia the Windows Store.\n\n467\n00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,990\nAnd so any update that's there,\nyou gotta go and do separately, okay.\n\n468\n00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,150\nSo let's jump over to my computer cuz\nI know I haven't done my updates in\n\n469\n00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,030\nthe Windows Store in a while.\n\n470\n00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,440\nI've gotta have some.\n\n471\n00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,080\nThe Windows Store stuff is real easy.\n\n472\n00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,200\nAll right?\nWe go into our modern UI and then,\n\n473\n00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,830\nwe go into our store.\n\n474\n00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,110\nAnd actually, see how my Windows Store\nhas a number seven right there?\n\n475\n00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,820\nThat number seven lets me know\nthere's seven updates waiting for me.\n\n476\n00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,830\nNow, it doesn't say updates right there.\n\n477\n00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,410\nIt's just letting me know, but\nthere are seven updates, and\n\n478\n00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,670\nif I go into it, when I go into the\nWindows Store, I'll see the normal stuff.\n\n479\n00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,770\nHey, there's some apps waiting for\nme to buy them, and give them my money.\n\n480\n00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:50,200\nBut up here at the top, Updates 7,\nthat's how I know there's the updates.\n\n481\n00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,750\nAnd all I have to do is click on that,\nand it'll show me the updates and\n\n482\n00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,705\nI can update them one at a time or\nI can tell it to update the whole thing.\n\n483\n00:21:57,705 --> 00:21:59,145\nRight?\nThe default is they're all\n\n484\n00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:03,265\nall checked off, and you just need to hit\ninstall, and it's gonna do it, right?\n\n485\n00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,555\nSo, pretty convenient there.\n\n486\n00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:10,475\nThere's not really a lot of settings here,\nas far as configuring that, right?\n\n487\n00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:14,135\nSo, if I go into my Charms bar, and\nI go to Settings, let me do that again.\n\n488\n00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:16,605\nSo, I went into my Charms bar,\nand I hit Settings.\n\n489\n00:22:16,605 --> 00:22:17,935\nOh, I guess I was right there.\n\n490\n00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:21,710\nYou'll see, there's an App updates option,\nright here.\n\n491\n00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,050\nAnd when you go into App updates,\nhere's where you can say\n\n492\n00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,460\nautomatically download the app updates,\nand sync my licenses.\n\n493\n00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,100\nIf I bought the apps on another computer\nI might need to sync them down here.\n\n494\n00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,850\nSo you can set it to do that and\nit'll automatically do it.\n\n495\n00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,780\nMine is automatically checking for\nthe updates but it's not doing them.\n\n496\n00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,430\nSo, here's a bunch, and\nI can just hit Install and\n\n497\n00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,680\nnow it's going to start\ngoing through them.\n\n498\n00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,980\nAnd I've done something\nto my computer Wes.\n\n499\n00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,370\nI don't, oh, you know,\nI'm, I'm a big liar.\n\n500\n00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,800\nI was about to say mine is so\n\n501\n00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,640\nincredibly slow doing the updates but\nit just screamed right through it there.\n\n502\n00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,090\n>> I was going to say boy,\nyou're impatient.\n\n503\n00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,820\nI mean,\nthat happened in like three seconds.\n\n504\n00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,610\n>> Now, I swear to you,\nI'm not making this up.\n\n505\n00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,280\nJust a couple of days ago it took\nover half an hour to do some updates.\n\n506\n00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,770\n>> Ludicrous speed, go!\n\n507\n00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,218\n>> So what you just saw is\nwhat it's supposed to be like.\n\n508\n00:23:10,218 --> 00:23:12,256\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't think it was going to do that.\n\n509\n00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:15,630\nBut it's supposed to be pretty\nquick cuz the apps aren't very big.\n\n510\n00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,355\n>> Yeah.\n>> Some of them might get to 200\n\n511\n00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,250\nmegs or so.\n\n512\n00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,830\nSo as long as they've downloaded and\nare ready to go,\n\n513\n00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,140\nthey should install pretty quickly.\n\n514\n00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,979\nBut now I'm all up to date and I know that\nbecause I don't see the little update\n\n515\n00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:28,650\nmessage in the top right\ncorner of my screen anymore.\n\n516\n00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,880\nSo that's gone.\n\n517\n00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,890\nAnd if I go back to my modern UI,\nif I get out of the store, there we go.\n\n518\n00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,710\nThings like the Kindle app updated and\nthe Netflix app updated.\n\n519\n00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,970\nAnd so they're just ready to rock.\n\n520\n00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,490\nI didn't really pay attention\nto what other apps updated.\n\n521\n00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,280\nBut if I go into the Kindle app, then\nI can launch in there and off it goes.\n\n522\n00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,750\nApparently I've never even signed in.\n\n523\n00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,200\nSo it's up to date, I don't have to\ndo anything else special with it,\n\n524\n00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,330\nit's just done.\n\n525\n00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,300\nAnd that's the end of it.\n\n526\n00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,330\nSo very, very convenient.\n\n527\n00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:03,686\n>> Very cool.\n>> All right, so the thing that I said.\n\n528\n00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:05,811\nActually, before I jump onto that,\ndo you got anything to add onto that?\n\n529\n00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,807\n>> No, I think we're good.\n\n530\n00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:08,468\n>> Okay.\n\n531\n00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:11,942\nI want to talk about the policies, and\n\n532\n00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:16,836\nI want to talk about\nWindows Server Update Services.\n\n533\n00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:17,822\n>> Yes.\n>> Windows, yeah.\n\n534\n00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:18,414\n>> Yeah, you got it.\n\n535\n00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:20,510\n>> So I want to talk about those guys.\n\n536\n00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,650\nWe do only have a couple of minutes\nleft in this segment, though,\n\n537\n00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,290\nso Why don't we do this, Wes?\n\n538\n00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,090\nWhy don't we stop and take a break.\n\n539\n00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:26,630\n>> Yep, we can do that.\n\n540\n00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,940\n>> During the break,\nyou can reboot for your updates or\n\n541\n00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,730\nwhatever-\n>> I can do that.\n\n542\n00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,840\nYes, I can.\n>> That will make you happy.\n\n543\n00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240\nAnd then when we get back, we can\ntake a look at those other policies.\n\n544\n00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,090\nDp you have anything\nelse to fill in before?\n\n545\n00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,540\n>> Other than we've got blue shirts on,\nand we're good.\n\n546\n00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,110\n>> We do have blue shirts.\n\n547\n00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,780\n>> We covered that at\nthe beginning of the show.\n\n548\n00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,140\n>> So the viewers at home,\nif you haven't already,\n\n549\n00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,370\nyou gotta change into your blue shirts.\n\n550\n00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,440\nIt is blue shirt day.\n\n551\n00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,370\nAnd if there's one thing we've\nestablished in like all of our A+ shows,\n\n552\n00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,090\nanything that's blue is obviously\nfaster than any other color.\n\n553\n00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:49,970\n>> It's got to work better.\n\n554\n00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,686\nThat's how I selected my memory for\nmy computer.\n\n555\n00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:52,503\n>> [LAUGH] There we go.\n\n556\n00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:54,300\nAll right, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n557\n00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,470\nWhen we get back, more action packed\nadventure filled Windows updates, and\n\n558\n00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,662\neventually we'll get into some file and\ndisk stuff and have a good time there too.\n\n559\n00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:03,241\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n560\n00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:05,035\nwe'll see you back after these messages.\n\n561\n00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:05,878\n>> See you soon!\n\n562\n00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:13,240\n[MUSIC]\n\n563\n00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,560\n>> All right,\nwelcome back to IT Pro TV everybody.\n\n564\n00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,987\nThese are the times I appreciate the mic\nbeing turned off during the break.\n\n565\n00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:24,118\n[LAUGH] So anyhow,\nwe left off talking about Windows update.\n\n566\n00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:28,333\nAnd Wes had a good idea during the break,\njust shocking out of the blue.\n\n567\n00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,764\n>> I know it doesn't happen much.\n>> Out of the blue, see, blue shirts.\n\n568\n00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:33,771\nReally bring this whole, full circle.\n\n569\n00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:36,664\n>> We just lost two more viewers.\n\n570\n00:25:36,664 --> 00:25:37,767\n>> And a couple of brain cells.\n\n571\n00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:39,745\nSo he had a great idea which was,\n\n572\n00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:44,675\nlet's show you guys how we manage these\nsayings in an enterprise environment.\n\n573\n00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:47,807\nFor a home user, yeah, you just go\ninto your Window's update settings and\n\n574\n00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,991\nyou change them, but in the enterprise\nenvironment where you're managing\n\n575\n00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:54,222\nthousands or tens of thousands of\nmachines, it's not realistic to do that,\n\n576\n00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:55,940\nand your end users will dink with stuff.\n\n577\n00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,550\nThat'll cause all sorts of problems.\n\n578\n00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,940\nSo, we have these policy settings\nwe can create that'll enforce this.\n\n579\n00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,160\nLet's start with you, Wes, on the client\nand show the normal environment.\n\n580\n00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,660\n>> Yes.\n>> And then we'll lock it down.\n\n581\n00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,560\n>> So if we could switch over\nto my desk top real quick,\n\n582\n00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,430\nwe're just in the traditional Windows,\nI say traditional,\n\n583\n00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,070\nI guess there's nothing\ntraditional about it.\n\n584\n00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,660\n>> It's a tradition!\n\n585\n00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,720\n>> It's a tradition, we're in\nthe Windows Metro UI right here, and\n\n586\n00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,010\nwe're gonna go to our charms bar, and.\n\n587\n00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,600\n>> Charming.\n\n588\n00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:29,680\n>> Charming and then from our charms\nbar we are going to go to settings.\n\n589\n00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,620\n>> Oh your IVGA died.\n\n590\n00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,540\n>> Oh no.\n>> You didn't pay your IVGA bill.\n\n591\n00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,910\n>> Oh no.\n\n592\n00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,500\n>> Well let me get him logged back in but.\n\n593\n00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,210\nWhile he's doing that, what he's wanting\nto show is basically the screens that we\n\n594\n00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:45,220\nhad before, where the default settings\nin Windows are that you have check for\n\n595\n00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,330\nupdates every day at 3 AM,\nautomatically install the updates,\n\n596\n00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,700\nwe don't have to mess with it, right?\n\n597\n00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,080\nAnd And for a home user,\nif they just leave it be,\n\n598\n00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,150\nthat's gonna be great, and\nthings are gonna work swell.\n\n599\n00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,400\n>> All right, now you guys can\nsee what's going on out there.\n\n600\n00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,450\nThere we go, so we're on out metro UI,\n\n601\n00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,850\nwe're going to the charms button here,\nMenu if you will.\n\n602\n00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,540\nPC Settings.\n\n603\n00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,850\nAnd we're gonna go to Update and Recovery.\n\n604\n00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,820\nAnd here's that Windows Update\nscreen that we see.\n\n605\n00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,555\nAnd apparently I'm gonna restart now.\n\n606\n00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:17,430\n>> No you just do the,\n\n607\n00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,960\ngo to choose how updates get installed-\n>> There we go.\n\n608\n00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,120\n>> And there's are settings, right?\n\n609\n00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,930\n>> All right.\nAnd I could manipulate these settings.\n\n610\n00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,980\nI could say you know what?\n\n611\n00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,930\nI don't want to check for\nupdates ever, you know,\n\n612\n00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,100\nbecause that's what we should do.\n\n613\n00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,040\n>> Typical end user, right?\n\n614\n00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040\nWhat do I care about updates?\n\n615\n00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,360\n>> And we are going to go ahead and apply.\n\n616\n00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,310\n>> And it's perfectly happy with that.\n\n617\n00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,380\n>> And now it's happy.\n\n618\n00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,970\n>> So Windows will let the end user\ndo whatever the heck they want\n\n619\n00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,790\nif they're an administrator on\nthe machine and by default.\n\n620\n00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,670\nBut in a corporate environment\nwe'll often wanna reign that in,\n\n621\n00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:49,700\nreel that in, whatever the saying is and\nput some control on it, right?\n\n622\n00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,070\nSo, what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna\ncreate a policy on my side that says,\n\n623\n00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,670\nno, don't allow end users to do that.\n\n624\n00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,770\nWe're gonna hard set it.\n\n625\n00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,790\nSo that we can force it in place,\nall right?\n\n626\n00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,550\nSo let me show you guys how we do that.\n\n627\n00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,510\nJump over to my machine.\n\n628\n00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,670\nAnd I'm remoted into what's\ncalled a domain controller.\n\n629\n00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,690\nAnd we'll cover all this in\nthe Windows Server shows.\n\n630\n00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,650\nDid mine drop out too?\n\n631\n00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,000\nI'm getting the evil\nlook from our director.\n\n632\n00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,510\nHang on, let me restart my desktop.\n\n633\n00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,640\nBut anyhow, in a corporate environment,\nyou use a domain controller, a centralized\n\n634\n00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,980\nlocation where you have your user accounts\nand passwords, and all that good stuff.\n\n635\n00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,780\nAll kind of stuck in in one place\nwhere it's easy to manage, and\n\n636\n00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,650\nthat easy to manage part is\nkind of the important thing.\n\n637\n00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,780\nBecause if you're dealing with hundreds\nof machines, you don't want to have to\n\n638\n00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:43,120\nsort through, manually configuring\nall these different machines.\n\n639\n00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,700\nSo we have to be careful of that,\nthere we go.\n\n640\n00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,140\nSo basically I'm on my server, and\n\n641\n00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:51,350\nI'm in what's called called the group\npolicy management consul, or the GPMC.\n\n642\n00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,555\nAnd on the GPMC, you can go through and\ndefine policies for all sorts of things.\n\n643\n00:28:55,555 --> 00:28:59,440\nWes's computer is in this folder\nright here called lab computers.\n\n644\n00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,090\nAnd so I'm just going to\ncreate a policy on there.\n\n645\n00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,570\nSo I'll create a GPO and\nI'll call it Windows Update Settings.\n\n646\n00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,400\nAll right, and\nthen I'm going to edit that.\n\n647\n00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,470\nAnd what I'm going to do is if you've\nnever seen a group policy object before,\n\n648\n00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,440\nwell, you didn't watch\nthe beginning of the episode.\n\n649\n00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,820\nSecondly, then it's really neat.\n\n650\n00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,070\nIt's really just a representation\nof the registry of a computer.\n\n651\n00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,690\nSo all the settings of the registry and\n\n652\n00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:32,040\nthere's millions of them,\nthe important ones are represented here.\n\n653\n00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,010\nThe important ones, meaning there's\nprobably about 3,000 or 4,000.\n\n654\n00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean there's still a lot in here, but\n\n655\n00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,870\nwe can go in and\nwe can configure all sorts of stuff.\n\n656\n00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:46,650\nAnd when we go in here, and I'll dig\nunder policies, administrative templates.\n\n657\n00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:52,430\nWindows components, and down in here\nsomewhere, we've got Windows updates.\n\n658\n00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,880\nThere it goes, Windows updates.\n\n659\n00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,690\nI've got various settings that I can\ndefine in here that configure and\n\n660\n00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,450\ncontrol Window's updates.\n\n661\n00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,530\nSo, if I go in here I can find, let's see.\n\n662\n00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,080\nAlways automatically restart,\nno, we don't wanna to do that.\n\n663\n00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,340\nHere.\nConfigure automatic updates.\n\n664\n00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,980\nRight?\n\n665\n00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,640\nSo I can pull this up, and\n\n666\n00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,160\nI can enable the setting where I\nmanually control how people update.\n\n667\n00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,380\nAnd down here I get these options.\n\n668\n00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,250\nSo I'm gonna set it so that for\n\n669\n00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:26,170\nthese machines they will auto download and\nschedule the install.\n\n670\n00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,590\nI want it to do the whole thing.\n\n671\n00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,710\nI don't want the end\nuser to have any control.\n\n672\n00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,981\nI want it to automatically download,\n\n673\n00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:35,730\nautomatically install, reboot as\nnecessary, I'm gonna set it to do that.\n\n674\n00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,050\nAnd I'm gonna say schedule\nthe install everyday,\n\n675\n00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:46,200\nat maybe 3 AM is not the best for\nme right, so maybe I'll pick 2 AM.\n\n676\n00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,580\nSo I'm gonna do everyday at 2 AM.\n\n677\n00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,120\nWe could say install during automatic\nmaintenance but I'll leave that be.\n\n678\n00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,970\nSo I want it to install everyday at 2 AM.\n\n679\n00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,550\nNow Wes overrode this.\n\n680\n00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,980\nHe set his to never check for updates.\n\n681\n00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,720\nRight?\n\n682\n00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,100\nBut this policy countermands that and\nthis policy will trump it and take effect.\n\n683\n00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,470\nSo I'm gonna just kinda set that and\n\n684\n00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:13,080\nyou'll see there's other things in here,\nhow often it checks for new updates.\n\n685\n00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,200\nYou can come in and define that.\n\n686\n00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,310\nI might want it to check for\nupdates every 22 hours of the default.\n\n687\n00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,720\nI might want to lower that to every\nsix hours or something to that nature.\n\n688\n00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,950\nI'll leave it that way.\n\n689\n00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,250\n>> That one down there at the bottom too,\nyou know enforcing digital signatures\n\n690\n00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,080\non your updates from an internal\ninternet and stuff, too.\n\n691\n00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,600\n>> Yeah, I'll talk about that one in\na minute, the internal updates servers\n\n692\n00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,190\nare really cool but let's just stick\nto the basic settings for now.\n\n693\n00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,930\n>> Sure, sure\n>> Those two right there are pretty much\n\n694\n00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,600\nthe basic ones.\n\n695\n00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,430\nIf you are completely controlling updates,\n\n696\n00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,130\nyou may not even want\nthe users to know about it.\n\n697\n00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,300\nSo you can turn off\nthe software notifications.\n\n698\n00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,090\nThen the end users dont' even see it.\n\n699\n00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,820\nIt just updates,\nreboots in the background and it's done.\n\n700\n00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,510\nAll right.\n\n701\n00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,980\nNow, this policy is set.\n\n702\n00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,537\nIt's in place and\nit doesn't take effect right away.\n\n703\n00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:09,020\nClients will check in every hour and\na half, every 90 minutes by default.\n\n704\n00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,465\nSo, in the next 90 minutes Wes's\ncomputer's gonna check in and\n\n705\n00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:13,396\nsee this policy.\n\n706\n00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:16,346\nThe problem is the show doesnt\nhave 90 minutes left in it, so\n\n707\n00:32:16,346 --> 00:32:18,120\nwe're going to force things along.\n\n708\n00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,650\nLet's jump back over to Wes's machine.\n\n709\n00:32:20,832 --> 00:32:25,300\nHe's gonna force his machine to do\nan update, not a Windows update, but\n\n710\n00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,710\na policy update.\n\n711\n00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,370\nIt's gonna look to the server and\ndo a refresh.\n\n712\n00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,658\nOh, did Wes drop out again?\n\n713\n00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,962\n>> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n714\n00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:34,510\n>> Okay.\n\n715\n00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,920\nYou wanna restart your IVGA.\n\n716\n00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,440\nIt dropped out.\n\n717\n00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,360\nI may be stealing the same\nIVGA number as you.\n\n718\n00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,970\n>> All right.\n>> Actually here, let me rephrase that.\n\n719\n00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,240\nYou're obviously stealing\nthe same IVGA number as me.\n\n720\n00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,660\n>> Well that's what I was saying.\n\n721\n00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,250\nWhich one are you on?\n\n722\n00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,090\n>> I'm on two.\n\n723\n00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,030\n>> Two.\nAll right.\n\n724\n00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,190\nOne send.\n\n725\n00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,140\nThere we go, there.\n\n726\n00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,610\nThere's a directory, sorry about that.\n\n727\n00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,760\n>> So Wes is just gonna speed\nup the process a little bit, and\n\n728\n00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,020\nmake it get that policy\nright away using Gpupdate.\n\n729\n00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,085\n>> Gpupdate.\nAll right.\n\n730\n00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:04,610\n>> Or not.\n\n731\n00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,236\n>> Or gpupdate.\n\n732\n00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:05,980\n>> Gpudate.\n\n733\n00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,863\n>> Gpudate!\nAll right, so\n\n734\n00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:09,205\nI'm challenging my abilities to type and.\n\n735\n00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,980\n>> The all new technical dating service.\n\n736\n00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,910\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n737\n00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:15,542\nThere we go.\n\n738\n00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,015\nHelps when you spell those right,\ndoesn't it?\n\n739\n00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:17,747\n>> Yeah.\n\n740\n00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:18,629\n>> Syntax is important.\n\n741\n00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:19,813\n>> No spell check in the command line.\n\n742\n00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:22,948\n>> Oh darn.\n\n743\n00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:27,208\n>> All right so once that's done,\nthere it goes and once its done.\n\n744\n00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:29,727\nWhy don't you recreate being\nthe annoying end-user Wes\n\n745\n00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:30,910\n>> Oh okay.\n\n746\n00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,712\n>> You're so good at it.\n\n747\n00:33:31,712 --> 00:33:34,011\n>> I was going to say\nyou're in my ballpark here.\n\n748\n00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,490\nNow we're gonna open the interface here.\n\n749\n00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,768\nWindows update.\n\n750\n00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,290\nNo, it's going to tell me to restart.\n\n751\n00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,140\nApparently I've already applied updates.\n\n752\n00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,257\n>> Go to change settings.\n\n753\n00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,390\nOh.\n>> So earlier, he came in here and\n\n754\n00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,270\nhe said, never check for updates.\n\n755\n00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,327\n>> Why you gotta be like that, man?\n\n756\n00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, obviously,\n\n757\n00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,290\nyou made some bad decisions so\nI just stepped in.\n\n758\n00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,220\nIntervention.\n\n759\n00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,760\n>> Oka.\n>> But yeah, if you look at it now, and\n\n760\n00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,960\nI can barely read it,\n>> Right at the top,\n\n761\n00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,490\nit says some settings are managed\nby your systems administrator, and\n\n762\n00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,730\nthe options have been removed,\nso the end user can't change it.\n\n763\n00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,580\nSee how, where it's got important updates,\ninstall updates automatically, and\n\n764\n00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,510\nit's grayed out?\n\n765\n00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,170\nWes can no longer change that.\n\n766\n00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,800\nHe could drop that down a minute ago.\n\n767\n00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,500\nAnd also, the schedule stuff\n\n768\n00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,110\nhas kinda been taken away from you, so-\n>> I've seen that in the new\n\n769\n00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,960\ninterface, too.\n\n770\n00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,390\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> I was showing the old interface, here.\n\n771\n00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,259\n>> Yeah, go to the old modern UI.\n\n772\n00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:34,770\nYeah, then there it is.\n\n773\n00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,540\nIt's great out there, also.\n\n774\n00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,260\nSo that's the cool part about a policy,\n\n775\n00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,970\nis I can set it in one place and it will\napply across a thousand machines and\n\n776\n00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,050\nenforce that setting and make it\nwhere the end user can't change it.\n\n777\n00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,680\nAll right now Wes you did the lead in\n\n778\n00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,300\nthere a second ago on a Windows update\nserver or an intranet update, right?\n\n779\n00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,330\nif you've got tons of computers,\n\n780\n00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,120\nlet me show you guys a picture\nan Jason am I still connected?\n\n781\n00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,640\nOkay.\n\n782\n00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,670\nSo let me show you guys a picture.\n\n783\n00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,310\nLet's say that I'm a company and I've got\nfour computers, PC1, two, three, and four.\n\n784\n00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,300\nWith the default Windows update settings,\nthose PCs are going\n\n785\n00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,010\nto jump through their switch, through\nthe router, all the way out to Microsoft.\n\n786\n00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,700\nTo get their updates, okay.\n\n787\n00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,910\nThe problem here is, every PC is\ngonna do it, now for a home user,\n\n788\n00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,740\nwe don't care, right?\n\n789\n00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,290\nIf two or three machines are going out,\nthat's fine, right?\n\n790\n00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,530\nBut, what if we have a thousand machines,\n\n791\n00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,950\nwell all one thousand of them\nare going out to Microsoft and\n\n792\n00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,390\ndownloading the exact same updates,\nit's not very efficient, okay?\n\n793\n00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,560\nSo if you had a thousand machines\ndownloading the same file,\n\n794\n00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,630\nthe same file gets downloaded a thousand\ntimes, you're wasting a ton of bandwidth.\n\n795\n00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,490\nAll right.\n\n796\n00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,580\nAlso, what if I wanna hide an update?\n\n797\n00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,530\nRemember, in the last segment,\n\n798\n00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,340\nI mentioned that I might hide Internet\nExplorer 11 cuz I'm not ready for it yet.\n\n799\n00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,900\nRight?\n\n800\n00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,300\nWell, I don't want to have to go\nto all 1000 of my machines and\n\n801\n00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,470\ntell them to hide that update.\n\n802\n00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:09,340\nSo what we can do, is we can introduce\nwhat's called a WSUS server.\n\n803\n00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,250\nAnd that stands for\nWindows Server Update Services and\n\n804\n00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,680\nit is a part of Windows Server 2012.\n\n805\n00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,460\nIt's actually a part of\nWindows Server 2008.\n\n806\n00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,510\nFor Windows Server 2003, you can go and\ndownload it for free from Microsoft but\n\n807\n00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:31,800\nbasically an add on for Windows,\nand it lets you build an internal\n\n808\n00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,040\nWindows update server, called a WSUS.\n\n809\n00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,850\nIt used to be called WUS,\nWindows update services.\n\n810\n00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,980\nThis is, but\ntoo many people call it a wuss server.\n\n811\n00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,820\nMicrosoft finally stuck another\nS in there just to make it.\n\n812\n00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,240\n>> Yeah, we don't have any wuss servers.\n\n813\n00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,730\n>> And that's a true story, actually.\n\n814\n00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,235\nThat's not a made-up, Don, B.S.\nstory like sometimes.\n\n815\n00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:51,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This one's a real story.\n\n816\n00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,830\nOh, shoot, that's red.\n\n817\n00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,810\nBut now, I've got a red network cable.\n\n818\n00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,740\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n819\n00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,850\nBut-\n>> Oh, my goodness.\n\n820\n00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,950\nIs it blue?\n\n821\n00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:02,350\n>> But, when we have a WSUS server,\nthe way it works now,\n\n822\n00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:06,785\nis the WSUS server, is the one\nthat reaches out to the Internet.\n\n823\n00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:10,565\nYou'd think I'd never used\nthis drawing tool before.\n\n824\n00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:14,015\nIt reaches out to the Internet and\nit gets the updates.\n\n825\n00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:17,727\nAnd then, all of the clients,\ninstead of going out to the Internet,\n\n826\n00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:21,047\nthey just go right up to WSUS.\n\n827\n00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:24,117\nThey go right to this internal server and\n\n828\n00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,937\nthey download the information,\nthe updates right from there.\n\n829\n00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:30,290\nSo we only go out to the internet once.\n\n830\n00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,000\nAnd everything else just happens\nright off of our own local server.\n\n831\n00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,960\nIt cuts down on the bandwidth, and,\n\n832\n00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,130\nif I hide an update there in the WSUS\nserver, then the clients never see it.\n\n833\n00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,340\nThey never notice that.\n\n834\n00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,300\n>> So the benefit is really just, you\nknow, so you're not chewing through it,\n\n835\n00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,730\nyour entire bandwidth in\na corporate type] environment, and\n\n836\n00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,250\nhaving really that\ncentralized patch management.\n\n837\n00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,240\n>> Yeah.\n>> So your administrator can do this, and\n\n838\n00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,869\nwe don't have to bother the user.\n\n839\n00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:54,714\nI was gonna use that term,\n\n840\n00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:55,401\nJiminy Click-its\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n841\n00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:58,665\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which again, for a home user,\n\n842\n00:37:58,665 --> 00:38:00,770\nwe're not gonna care about this, right?\n\n843\n00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,350\nBut for a corporate environment, and an\nenterprise environment, this is important.\n\n844\n00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,310\nSo with that in mind,\n\n845\n00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:15,500\nsetting up a WSUS that's kinda\noutside the scope of the 70-687 exam.\n\n846\n00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,120\nWe do talk about that though in the server\n2012 shows, so if you tune into those\n\n847\n00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,335\nshows, you will tackle it there,\nbut it's enforced with a policy,\n\n848\n00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:29,775\na policy in that same place that I was in\na moment ago, if i go back to that server.\n\n849\n00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,063\nWhere did I leave that?\n\n850\n00:38:31,063 --> 00:38:34,368\n>> And while Don is doing that keep in\nmind that when we talk about managing\n\n851\n00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:38,235\na Windows 8 machine don't just think just\nfrom the home environment a lot of these\n\n852\n00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:39,189\ncertifications and\n\n853\n00:38:39,189 --> 00:38:42,800\nmost of the certifications are geared\ntowards the corporate environment.\n\n854\n00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,221\nSo this is a very real world\napplication that you could see and\n\n855\n00:38:46,221 --> 00:38:49,522\nmost likely will see in\nan enterprise level environment.\n\n856\n00:38:49,522 --> 00:38:53,743\n>> So we have this policy option right\nhere amongst the other ones that says,\n\n857\n00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:57,270\nspecify Intranet Microsoft\nUpdate Service Location.\n\n858\n00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:02,505\nSo that says I've got a WSUS server\ninside of my environment and\n\n859\n00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:04,435\nso we can come in here and hard set that.\n\n860\n00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:10,345\nI can enable it, and\nI can point to the server so\n\n861\n00:39:10,345 --> 00:39:11,875\nyou actually have a couple servers.\n\n862\n00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:12,885\nYou specify the name.\n\n863\n00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:17,030\nI'll say ITProTV-DC1 as the server.\n\n864\n00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,875\nAnd for the statistics,\nI'll just point it to the same server.\n\n865\n00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:22,650\nAll right.\n\n866\n00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,353\nSo I can punch in that server\ninformation there, and I can apply it.\n\n867\n00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,231\nAnd now, the next time Wes's machine\nupdates, now, not only will it,\n\n868\n00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:37,056\nBe forced to do updates at my interval,\ninstead of going out to Microsoft,\n\n869\n00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,140\nit'll go to my server instead.\n\n870\n00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,800\nMy local server that I control,\nthat I can manage the updates on, and\n\n871\n00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,460\nreally does make things easier for me.\n\n872\n00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,595\nIf you are managing a large network,\nyou really need stuff like this.\n\n873\n00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:49,095\n>> Sure.\n\n874\n00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:56,690\n>> All right,\nam I leaving anything out Wes?\n\n875\n00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,096\n>> No, with the updates,\nI think we've really just about covered.\n\n876\n00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:02,753\n>> I'm a pull up the objectives\nhere just to make sure.\n\n877\n00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:07,687\nSo we got, configure the update settings,\nconfigure Windows update policies,\n\n878\n00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:10,619\nmanage the update history,\nrollback updates,\n\n879\n00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,424\nwhich is just uninstalling the updates,\nHey, I do wanna show that real quick.\n\n880\n00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:17,548\nAnd I know we kinda went into it earlier.\n\n881\n00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,470\nIf you ever need to roll back an update.\n\n882\n00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,850\nWe, well actually we did show it,\ndidn't we?\n\n883\n00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,900\n>> Mmhm.\n>> You just go into the uninstall programs\n\n884\n00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,510\nand you can pull it from right in there.\n\n885\n00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,960\nIf we go to uninstall program,\nthey don't show up by default,\n\n886\n00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,500\nyou have to choose this\nView installed updates.\n\n887\n00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,980\nAnd you see them right there and\nyou can choose and uninstall any of them.\n\n888\n00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,760\nThey will come back again, though,\n\n889\n00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,660\nunless you go and\nhide them inside of Windows Update.\n\n890\n00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,340\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n891\n00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,940\nBut easy enough to roll them back and\nget them out of there.\n\n892\n00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,560\n>> Yep.\n>> You can do this from safe mode too, so\n\n893\n00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,010\nif things really get borked,\nyou know you can go in to that.\n\n894\n00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,750\n>> Yeah and one thing to keep\nin mind too is that when you do\n\n895\n00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,490\napply an update whether it be locally,\nvia a home environment or\n\n896\n00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:00,690\nlike Don has been explaining here\nin an enterprise level environment\n\n897\n00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,560\none of the things you wanna\njust keep in mind is that.\n\n898\n00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,190\nBefore the Windows operating system does\nthat update, it creates a restore point,\n\n899\n00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,100\nit creates a checkpoint.\n\n900\n00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:12,250\nSo that if we, let's say we do have to\nroll back one of those drivers and for\n\n901\n00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,220\nsome reason,\nthe rollback doesn't do anything,\n\n902\n00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,150\nwe can hopefully point it\nback to an earlier point.\n\n903\n00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,686\n>> Yeah, or, if you can't even get\ninto safe mode [LAUGH] if you're just\n\n904\n00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:19,440\ncompletely hosed.\n\n905\n00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,950\n>> Yeah.\n\n906\n00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,532\nSo, Windows does protect itself,\neven before it applies an update.\n\n907\n00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:27,150\nIt will create that checkpoint and\nthen if you can't roll back the drive or\n\n908\n00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,330\nif it boots into Safe Mode, you do have\nthe ability to restore your system state\n\n909\n00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,405\ndata to an earlier point in time.\n\n910\n00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:33,920\n>> Yeah.\n\n911\n00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,290\nAlright, well its a little bit early on\nthe schedule well why don't we do this.\n\n912\n00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,430\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break.\n\n913\n00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:38,987\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n914\n00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:40,810\nwhen we get back we're gonna switch gears.\n\n915\n00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,560\nWe're done talking about Windows\nupdates now we're going to jump into\n\n916\n00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,460\nmanaging local storage.\n\n917\n00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,230\nSo stay tuned for\nsome super awesome storage action and\n\n918\n00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,950\nwe'll be back in a few minutes.\n\n919\n00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,601\n>> See you then.\n\n920\n00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:55,721\n[MUSIC]\n\n921\n00:41:55,721 --> 00:42:02,199\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n922\n00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:07,559\nWhat we want to talk about now is a topic\nthat, if you've watched our A Plus shows,\n\n923\n00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:13,300\nthen we've already tackled as far as disk\nmanagement and partitions and things.\n\n924\n00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,980\nBut it is on the Windows 8 exam,\non the 70-687 exam, so\n\n925\n00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,830\nwe do need to make sure we've\ngot a firm understanding, so\n\n926\n00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:24,260\nwe're gonna revisit it and tackle managing\nour hard discs and local storage.\n\n927\n00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,950\nNow local storage has changed recently,\nit's been hard drives for years and years,\n\n928\n00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,930\nand now we start to see a lot of solid\nstate disks, or SSD's- Fortunately,\n\n929\n00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,690\nfrom the Windows side,\nwe really manage them the same way.\n\n930\n00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,360\nThey kind of show up the same.\n\n931\n00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,300\nBut our number one go-to tool for\n\n932\n00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,330\nmanaging our disks is simply going\nto be computer management screen.\n\n933\n00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,090\nOn the computer management screen,\nyou've got the disk manager and\n\n934\n00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,000\nthat's where we get to work.\n\n935\n00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,400\nSo that's where I'm going to start off, so\n\n936\n00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,018\nlet's jump over to my desktop here and\nwe're gonna see this in action.\n\n937\n00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:58,430\nSo I'm gonna use my handy dandy\nwindows key x shortcut and\n\n938\n00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,110\ngo into computer management.\n\n939\n00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,310\nAnd inside computer management.\n\n940\n00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,195\nIn the navigation menu on the left,\nif it ever comes up.\n\n941\n00:43:07,195 --> 00:43:09,620\n[LAUGH], we will see disk management and\n\n942\n00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,620\nthat's were we can see all\nthe disks on our system.\n\n943\n00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:17,000\nNow, most computers only\nhave one hard drive, right.\n\n944\n00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,110\nBut there's some really cool features\nout there if you have more than\n\n945\n00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,030\none hard drive.\n\n946\n00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,560\nAnd so I've added three\nadditional drives to the system.\n\n947\n00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,300\nThey're brand new completely blank drives.\n\n948\n00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,970\nAnd so the first thing that I see when I\nlog in is this message here asking me to\n\n949\n00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,920\ninitialize the disk.\n\n950\n00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,960\nThat just means getting the system\nready for Windows to use.\n\n951\n00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,550\nNow it's asking me,\nwhat type of disk I wanna make it?\n\n952\n00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,250\nIf I wanna make it an MBR or a GPT disk.\n\n953\n00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,100\nSo let's talk about the difference there.\n\n954\n00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,000\nNow, Wes which one do you want to do,\nthe old or the new?\n\n955\n00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,980\n>> I can do the old one there.\n\n956\n00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,470\n>> Okay.\n>> The traditional PC.\n\n957\n00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,980\nBIOS, if you will.\n\n958\n00:43:53,980 --> 00:44:00,020\nMBR, the Master Boot Record, sits in\nthe first sector of the hard drive.\n\n959\n00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,520\nAnd it's what the traditional BIOS,\n\n960\n00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,710\nBasic Input Output System,\nreferences to load an operating system.\n\n961\n00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,190\nIt does have some limitations.\n\n962\n00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,300\nAnd it is an older way to\nboot an operating system,\n\n963\n00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,920\nand we're moving in,\nI'd say supporting now,\n\n964\n00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,960\na more current firmware based platform,\nand that'll be the GPT.\n\n965\n00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,140\nBut this is the traditional what\nwe've been using since basically\n\n966\n00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,330\nIBM PC I believe,\n\n967\n00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,670\nthe traditional master boot record where\nthe BIOS looks at the hard drive and it\n\n968\n00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,939\nsays I'm gonna load the operating system\nby what I find in that master boot record.\n\n969\n00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,960\n>> And so, if you watch the A+ show,\nyou'll remember the things that we covered\n\n970\n00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,870\nabout primary partitions and logical and\nextended partitions, and how you can\n\n971\n00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,850\nonly have four primary partitions,\nthat kind of thing, those limits.\n\n972\n00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,305\nThat's all characteristic Think of MBR.\n\n973\n00:44:44,305 --> 00:44:49,145\nNow you might ask yourself if\nthat's not as good as GPT the new\n\n974\n00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,655\nstyle why do we still have it?\n\n975\n00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,105\nAnd the reason is compatibility.\n\n976\n00:44:52,105 --> 00:44:54,635\n>> Yup.\n>> The old format MBR will work with\n\n977\n00:44:54,635 --> 00:44:57,055\nLinux boxes and OSX and Windows.\n\n978\n00:44:57,055 --> 00:45:00,039\nYou get Full compatibility even\nolder versions of Windows.\n\n979\n00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:03,220\nGTP the new one, right, that's the GUID or\n\n980\n00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,800\nthe global unique identifier\nperdition table that's the new\n\n981\n00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,660\nmethod of managing perdition on\nthe disk and it's supported by UEFI.\n\n982\n00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,930\n>> Unified extensible firmware inputs.\n\n983\n00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:16,602\n>> Thank you Wes.\n\n984\n00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:18,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So supported by the UEFI boot\n\n985\n00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,570\nsystem and the BIOS replacement.\n\n986\n00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:23,330\n>> Yep.\n>> And it's used on newer systems.\n\n987\n00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,560\nIf you've got a newer system, great.\n\n988\n00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,530\nIf you got an older system\nyou can still stick with MBR.\n\n989\n00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,020\nI'm gonna actually do it this way.\n\n990\n00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,670\nI'm gonna initialize disc one as MBR and\n\n991\n00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:37,040\nthen I'm gonna come down here and\ninitialize disc two.\n\n992\n00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,900\nAs GPT.\n\n993\n00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:39,620\nAlright.\n\n994\n00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,050\nAnd the reason I wanna do that is I wanna\n\n995\n00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,210\nshow you guys that once they're\ninitialized, if I look at them here.\n\n996\n00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,290\nDisc one and disc two.\n\n997\n00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,730\nDo you see the difference?\n\n998\n00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,400\nI don't.\n\n999\n00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,830\nSo there's not much of a difference,\nright.\n\n1000\n00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:59,876\nThey are both 127 gig discs and on the MBR\ndisc I have 127 gigs on the GPT disk,\n\n1001\n00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:05,710\n126.88 gigs and that's because\nUEFI needs a little bit of room\n\n1002\n00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,290\nat the beginning to be able to identify\nthe partition and see what's on there.\n\n1003\n00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:12,560\nOther than that,\nthe disks now function identically, right?\n\n1004\n00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,870\nWell, I shouldn't say identically.\n\n1005\n00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,141\nIt's gonna come down to how\nwe create our partitions.\n\n1006\n00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:16,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> But, so\n\n1007\n00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,930\nif you got a UEFI system though,\nGPT is the new way to go.\n\n1008\n00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,130\nThat's really where you should be.\n\n1009\n00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,800\n>> And that's where get the ability to\ntake advantage of those new features that\n\n1010\n00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,660\nwe just don't see in the traditional,\nI say traditional, the older MBR.\n\n1011\n00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,340\n>> Format.\n\n1012\n00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n1013\n00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,030\nNow when we create these,\n\n1014\n00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:36,400\nthey're both flagged as basic\ndisks in Windows, all right?\n\n1015\n00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,370\nAnd a basic disk is our traditional model.\n\n1016\n00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:41,840\nYou'll see even my disk up here is\nflagged as basic, but these are basic and\n\n1017\n00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,870\nthat means we can now create\npartitions on these disks.\n\n1018\n00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,490\nAnd the partition limitations\nare still very real and true.\n\n1019\n00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:53,740\nIf I come in here and create a partition,\nI'm just flagging a space of that drive to\n\n1020\n00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,480\nbe accessible to the OS, usually by\na drive letter, right, mapped to a letter.\n\n1021\n00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,060\nAnd so I can, maybe I'll make\na 36 gig partition real quick.\n\n1022\n00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,020\n>> And while Don is doing that,\n\n1023\n00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,220\nkeep in mind that even though we're using\nthe Windows Based disk management utility.\n\n1024\n00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,280\nAnd the partitioning through MBR.\n\n1025\n00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,760\nIt doesn't matter if I launch,\nlet's say I go to dual boot system and\n\n1026\n00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,480\nwe launch Linux.\n\n1027\n00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,400\nAnd Linux is using completely\ndifferent file system.\n\n1028\n00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,280\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n1029\n00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,140\nThat partition is gonna be seen by\nmultiple all operating systems.\n\n1030\n00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,240\nBecause what it's doing is it's modifying\nthat master partition table and that is\n\n1031\n00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,710\njust a standard format, so even though\nwe use a Windows specific utility here\n\n1032\n00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,600\nthe LINUX based, or UNIX, they're gonna\nbe able to see these partitions as well.\n\n1033\n00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,020\n>> Yep, and so, what I'm doing is,\nI'm just going through and,\n\n1034\n00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,580\nI thought that the disk got e, it did.\n\n1035\n00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,395\nYep, it's trying to\ndouble me up on e here.\n\n1036\n00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:44,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's choose f.\n\n1037\n00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,620\nSo, I'm creating these, and\nI'm just kind of labeling it here, so\n\n1038\n00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,190\nI can remember which one is which and\nthere.\n\n1039\n00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,440\nOkay.\n\n1040\n00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,590\nSo I've created a 36 gig\npartition on both of them.\n\n1041\n00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:01,607\nNotice the 36 gig\npartition on the MBR disk.\n\n1042\n00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:04,608\nIt's got 35.16 gigs available, and\n\n1043\n00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:10,890\nthe 36 gig partition that I created on\nthe GPT disk has 35.16 gigs available.\n\n1044\n00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,640\nAnd for an end user, they're not\ngoing to see any difference here.\n\n1045\n00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,890\nSo it really just comes down\nto the operating system.\n\n1046\n00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:21,850\nA newer UEFI systems, take advantage of\nwhat GPT has to offer and switch to it.\n\n1047\n00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,980\nOn older systems,\nyou can stick with MBR And\n\n1048\n00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,460\nit really doesn't make\nthat much difference.\n\n1049\n00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,180\n>> And we discuss it more in\ndepth in other shows too.\n\n1050\n00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,440\nThe redundancy that you get in this new\ntype to boot your operating system and\n\n1051\n00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,780\nstuff too, and it really has a lot of\nfeatures, a lot security features too.\n\n1052\n00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,730\nA lot of things that\nthe older MBR didn't have.\n\n1053\n00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:39,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n1054\n00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:44,700\nNow where the real fun stuff starts\nis when we switch from a basic disk\n\n1055\n00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,330\nover to something more advanced,\nover to what's called a dynamic disk.\n\n1056\n00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,690\nWhen we have a dynamic disk,\n\n1057\n00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:54,240\ninstead of creating partitions like this,\nwe create volumes, and\n\n1058\n00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,140\nthe volumes have a lot of really cool\nbells and whistles to them, all right?\n\n1059\n00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:04,150\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\ninitialize this last disk, and\n\n1060\n00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,240\nI'll initialize it GTP, that's fine.\n\n1061\n00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,580\nAnd then I'm going to come through and\nconvert these to dynamic disks.\n\n1062\n00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,774\nNow, I do want to make\na comment real quick.\n\n1063\n00:49:12,774 --> 00:49:14,770\nIt's a one-way conversion, okay?\n\n1064\n00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,210\nYou can convert a basic\ndisk to a dynamic disk.\n\n1065\n00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,030\nYou won't lose any data and\nit happens really fast, all right?\n\n1066\n00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,360\nIf you want to convert back,\nyou've gotta back up all your data,\n\n1067\n00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,890\ndelete all the partitions,\nreinitialize the disc as basic,\n\n1068\n00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,310\nrecreate the partitions and\nrestore your data.\n\n1069\n00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,250\nSo it's a pain in\nthe butt to go backwards.\n\n1070\n00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,470\nAll right?\n\n1071\n00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,340\nWhy would you want to go back?\n\n1072\n00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:35,920\n>> I don't know.\n\n1073\n00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,810\nMy personal thing is it's blue\nto start with, and my thing,\n\n1074\n00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,940\nyou can't have one of those why oh why\ndidn't I just take the blue pill moments.\n\n1075\n00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,210\nI mean once That's it.\n\n1076\n00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,500\nOnce you go forward, there's no\n>> Yeah.\n\n1077\n00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Going back.\n\n1078\n00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,460\n>> And for most people,\n\n1079\n00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,880\nyou want to go dynamic because you\nget some cool features out of it.\n\n1080\n00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,000\nSo why would you go back?\n\n1081\n00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,390\nWell let's say you wanted\nto dual boot with Linux or\n\n1082\n00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,150\nother OS's,\ndynamic disks are a Microsoft thing.\n\n1083\n00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:00,410\nSo we're killing our\ncompatibility with other systems.\n\n1084\n00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,670\nIf you just run Windows,\ndon't worry about, not a problem, right?\n\n1085\n00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,790\nAnd on the exam, it's a Windows exam.\n\n1086\n00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,760\nSo we don't worry about the other OS's.\n\n1087\n00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,450\nBut in real life land,\nthat's where we have our issue.\n\n1088\n00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,960\n>> Gotcha.\n>> So I'm gonna convert it, and\n\n1089\n00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,130\nI'm actually going to convert\nall three of those disks,\n\n1090\n00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,080\ndisk one, two, and three,\nand we'll convert them over.\n\n1091\n00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,150\nIt's telling me that I'm converting\nfrom basic to dynamic, and\n\n1092\n00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:26,370\nit's telling me that it is\na pain the butt to convert back.\n\n1093\n00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,770\nI'm okay with that.\n\n1094\n00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,440\nIt's gonna give a go at it.\n\n1095\n00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,240\nIt happens pretty quickly, and\n\n1096\n00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,980\nnotice how the discs just changed\nfrom blue to what is that called?\n\n1097\n00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,200\nCrud, I think?\n\n1098\n00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,522\n>> It's something that they\ncame out with in the 70s..\n\n1099\n00:50:40,522 --> 00:50:41,860\n>> Okra?\n[LAUGH] Avocado?\n\n1100\n00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,830\nSome kind of color there,\nsome kind of puke yellow green color.\n\n1101\n00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,115\nAnd now we're just getting gross.\n\n1102\n00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:51,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But anyhow, it changes color.\n\n1103\n00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,370\nAnd the reason it's changing colors\nis it's no longer a partition.\n\n1104\n00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:55,630\nNow it's a volume.\n\n1105\n00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:59,700\nDown here in the legend where where it\nused to say primary partition, right.\n\n1106\n00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,090\nNow it says simple volume.\n\n1107\n00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,810\nAnd those are volumes.\n\n1108\n00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,140\nAnd volumes have a ton of cool\nstuff that we can do with them.\n\n1109\n00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,670\n>> Remember that a partition is going\nto be isolated to a single disk.\n\n1110\n00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:12,430\nAnd we're gonna see here the volumes,\n\n1111\n00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:16,110\nthey don't have that limitation where\nthey only have to be on a single disk.\n\n1112\n00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:19,810\nYou're gonna see some things that we're\ngonna see here that really make a volume\n\n1113\n00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,848\na good feature because we're gonna\nuse a lot of multiple drives.\n\n1114\n00:51:22,848 --> 00:51:26,810\nVolumes can span multiple drives\npartitions usually, well, not usually,\n\n1115\n00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,320\nare isolated to a single disc.\n\n1116\n00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,330\n>> If I have a volume, right?\n\n1117\n00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:37,910\nSo I might create a new simple volume here\nand I'll create another 36 gig volume.\n\n1118\n00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:39,720\nAll right.\n\n1119\n00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,728\nWhich will be my G drive.\n\n1120\n00:51:46,265 --> 00:51:47,078\nAll right.\n\n1121\n00:51:47,078 --> 00:51:50,990\nAnd let's say that I'm writing\ndata to this new volume.\n\n1122\n00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:54,120\nI'm starting to copy stuff in there,\nyou know, it's 36 gigs.\n\n1123\n00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,960\nI'm copying and it fills up.\n\n1124\n00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,540\nIt runs out of space.\n\n1125\n00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,390\nOkay?\n\n1126\n00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,700\nOnce you're out of space,\nwell this is a volume.\n\n1127\n00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,020\nWe can extend it.\n\n1128\n00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,300\nA standard partition can be extended.\n\n1129\n00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,890\nYou can extend it to fill\nthe empty space on your drive.\n\n1130\n00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,420\nBut what if there is no\nempty space on your drive?\n\n1131\n00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:18,630\nYou can expand a simple volume\nto span across more than disk.\n\n1132\n00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,380\nSo I can right-click on it and\nI can choose to extend it.\n\n1133\n00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:27,850\nAnd when I extend it,\nI can extend it on to other disks.\n\n1134\n00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:32,545\nSo, for example, I'll pick Disk 2 and I'm\n\n1135\n00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:38,175\ngonna add 36 gigs more and\n\n1136\n00:52:38,175 --> 00:52:42,415\nfinish that up and\nnow I've got a spanned volume, right?\n\n1137\n00:52:42,415 --> 00:52:44,910\nI called it simple volume,\nit's not simple any more.\n\n1138\n00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,420\nBut see how it shows g: and g:?\n\n1139\n00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,355\nThat's that same volume.\n\n1140\n00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:49,670\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n1141\n00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,490\nAnd one of things to keep in\nmind too is that you'll when\n\n1142\n00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:57,030\nhe created that simple volume it did give\nhim the option to specify a specific type,\n\n1143\n00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,140\nexcuse me size,\non that single volume he just created.\n\n1144\n00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,310\nYou're going to notice it's going\nto be a little bit different\n\n1145\n00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,440\nwhen we move into the other type\nvolumes that you're gonna see.\n\n1146\n00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,160\nYou won't have that option to basically\nchoose whatever size you want within this\n\n1147\n00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,170\nindividual container.\n\n1148\n00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,430\n>> Yeah, they don't have to match.\n\n1149\n00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:17,840\nI can extend this even further and so\nmaybe I'll extend it onto disk three.\n\n1150\n00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,230\nAnd this time I'll add 40 gigs, right?\n\n1151\n00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:26,060\nSo not matching oops, I guess it\nwould help if I chose the right disk.\n\n1152\n00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:31,810\nSo if I added 40 gigs this time, right?\n\n1153\n00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:35,960\nSo now, what it's done is it\nspanned across three drives.\n\n1154\n00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,210\nI've got I picked numbers\nthat make it hard math.\n\n1155\n00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:38,790\nRight?\n\n1156\n00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,570\nSo 36 plus 36 plus 40, which is 112.\n\n1157\n00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,810\nSo 112 gigs of storage in my G drive.\n\n1158\n00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,650\nBut here's the thing.\n\n1159\n00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:52,270\nThere is absolutely no\nredundancy provided by this.\n\n1160\n00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,310\nAll right.\n\n1161\n00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,900\nWhen I write to the G drive,\nit's gonna to fill up this part first.\n\n1162\n00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,680\nAnd when it gets completely full,\nthen it will write to this part.\n\n1163\n00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,990\nAnd when it gets completely full,\nthen it will write to this last part.\n\n1164\n00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,870\nAll right.\n\n1165\n00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:09,735\nIf I lose any one of those drives, the\nentire volume is bad, I lose all my data,\n\n1166\n00:54:09,735 --> 00:54:10,625\nall right?\n\n1167\n00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:13,345\nSo there is no redundancy,\nthis is not RAID.\n\n1168\n00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:17,445\nSome of you might be saying at home,\noh, it's like RAID 0 or whatever.\n\n1169\n00:54:17,445 --> 00:54:19,260\nYou're striping across the disks.\n\n1170\n00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,630\nIt's not a stripe.\n\n1171\n00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,170\nIt's writing it to one disk at\na time until that disk is full.\n\n1172\n00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:28,300\n>> And when it comes to the span volumes,\nthe span volume's really about\n\n1173\n00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,711\nkind of future-proofing your overall\nstorage capacity from I would say,\n\n1174\n00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:34,790\na limitation or exhaustion.\n\n1175\n00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:37,480\nAnd, I mean, we know,\nhigh-definition files,\n\n1176\n00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,920\nyou can run through a drive capacity real\nquick and then you're like, oh my gosh,\n\n1177\n00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,470\nI gotta go out and\nI gotta buy a new hard drive.\n\n1178\n00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,800\nWell, you don't really have to do that\nhere when you have this volume set up.\n\n1179\n00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,650\nYes, you might still have to buy\nan additional hard drive, but\n\n1180\n00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,060\nyou don't have to format\nit as a separate container.\n\n1181\n00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,140\nYou can just add to this container and\nit really helps to future-proof it.\n\n1182\n00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,250\njust from those drive capacity\nlimitations that we have.\n\n1183\n00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,910\n>> Now let's say that I am\nworried about redundancy.\n\n1184\n00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:04,930\nI do want to be able to\nsurvive a drive failure.\n\n1185\n00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:08,530\nWhen you right click on an empty space and\nyou create a new volume, you actually have\n\n1186\n00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:13,510\na couple of choices here and you'll see\nnew strike volume, new mirror volume.\n\n1187\n00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:18,160\nA striped volume that is striped, but\nit's raid zero, it's not redundant.\n\n1188\n00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:23,320\nRaid 5 on the other hand, that striping\nwith parity, that is redundant.\n\n1189\n00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,560\nAnd I'm not sure why it's grayed out here.\n\n1190\n00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,470\nBut if I do a new mirrored volume,\nthat's raid one.\n\n1191\n00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,310\nTwo copies, you know,\nyou're data is stored in two places,\n\n1192\n00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,130\nif you lose one drive,\nthe other one's got it.\n\n1193\n00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,790\nI'll create a new mirrored\nvolume real quick.\n\n1194\n00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,750\nIf I do a new mirrored volume,\nI just specify the two discs that\n\n1195\n00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:42,610\nI want to contain the volume, and\nI specify the size I want it to be.\n\n1196\n00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,220\nI'll just do 16 gigs this time.\n\n1197\n00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,900\nSee how it just updated\nboth of them to be 16 gigs?\n\n1198\n00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,390\nIt's a mirror, they need to be the same.\n\n1199\n00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:56,826\nWhen I hit next and I finish that up,\nI'll call this my mirrored volume.\n\n1200\n00:56:04,918 --> 00:56:06,649\nAnd we'll let that create.\n\n1201\n00:56:06,649 --> 00:56:09,880\nIt's gonna create it and\nit'll be on two different drives And\n\n1202\n00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,609\nanything I write to the first drive\nwill be copied to the second drive and\n\n1203\n00:56:13,609 --> 00:56:17,430\nit's invisible to the user because\nit just gets one drive letter right?\n\n1204\n00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,290\nThey don't know there's\nactually two drives.\n\n1205\n00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,810\nThe cool thing is if I lose disk one,\n\n1206\n00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,980\ndisk two has an exact copy of that\ndata and so now I survive the failure.\n\n1207\n00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,330\nSo essentially this is the your\nsoftware implementation of RAID.\n\n1208\n00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,910\nRight this is not at the hardware level\nwhere a RAID controller would do it.\n\n1209\n00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:37,500\n>> And I'm glad you mention that,\nbecause I didn't think about it.\n\n1210\n00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,010\nHardware RAID right?\n\n1211\n00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,400\nTen times better, right?\n\n1212\n00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,370\nAny time you implement something in\nhardware, it's gonna be faster and\n\n1213\n00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,290\nmore stable.\n\n1214\n00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:47,190\nThis is done in software so\nevery time you write to the hard drive,\n\n1215\n00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,740\nthe operating system is having\nto duplicate that write.\n\n1216\n00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,238\nIt's more work on the system.\n\n1217\n00:56:51,238 --> 00:56:54,330\nIt works, but it's poor man's RAID.\n\n1218\n00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,460\n>> Yeah, and that really is the case,\n\n1219\n00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,200\nwe call that hardware accelerated\nversus software accelerated.\n\n1220\n00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,160\nAnytime you can put that in hardware and\n\n1221\n00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,810\nyou are freeing up the CPU\nwith its processing cycles.\n\n1222\n00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,950\nAnd any time that it is software assisted,\n\n1223\n00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:10,030\nyou are going to be robbing the rest of\nthe system of its CPU processing power.\n\n1224\n00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,208\nAnd you can see this in\nsomething like A+ here,\n\n1225\n00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:16,238\nback to some of the earlier\nexpansion cards.\n\n1226\n00:57:16,238 --> 00:57:17,218\nWhat's they did,\n\n1227\n00:57:17,218 --> 00:57:21,640\nthey went from software assisted in\nthe early days to hardware assisted later.\n\n1228\n00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,270\n>> Yeah, now if I had left\nthese as basic disks, right?\n\n1229\n00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,810\nBasic disks can't do these\nspan volumes and stuff.\n\n1230\n00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,780\nThis is a function of\nbeing in dynamic disk.\n\n1231\n00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,560\nSo that's why we'd wanna switch\nover that to gain this stability.\n\n1232\n00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:37,530\nIf you have a hardware RAID controller,\nthere's not really any need to do this.\n\n1233\n00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:40,810\nYou can stay basic disk,\nkeep your compatibility, and\n\n1234\n00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:43,470\nuse the RAID controller to be able to\nprovide this functionality, right?\n\n1235\n00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:47,300\nIf you're not going to use span volumes\nand stripe volumes and all that stuff\n\n1236\n00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,090\ninside of Windows, there's not really\na driving factor to make you go dynamic.\n\n1237\n00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,790\nSo don't feel like you need\nto convert to dynamic and\n\n1238\n00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,540\nbe careful because you can't\nreally go back easily.\n\n1239\n00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,660\nYou would have to back up your data,\nwipe the drive,\n\n1240\n00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:03,450\nformat it, recreate it as basic,\nand then restore your data to it.\n\n1241\n00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:07,240\nAnd that's a lot of effort.\n\n1242\n00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,080\nI'm curious why I wasn't able\nto create a RAID 5 volume.\n\n1243\n00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,950\nAnd I'm wondering if it's because I\nhave I've mixed things at this point so\n\n1244\n00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:23,270\nI've got mixed GPT and all that.\n\n1245\n00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:29,630\nSo so I wonder if I delete all\nthe stuff out of here if I can\n\n1246\n00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:34,277\nget it let me create a RAID 5 one,\nlet's just see.\n\n1247\n00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:37,960\n>> It's thinking about it.\n\n1248\n00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,331\n>> Yeah, I'm just going through and\n\n1249\n00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:44,030\ndeleting all the partitions that I made or\ntrying to.\n\n1250\n00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,920\nAnd once they're deleted,\nthey're all unallocated.\n\n1251\n00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,660\nBut, see how they've\ngone back to basic now?\n\n1252\n00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,820\nI'd converted them to dynamic, but\nnow that the volumes are all gone,\n\n1253\n00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,840\nit's gone back to basic.\n\n1254\n00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,445\nBack to basic,\nthat's like a store motto or something.\n\n1255\n00:58:59,445 --> 00:59:00,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I can come in here and I can,\n\n1256\n00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,235\nsee I can convert these to MBR.\n\n1257\n00:59:03,235 --> 00:59:08,140\nThat software rate might\nnot be compatible with GPT.\n\n1258\n00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,696\nLet me convert them back to MBR.\n\n1259\n00:59:11,655 --> 00:59:13,880\nOnce they're empty,\nyou can do all sorts of stuff to it.\n\n1260\n00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,480\nYou get a lot of flexibility.\n\n1261\n00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,072\nAnd now I'm gonna convert them to dynamic.\n\n1262\n00:59:18,072 --> 00:59:20,160\nSo, I'll just get all three of those.\n\n1263\n00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160\nSo all three of them are MBR now and\n\n1264\n00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,710\nI'm converting the dynamic and\nstill not an option.\n\n1265\n00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:27,890\nI have to look that up during\nthe break and see what it is.\n\n1266\n00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,400\nThere must be some requirement\nthere that I'm not meeting.\n\n1267\n00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,630\nThe main requirement for RAID 5 is\nyou have to have three drives, right?\n\n1268\n00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,330\nRAID 5 requires three or more drives, but\n\n1269\n00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,960\nI've got three drives right\nhere that it's unhappy with.\n\n1270\n00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,390\nSo there must be some\nrequirement that I'm missing.\n\n1271\n00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,699\nIt'll be something silly and\nonce I know it we can get that set.\n\n1272\n00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:48,850\nBut I don't think it requires,\nmaybe it does require GPT.\n\n1273\n00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:49,459\nWho knows?\n\n1274\n00:59:50,945 --> 00:59:52,610\nWe'll give that a shot real quick.\n\n1275\n00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:55,120\nOtherwise, I'll sort it\nout during the break.\n\n1276\n00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,180\nBut so as far as managing these disks\nright here we got a couple of good things\n\n1277\n00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,370\nand I'm pretty easy to get set up.\n\n1278\n01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,930\nAll this is in software, though,\n\n1279\n01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,190\njust keep in mind hardware RAID\ncontroller's really the way to go.\n\n1280\n01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:09,550\nAll right, now,\nI did all this through the GUI, right?\n\n1281\n01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,530\nThe graphical user interface.\n\n1282\n01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:13,540\nYou can do it all through\nthe command line, too.\n\n1283\n01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:17,210\nSo we've got that,\nit's called the DiskPart Utility.\n\n1284\n01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:20,040\nIt's a command line utility and\nit does show up on the exam, so\n\n1285\n01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:25,000\nwe need to at least have a basic idea\nof how it works and what it does.\n\n1286\n01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,260\nAnd still you know I converted to GPT,\nstill no option to do RAID 5.\n\n1287\n01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,310\nAll right,\nI'll look it up during the break.\n\n1288\n01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,130\nBut let's see we got a few minutes.\n\n1289\n01:00:36,295 --> 01:00:37,905\nLet's do this.\n\n1290\n01:00:37,905 --> 01:00:39,385\nWe got about five minutes\nbefore the break, but\n\n1291\n01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:42,255\nI don't know that we can do the command\nline stuff in only five minutes.\n\n1292\n01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:45,124\nSo when we stop that will give\nme a chance to look up and\n\n1293\n01:00:45,124 --> 01:00:46,905\nsee why can't you RAID 5 here.\n\n1294\n01:00:46,905 --> 01:00:49,597\nAnd when we get back, we will dive\ninto that command line and tackle it.\n\n1295\n01:00:49,597 --> 01:00:51,060\nSound good?\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n1296\n01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,052\n>> All right.\nSo ladies and\n\n1297\n01:00:52,052 --> 01:00:55,961\ngentlemen, stay tuned for the exciting\nconclusion to our storage section\n\n1298\n01:00:55,961 --> 01:00:59,821\nhere as we dive into that junk [LAUGH] and\nfind out why it's making me angry.\n\n1299\n01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:01,690\n>> How about a little\nbit of optimization too?\n\n1300\n01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,010\nAfter we get back.\n\n1301\n01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:03,970\nFile fragmentation.\n\n1302\n01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:05,360\n>> Oh yeah, we need to do defrags.\n\n1303\n01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:05,860\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yep.\n\n1304\n01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,670\nWe'll tackle that too.\n\n1305\n01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,610\nAnd then, we may or\n\n1306\n01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,770\nmay not get to storage spaces,\nwe'll see if we have enough time.\n\n1307\n01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,196\nSo, all right ladies and\ngentleman stay tuned.\n\n1308\n01:01:11,196 --> 01:01:12,405\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1309\n01:01:12,405 --> 01:01:13,239\n>> See ya soon.\n\n1310\n01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:19,780\n[MUSIC]\n\n1311\n01:01:23,988 --> 01:01:30,280\n[MUSIC]\n\n1312\n01:01:31,864 --> 01:01:33,600\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1313\n01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,320\nSo, before the break, I was showing\nyou guys how to create partitions and\n\n1314\n01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,870\nthings like that using the GUI.\n\n1315\n01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,320\nI took the easy part.\n\n1316\n01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,680\nNow, Senor Wes is going to show us\nthe command line, the DiskPart utility and\n\n1317\n01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,210\nhow we can do stuff from stem.\n\n1318\n01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:55,170\n>> Yes that's right, so\nif we could switch over to my screen here.\n\n1319\n01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,530\nSo we still have Disk Management open so\nyou can see the graphical user interface\n\n1320\n01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:02,040\nbut I just gonna launch\na command prompt here.\n\n1321\n01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:08,750\nAnd then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to\ntype in our DiskPart command, hopefully.\n\n1322\n01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,530\nAnd here we go, we've got DiskPart.\n\n1323\n01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:14,658\nNow keep in mind that this is a graphical,\nin the background we got the GUI and\n\n1324\n01:02:14,658 --> 01:02:17,090\nthen what we we here is just\nour command line interface.\n\n1325\n01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,720\nAnd everything we can do from a graphical\nuser interface a lot of times you'll see\n\n1326\n01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,020\nyou can do even more\nwithin our command prompt.\n\n1327\n01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,550\nSo what we're going to do here is some\nof the basic commands that you have.\n\n1328\n01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:30,090\nYou got to first identify the disk\nit is that you want to work with.\n\n1329\n01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:33,060\nSo what we do here is\na command called list disk.\n\n1330\n01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,090\nBut before I do that, I want to show you,\nyou can get the commands and\n\n1331\n01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:41,420\nsome of the help within DiskPart, if\nyou're not quite sure just by typing help.\n\n1332\n01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:47,130\nAnd it will show you all of\nthe available options with DiskPart.\n\n1333\n01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,360\nYou can see there's quite\na few of them here.\n\n1334\n01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:55,909\nBut the one that we're going to look for\nis going to be list disk.\n\n1335\n01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,550\nWhat that's going to do is it's going to\nshow us all the current hard drives that\n\n1336\n01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,640\nare attached to the machine.\n\n1337\n01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,340\nIt is very, very important when\nyou're using this command that you\n\n1338\n01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:09,040\ndouble check and\nselect the appropriate disk.\n\n1339\n01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:13,010\nYou don't want to format one of these\ndisks in the system that contains valuable\n\n1340\n01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,620\ninformation and\nthen learn about that later.\n\n1341\n01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:20,003\nSo to do that now that we know which\ndisk we're going to be working with them\n\n1342\n01:03:20,003 --> 01:03:21,780\nwill be working with disk 1.\n\n1343\n01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,300\nSo I'm gonna do a select.\n\n1344\n01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:28,440\nAnd DiskPart is kinda forgiving\non some of these commands so\n\n1345\n01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,720\nI could actually do sel\nrather than select, but for\n\n1346\n01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:37,590\nthe exam we want to go ahead and\ntype out these these commands completely.\n\n1347\n01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:41,010\nSo we'll do a select disk and\nthen we're going to label it.\n\n1348\n01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:44,321\nWe're going to do disk1,\noops let me put a space there or disk 1.\n\n1349\n01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,910\nNow again, as a piece of advice.\n\n1350\n01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,620\nJust because it did say\nthis disk is selected,\n\n1351\n01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,220\nwe're really gonna wanna make sure that.\n\n1352\n01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:55,800\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nrerun that command that says list disk.\n\n1353\n01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,530\nIf I can type it.\n\n1354\n01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:02,723\nAnd you can see the little asterisk symbol\nright next to disk 1 that reassures that\n\n1355\n01:04:02,723 --> 01:04:04,075\nwe do have that selected.\n\n1356\n01:04:04,075 --> 01:04:06,698\nAnd the next thing that we have to do\nis we gotta create that container.\n\n1357\n01:04:06,698 --> 01:04:08,718\nAnd that's what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna create a partition.\n\n1358\n01:04:08,718 --> 01:04:12,983\nSo what we're gonna do\nis our create Again,\n\n1359\n01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:17,790\npartition, prime, or I should say primary.\n\n1360\n01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,800\nSo we don't abbreviate it.\n\n1361\n01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,440\nI could do a create part prime,\nbut we're not gonna do that.\n\n1362\n01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,880\nWe can do this, and you'll see that it\nhas created the partition on this drive.\n\n1363\n01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:35,081\nSo now what we can do is,\nwe can do a list partition.\n\n1364\n01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:40,065\nAnd you can see that we do\nhave a partition created here,\n\n1365\n01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:44,541\nwe do have that reserved\npartition there as well.\n\n1366\n01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:49,570\nAnd do we really want to do anything\nmore than just creating the primary?\n\n1367\n01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:51,130\n>> Let's go ahead and format it.\n\n1368\n01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:55,760\n>> All right, so we're gonna do\nour format command, oops, maybe.\n\n1369\n01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,577\nFormat.\n>> Did you already select the partition?\n\n1370\n01:04:57,577 --> 01:04:59,203\n>> It is selected there.\n\n1371\n01:04:59,203 --> 01:04:59,994\n>> Oh, excellent, good.\n\n1372\n01:04:59,994 --> 01:05:01,275\n>> Right there.\n>> I'm not paying attention.\n\n1373\n01:05:01,275 --> 01:05:01,884\n>> That's okay.\n\n1374\n01:05:01,884 --> 01:05:03,985\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's okay, so\n\n1375\n01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:09,060\nwe're gonna do a format, and\nI believe it's file system equals NTFS,\n\n1376\n01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:13,430\nand we want to label these,\nwe need a label equals.\n\n1377\n01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,858\nWe call this-\n>> Whatever you want.\n\n1378\n01:05:15,858 --> 01:05:17,448\n>> Oh, we'll just call it data.\n\n1379\n01:05:17,448 --> 01:05:20,400\nAnd then we're just gonna\nformat the whole thing.\n\n1380\n01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,910\n>> I would throw a quick on the end of it.\n\n1381\n01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,420\n>> Throw a quick?\n\n1382\n01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,540\nOkay, yep.\n>> And that'll make it do quick format,\n\n1383\n01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:28,220\notherwise we'll be here, well probably not\ntoo long cuz that's a virtual machine, but\n\n1384\n01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,720\nin real life land,\nyou can be here for hours.\n\n1385\n01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,428\n>> Yeah, and\n\n1386\n01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:35,320\nyou can do a quick format on any drive\nthat has ever been formatted to NTFS.\n\n1387\n01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,002\nYou don't have to go through that,\nI guess slow format, so\n\n1388\n01:05:38,002 --> 01:05:39,300\nwe'll go ahead and do that.\n\n1389\n01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,174\n>> So much for that quick part.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1390\n01:05:43,174 --> 01:05:45,009\n>> There we go, there we go.\n\n1391\n01:05:45,009 --> 01:05:50,366\nNow what we're gonna do is we're gonna go\nahead and do our list partition again.\n\n1392\n01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:53,149\nOops, partition.\n\n1393\n01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:57,360\nDid it not do that?\n\n1394\n01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,080\n>> You left out a t.\n\n1395\n01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,270\n>> Oh, yes.\n\n1396\n01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:00,400\n>> That's parition.\n\n1397\n01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,590\n>> You have to be able to spell, Wes.\n\n1398\n01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:08,290\nAnd we can see that, as primary partition.\n\n1399\n01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:08,820\nWe're gonna do a,\n\n1400\n01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,820\nlet's do a list volume now,\ncuz this is the next command that you do.\n\n1401\n01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,441\nYou do a list volume.\n\n1402\n01:06:13,441 --> 01:06:16,919\nAnd we can do a list vol, but again,\nremember for the test you want to go and\n\n1403\n01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:17,606\nspell it out.\n\n1404\n01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:20,776\nAnd now we can see that partition\nin the volume that we just created.\n\n1405\n01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:26,530\nYou can see right here that we\ndo have it formatted to NTFS.\n\n1406\n01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:30,100\nAnd it's a healthy partition.\n\n1407\n01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,613\nAnd we could also create an active\npartition here if we wanted to.\n\n1408\n01:06:33,613 --> 01:06:37,141\nIf we're gonna boot to this drive\nwe're gonna wanna make sure that\n\n1409\n01:06:37,141 --> 01:06:41,551\nit's an active partition, cuz it lets\nwindows know that, hey, this is where your\n\n1410\n01:06:41,551 --> 01:06:45,350\noperating system's located\n>> The only other thing I'd do is assign\n\n1411\n01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,320\na drive letter to it, right?\n\n1412\n01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,600\n>> Okay, yeah.\n>> So we'd issue the assign command.\n\n1413\n01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,320\nAnd if you just do assign by itself,\nit grabs whatever letter is next-\n\n1414\n01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,129\n>> Yeah, sequentially, right?\n\n1415\n01:06:53,129 --> 01:06:55,361\n>> Yep.\nOr you can do assign letter and\n\n1416\n01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:59,380\nspecify a letter, but\nthat's usually good enough right there.\n\n1417\n01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,160\n>> We'll do our list vol,\nagain volume, guys.\n\n1418\n01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,880\nLike I said some of these commands like\nyou've seen in other shows you can\n\n1419\n01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,490\nabbreviate.\n\n1420\n01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:08,468\nThis is one of those that you can, but for\nthe test, know your full syntax just so\n\n1421\n01:07:08,468 --> 01:07:09,584\nyou get that question right.\n\n1422\n01:07:09,584 --> 01:07:12,730\n>> Yeah, so now we've got an E drive.\n\n1423\n01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:13,930\nIt's formatted NTFS.\n\n1424\n01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,240\nIt's ready to rock.\n\n1425\n01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,370\nAnd if you switch back to the GUI OS-\n>> Okay, yeah, definitely.\n\n1426\n01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:20,260\n>> We'll see the graphical user\ninterface shows us this new partition.\n\n1427\n01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:23,300\nWell not, oh yeah,\nactually it shows us right there, Disk 1.\n\n1428\n01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,040\nWe got data, the E drive.\n\n1429\n01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,620\nSo, you might ask yourself, wait a minute.\n\n1430\n01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,750\nIf I could've done this in the GUI,\n\n1431\n01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,980\nwhy would I suffer through\nthat command line interface?\n\n1432\n01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,200\nAnd the reason is with the CLI,\nyou can automate things.\n\n1433\n01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,770\nYou can write a script\nto run those commands.\n\n1434\n01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:40,222\nYou can't write a script to automate\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n1435\n01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:40,812\n>> I gotta step back.\n\n1436\n01:07:40,812 --> 01:07:44,600\nJay can write a script to automate this,\nWes cannot.\n\n1437\n01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,920\n>> Well, yeah, yeah.\n\n1438\n01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,158\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have to be in that scripting\n\n1439\n01:07:47,158 --> 01:07:47,909\nmindset, I suppose.\n\n1440\n01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:50,885\n>> Yeah, he's our,\nhe practices very good script-fu.\n\n1441\n01:07:50,885 --> 01:07:51,577\n>> There you go.\n\n1442\n01:07:51,577 --> 01:07:53,222\n>> He gives good script.\n\n1443\n01:07:53,222 --> 01:07:55,509\n[LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow, [LAUGH] so\n\n1444\n01:07:55,509 --> 01:07:57,224\nyou can automate that.\n\n1445\n01:07:57,224 --> 01:08:00,890\nIf you're gonna doing this on a large\nscale or whatever that can be handy.\n\n1446\n01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:03,340\nFor most of us though,\nwe're just gonna use the GUI.\n\n1447\n01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:06,636\n>> You know, another thing comes to\nmind with being a server administrator,\n\n1448\n01:08:06,636 --> 01:08:08,008\nhow about core installation?\n\n1449\n01:08:08,008 --> 01:08:11,287\nNow we're gonna talk about that in\nanother class, but we do have certain\n\n1450\n01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,262\ninstallations of servers out there\nwhere there is no interface.\n\n1451\n01:08:14,262 --> 01:08:16,975\nAnd we might need to be able\nto do this via that interface.\n\n1452\n01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:19,345\n>> And you'll have to use\nit because there's no GUI.\n\n1453\n01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,535\nYeah, so in those scenarios.\n\n1454\n01:08:20,535 --> 01:08:23,819\nWindows 8 doesn't support that though so\nwe don't have to worry about that yet, but\n\n1455\n01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:25,023\nthat is another utilization.\n\n1456\n01:08:25,023 --> 01:08:26,735\n>> Okay, very good, very good.\n\n1457\n01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:31,740\n>> All right, so\nas far as our disk creation and\n\n1458\n01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,550\nfunction and so on, I think that\npretty much wraps it up for those.\n\n1459\n01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,790\nWe just still have two\nmore things to hit on.\n\n1460\n01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:42,290\nOne of which is easy but important and\nother one which is really super cool.\n\n1461\n01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:44,010\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n>> So let's start off with easy.\n\n1462\n01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:47,970\nWhich is gonna be managing\nsystem fragmentation, all right?\n\n1463\n01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,550\nFor years and years, right, for\n\n1464\n01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:53,170\nthe longest time, people have known that\nas you write files to your hard drive and\n\n1465\n01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:57,180\ndelete files that the system\nslowly becomes fragmented.\n\n1466\n01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:01,580\nAnd the NTFS file system has\nbuilt-in defragmentation into it, so\n\n1467\n01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:04,040\nit actually defragments\nitself pretty well.\n\n1468\n01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,650\nBut with the new larger and\nlarger drives that we're getting,\n\n1469\n01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:12,470\neven NTFS system that's built-in\nis starting to show its age.\n\n1470\n01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:16,960\nAnd so it is important from time to\ntime for us to defragment our drives.\n\n1471\n01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,810\nThat's where it reorganizes all\nthe data that's stored in our hard disk\n\n1472\n01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:23,358\nto put it into an optimal range.\n\n1473\n01:09:23,358 --> 01:09:25,690\nNow Windows 8 does this automatically.\n\n1474\n01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:28,936\nIt's already got a schedule built into it,\nit's gonna defragment so\n\n1475\n01:09:28,936 --> 01:09:31,510\nmost of us never even worry about it.\n\n1476\n01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,230\nBut, if you wanna be on the safe side,\n\n1477\n01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:37,270\nif you wanna be sure, we have\nthe defragmentation utility we can use.\n\n1478\n01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:38,920\nBut, Wes you pointed out during the break.\n\n1479\n01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:43,010\n>> Yeah, now we've always known\nthis as disk defragmenter.\n\n1480\n01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,670\nDo you remember the original software,\nwhere they got that?\n\n1481\n01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:48,110\nI mean, we've had that disk\ndefragmenter for a long time.\n\n1482\n01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:51,850\nI think it was originally an executive\nsoftware or something like that.\n\n1483\n01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:52,770\nAnd it's changed.\n\n1484\n01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:55,961\nWhat we've known for many years\nis now called disk optimizer, so\n\n1485\n01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:58,235\nwe're gonna do some\ndisk optimization here.\n\n1486\n01:09:58,235 --> 01:09:59,008\n>> it sounds so much more impressive.\n\n1487\n01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:00,205\n>> It does.\n>> Disk optimizer!\n\n1488\n01:10:00,205 --> 01:10:00,856\n>> Optimizer!\n>> Yeah,\n\n1489\n01:10:00,856 --> 01:10:03,090\nyou almost have to take your fists\nlike this when you say the name.\n\n1490\n01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,590\n>> Yes, rah!\n>> So Wes, do you want to demo that one?\n\n1491\n01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:06,452\n>> Sure we can do that.\n\n1492\n01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:11,360\nAnd now the way I'm gonna get to this,\nif we can show the desktop real quick.\n\n1493\n01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,850\nWe could go to our File Explorer now,\n\n1494\n01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:18,670\nyou know, not Windows Explorer anymore,\nand we can go to our local disk C here.\n\n1495\n01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,260\nRight-click on local disk C.\n\n1496\n01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:24,570\nWe could use Properties, and\nyou will see the Tools tab right here.\n\n1497\n01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:29,210\nAnd, here we go, we've got\nthe Optimize and Defragment Drives.\n\n1498\n01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:31,740\nAnd here we go.\n\n1499\n01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,730\n>> Now,\ndefragmenting a disk can take a long time.\n\n1500\n01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:38,930\nIt's not always necessary.\n\n1501\n01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:42,580\nSometimes your disk is fine, and\nthat's why we have that Analyze button.\n\n1502\n01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,268\nSo Wes,\nwhy don't you go ahead an analyze the C\n\n1503\n01:10:44,268 --> 01:10:44,910\ndrive,\n>> Okay.\n\n1504\n01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:48,080\n>> When you analyze it,\nit's gonna look at the data on there, and\n\n1505\n01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,640\nit's gonna tell you how\nfragmented the disk is.\n\n1506\n01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,395\nIf it's only 5% fragmented,\nit's not gonna tell you to defragment,\n\n1507\n01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:54,532\nit's gonna be fine, right?\n\n1508\n01:10:54,532 --> 01:10:56,348\n[COUGH] So looking at it-\n>> And\n\n1509\n01:10:56,348 --> 01:10:57,002\nthat's what it's saying right there.\n\n1510\n01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,190\n>> Yeah it's 100% efficient.\n\n1511\n01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:01,943\nRight now it is optimized, and\nthat's cuz this is just a lab machine,\n\n1512\n01:11:01,943 --> 01:11:03,590\nit's not doing a lot.\n\n1513\n01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:05,244\nOn your home computer,\nit may be a significantly worse.\n\n1514\n01:11:05,244 --> 01:11:12,160\nI'd use my laptop as an example, but\nSSD doesn't suffer from the same problems.\n\n1515\n01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,060\nFragmentation doesn't actually\nslow down an SSD drive.\n\n1516\n01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,620\nSo on physical disks though\nwhere you've got moving arms,\n\n1517\n01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,520\nfragmentation does slow it down.\n\n1518\n01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,150\nYou can still force it\nto optimize it though.\n\n1519\n01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,500\nWhy don't you do that.\n\n1520\n01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,045\nTake your C drive, or E drive, whatever.\n\n1521\n01:11:25,045 --> 01:11:27,035\nAnd when you optimize it-\n>> Did you see that?\n\n1522\n01:11:27,035 --> 01:11:27,726\n>> Yeah, it was that fast.\n\n1523\n01:11:27,726 --> 01:11:29,291\n>> That was quick.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1524\n01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:29,791\n>> It is an optimizer.\n\n1525\n01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,739\n>> There's not really much to see there.\n\n1526\n01:11:31,739 --> 01:11:32,267\nYou know what?\n\n1527\n01:11:32,267 --> 01:11:35,274\nLet me try on my desktop\n\n1528\n01:11:35,274 --> 01:11:37,810\nhere.\nAnd I'll just pull up, not a virtual\n\n1529\n01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:39,886\nmachine, but my actual desktop.\n>> Sure.\n\n1530\n01:11:39,886 --> 01:11:42,387\n>> So I'm gonna fire up the defrag and,\n\n1531\n01:11:42,387 --> 01:11:44,152\nwhere'd it go?\nIt beeped at me.\n\n1532\n01:11:44,152 --> 01:11:46,890\nWell all right.\n\n1533\n01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,330\nLet's try that again.\n\n1534\n01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:52,280\nSo they may not even support it on SSD.\n\n1535\n01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,210\nLet me go back in here.\n\n1536\n01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,985\nOh, there we go, all right.\n\n1537\n01:11:55,985 --> 01:11:57,829\nSo here it's telling me\nthat my drive is okay.\n\n1538\n01:11:57,829 --> 01:12:01,568\nIt's been 27 days since I have defragged.\n\n1539\n01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:04,204\nNotice how my Analyze\nbutton is grayed out.\n\n1540\n01:12:04,204 --> 01:12:10,050\nAnd that's just because on a SSD,\nit knows that it's an SSD.\n\n1541\n01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:13,450\nThere really isn't a need\nto deal with that.\n\n1542\n01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,938\nIf I take it,\nI can go ahead and optimize it.\n\n1543\n01:12:15,938 --> 01:12:18,380\n>> It might be-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1544\n01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:23,490\n>> To make a real quick comment about\nWindows 8 supports that feature of Trim\n\n1545\n01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:28,470\nthat helps to optimize solid-state just so\nyou prolong the performance really,\n\n1546\n01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:31,570\nnot longevity of the drive, but\nthe performance of the drive, too.\n\n1547\n01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:34,958\nDo wanna mention real quick,\nif we could switch back over to my screen,\n\n1548\n01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:36,548\nthat you can also automate this.\n\n1549\n01:12:36,548 --> 01:12:38,678\nWe can say, and\nit's been automated for a while,\n\n1550\n01:12:38,678 --> 01:12:40,983\nlike Don was mentioning\nwith this defragmentation.\n\n1551\n01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:42,610\n>> How do you get to that screen?\n\n1552\n01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:43,930\n>> Let's show you how you can do that.\n\n1553\n01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:47,200\nRight here we have again\nour Optimize Drives.\n\n1554\n01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,090\nYou've got your Change Settings\nright here below the Analyze and\n\n1555\n01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:53,640\nOptimize settings and\nthen we've got that run schedule on.\n\n1556\n01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,820\nYou can see it weekly, daily and\nwe can set it based on our preferences.\n\n1557\n01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:01,000\nAnd we can also go even farther than that\nand say hey we've gotta series of drives.\n\n1558\n01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,200\nMaybe we don't wanna do the data\nvolume that we've just created.\n\n1559\n01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,700\nMaybe we just wanna make sure that\nour operating system is optimized.\n\n1560\n01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:11,831\nAnd we can schedule it and say,\njust optimize the C: drive.\n\n1561\n01:13:11,831 --> 01:13:13,890\n>> Yep, all right.\n\n1562\n01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,010\nAnd this is a nice little GUI interface.\n\n1563\n01:13:16,010 --> 01:13:19,520\nIf you go into the task scheduler,\nthat's where it's actually putting this.\n\n1564\n01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,670\nAnd so\nyou can see the stuff in there too, and\n\n1565\n01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:25,040\nadjust it that way is a little bit harder,\nthis is the easier way to go about it, so.\n\n1566\n01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,760\n>> I'll just show you where you guys,\nreal quick,\n\n1567\n01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,890\nwhere you can find that task\nscheduler that Don's mentioning.\n\n1568\n01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:33,730\nIf you go to your computer\nmanagement options and\n\n1569\n01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,120\nI'm doing this a little bit quick guys so\nI'm going to the Control Panel.\n\n1570\n01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,330\nI'm gonna go to Systems and Security,\ngonna scroll down to Administrative Tools.\n\n1571\n01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:45,500\nAnd you see also, Defragment and Optimize\nDrives there as well but you can go in\n\n1572\n01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,930\nhere to Computer Management, and here's\nthe Task Scheduler that he was saying.\n\n1573\n01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:50,840\nAnd you can go in here and\n\n1574\n01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,440\nyou can see that it, when we do\nmodify that entry on Disk Optimizer.\n\n1575\n01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,140\nThat's what it's doing.\n\n1576\n01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,630\nIt's modifying an entry within\nthe Task Scheduler here.\n\n1577\n01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:59,650\n>> Yep.\n\n1578\n01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:02,490\nAll right so\nas far as disk Defragmentation.\n\n1579\n01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:03,270\nThere's not much to it.\n\n1580\n01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:04,720\nIt does automatically happen.\n\n1581\n01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,170\nJust be aware that it is there.\n\n1582\n01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,870\nI don't believe there's\na command line utility anymore.\n\n1583\n01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,230\nI think they killed that off in\nWindows 7 if I remember right.\n\n1584\n01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:15,130\nLet me just check.\n\n1585\n01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,090\nI'm a big fat liar.\n\n1586\n01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:18,320\nSo there it is,\nwe got a command line utility.\n\n1587\n01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,030\nSo they had talked about\nkilling it off at one point.\n\n1588\n01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:22,530\nI guess they didn't.\n\n1589\n01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:25,950\nSo you do have a command line utility for\nit which is defrag and\n\n1590\n01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:31,780\nyou can see you really just specify the\nvolume defrag C: defrag E: and let it run.\n\n1591\n01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:34,010\nSo again another utility\nthat we can automate.\n\n1592\n01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:37,315\n>> And one that's also been in Windows for\na very long time and\n\n1593\n01:14:37,315 --> 01:14:40,980\nthey were actually thinking about taking\nit out of Windows 8 was check disk.\n\n1594\n01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:45,455\nCheck disk is a utility that we\ncan run across our hard drive and\n\n1595\n01:14:45,455 --> 01:14:51,220\nwe can manage the integrity of\nthe file system on our storage medium.\n\n1596\n01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,521\nThey said that they were\nthinking about taking it out,\n\n1597\n01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:56,736\nbut I guess there was enough of the IT\nuproar, it's like don't take it out.\n\n1598\n01:14:56,736 --> 01:14:58,591\nWe need that.\nIt's been there forever and it works, so\n\n1599\n01:14:58,591 --> 01:15:01,720\nthey did keep it in there so you can also\nrun a check disk command on it and, again,\n\n1600\n01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,068\nit will just scan the logical\nintegrity of the file system and\n\n1601\n01:15:04,068 --> 01:15:05,480\nmake sure that there's no errors.\n\n1602\n01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,095\n>> Yeah, awesome.\n\n1603\n01:15:06,095 --> 01:15:10,590\nAnd that does happen any time your\nmachine is improperly shut down,\n\n1604\n01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,930\nCheck Disk runs, all that good stuff.\n\n1605\n01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:14,964\nAll these utilities, Defrag, Check Disk,\n\n1606\n01:15:14,964 --> 01:15:17,326\nwe cover them in a lot of of\ndepth over in the A+ show.\n\n1607\n01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:19,744\nMost of you guys have already\nseen that content, but for\n\n1608\n01:15:19,744 --> 01:15:23,304\nthe Windows 8 exam they are there, they do\nshow up, so we need to be aware of them.\n\n1609\n01:15:23,304 --> 01:15:24,620\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n1610\n01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,394\n>> All right.\nI'm gonna steal that\n\n1611\n01:15:25,394 --> 01:15:25,959\nlast machine from you.\n\n1612\n01:15:25,959 --> 01:15:27,500\n>> Okay, go ahead.\n\n1613\n01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,270\nWe're gonna.\n\n1614\n01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:33,121\n>> And what I want to do is I want to show\nyou guys the feature that we have here for\n\n1615\n01:15:33,121 --> 01:15:36,130\nour objectives today\nwhich is storage space.\n\n1616\n01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,930\n>> This is really really cool technology.\n\n1617\n01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:40,870\n>> Storage spaces are actually\na technology that evolved from\n\n1618\n01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,985\nthe Windows Home Server and they actually\nremoved it from Windows Home Server, and\n\n1619\n01:15:44,985 --> 01:15:48,216\nthen they stuck it into Windows 8,\nalthough in a modified form,\n\n1620\n01:15:48,216 --> 01:15:50,840\nso it's not actually\ncompatible with the old one.\n\n1621\n01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,680\nBut what storage spaces allows you to\ndo is to create a specialized type\n\n1622\n01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,850\nof location for your data,\nlike a partition, right?\n\n1623\n01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:01,670\nThat can be spanned across\nmultiple drives, so that,\n\n1624\n01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:02,560\nthis sounds familiar right?\n\n1625\n01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> But that also provides redundancy.\n\n1626\n01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,800\nYou can add drives to it, and\nremove drives from it at will, and\n\n1627\n01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800\nit provides redundancy.\n\n1628\n01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,390\nIt can rebuild the data, and so\nit gives us the best of both worlds.\n\n1629\n01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:18,480\nWe can have different size disks that\nwe build a storage space across.\n\n1630\n01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,926\nAnd it will be perfectly happy with that\nand if I run out of space I just throw\n\n1631\n01:16:22,926 --> 01:16:26,180\nanother hard drive on and\nit grows to fill that space.\n\n1632\n01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:28,886\nIf I want to take a hard\ndrive out I can remove it and\n\n1633\n01:16:28,886 --> 01:16:31,404\nit shrinks to go back to\nthe space that it has.\n\n1634\n01:16:31,404 --> 01:16:35,385\nVery very cool stuff built into Windows 8.\n\n1635\n01:16:35,385 --> 01:16:36,122\n>> Yep.\n\n1636\n01:16:36,122 --> 01:16:39,486\nAnd another benefit to that is when we\nlook at drive interfaces, we usually,\n\n1637\n01:16:39,486 --> 01:16:41,865\ntypically say, okay,\nif you got a SATA based system,\n\n1638\n01:16:41,865 --> 01:16:43,790\nyou're gonna be using SATA interface.\n\n1639\n01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:46,720\nYou're not gonna mix and match, and\nthat's one of the cool things about\n\n1640\n01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,960\nstorage space is it really doesn't\nmatter what drive interface.\n\n1641\n01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,720\nYou can create one of these storage spaces\nor storage pools out of different drive\n\n1642\n01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:57,710\ninterfaces and\nthat could be beneficial to the end user.\n\n1643\n01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:59,640\n>> And you know what, I completely forgot,\n\n1644\n01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,550\nwhen we went on break remember I mentioned\nwhy the heck isn't RAID 5 working?\n\n1645\n01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:08,140\nSo we looked it up and the RAID 5\nsupport is actually not in Windows 8,\n\n1646\n01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,020\nWindows 8 doesn't support RAID 5,\n\n1647\n01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:13,580\nbut apparently they were too\nlazy to take out the menu item.\n\n1648\n01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,710\nFor some reason,\nthey left the menu item in there.\n\n1649\n01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:19,940\nSo Windows 8 does not support RAID 5\neven though the menu item is there.\n\n1650\n01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:23,420\nThat's why I couldn't get it\nto un-gray before the break.\n\n1651\n01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:27,120\n>> Yep.\nWhen you create a storage space, too, we\n\n1652\n01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,640\ntalked about that redundancy, making sure\nthat the data's integrity is maintained.\n\n1653\n01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,620\nWindows will lock itself out,\nbelieve it or not, it's kinda funny.\n\n1654\n01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:38,490\nIt will lock itself out of the ability for\nthe operating system to\n\n1655\n01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:41,500\nwrite to those drives just so\nwe don't have errors or inconsistencies.\n\n1656\n01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:45,560\nSo it really does, the entire\nstorage space or collection pool,\n\n1657\n01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,650\nif you will, becomes protected.\n\n1658\n01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:50,810\nIt's kind of funny,\nWindows protects it from itself.\n\n1659\n01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1660\n01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,390\n>> Somebody's got to.\n\n1661\n01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,810\n>> Yes.\n>> All right, so\n\n1662\n01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,210\nlet's configure some storage spaces.\n\n1663\n01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,740\nI'm gonna fire up my modern UI and\n\n1664\n01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,250\nI'm just gonna type storage spaces and\nthere it is.\n\n1665\n01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:06,800\nAnd so when I go into storage spaces,\nit's got a nice GUI for managing it.\n\n1666\n01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,360\nI don't have any storage spaces right\nnow so it's offering to create one.\n\n1667\n01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,810\nSo I'm going to create a pool and\n\n1668\n01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:17,150\nwhen I do, it's gonna show me\nthe available disks that I have.\n\n1669\n01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:21,653\nNow, these disks need to not have\ndata on them, cuz in order to build\n\n1670\n01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:25,931\nthe storage space, it's got to\nformat them and get them ready.\n\n1671\n01:18:25,931 --> 01:18:28,600\nSo, it's got these drives that\nI've got available, the three.\n\n1672\n01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,920\nNow my three drives are identically sized.\n\n1673\n01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,330\nThey don't have to be, right?\n\n1674\n01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:35,970\nYou can have different sizes,\ndifferent vendors, it doesn't matter,\n\n1675\n01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:41,540\nbecause the way it does redundancy\nis it stores all of your data twice.\n\n1676\n01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:44,440\nAnd it spreads it across the drives,\nnot in stripes but\n\n1677\n01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,060\njust by storing the files twice.\n\n1678\n01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:49,520\nSo you can have completely\ndifferent drives and that's fine.\n\n1679\n01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,030\nSomewhere on those drives, your data will\nbe stored in two different locations.\n\n1680\n01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:55,500\nSo I'm gonna let it take, you know what,\n\n1681\n01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,722\nI'm actually going to do two disks for\nnow.\n\n1682\n01:18:57,722 --> 01:18:59,840\nSo that we can add one\nin here in a minute.\n\n1683\n01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,750\nSo I'll just two, they're 127 gigs each,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n1684\n01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,380\ncreate that pool.\n\n1685\n01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:10,425\nSo it's gonna get created and at the end\nof the day I'm not gonna have 254\n\n1686\n01:19:10,425 --> 01:19:15,731\ngigs of space because some of that's\ngonna have to be eaten up for redundancy.\n\n1687\n01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:18,715\n>> You guys might have caught it in\nthe background there, the GUI for\n\n1688\n01:19:18,715 --> 01:19:21,915\ndisk management was going crazy in\nthe background [LAUGH] there while it\n\n1689\n01:19:21,915 --> 01:19:23,613\nwas creating those storage spaces.\n\n1690\n01:19:23,613 --> 01:19:26,006\nYou could see icons appearing and\ndisappearing.\n\n1691\n01:19:26,006 --> 01:19:27,970\n>> And\nlook at these resiliency options here.\n\n1692\n01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:29,330\nThis is the redundancy.\n\n1693\n01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:32,770\nI can choose simple, which basically\ndoes make it a spanned volume, so\n\n1694\n01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:34,830\nthere's not a lot of\nreason to choose that.\n\n1695\n01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:40,310\nWe can do a two way mirror, that way all\nof your data is stored in two places.\n\n1696\n01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:41,020\nAll right?\n\n1697\n01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,990\nWe can do a three way mirror,\nwhere your data is stored in three places.\n\n1698\n01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:48,449\nAnd we can do parity which would be in\neffect like what we have with RAID 5.\n\n1699\n01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:49,282\n>> With the RAID 5, yep.\n\n1700\n01:19:49,282 --> 01:19:51,728\n>> Yep, so\nwe've got a couple of choices there,\n\n1701\n01:19:51,728 --> 01:19:55,178\nit is warning me down here a two way\nmirror writes two copies of your\n\n1702\n01:19:55,178 --> 01:19:58,218\ndata helping to protect you\nfrom a single drive failure.\n\n1703\n01:19:58,218 --> 01:20:01,642\nA two way mirror storage base\nrequires at least two drives, right?\n\n1704\n01:20:01,642 --> 01:20:03,159\nSo it is giving me that warning.\n\n1705\n01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:05,281\nAnd it'll say the same thing\nif I choose the other ones.\n\n1706\n01:20:05,281 --> 01:20:06,740\nLike if I choose parity.\n\n1707\n01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:09,170\nParity requires at least three drives.\n\n1708\n01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,120\nSo I've only got two drives in right now.\n\n1709\n01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,760\nSo I'm just gonna do a two way mirror.\n\n1710\n01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,900\nAnd so at the end of the day I'm\nonly gonna have 125 gigs of storage.\n\n1711\n01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,040\nCuz my data's gotta be stored twice.\n\n1712\n01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,400\nSo I'll go ahead and create that.\n\n1713\n01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,850\nAnd it's gonna whip it up,\n\n1714\n01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:25,480\nand I've effectively created\na mirror at this point.\n\n1715\n01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,540\nAnything I write to the first drive,\nwill be stored on the second drive.\n\n1716\n01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:31,430\nIf one drive fails, I've got that backup.\n\n1717\n01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:34,170\n>> Yeah.\nAnd from a perspective of cost,\n\n1718\n01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:38,790\nkeep in mind that if anything that's\ngonna give you redundancy or resiliency,\n\n1719\n01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:39,580\nit's gonna cost.\n\n1720\n01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:40,140\nIt's and added expense.\n\n1721\n01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:42,840\nIf you're losing half\nof your data storage.\n\n1722\n01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,180\nSo if you need more, if you need that same\namount you really have to double the drive\n\n1723\n01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,080\nthat you have in the system.\n\n1724\n01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:53,260\nSo it's going to cost a little extra money\nto get that resilience or redundancy.\n\n1725\n01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,520\n>> Now let me jump back to the disk\nmanagement in the background here.\n\n1726\n01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,740\nLook at what happened.\n\n1727\n01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,385\nI used to have four disks.\n\n1728\n01:20:59,385 --> 01:21:01,555\nDisk zero was where my OS was.\n\n1729\n01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:06,010\nDisk one and two, and three were\nthose three drives that I'd added.\n\n1730\n01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:09,760\nOne and two disappeared,\nand now I have disk four.\n\n1731\n01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,380\nStorage spaces actually\nhides the underlying disk.\n\n1732\n01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,805\nSo our OS doesn't see\nthose underlying disk.\n\n1733\n01:21:15,805 --> 01:21:19,250\nDisk one and two are now invisible,\nthey have become disk four.\n\n1734\n01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:22,710\nWhich I see is only a 125 gig,\nyou lose little space,\n\n1735\n01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:27,584\nthere's basically a 127 gig disk, because\nwe are mirroring between the two drives.\n\n1736\n01:21:27,584 --> 01:21:28,920\n>> Yeah.\n\n1737\n01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,520\n>> As I start to copy data to that it's\njust automatic that it's going to be\n\n1738\n01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,750\nmirroring that data.\n\n1739\n01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:37,890\nAnd let me see if I can find some\nkind of file that I can copy over.\n\n1740\n01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:39,180\nNothing too gigantic.\n\n1741\n01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:45,730\nMaybe a couple of megs here,\nthis explorer.exe.\n\n1742\n01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:47,190\nWe can copy that over.\n\n1743\n01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:49,950\nAnd so when I copy it,\nI just see it copying once.\n\n1744\n01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:51,290\nI don't even think about it.\n\n1745\n01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:52,580\nThere it is, it copied.\n\n1746\n01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:56,600\nBut it actually copied it twice, to two\ndifferent locations on those drives.\n\n1747\n01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,980\nThat data gets stored,\nand it's happy, all right.\n\n1748\n01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:03,090\nThe cool part, though, is if I go\nback to my Storage Spaces screen,\n\n1749\n01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,720\nthere's my Storage pool I can Add Drives.\n\n1750\n01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,830\nAs I start to run low on space,\nI can just stick a drive on it.\n\n1751\n01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:13,350\nA mirror by definition, is two disks.\n\n1752\n01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:15,580\nYou can't add drives to a mirror.\n\n1753\n01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,960\nBut this is not a normal mirror.\n\n1754\n01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,380\nIt's just storing data in two places.\n\n1755\n01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,860\nIt doesn't care necessarily where.\n\n1756\n01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,350\nSo I can add in that third drive.\n\n1757\n01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:28,420\nAnd when I do it it's\nadding an extra 127 gigs.\n\n1758\n01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:32,350\nAnd so when it's done,\nnow I've got three drives in there.\n\n1759\n01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:35,610\nAnd I can look down here and\nI see I've got a two way mirror.\n\n1760\n01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:40,020\nNotice how it still says,\nI have 125 gigs of storage.\n\n1761\n01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,650\nAnd back here it still shows as 125 gigs.\n\n1762\n01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:46,510\nAnd that's because it's now gonna start\nspreading across that other disk.\n\n1763\n01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:49,690\nAnd we can change the way\nthat it's laying out.\n\n1764\n01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:52,250\nSo I'll go here to change, and\n\n1765\n01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,770\nwe can change the way that it's\ndoing the size and all that.\n\n1766\n01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:56,390\nSo here,\n\n1767\n01:22:56,390 --> 01:23:00,620\nI've got my storage space, and actually\nI'm already at my maximum, aren't I?\n\n1768\n01:23:01,655 --> 01:23:05,580\nOh, to change it,\nit's gonna be a pain, isn't it?\n\n1769\n01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:10,610\nSo at this point, the way that it's\nset it is basically handling where if\n\n1770\n01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:13,120\none drive fails, the other one's\ngonna kick in as that mirror.\n\n1771\n01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,940\nIt's almost like a hot spare.\n\n1772\n01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:20,918\nSo if I wanna convert it,\nnow I gotta remember how to convert it.\n\n1773\n01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:26,589\nIf I want to convert it, if I'm going to\nrecreate a new pool which could be a mess.\n\n1774\n01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:27,199\n>> Delete the pool.\n\n1775\n01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,100\nYeah.\n>> Yeah, I don't want to delete the pool.\n\n1776\n01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:33,100\nBut you can throw that extra drive and now\nif I have a drive failure it will recover.\n\n1777\n01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:36,480\nSo that's good, but\nI still see it as 127 gigs.\n\n1778\n01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,590\nThere is a way to convert it over to\nparity after it's already been a mirror.\n\n1779\n01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,750\nI just don't recall it.\n\n1780\n01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:45,580\nSo an easier solution would be\njust to toast it and rebuild it.\n\n1781\n01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:46,678\nSo let's do that.\n\n1782\n01:23:46,678 --> 01:23:54,930\nLet's rebuild it and so-\n>> Technology.\n\n1783\n01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:57,264\n>> Yep.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1784\n01:23:57,264 --> 01:24:00,313\n>> Oh, I got to do my change settings,\n\n1785\n01:24:00,313 --> 01:24:01,440\nthere we go.\n\n1786\n01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,240\nAll right, so\nI'm just gonna delete that pool.\n\n1787\n01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:07,850\nAnd I could backup my data here,\n\n1788\n01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:11,120\nback up to wherever,\ncreate a new storage space and restore it.\n\n1789\n01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,810\nAnd then we'd have all our data in place.\n\n1790\n01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:16,120\nSo this time I'm gonna choose to do\nparity cuz I've got three drives.\n\n1791\n01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,370\nAnd see how I'm gonna end up\nwith 251 gigs of storage.\n\n1792\n01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:21,880\nI'll have two full drives\nworth of storage and\n\n1793\n01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,980\nthe third drive is gonna\nget eaten up by parity.\n\n1794\n01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,000\nSo I'll go ahead and create that.\n\n1795\n01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,140\nAnd now I effectively have RAID 5, right?\n\n1796\n01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:34,590\nBut I can continue to add drives\nto this as my environment grows.\n\n1797\n01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:37,670\nBut it is redundant, so\nthere we get that benefit.\n\n1798\n01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:42,260\nSo if you think, man it stinks they\ntook RAID 5 support out of Windows 8.\n\n1799\n01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:45,780\nWell it's actually fine, because instead\nof that you can just do a storage base and\n\n1800\n01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,332\nyou get the same benefits of RAID 5.\n\n1801\n01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n1802\n01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:51,440\n>> So\nit's taking its time formatting isn't it?\n\n1803\n01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,310\n>> And disk management in the background\nis just absolutely just excited\n\n1804\n01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:56,670\nthat all this is going on.\n\n1805\n01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:58,530\n>> Yeah.\n>> So what are you doing to me here?\n\n1806\n01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:02,380\n>> It's funny when you go back to like\ndisk management you'll see here where\n\n1807\n01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,900\njust one two and three are gone.\n\n1808\n01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,640\nThere's disk four which is\nshowing up as 250 gigs.\n\n1809\n01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,550\nBut if I look up here, see all these\ndifferent layouts and whatever.\n\n1810\n01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,700\nThese are drives with no name.\n\n1811\n01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,000\nAnd that's because some of\nthese are part a boot but\n\n1812\n01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,590\nsome of it's part of the storage space.\n\n1813\n01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:20,340\nAnd so\nyou see a bunch of weird things up there.\n\n1814\n01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:22,960\nSo it's formatting these raw\npartitions and it'll take-\n\n1815\n01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,610\n>> And some of them aren't even accessible\n\n1816\n01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:27,230\nbecause they're used for\nthe extensible firmware interface you see.\n\n1817\n01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:28,850\nSo we, they're protected.\n\n1818\n01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:29,740\n>> Yep.\n\n1819\n01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,700\nBut now it's done.\n\n1820\n01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:32,020\nI've got an E drive and\n\n1821\n01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:35,260\nwhen I start throwing data in there\nit's gonna calculate parity out on that.\n\n1822\n01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,350\nAnd I get that redundancy and\nI get that flexibility.\n\n1823\n01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:40,940\nSo it is still done in software.\n\n1824\n01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:44,880\nSo not necessarily ideal as\ndoing things in hardware.\n\n1825\n01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,710\nAnd hardware is gonna do it much faster,\nand much more efficiently.\n\n1826\n01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:51,730\nBut if you don't have the resources\navailable for that, we can do this in\n\n1827\n01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:55,490\nsoftware, it's independent of our hard\ndrive type, our hard drive sizes.\n\n1828\n01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:57,690\nIf you're doing RAID 5\non a normal controller,\n\n1829\n01:25:57,690 --> 01:26:00,020\nyou'd wanna have all your\ndrives as the same size.\n\n1830\n01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:00,860\nHere they don't have to be.\n\n1831\n01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:01,780\n>> Yep.\n\n1832\n01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,476\n>> So really cool stuff.\n\n1833\n01:26:03,476 --> 01:26:05,301\n>> Very flexible too.\n\n1834\n01:26:05,301 --> 01:26:09,960\nJust the fact that you can use all the\ndifferent drive types or interface types.\n\n1835\n01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,640\nIt doesn't have to be the same size and\n\n1836\n01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:15,134\nyou can still almost feel well we can\npretty much create like a great RAID 5 or\n\n1837\n01:26:15,134 --> 01:26:18,765\nRAID out of just\ncompletely a box of parts.\n\n1838\n01:26:18,765 --> 01:26:19,995\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> As long as they work.\n\n1839\n01:26:19,995 --> 01:26:21,592\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n1840\n01:26:21,592 --> 01:26:24,470\nthat's really all I can think\nof on storage's spaces.\n\n1841\n01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:25,710\nCan you think of anything\nelse to throw in?\n\n1842\n01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:26,880\n>> No, no, I got nothing.\n\n1843\n01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,580\n>> Nope.\n\n1844\n01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,420\nAll right, well, let's wrap it up there.\n\n1845\n01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:33,070\nThat is our last objective on\nthis one was storage spaces.\n\n1846\n01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:35,420\nSo we tackled a lot today, let's recap.\n\n1847\n01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,280\nNo we're all the Windows Update settings.\n\n1848\n01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,891\nIt's important to remember those for\n\n1849\n01:26:38,891 --> 01:26:40,950\nthe exam Windows Updates,\nit's important anyway.\n\n1850\n01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,890\nYou need to keep your\nsystem up to date and\n\n1851\n01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:44,850\nyou can manage it from\na centralized policy.\n\n1852\n01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:48,410\nOn our storage side we got to\nsee creating partitions and\n\n1853\n01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:51,630\nvolumes from the GUI,\nas well as from the command prompt.\n\n1854\n01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:55,100\nAnd we got to take a look at\ndefragmentation and storage spaces.\n\n1855\n01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,790\nNow we still have more\nto go in this objective.\n\n1856\n01:26:57,790 --> 01:27:02,450\nWe've got all the hard stuff,\nevent logs, and all that.\n\n1857\n01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,130\nBut we are out of time for

everybody.\n\n5\n00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,280\nWelcome back to part two\nof Maintaining Windows.\n\n6\n00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,970\nMy name's Mike.\n\n7\n00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,600\nHere with my buddy Nate.\n\n8\n00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,270\n>> How you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,218\n>> And we got some really\ncool stuff to go over today.\n\n10\n00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:47,860\nWe are gonna take a look at\nthings like performance monitor,\n\n11\n00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,870\nand event collectors, and\nour event log system.\n\n12\n00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,420\nA lot of really cool stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,610\nGot a good show for you,\nhope you guys enjoy.\n\n14\n00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,530\nYeah, task manager.\n\n15\n00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,670\n>> Task manager,\nyou didn’t mention that one.\n\n16\n00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,440\n>> Task manager completely changed for\nWindows 8.\n\n17\n00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,150\nSome really neat stuff in there.\n\n18\n00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,262\nI mean it’s awesome.\n\n19\n00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:13,070\nAnd yeah, task manager’s little\ncompanion app I guess resource.\n\n20\n00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,190\n>> Resource monitor, yeah.\n\n21\n00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,410\n>> I would say maybe\nresource monitor is almost\n\n22\n00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,580\nnot needed maybe in some\ncases because task manager.\n\n23\n00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,880\n>> Task manager is really cool.\n\n24\n00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,660\nThey've made some big changes to it.\n\n25\n00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,350\nA lot more information and if that wasn't\nenough, you get into resource monitor and\n\n26\n00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,230\nyou're very much overwhelmed with\nall the information you're getting.\n\n27\n00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,810\nMicrosoft listened to us, right?\n\n28\n00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,060\nStop hiding information.\n\n29\n00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,060\nStop making it so difficult to find\nout what the heck is going on.\n\n30\n00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,130\nAll right, here you go, here's everything.\n\n31\n00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,340\nSo really cool stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,530\nA little bit lighter stuff today.\n\n33\n00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,870\nKind of some fun stuff in my opinion,\nI don't know.\n\n34\n00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,780\nI geek out on this computer stuff but\nI like this kind of thing.\n\n35\n00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,330\nIt's a little bit lighter on the brain.\n\n36\n00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,020\nNot so much memorization like we were\ntalking about in some of our other\n\n37\n00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,590\nepisodes where you've got to memorize all\nthese facts and stuff, this is fun stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,415\nAnd it's stuff that you guys can\ndo on your home computer right?\n\n39\n00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:01,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I mean if you're running Windows 8 at\n\n40\n00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,700\nyour house you can see\nall of this right there.\n\n41\n00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,675\nSo you can practice it,\nyou can really learn it well, so.\n\n42\n00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:07,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n43\n00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,920\n>> Good, good stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,480\nSo what do you say?\n\n45\n00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,980\nWhat do you wanna start with today,\nMr. Nate?\n\n46\n00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,260\n>> Maybe event logs?\n\n47\n00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,170\n>> Event logs sounds like\na great place to start.\n\n48\n00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,190\nI like it.\n\n49\n00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,770\n>> If you have a event logs right,\n\n50\n00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,440\nwhere stuff that your computer\ndoes gets logged to events.\n\n51\n00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,620\nNow we did touch on event logs earlier\nin some of the early stuff with\n\n52\n00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,120\nsuccess and failure auditing, you saw\na little bit with those event logs.\n\n53\n00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,090\n>> Pop quiz.\n\n54\n00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,110\nWhat log system does your\nauditing events go to?\n\n55\n00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,780\n>> The audit one!\n\n56\n00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,930\n>> The security log!\n\n57\n00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,000\nYou guys knew that, right?\n\n58\n00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,740\nAll right, just double checking.\n\n59\n00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,120\nMaking sure you guys are paying\nattention out there.\n\n60\n00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,600\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yap, so we'll dive back into event\n\n61\n00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,210\nviewer and create some custom views,\nwe'll save those,\n\n62\n00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,470\nwe can come back later if we need\nit to do something with them?\n\n63\n00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,050\n>> What a sweet concept that is.\n\n64\n00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,600\nWhere has that been all my life?\n\n65\n00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,840\n[LAUGH] I'm telling you, guys.\n\n66\n00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880\nIt sounds silly.\n\n67\n00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,470\nIt sound like, who cares, right?\n\n68\n00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,140\nBut when your job is to go in there and\nlook at those log files, and\n\n69\n00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,540\nlog files can get huge, and\nI have to be able to filter it down.\n\n70\n00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,230\nWell, let's look at it.\n\n71\n00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,330\nWe'll talk about it and\nwe'll look at it but\n\n72\n00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,160\nwhen you go to filter that log down\nto find the pertinent information.\n\n73\n00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,210\nAnd if I have to do that every time,\nwhat a pain in the butt.\n\n74\n00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,620\nBut now I can create these custom filters,\nthese custom views, and I can save them.\n\n75\n00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,190\nI can even take em from one machine and\n\n76\n00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,660\nbring em to another machine, so\nI don't have to do it over and over again.\n\n77\n00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,700\nIt's fantastic.\n\n78\n00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,895\nLove it.\nThank you, Microsoft.\n\n79\n00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n80\n00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,210\nSo, Mike.\n\n81\n00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,510\n>> Yeah.\n\n82\n00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,259\n>> Isn't this what you\ndo on Friday nights?\n\n83\n00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,690\nDon't you just go through and look at\nreliability history and read event logs.\n\n84\n00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,600\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n85\n00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,950\nWhat are you trying to say, man?\n\n86\n00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,588\n>> Oh, no, no, nothing.\n\n87\n00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,180\n>> Yeah,\nmy social life is not the greatest.\n\n88\n00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,851\n>> Uh-huh, man.\n\n89\n00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,990\n>> I spend a lot of it on the computer.\n\n90\n00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,070\nSetting up networks,\nand trying to do a tax.\n\n91\n00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,750\nYeah, looking at log files.\n\n92\n00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,090\n>> Well, and that's why you're so\n\n93\n00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,930\nsuccessful at Windows 8 computing,\nin your sleep.\n\n94\n00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,884\nThat's why I'm glad that you're\nhere because [CROSSTALK]\n\n95\n00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:20,623\n>> Yeah!\n\n96\n00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:21,550\n>> It is true, guys.\n\n97\n00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,530\nI mean, the best way to learn this stuff\nis to get in there and play with it.\n\n98\n00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,800\nI mean, you could read about it,\nyou can watch our episodes,\n\n99\n00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,130\nwhich you definitely should do.\n\n100\n00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,850\nBut you've got to get in there and\nplay with it.\n\n101\n00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,730\nYou just have to.\n\n102\n00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,073\nGotta get in there and try it out.\n\n103\n00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,000\nSo [LAUGH] yeah.\n\n104\n00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,820\nSo let's do it.\n\n105\n00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,270\nWhat do you want to, which machine shall\nwe show this event viewer system on?\n\n106\n00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,060\nDo you wanna get into one of our VMs or?\n\n107\n00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,690\nSince eventually, we're gonna be doing\nsome, why don't we go ahead and start on,\n\n108\n00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,040\nabout about DC1?\n\n109\n00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz, eventually we're gonna\n\n110\n00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,518\nprobably use him to do our\nevent collectors anyway, so.\n\n111\n00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:57,120\nDo you wanna go and\nget remoted into him, and\n\n112\n00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,975\nthat way we can save some time,\nsave some steps there.\n\n113\n00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:01,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n114\n00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,940\n>> So Nate is going to remote\ninto one of our test machines for\n\n115\n00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,920\nour ITProTV lab, and he's gonna get into,\nI believe, Mr. DC 1 here.\n\n116\n00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,870\nAnd it wouldn't matter.\n\n117\n00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,000\nThis is gonna be a 2012 server, but the\nevent log system from server to Windows\n\n118\n00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,250\n8 is the same, so it really doesn't matter\nwhat operating system you're looking at.\n\n119\n00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,550\nThe number of logs is going to be\ndifferent on your domain controllers and\n\n120\n00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,930\non your servers.\n\n121\n00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,940\nBut for the most part, what we're\ngonna do, what we need to know for\n\n122\n00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,290\nthis Windows 8 class it doesn't matter.\n\n123\n00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,490\nAnd we will definitely take a look\nat a Windows 8 machine as well,\n\n124\n00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,520\nabout middle of our next episode or\nsomething.\n\n125\n00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,070\nOur next segment.\n\n126\n00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,760\nSo there you go.\n\n127\n00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,530\nBeautiful.\n\n128\n00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,400\nYeah, let me jump out of\nthis thing real quick and\n\n129\n00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,850\nredo it briefly so\nI can change the resolution on it.\n\n130\n00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,680\n>> Well that's looking a little small for\nmy old eyes.\n\n131\n00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n132\n00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,740\nOh pop quiz.\n\n133\n00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,040\n>> Yes.\n>> Can I change the resolution from inside\n\n134\n00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,070\na remote desktop session?\n\n135\n00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,078\n>> No.\nNo, you may not.\n\n136\n00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:02,885\n>> All right.\n\n137\n00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:08,961\n[LAUGH] Thought you were gonna stump me,\ndidn't you?\n\n138\n00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n139\n00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,420\n>> That was a guess.\n\n140\n00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,920\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n141\n00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,350\n>> I figured since you were getting out of\n\n142\n00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,550\nit to change the resolution,\n\n143\n00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,170\nthere's a good chance that you cannot\ndo it from inside that remote session.\n\n144\n00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,020\nBut you can not,\nwhen you're in a remote session,\n\n145\n00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,198\nright click on the desktop you\ncan't change the resolution there.\n\n146\n00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,510\n>> Yeah, give me here just a minute.\n\n147\n00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,780\nSo we'll get logged back in there,\nmake it a little bit bigger so\n\n148\n00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,790\nthat you guys at home can see what we're\ndoing and why we're waiting there.\n\n149\n00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,915\nDon't forget you can check us out on,\nwell, you guys are probably already on,\n\n150\n00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:36,590\nitpro.tv, also we've got that\nnew roku channel set up.\n\n151\n00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,900\nSo, make sure if you've got one of\nthose fancy dancy roku devices,\n\n152\n00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,670\ncheck us out on there.\n\n153\n00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,390\nWe've got our channel set up.\n\n154\n00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,070\nAnd good to go.\n\n155\n00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,230\nAll right?\n\n156\n00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,400\nSo he's getting logged back in to Mr.\nDC here.\n\n157\n00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,090\nAnd we'll take a look at the event log and\nas Nate was pointing out earlier,\n\n158\n00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,460\nthe event log this is a logging system\nwhere my computer can record events so\n\n159\n00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,900\nwhen something happens it records events.\n\n160\n00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,800\nWe've got three main log files\nin our operating system.\n\n161\n00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,490\nWe've got our system log where the system\ncan register events like shutting down,\n\n162\n00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,620\nstarting up, services starting up,\nthings like that.\n\n163\n00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,260\nWe have our application log where\napplications can register their events\n\n164\n00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,940\nlike their starting up or they've had\na problem or whatever the case may be.\n\n165\n00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,610\nAnd then we've got our security log which\nis where all of our auditing events go.\n\n166\n00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,270\nSo when we talked about our auditing\nepisode and we enabled auditing and\n\n167\n00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,980\ndifferent things like log on,\nI think we did and a couple others.\n\n168\n00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,480\nThose are all going to go\nunder your security log.\n\n169\n00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,440\nThose are your main three logs.\n\n170\n00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,120\nNow we also have a slew of other logs now,\nthank you Microsoft for\n\n171\n00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,700\nthose, that are service specific and\nthings like that.\n\n172\n00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,780\nDown under Applications and Services,\nwhich if Nate can remember how to get\n\n173\n00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,670\ninto that Event Viewer,\nhe's thinking about it.\n\n174\n00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,860\n>> All right.\n>> Back in there?\n\n175\n00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,610\nWoohoo.\n\n176\n00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,110\n>> Yep.\nI'm just gonna stay logged in\n\n177\n00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,160\nto the VM host rather than\nremoting back into it.\n\n178\n00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,728\n>> Okay.\nVery good.\n\n179\n00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,233\nVery good.\n\n180\n00:07:59,233 --> 00:07:59,976\n>> All right.\n\n181\n00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:04,405\nYeah, we're here and I believe,\nto get into event viewer.\n\n182\n00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:05,752\nLet me just.\n>> As long as you can spell,\n\n183\n00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,882\nyou can find it, right,\nwith Windows 8 and 2012.\n\n184\n00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,860\nI mean that is the nice thing\nabout that start screen.\n\n185\n00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,630\nSo he just typed Event Viewer and\nviola, there it is.\n\n186\n00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,160\nThere it is.\nSo, go ahead and\n\n187\n00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,945\nexpand out for us,\nthe Windows logs over there.\n\n188\n00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:23,582\nThat's where, like I said,\nyou get the main logs,\n\n189\n00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:27,710\nyou've got your application log,\nwhere your application can record events.\n\n190\n00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,210\nYou've got your security log,\nfor your auditing events.\n\n191\n00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,300\nThen you've got your system log,\nfor your system events.\n\n192\n00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,770\nAnd then the setup log, obviously,\nis for when you install Windows and\n\n193\n00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,770\nwhen you install some applications,\nthey can record events there.\n\n194\n00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,540\nBut the other three are your main three.\n\n195\n00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,100\nAnd if we go back to,\nI don't know, application?\n\n196\n00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,365\nWe've probably got some\ndifferent types of events there.\n\n197\n00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:54,430\nI was looking, for example as you can see,\n\n198\n00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,820\nas Nate's Scrolls down through here, a\npretty long list of events going on there.\n\n199\n00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820\nThere's a lot of stuff, there's an error.\n\n200\n00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,880\nBut if my job is to read these files,\n\n201\n00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,299\na lot of times I'm not all that concerned\nwith the informationals, right?\n\n202\n00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,388\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n203\n00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,210\n>> I mean, I'm going in there\nbecause there's a problem, or\n\n204\n00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,570\nthere's something wrong.\n\n205\n00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,290\nI'm trying to figure out what's going on.\n\n206\n00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,950\nSo I really need to be able to find\nthe important stuff, the criticals,\n\n207\n00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,480\nthe warnings, the things that are telling\nme that there's something wrong, or\n\n208\n00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,980\ncould be something wrong.\n\n209\n00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,114\n>> I think you're talking about a filter.\n\n210\n00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,076\n>> [LAUGH] I am, I am.\n\n211\n00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:34,940\n>> Now, there's a lot of stuff\nin here that gets logged, right?\n\n212\n00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,096\nThese information ones, you know,\nI wouldn't say that they're,\n\n213\n00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:43,145\nuseless is the correct word,\nbut there's a lot of them.\n\n214\n00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:47,775\nAnd, unless you're after\na specific event ID, I guess\n\n215\n00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:53,347\njust banging through this list,\nit can eat up more time than is needed.\n\n216\n00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:54,027\n>> Absolutely.\n\n217\n00:09:55,057 --> 00:10:00,387\n>> There is over in the actions\npane the filter current log,\n\n218\n00:10:00,387 --> 00:10:02,367\nand we can set a filter.\n\n219\n00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,490\n>> Right.\n\n220\n00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,740\n>> There are these three,\nI usually just like to pick,\n\n221\n00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,390\nI like the criticals warnings and error.\n\n222\n00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,990\nClicking those right here and\nwe can just click OK.\n\n223\n00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,250\nAnd it will apply this filter to\nthe current log that we're looking at.\n\n224\n00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,550\nSo we are in the application log,\nand so there now we have, yeah.\n\n225\n00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,670\n>> Look at all those red, good golly.\n\n226\n00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,210\nThat's not good.\n\n227\n00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,073\n>> Yeah,\nwhat lease end user license field?\n\n228\n00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,870\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Uh-oh!\n>> Lease acquisition?\n\n229\n00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,440\n>> Are you running pirated software again?\n\n230\n00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,060\n>> Wait, what, no way!\n>> I told you about that.\n\n231\n00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,970\nNot on live TV.\n\n232\n00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,790\n>> These are all license problems.\n\n233\n00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,290\n>> It was probably having an issue\nreaching out to Microsoft maybe.\n\n234\n00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,720\nI'm sure it's all good now,\nI'm sure it's cleared up.\n\n235\n00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,510\nBut as you guys can see at home,\nnotice how small or\n\n236\n00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,200\nhow large the scroll\nbar is over there now.\n\n237\n00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,090\nThat was very small,\nit was a huge list of events and\n\n238\n00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:57,200\nnow all he's seeing is the criticals and\nthe warnings and the errors.\n\n239\n00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,680\nAnd as Nate said, there's many times when\nI need to see those informational ones.\n\n240\n00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,230\nSo it's not like they're useless but\n\n241\n00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,170\nusually when I'm troubleshooting\nI'm looking for problems, right?\n\n242\n00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,868\nI'm looking fo,\nwhy did this thing not launch?\n\n243\n00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,695\nWhy did this not install?\n\n244\n00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:13,695\nSo in my event log system,\nthere should be a warning or\n\n245\n00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:17,235\nan error of some type, giving me\nan indication of what went wrong, and\n\n246\n00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:21,235\nso quick, easy way to filter that log\ndown and find what we're looking for.\n\n247\n00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:22,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n248\n00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,505\n>> But, now this one here, I'd have to\ndo it every time I came in here, right?\n\n249\n00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:29,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I mean if we go and\n\n250\n00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,320\nclose this event log system,\nwhich we don't want to do right,\n\n251\n00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,910\nbut if we closed it, yeah no more filter.\n\n252\n00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,840\nI'd have to go and\nclick filter current log and do it again.\n\n253\n00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,142\nSo, great for when you're coming in,\ntroubleshooting, but\n\n254\n00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:49,038\nwhat if we wanna set up a nice\nview that we have every time,\n\n255\n00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:52,880\nthat only includes the stuff\nthat I need to look at.\n\n256\n00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,260\nMy job is to sit down everyday, and\n\n257\n00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,960\ntake a look at the event logs\nfrom 15 different servers.\n\n258\n00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,390\nAnd so, I have to go in and\n\n259\n00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:07,190\nI have to filter my view on each one of\nthose as I remote into it, crazy, right?\n\n260\n00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,650\nThere's gotta be something we could do,\nright?\n\n261\n00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,545\n>> Are you pitching this up?\n\n262\n00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:12,110\n>> [LAUGH] I am, man.\n\n263\n00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,964\nHere's that softball, coming right at you.\n\n264\n00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:15,453\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [SOUND] Pow.\n\n265\n00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:16,091\n>> Nice, thanks Mike.\n\n266\n00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:17,160\n>> Yeah, man.\n\n267\n00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,920\n>> All right, so\nnow with these filter logs,\n\n268\n00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,760\nwe can save them so it's a one click\neasy thing so we can come back to and\n\n269\n00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,500\ncheck for certain events all the time and\nyeah, we'll go and create one.\n\n270\n00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,580\nNow, I did jump to the system,\nlittle event of logs here.\n\n271\n00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,816\nBut for this one,\nlet's just get to critical end and errors.\n\n272\n00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:44,373\n>> Okay.\n\n273\n00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:46,407\n>> All right, critical and errors,\n\n274\n00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:50,700\nwe'll just grab all the event ID's\nwithin those two categories there.\n\n275\n00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,860\nAnd click OK.\n\n276\n00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,652\n>> Nice.\n\n277\n00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,078\n>> And we will-\n>> [CROSSTALK] There's our nice-\n\n278\n00:12:59,078 --> 00:12:59,578\n>> Oh, yes.\n\n279\n00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,440\n>> There's our nice, filtered view.\n\n280\n00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,910\nAnd yep go ahead.\n\n281\n00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,780\n>> All right.\n\n282\n00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,888\n>> Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.\n\n283\n00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:10,532\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> And so then over here, yep there it is,\n\n284\n00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:12,750\nsave filter to custom view.\n\n285\n00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:14,610\n>> Nice.\n\n286\n00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,930\n>> So you save this and\nwhat should we save this as?\n\n287\n00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,640\n>> I would call it something like\ncritical and errors from system.\n\n288\n00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,970\n>> Error stuff.\n>> Or error stuff, yeah,\n\n289\n00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,100\nerror stuff works.\n\n290\n00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,606\nError Stuff and we'll-\n>> [CROSSTALK] Your upper admins will love\n\n291\n00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:29,383\nyou for that.\n\n292\n00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:31,701\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nI use just general words for\n\n293\n00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,568\nthings so that way if they\nneed to know what it is, like,\n\n294\n00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:38,353\nwell you have to ask Nate because this\nis some weird, crazy description.\n\n295\n00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:40,440\n>> That's Nate's way\nof doing job security.\n\n296\n00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:48,076\nThey can't fire me because they can't\nfigure out what the hell I've done.\n\n297\n00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,460\n[LAUGH] Very good.\n\n298\n00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,080\nAll right, so\nyou're gonna save this as error stuff, and\n\n299\n00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,900\nit looks like it's giving you a choice\nof where you want to save it.\n\n300\n00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,050\n>> Yeah, I-\n>> And you put it under your?\n\n301\n00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,865\n>> Yeah, I kinda jumped the gun, but\nyes we could save it to a certain path.\n\n302\n00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:05,710\n>> Mm-hm\n>> We had a folder where these filters\n\n303\n00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,960\nare going to or something,\n\n304\n00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,676\nsome kind of a place where we could all-\n>> [CROSSTALK] We'll show them in\n\n305\n00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:11,396\na bit, yeah.\n\n306\n00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:13,834\nSo yeah,\nhe put it under his custom views up there,\n\n307\n00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:16,248\nto me that's a perfect place to put them,\nright?\n\n308\n00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:19,940\nThere's a node over there\ncalled Custom Views, and so\n\n309\n00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,180\nthat's a good place to\nsave my custom views.\n\n310\n00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,230\nNow, the cool thing about this is\nhe doesn't have to recreate it\n\n311\n00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,780\nevery time, right.\n\n312\n00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,890\nHe doesn't have to go back in and\ndo that filter.\n\n313\n00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,540\nHe just logs in on the machine, opens\nup event viewer, clicks on error stuff,\n\n314\n00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,750\nand ta-da, there's his nice filtered log.\n\n315\n00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,710\nNow, if he had not already filtered\nthe log, cuz he filtered the log and\n\n316\n00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,690\nthen click save filter as custom view.\n\n317\n00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,190\nYou'll notice over there on\nthe right in the actions pane,\n\n318\n00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,168\nthere is a create custom view option.\n\n319\n00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:50,960\nSo you could've created it\nfrom scratch from there,\n\n320\n00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,920\nwithout filtering the log first.\n\n321\n00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,020\nAnd the other one we didn't look at is\nthat dropdown list as you just pointed at\n\n322\n00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,330\nthere, logged, Any Time.\n\n323\n00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,500\nBecause a lot of times if I'm doing, this\nis my job that I have to do every day,\n\n324\n00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,270\ncheck these log files, I've already\nseen yesterday's entries, yesterday, so\n\n325\n00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,970\nI really don't want to see the last\nanytime or the last seven days.\n\n326\n00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,440\nI might want to just see the last\n24 hours or something like that.\n\n327\n00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,330\nSo really cool options there.\n\n328\n00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,890\nYou can even do custom ranges.\n\n329\n00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,498\nIf you were suspect that something\nmalicious occurred yesterday between 3\n\n330\n00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:25,470\no'clock and 4 o'clock in the afternoon,\nI can come in there and\n\n331\n00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,900\nI can say I just need to see the events\nfrom this particular timeframe.\n\n332\n00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,120\nSo as I said earlier, I know I sound\ngeeky, it's silly event logs, right,\n\n333\n00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,490\nbut some really cool stuff\nwe can do with them.\n\n334\n00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,360\n>> Looks like your Friday\nnight best friend!\n\n335\n00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,010\n>> I know.\nI mean what else is there to\n\n336\n00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,260\ndo on a Friday night?\n\n337\n00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260\n>> I'm just kidding, that's funny.\n\n338\n00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,235\nI like to, yeah.\n\n339\n00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:47,780\n>> [LAUGH] All right so,\nthat's our custom view.\n\n340\n00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,114\nNow here's where it gets even better, in\nmy opinion again, geeking out on you guys,\n\n341\n00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:57,280\nbecause this custom view,\nis only available on this one machine.\n\n342\n00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,270\nThey're not going to replicate\nto any other machines.\n\n343\n00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,540\nAnd I've got 10 servers that\nI want to use this view on.\n\n344\n00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,637\nWe can export it out,\nit doesn't replicate automatically, but\n\n345\n00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:13,733\nwe can right-click on that,\nerror stuff log, or custom view And\n\n346\n00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:17,920\nwe can choose Export Custom View\nabout half way down.\n\n347\n00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,570\nThere you go.\nNow it's gonna pump this out as\n\n348\n00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,110\nan XML file.\n\n349\n00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,200\nAnd the idea is if we want\nto we can go ahead and\n\n350\n00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,360\ndo it, I don't know if you want to or not.\n\n351\n00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,140\nBut the idea is I could export this out\nto a folder somewhere on my network.\n\n352\n00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,510\nAll right, export this XML file out.\n\n353\n00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,140\nAll right, and why don't we go ahead and\nat least put it out on your desktop or\n\n354\n00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,830\nsomething so we can find it.\n\n355\n00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,070\nAnd so\nwe can see what the file looks like there.\n\n356\n00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,740\nBut you can take that XML file and I could\nput it on a shared folder on my network.\n\n357\n00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,070\nAnd then I could go to any machine,\nconnect to that shared folder and\n\n358\n00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,120\nthen import that custom view.\n\n359\n00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,900\nDo we have a share set up already?\n\n360\n00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,178\nIf not we could make one real quick.\n\n361\n00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:58,558\n>> Yeah, I thought we did on this machine.\n\n362\n00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,610\n>> But yeah, easy to do.\n\n363\n00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,180\nAll you're gonna have to do,\nin fact we don't even have to.\n\n364\n00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,290\nIf you want to go back into your event log\n\n365\n00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,930\nLet's just show them what\nit looks like to import.\n\n366\n00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,990\nSo on your desktop, sorry I'm just\nmaking you jump all over the place.\n\n367\n00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,010\n>> No, no, no.\n>> You see where he has that XML file, so\n\n368\n00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,800\nthat is that custom view\nthat he's exported out.\n\n369\n00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,610\nNow let's pretend we're on another machine\nand go ahead and open up your event here.\n\n370\n00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,330\n>> Down here?\n\n371\n00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,180\n>> And\nright click on that custom views, and\n\n372\n00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,370\nlet's do Import Custom View\n>> And then you can browse and find that.\n\n373\n00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,500\nNow you will need to give it a different\nname since you already have one called\n\n374\n00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,020\nevents error stuff.\n\n375\n00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,572\nAgain, we're doing it on the same machine\nso it's kinda a little tricky but\n\n376\n00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:46,716\nyeah just select it and click Open.\n\n377\n00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,692\nAnd then maybe give it a error stuff\ntwo or whatever you want to call it,\n\n378\n00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:50,257\nI dont know.\n\n379\n00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:54,296\nFirst of two.\n\n380\n00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:55,388\nOr error stuff.\n\n381\n00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:56,351\nOr more error stuff.\n\n382\n00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:57,291\nNice.\n\n383\n00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:57,954\nAnd there you go.\n\n384\n00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:58,731\nIt was that easy.\n\n385\n00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:01,250\nHe was able to import that custom\nview right into this machine.\n\n386\n00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,270\nSo very cool options,\nwhat they've given us there.\n\n387\n00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,630\nMakes it really easy, when you've got\nto work with dozens of servers, and\n\n388\n00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,790\nyou unfortunately got tasked with\nthe responsibility of perusing,\n\n389\n00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,720\nthose log files.\n\n390\n00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,200\nCuz it's not fun, but\nsome bodies got to do it.\n\n391\n00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,650\nI mean there's no point in logging,\nif no bodies going to go in, and\n\n392\n00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,390\nlook at the log files.\n\n393\n00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,530\nAgain we're doing this on\na server operating system,\n\n394\n00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,880\nit's the exact same thing on Windows 8.\n\n395\n00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,533\nYou have the same options,\nthe same custom views,\n\n396\n00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:31,578\nthe same filters, the same log files.\n\n397\n00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,039\nSo, no difference there.\n\n398\n00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,876\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n399\n00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:38,659\nNow, so yeah,\nthat was just like a general filter thing.\n\n400\n00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,481\nYou can also filter by event ID.\n\n401\n00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:46,717\nLet's say if you have some error or\nsomething you saw on the Internet or\n\n402\n00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:52,577\nwhatever, or something on your machine\nthen that customer filer, instead of\n\n403\n00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:57,852\njust picking criticals or whatever,\nwe can still type in an event ID.\n\n404\n00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:00,062\nAnd we'll go through that log and\npull out all those event ID's as well.\n\n405\n00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:05,084\n>> Yeah, absolutely if you know the event\nID for VPN errors then I can go in and\n\n406\n00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:08,653\nfilter it down by that,\ncan I geek out one more time?\n\n407\n00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:09,176\n>> Yes.\n\n408\n00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:13,753\n>> Pull up your custom view one more\ntime I gotta show you guys this because,\n\n409\n00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:18,255\nanother really cool thing is,\npull up the, if you right click on here,\n\n410\n00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:22,632\ngo back to your error stuff one,\npull up the properties for that one.\n\n411\n00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:26,839\nProperties, yep, oh that's not one,\n\n412\n00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:32,480\nEdit Filter,\nyep that should get us back in there.\n\n413\n00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,240\nSo, cuz here's another cool thing\nyou can do with this, right.\n\n414\n00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,660\nNow, what we just set up was this\ncustom view that's filtering\n\n415\n00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,720\nthe system log for\ncriticals and errors, right.\n\n416\n00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,070\nSo, I got other logs on this system.\n\n417\n00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,340\nDo I have to make custom views for\nevery single one?\n\n418\n00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,550\nAbsolutely not.\n\n419\n00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,170\nLook at this.\n\n420\n00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,290\nYou can expand out windows logs there, and\n\n421\n00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,720\nyou can say I wanna see errors and\ncriticals from not only the system log but\n\n422\n00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,220\nthe application log as\nwell as the security log.\n\n423\n00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,233\nAnd maybe I want to include, if there was\na server operating system like this one,\n\n424\n00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,801\ni want to look at the DNS log as well so\nyou can tie it all into a single view.\n\n425\n00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:13,221\nAgain, it just makes my life easier\nrather than have to thumb through 18\n\n426\n00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,805\ndifferent log vals, so.\n\n427\n00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:16,718\n>> So [COUGH]\n>> All right I promise I'm done\n\n428\n00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:17,601\ngeeking out on event logs.\n\n429\n00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:23,102\n>> So, let's say this is a like\na mission critical server here.\n\n430\n00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:26,959\nSo we could select like all the logs.\n\n431\n00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,669\nRight because we wanna know all\neverything of everything and\n\n432\n00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:35,104\nI wanna know everything that's going on,\nso we just click on all stuff,\n\n433\n00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:39,921\nall event ID's, all users, all the logs\nand all that stuff and do it any time.\n\n434\n00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:40,858\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\n\n435\n00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:46,490\nI would say at that point there's really\nnot much reason to have a filter view.\n\n436\n00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,081\nIf you're not going to\nfilter it by anything.\n\n437\n00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,821\nI mean, you're basically saying, just\ndump everything into one big log file.\n\n438\n00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:52,829\nSo maybe not.\n\n439\n00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:54,269\nWindows is not happy about that.\n\n440\n00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:55,082\n>> No, it didn't let me.\n\n441\n00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:56,621\n>> More than ten event logs, and\n\n442\n00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:00,144\nit's going to consume a large amount\nof memory and processor time.\n\n443\n00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:01,362\nDo you want to continue?\n\n444\n00:21:01,362 --> 00:21:02,268\n>> Okay, I'll say no.\n\n445\n00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:03,325\n>> What are you gonna say?\n\n446\n00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,124\nYeah, tell him no.\n\n447\n00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:07,469\nOh wait, I heard everybody say no.\n\n448\n00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:09,129\n>> All right, yeah,\nI don't want to hose up this machine.\n\n449\n00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:10,222\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:12,264\n>> We need this guy a little bit later.\n\n451\n00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:14,423\nSo I'll turn this on after the show.\n\n452\n00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:16,663\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah so,\nlittle known fact, but now you know.\n\n453\n00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:21,027\nTen log files is the max\non that custom view.\n\n454\n00:21:21,027 --> 00:21:25,146\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep, now in the event,\n\n455\n00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:29,423\nviewers, we're kinda hanging out up here.\n\n456\n00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:33,358\nYou know there are Application\nservice logs, things on here.\n\n457\n00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:37,781\nWay down here in Microsoft and in Windows.\n\n458\n00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:40,429\n>> There's a lot of them, aren't there?\n\n459\n00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,148\n>> That's right.\n\n460\n00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:47,225\nThe app locker stuff,\nwhen we wanna roll out app locker,\n\n461\n00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:53,440\nwe just set all the The things\non blocker audit or whatnot?\n\n462\n00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,762\nAnd so there we go,\nwe check for all those.\n\n463\n00:21:55,762 --> 00:22:00,772\n>> [INAUDIBLE] So\nthis is where you would see that.\n\n464\n00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:02,014\n>> Mm-hm, that was a long time ago.\n\n465\n00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:03,593\n>> That was, it seems like forever.\n\n466\n00:22:03,593 --> 00:22:05,567\nAll right, so yeah.\n\n467\n00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,325\nAnd that part will look a little\nbit different on server,\n\n468\n00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:10,380\nbecause obviously on a client.\n\n469\n00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,010\nI'm not gonna see DNS logs,\nDHCP logs, and this like that, so\n\n470\n00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:20,410\nthat'll be a little different but\nit's still there, and like I said earlier,\n\n471\n00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,960\nMicrosoft heard us and said,\nall right, you want more information?\n\n472\n00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,910\nHere you go.\n\n473\n00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,850\nHere's where you can now have\naccess to all this information.\n\n474\n00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,590\nOkay, and it's there.\n\n475\n00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,930\n>> Yeah, knock yourself out.\n\n476\n00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,110\n>> That's it.\n\n477\n00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,340\nAll right, well my friend.\n\n478\n00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,260\nI don't know if we can add\nanything else to event logs.\n\n479\n00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,222\nOh wait, we can, can't we.\n\n480\n00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:45,326\nYou know what we haven't done yet\nis now what if, so\n\n481\n00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:52,110\nwe said we can go to a machine and\nwe can look at the event log, right.\n\n482\n00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,750\nOr we can go in there and\nwe can create our own custom filter, or\n\n483\n00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,540\ncustom view I should call it,\nthat pulls events from multiple log\n\n484\n00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,480\nfiles back into one and\njust what I'm looking for.\n\n485\n00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,148\nThen we can take that and export it and\nimport it into other machines so\n\n486\n00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:08,307\nI don't need to recreate it every time.\n\n487\n00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:12,948\nWhich is all really cool but\nthen there's one more that,\n\n488\n00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:18,466\nI think it just might top the chart\nof coolness for as far as.\n\n489\n00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:19,151\n>> What is it?\n\n490\n00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:20,163\n>> Event subscriptions.\n\n491\n00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:22,241\n>> Event subscriptions!\n\n492\n00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:26,250\n>> Yes, something that Windows\nhas been lacking for some time.\n\n493\n00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,670\nIn my personal opinion, we've had it\navailable in other operating systems,\n\n494\n00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,580\nthis logging and stuff like that.\n\n495\n00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,150\nBut with Windows I was still\ngoing to each machine and\n\n496\n00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,500\nlooking at those event logs, even though\nI had this custom view on that machine,\n\n497\n00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,780\nI could see just what I wanted, I still\nhad to go to that machine to view it.\n\n498\n00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,443\nSo I had to remote into each machine one\nat a time to look at those event logs.\n\n499\n00:23:47,443 --> 00:23:49,959\nNot so much anymore.\n\n500\n00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:50,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n501\n00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,720\n>> Now we can subscribe.\n\n502\n00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,819\n>> Yeah, and so by subscribe, right.\n\n503\n00:23:56,819 --> 00:24:00,640\nSo now there's two types.\n\n504\n00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,198\nThere are push subscription and\npull subscription.\n\n505\n00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:08,772\n>> Lets tell them out there.\n\n506\n00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:11,826\nWhen we talk about subscription,\nbefore we get into how we can do it,\n\n507\n00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,045\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n508\n00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:17,722\nWe're talking about me, sitting at my\nmachine and subscribing to another\n\n509\n00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:22,340\ncomputer's log files, so that they\nare then collected up on my machine.\n\n510\n00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,850\nSo I can sit here, and\n\n511\n00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,850\nread the log files from ten\ndifferent DNS servers on my network.\n\n512\n00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,410\nAnd those DNS servers might\nbe in my server closet,\n\n513\n00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,900\nthey might be in the office on the other\nside of town, they might be in Tokyo.\n\n514\n00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,100\nAnd I can sit here and\n\n515\n00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,990\nread those event logs without\nhaving to remote into machines.\n\n516\n00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,340\nShoot!\nIt's sweet.\n\n517\n00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,900\nAnd now, so that, and we can do it in two\ndifferent ways, with those subscriptions.\n\n518\n00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n519\n00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,110\n>> You got your, I'll give it back to you.\n\n520\n00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,360\n>> I'm taking over, I know.\n\n521\n00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,480\n>> I get excited about this stuff guys.\n\n522\n00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,690\n>> Oh, the two types.\n\n523\n00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,073\n>> Yes, yes.\n>> Yeah, push and pull.\n\n524\n00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:55,071\n>> Push and pull, yes.\n\n525\n00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:59,960\nSo we can have a central\ncomputer that will reach out\n\n526\n00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,870\nto all of the clients that\nhave been subscribed to.\n\n527\n00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,550\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n528\n00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,384\nit will gather those information and\npull it in.\n\n529\n00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,049\n>> Yep.\n>> Or\n\n530\n00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,010\nwe can configure all\nthose machines out there.\n\n531\n00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,030\nWhenever they get that subscription,\n\n532\n00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,755\nthat event ID that we're after, then\nthey will send it to a central computer.\n\n533\n00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:22,360\n>> Yes.\n\n534\n00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,720\n>> And I guess same kind of thing.\n\n535\n00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,440\nJust two different ways of going at it.\n\n536\n00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n537\n00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,600\nYeah, exactly.\n\n538\n00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,566\nI think that in the, when we go in there\nand set it up, we're gonna see that it's\n\n539\n00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:36,835\ncalled either source-driven, meaning that\nthe computers that have the log files,\n\n540\n00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:41,220\nthey'll send their events over when they\nget them, or it could be collector-driven,\n\n541\n00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,303\nwhere the machine I'm sitting\nat is actually reaching out and\n\n542\n00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:46,413\npulling them from those other machines.\n\n543\n00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:49,264\nBut in the end result, yes, I have\nthe log files right here on my machine.\n\n544\n00:25:49,264 --> 00:25:53,184\nWhether it's pushed to me by those guys,\nor whether I reach out and\n\n545\n00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,310\npull it from them.\n\n546\n00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,048\nSo in the end, pretty much the same thing.\n\n547\n00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:57,325\n>> Yeah.\n\n548\n00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,716\nI guess, sweet.\n\n549\n00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:01,005\nSo should we get started, I guess?\n\n550\n00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:02,931\nJust start the process?\n\n551\n00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:04,163\n>> Yeah, what do you think here?\n\n552\n00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:08,002\nTell you what, why don't we open it up and\n\n553\n00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:11,860\ntake a look at, we could, I don't know.\n\n554\n00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,730\n>> With five minutes left here,\ntell you what, let's take our break.\n\n555\n00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,020\nInstead of getting half of the commands\ndone and then breaking and coming back and\n\n556\n00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,280\ndoing the other half of the commands,\nlet's tie it all together.\n\n557\n00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,560\nSo, we'll go ahead and\ntake a break a few minutes early here,\n\n558\n00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,755\ngive you guys a chance to\ngo get something to drink.\n\n559\n00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,680\nGet up and stretch your legs,\nget the blood flowing again, and\n\n560\n00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,930\nwe will meet you back here in just a few,\nand\n\n561\n00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,926\ntalk all about these event subscriptions.\n\n562\n00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,552\n>> After the break.\n\n563\n00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:41,291\n[SOUND]\n\n564\n00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:44,640\nHey, welcome back.\n\n565\n00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,293\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n566\n00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:51,386\nSo picking up where we left\noff with event subscriptions.\n\n567\n00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:54,900\n>> I know you guys have been waiting\non the edge of your seat for this.\n\n568\n00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hopefully.\n\n569\n00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,900\n>> Yeah.\n\n570\n00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,370\nIt's really cool,\n\n571\n00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,148\nright?\nI touched on the last little segment\n\n572\n00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:04,845\nthere.\nSo I think for this one we're gonna do\n\n573\n00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:08,505\na collector initiated.\n>> Okay.\n\n574\n00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:11,675\n>> So we're gonna go to, we're gonna\nhave a domain controller, or just a,\n\n575\n00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:14,315\nlike I said, we're gonna use that for\nour collector.\n\n576\n00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:15,339\n>> Okay.\n>> Doesn't have to be.\n\n577\n00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:17,876\n>> Right.\n>> And we're gonna use our domain\n\n578\n00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:22,658\ncontroller to reach out to\na Windows 8 client machine, and\n\n579\n00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:25,541\ngrab certain events from that guy.\n\n580\n00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:26,713\nI guess whatever we set up.\n\n581\n00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:28,710\n>> I like it, I like it.\n\n582\n00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,411\nAnd it can be done either way.\n\n583\n00:27:30,411 --> 00:27:35,036\nWe're gonna use a server, and we're gonna\ncollect the clients' log files up, and\n\n584\n00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:39,597\na lot of times you might be, you might see\nmore of a, you're sitting at your Windows\n\n585\n00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:44,357\n8 at your desk in your cubicle, and you're\npulling log files from multiple servers,\n\n586\n00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:46,638\nbut if you're the Help Desk support guy,\n\n587\n00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:50,199\nyou might be pulling log files\nback from other client machines.\n\n588\n00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,708\nSo it works in either direction.\n\n589\n00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,159\n>> Yeah.\n\n590\n00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,094\n>> All right,\nlet's get in there and do it.\n\n591\n00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:55,493\nLet's have some fun with this thing.\n\n592\n00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:57,536\nI do like me some subscriptions.\n\n593\n00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:58,906\n>> Yeah, all right.\n\n594\n00:27:58,906 --> 00:28:00,346\nFirst things first.\n\n595\n00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,807\nWe will go to the client machine-\n>> Okay.\n\n596\n00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,961\n>> And we'll start that guy setting up.\n\n597\n00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:07,282\nAnd all right, so here we go.\n\n598\n00:28:07,282 --> 00:28:08,884\nSo this is our client machine.\n\n599\n00:28:08,884 --> 00:28:10,933\n>> Nice desktop background you have there.\n\n600\n00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:13,046\n>> Yeah, thanks.\nYeah, just the standard one.\n\n601\n00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:14,144\n>> Pretty exciting.\n\n602\n00:28:14,144 --> 00:28:18,287\n>> All right we will start with\nan [COUGH] administrative command prompt.\n\n603\n00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:21,393\n>> Yeah cuz there's a couple things\nthat we've got to do to set these\n\n604\n00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:22,363\nsubscriptions up.\n\n605\n00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:27,108\nWe've gotta open up some Firewall, some\nports on our Firewall on the machine that\n\n606\n00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,537\nwe wanna pull the log files from, right?\n\n607\n00:28:29,537 --> 00:28:33,165\nWe're gonna have another machine\nreaching out to this guy, and\n\n608\n00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:35,690\ngetting his log files from him.\n\n609\n00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,525\nSo we've got to open up some holes\nin the Firewall, as well as enable\n\n610\n00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:43,615\nWindows Remote Management which really\ndoes take care of my Firewall rules.\n\n611\n00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:46,938\nSo the command is gonna be WinRM,\nshort for\n\n612\n00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:50,919\nWindows Remote Management,\nspace quickconfig.\n\n613\n00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,142\nKnow that command, hint, hint.\n\n614\n00:28:53,142 --> 00:28:56,970\nThat is a good one to know for\nthe exam, right?\n\n615\n00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,360\nWin RM Quick Config, and\n\n616\n00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,360\nthis is the one you run on the machine\nthat you're getting the log files from.\n\n617\n00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,340\nAll right?\n\n618\n00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,830\nYou're gonna remote,\nthe way I like to remember it,\n\n619\n00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,580\nyou're remotely managing\nthis machine's log files.\n\n620\n00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,990\nSo you're running the Windows\nremote management command.\n\n621\n00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,920\nThere's another command we gotta run on\nthe other side, slightly different and\n\n622\n00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,794\nsometimes it can be easy to confuse\nwhich one you run on which machine.\n\n623\n00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:20,362\nSo WinRM,\n\n624\n00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:24,738\nyou're gonna run that on each machine that\nyou wanna retrieve the log files from.\n\n625\n00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:26,909\nQuick config does the whole thing.\n\n626\n00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,387\nIt turns on the service,\nmakes our Firewall exceptions.\n\n627\n00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:34,724\n>> Yeah, and\nnot only just the clicked event logs,\n\n628\n00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:38,249\nwe've run into WinRM earlier.\n\n629\n00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:38,990\n>> Yeah.\n\n630\n00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,078\n>> And WinRM, it's to remotely manage it.\n\n631\n00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:42,801\n>> Yeah.\n>> We can run it on a server.\n\n632\n00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:46,806\nSo we can execute power\nshow commands on that guy.\n\n633\n00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:48,374\nAll sorts of things.\n\n634\n00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:52,326\nSo, it just sets this machine\nup to be remotely managed.\n\n635\n00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:54,890\nIn this case, event logs.\n\n636\n00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,490\n>> Exactly.\n\n637\n00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,181\nAnd so that tells me what?\n\n638\n00:29:56,181 --> 00:29:58,393\nWinRM is not set up to receive\nrequests on this machine.\n\n639\n00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:00,320\nThe following changes must be made.\n\n640\n00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,803\nWe're gonna have to turn on that\nservice and set it up to auto start.\n\n641\n00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:07,625\nThat is gonna do a delayed auto start,\nbut we want it to start up automatically.\n\n642\n00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:12,758\nSo if that computer reboots, that WinRM\nservice starts up every time it reboots.\n\n643\n00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:19,381\nSo we hit a Y for yes and changed\nthe start up type, it started the service.\n\n644\n00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:24,433\nIt is not setup to allow remote access\nto this machine for management, oh no.\n\n645\n00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:27,700\nThe following changes must be made.\n\n646\n00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,830\nDo you wanna create a listener\non http:// Wild card?\n\n647\n00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,546\nWhat do you call that?\n\n648\n00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:34,748\nAsterisks?\n\n649\n00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:35,885\n>> Asterisks, yeah.\n\n650\n00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:38,370\n>> Somebody else the other day I was\ntalking to, they called it a splat.\n\n651\n00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,571\n>> Yeah.\n\n652\n00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,951\nJay Burky.\n\n653\n00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:43,373\n>> Jay Burky calls it a splat?\n\n654\n00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:44,401\n>> Yeah, wax and splats.\n\n655\n00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:46,003\n>> Yeah, he's trying to.\n\n656\n00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:46,827\n>> So yeah, that's funny.\n\n657\n00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:50,681\nYeah wait, which one is a whack whack or\na slash slash, right?\n\n658\n00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,776\nSlash is forward I think,\nand whack is back?\n\n659\n00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:54,786\nI don't know.\n\n660\n00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,277\nWho knows?\n\n661\n00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:57,734\nWith Jay Burke, you never know.\n\n662\n00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:59,111\nCrazy guy.\n\n663\n00:30:59,111 --> 00:30:59,703\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n664\n00:30:59,703 --> 00:31:01,102\nHe makes half this crap up.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n665\n00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:05,210\nanybody with a Mario background in their\noffice, man, you can't trust them.\n\n666\n00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,030\n>> No.\n\n667\n00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,120\nYeah.\nAbsolutely not.\n\n668\n00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,490\nIt comes on, and you're just like Jay,\nwhat did you do today?\n\n669\n00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,880\nNo, I know you're just kidding.\n\n670\n00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,410\nNo you weren't.\n\n671\n00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,055\nTell me the truth.\n[LAUGH]\n\n672\n00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:13,555\n>> All right.\n\n673\n00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:14,705\nSo we hit yes for that one, and\n\n674\n00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,779\n[INAUDIBLE] around Firewall\nexception has been made.\n\n675\n00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:19,569\n>> So at this point, the collectee,\n\n676\n00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:22,842\nthe one I'm getting the log files from,\n\n677\n00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,105\nis ready to go.\n\n678\n00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:24,813\nRight?\n\n679\n00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:25,933\n>> Almost.\n>> Almost?\n\n680\n00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:27,501\nWhat else do we gotta do?\n\n681\n00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,784\n>> Well let's jump over to our\n\n682\n00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:32,704\ndomain controller.\n>> Yeah the collector, but\n\n683\n00:31:32,704 --> 00:31:34,370\nthe collectee's good.\n\n684\n00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,520\nWe don't have anything else to do here.\n\n685\n00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,048\n>> We'll come back to this guy.\n\n686\n00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:37,709\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n687\n00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:38,871\n>> We'll come back.\n>> So we're just gonna keep you\n\n688\n00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:39,875\nguys in suspense for that one.\n\n689\n00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:40,763\n>> Yeah.\n\n690\n00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:44,083\n>> All right, so we've run WinRM.\nAgain, WinRM Quick Config.\n\n691\n00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,912\n>> [SOUND] Your teacher used to do that?\n\n692\n00:31:45,912 --> 00:31:46,422\n>> What?\n\n693\n00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:50,338\n>> When you're in class,\nstomp the foot, tap the chalk board,\n\n694\n00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:54,874\nwhich meant hey, this is gonna be on\nthe pop quiz this week or whatever.\n\n695\n00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:57,143\n>> No?\nWhat school did you go to?\n\n696\n00:31:57,143 --> 00:31:59,071\n>> Yeah, my teachers helped us out.\n\n697\n00:31:59,071 --> 00:32:02,266\nIf they're gonna tell you something,\nthey're writing something up on the board,\n\n698\n00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:04,620\nand it's gonna show up on\nthe pop quiz tomorrow.\n\n699\n00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,460\nThey'll give you that hint.\n\n700\n00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,350\nThey'll like tap the foot, something,\nso you better know this one.\n\n701\n00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,330\n>> Is this homeschool?\n\n702\n00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,092\n>> You just weren't paying attention.\n\n703\n00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:12,135\nYou were in the back row back there.\n\n704\n00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:13,320\nSleeping.\n\n705\n00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,981\n>> What?\n\n706\n00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:16,442\n>> Yeah, I know, I know.\n\n707\n00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:23,704\nAll right so you're now connecting to our\nserver that we wanna use as the collector.\n\n708\n00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:24,770\n>> Yes\n>> The one that's\n\n709\n00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,060\ngather up the log files\nfrom these other machines.\n\n710\n00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,050\nSo we got a command that we gotta run\non this guy to set him up to do that.\n\n711\n00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,700\nAnd he's got a command prompt open.\n\n712\n00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,100\nHe's gonna adjust his font so\n\n713\n00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,380\nyou guys out in TV Land can see\nit just a little bit better.\n\n714\n00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,720\nBut he's not going to green text.\n\n715\n00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,410\nWhat's up, I thought you'd be all\nMatrix action on me or something.\n\n716\n00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,520\n>> Well, I was saving clicks.\n\n717\n00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,615\n>> Oh okay, got ya.\n>> I was saving clicks.\n\n718\n00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:52,105\n[CROSSTALK] All right, well,\nso what are you gonna run?\n\n719\n00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:56,162\n>> All right, so WCutil, right, Windows,\n\n720\n00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:59,779\nI assume, Windows Event Collector.\n\n721\n00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,950\nUtility.\n\n722\n00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,860\n>> That's right.\n\n723\n00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,718\nWindows Event Collector utility.\n\n724\n00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:06,540\n>> Yap.\n>> That's, and again,\n\n725\n00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,310\nI was telling you guys how I try to\nremember which one you run on which.\n\n726\n00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,810\nWinRM on the remote machine, even though\nthat's not what it stands for, but\n\n727\n00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,500\non the remote machine,\nwe run WinRM, on the collector,\n\n728\n00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,460\nwe run WCutil or\nWindows Event Collector Utility.\n\n729\n00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,825\nAnd then a QC for quick config.\n\n730\n00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:27,060\n>> Yap.\n>> And then we hit Enter,\n\n731\n00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,680\nif you can find the Enter key.\n\n732\n00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,490\nAnd it says this is gonna\nchange it to a delayed start,\n\n733\n00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,200\nare you sure you wanna do that?\n\n734\n00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,470\nHe's like, I'm not really sure of it.\n\n735\n00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,540\nYeah, we'll do it.\n\n736\n00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,140\nAnd there it is.\n\n737\n00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,590\nWindows Event Collector service\nwas configured successfully.\n\n738\n00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,060\nBeautiful.\nSo we got two steps done.\n\n739\n00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,560\nWe've got our collectee set\nup with his WinRM commands,\n\n740\n00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,360\nwhich opened up our Firewalls and\nallowed that remote management.\n\n741\n00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,850\nWe went to the collector and\nwe ran the WCutil.\n\n742\n00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,710\nQC.\nWe had to set him up.\n\n743\n00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,710\nSo the last part is back\nover to the collectee and\n\n744\n00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,290\nthe one piece that he didn't want\nto tell you guys earlier about.\n\n745\n00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,340\n>> Yep, so now for\na computer, any computer,\n\n746\n00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,260\nwhether it be our little domain controller\nor another client or laptop or whatever.\n\n747\n00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,500\nTo allow that computer to\ncome over the network, so\n\n748\n00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,530\neven though we've allowed the exception,\nthe computer that's coming over and\n\n749\n00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,750\nsnagging these events,\nit still needs permissions, right?\n\n750\n00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,190\nTo get in here to grab that stuff.\n\n751\n00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:38,810\nI mean, anybody just can't come over and\ndo whatever they want.\n\n752\n00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,980\n>> That's right, we wanna keep is safe.\n\n753\n00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,160\nWe don't want to have it\nset up on my network and\n\n754\n00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,080\nhave Nate come in with\nhis little laptop and\n\n755\n00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,530\ntry to collect log files from all\nmy machines and anything like that.\n\n756\n00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,448\n>> With my netbook.\n\n757\n00:34:51,448 --> 00:34:52,210\n>> [LAUGH] Yup.\n\n758\n00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,530\nSo yes, you've gotta make sure\nthe collector,the machine that we ran\n\n759\n00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:02,710\nthe WCutil command on, needs to be\nadded to one of two groups really.\n\n760\n00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,330\nWe were discussing this over a break.\n\n761\n00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,970\nThe administrators group\nis one you can use.\n\n762\n00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,960\nAnd a lot of the things, you go out there,\nand when you are studying and read.\n\n763\n00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,720\nThey are going to say just take\nthe collectors computer account,\n\n764\n00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,910\nnot your account.\n\n765\n00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,450\nNot the one you are logging on with,right?\n\n766\n00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,840\nWe are talking about the machine account.\n\n767\n00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,720\nThat one needs to be added to\nthe local administrators group\n\n768\n00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,280\non the machine we are pulling\nwall across from.\n\n769\n00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,490\nSo here is Nate on the collector and he\nis going to open up computer management.\n\n770\n00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,280\nAnd I think he's opened up\ncomputer management there.\n\n771\n00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,290\nOr device manager, you could do device\nmanager if you don't want it to work.\n\n772\n00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,260\nOne of those managers is what we need.\n\n773\n00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,180\nProbably computer\nmanagement would work well.\n\n774\n00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,600\nYeah.\nOr we could take a look at our local\n\n775\n00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,449\nusers and groups.\n\n776\n00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,270\nAnd we can go down into groups and\nwe'll find that administrator's group.\n\n777\n00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,620\nBut while we're in there we can take\na look at that other one as well, right?\n\n778\n00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,620\n>> Yep.\n\n779\n00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,650\nSo this one right here,\nthe event log reader's group.\n\n780\n00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:11,500\nNow on a client adding the collector\ncomputer to the administrators group.\n\n781\n00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,330\nWe'll give it access and\npermission to come over and\n\n782\n00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,370\ngrab those files and head back.\n\n783\n00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,030\nThe event log readers,\nthis is the write, right?\n\n784\n00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,120\nCuz, rights versus permissions,\nthat's the right that the guy needs.\n\n785\n00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,989\nSo if it was a principal\nof least privilege.\n\n786\n00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:33,370\n>> Exactly.\n>> Then we would assign them just that\n\n787\n00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,930\none there, event log readers For\nhim to come over and grab that.\n\n788\n00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,090\n>> It really does come\ndown to best practices.\n\n789\n00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:43,540\nWe're gonna use the administrator's group,\nusually, because sometimes it's easier,\n\n790\n00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,300\nbut it is the lazy admin's\nway of doing it, right.\n\n791\n00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,580\nBecause, yes, the administrator's group\nwill give them access to those event logs,\n\n792\n00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,720\nbut it does a lot more than that, right?\n\n793\n00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,870\nThey now have full control\nover that machine.\n\n794\n00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,250\nBut it is the computer account\nwe're talking about so\n\n795\n00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,940\nprobably not that big of a concern.\n\n796\n00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,660\nThe event log readers group,\nyou give somebody read access and\n\n797\n00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,288\ntechnically that's all they need.\n\n798\n00:37:09,288 --> 00:37:15,180\nBut so either way should work.\n\n799\n00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,790\n>> Administrators.\n\n800\n00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,764\n>> Administrators it is.\n\n801\n00:37:16,764 --> 00:37:20,390\nSo we're going to go into that\nlocal admins group there and\n\n802\n00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,760\nwe are going to add.\n\n803\n00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,420\nIt's funny watching different\npeople use these search dialogues.\n\n804\n00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,100\nEverybody has got their own technique for\ngoing through here.\n\n805\n00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:36,500\nMy, one of the guys that I learned from,\nwhich was a long time ago lets just say.\n\n806\n00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,790\nThis was his technique.\n\n807\n00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,520\nHe would open this thing up and\njust click find now.\n\n808\n00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,090\nNot putting in any filters,\njust click find now, and\n\n809\n00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,880\nyou knew you were going to get everything.\n\n810\n00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,070\nThen you just scroll through and\nlook for what you want.\n\n811\n00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,500\nBut, and that's one way to do it.\n\n812\n00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,330\nNate's like shut up.\n\n813\n00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,420\n>> But no, I've.\n\n814\n00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,050\nNow, I'll tell you a story.\n\n815\n00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,190\n>> Okay, tell me a story.\n\n816\n00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,030\n>> So what I would do-\n>> Have any popcorn?\n\n817\n00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,650\n>> No.\n\n818\n00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,180\nWhat I started out doing whenever\nI was learning this stuff,\n\n819\n00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:11,100\nI would type something in like computer,\nand it would be some long, fancy name.\n\n820\n00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,340\nIt would check names, and every time,\nit wouldn't find anything,\n\n821\n00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,600\neven though I spelled it correctly.\n\n822\n00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,960\nMaybe it was the machine,\nmaybe it was the lab I was in, but\n\n823\n00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,680\nthere is this long stint where whatever I\ntyped in there, it didn't find anything.\n\n824\n00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,540\nAnd so, you know what?\n\n825\n00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,240\nOkay, fine.\n\n826\n00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,410\nJust give me the whole list,\nI'll go find it myself.\n\n827\n00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,430\n>> Wait, okay.\n\n828\n00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,755\n>> And I would find stuff, and then it.\n\n829\n00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:35,355\njust stuck.\n\n830\n00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:36,975\n>> But\nyou've figured it our since then or no?\n\n831\n00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:38,415\n>> No I never got back.\n\n832\n00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:40,785\n>> Okay guys, little side note.\n\n833\n00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:44,715\nThis dialogue box, if we look up at\nthe top where it says select the object\n\n834\n00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:46,485\ntype that we're gonna search for.\n\n835\n00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:47,255\nWhat does it say?\n\n836\n00:38:47,255 --> 00:38:52,750\nUsers, service accounts,\ngroups, what is it missing?\n\n837\n00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,710\nComputers.\n\n838\n00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,540\nIt does not look for computers by default.\n\n839\n00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,350\nSo, if we put a little check mark in\nthere for computers, then we click OK.\n\n840\n00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,750\nCause here's the beautiful\nthing about this.\n\n841\n00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,460\nYou don't have to type the whole name,\njust the first couple letters.\n\n842\n00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,636\nJust type in, I don't know.\n\n843\n00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,067\nWhat's the name of the computer?\n\n844\n00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:14,580\nIsn't it ITPro?\n\n845\n00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,680\nLook at that.\n\n846\n00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680\nIt's amazing.\n\n847\n00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,450\n>> No.\nIt was\n\n848\n00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,170\nuser counts that was doing it to me.\n\n849\n00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,790\n>> If it's local it does have an issue.\n\n850\n00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,520\nYou yeah, you've gotta type, yeah,\nit's a pain when there's local accounts.\n\n851\n00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,500\nSo if you're in work groups, in your\nstudy, little test groups like that\n\n852\n00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,780\nit probably does give you issues,\nand I can definitely see that.\n\n853\n00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,470\nIn a domain environment though, man that\nthing is handy, because you just got to\n\n854\n00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,540\ntype the first couple letters,\ncheck names, and it usually finds it.\n\n855\n00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,510\nSo anyway, back to what we're\nsupposed to be learning.\n\n856\n00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,000\nSorry, a little side not there.\n\n857\n00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,880\nSo you have found the computer account.\n\n858\n00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,870\nNot the user account.\n\n859\n00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,229\nThe computer account for\nthe collector machine.\n\n860\n00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:51,540\n>> Yap.\n>> And we are now going to add that to\n\n861\n00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,030\nthe local administrator's\ngroup on the collectee.\n\n862\n00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,358\nSo there we can see lack\n/ IT Pro TV- dc1 is now\n\n863\n00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,561\nan administrator on cl1\nI think his name is.\n\n864\n00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:06,496\nSomething like that.\n\n865\n00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:07,720\n>> Close enough.\n>> Beautiful.\n\n866\n00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,781\nWe did three things, right?\n\n867\n00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:11,209\n>> Yep.\n\n868\n00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:16,184\nWinRM quick config on the source computer.\n\n869\n00:40:16,184 --> 00:40:16,851\n>> Yep.\n\n870\n00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:22,725\n>> And\nit was WEC util QC on the collector.\n\n871\n00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:25,200\n>> Yep.\n\n872\n00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,880\n>> Then adding the collector to\nthe local administrator's group or\n\n873\n00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,728\nthe event log readers group\non the source computer.\n\n874\n00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:33,527\n>> That's it.\n\n875\n00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:34,320\nBeautiful.\n\n876\n00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,230\n>> Now and this is for\n\n877\n00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,930\na collector initiated pull\ntype event logs description.\n\n878\n00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,550\n>> Yep.\n>> It should work for you then.\n\n879\n00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,280\nIt should work for you then.\n\n880\n00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,780\n>> Right.\n\n881\n00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,050\n>> So now we've got it all set up.\n\n882\n00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,660\nBut is it going to start pulling logs now?\n\n883\n00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,755\nWhat do you think?\n\n884\n00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:53,480\n[LAUGH].\n\n885\n00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,060\nBecause we've got to subscribe, right.\n\n886\n00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,810\nJust like you would to,\n\n887\n00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,600\nyou've got to decide which events\ndo you want to subscribe to.\n\n888\n00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,300\nWhat do you wanna see?\n\n889\n00:40:59,300 --> 00:40:59,870\nEverything?\n\n890\n00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,980\nJust this log, just that log,\njust whatever.\n\n891\n00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,120\n>> Should we look at the logs\nthat we have available?\n\n892\n00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,890\n>> I think we should.\n\n893\n00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,680\nSo you're gonna go to the collector, oops.\n\n894\n00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,510\nWell you want to set up a subscription,\nright?\n\n895\n00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,610\nLet's do it.\n>> We've\n\n896\n00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,820\ngotta make sure that the logs\nare here that we can subscribe?\n\n897\n00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,950\n>> Oh.\n>> Maybe or what?\n\n898\n00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,870\n>> You guys know what logs are there,\ndon't we?\n\n899\n00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,820\nAm I in the standard three?\n\n900\n00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,240\nWhich, I mean, should we pick one?\n\n901\n00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,970\n>> No.\n\n902\n00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,470\n>> No?\n>> No.\n\n903\n00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,150\nYou don't have any events in there?\n\n904\n00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,830\nMaybe you have a filter going on?\n\n905\n00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,420\n>> Number of events is\njust being a little slow.\n\n906\n00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,490\nIt's really slow.\n\n907\n00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,570\n>> Well let's jump right over and\nsetup a description.\n\n908\n00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,650\n>> I know what's there.\n\n909\n00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,510\nIf you guys watched the first segment,\nyou know what log files are there.\n\n910\n00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,070\n>> All right.\n\n911\n00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,860\nJust in case,\nwe're gonna look for Event ID 12.\n\n912\n00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,380\n>> No we're not.\n\n913\n00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,755\n>> I'm just saying, just in case.\n\n914\n00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,730\n[LAUGH] We'll at least pick number 12.\n\n915\n00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,378\n>> No we're not.\n\n916\n00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:56,090\n[LAUGH] I'm not gonna set up a description\nfor one particular Event ID, am I?\n\n917\n00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,220\nI see all of them.\n\n918\n00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,640\n>> I'm saying, at the very least,\nif it doesn't work out.\n\n919\n00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,211\n>> It's gonna reach over and punch him.\n\n920\n00:42:04,211 --> 00:42:09,042\n[LAUGH] If you wanna see a hand\nreach out into my camera view here,\n\n921\n00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,691\n[SOUND] There it goes.\n\n922\n00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:13,152\nHe's like, \"Shut up.\".\n\n923\n00:42:13,152 --> 00:42:19,720\nAll right, so he's logging back in to Mr.\nDC1, which is our collector.\n\n924\n00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:26,470\nAnd we are gonna to go into\nthe event log system here, and\n\n925\n00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:31,000\nwe're gonna go down to the very bottom,\nwhere we've got subscriptions.\n\n926\n00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,260\nAnd this is where we're gonna\ncreate our subscriptions.\n\n927\n00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,008\nSo, you could right-click on it.\n\n928\n00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:37,611\nI'm a right-clicker,\nI don't know about you.\n\n929\n00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:40,320\nYou guys probably are aware\nfrom other episodes,\n\n930\n00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,790\nthat actions pane over there on\nthe right is, usually your context menu.\n\n931\n00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,110\nSame thing you would see if\nyou right-click on things.\n\n932\n00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:47,950\n>> Generally.\n>> It annoys me.\n\n933\n00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,830\nMicrosoft has started taking away\nright-click in some of the consoles.\n\n934\n00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,660\n>> Can we know what this guy does.\n\n935\n00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660\n>> Yes.\nYou can hide actions pane altogether.\n\n936\n00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,770\n>> There.\nThat's what I wanted.\n\n937\n00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,905\n>> Yeah.\nBut that, and that's what I was saying.\n\n938\n00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:01,925\nNow some of the consoles I see now,\nyou try to right-click\n\n939\n00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:05,475\nover there on the left and you get nothing\nand you have to use the actions pane.\n\n940\n00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:08,195\nIt's like come on, I'm a right-clicker.\n\n941\n00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:10,559\nSo anyway, he is going to\nright-click on Subscriptions or\n\n942\n00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,655\nclick Create Subscription\nover there on the right.\n\n943\n00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,308\nAnd this is where we\nare gonna give it a name.\n\n944\n00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:21,910\nAll right, Mike, you're pretty good\nwith those naming conventions.\n\n945\n00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:24,670\nYou've got event stuff and\nmore event stuff.\n\n946\n00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,630\nThis is gonna be remote event stuff.\n\n947\n00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,880\nMaybe, or things to collect.\n\n948\n00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,493\nThere we go, things to collect, alright.\n\n949\n00:43:35,808 --> 00:43:37,904\nAnd then we've got a couple\nthings we gotta choose.\n\n950\n00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:41,655\nDestination log, I honestly don't\nknow why you would change that.\n\n951\n00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:47,331\n[CROSSTALK] I guess the idea here is\nthat if you were pulling up a particular\n\n952\n00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:53,398\nlog from five different computers,\nyou wanted to combine them all into one.\n\n953\n00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:58,619\nMaybe, like if I was pulling the DNS\nlog from five different DNS servers\n\n954\n00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:03,404\nback to one central DNS server,\nwell I’ve already got a DNS log,\n\n955\n00:44:03,404 --> 00:44:08,189\nmaybe I just dump all five of those\nDNS servers into its DNS log, so\n\n956\n00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,737\nI really have one massive DNS log.\n\n957\n00:44:10,737 --> 00:44:14,517\nBut I like the forwarded events\nbecause that's where I can go and\n\n958\n00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:17,317\nI know these are events\nfrom remote machines and\n\n959\n00:44:17,317 --> 00:44:21,390\nI don't get them confused with\nevents on my local machine.\n\n960\n00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,030\n>> Word.\n>> But anyway, forwarded events.\n\n961\n00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,860\nAnd there's the option\nNate was talking about.\n\n962\n00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,950\nCollector initiated or\nsource Computer initiated.\n\n963\n00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,760\n>> Huh?\nYeah, we're gonna go with collector\n\n964\n00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,180\non this one, and, yeah, I guess that's\nwhat we've already been working on.\n\n965\n00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,470\n>> So in this case,\nthe collector's gonna reach out and\n\n966\n00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:46,490\ntalk to the source computer, right?\n\n967\n00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,400\nSo we are going to browse and\n\n968\n00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,190\nwe are going to find the machine that\nwe want to pull the Log Pals from.\n\n969\n00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:56,860\nIt would already have to have\nwhen our input config run on it.\n\n970\n00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,780\nSo, that has to be done ahead of time and\nthat I love.\n\n971\n00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,500\nThank you, Microsoft.\n\n972\n00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,860\nLove the ability to test it before.\n\n973\n00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,660\nI can just say, oh, look it's working.\n\n974\n00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,690\nI know I did it right.\n\n975\n00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:12,140\n>> Let me guess, so if it didn't work,\n\n976\n00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,430\nthen we could check our event logs and\nthen find out why it didn't work.\n\n977\n00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,242\n>> We could, how about that?\n\n978\n00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:19,200\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\nWe're already in there.\n\n979\n00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:19,880\n>> But not remotely.\n\n980\n00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,860\nWe'd have to go up to it.\n\n981\n00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,900\nWe can't collect them.\n\n982\n00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,860\n>> Yep.\n>> We could.\n\n983\n00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,050\nSo there you go.\n\n984\n00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:25,670\nI see you've added it.\n\n985\n00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,160\nWe click okay.\n\n986\n00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,700\nBeautiful.\n\n987\n00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:32,460\nThe last thing we've got to do is decide,\nwhat do we want to collect?\n\n988\n00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,696\nEverything, just a little bit,\njust event ID 12?\n\n989\n00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:42,140\n[LAUGH] So, but you can see,\nwe've seen this dialog before, right?\n\n990\n00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,950\nIf you guys watched through\nthe first segment here,\n\n991\n00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,950\nit's the same dialog that we\nused to set up a custom view.\n\n992\n00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,170\nIt's the same dialog that we used\nto filter the current log, so\n\n993\n00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,580\nyou've seen this dialog before.\n\n994\n00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,160\nIt works the exact same way.\n\n995\n00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,140\nYou've got your log,\nany time, last 7, last 24, or\n\n996\n00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,809\nwhatever, you've got your\ncritical warning errors.\n\n997\n00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,200\nWhatever you want to select.\n\n998\n00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,170\nI'm going to let Nate pick\nwhatever he wants here.\n\n999\n00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,480\nHe's going for the setup log,\nwhich is probably nothing in it, so\n\n1000\n00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,490\nit ought to be interesting.\n\n1001\n00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,636\n>> Oops.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1002\n00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:17,130\n>> So I'm going to, we'll do system.\n\n1003\n00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,850\n>> Sure.\n\n1004\n00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:18,620\n>> System logs and.\n\n1005\n00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,520\n>> Do it all, get happy.\n\n1006\n00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,790\n>> We'll\n>> Okay.\n\n1007\n00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,300\n>> I don't know.\n\n1008\n00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,321\n>> Well,\nas long as it's less than ten [CROSSTALK]\n\n1009\n00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:26,307\n>> Less than ten [CROSSTALK] earlier.\n\n1010\n00:46:26,307 --> 00:46:28,600\nOtherwise we run out of memory and\nprocessor on this machine.\n\n1011\n00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:34,120\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, critical error and warning.\n\n1012\n00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,340\n>> Okay.\n>> So we'll grab those guys and\n\n1013\n00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,700\nthere's bound to be some,\n\n1014\n00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,640\nand we'll do any event ID since we'll\njust grab out of those categories.\n\n1015\n00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,280\n>> All right.\n>> All users and the computers there and\n\n1016\n00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,200\nthat works.\n\n1017\n00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,170\nOkay?\n\n1018\n00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,220\n>> Okay.\nBeautiful.\n\n1019\n00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:49,880\n>> Yeah, and there we go.\n\n1020\n00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,680\nSo we have our server name as select,\nwe've got our name and\n\n1021\n00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,240\nwhere it's going to go and our computers\nthat we're going to pull it from.\n\n1022\n00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,170\nAnd if we had multiple computers,\nlike a whole department perhaps,\n\n1023\n00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,200\nthen all those machines\nwould be added to this list.\n\n1024\n00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,660\nThat's easier than go out and\n[COUGH] collect those.\n\n1025\n00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,370\n>> Yeah, very good point.\n\n1026\n00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,200\nWe're not setting up an individual\nsubscription for every single machine.\n\n1027\n00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,230\nWe set up one subscription to cover all 20\nof those clients over there in the sales\n\n1028\n00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,535\ndepartment, or all 10 of those\ndomain controllers or DNS servers.\n\n1029\n00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:22,600\nSo,now you can have multiple events.\n\n1030\n00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,400\nI might have one subscription to all the\nclients in marketing, another subscription\n\n1031\n00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,750\nfor all the clients over in the Pensacola\noffice, or something like that.\n\n1032\n00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,870\nSo you can have multiple subscriptions\nas well as multiple computers\n\n1033\n00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,090\nwithin a subscription.\n\n1034\n00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:39,810\n>> All right,\nwe'll click OK and there we go.\n\n1035\n00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,370\nSo there's our subscription and the stuff.\n\n1036\n00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:46,320\nIt is an active collector-initiate type.\n\n1037\n00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,400\nThere's only one computer\nin our subscription deal.\n\n1038\n00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,950\nThat's where it's gonna go and\nthat is what it is called.\n\n1039\n00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:53,480\n>> Nice.\n\n1040\n00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,700\nYou got a description in there.\n\n1041\n00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,258\nThat's nice.\n\n1042\n00:47:55,258 --> 00:47:57,079\nThat's nice.\n\n1043\n00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:57,770\n>> All right.\n\n1044\n00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,000\nSo what's next.\n\n1045\n00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,810\n>> That's it.\n\n1046\n00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:00,347\nRight?\n\n1047\n00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:01,959\nNo we probably want to\nlook at it don't we?\n\n1048\n00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:04,037\nWe want to see what's going on.\n\n1049\n00:48:04,037 --> 00:48:07,172\nNow, good thing, this is a good point.\n\n1050\n00:48:07,172 --> 00:48:11,375\nIt doesn't reach out and\ngo get past events.\n\n1051\n00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,842\nEvents that have already happened\nare not gonna show up in here.\n\n1052\n00:48:14,842 --> 00:48:19,062\nIt's gonna be events from,\nwhen we set our subscription and on.\n\n1053\n00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,117\nThere's like if you\nsubscribe to a magazine,\n\n1054\n00:48:21,117 --> 00:48:23,390\nthey're not gonna send you\nall their back issues.\n\n1055\n00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,234\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You get that magazine from then\n\n1056\n00:48:25,234 --> 00:48:26,090\non, right?\n\n1057\n00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,480\n>> It'd be cool, though, if they did.\n\n1058\n00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,510\n>> It would be pretty cool if they did,\nbut, unfortunately,\n\n1059\n00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:30,130\nit doesn't work that way.\n\n1060\n00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,880\nSo, we really need to trigger some events.\n\n1061\n00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,120\nOn that other machine.\n\n1062\n00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,400\nSo, did you do informational?\n\n1063\n00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,020\n>> No.\n\n1064\n00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,590\n>> I do have an idea that we could try.\n\n1065\n00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,730\n>> Let's try.\nNate's gonna\n\n1066\n00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,170\nmake an error on our machine here.\n\n1067\n00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:47,800\nSometimes when you're testing this\nout it might be good to include\n\n1068\n00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,150\nthe informational, just because you know\nsome events are gonna get generated.\n\n1069\n00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:55,250\nYou go to reboot the machine, or do a GP\nupdate, or something that's gonna succeed,\n\n1070\n00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,390\nand it's gonna generate some events.\n\n1071\n00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:02,190\nAnd then you could always take those out\nof your subscription, the informationals,\n\n1072\n00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,800\nif you wanted to leave just the criticals,\nand the warnings.\n\n1073\n00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,065\nOtherwise, we gotta somehow trigger\na critical or a warning or an error.\n\n1074\n00:49:10,065 --> 00:49:12,240\nBecause that's all we subscribed for.\n\n1075\n00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,520\nBut in the real world,\nthat's typically all you wanna see, right?\n\n1076\n00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,810\nI need to see the problems\nthat are going on.\n\n1077\n00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,545\nSo Nate's gonna do some magic here,\nI think.\n\n1078\n00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:21,659\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I was just gonna force it off.\n\n1079\n00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,810\nWithout cleanly shutting down.\n\n1080\n00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:24,890\nThat should generate some events.\n\n1081\n00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,380\n>> That should generate\nsomething nasty in there.\n\n1082\n00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,900\n>> All right, and this, it is kinda small.\n\n1083\n00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,100\nThis is our VM host machine that runs\nall these VMs that we're working with.\n\n1084\n00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:38,110\nAnd in here, that's our client\ncomputer up there at the top.\n\n1085\n00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,560\nCO1, it is kind of small.\n\n1086\n00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,510\nWe don't generally show the, this one, but\n\n1087\n00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,470\nin these options there's\none that's turned off.\n\n1088\n00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:48,980\nAnd this would just be like yanking\nthe power plug on the machine.\n\n1089\n00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,702\n[CROSSTALK] So,\nwe're just gonna turn it off and\n\n1090\n00:49:50,702 --> 00:49:53,299\nit's like, are you sure there's\npeople logged on like doing things.\n\n1091\n00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:54,101\n>> You might lose data.\n\n1092\n00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:57,450\n>> And we're not giving another\nwarning again and say yes.\n\n1093\n00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,516\nJust shut it down, and\nthere it goes and its off.\n\n1094\n00:49:59,516 --> 00:50:01,003\n>> Its gone.\n\n1095\n00:50:01,003 --> 00:50:01,508\n>> Yep.\n\n1096\n00:50:01,508 --> 00:50:03,127\n>> And now its gonna be blue screen.\n\n1097\n00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:08,783\nNo [CROSSTALK]\n>> Would generate at\n\n1098\n00:50:08,783 --> 00:50:13,242\nleast a couple of warning in there, that\nthis machine was shut down improperly.\n\n1099\n00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:15,140\nSo, let's see what happens.\n\n1100\n00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,870\nWe're gonna boot it back up.\n\n1101\n00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,550\n>> Yep.\n>> It might not even have to wait.\n\n1102\n00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,730\nWhy don't we go check, and\n\n1103\n00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,420\nsee what's going on in that event log\nsystem over there, and see what it says.\n\n1104\n00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,890\nI guess it probably needs to boot up\nbefore it can actually retrieve the log\n\n1105\n00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,990\nfiles from Windows, so\nit might not show up just yet, but\n\n1106\n00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:31,860\nit ought to be pretty quick.\n\n1107\n00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:34,230\nOught to be pretty quick.\n\n1108\n00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:43,650\nStill not, did you refresh that?\n\n1109\n00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:44,330\nNothing?\n\n1110\n00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,760\nAll right, I tell you what,\nwhile we're here, just in case,\n\n1111\n00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,560\nwhy don't we change our subscription\nto include some informationals?\n\n1112\n00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,860\nFrom some more logs, so\nwe can at least see some of those guys.\n\n1113\n00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,843\nSo, if you go down to subscriptions,\nand then we edit that bad boy.\n\n1114\n00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:01,432\nAnd select your events.\n\n1115\n00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:06,040\nAnd once you include your informational.\n\n1116\n00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,630\nAnd change your event logs\nwhere you got system.\n\n1117\n00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,100\nYeah, go ahead and\ndo system security and application.\n\n1118\n00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,670\nThat way we know we're\ngonna get something.\n\n1119\n00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,260\n>> All right.\n>> See.\n\n1120\n00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,128\n>> I would think so.\n\n1121\n00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:22,838\nJust so\nyou guys can see at home what it looks,\n\n1122\n00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:25,964\nwhen those forward events come over,\nshould definitely see some of those there.\n\n1123\n00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:31,806\nAll right, so\nnow I go back over to our client.\n\n1124\n00:51:31,806 --> 00:51:34,200\nLet's do something, let's make it mad.\n\n1125\n00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,600\n[LAUGH]\nYes, so we're gonna go round and\n\n1126\n00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,040\nround about, you closing that\ndarn remote desktop session.\n\n1127\n00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,030\n>> I know.\nI should create some-\n\n1128\n00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,330\n>> You could just minimize it first of\n\n1129\n00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,640\nall since you're gonna go back to it.\n\n1130\n00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,860\nMaybe it didn't restart properly.\n\n1131\n00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,540\nThat could be an issue.\n\n1132\n00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,226\nIt could be why we're not seeing events.\n\n1133\n00:51:52,226 --> 00:51:53,774\nI told you it was going to be blue screen.\n\n1134\n00:51:53,774 --> 00:51:56,640\n[LAUGH] Sorry, didn't mean to curse you.\n\n1135\n00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,234\n>> No.\n\n1136\n00:51:57,234 --> 00:52:00,930\n>> Here it goes.\n\n1137\n00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,280\n>> No, this is the host.\n\n1138\n00:52:04,928 --> 00:52:07,170\nSo he's gonna jump back into,\nwhile he's getting this going,\n\n1139\n00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:11,260\nhe's gonna jump back in to\nour Hyper-V server, and\n\n1140\n00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,600\nsee what is going on with that\nclient why it did not reboot?\n\n1141\n00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,610\nIt shows running,\nis that the log on screen or\n\n1142\n00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,007\nis that a blue screen [LAUGH] down there?\n\n1143\n00:52:19,007 --> 00:52:21,684\n[CROSSTALK] It's making updates.\n\n1144\n00:52:21,684 --> 00:52:23,809\nMan, no wonder, all right.\n\n1145\n00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:25,000\nWell.\n\n1146\n00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,700\nThat's I was gonna say.\n\n1147\n00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,130\nWe really should get a ton of events now.\n\n1148\n00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:28,800\n>> We really should.\n\n1149\n00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,940\nAll right, so I tell you what ladies and\ngentlemen here's what were gonna do.\n\n1150\n00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,470\nWe're gonna go take a break, and\ngive you guys a chance to get up and\n\n1151\n00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,720\nget the blood flowing again.\n\n1152\n00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,010\nWhen we come back,\n\n1153\n00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:41,030\nwe are gonna show you some of those events\nthat got forwarded over to our collector.\n\n1154\n00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,133\nSo sit tight, and we'll be right back.\n\n1155\n00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:51,176\n[MUSIC]\n\n1156\n00:52:51,176 --> 00:52:53,074\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n1157\n00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:09,962\nAll right, so we've got our events\nthat has been collected [CROSSTALK].\n\n1158\n00:53:09,962 --> 00:53:12,649\nFrom where we left off last time.\n\n1159\n00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:14,008\n>> Yep.\n\n1160\n00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:17,061\n>> And yeah,\nI guess we can jump back into the-\n\n1161\n00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,310\n>> Kill the suspense.\n\n1162\n00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,350\nI know you guys were dying for\nus to come back and say well let’s see it.\n\n1163\n00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,290\nLet’s see what happens,\nso, let’s check it out.\n\n1164\n00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:30,110\nIf I can get Mr. Producer to pull my\nscreen up, I will flip over to DC-1.\n\n1165\n00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:34,970\nAnd here already in our forwarded events,\nand\n\n1166\n00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:39,360\nthere's all those event logs or\nlog entries I guess I should say.\n\n1167\n00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:44,190\nAnd what you can see, what you'll notice\nis over here in the far column computer,\n\n1168\n00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,930\nthe source of these events is CL1.\n\n1169\n00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,210\nSo, I'm on DC1, and\nI'm reading the log files from CL1.\n\n1170\n00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,590\nHow's that for convenient, right?\n\n1171\n00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:57,750\nAnd a lot of times, it's like.\n\n1172\n00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,585\n>> Yeah, great.\n\n1173\n00:53:58,585 --> 00:54:00,800\n>> [LAUGH] No.\n\n1174\n00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,040\nUsually, I would probably\nsee this in reverse.\n\n1175\n00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,732\nI think I said this earlier.\n\n1176\n00:54:04,732 --> 00:54:07,330\nI'm gonna be sitting in my little cubicle,\ndown in the basement,\n\n1177\n00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,150\nwhere they've kicked me down\nto with my little red stapler.\n\n1178\n00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:13,020\nAnd I'm gonna be sitting at my machine,\n\n1179\n00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,090\nand I need to pull the log\nfiles from the server.\n\n1180\n00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,890\nServers usually not going to be\nsitting at the domain controller\n\n1181\n00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,040\npulling the events back, from the client\nmachines or anything like that.\n\n1182\n00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,470\nBut, it doesn't matter for\n\n1183\n00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:27,560\nthis demo it just shows us what\nwe can do with those event logs.\n\n1184\n00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,430\nVery cool feature.\n\n1185\n00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,290\nBeing able to set up those events.\n\n1186\n00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,050\nWe went member to summarize,\n\n1187\n00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,400\nwe had a few things we had to\ndo to get that to work right?\n\n1188\n00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,950\nHad a command, what was that\ncommand we had to run on the?\n\n1189\n00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:43,740\nCollectee, the source was\n>> Nice.\n\n1190\n00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,650\n>> And then we had to go to the collector,\n\n1191\n00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:51,370\nand we had to run-\n>> WECU2 QC.\n\n1192\n00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:56,220\n>> Beautiful and then we had to make\nsure that we added the collector to the-\n\n1193\n00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,110\n>> Local administrators group, or\n\n1194\n00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,010\nthe event log readers group.\n\n1195\n00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,070\n>> Exactly.\n\n1196\n00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,280\nTo give it permission to\nread those log files.\n\n1197\n00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,290\nAnd then you just have to pick\nwhich events you wanna see.\n\n1198\n00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,998\nAl of them, some of them.\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n1199\n00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:09,556\n>> Yep.\n\n1200\n00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,929\n>> And remember more than ten logs, and\n\n1201\n00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:12,447\nit will tell you that you're gonna run-\n\n1202\n00:55:12,447 --> 00:55:13,009\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1203\n00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,942\n>> You're gonna run out of memory, or\nblue screen, or something like that.\n\n1204\n00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:17,340\nSo, [LAUGH] limit what\nyou're pulling back.\n\n1205\n00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,797\n>> All right, sweet, Mike.\n\n1206\n00:55:18,797 --> 00:55:19,911\n>> Beautiful.\n\n1207\n00:55:19,911 --> 00:55:21,548\n>> Yep.\nThat's pretty awesome stuff.\n\n1208\n00:55:21,548 --> 00:55:24,552\n>> In the end, I hope you guys\ngot excited about event logs,\n\n1209\n00:55:24,552 --> 00:55:26,566\nevent logs are not an exciting thing.\n\n1210\n00:55:26,566 --> 00:55:29,520\nI mean really, they're not.\n\n1211\n00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,035\nBut, with these new features,\nit's almost exciting right?\n\n1212\n00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,440\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and\n\n1213\n00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,520\nevent logs they tell the tale.\n\n1214\n00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,160\n>> They do.\n\n1215\n00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,280\n>> Right?\nEverything I guess and\n\n1216\n00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,430\ncertain auditing turned on.\n\n1217\n00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,320\nBut yeah, it catches everything in there.\n\n1218\n00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,080\n>> Absolutely, I mean that's where\nyou go to find when somebody,\n\n1219\n00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,820\nwhen your trying to figure out what's\nbeen going on on your machine.\n\n1220\n00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,520\nHow many times have you had\nsomebody come up to you and\n\n1221\n00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,380\nsay, my computer's doing this,\nI dont know what the problem is?\n\n1222\n00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,419\nHave you checked your event logs?\n\n1223\n00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,470\n>> Event who?\n\n1224\n00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,347\n>> What?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1225\n00:56:03,347 --> 00:56:06,285\n>> And you go in the event log and\nit's telling you right there,\n\n1226\n00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:09,232\nI can't start this service\nbecause I have a password issue.\n\n1227\n00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,590\nOr something like that.\n\n1228\n00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,912\nSo, check your vent logs when you\nhave problems with your systems.\n\n1229\n00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:14,329\nIt's trying to tell you what's wrong.\n\n1230\n00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,108\n>> Yep.\n\n1231\n00:56:15,108 --> 00:56:16,449\n>> All right, beautiful.\n\n1232\n00:56:16,449 --> 00:56:18,249\nSo what's next on our list?\n\n1233\n00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,371\n>> Moving on we are going\nto hit Task Manager,\n\n1234\n00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:26,620\nwhich is one of my favorite tools\nthat's been revamped for Windows 8.\n\n1235\n00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,335\nA lot of great stuff in there and\n\n1236\n00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:33,030\nsometimes I just open up task manager and\nI just leave it open.\n\n1237\n00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,960\n>> Do you now?\n>> Because, yeah, I do.\n\n1238\n00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,202\nI turn it on.\n\n1239\n00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:39,300\n>> So I'm playing with event\nviewer on Friday night.\n\n1240\n00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,750\nNate is at home on Friday night,\nwatching task manager.\n\n1241\n00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,920\n>> Well yeah, I open it up.\n\n1242\n00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,025\n>> We are just wild and\ncrazy guys, aren't we?\n\n1243\n00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:47,570\n>> Play.\n\n1244\n00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,142\nWell yeah, I play games, and\ndo things and [CROSSTALK]\n\n1245\n00:56:50,142 --> 00:56:51,053\n>> Oh, and watch what's going on yeah?\n\n1246\n00:56:51,053 --> 00:56:52,557\n>> Yeah, all the meters move up and down.\n\n1247\n00:56:52,557 --> 00:56:54,320\n>> All right, well let's take a look.\n\n1248\n00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,280\nYou guide me through.\n\n1249\n00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,699\nI'll pull up, which machine\ndo you want me to go over to?\n\n1250\n00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:57,274\nDoes it matter?\n\n1251\n00:56:57,274 --> 00:56:59,322\n>> You can just use your\nreal machine if you want.\n\n1252\n00:56:59,322 --> 00:57:00,192\n>> That would do.\nAll right.\n\n1253\n00:57:00,192 --> 00:57:01,012\nI don't know.\n\n1254\n00:57:01,012 --> 00:57:02,736\nWhat do I got running on my laptop?\n\n1255\n00:57:02,736 --> 00:57:05,847\nI might not want you to see\nwhat's going on out here.\n\n1256\n00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:10,473\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nI'm gonna pull up my task manager.\n\n1257\n00:57:10,473 --> 00:57:14,719\nAll I did there was right click on\nthe task bar, and choose Task Manager.\n\n1258\n00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:19,907\nBut you guys know I could go over\nto my Start screen on Windows 8.\n\n1259\n00:57:19,907 --> 00:57:21,380\nIf I can get to my start screen.\n\n1260\n00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,340\nAnd I can type in task, and\nthere is my good old task manager there.\n\n1261\n00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,760\nA couple of different\nways you can get to it.\n\n1262\n00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,734\nAnd I'll start out.\nThis is really the default view, isn't it?\n\n1263\n00:57:29,734 --> 00:57:31,400\n>> Yep.\n\n1264\n00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,310\nNow this right here will show\nthe desktop style apps that are,\n\n1265\n00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,940\nyeah, the desktop apps that are running.\n\n1266\n00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:46,625\nIt will not show like Windows\nbuilt-in tools and that kinda thing.\n\n1267\n00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:49,098\nIt won't show up in this view.\n\n1268\n00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:49,676\n>> Yep.\nSo\n\n1269\n00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:54,206\nit's just stuff that we have\ndesktop apps open and running.\n\n1270\n00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:55,930\n>> That's actually a pretty lame view,\nisn't it?\n\n1271\n00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,689\nHonestly it's like that.\n\n1272\n00:57:57,689 --> 00:57:59,005\nThat's task manager.\n\n1273\n00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:02,557\n[SOUND] All right so\nI'm gonna click on more details,\n\n1274\n00:58:02,557 --> 00:58:06,927\nI'm sure that that's gonna give\nme more information, right?\n\n1275\n00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:07,896\n>> Yep.\nAnd wham.\n\n1276\n00:58:07,896 --> 00:58:09,180\nRight in your face.\n\n1277\n00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:09,841\n>> Ta-da.\n\n1278\n00:58:09,841 --> 00:58:11,475\n[NOISE] All right.\n\n1279\n00:58:11,475 --> 00:58:13,707\n>> So we have a number of things here.\n\n1280\n00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:18,351\nAnd I think what we'll do, let's just\nkind of briefly go through each tab and\n\n1281\n00:58:18,351 --> 00:58:21,060\nwhat we could expect to see on it.\n\n1282\n00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,169\nThe first tab here is the processes tab,\nand\n\n1283\n00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:27,204\nthis will contain the desktop style apps.\n\n1284\n00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:31,964\nThe Windows built in tools\nthat are running, and the CPU,\n\n1285\n00:58:31,964 --> 00:58:36,628\nthe memory, the disk, and\nthe network utilization that\n\n1286\n00:58:36,628 --> 00:58:40,827\nthose individual items\nare indeed using on the PC.\n\n1287\n00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:45,972\nAnd it's more or\nless pretty close to real time.\n\n1288\n00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:50,710\nAnd it's like you have to wait for\nthings to refresh, improve or get better.\n\n1289\n00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,100\nIt's pretty quick on it.\n\n1290\n00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:58,504\nClicking at the top of the different\ncolumns, you can sort quickly by things.\n\n1291\n00:58:58,504 --> 00:59:02,558\nThey're clicking on name,\nsorts by name and ascending and\n\n1292\n00:59:02,558 --> 00:59:05,407\ndescending, a quick way to find things.\n\n1293\n00:59:05,407 --> 00:59:06,312\n>> Nice.\n\n1294\n00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:09,950\n>> Now if there was a particular app that.\n\n1295\n00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:13,890\nSo if you're computer is running\nreally slow, let's say like CPU.\n\n1296\n00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:14,523\n>> Okay.\n\n1297\n00:59:14,523 --> 00:59:21,863\n>> Clicking on CPU will drag the apps\nthat are using the most I guess CPU time.\n\n1298\n00:59:21,863 --> 00:59:22,890\n>> Right.\nYeah.\n\n1299\n00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,341\n>> Up there at the top of the list.\n\n1300\n00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:28,020\nAnd so you don't have to really go\nthrough and filter out every single one.\n\n1301\n00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,468\n>> The only thing that gets me on\nthis view cuz it is like you say,\n\n1302\n00:59:30,468 --> 00:59:32,679\nyou click on that and\nyou're sorting it ascending, so\n\n1303\n00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:36,206\nyou're seeing what's using the most up at\nthe top, but it's a dynamic view, right?\n\n1304\n00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:40,226\nIt's changing, so as applications reduce\nor increase the amount of CPU you're\n\n1305\n00:59:40,226 --> 00:59:42,959\nusing, they start jumping\naround on you in that list.\n\n1306\n00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:44,960\nAnd you're like, wait, what, oh.\n\n1307\n00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,690\nAnd sometimes it's hard\nto get the one you want.\n\n1308\n00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,840\nI don't know, maybe that's just me.\n\n1309\n00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,775\nSo I'll usually use this to figure out\nwhich one is taking up all the resources,\n\n1310\n00:59:52,775 --> 00:59:56,065\ncuzbyou can see IVGA is gonna bounce\naround [INAUDIBLE] the top, and\n\n1311\n00:59:56,065 --> 00:59:56,728\ndown there.\n\n1312\n00:59:56,728 --> 00:59:57,750\n>> 40 megabits.\n\n1313\n00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,025\nThat thing's using.\n\n1314\n00:59:59,025 --> 00:59:59,642\n>> Which one is it?\n\n1315\n00:59:59,642 --> 01:00:00,524\nIVGA was?\n\n1316\n01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:01,244\n>> Look at that.\n\n1317\n01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:02,097\n40 megs.\n\n1318\n01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:02,713\n>> Yeah.\n\n1319\n01:00:02,713 --> 01:00:03,356\nI know, right?\n\n1320\n01:00:03,356 --> 01:00:04,330\n>> That's a lot.\n\n1321\n01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,267\n>> And\nit is sucking up all my processors or\n\n1322\n01:00:06,267 --> 01:00:08,333\nall my network [INAUDIBLE] that's doing.\n\n1323\n01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,987\n30, 40 megabytes per second.\n\n1324\n01:00:09,987 --> 01:00:10,928\n>> Yeah.\nAlmost half.\n\n1325\n01:00:10,928 --> 01:00:12,066\n>> Yeah.\n>> Nice.\n\n1326\n01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:12,623\n>> Yep.\n\n1327\n01:00:12,623 --> 01:00:13,366\n>> All right.\n\n1328\n01:00:13,366 --> 01:00:13,968\n>> Yep.\n\n1329\n01:00:13,968 --> 01:00:14,526\nSo yeah.\n\n1330\n01:00:14,526 --> 01:00:17,205\nSo there we go on that one.\n\n1331\n01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:22,685\nThe next tab that we have, the performance\ntab, and in this view here I guess it,\n\n1332\n01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:29,990\nkind of how on the processes tab we\ncould see in columns and percents.\n\n1333\n01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:35,870\nThis gives us just a pretty high level\nview of what exactly is being consumed.\n\n1334\n01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:36,970\n>> It's a nice graphical view.\n\n1335\n01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,580\nAnd for those of you that were\nmessing around with computers before\n\n1336\n01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:44,630\nWindows Vista, before Windows 7,\nWindows 8, this has changed a lot, right?\n\n1337\n01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:47,630\nBack then all you got to see was\nyour percent processor time and\n\n1338\n01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,680\nyour page file utilization I think.\n\n1339\n01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,030\nNot a whole lot of stuff, but\nhere you get these nice graphs.\n\n1340\n01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:58,270\nI can take a look at my bluetooth and\nmy wi-fi, my disk, my memory.\n\n1341\n01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:00,226\nIt is very nice.\n\n1342\n01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:02,763\nSo, yep.\n\n1343\n01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:05,860\nThat's our performance tab.\n\n1344\n01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,570\n>> Well on the CPU, right,\nin that little bar graph,\n\n1345\n01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:14,519\nif you right click on that and\nchoose change graph to logical processors.\n\n1346\n01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:20,930\n>> So Mike's laptop here,\nright, is a quad core i7.\n\n1347\n01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:27,090\nAnd so we have the individual\ncores that are being used.\n\n1348\n01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:28,231\n>> Well this guy's slacking down here.\n\n1349\n01:01:28,231 --> 01:01:29,880\nHe's taking the day off.\n\n1350\n01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,808\n[LAUGH] It very well could be that\nsome applications aren't really\n\n1351\n01:01:34,808 --> 01:01:38,136\nwritten to take advantage\nof all the cores.\n\n1352\n01:01:38,136 --> 01:01:41,747\nLike on mine, at the house,\nit's a eight core processor.\n\n1353\n01:01:41,747 --> 01:01:42,362\nEight?\n\n1354\n01:01:42,362 --> 01:01:46,600\n>> Eight core.\n\n1355\n01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,490\nAnd there will be some\napplications that run,\n\n1356\n01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:52,660\nthat would just completely\npeg one of those cores.\n\n1357\n01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:57,180\nAnd the guy is spiked, clear the top, and\nthe other seven are just like the one guy,\n\n1358\n01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:57,970\ntaking the day off.\n\n1359\n01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:58,800\n>> Yah, absolutely.\n\n1360\n01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,200\nThey are on a picnic or something.\n\n1361\n01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,520\nThat's true and\nyou're seeing it more and more.\n\n1362\n01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,520\nNow, applications are being written\n>> To take advantage of\n\n1363\n01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,750\nmultiple processors for the most part\nbecause they're more common out there.\n\n1364\n01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,020\nBut yeah,\na lot of my older apps do the same thing.\n\n1365\n01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:17,290\nThey just sit on one processor and they\ndon't split that work load very nicely.\n\n1366\n01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,800\n>> On the next tab here, the app history.\n\n1367\n01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:24,930\nNow this will do our are Windows 8 style,\nmodern apps.\n\n1368\n01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:32,126\nAnd so those apps, how much CPU time they\nare using, their network, metered network.\n\n1369\n01:02:32,126 --> 01:02:35,412\nMetered network is going\nto be their costed network.\n\n1370\n01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:40,433\nMobile broadband, those sorts of things.\n\n1371\n01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:45,020\nI guess we are on a laptop so\nit includes it.\n\n1372\n01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,630\nDesktops wouldn't.\n\n1373\n01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,603\n>> You might not see that meter thing?\n\n1374\n01:02:47,603 --> 01:02:49,680\n>> Yep.\nWouldn't quite get that.\n\n1375\n01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,420\n>> It's great that they throw\nthat in there, right though?\n\n1376\n01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,570\nBecause on some of my\nconnections where I am paying\n\n1377\n01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:58,160\nby the amount of data that I'm sending and\nreceiving up there.\n\n1378\n01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,015\nThe amount of bandwidth I'm using,\nit's nice to track these apps,\n\n1379\n01:03:01,015 --> 01:03:06,480\ncuz I've got that new Windows style\napp sitting on my start screen,\n\n1380\n01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,280\nand I didn't realize\nthat it's a live tile.\n\n1381\n01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,380\nAnd it's checking every so often and\npulling down these statistics,\n\n1382\n01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,610\nand all of a sudden my bill is\ngoing up and I'm like, why?\n\n1383\n01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:20,190\nWell because I've got 50 different live\ntiles out there all pulling down data.\n\n1384\n01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:22,929\nSo it's nice that I can see which\nones maybe are using the most and\n\n1385\n01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:25,618\ndecide maybe to turn off the live\npart of that particular tile so\n\n1386\n01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:27,053\nit doesn't update all the time.\n\n1387\n01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,167\nVery handy.\n\n1388\n01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:30,110\nUpdate all the time.\n\n1389\n01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,840\nYeah that's just our\nlast little column there.\n\n1390\n01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,390\nIs yeah the amount of updates that\nthese guys are sitting back there\n\n1391\n01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,600\nlike [INAUDIBLE] weather's\nchannel 1.7 megabytes.\n\n1392\n01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,760\nYeah, yeah.\n\n1393\n01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,390\n>> Weather Channel.\n\n1394\n01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,230\nThat's Weather Channel.\n\n1395\n01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:47,280\nI think that's the built-in weather app,\nisn't it?\n\n1396\n01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:49,310\n>> Yeah, he's taking his time.\n\n1397\n01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,540\n>> Do I have Weather Channel on this guy?\n\n1398\n01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,920\nYeah, it's this guy here.\n\n1399\n01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,860\nWhich I don't know if\nyou guys [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1400\n01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:55,818\nIt is a great-looking app.\n>> It is.\n\n1401\n01:03:55,818 --> 01:03:58,226\n>> [LAUGH] But\nwe're not here to learn about that, so\n\n1402\n01:03:58,226 --> 01:04:00,155\nlet's get back over to Task Manager.\n\n1403\n01:04:00,155 --> 01:04:04,307\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now, I did skip over one thing.\n\n1404\n01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:06,240\nLet's get back over to processes.\n\n1405\n01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,230\n>> Okay.\n\n1406\n01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:09,333\n>> I was getting a little ahead of myself.\n\n1407\n01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:13,092\nHover your mouse over the name part, and\n\n1408\n01:04:13,092 --> 01:04:18,853\nif you right-click,\nwe can add columns of what we wanna see.\n\n1409\n01:04:18,853 --> 01:04:20,432\nOne thing I think is kind of neat.\n\n1410\n01:04:20,432 --> 01:04:23,490\nI've never use it but\nI think it's kind of cool to look at.\n\n1411\n01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,740\nAnd it's the command line.\n\n1412\n01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:30,239\nYou can see the command line\nthing of where they are.\n\n1413\n01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,470\nI don't really have a use for\n\n1414\n01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:35,620\nit but it's kind of neat to see\nwhere these guys are coming.\n\n1415\n01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:36,682\n>> It looks techy, geeky, right.\n\n1416\n01:04:36,682 --> 01:04:38,050\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Like oh yeah,\n\n1417\n01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,940\nthis is in sequel and slash so and so.\n\n1418\n01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:43,000\n>> Well what's cool about it\nhere is you can actually see.\n\n1419\n01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,850\nLike let's find me an example of one.\n\n1420\n01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,190\nI've got anything that's really exciting\nnot many some of these serve as hosts, but\n\n1421\n01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:56,660\nyou can see the command to launch this was\nC call on Windows system 32 service

information than that,\nwe've got this new console.\n\n1583\n01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,360\nI say new,\nit was really there in Windows 7.\n\n1584\n01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,010\nWe don't count Windows Vista.\n\n1585\n01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,075\nWe pretend like that never happened.\n\n1586\n01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:48,865\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's not new to Windows 8, or\n\n1587\n01:13:48,865 --> 01:13:51,480\nanything, but\nit is new to the new kernels.\n\n1588\n01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,309\nAnd that's Resource Monitor.\n\n1589\n01:13:54,309 --> 01:14:01,404\nAnd Resource Monitor is more information\nthan you would ever need, don't you think?\n\n1590\n01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:01,935\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1591\n01:14:01,935 --> 01:14:04,315\nYep.\n\n1592\n01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:06,010\nYeah.\n\n1593\n01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:09,900\nJust more stuff of our details.\n\n1594\n01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:13,890\n>> It really is, you've got the same views\nover here, where I've got my CPU disk.\n\n1595\n01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,030\nMy four main sub systems,\nCPU disk, memory network.\n\n1596\n01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:19,020\nMy nice little graph view.\n\n1597\n01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:22,410\nI can change the view a little to small,\nmedium, large.\n\n1598\n01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:24,410\nNot all that handy there, but\n\n1599\n01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:29,440\non this overview tab, I've got a section\nfor each one of my main subsystems.\n\n1600\n01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:37,400\nCPU disc, network, and\nif I could scroll down here, memory.\n\n1601\n01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,040\nAnd this is kind of the high\nlevel overview, for\n\n1602\n01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,870\neach one of those four categories.\n\n1603\n01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,840\nBut then we have a tab,\nfor each one of these, so\n\n1604\n01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,880\nI can go to the CPU tab, and\nthen holy smokes, right?\n\n1605\n01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,382\n>> And in my head,\nI was thinking of the but wait--\n\n1606\n01:14:57,382 --> 01:14:58,111\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1607\n01:14:58,111 --> 01:14:59,020\n>> There's more.\n\n1608\n01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,500\n>> That's right, I was waiting for that.\n\n1609\n01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,496\n>> If you click now,\n\n1610\n01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:05,826\nyou will also get to see every single\nprocess that application has launched.\n\n1611\n01:15:05,826 --> 01:15:08,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Every, [LAUGH], I mean,\n\n1612\n01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,780\nit's just ungodly.\n\n1613\n01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:13,350\nEvery handle associated which\nuse one of those processes.\n\n1614\n01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:17,980\nEvery module of those guys are connecting,\nit's amazing.\n\n1615\n01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,790\nIf I click on something up here,\nlet's see what we got, task manager.\n\n1616\n01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,640\nAnd I'm not seeing a lot of detail down\nthere, but the memory tab is really cool.\n\n1617\n01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,050\nI love this graphical view\nof what you get there.\n\n1618\n01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:34,720\nThe disk tab, again,\nyou get disk activity and storage.\n\n1619\n01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,930\nAnd then on network, network activity.\n\n1620\n01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:40,430\nNow here's a cool feature.\n\n1621\n01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:42,090\nLet's go back out to the overview.\n\n1622\n01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,420\nLet's say I'm trying to figure out.\n\n1623\n01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:47,200\nI can see my overall\nutilization over here, but\n\n1624\n01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,090\nI wanna know what is task manager using?\n\n1625\n01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:52,250\nWhat task manager doing?\n\n1626\n01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:56,660\nI can come over here and I can select put\na little check mark next to task manager.\n\n1627\n01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:02,160\nAnd what that's gonna do, is it's gonna\nfilter everything else, by task manager.\n\n1628\n01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,070\nWhen I go to CPU, I'm seeing the services\nthat task manager's using, and\n\n1629\n01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:09,900\nthe handles that task manager is using.\n\n1630\n01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:13,990\nWhen I look at my memory, I'm seeing,\n\n1631\n01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:16,260\nif it's actually filtering\nthat down too much.\n\n1632\n01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:20,790\nDisk, yeah and here's any processes, if\ntask manager was writing to the drive then\n\n1633\n01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:25,280\nI would see it there it's a really\ncool way to filter the view down.\n\n1634\n01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,500\nLet's find another one that might\nbe doing something exciting here.\n\n1635\n01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,380\niVGA?\n\n1636\n01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:34,450\n>> Well let's find iVGA,\ncuz he is sucking up a lot.\n\n1637\n01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,900\nThere's good old iVGA Pro,\nyou see my graph over here?\n\n1638\n01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:42,790\nI get this orange line, you can barely see\nthat on your screen there at home, but\n\n1639\n01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:47,870\nthat orange line is showing me the green\nis my overall CPU utilization, and\n\n1640\n01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:51,140\nthen that orange line is showing\nme what percentage of that overall\n\n1641\n01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,170\niVGA happens to be using.\n\n1642\n01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,310\nAnd then again, my other screens,\n\n1643\n01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,530\neverything should be filtered\nby what I have selected.\n\n1644\n01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,850\nNow I'm seeing handles from just iVGA.\n\n1645\n01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:04,430\nAnd I'm seeing services.\n\n1646\n01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:05,915\nJust from iVGA.\n\n1647\n01:17:05,915 --> 01:17:11,270\nMemory-wise, again that one\ndoesn't seem to get filtered much.\n\n1648\n01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:15,290\nDisk, network, there I can see what\nnetwork is doing, really cool,\n\n1649\n01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:18,660\nI've used that to trace down what it is.\n\n1650\n01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,930\nI was actually using it to compare\ntwo different copy processes,\n\n1651\n01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:24,710\none from a USB drive and one.\n\n1652\n01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:25,760\nWhat was I doing?\n\n1653\n01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,400\nI was doing one from a USB drive and\nanother one over the network.\n\n1654\n01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,394\nTrying to see which one was using more,\nbut, kind of fun.\n\n1655\n01:17:31,394 --> 01:17:34,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know, again, me on a Friday night,\n\n1656\n01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,620\nmy exciting life.\n\n1657\n01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:38,410\nSo yes, that is Resource Monitor,\n\n1658\n01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:42,967\nI like to call Resource Monitor\ntask manager on steroids.\n\n1659\n01:17:42,967 --> 01:17:44,610\nIt's really what it's kind of like.\n\n1660\n01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:50,348\n>> So you're taking two things, racing\nthem against each other, see who wins?\n\n1661\n01:17:50,348 --> 01:17:52,895\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1662\n01:17:52,895 --> 01:17:57,471\n[LAUGH] What you gotta see is that USB\n3 port really faster than USB 2, or\n\n1663\n01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:58,860\nis it a bunch of hype?\n\n1664\n01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:02,666\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's awesome.\n\n1665\n01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:05,585\n>> It is, it is pretty cool.\n\n1666\n01:18:05,585 --> 01:18:06,935\n>> Have you documented this stuff?\n\n1667\n01:18:06,935 --> 01:18:07,862\n>> No, no.\n\n1668\n01:18:07,862 --> 01:18:08,725\n>> Oh, man.\n>> I should.\n\n1669\n01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:10,055\nI should shoot that video for you guys.\n\n1670\n01:18:10,055 --> 01:18:12,345\nOr do a little screen capture.\n\n1671\n01:18:12,345 --> 01:18:16,140\nAll right, tell you what, we are Just\nabout out of time for this segment,\n\n1672\n01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,440\nso why don't we take a quick break.\n\n1673\n01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:22,250\nWe'll come back, and\nwe're gonna move on to, well, we'll see.\n\n1674\n01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,060\nWe'll let you guys wait in anticipation.\n\n1675\n01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:25,940\n>> Oh man, I almost said it, too.\n\n1676\n01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:28,200\n>> Did you?\n[LAUGH] >> Almost gave away the secret.\n\n1677\n01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,208\nAll right, you guys enjoy.\n\n1678\n01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:35,400\nSee you back here in a few.\n\n1679\n01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,110\nAll right.\n\n1680\n01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:41,478\nAnd welcome back, sure.\n\n1681\n01:18:41,478 --> 01:18:48,350\nAll right, we've got a yep\na few more items to cover on.\n\n1682\n01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,717\n>> Yep.\n\n1683\n01:18:49,717 --> 01:18:52,620\n>> Oh that's right because we didn't\nsay it, yep when we came back.\n\n1684\n01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:53,380\nThat's right.\n\n1685\n01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:56,960\n>> We've got a performance monitor.\n\n1686\n01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,210\nAnd we've got the-\n>> Reliability monitor.\n\n1687\n01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:01,910\n>> Reliability monitor.\n\n1688\n01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:03,190\n>> Which is why I, right when we cut back.\n\n1689\n01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:06,400\nI was talking about, wait I should do\nthat on my machine cuz we have a virtual\n\n1690\n01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,270\nmachines don't have a lot of history,\nright?\n\n1691\n01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:09,460\nAnd we wanted something cool to look at.\n\n1692\n01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,825\nSo [SOUND] and we'll explain as we go.\n\n1693\n01:19:11,825 --> 01:19:15,090\nWhat just died on my machine.\n\n1694\n01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:19,960\n>> And last we've got the, Mike,\n\n1695\n01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:25,125\nI was like let's start indexing yeah like,\nlets start, but I blinked.\n\n1696\n01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:27,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was a little too fast.\n\n1697\n01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,610\n>> All right, when we left off,\nwith that last segment there,\n\n1698\n01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,750\nwe talked about task manager, and\nwe talked about, the performance monitor.\n\n1699\n01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:41,810\nI'm sorry, we talked about task manager,\nand we talked about, the Resource Monitor.\n\n1700\n01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,520\nResource Monitor and Task Manager.\n\n1701\n01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,390\nThose two guys are what we\ncall real-time monitoring.\n\n1702\n01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:50,140\nThat means what you're seeing is what's\ngoing on in that machine right now.\n\n1703\n01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:54,040\nIn fact,\nif I flip back over just to show you guys.\n\n1704\n01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,740\nLet's see, did I leave that open?\n\n1705\n01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:00,540\nOf course not,\nlet's just get Task Manager back out here.\n\n1706\n01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,239\nThat's an easy one.\n\n1707\n01:20:03,239 --> 01:20:06,280\nWhen we look at this performance,\nall right, that's real time.\n\n1708\n01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,113\nAs you see,\nthose graphs are gonna slide across.\n\n1709\n01:20:09,113 --> 01:20:12,712\nAnd when that data gets to the far\nleft of those boxes, it's gone, right?\n\n1710\n01:20:12,712 --> 01:20:17,822\nI have no way to save the information, no\nway to keep it and reference it later on.\n\n1711\n01:20:17,822 --> 01:20:20,609\nSo that's what they mean\nby real time monitoring.\n\n1712\n01:20:20,609 --> 01:20:25,415\nOn the exam, we got to know the difference\nbetween our real time monitoring tools\n\n1713\n01:20:25,415 --> 01:20:28,350\nversus our historical monitoring tools.\n\n1714\n01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:29,600\nAnd that's where we're going to go next.\n\n1715\n01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,560\nOur historical monitoring tools is going\nto be perfmon, or performance monitor.\n\n1716\n01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,580\nSo I'm going to come over here and\ntype in perfmon, if I could spell.\n\n1717\n01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:42,520\nPerfmon, perdmon does\nhave an F in it [LAUGH].\n\n1718\n01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,730\nPerfmon for performance monitor.\n\n1719\n01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:50,100\nAnd there she is,\nwhat a beautiful console it is, right?\n\n1720\n01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:53,520\n>> But I don't have any like cool\ngraphs or anything on there,\n\n1721\n01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,080\nlike Task Manager or Reliability.\n\n1722\n01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,260\n>> It looks lame, doesn't it?\n\n1723\n01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,874\nBut wait, there's more, if you click now.\n\n1724\n01:20:58,874 --> 01:21:00,571\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n1725\n01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:07,340\nPerformance Monitor whereas Task Manager,\nReliability Monitor, real time monitoring.\n\n1726\n01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:10,920\nPerformance Monitor does both,\nit does real time monitoring and\n\n1727\n01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,200\nhistorical monitoring.\n\n1728\n01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,220\nIf I come over here to my performance\nmonitor node in this performance monitor\n\n1729\n01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:20,350\nconsole, this again is\nreal time monitoring.\n\n1730\n01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:22,710\nSo what I'm seeing as\nthis bar moves across,\n\n1731\n01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:25,370\nthe default is there's\none counter down here.\n\n1732\n01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:29,730\nPercent processor time, and I'm seeing\nwhat's going on right now on my machine.\n\n1733\n01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:34,048\nBut when that bar gets to the end, it's\ngoing to flip around to the beginning and\n\n1734\n01:21:34,048 --> 01:21:36,188\nwipe out the old data with the new data.\n\n1735\n01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:38,441\nAll right.\nAnd I probably should talk about adding\n\n1736\n01:21:38,441 --> 01:21:39,032\ncounters?\n\n1737\n01:21:39,032 --> 01:21:41,029\n>> Yeah, sure, let's move into that.\n\n1738\n01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:44,820\nNow, yeap, so\nMike's got one little process here right.\n\n1739\n01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,184\nNot a whole lot going on.\n\n1740\n01:21:46,184 --> 01:21:51,860\nThat little green plus button up\nthere will let us add counters.\n\n1741\n01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:58,060\nOr let us add more things that we can\nput on this graph to track their usage.\n\n1742\n01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:01,168\nAnd there are hundreds, if not a thousand,\n\n1743\n01:22:01,168 --> 01:22:05,270\ndifferent counters and things and\nstuff that we can add.\n\n1744\n01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:09,711\n>> Yeah, each one of these that you see\nhere is actually a category not a counter,\n\n1745\n01:22:09,711 --> 01:22:14,220\nso if I expand this out, you'll see that\neach one of those categories has dozens\n\n1746\n01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,060\nof counters underneath there.\n\n1747\n01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:19,070\nSo it's not like they expect you\nto memorize all these counters or\n\n1748\n01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:20,595\nanything like that.\n\n1749\n01:22:20,595 --> 01:22:24,461\nThere are a few that we should\nreally know, there's a couple.\n\n1750\n01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:27,816\nOur core processes that we should\nmonitor if we're looking at our\n\n1751\n01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:31,969\nmachines performance, again remember\nyou've got your four main subsystems.\n\n1752\n01:22:31,969 --> 01:22:35,400\nProcessor, disk, memory, and network.\n\n1753\n01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:39,120\nAnd for processor we're typically\nlooking at percent processor time.\n\n1754\n01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:43,010\nBecause that really is how\nbusy my processor is, right?\n\n1755\n01:22:43,010 --> 01:22:43,843\nSo that's a good one.\n\n1756\n01:22:43,843 --> 01:22:45,442\nFor memory.\n\n1757\n01:22:45,442 --> 01:22:48,470\n>> Where did that one go?\n\n1758\n01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,270\n>> We'll go down here to our.\n\n1759\n01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:52,070\nWhat's that?\n\n1760\n01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:53,225\n>> I can't remember!\n\n1761\n01:22:53,225 --> 01:22:55,440\n>> [LAUGH] He's so clever.\n\n1762\n01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,790\nWe come down here to memory,\nand a good one to monitor for\n\n1763\n01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:02,000\nthis one is gonna be,\ntypically pages per second.\n\n1764\n01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,615\nSo I'm going to select that guy,\nand I'm going to click Add.\n\n1765\n01:23:04,615 --> 01:23:08,870\nAnd it's going to dump it over\nhere to the right hand side.\n\n1766\n01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:12,360\nAnd while I'm here, as you're going\nthrough these counters, a lot of these,\n\n1767\n01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,690\nyou're going to go, I don't know what\nthe heck net pool non page bytes is.\n\n1768\n01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:18,770\nWell, there's a handy little\ncheck mark down here,\n\n1769\n01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:21,570\nShow Description and you can check that.\n\n1770\n01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:23,390\nAnd now whatever counter\nyou have selected,\n\n1771\n01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:26,490\nit's going to tell you, give a little\nidea of what the heck that counter is.\n\n1772\n01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:29,040\nSo, great way to learn what\nthese different counters are.\n\n1773\n01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,940\nJust thumb through here and click on\nthem and see what that description says.\n\n1774\n01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:37,250\nSo we'll do pages per second for\nmemory and then for my\n\n1775\n01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:44,050\nphysical disk is do you have differentiate\nbetween physical disk and logical disk,\n\n1776\n01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:47,970\nphysical disk being my hard drive logical\nbeing my volumes on those drives there.\n\n1777\n01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:53,550\nA good one to monitor for that one is\naverage disk queue length, all right?\n\n1778\n01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:59,830\nNow when you add these counters like this,\nI have more than one drive in here.\n\n1779\n01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:04,040\nSo I can see D, C, and E it looks like.\n\n1780\n01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:08,940\nTotal would take all my drives performance\ninformation, add it all up, and\n\n1781\n01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,540\nshow me one counter for\nall of them together.\n\n1782\n01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:16,350\nAll instances is a way to add each\none without having to add each one\n\n1783\n01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:18,960\nindividually, and\nthen you can pick an individual instance.\n\n1784\n01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,500\nAnd I only have one drive,\nI don't know why it says I have two.\n\n1785\n01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,170\nI have one drive.\n\n1786\n01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:25,520\nDisc zero has three volumes on it.\n\n1787\n01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,870\nI'll just do a total even\nthough there is only one.\n\n1788\n01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:30,570\nAnd then last but\nnot least is going to be for\n\n1789\n01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:34,620\nmemory, oh no wait,\nwe did memory, I forgot.\n\n1790\n01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,540\n>> Oh, [LAUGH] network.\n\n1791\n01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:38,450\n>> Network would be\nthe one we'd want there.\n\n1792\n01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,370\nSo, Network Adapter.\n\n1793\n01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:48,140\nLet's do, it is tricky to scroll around\nin here, there's so many of them.\n\n1794\n01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:55,483\nLet's do Network Adapter,\ngo to bytes total per second.\n\n1795\n01:24:55,483 --> 01:24:57,266\nThat did not add I've locked it up here.\n\n1796\n01:24:57,266 --> 01:25:01,637\nGive it one second,\nit's thinking about it.\n\n1797\n01:25:01,637 --> 01:25:02,757\nThere it is.\n\n1798\n01:25:02,757 --> 01:25:03,326\n>> Oh, there it goes.\n\n1799\n01:25:03,326 --> 01:25:07,163\n>> Bytes total, and I've already\ngot percent processor time, so\n\n1800\n01:25:07,163 --> 01:25:08,877\nI'm just going to click OK.\n\n1801\n01:25:08,877 --> 01:25:13,898\nAnd now I've got, I forgot I did a total,\nthat was all of my different virtual\n\n1802\n01:25:13,898 --> 01:25:18,473\ntunnel adapters and stuff, so\nit does look a little messy down there.\n\n1803\n01:25:18,473 --> 01:25:22,110\nYeah, you know,\nmy graphics is not doing too well.\n\n1804\n01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:25,260\nI don't have a, what's going on?\n\n1805\n01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:28,490\nAlthough this is a good chance to show us.\n\n1806\n01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:32,140\nOne, you can see the old data's\ngetting wiped out by the new.\n\n1807\n01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,860\nTwo, when you've got counters that\nare running right along the bottom or\n\n1808\n01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:38,780\nright along the top,\nthey can be very difficult to see.\n\n1809\n01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:40,280\nThat's what this guy is for.\n\n1810\n01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,680\nThis is a highlighter.\n\n1811\n01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:45,390\nAnd if I select that,\nwhichever one I click on down here,\n\n1812\n01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,990\nis going to be highlighted, so I can see\noh there it is, it's buried at the bottom.\n\n1813\n01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:53,340\nAnd that was probably a mistake adding\nall those different virtual adapters.\n\n1814\n01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:56,290\nAverage disk queue length, there it was.\n\n1815\n01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,550\nIt was hiding right down\nthere at the bottom.\n\n1816\n01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:03,060\nSo that's handy having that\nlittle highlighter there.\n\n1817\n01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,110\nI can remove counter,\n\n1818\n01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:07,915\nyou can hide counters temporarily\nby just unchecking these boxes.\n\n1819\n01:26:07,915 --> 01:26:14,889\nYou can also delete counters by\nclicking on the little red X.\n\n1820\n01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:21,210\nAnd you can also,\nwell that's probably good for now.\n\n1821\n01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:22,990\nAll right, so\nthat's realtime monitoring again.\n\n1822\n01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:25,240\nAs that line moves off,\nit's wiping out my old data.\n\n1823\n01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:29,705\nSo Mike, where the heck is this historical\nmonitoring I keep talking about?\n\n1824\n01:26:29,705 --> 01:26:31,310\n>> And are you,\ndata collector sets or something?\n\n1825\n01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:32,767\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1826\n01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:34,809\nGo ahead.\n\n1827\n01:26:34,809 --> 01:26:40,780\n>> Yeah,\nin the the data collector sets, right?\n\n1828\n01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:45,870\nThere are some, and\nthese sets are just like groups of these\n\n1829\n01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:51,490\ncounters that it will record and save in\na little file that you can review later.\n\n1830\n01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:55,230\nLet's say a user says,\noh man my computer really, really slow,\n\n1831\n01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:57,820\nman this thing is terrible,\nI need a new one.\n\n1832\n01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:00,596\nAnd so you go down there and look at it,\nand what happens is every time?\n\n1833\n01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:03,313\nOh, it's not doing it right now,\nit's not doing it.\n\n1834\n01:27:03,313 --> 01:27:06,868\nYou can build data collector sets,\nand have them run on\n\n1835\n01:27:06,868 --> 01:27:11,350\nthe computer that will gather it\nbetween a certain amount of time.\n\n1836\n01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:14,966\nLet's say they're, oh,\nit's always slow at lunch time.\n\n1837\n01:27:14,966 --> 01:27:18,810\nAre you going to gather these collectors\nand find out well hey, holy cow man,\n\n1838\n01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:21,846\nyou're running Dungeons and\nDragons online during lunch.\n\n1839\n01:27:21,846 --> 01:27:23,234\nNo matter your computer is real slow.\n\n1840\n01:27:23,234 --> 01:27:24,534\n>> That's right.\nExactly\n\n1841\n01:27:24,534 --> 01:27:25,960\n>> And yep, and\n\n1842\n01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,768\nso it gives the option\nto save these things.\n\n1843\n01:27:30,768 --> 01:27:31,310\n>> Exactly so\n\n1844\n01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:35,537\nyou know there's a couple ways you can go\nabout creating your data collector sets.\n\n1845\n01:27:35,537 --> 01:27:38,973\nAs Nate points out this is what we\ncall the historical monitoring.\n\n1846\n01:27:38,973 --> 01:27:40,604\nThis is where I can save that information.\n\n1847\n01:27:40,604 --> 01:27:44,661\nIn our studies for our exam we\nwant to learn the term baseline.\n\n1848\n01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:45,283\nRight?\n\n1849\n01:27:45,283 --> 01:27:50,600\nBaseline, when we talk about performance,\nperformance is relative, right?\n\n1850\n01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,900\nPerformance depends on your point of view.\n\n1851\n01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:56,389\nWe could take a laptop, and\nI get that laptop and I get on there and\n\n1852\n01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:58,653\nI'm like wow this thing is smoking fast,\n\n1853\n01:27:58,653 --> 01:28:02,617\nbecause compared to the old 386\nthat I've got, this thing is great.\n\n1854\n01:28:02,617 --> 01:28:07,427\nI take that same laptop and hand it to\nNate, and he goes this is a piece of junk,\n\n1855\n01:28:07,427 --> 01:28:12,392\ncompared to my 8-core processor that\nI've got, this thing is a hunk of junk.\n\n1856\n01:28:12,392 --> 01:28:14,296\nSo performance is very relative.\n\n1857\n01:28:14,296 --> 01:28:16,432\nYou have to have something\nto compare it to.\n\n1858\n01:28:16,432 --> 01:28:18,246\nSo when somebody comes to me and says,\n\n1859\n01:28:18,246 --> 01:28:21,821\nthat server's running really slow I\ncan't tell you if it is running slow or\n\n1860\n01:28:21,821 --> 01:28:25,390\nnot because I don't know what that\nserver normally is running at.\n\n1861\n01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:27,740\nSo that's what these data\ncollector sets are used for.\n\n1862\n01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:31,530\nThey give you a chance to collect that\ninformation under normal work loads,\n\n1863\n01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:34,120\nwe monitor our server's performance,\nand we save it.\n\n1864\n01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:38,210\nAnd we monitor once a week or once a month\nor whenever we have a problem, and\n\n1865\n01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:39,140\nI can now compare.\n\n1866\n01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:43,480\nSo when they come to me and the say, man,\nthe DNS server is going really slow.\n\n1867\n01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:47,600\nI can go go capture that performance\ninformation a second time, compare it what\n\n1868\n01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,760\nI captured a month ago and say it's\ndoing about the same it always is.\n\n1869\n01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,050\nOr no, you're right.\n\n1870\n01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:54,250\nIt is running a lot slower.\n\n1871\n01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:57,645\nThose new 150 users we've\nadded has had a big impact.\n\n1872\n01:28:57,645 --> 01:28:59,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1873\n01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,220\nNow, yeah.\n\n1874\n01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:04,650\nAnd in those data collector sets,\nso we can capture our baseline.\n\n1875\n01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:08,040\nWe can build our own data collector sets.\n\n1876\n01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,620\nThere are some that\nare built in under there.\n\n1877\n01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:13,720\n>> I was gonna point out, too.\n\n1878\n01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:17,657\nIf you already added them to a performance\nmonitor doing real time, it is convenient\n\n1879\n01:29:17,657 --> 01:29:21,163\nthat I can actually convert this into\na data collector set from right here.\n\n1880\n01:29:21,163 --> 01:29:22,045\nKind of cool.\n\n1881\n01:29:22,045 --> 01:29:27,063\nBut as Dave said,\nI can go down to user define,\n\n1882\n01:29:27,063 --> 01:29:33,261\nand create a new user data collector set,\ngive it a name.\n\n1883\n01:29:33,261 --> 01:29:42,207\nLet's say ITproTV- CL1 Baseline.\n\n1884\n01:29:42,207 --> 01:29:44,460\nAnd I can use template.\n\n1885\n01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,850\n[LAUGH] I don't like the templates.\n\n1886\n01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:48,190\nI don't know.\nHave you used them?\n\n1887\n01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:49,350\nHave you used the template?\n\n1888\n01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:50,255\nIt does say recommended.\n\n1889\n01:29:50,255 --> 01:29:50,760\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right.\n\n1890\n01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,290\n>> To me they add too many counters, and\n\n1891\n01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:57,740\nthen I've got a lot of work\nto do to filter them down so\n\n1892\n01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:02,680\nI almost always create my own and\nadjust the counters that I want.\n\n1893\n01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:06,570\nTo show you, though, I could say create\nfrom template, and there's a diagnostic,\n\n1894\n01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:11,200\nthere's a basic, there's a system\nperformance, and I'll use the this time,\n\n1895\n01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:14,460\nso we don't have to waste you guys' time\nwith me adding a bunch of counters again.\n\n1896\n01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:19,420\nSo, we'll do the system performance for\nNate's sake.\n\n1897\n01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,670\n>> Thanks Mike.\n\n1898\n01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,780\n>> Okay.\n\n1899\n01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:22,620\nGive it a location.\n\n1900\n01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,386\nWhere I want do it.\n\n1901\n01:30:23,386 --> 01:30:26,497\nThat's another one of those\n[SOUND] just in case they ask you.\n\n1902\n01:30:26,497 --> 01:30:32,318\nSQL and perf logs, admin is where\nit's gonna create those by default,\n\n1903\n01:30:32,318 --> 01:30:35,436\nwhere it's gonna put those reports.\n\n1904\n01:30:35,436 --> 01:30:36,319\nWho do I want to run it as?\n\n1905\n01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:39,842\nIf I want somebody else to be able\nto run this when they need to but\n\n1906\n01:30:39,842 --> 01:30:44,500\nthey don't have administrative access,\nthen I could store credentials in here.\n\n1907\n01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:49,420\nNow I'll just save and close it.\n\n1908\n01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,290\nThere's my data collector set.\n\n1909\n01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:56,310\nNow with this one, if you right-click\nit over here on the left and\n\n1910\n01:30:56,310 --> 01:31:02,050\nI pull up the properties,\nI get to see where it's gonna store that.\n\n1911\n01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:03,910\nThis is where I set my schedule.\n\n1912\n01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:05,490\nWhen we talk about a baseline,\n\n1913\n01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:08,320\nwe really wanna make sure were\ncapturing real world information.\n\n1914\n01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,660\nIn other words, if I'm the only geek\non the network at 11 o'clock on\n\n1915\n01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:16,549\na Friday night, that server's gonna\nlook like it's performing really well.\n\n1916\n01:31:16,549 --> 01:31:19,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz there's nobody there using it.\n\n1917\n01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,250\nSo I set up a schedule.\n\n1918\n01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:24,470\nI wanna capture performance information\nfrom 8 to 9 in the morning and\n\n1919\n01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:28,610\nthen again from 1 to 2 in the afternoon on\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and\n\n1920\n01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:31,600\nFriday and\nall of that together becomes my baseline.\n\n1921\n01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,650\nSo we would set up a schedule.\n\n1922\n01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:36,750\nAnd then a stop condition,\nbecause this tells you when to start.\n\n1923\n01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,600\nI want to start at eight\no'clock in the morning.\n\n1924\n01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,170\nHow long does it run for?\n\n1925\n01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:42,130\nAn hour, a minute,\nwhatever you want to do.\n\n1926\n01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:44,850\nMax size is nice, too.\n\n1927\n01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:48,272\nJust in case our log gets way too big and\nstarts eating up all our disk space.\n\n1928\n01:31:48,272 --> 01:31:52,090\n>> All right.\n\n1929\n01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:55,050\nNotice nowhere in there could I\nsee the counters that I added.\n\n1930\n01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:58,000\nFor that I’m gonna come over here and\nright-click Properties and\n\n1931\n01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,530\nthere I can see all\nthe counters that it has added.\n\n1932\n01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:01,110\n>> Nice.\n\n1933\n01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:02,210\n>> You see those asterisks?\n\n1934\n01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:07,710\nThat means every counter for\nthis category has been added.\n\n1935\n01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:10,110\nEvery counter for\nthis category has been added.\n\n1936\n01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:13,240\nAlso now the bottom of my sample\ninterval every one second or\n\n1937\n01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,020\nwhenever I want to capture that data.\n\n1938\n01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:15,810\n>> Nice.\n\n1939\n01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:16,890\n>> All right, so we want to start it up?\n\n1940\n01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:23,010\n>> Sweet.\nAnd there it goes, right?\n\n1941\n01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:24,430\n>> I know.\nExciting, isn't it?\n\n1942\n01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:25,600\n>> Yep.\nOff and running.\n\n1943\n01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,950\n>> Unlike our performance monitor node,\nwe don't get to see what's going on.\n\n1944\n01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:34,130\nIt's actually capturing that data and\nsaving it as a binary log file or\n\n1945\n01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:34,920\na blg file.\n\n1946\n01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,000\nOnce we capture enough information\nI'm just gonna go ahead and stop it.\n\n1947\n01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,920\nAnd then I've got a couple of different\nways to view that logged information.\n\n1948\n01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:51,380\nMy favorite way is just to come down\nhere to Reports > User Defined.\n\n1949\n01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:54,580\nAnd there's my baseline that I created,\n\n1950\n01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:59,700\nthere is this particular day's report and\nthere is my information.\n\n1951\n01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:06,536\nNot the most exciting view there,\nbut I got this handy, dandy button.\n\n1952\n01:33:06,536 --> 01:33:09,439\n[SOUND]\n>> Oops.\n\n1953\n01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:11,041\nYeah, this is what I was talking about.\n\n1954\n01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:16,288\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Those darn pre-defined ones.\n\n1955\n01:33:16,288 --> 01:33:17,774\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1956\n01:33:17,774 --> 01:33:19,330\n>> I mean, how do you read that?\n\n1957\n01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,670\nHow do you read that?\n\n1958\n01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:21,645\n>> The highlighter.\n\n1959\n01:33:21,645 --> 01:33:22,780\n[LAUGH]\n>> The highlighter.\n\n1960\n01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,090\n>> Let's see, does it help me at all?\n\n1961\n01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:27,500\nWe click that highlighter, and\nthen I can click on some of these.\n\n1962\n01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:31,180\nAnd I don't even think I can see the\nhighlighter amongst all that other stuff.\n\n1963\n01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:31,890\nAll right.\n\n1964\n01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:34,660\nSo, opening up the report\nlike that I'd have to\n\n1965\n01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,670\nuncheck a whole bunch of this stuff.\n\n1966\n01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:40,650\nAnother way you can open up one of\nthese log files is to go back up to\n\n1967\n01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:44,890\nthe Performance Monitor node and\nclick on View Log Data.\n\n1968\n01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:49,584\nAnd then I can choose log files and\nI can click Add and\n\n1969\n01:33:49,584 --> 01:33:54,450\nI can go browse default right\nto my perf logs folder.\n\n1970\n01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:55,610\nI find that report.\n\n1971\n01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:01,890\nNow, if I just did this, just like this,\nit would actually show me no data at all\n\n1972\n01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:06,050\nbecause you have to go\nover to the Data tab and\n\n1973\n01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:10,150\nchoose which counters you\nwant to add in your view.\n\n1974\n01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:14,590\nBut when I click Add,\nkinda hard to tell because they add so\n\n1975\n01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:16,500\nmany freaking counters to this thing.\n\n1976\n01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,360\nBut I'm only seeing the ones that\nare available from that log file.\n\n1977\n01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:21,950\nI'm not seeing every possible counter.\n\n1978\n01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:25,580\nSo if I just wanted to go in there and\nsee IPv4, I don't know.\n\n1979\n01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:31,620\nData grams per second, and\nmaybe wanna go see processor,\n\n1980\n01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:38,320\npercent processor time, if it will let me.\n\n1981\n01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,630\nIt's kind of hung up here for a second.\n\n1982\n01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:44,850\nI click OK and OK.\n\n1983\n01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:46,568\nSo there's that same log file.\n\n1984\n01:34:46,568 --> 01:34:49,679\nBut I'm only showing three of\nthe counters out of that log file.\n\n1985\n01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,033\nSo you can capture all\nof that information but\n\n1986\n01:34:53,033 --> 01:34:57,640\nthen when you view it,\nyou can view just what you need to view.\n\n1987\n01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:00,010\n>> Yes, yeah.\n\n1988\n01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:01,470\nPretty amazing tool.\n\n1989\n01:35:01,470 --> 01:35:06,780\nYou can track down those real\nhard to find problems, yeah?\n\n1990\n01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:07,880\nAnd get that guy in there.\n\n1991\n01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,830\n>> Yeah, good term to know,\nagain, baseline.\n\n1992\n01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:10,930\nAnother one is bottleneck.\n\n1993\n01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:12,520\nI mean, that's what we can use that for.\n\n1994\n01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,345\nYou're always looking for\nthat slowest piece in the link.\n\n1995\n01:35:14,345 --> 01:35:17,898\nWhich piece if I upgraded it would\neverything else speed up, right?\n\n1996\n01:35:17,898 --> 01:35:20,498\nWhat is the one piece\nthat's holding me back?\n\n1997\n01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:27,180\nThat's the bottleneck there, so that's\na good tool to use to find those guys.\n\n1998\n01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:34,710\n>> We do have another tool to measure\nour computer, and how well it does.\n\n1999\n01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:37,162\nThe reliability monitor.\n\n2000\n01:35:37,162 --> 01:35:38,500\nReliability monitor,\n\n2001\n01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:42,835\nI never really know this guy existed until\nafter I started to study for this stuff.\n\n2002\n01:35:42,835 --> 01:35:43,340\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n2003\n01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:46,080\n>> And it is a sweet tool.\n\n2004\n01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:50,935\nI just look at it to see how good\nmy computer is up and running.\n\n2005\n01:35:50,935 --> 01:35:53,980\n>> Mm-hm. Yep.\n>> It's overall health on things.\n\n2006\n01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:59,643\n>> Absolutely.\nNow again, a little terminology exam wise.\n\n2007\n01:35:59,643 --> 01:36:03,149\nReliability and performance,\nnot the same thing, right?\n\n2008\n01:36:03,149 --> 01:36:05,760\nPerformance, is your\nperception of how fast, or\n\n2009\n01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,572\nhow long it takes to do something?\n\n2010\n01:36:07,572 --> 01:36:10,090\nHow long does it take me to\nget logged in this machine?\n\n2011\n01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:12,390\nWhen I click Excel,\nhow long does it take to open up?\n\n2012\n01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:14,230\nThose are performance issues.\n\n2013\n01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:17,760\nReliability issues are my\ncomputer blue screens.\n\n2014\n01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,410\nReliability is deviation, or reliability\nissues, deviation from expected or\n\n2015\n01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:23,550\nnormal behavior.\n\n2016\n01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:26,530\nSo, when that application crashes,\nthat's a reliability issue.\n\n2017\n01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:29,040\nWhen that computer blue screens,\nthat's reliability.\n\n2018\n01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:33,010\nI can have a very fast\nmachine that is unreliable.\n\n2019\n01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:34,340\nCrashes all the time.\n\n2020\n01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:37,600\nSo, I got great performance,\nhorrible reliability.\n\n2021\n01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:42,160\nI can have a rock solid stable machine\nthat has great reliability, but\n\n2022\n01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,670\nit's slow as all get out.\n\n2023\n01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:46,290\nRight it has horrible performance,\nso reliability and\n\n2024\n01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,560\nperformance not the same thing.\n\n2025\n01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:54,280\n>> Yeah, Mike, on my machine here,\nI've got the reliability monitor.\n\n2026\n01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:57,280\n>> Let's take a [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Pull it up,\n\n2027\n01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:01,530\nthis is my computer here,\nand it's reliability.\n\n2028\n01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:02,645\n>> It's very reliable.\n\n2029\n01:37:02,645 --> 01:37:04,940\nYep, little blue line up here,\n\n2030\n01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:10,000\nkind of a little line to show how\nwell it's doing higher is better.\n\n2031\n01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,790\n>> Yeah, they scale it from\nlike one to ten up there.\n\n2032\n01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:14,740\nYou can kind of.\n\n2033\n01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:16,100\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n2034\n01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,750\n>> Ten being the best,\none being the worst.\n\n2035\n01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:23,990\n>> And on this one, it starts pretty\nmuch when you install Windows.\n\n2036\n01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:27,500\nAnd on this one,\nmine goes back as far as October 3rd.\n\n2037\n01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:30,740\nThat's when I installed or\nredid this ITPro.\n\n2038\n01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:33,460\n>> Back to 8.0, right?\n\n2039\n01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:37,035\n>> Yeah, I rolled it back to Windows 8,\noff that 8.1, so.\n\n2040\n01:37:37,035 --> 01:37:38,995\nTired on getting on that cutting edge.\n\n2041\n01:37:38,995 --> 01:37:41,325\nAnd like on this particular day, right?\n\n2042\n01:37:41,325 --> 01:37:43,775\nOn between these two on the 10th.\n\n2043\n01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:47,205\nRight, these two little\ncritical errors here.\n\n2044\n01:37:47,205 --> 01:37:50,760\nWe could see down, clicking and\nhighlighting a day.\n\n2045\n01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:54,870\nKind of breaks down that day,\nand what went on.\n\n2046\n01:37:54,870 --> 01:38:00,080\nSo, Windows was probably shutdown, [LAUGH]\nI was in a hurry or something that day.\n\n2047\n01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,840\nDadgum IVGA,\nhe's always giving me problems.\n\n2048\n01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,220\nA day of updates.\n\n2049\n01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:07,260\n>> Yeah.\n\n2050\n01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,015\n>> Right.\n>> I tell you this thing is fantastic,\n\n2051\n01:38:09,015 --> 01:38:12,650\ncuz when you have a machine that's having\na problem, you can come in here, and\n\n2052\n01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:16,270\nyour user calls you up and says man,\nlately my machine is just,\n\n2053\n01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:17,250\nit's crashing all the time.\n\n2054\n01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:20,250\nIt's where my application\nis just hanging up, and\n\n2055\n01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:23,750\nI gotta go in there in task manager, and\nI gotta force shutdown this application.\n\n2056\n01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:27,000\nI can come in here, and I can see this\nblue line running across the top,\n\n2057\n01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,530\nI got great reliability\nuntil this one day.\n\n2058\n01:38:29,530 --> 01:38:32,030\nAnd this one day all of\na sudden it takes a dip.\n\n2059\n01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:35,270\nAnd then every couple days it just dips,\nand then it climbs up and\n\n2060\n01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:37,290\nit dips, and it climbs up and it dips.\n\n2061\n01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:41,230\nWell I can use this to go back\nto the first day it dipped,\n\n2062\n01:38:41,230 --> 01:38:44,460\nclick on that day and\nI can see what changed on that machine.\n\n2063\n01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:48,595\nI can say, look there you installed\n[SOUND] and ever since then,\n\n2064\n01:38:48,595 --> 01:38:54,148\nyour computer's had issues, so maybe if\nwe remove that, that will fix the issues.\n\n2065\n01:38:54,148 --> 01:38:55,100\nAll right?\n\n2066\n01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,980\nSo, it's a great way to come in here, and\n\n2067\n01:38:56,980 --> 01:39:00,040\ntake a look at what might\nbe causing the problem?\n\n2068\n01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,390\nI love being able to click\non the different days, and\n\n2069\n01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:05,150\nsee exactly what happened\non that particular day.\n\n2070\n01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:06,470\nCuz you ask the user, what's changed?\n\n2071\n01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:08,454\nRight?\nWe've learned in our other episodes,\n\n2072\n01:39:08,454 --> 01:39:10,580\n[LAUGH] troubleshooting methodologies.\n\n2073\n01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:12,080\nWe go through a process.\n\n2074\n01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,410\nWhat has changed?\n\n2075\n01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:14,300\nWhat's different?\n\n2076\n01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:15,270\n>> Nothing.\n\n2077\n01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:17,760\n>> Isn't that what you always\nget from your end user?\n\n2078\n01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,360\n>> [LAUGH] Nothing.\n>> Nothing's changed.\n\n2079\n01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,388\nI haven't done anything.\n\n2080\n01:39:20,388 --> 01:39:22,293\n[LAUGH] Stupid thing.\n\n2081\n01:39:22,293 --> 01:39:22,876\n>> Yeah.\n>> So yeah.\n\n2082\n01:39:22,876 --> 01:39:25,148\nThis is where I can say,\nsomething did change look.\n\n2083\n01:39:25,148 --> 01:39:27,778\nYou tried to update your network driver,\n\n2084\n01:39:27,778 --> 01:39:32,147\nwith the wrong network adapter driver,\nor whatever the case maybe?\n\n2085\n01:39:32,147 --> 01:39:35,751\nSo yeah, love the reliability monitor and\nit is like you said it's a little known\n\n2086\n01:39:35,751 --> 01:39:38,405\nconsole in there a lot of people\ndon't even know it exists.\n\n2087\n01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:40,199\n>> Yeah.\n\n2088\n01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:41,109\n>> Now you do.\n\n2089\n01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:46,094\n>> Now there is one last\nlittle tool to mention on this\n\n2090\n01:39:46,094 --> 01:39:51,447\noptimizing our windows\nmachines here one last tool.\n\n2091\n01:39:51,447 --> 01:39:53,030\n>> What is it?\n\n2092\n01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:54,590\n>> And it is the indexer.\n\n2093\n01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:56,528\nIndexing options.\n\n2094\n01:39:56,528 --> 01:40:00,689\nNow I'll admit,\nI turn off indexing options.\n\n2095\n01:40:00,689 --> 01:40:02,406\nI turn it off.\n\n2096\n01:40:02,406 --> 01:40:03,524\n>> Say it isn't so.\n\n2097\n01:40:03,524 --> 01:40:04,079\n>> Yes.\n\n2098\n01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:04,695\n>> No, what?\n\n2099\n01:40:04,695 --> 01:40:06,164\n>> I shut that thing down.\n\n2100\n01:40:06,164 --> 01:40:06,858\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah.\n\n2101\n01:40:06,858 --> 01:40:09,648\n>> Well, because of your\nperformance issues, I suppose.\n\n2102\n01:40:09,648 --> 01:40:14,581\n>> Well, I heard that if you have an SSD,\nthat indexing creates\n\n2103\n01:40:14,581 --> 01:40:19,413\nthese unnecessary read and writes\n>> To your SSD will shorten its life and-\n\n2104\n01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:20,878\n>> When you say I heard,\n\n2105\n01:40:20,878 --> 01:40:23,656\nis this from they, is that who told you?\n\n2106\n01:40:23,656 --> 01:40:25,860\nThey say that this is this.\n\n2107\n01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:27,496\n>> No, it was Wes I think.\n\n2108\n01:40:27,496 --> 01:40:29,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wes told me.\n\n2109\n01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:32,385\n>> You guys know Wes from other episodes.\n\n2110\n01:40:32,385 --> 01:40:35,697\nWe'll, have to pin him down on\na source for that information.\n\n2111\n01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:37,768\n>> I can see that.\nNot the episode to discuss it,\n\n2112\n01:40:37,768 --> 01:40:41,358\nbut solid states do have supposedly\na finite number of read and write.\n\n2113\n01:40:41,358 --> 01:40:44,058\nNow, whether we hit that or not,\n\n2114\n01:40:44,058 --> 01:40:48,404\nI think is still debatable,\nbut so you turned it off?\n\n2115\n01:40:48,404 --> 01:40:51,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now on my, what yeah?\n\n2116\n01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:54,150\n>> I was gonna say, now, I don't even\nknow if we've told them what it does yet.\n\n2117\n01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:55,680\nWhat does this indexer do?\n\n2118\n01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,490\nI wanna turn it off?\n\n2119\n01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:57,660\nWhat's the advantage?\n\n2120\n01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:59,480\nWhy do I have it on in the first place?\n\n2121\n01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,170\n>> Makes searching for things quicker?\n\n2122\n01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:01,950\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n2123\n01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:04,790\n>> Right?\nCuz it's like if you're looking through\n\n2124\n01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:07,820\na book, and\nyou're trying to find a particular topic.\n\n2125\n01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:11,870\nOr where they've talked about remote\ndesktop in this book, you could\n\n2126\n01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:15,930\nflip through every single page of that\nbook looking for the word, remote desktop.\n\n2127\n01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:18,820\nIf you've got an index,\nyou could go to the index and\n\n2128\n01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:21,360\nfigure out exactly, what page it's on and\nturn right to that page.\n\n2129\n01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,900\nIt's the same thing this is doing for\nyour system.\n\n2130\n01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:26,950\nIt's allowing Windows, it's indexing all\nthe stuff that's on that hard drive.\n\n2131\n01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:30,570\nWell, not all of it, we'll see where\nwe can change what it's indexing, but\n\n2132\n01:41:30,570 --> 01:41:31,520\nthat's what it's allowing you to do.\n\n2133\n01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:36,960\nAnd it can speed up the access, because\nit knows right where to look for it.\n\n2134\n01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:39,350\nBut it does cause\na performance there are some,\n\n2135\n01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:41,532\nespecially when you first install Windows.\n\n2136\n01:41:41,532 --> 01:41:46,360\nIt's gotta go through and index\neverything, and that can take some time.\n\n2137\n01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:49,310\nIt's always when you least,\nwhen you really want the machine to\n\n2138\n01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:50,060\nbe working well-\n>> Right.\n\n2139\n01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,140\n>> You need to get something done-\n>> That darn indexer-\n\n2140\n01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:54,070\n>> You pull up task manager and\n\n2141\n01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:58,710\nthe indexer is doing something, and\nit's just sucking up half your resources.\n\n2142\n01:41:58,710 --> 01:42:00,180\nSo, I do know a lot of people,\n\n2143\n01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,310\nI give you a hard time, but\nI know a lot of people that shut it off.\n\n2144\n01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:04,030\nEven ones that don't\nhave solid state drives.\n\n2145\n01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:10,190\nWe can configure though what is index,\nand we can limit, or we can add.\n\n2146\n01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,360\nI'm just the opposite.\n\n2147\n01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,160\nI like to add things [LAUGH] to my index.\n\n2148\n01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,540\nEspecially with Windows 8, right?\n\n2149\n01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:18,080\nYou go to type on that start screen,\nand it finds things for you.\n\n2150\n01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,870\nIf it's not indexed,\nthen those things don't show up right.\n\n2151\n01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:24,660\nSome of those commands in\nsystem 32 that's not in the,\n\n2152\n01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:27,250\nwell I take that back it\nactually is a part of there now.\n\n2153\n01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:31,233\nBut yeah, we can change what's indexing on\nthere, you can go to some of your other\n\n2154\n01:42:31,233 --> 01:42:34,489\ndrives that you've got, and\nturn on some indexing on those, so.\n\n2155\n01:42:34,489 --> 01:42:36,111\nYou wanna show them?\n\n2156\n01:42:36,111 --> 01:42:37,814\n>> Yep, I've got it,\npull it up on my machine here.\n\n2157\n01:42:37,814 --> 01:42:39,446\n>> Let's do it-\n>> All right.\n\n2158\n01:42:39,446 --> 01:42:44,312\nAnd down there, clicking on it,\nthere is the indexing options.\n\n2159\n01:42:44,312 --> 01:42:46,364\n>> How did you get there?\n\n2160\n01:42:46,364 --> 01:42:47,772\n>> I got that, let me close.\n\n2161\n01:42:47,772 --> 01:42:51,080\n[SOUND] I typed in index.\n\n2162\n01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:52,279\n>> Yeah.\n\n2163\n01:42:52,279 --> 01:42:53,738\n>> Right.\n>> Windows 8 is too easy.\n\n2164\n01:42:53,738 --> 01:42:56,209\n[LAUGH]\n>> In the settings there.\n\n2165\n01:42:56,209 --> 01:42:57,320\nIndexing options.\n\n2166\n01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:03,150\nAnd in here, right, of course on the-\n>> So ITPro installation of

01:43:14,500\n>> I see your games directory is\nbeing indexed, your Internet Explorer\n\n2170\n01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:19,509\nhistory is being indexed, offline files,\nyour start menu and

01:43:29,260\nTemporary stuff.\n\n2174\n01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:30,730\nSo, it doesn't index.\n\n2175\n01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:32,550\n>> Which is cool though,\nthat we can exclude.\n\n2176\n01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:33,920\nWe can include a location, but\n\n2177\n01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,880\nthen exclude certain sub-directories\nwithin that location.\n\n2178\n01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:41,190\nThat we didn't want to be indexed.\n\n2179\n01:43:41,190 --> 01:43:47,360\n>> Now the indexer, it does not\ninclude encrypted files by

Clicking Yes, and it makes sure\nyou have full volume encryption,\n\n2183\n01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:58,769\nbecause it will get inside\nthose encrypted files.\n\n2184\n01:43:58,769 --> 01:44:01,993\nSo, it could be a security risk,\nbut we'll just click Continue,\n\n2185\n01:44:01,993 --> 01:44:04,656\nbecause I don't really read\ndialog boxes that often.\n\n2186\n01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:06,155\n>>

--> 01:44:46,780\nI would have to examine the list to see\nwhat's not in there already, .zips,\n\n2200\n01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:50,900\nSIR, RARS, or\nsomething maybe that it doesn't

completely.\n\n2210\n01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:14,780\nBut, you can go in there and\nyou can change some of those settings,\n\n2211\n01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,150\nto maybe help put that performance, or\nto include locations that aren't included.\n\n2212\n01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:22,284\nEvery time I go to that search screen and\nstart typing, it never finds this.\n\n2213\n01:45:22,284 --> 01:45:23,067\nWhy not?\n\n2214\n01:45:23,067 --> 01:45:27,902\nBecause where the location wherever this\nis, is not in your index, so add it.\n\n2215\n01:45:27,902 --> 01:45:33,323\n>> Yep, and lastly, our producer\nalready just barely clicked off of it.\n\n2216\n01:45:33,323 --> 01:45:35,392\nI had one last, one more last closer.\n\n2217\n01:45:35,392 --> 01:45:38,023\n>> One more time, mister producer.\n\n2218\n01:45:38,023 --> 01:45:40,518\n>> The rebuild,\nI was jiggled my mouse on it.\n\n2219\n01:45:40,518 --> 01:45:41,561\nI thought you were gonna see it.\n\n2220\n01:45:41,561 --> 01:45:42,157\n>> Sorry.\n\n2221\n01:45:42,157 --> 01:45:45,732\n>> [CROSSTALK] No it's fine.\n\n2222\n01:45:45,732 --> 01:45:47,525\nThe rebuild button.\n\n2223\n01:45:47,525 --> 01:45:50,180\n>> Yes.\n>> We can just throw that indexing out of\n\n2224\n01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:54,880\nthe way, and\nredo the whole thing, if indexing\n\n2225\n01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:59,830\nis something isn't quite working right for\none reason or another, you can.\n\n2226\n01:45:59,830 --> 01:46:02,670\n>> You should make changes just, if you\nwere thinking about like a physical book,\n\n2227\n01:46:02,670 --> 01:46:04,720\nyou make changes to the book,\nyou need to redo the index, right?\n\n2228\n01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,200\nTry page numbers have changed,\nthings like that.\n\n2229\n01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:11,380\nAs over time, our system's changing\nwhere things are and what is there?\n\n2230\n01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:15,010\nAnd to optimize the index,\nif we can rebuild and\n\n2231\n01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:19,640\nget rid of some of the pointers that\nno longer exist and things like that.\n\n2232\n01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,720\nSo very handy.\n\n2233\n01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:22,300\nAgain, it's a performance thing.\n\n2234\n01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:24,410\nIt does help with the performance of that.\n\n2235\n01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:28,552\n>> And Mike,\nI think that just about covers.\n\n2236\n01:46:28,552 --> 01:46:30,600\n>> Yeah, [CROSSTALK] we took\nit a little long there.\n\n2237\n01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,780\nGot excited about the performance\nmonitor and stuff.\n\n2238\n01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:33,810\nIt's such a cool console.\n\n2239\n01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:38,500\nHeck, we could spend a whole\nhour just on that guy.\n\n2240\n01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,795\n[LAUGH] Okay, maybe not you, I could.\n\n2241\n01:46:39,795 --> 01:46:44,980\n[LAUGH] But\nI am the uber geek I suppose, so yeah.\n\n2242\n01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:48,660\nUnless you got something else, I think we\ncovered pretty much everything we need to\n\n2243\n01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:52,480\nknow about optimizing\nWindow's 8 performance wise.\n\n2244\n01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,910\n>> Yep.\nAnd knowing where to go,\n\n2245\n01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:58,760\nto find if there is something\ntapping out the system where we go,\n\n2246\n01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:02,340\nhow we can find it, and\nhow we can stop it, ending it?\n\n2247\n01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,400\nAnd yeah, moving on.\n\n2248\n01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,160\n>> Exactly, yeah.\nI mean nobody likes a slow machine.\n\n2249\n01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:11,230\nGet in there figure out don't throw\nit out, don't do like I do and\n\n2250\n01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:13,890\npound it with a hammer to [LAUGH].\n\n2251\n01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:16,720\nGet in there and figure out what\nit is that's making my machine so\n\n2252\n01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:19,500\nslow and\nhow can I get in there and fix it?\n\n2253\n01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,970\nSo yeah get in there and play.\n\n2254\n01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:23,031\nAnd everything we've done here today,\n\n2255\n01:47:23,031 --> 01:47:26,858\nyou could really do on your own machine\nat home and explore and experiment.\n\n2256\n01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:27,403\n>> Yep.\n\n2257\n01:47:27,403 --> 01:47:29,729\n>> So check it out, try it,\nsee what you can get.\n\n2258\n01:47:29,729 --> 01:47:34,520\n>> All right Mike,\nI guess we'll wrap it up.\n\n2259\n01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,410\n>> I think so.\n\n2260\n01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:36,392\n>> Wrap it up for the day.\n\n2261\n01:47:36,392 --> 01:47:38,270\nMake sure you check out our Q&A section.\n\n2262\n01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:41,610\nIf you have anything, if you have\nany questions during our live shows,\n\n2263\n01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:43,290\nwe have a chat monitor up here.\n\n2264\n01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:48,980\nWe watch the chat, be sure to catch\nus out on the Roku Channel as well.\n\n2265\n01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:51,313\nWatch it there on your TV,\ninstead of a little computer or something.\n\n2266\n01:47:51,313 --> 01:47:58,319\n>> Yeah, exactly IT Pro.tv and\nRoku channel, and who knows where next.\n\n2267\n01:47:58,319 --> 01:47:59,030\n>> Yep.\n\n2268\n01:47:59,030 --> 01:48:02,484\nAll right, well, for\nITProTV, I am Nate Copeland.\n\n2269\n01:48:02,484 --> 01:48:03,611\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n2270\n01:48:03,611 --> 01:48:05,064\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n2271\n01:48:05,064 --> 01:48:15,064\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:38,410\nwelcome back To another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,230\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Nate Copeland.\n\n5\n00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,030\nHow's it going Nate?\n\n6\n00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,905\n>> Pretty good Don, how are you?\n\n7\n00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:47,310\n[APPLAUSE]\n>> We need a live studio audience.\n\n8\n00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,790\nOur live studio audience today made\nup of our producer, Jason, and us.\n\n9\n00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,680\n>> He's our director.\n\n10\n00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,190\n>> Director, director Jason.\n\n11\n00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,210\nI gotta get my titles right otherwise\nthe union's gonna get that nasty letter.\n\n12\n00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Jason, are you in the, you wouldn't be\n\n13\n00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,794\na Screen Actors Guild, you'd be\nwhatever guild the directors are in.\n\n14\n00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:09,322\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n15\n00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:09,826\n>> The Elves Guild.\n\n16\n00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:12,830\n>> [LAUGH] The Elves Guild, there you go.\n\n17\n00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,025\nI'm a level 27 director.\n\n18\n00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:17,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so, completely off topic.\n\n19\n00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,290\nSo today we're gonna have another exciting\nWindows 8 episode as we start to wind down\n\n20\n00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,970\nthe objectives, we're really getting down\nto the last couple episodes on this one\n\n21\n00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,690\nfor our first run through.\n\n22\n00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,500\nAnd so the topic we're gonna hit today is,\nin my opinion,\n\n23\n00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,670\nreally the most important one, right.\n\n24\n00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,620\nMicrosoft listed as one of the last\nobjectives, objective seven\n\n25\n00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,010\n>> Configure, backup and recovery options,\n\n26\n00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,060\nbut if you're going to be out in\nthe field working with Windows 8,\n\n27\n00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,740\nsupporting desktops, these backup and\nrecovery operations are going to be how\n\n28\n00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,330\nyou earn your salary,\nhow you make your money.\n\n29\n00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,310\n>> Yeah, you got to keep them,\n\n30\n00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,430\nI use computer fails down,\na deal to keep things backed up.\n\n31\n00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,660\nAll the praise you get and\nthe pats on the back.\n\n32\n00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,200\nAnd you come back, you've saved\neverybody's files, and all the cheers and\n\n33\n00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,020\nChristmas cards.\n\n34\n00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,386\n>> That's right,\nit's all about the praise, isn't it?\n\n35\n00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:08,990\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n36\n00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,940\n>> Or the look of disgust you\n\n37\n00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,090\nget when they have to call the IT guy\nto come and help with the computer.\n\n38\n00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,990\nAnd when it, ugh,\nthis should have just worked.\n\n39\n00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,500\nYep.\nShould've just worked, dang it.\n\n40\n00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,240\n>> If I had a Mac,\nthis wouldn't have happened.\n\n41\n00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,370\nIf we switched to Linux,\nthis problem would be gone.\n\n42\n00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,500\nAll right.\n\n43\n00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,930\nRegardless of what\noperating system you run,\n\n44\n00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,730\nbackups are an essential part\nof your support process.\n\n45\n00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,050\n>> And Windows eight has some\nreally cool stuff built in.\n\n46\n00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,290\nSome of which is new.\n\n47\n00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,070\nSome of which has been around\nin Windows a long time.\n\n48\n00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,750\nAll of which is moved\nbecause god forbid we leave\n\n49\n00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,900\nany option in the place it was\nin the last version of Windows.\n\n50\n00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,060\nSo if you're a Windows 7 master,\nthe concepts are still the same,\n\n51\n00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,710\nbut the links are all in different places.\n\n52\n00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,320\n>> So Don, let me ask you.\n\n53\n00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,900\nHave you ever lost a lot of data?\n\n54\n00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,340\nOr just, how about,\n\n55\n00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,760\nhave you lost important data because\nyou didn't set your backups?\n\n56\n00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,620\n>> One time, in college.\n\n57\n00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,040\nSo now it sounds like one of those\nstories, like, one time in college.\n\n58\n00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,690\n>> Oh!\n\n59\n00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:15,110\n>> So one time in college I had a hard\ndrive that it actually caught on fire.\n\n60\n00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,440\nSomething happened to\nthe motor inside of it and\n\n61\n00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,620\nI started smelling that burnt solder\nsmell and I opened up my case and\n\n62\n00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,130\nthere was literally smoke\ncoming out of the hard drive.\n\n63\n00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,460\nIt was pretty awesome.\n\n64\n00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,010\nAnd I was in college,\nI didn't have a lot of money, and the hard\n\n65\n00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,860\ndrive was still under warranty, so\nI was like, alright, it's under warranty!\n\n66\n00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,960\nBut I didn't have money to do the advanced\nreplacement, and I had to go.\n\n67\n00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,630\nEight weeks, six weeks,\nsomething like that, without a hard drive.\n\n68\n00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,680\nSo, basically I had no computer.\n\n69\n00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,040\nI had to use the lab ones.\n\n70\n00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,530\nBut, I lost a lot of stuff on that\nhard drive and it really sucked.\n\n71\n00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,280\nNow, it was just school papers and stuff.\n\n72\n00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,730\nIt wasn't like I had a ton of\nfamily photos like I do now.\n\n73\n00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,680\nSo, as your life evolves.\n\n74\n00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,510\nThe importance of your data changes\ntoo but yeah I have how bout you?\n\n75\n00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,630\n>> Yeah I have once before.\n\n76\n00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,310\nAll my saved games right?\n\n77\n00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,500\nThe hard drive just woke up one day,\nthe computer didn't recognize it and\n\n78\n00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,440\nall my saved games.\n\n79\n00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,510\nI mean all the work I went through\nto get so far in those games...\n\n80\n00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:24,590\nAnd it was all gone, and so\nnow I use scheduled backup and\n\n81\n00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,160\neven though I have a removable disk now.\n\n82\n00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,380\nAnd I pop it out and set it in the closet.\n\n83\n00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,341\n>> It's a lesson that most\npeople have to learn once.\n\n84\n00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hopefully only once.\n\n85\n00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,170\nWhen you lose that data, when you have\nthat sinking feeling in your chest, and\n\n86\n00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,462\nyou're just like, oh,\nI'm not gonna be able to get that back.\n\n87\n00:04:40,462 --> 00:04:41,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n88\n00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,130\nthere's just, there's nothing you can do.\n\n89\n00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,830\nYou know?\nYou can send your hard drive off, and for\n\n90\n00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,240\nabout five or six grand they'll\ndo that drive recovery stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,490\nIf it's really critical.\n\n92\n00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,780\nBut most of the time, data's just gone.\n\n93\n00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,530\nAnd so we need to do something about it.\n\n94\n00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,930\nAnd there are a lot of cloud\nservices that are out there.\n\n95\n00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,550\nThere's companies like Carbonite, which\nhas an awesome product, and CrashPlan and\n\n96\n00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,730\nguys like that.\n\n97\n00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,390\nWhich are wonderful, but\nif you've got sensitive data,\n\n98\n00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,240\ndata that you don't want to put in the\ncloud, and don't feel guilty about that.\n\n99\n00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,130\nNo matter how much Microsoft\ntells you cloud is awesome,\n\n100\n00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,320\ndon't feel like you have to use it.\n\n101\n00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,520\nWindows 8 has perfectly good backup and\nrestore features right inside of it.\n\n102\n00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,170\nNow pros and cons.\n\n103\n00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,490\nWhen you deal with something like\ncarbonite, it's offsite, right,\n\n104\n00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,930\nthey're storing that backup for\nyou at another location so\n\n105\n00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,270\neven if you're entire house burns down,\nyou're fine.\n\n106\n00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,790\nThe Windows eight backup stuff that\nwe're gonna show you though is much\n\n107\n00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,420\nmore localized.\n\n108\n00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,110\nWe're backing up to things like USB\nkeys and hard drives and so on.\n\n109\n00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,860\nSo if your house burns down, unless you\nmanaged to take a copy of that with you,\n\n110\n00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,030\nyou probably have lost your data.\n\n111\n00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,100\nSo there's usually a healthy\nmix that you find.\n\n112\n00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,640\nAn online backup for some data,\nlocal backups for others.\n\n113\n00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,330\nAnd there's your healthy medium.\n\n114\n00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,775\n>> A little bit of work now,\nhaving these things set up,\n\n115\n00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:04,730\non-site, offsite, saves a lot\nof heartache, a lot of trouble.\n\n116\n00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,430\na lot of time trying to recover\nthose files in the future and\n\n117\n00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,595\nso spend the time now and you know you\ncan all ways have those save games later\n\n118\n00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,060\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n119\n00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,290\nNow you are burdened with playing\nthrough all those video games\n\n120\n00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,660\nagain\n>> I know gosh\n\n121\n00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,160\n>> All right, so\n\n122\n00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,040\nlet's start off with just the simple\nback up processes, right?\n\n123\n00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,370\nSo how can we back up\nour stuff in Windows?\n\n124\n00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,130\nNow you can go low tech, and you can just\nhighlight your files and choose copy, and\n\n125\n00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,900\ngo to a USB key and choose paste, right?\n\n126\n00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,100\nYou can do that.\n\n127\n00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,540\nBut there are better systems that are\nbuilt into windows that are optimized for\n\n128\n00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,240\nspeed that allow you to continue working\nwith the system while it's doing\n\n129\n00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,810\nthe back up that can monitor for\nchanges and just back up what changed.\n\n130\n00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,190\nThey can back up securely,\nsome really really nice features.\n\n131\n00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,350\n>> If we use the backup system\ninside of Windows 8, all right?\n\n132\n00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,160\nIn previous versions of Windows\nthis was called Windows Backup, but\n\n133\n00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,150\nin Windows 8 it's now\ncalled file recovery.\n\n134\n00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,690\nThe underlying technology is the same,\nit's just got a different name.\n\n135\n00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,490\nRight.\n\n136\n00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,210\nSo let's walk them through,\n\n137\n00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,280\nNate maybe I'll steer and you can do\nthe guided tour on doing a backup?\n\n138\n00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,840\n>> Yeah sure.\n\n139\n00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,090\nWe can do the system image first,\nis that alright?\n\n140\n00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,130\nYeah, sure.\n\n141\n00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:21,960\n>> All right.\n\n142\n00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,280\nSo on Don's computer here,\n\n143\n00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,420\nthe first thing that we're going to\ndo is get into the File History menu.\n\n144\n00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,730\nHe's running Windows 8.1 on here.\n\n145\n00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,510\nAnd then File History,\nyep, right down there.\n\n146\n00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,965\nAnd then final history, down in the bottom\nleft, we have system image backup.\n\n147\n00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:48,364\nAnd this will take a full\ndisk backup of the full disk.\n\n148\n00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:49,906\n>> Of the whole thing, yeah.\n\n149\n00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:53,085\nThis is, it's one of the best\ntypes of backups cause it does,\n\n150\n00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:55,481\nit gets the Entire computer, right?\n\n151\n00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:59,540\nNow, if you think about that,\nthat may be a lot of data.\n\n152\n00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,310\nAnd so, when you do\na System Image backup like this,\n\n153\n00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,040\nyou gotta have a lot of storage,\nall right?\n\n154\n00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,200\nYou can backup to a USB hard drive, you\ncan get those Seagate and Western Digital,\n\n155\n00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,240\nthey make these USB 3.0, and FireWire,\nif you've got that, or ESXi, even better.\n\n156\n00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,790\nHard drives that you can\nstick on your computer, and\n\n157\n00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,190\nyou can back up the whole system to it.\n\n158\n00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,520\nThat way, no matter what happens to\nyour computer, failed hard drive,\n\n159\n00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,570\nvirus infection, deleted files.\n\n160\n00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,560\nYou've got this whole total back\nup right there on your drive.\n\n161\n00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,010\nSo, System Image can backup a lot of data.\n\n162\n00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,240\nWe're not picking individual files here,\nit is just getting the whole thing.\n\n163\n00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,340\n>> So, and with it bringing and\ncapturing the whole thing.\n\n164\n00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,532\nWhether it's an external drive,\nwhether it's a network share.\n\n165\n00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:48,396\nYou'll need to have the amount of hard\ndrive space that you're backing up free on\n\n166\n00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,908\nthe destination where you're going to.\n\n167\n00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:56,368\nAnd I believe if Windows 8 does not\nfind a suitable drive for that,\n\n168\n00:08:56,368 --> 00:09:02,041\nit'll either grey the options out or\nit just won't finish through.\n\n169\n00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,130\n>> Yeah, you know mine,\nI just fired it up here.\n\n170\n00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,600\n>> It's defaulting to backup\nto a network location.\n\n171\n00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,510\nSo, if i have a NAS box,\nyou know Network Attached Storage,\n\n172\n00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,070\nor if I have a server with a shared\nfolder on it, I can back up to that.\n\n173\n00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,268\nI did add an extra hard drive to this one,\nthat apparently it's not seeing.\n\n174\n00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:20,163\nI wonder if it's upset because\nI never initialized it?\n\n175\n00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:23,890\nLet me,\nIt's a completely blank hard drive, so.\n\n176\n00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:31,600\nLet me get in here and see if I can\nfigure out why it's not seeing that disk.\n\n177\n00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,378\nOh, that's not the screen\nI was looking for.\n\n178\n00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:37,660\n>> [LAUGH]\nWindows X.\n\n179\n00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,245\n>> Oh, yeah, my little Windows X\nshortcut key, thank you Nick.\n\n180\n00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,000\nWindows X, if you're not familiar with it,\n\n181\n00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,870\nI always forget about it and\nit's incredibly useful.\n\n182\n00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,000\nBut I wanted to get into\ncomputer management, and\n\n183\n00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,330\nmy little search screen\nsent me somewhere else.\n\n184\n00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,660\nI just wanna verify this\nhardware that I added.\n\n185\n00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,170\nSo I stuck an extra hard drive\non the system specifically so\n\n186\n00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,390\nI could back up to it,\nand many people do this.\n\n187\n00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,230\nIt's one of the best ways to guarantee it.\n\n188\n00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,920\nThere it is.\nBut I hadn't initialized it, so\n\n189\n00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,150\nI'm just gonna bring it in.\n\n190\n00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,931\nI'll just do an MBR disk on this one.\n\n191\n00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:11,983\nAnd I'm pretty sure I don't have to format\nit, so let me go back to this wizard,\n\n192\n00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:15,906\nand I'm gonna tell it to\nrefresh my disk listing, and\n\n193\n00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,700\napparently you do have to format it.\n\n194\n00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,713\nAll right, well, let me go ahead and\njust do that real quick.\n\n195\n00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,400\nGive it a drive letter.\n\n196\n00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,546\nI'm just going with the defaults here,\nI'm gonna format it NTFS, so\n\n197\n00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,602\nI'm gonna call it my backup disk.\n\n198\n00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:35,186\nThere we go.\n\n199\n00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:39,700\nNow, Microsoft recommends that if\nyou have a USB drive or a hard\n\n200\n00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,020\ndrive attached that you're using for\nbackups to that, be all you use it for.\n\n201\n00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,910\nYou're not supposed to use it for\nanything else.\n\n202\n00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,120\nSo, when you do the backup, it will\ngive us a little warning about erasing\n\n203\n00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,950\nthat disk, if it ever sees that it's,\nthere we go.\n\n204\n00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,160\nAll right, so now it's got my\nE drive that I can backup to.\n\n205\n00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,840\nSo this does need to be exclusively for\nthat use.\n\n206\n00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,840\nIf you have multiple partitions on one\nhard drive, you can do that too, but\n\n207\n00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,755\nit's not as ideal.\n\n208\n00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:03,670\nBecause if you have a hard drive failure,\nyou're gonna lose your backup, right?\n\n209\n00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,670\nSo, they really want it\nto be a separate drive.\n\n210\n00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,310\n>> All right, yep.\n\n211\n00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,735\nContinue on through the wizard there,\nright.\n\n212\n00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:16,132\nNow what, so here we have what it\nis going to be backing up here.\n\n213\n00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:21,784\nSo we've got System Partition,\nour C drive, yep, the Recovery part,\n\n214\n00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:26,710\nand it will be going on to our\nexternal drive in there, E drive.\n\n215\n00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,567\n>> Not a lot of options here, right, it's\nnot letting me pick individual files or\n\n216\n00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,440\nfolders, it's saying, you know what,\nI'm gonna get your whole drive.\n\n217\n00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,345\nYour whole C drive, everything that's\non there, we're gonna back it up.\n\n218\n00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,902\nThe EFI System partition,\nthat's your boot partition,\n\n219\n00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:41,170\nhow it knows how to find\nthe operating system.\n\n220\n00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,880\nAnd then the Recovery System, those\nare the tools we use to recover it with.\n\n221\n00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,900\nSo that's what it's gonna back up.\n\n222\n00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,000\nIt's gonna get the whole thing and,\nyou know Nate,\n\n223\n00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,967\nI almost hesitate to start this,\nI don't know how long it's gonna take.\n\n224\n00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:55,009\nHow big is our C drive right now?\n\n225\n00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:59,330\nSo, it is 44.5 GB,\nit could take a little while.\n\n226\n00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,450\nBut, you know what,\nI'm a risk taker, let's start it up.\n\n227\n00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,181\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and start it,\nand it's gonna churn away, and\n\n228\n00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,400\nit's now gonna make a backup.\n\n229\n00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,081\nNow the coolest part about this is,\n\n230\n00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:10,680\nin the background it's using a service\ncalled Volume Shadow Copy, right?\n\n231\n00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,145\nAnd you guys have already heard about\nthat in some of the other episodes.\n\n232\n00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:19,000\nSo, Volume Shadow Copy allows us\nto take a snapshot of files, and\n\n233\n00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,820\nit basically makes a second copy, so\n\n234\n00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,690\nthat you can continue working with\nthe file, but there's a static image of\n\n235\n00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,190\nit that was saved at a certain point\nin time that we can now backup from.\n\n236\n00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,040\nSo, that's what it's\ndoing in the background.\n\n237\n00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,230\nIt's actually moving\nalong pretty quick here.\n\n238\n00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,040\nBut it is backing up the whole thing,\nall right?\n\n239\n00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,490\nSo Nate, let's show them the alternative.\n\n240\n00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,418\nLet's show them backing up\nindividual files or folders.\n\n241\n00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:42,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n242\n00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,385\nAll right, yeah, back in here now,\nwe do have File History?\n\n243\n00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:47,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n244\n00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,380\n>> We do have this cool thing, File\nHistory, and this is new to Windows 8.\n\n245\n00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:59,940\nAnd what this does is, it backs up your\nlibraries, and it does it automatically.\n\n246\n00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,890\nAnd we can, you know what,\nlet's turn File History on.\n\n247\n00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,090\n>> So my extra hard drive is being\nconsumed by that backup that's running.\n\n248\n00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,930\nBut notice, I've got that option here,\nselect a network location.\n\n249\n00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,160\nSo I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna use\na network location for this one.\n\n250\n00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,940\nWhich is cool, because then you don't\nhave to have a dedicated drive.\n\n251\n00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,820\nYou could just pick another server\nsomewhere, and chose to backup to it.\n\n252\n00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,740\nAlthough, you know what,\nhere it's showing, whatever,\n\n253\n00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,240\nI'll add that network location.\n\n254\n00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,055\nSo, I'm gonna backup to my server.\n\n255\n00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:33,396\nI've got, let's see, ITProTV,\nI think DC1 is the only\n\n256\n00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:38,412\nother server on right now,\nso let's take a look at it.\n\n257\n00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:43,874\nThere we go, and\nI'll just make a folder on here\n\n258\n00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:48,928\nwhich I will call ITProTV-CL1-Backup,\n\n259\n00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:56,594\nso this is going to be the back up\nlocation for my ITProTV Client 1.\n\n260\n00:13:56,594 --> 00:14:01,833\n>> All right, let's select that guy and\nquit going through it.\n\n261\n00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,259\nNow with File History,\nwe can set things up to where\n\n262\n00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:10,120\nit'll capture what's in your library,\nand at certain intervals, and\n\n263\n00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,483\nwe can set the amount of space that it\nwill automatically back all your files up.\n\n264\n00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:20,532\nAnd I've actually set File History\nup at the house, to get\n\n265\n00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:25,606\nthe pictures, and movies, and things that-\n>> Video games, saved games.\n\n266\n00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:26,327\n>> Yeah.\n\n267\n00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,464\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, one thing it cannot do,\n\n268\n00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:33,800\nI've mentioned it twice before,\nbut yeah, backup libraries.\n\n269\n00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,850\nIt cannot do other files outside of\nthose libraries, but what you can do\n\n270\n00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:45,460\nis create a library, and then add that\nfolder to that library and go that route.\n\n271\n00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,140\n>> Yeah, I think we talked about that\nin one of the early Windows 8 episodes.\n\n272\n00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,603\nDidn't we?\nOne of the, where we did File Libraries?\n\n273\n00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:53,240\nEither way, yeah.\n\n274\n00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,890\nI use something similar,\nI don't actually the Windows Backup,\n\n275\n00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,760\nI use a different program.\n\n276\n00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,230\nBut, I know, it's sacrilege.\n\n277\n00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,760\nBut my computer,\nI format my laptop regularly, right?\n\n278\n00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,010\nRonnie's always teasing about it.\n\n279\n00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,650\nIt's rare for my laptop to go more than\ntwo weeks without getting formatted,\n\n280\n00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,390\nbecause I'll try different operating\nsystems, and betas, and stuff like that,\n\n281\n00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,745\nso it's constantly flipping through.\n\n282\n00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,485\nSo, the majority of the data on\nmy laptop is not important to me.\n\n283\n00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:19,065\nRight, like all the Windows files,\nI don't care about those,\n\n284\n00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:20,515\nbecause I have a Windows install disk.\n\n285\n00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:24,295\nAnd if I have other applications\ninstalled, like video games, right?\n\n286\n00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:27,455\nI use Steam, so I can go to Steam and\njust download the games again,\n\n287\n00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:29,285\nwhat do I care, right?\n\n288\n00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:30,728\nExcept for my data cache.\n\n289\n00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:33,800\n[LAUGH] But other than that, who cares?\n\n290\n00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,637\nSo, there's really only a small set\nof data that's truly important to me,\n\n291\n00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,746\nand it's things like my\nweb browser favorites.\n\n292\n00:15:41,746 --> 00:15:44,020\nWhich, if you're using Chrome,\nalready syncs up to the crowd, but\n\n293\n00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,366\nif you're using, oops, to the cloud.\n\n294\n00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:48,486\nCrowd, cloud, whatever, but\nif your using Internet Explorer,\n\n295\n00:15:48,486 --> 00:15:49,722\nyou need to back those up.\n\n296\n00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:51,446\nYour My Documents folder.\n\n297\n00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:54,326\nIf that's where you're saving all of your\ndocuments, you want to back that up.\n\n298\n00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:58,280\nAnd that's usually a much smaller\npercentage of your total drive.\n\n299\n00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,110\nSo I don't necessarily need to back up my\nentire hard drive if I know there's just\n\n300\n00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,290\na subset of data that I really need.\n\n301\n00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,530\nAnd that's what file history lets us do.\n\n302\n00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:12,610\nI can turn this on, and then we can start\nto pick some of that data that's important\n\n303\n00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,410\nto us that we want to have backed up and\nit will take care of it for us.\n\n304\n00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,750\nInstead of us having to go through and\ndo a full system back up,\n\n305\n00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,428\nwhich mine is still running back here.\n\n306\n00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:26,670\nWe're about 60% of the way through.\n\n307\n00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,530\nIt's taken a long time to do this backup,\nand that's to a local drive.\n\n308\n00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,360\nImagine to a network drive, right?\n\n309\n00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,376\n>> A long time,\nthat's moving pretty quick.\n\n310\n00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:35,955\n>> Well, 40 gigs.\n\n311\n00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:37,115\n>> Yeah.\n\n312\n00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:37,789\nAll right.\n\n313\n00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,031\n>> Okay.\n\n314\n00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:43,339\nI'm used to my fiber channel\nSAN that I have at home.\n\n315\n00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:43,919\n>> Holy crap.\n\n316\n00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,579\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I had no idea.\n\n317\n00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:46,520\n>> I do not have a fiber\ncable SAN at home.\n\n318\n00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,712\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me just mention\n\n319\n00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:48,315\nthat to the viewers.\n\n320\n00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:50,360\n[LAUGH]\n>> Shoot, even,\n\n321\n00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,190\nI mean, antivirus takes longer\nthan backing up your entire disk.\n\n322\n00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,720\n>> That is true.\n\n323\n00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,830\nAn antivirus scan can,\ncan take a lot longer.\n\n324\n00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,980\n>> You know, here it is grabbing\nthe files and copy them, so\n\n325\n00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,830\nthis is a straight copy operation.\n\n326\n00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,530\nEven being filtered through\nthe volume shadow copy provider.\n\n327\n00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,920\nAll right.\n\n328\n00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,700\nWell, now my file history is turned on,\nand there's some stuff that it grabs by\n\n329\n00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,570\ndefault, but\nit's set up to be ready to do that backup.\n\n330\n00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,777\nAnd like Nate said,\n\n331\n00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:19,049\nthere's a lot of stuff in here that\nwe can use to customize the options.\n\n332\n00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:21,654\n>> Let them\n>> Oh, I got click happy,\n\n333\n00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,300\nlet me cancel out of that.\n\n334\n00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,628\n>> Let's jump into\nthe Advanced Settings over there.\n\n335\n00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:28,824\n>> Because we're advanced.\n\n336\n00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:31,510\n>> Yep now the defaults, right?\n\n337\n00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,496\nThe defaults are real important\nif you just set this thing up.\n\n338\n00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:38,840\nWhat it's gonna do is save copies.\n\n339\n00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,530\nAll right, by default every hour,\n\n340\n00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,880\nevery hour it's going to\nsave that document down.\n\n341\n00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,450\nAnd it's going to keep those saved\nversions, by default, forever.\n\n342\n00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,880\nIt's just going to keep adding more,\nand more, and more copies in there.\n\n343\n00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,100\nAnd if we drop that forever down, we can\n\n344\n00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,610\nset up until space is needed, it'll start\ndeleting all that other stuff in there.\n\n345\n00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,040\nNo worries, set up time.\n\n346\n00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,040\nI mean if you're backing up a lot of\nfiles, let's say if you're in a place that\n\n347\n00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,330\nhas 20 PCs and\nyou enable file history on these 20 PCs.\n\n348\n00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,060\nAnd now, every hour,\nit's sitting there dumping files on there.\n\n349\n00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,374\nI guess if you're one to save everything,\nbut yeah,\n\n350\n00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:24,919\nit can really blow through\nsome disk space pretty quick.\n\n351\n00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,259\n>> Yeah, it is somewhat efficient, though,\n\n352\n00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:30,360\nin that it's only backing\nup what's changed.\n\n353\n00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,390\nSo, if I've got 1,000 documents\nin My Documents folder,\n\n354\n00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,630\nthe first time that it backs it up,\nit backs up 1,000 documents.\n\n355\n00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,550\nBut, the next time it backs up, it's only\ngoing to back up the ones that changed.\n\n356\n00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,950\nBut it is going to keep copies of them.\n\n357\n00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,210\nSo, if I continually change that file,\nif I change that file everyday,\n\n358\n00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,840\nthere's a copy of that file for\nevery day that I modified it on.\n\n359\n00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,330\nSo it can bloat especially if you have\nmultiple computers, even in a home\n\n360\n00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,470\nenvironment, where you might have a couple\nof systems there at home it can build up.\n\n361\n00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,360\nSo you can set limits to that and\nthat is pretty handy as well as\n\n362\n00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,660\nlimiting the amount of space that's\navailable for the cache and so on.\n\n363\n00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,145\nSo you might need to tweak these a bit\nto find that sweet spot for you.\n\n364\n00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,430\nCuz it is nice to be able to say,\n\n365\n00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:15,410\nyou know what I deleted this file\na week ago, I still have a copy of it.\n\n366\n00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,880\nVersus traditional backups,\n\n367\n00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,670\nlike the backup I'm doing to that\nhard drive in the background.\n\n368\n00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,830\nThat is just one backup,\njust one point in time.\n\n369\n00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,810\nIf I backup to it again\nit's going to overwrite it.\n\n370\n00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,060\nThere's options to tweak that, but\nby default it's going to overwrite it.\n\n371\n00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,560\nSo if I had something that I deleted\na week ago, but I did a backup yesterday.\n\n372\n00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,480\nI no longer have a way to restore that,\nso this gives us that power.\n\n373\n00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,100\n>> And\nsimilar to Windows Backup file history,\n\n374\n00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,520\nit cannot backup to the system drive.\n\n375\n00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,510\nIt has to be an external drive,\na separate hard drive.\n\n376\n00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:54,695\nPreferably a network drive to get it\noff the PC, in case of I don't know.\n\n377\n00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,917\n>> Hard drive failure or stuff like that.\n\n378\n00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,663\n>> Hard drive failure and\nfire, apparently.\n\n379\n00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,870\n>> Which you want to do anyway, so\nMicrosoft putting that limitation in there\n\n380\n00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,230\nis just kinda forcing you to do something\nsmart, instead of something dumb.\n\n381\n00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,690\nNow once we get this set up,\nit's set up to backup every hour.\n\n382\n00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,210\nThat might be to frequently for you,\n\n383\n00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,400\nyou might wanna change it\nto just go daily, right?\n\n384\n00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,830\nSo once a day it's gonna do the backup.\n\n385\n00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,780\nI set mine only to save a month, so\n\n386\n00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,880\nif I changed every single file\nthat I have, every single day,\n\n387\n00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,420\nat a maximum there'd be 30 copies of\neach file, or 31 copies of each file.\n\n388\n00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,540\nBut you can specify how\nyou wanna limit that.\n\n389\n00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,840\nAnd then it's ready to go.\n\n390\n00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,420\nAll right?\n\n391\n00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,550\nThe only other things that we may need\nto tweak are what it's backing up.\n\n392\n00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,030\nIt's backing up by default your libraries.\n\n393\n00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,700\nSo it is getting your documents,\nyour pictures, your videos,\n\n394\n00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,680\nthose things that are in\nyour standard libraries.\n\n395\n00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,190\nNow what do I mean by the libraries?\n\n396\n00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,010\nWell, If I fire up the Windows Explorer\nhere, that's these folders here\n\n397\n00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,365\nunder this PC, desktop, documents,\ndownloads, my music, whatever.\n\n398\n00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:56,870\nAnd the navigation is strange because\nsometimes it will actually say libraries\n\n399\n00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,970\nand sometimes it doesn't, right.\n\n400\n00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:04,068\nIf you go in, what the way where you go in\nand see where it actually says library.\n\n401\n00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:07,210\n>> Yeah, 8.1, yeah they changed it up.\n\n402\n00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:07,730\n>> Oh, did they?\n\n403\n00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,940\n>> A little bit.\n\n404\n00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,260\n>> Do you have it pulled up on yours?\n\n405\n00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,580\n>> Yep.\n>> Let's switch over to Nate's machine for\n\n406\n00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,425\na second Jason, and that way they\ncan see it in the native Windows 8.\n\n407\n00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:21,170\n>> Yep, so here we have our libraries,\nright there.\n\n408\n00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,990\nAnd underneath is what, by default,\nI was gonna be snagging documents,\n\n409\n00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,850\nmusic, pictures, and videos, and that's\nwhere it's gonna look and grab that stuff.\n\n410\n00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,080\n>> So, just for\n\n411\n00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,880\ncompleteness, let's show them an example\nof how you'd add some other folder, right?\n\n412\n00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,420\nSo let's Let's say that you\nhad a folder C:/games right?\n\n413\n00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,480\nAnd that was where you put your games and\nyour save files or\n\n414\n00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,530\nwhatever and you wanted to\nback that up also, all right.\n\n415\n00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,440\nWell all you would do is you would take\nthe games folder and add it to a library.\n\n416\n00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,230\nYou can add it to an existing library or\nadd it to its own library if you want to.\n\n417\n00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,910\nAnd when you do that, it's now going\nto be a separate library of it's own,\n\n418\n00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,910\nand it'll be able to be backed up.\n\n419\n00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,940\nOr oh you moved it, way to go,\nyou ruined everything.\n\n420\n00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,250\nNow you have to format and reinstall.\n\n421\n00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,317\nI hope you had a back up.\n\n422\n00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:17,752\n[LAUGH]\n>> Actually I don't on this one.\n\n423\n00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:18,994\nNice.\n\n424\n00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:22,690\n>> So, anyhow, you basically just\nmake a new library in there for\n\n425\n00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,450\nit and it'll be in business.\n\n426\n00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,535\nAnd Nate, if I remember right.\n\n427\n00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:28,950\nSo how did you drag that?\n\n428\n00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,126\nDid you do like a right-click + drag or\nsomething.\n\n429\n00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:39,300\n>> I hit, you know what?\n\n430\n00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,615\n>> So what I normally do is I\nright-click on the folder and in Windows\n\n431\n00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:49,230\n8.1 you've got the include in library\noption and you can just choose a library.\n\n432\n00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,900\nI don't know if that was in\nWindows 8 straight from factory.\n\n433\n00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,750\nSo if you right-click on that,\nyeah Include in Library, there it is.\n\n434\n00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,480\nAnd so you can include it in your\ndocuments, library or music.\n\n435\n00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,380\nAnd then that way it doesn't move\nthe folder it just links it in there and\n\n436\n00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,760\nthat way the folder can\nstay where it is but\n\n437\n00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,330\nit is now getting backed\nup as part of your stuff.\n\n438\n00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,030\nSo, see how his games folder is\nstill right there in C:/games,\n\n439\n00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,150\nbut under the documents\nlibrary you now see it.\n\n440\n00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,210\nSo that will get it backed up and\npretty easy right?\n\n441\n00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,220\nSo you don't have to change your file\nstructure, really easy to add things in so\n\n442\n00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,510\nthey're now covered in that backup.\n\n443\n00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,020\nNow you probably wouldn't want to\ndo your whole games folder right?\n\n444\n00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,510\nYou'd probably do just wherever the save\nfiles go or something like that.\n\n445\n00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,490\nSo pretty straightforward right?\n\n446\n00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,710\nI mean really not too crazy.\n\n447\n00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,557\n>> Yeah, straightforward,\nsimple, built in,\n\n448\n00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:40,124\nworks great, easy to set up and configure.\n\n449\n00:23:40,124 --> 00:23:43,953\nYeah, a little bit of work now will\nsave your bacon a little later.\n\n450\n00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:48,277\n>> All right, so the last thing that we\nneed to talk about here on this particular\n\n451\n00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:52,398\nback up setup is I just did that backup\non, I'm in our client one here, and\n\n452\n00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,683\nI backed up to that external hard drive.\n\n453\n00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:58,319\nSo I can now take that external hard drive\nout and take it home, or whatever, and\n\n454\n00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,350\nI've got an offsite backup of this system.\n\n455\n00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,517\nSo that's cool, right?\n\n456\n00:24:02,517 --> 00:24:03,226\n>> Did it finish?\n\n457\n00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:05,808\n>> It did finish, yeah.\n\n458\n00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:09,516\nAnd this is the backup part so\nit doesn't show what I actually did.\n\n459\n00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:13,187\nBut we're gonna do system\nrestore after the break,\n\n460\n00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:15,940\nso I don't wanna dive into that yet.\n\n461\n00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,930\nBut what if I have a failure now, right?\n\n462\n00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,250\nSo what if my hard drive dies?\n\n463\n00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,520\nHow do I use this backup,\n\n464\n00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,910\nhow do I use this hard drive\nthat I've got sitting there.\n\n465\n00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:28,580\nWell, what you need to do is you need to\nbuild up what's called a recovery image.\n\n466\n00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,630\nAnd a recovery image it is basically,\n\n467\n00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,240\na special installation of Windows\nthat's designed to do the recovery.\n\n468\n00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,475\nAnd you can do this to a USB key or\nto a CD or DVD.\n\n469\n00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:42,934\nI think It has to be a DVD now,\nit's too big for a CD.\n\n470\n00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:45,680\nSo you can boot off the DVD.\n\n471\n00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,360\nMy laptop here in front of me\ndoesn't have a DVD drive, so\n\n472\n00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,920\nI'm gonna do it to a USB key.\n\n473\n00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,990\nSo I wanna show you guys that and\nthen we'll probably hit time for\n\n474\n00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,670\nbreak on that one.\n\n475\n00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,670\nSo let me just take my computer here and\n\n476\n00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,290\nI'm gonna create that\nsystem recovery disk.\n\n477\n00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,188\nNate has offered up his USB key here for\nme to use.\n\n478\n00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:07,128\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nbasically in Windows 8,\n\n479\n00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:11,850\nI usually just bring up my\nlittle metro/modern UI thing.\n\n480\n00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,506\nAnd in here if you just punch in recovery\nas you search for it you'll find\n\n481\n00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:21,102\nit right there, Create a Recovery Drive\nand that's what I want to do.\n\n482\n00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,074\nThat's gonna create that bootable disk for\nus,\n\n483\n00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:26,785\nthat's gonna let us be able to recover.\n\n484\n00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:27,407\nAll right?\n\n485\n00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:30,297\nSo here it comes up, it says hey, you\ncan use the recovery drive to do stuff,\n\n486\n00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:31,447\nisn't that great?\n\n487\n00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,317\nAnd then, so we'll hit Next.\n\n488\n00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:36,607\nAnd it's gonna get ready to build it,\nand it's looking to see all right,\n\n489\n00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:40,290\ndo I have a DVD drive,\ndo I have a USB key, what do I have?\n\n490\n00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,502\nSo it found my USB drive right there.\n\n491\n00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:45,450\nAnd so,\nI don't really have a lot of choice here.\n\n492\n00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,270\nAnd I'll hit Next.\n\n493\n00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,160\nIt's gonna warn me that it's\ngonna format that drive.\n\n494\n00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,267\nI'm gonna lose any data that's on it\nwhich is why I'm using Nate's USB key.\n\n495\n00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:56,004\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I grabbed mine and just threw it in and\n\n496\n00:25:56,004 --> 00:26:00,002\nit's got a bunch of my wife's\nvacation photos on there and\n\n497\n00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:02,870\npictures of our son being born and stuff.\n\n498\n00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,580\nAnd so you're like, ooh probably\nI don't want to format that one.\n\n499\n00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,240\nIn fact, I have to make sure we\nhave a backup of it somewhere.\n\n500\n00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,810\nIf only there was some\nway I could do a backup.\n\n501\n00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,710\n>> Yeah, I know, an automated backup, that\n>> That would be awesome.\n\n502\n00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,390\nI wonder why somebody hasn't\nthought of that before.\n\n503\n00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,670\nSo anyhow,\nit's gonna build a recovery drive.\n\n504\n00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,830\nIt doesn't take very long.\n\n505\n00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,780\nThe recovery drive doesn't\ncontain any of your data.\n\n506\n00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,710\nIt's actually a generic kinda thing.\n\n507\n00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,840\nIt is loading some of the drivers\nthat are part of your system.\n\n508\n00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,550\nSo it's nice to build your own as oppose\nto using someone else's recovery drive.\n\n509\n00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,240\nSomeone else's recovery drive might\nnot have all the hardware drivers\n\n510\n00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,210\nthat you need.\n\n511\n00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,070\nBut it's going to allow us to\nbe able to reboot our system and\n\n512\n00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,150\nboot up into this limited OS\nmade available by the USB key.\n\n513\n00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:45,570\nAnd then, once we're in there,\nwe can recover from that hard drive.\n\n514\n00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,670\nSo it shouldn't take too long.\n\n515\n00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,010\nAnd then we'll reboot my machine and\nget a chance to see that.\n\n516\n00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,150\nThere we go, it is ready.\n\n517\n00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,400\nSo I'll just finish that, and\nthen I'll just do a reboot here, and\n\n518\n00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,680\nI'm gonna boot off of that.\n\n519\n00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,544\nNow, let me get moved\nover here to the Sky Cam.\n\n520\n00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:10,805\nAnd oh, you know what?\n\n521\n00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:13,970\nI need to hit F12 on the keyboard first.\n\n522\n00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:19,662\n[LAUGH] Aw, I missed it, dadgummit.\n\n523\n00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:22,032\nAll right, let me reboot this.\n\n524\n00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:25,172\nOn a Dell laptop you can press\nF12 to get a boot menu and\n\n525\n00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:29,342\nyou can tell it you want to boot from\nUSB verses hard drive and all that.\n\n526\n00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:33,972\nAnd I missed my opportunity to hit F12,\ncuz I had the tablet flipped around.\n\n527\n00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:36,840\nSo let me just get into that and\nthen we'll boot from that USB key.\n\n528\n00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:41,980\n>> Right on, yep,\nwe'll just run through that.\n\n529\n00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,750\n>> Yeah, just kinda have to wait.\n\n530\n00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,650\nIt's telling me that it's restarting,\nso now we have to be patient.\n\n531\n00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,070\nSo, what if,\nyou don't have this recovery drive?\n\n532\n00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,392\nWhat if you didn't make one?\n\n533\n00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:54,244\nWhat if you have your backup hard drive\nsitting there with all your data, but\n\n534\n00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:55,683\nyou don't have this recovery drive?\n\n535\n00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:57,225\nIt's not the end of the world.\n\n536\n00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:59,270\nI've done a couple of\nthings to get around it.\n\n537\n00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:03,845\nOne easy way is, if you had a failed hard\ndrive, you can replace the hard drive\n\n538\n00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:07,905\nin there and then just do\na default install of Windows 8.\n\n539\n00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:09,345\nJust do a stock install,\n\n540\n00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:12,345\nload your drivers, and\nthen build a recovery image there.\n\n541\n00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:14,090\nThen you've got it and\nyou can boot off of it.\n\n542\n00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:18,125\nOr a lot of times we can just go to\nsomebody else's machine and use there's.\n\n543\n00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,308\n[SOUND] There we go, all right.\n\n544\n00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:23,619\nSo on my laptop here,\nI just fired it up and\n\n545\n00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,879\nI pressed F12 on the keyboard\nto get the boot menu and\n\n546\n00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:33,100\nI told it to boot off the USB disk,\nand now it is just sitting here.\n\n547\n00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,266\nIs it upset that I,\nwe're getting the big studio lights too.\n\n548\n00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:41,100\nOh no, it's booting up.\n\n549\n00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,308\nSo we got our little status message there.\n\n550\n00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:43,609\nNow it's gonna boot up and\n\n551\n00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:46,930\nwe get this screen where it's\nasking me about my keyboard layout.\n\n552\n00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,500\nNow, I've got my laptop\nin tablet mode now so\n\n553\n00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,970\nI'm not sure how happy it's gonna\nbe with this, but we'll see.\n\n554\n00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,820\nThere we go.\n\n555\n00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,870\nSo when I rebooted, this is just\na really limited version of Windows that\n\n556\n00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,830\ngives me the capability\nof restoring the OS.\n\n557\n00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,700\nI don't have my hard drive attached to it,\nbut you'll see when you boot up here we've\n\n558\n00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,310\ngot, troubleshoot your PC,\nor turn off your PC.\n\n559\n00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,220\nAnd if I dive into troubleshoot,\nhere's what I've got, Refresh,\n\n560\n00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,460\nor Reset your PC, Advanced Options.\n\n561\n00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,319\nAnd I'm actually not seeing the recovery\noption here because I don't have that\n\n562\n00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,050\nhard drive backup attached to it.\n\n563\n00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,790\nWe were backing it up\non a different system.\n\n564\n00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,110\nBut normally, I would see that option.\n\n565\n00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,260\nAnd when I go in here I can\nsee like System Restore,\n\n566\n00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,650\nwhich we're gonna talk\nabout after the break.\n\n567\n00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,030\nOh there it is, System Image Recovery.\n\n568\n00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,030\nI do see it.\n\n569\n00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,420\nSo we can go into that\nSystem Image Recovery and\n\n570\n00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,140\nthis is where we would go and pick it.\n\n571\n00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,430\nAnd see here, it's complaining,\nI can't find an image.\n\n572\n00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,480\nIt expects me to have that drive.\n\n573\n00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,330\nAnd, Nate,\ncan we zoom in on this a little more?\n\n574\n00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,070\n>> Yes.\nI was gonna ask you if you wanted that.\n\n575\n00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,130\n>> I can barely read it and\nI'm standing here.\n\n576\n00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,890\nBut it's complaining, it's saying,\n\n577\n00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,430\nhey I can't find that hard drive\nthat's got the back up where is it?\n\n578\n00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,436\nAnd I can attach the drive at\nthis point and hit Retry or\n\n579\n00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:57,850\nI can Cancel and admit failure.\n\n580\n00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,600\nBut basically, it's wanting me\nto select that back up drive.\n\n581\n00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,333\nSo, if I had that drive\nattached I would pick it and\n\n582\n00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:09,280\nthen it would restore the entire system,\nrestore the entire C drive, the EFI boot.\n\n583\n00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,090\nPut all that back in place and\nit's like taking my system back in time.\n\n584\n00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,590\nIf you have a computer that's\ninfected with a virus,\n\n585\n00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,450\nthat's had a failed hard drive,\nor whatever, having a system\n\n586\n00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,445\nimage restore backup it's like a safety\nnet that takes away all the stress.\n\n587\n00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're not freaked out,\n\n588\n00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,100\nhow I'm I going to recover this data.\n\n589\n00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,516\nYou don't have to,\nit's all right there on the drive.\n\n590\n00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:32,520\nSo really,\nif you want a stress-free IT life.\n\n591\n00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,600\nIf you're supporting your computers\nat home, or your mom's computer, or\n\n592\n00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,938\nwhatever, having a system image\nrestore backup is really really cool.\n\n593\n00:30:40,938 --> 00:30:45,540\nThere are tons of third party utilities\nout there like a Acronis True Image,\n\n594\n00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,790\nParagon Drive Backup and\nothers that do this same basic thing,\n\n595\n00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,290\nbut cost a lot of money.\n\n596\n00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,600\nAnd I love Paragon Drive Backup,\nwe use it on some of our servers.\n\n597\n00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,613\nBut on the client side this system\nimage backup, it's built into Windows,\n\n598\n00:31:00,613 --> 00:31:04,641\ndoesn't cost any extra, you can do\nthe backup while the system is running.\n\n599\n00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:05,900\nYou keep using the system.\n\n600\n00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,350\nSo it is really a great system and\n\n601\n00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,650\nall you need is an external drive\nto back up to and a recovery image.\n\n602\n00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:18,750\nWhich you can throw onto a USB key and\nbe in business, so.\n\n603\n00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,840\n>> Yeah, and heck, external hard drives,\n\n604\n00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,175\nI mean they can be had\npretty cheap these days.\n\n605\n00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:29,079\nWe have terabyte external drive these\ndays, I mean it runs just under 100 bucks.\n\n606\n00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,950\nAnd a terabyte should back up\nmost everything on a lot of PCs.\n\n607\n00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,065\nSo, yeah, it's not a rich person's thing.\n\n608\n00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:41,223\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go grab external drives.\n\n609\n00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:42,953\nYeah, not bad.\n\n610\n00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:48,045\n>> Now in the corporate and enterprise\nworld, A lot of times, they'll leverage\n\n611\n00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:53,490\nunified backup solutions, things like\nTivoli backup and stuff like that Archer.\n\n612\n00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,870\nAnd those backup systems, they're nice\ncuz they can be centrally managed.\n\n613\n00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,925\nThey have one management screen, and they\ncan see their thousands of desktops and\n\n614\n00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:01,235\ntheir backup status.\n\n615\n00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:06,505\nThis backup that we just showed you, it's\nreally on an individual machine basis.\n\n616\n00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:10,465\nSo it can be difficult to manage when\nyou have thousands of PCs, all right.\n\n617\n00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:13,557\nSo just keep in mind in the corporate\nworld you may find different solutions\n\n618\n00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,517\nthat are out there.\n\n619\n00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:19,047\nBut, this is what's built into Windows,\ndoesn't cost you a dime extra, and\n\n620\n00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:20,237\nit's what's on the exam.\n\n621\n00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:21,617\nSo it's what we need to know.\n\n622\n00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:24,853\nSymantec Backup Exec is not going\nto show up on the exam, but\n\n623\n00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:26,484\nWindows Image Backups will.\n\n624\n00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:28,259\n>> Well sweet, Don.\n\n625\n00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:30,627\nWe're up on our break here.\n\n626\n00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:31,127\n>> Yep.\n\n627\n00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:37,860\n>> Lets take a break here, and when we\ncome back, we have more recovery stuff,\n\n628\n00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,562\nand yeah, we'll do it some more.\n\n629\n00:32:40,562 --> 00:32:43,382\n>> All right so ladies and gentlemen,\nstay tuned, and more Windows action,\n\n630\n00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:44,289\nafter these messages.\n\n631\n00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:51,428\n[MUSIC]\n\n632\n00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,380\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n633\n00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,950\nSorry for the delay on the break there.\n\n634\n00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,100\nThere's actually an internet\nbackbone issue going on right now.\n\n635\n00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,170\nWhich it doesn't seem to be affecting\nour stream, so that's cool that we're\n\n636\n00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,420\nnot affected, but some providers\naren't able to get to the website.\n\n637\n00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,586\nSo we had to kind of troubleshoot that,\nfigure out what the heck was going on.\n\n638\n00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:15,414\nBut this follows into the NMP category,\nthe not my problem.\n\n639\n00:33:15,414 --> 00:33:17,923\n>> [LAUGH] I was trying to run\nthrough my head and like, oh my gosh,\n\n640\n00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:18,856\ndo we talk about this?\n\n641\n00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:19,703\n>> [LAUGH] We didn't.\n\n642\n00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:22,558\nOr the SEP, the upgraded version,\nthe somebody else's problem.\n\n643\n00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,066\n>> We did like, protocols yesterday.\n\n644\n00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:25,970\n>> Lots of acronyms.\n\n645\n00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,390\n>> And I'm like wait a minute,\nwait a minute, NMP, NMP, I don't remember.\n\n646\n00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,600\nRemember that old thing.\n\n647\n00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,410\n>> Yep, that's the.\n\n648\n00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,370\n>> Don't call on me.\n\n649\n00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,889\n>> Not my problem version 2.0.\n\n650\n00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:33,770\n>> All right.\n\n651\n00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,810\n>> All right, so we left off talking\nabout some of the cool backup and\n\n652\n00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:42,170\nrestore stuff in Windows 7, Windows 8,\nwhatever product it is we're using today.\n\n653\n00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:46,190\nAnd what we were showing you\nwas stuff that was awesome\n\n654\n00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,320\nin the event they had a hard\ndrive failure, right?\n\n655\n00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,250\nAnd it takes a long time\nto do the backups, and\n\n656\n00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,950\nthe restores take just as long and\nit requires an external drive.\n\n657\n00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,270\nNow we're gonna switch gears and\n\n658\n00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,460\ntake a look at some stuff that won't\nprotect you from a hard drive failure but\n\n659\n00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,610\nwill protect you from overwriting files,\ndeleting files, or whatever.\n\n660\n00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,810\nThese are very easy to implement,\nvery quick to implement, and\n\n661\n00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,010\nthere is very, very little reason for\nsomebody not to use these tools.\n\n662\n00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,730\nThey're built in,\n\n663\n00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,030\nwe just need to turn them on, and\nthey'll help make our system more stable.\n\n664\n00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,250\nI say very little reason\nbecause I turn it off at night.\n\n665\n00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:16,761\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n666\n00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:20,816\nDon, I was just gonna bring that up, but\nnow you've taken that whole other thing.\n\n667\n00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:21,781\n>> I've ruined it.\n\n668\n00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:23,850\n>> I was about to say, oh but, Don.\n\n669\n00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,130\nBut-\n>> Do you use it on yours?\n\n670\n00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,160\n>> No.\nWell no, well not.\n\n671\n00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,499\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's SSD.\n\n672\n00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,865\n>> That's a good point.\n\n673\n00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:31,050\n>> [CROSSTALK] It goes, anyways.\n\n674\n00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,480\n>> So you might be wondering,\nwhat the heck are we bantering here.\n\n675\n00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,880\nWell inside of Windows 8 and really,\nWindows 7, which is why I said that\n\n676\n00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,850\na minute ago, but inside of Windows 8,\nyou've got a functional system restore.\n\n677\n00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:47,210\nAnd system restore leverages that same\nvolume shadow copy service I mentioned\n\n678\n00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,500\nearlier in the show to be able\nto make snapshots of your files.\n\n679\n00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,200\nAnd it's really cool because if you delete\na file, and you're running system restore,\n\n680\n00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,950\nthen it doesn't actually delete the file.\n\n681\n00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,340\nIt marks it as deleted, it's hidden,\nyou can't see it anymore, but\n\n682\n00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,270\nthe file is still there on the hard drive.\n\n683\n00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,260\nAnd that means that you can\nrecover it if you need to.\n\n684\n00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,020\nAnd every time you change a file,\ninstead of overwriting the old one,\n\n685\n00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,460\nit just writes your changes to\nanother area on the hard drive.\n\n686\n00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,060\nSo you've got the original file,\nfully intact, and the changes.\n\n687\n00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,320\nYou only see the changes, but if you want\nto you could roll back the original file.\n\n688\n00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,880\nSounds really cool, doesn't it.\n\n689\n00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,760\nWell, pros and cons, right?\n\n690\n00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,980\nThe biggest con is,\nnot a con job, con artist,\n\n691\n00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,140\nbut the con as in the negative is\nthat it takes up hard drive space.\n\n692\n00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,220\nRight?\nAll these extra copies of files,\n\n693\n00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,090\nall these change log entries that get\nmade, it takes up hard drive space.\n\n694\n00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:37,900\nIt's there.\n\n695\n00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,430\nAnd it can create a slight\nperformance impact, it's not much.\n\n696\n00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:47,040\nBut I normally turn it off,\nbecause I value my hard drive space.\n\n697\n00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,640\nBut you can actually control that.\n\n698\n00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,850\nIf you are on a desktop computer and\n\n699\n00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,380\nyou got a terabyte hard drive\nthen you don't care about it.\n\n700\n00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:57,650\nBut like on my laptop, I've only got\na 256 gig SSD, space is a premium.\n\n701\n00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,541\nI don't like to waste it\non things like back-ups.\n\n702\n00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:04,630\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, system restore.\n\n703\n00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,308\nWell should we fire the guy up and\nrun through the little menus-\n\n704\n00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:08,947\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n705\n00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:10,170\n>> And walk around in it.\n\n706\n00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,820\n>> So there's a few ways to set it up.\n\n707\n00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,800\nThe way I go,\nis I go into the system control panel.\n\n708\n00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,760\nDo you use that?\n\n709\n00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,260\nOr do you use the modern UI stuff?\n\n710\n00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,199\n>> What, no.\nYes, I go through system properties\n\n711\n00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,280\n>> Okay.\n\n712\n00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,340\nSo one of the easiest ways is if we\nuse our Windows key x shortcut and\n\n713\n00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,420\ngo into the system panel here.\n\n714\n00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,770\nInside of the System and\n\n715\n00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,490\nSecurity panel, you'll see\nSystem Protection on the left side.\n\n716\n00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,890\nSystem protection is\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n717\n00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,380\nThis is where it monitors your files,\nmakes a backup,\n\n718\n00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,650\nand keeps that backup copy so\nthat you can recover if needed.\n\n719\n00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,209\nAnd actually it looks like\nit's on is it on by default or\n\n720\n00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:46,554\ndid you have to turn that on?\n\n721\n00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,073\n>> No.\n\n722\n00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:52,929\nSystem restore it is indeed on by\ndefault and yeah, so it's always there.\n\n723\n00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:54,680\nYeah, getting your back.\n\n724\n00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,550\nOf course, you can go in and\nturn it off, but yeah, on by default.\n\n725\n00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,210\n>> Okay.\n\n726\n00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,810\nSo I can see here on the C Drive.\n\n727\n00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,900\nIs it turned on and\noff on a drive by drive basis.\n\n728\n00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,440\nSo on the C drive it's turned on.\n\n729\n00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,910\nOn the E drive it's off because\nI'm using that as the backup.\n\n730\n00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,390\nRemember the system image\nwe did on the last segment,\n\n731\n00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,280\nthat's there on the E drive and\nthat's why it's not showing up there.\n\n732\n00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,000\nBy default, it sets a schedule,\nlet's see if I can remember this and\n\n733\n00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,300\nthen we'll verify.\n\n734\n00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,116\nIt says a schedule where it takes\na snapshot of your computer twice a day,\n\n735\n00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,930\n7 a.m and noon.\n\n736\n00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,470\nLet's make sure that's right.\n\n737\n00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,940\nLet's see if I can show\noff my crazy memory.\n\n738\n00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,400\nDo we not see the scheduler any more?\n\n739\n00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,329\nIs it going to make me go into\nthe task scheduler to figure it out?\n\n740\n00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,490\nIt is.\n\n741\n00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,640\nSo, anyhow,\nthe default schedule is 7 a.m and noon.\n\n742\n00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,470\nThe idea is that it does it at 7 a.m,\n\n743\n00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,780\nthe beginning of the day, and then you\nstart your work and you do things.\n\n744\n00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,750\nAnd at noon, halfway through your day,\nit does another snapshot, right?\n\n745\n00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,876\nAnd then you end your day.\n\n746\n00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:53,490\nSo when you kinda work you really have\nonly half a day of data that you can\n\n747\n00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,000\ntruly risk to lose.\n\n748\n00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,530\nBut, it's taking these snapshots and\nthey build up over time, right?\n\n749\n00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,760\nSo the more snapshots you have\nthe more hard drive they consume.\n\n750\n00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,300\nThen that's why we might wanna go in and\n\n751\n00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,460\nconfigure it to limit the amount\nof space that it could consume.\n\n752\n00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,234\nSo, looking at this machine\nit's set to 3% of the drive or\n\n753\n00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:12,610\n1.78 GB is allows to be used for copies.\n\n754\n00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,882\nIf I get too much, it'll start to\noverwrite the older stuff, and\n\n755\n00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:18,631\nwe can crank that up or\ncrank it down based on our needs.\n\n756\n00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:23,299\nI might want more or\nless depending on my system, right?\n\n757\n00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,141\nSo maybe I wanna bump it up to 5%,\n\n758\n00:38:26,141 --> 00:38:30,557\nif I can get the little slider onto 5%,\nthere we go.\n\n759\n00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:34,792\nAnd then that'll give me some extra\nroom so now I've got 2.97 gigs.\n\n760\n00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:37,973\nIt's already using 1 gig and\nI've barely done anything to the system.\n\n761\n00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:39,425\n>> Yeah.\n\n762\n00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:46,784\nAnd of course so\nthis works on the entire partition here.\n\n763\n00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:51,189\nSo you can't select what copies or\nbacks up or what not so\n\n764\n00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:55,340\nI guess that what file\nhistory would be for.\n\n765\n00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,400\nTo grab those individual files, this\nright here will do it, the whole drive.\n\n766\n00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,240\n>> You know another thing,\nspeaking of file history.\n\n767\n00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,660\nFile history will work on FAT32 drives,\n\n768\n00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,630\nsince you're backing up\nto another location.\n\n769\n00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:11,040\nBut this type of system restore,\nit requires NTFS.\n\n770\n00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,920\nSo you do have to have\nan NTFS formatted drive.\n\n771\n00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,030\nAlmost everybody does these days, but\njust be aware of that requirement.\n\n772\n00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,920\nIf I didn't want to use it, like on my\nown laptop here, you can choose Disable.\n\n773\n00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,810\nThat will turn it off,\nit'll delete the copies, and that's it.\n\n774\n00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:29,510\nYou've got real-time right now, and\nif you delete something tough luck, right?\n\n775\n00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,887\nAll right, now, the cool part about this,\nonce it's there,\n\n776\n00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:37,314\nit's running it's taking these automatic\nsnapshots or you can create your own.\n\n777\n00:39:37,314 --> 00:39:42,556\nWhen you perform major activities on\nthe system, installing Windows updates,\n\n778\n00:39:42,556 --> 00:39:47,658\nupdating a driver, It will take a system\nrestore snapshot right then, okay.\n\n779\n00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:49,810\nOr you can go in and do them yourself.\n\n780\n00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,820\nYou see this Create button right here.\n\n781\n00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,930\nSo I can tell it to create and\n\n782\n00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,270\nit will create a snapshot right now,\nduring the show.\n\n783\n00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,040\nSo I can create that snapshot.\n\n784\n00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,580\nSo it's now creating a restore point,\n\n785\n00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,540\nand that restore point\nincludes everything, right?\n\n786\n00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,580\nNot just our files on the hard drive,\n\n787\n00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,370\nbut the drivers that we have loaded,\nour registry settings.\n\n788\n00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,370\nThese are all things that can be rolled\nback in the event that a problem occurs.\n\n789\n00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:19,150\n>> Now, Don, if I'm not mistaken,\nso having this turned on gives the,\n\n790\n00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,102\nthat's about history,\nthe Previous Versions tab.\n\n791\n00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:25,720\nIt was turned off in that\nPrevious Versions tab, and\n\n792\n00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,600\nyour file properties goes away.\n\n793\n00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,370\n>> You should have, with System Restore,\nyou should have previous versions.\n\n794\n00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:36,030\nThat Previous Versions tab that Nate\nis talking about, it's a weird one.\n\n795\n00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,270\nSo for example,\nif I browse into my C drive and\n\n796\n00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:44,030\nactually let me go into my,\nwe'll go in Downloads here.\n\n797\n00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:48,770\nSo if you pull up the Properties for\na folder, if you've got a file history,\n\n798\n00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,240\nyou'll see a Previous Versions tab.\n\n799\n00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,510\nNow, I've noticed this.\n\n800\n00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,240\nThis is a carryover from the old\ndays of Volume Shadow Copy.\n\n801\n00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,950\nSometimes the tabs shows up,\nsometimes it doesn't, right?\n\n802\n00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:01,030\nAnd the theory is if you don't\nhave Volume Shadow Copy turned on,\n\n803\n00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,230\nif you don't have these previous versions,\nthen you don't need to see the tab.\n\n804\n00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:08,390\nBut another thing is sometimes they\nonly show up when you access the drive\n\n805\n00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,990\nvia a UNC.\n\n806\n00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,897\nSo for example,\nif I was to browse to ITPROTV/CL1/C$,\n\n807\n00:41:14,897 --> 00:41:21,150\nright, browsing into my hard\ndrive via a network share,\n\n808\n00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,480\nand I go into my Don folder, and\nwhat did I do a second ago, Downloads?\n\n809\n00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,520\nAnd I pull up the Properties for\n\n810\n00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,270\nDownloads, there's that Previous Versions\ntab, and now I can get at it, okay.\n\n811\n00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,120\nSo, it's a weird thing.\n\n812\n00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,990\nI don't really know how\nMicrosoft determines\n\n813\n00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,780\nwhen to show the Previous Versions tab and\nwhen not to.\n\n814\n00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,408\nWhen you're browsing via the Windows\nExplorer, sometimes you see it,\n\n815\n00:41:41,408 --> 00:41:42,277\nsometimes you don't.\n\n816\n00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:45,954\nWhen you browse via a UNC though,\nyou always see it.\n\n817\n00:41:45,954 --> 00:41:50,170\nAnd so, assuming it's turned on, and\nso that's kind of what I've done.\n\n818\n00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,800\nOver the years, I've just said screw it,\nI'll just use a UNC.\n\n819\n00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,881\nAnd if I want to restore something,\nI browse that way, not very convenient for\n\n820\n00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:56,805\na home user, though.\n\n821\n00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,399\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n822\n00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,760\nRight on.\n\n823\n00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,579\n>> But yeah, in fact,\nthere's that snapshot that I did, 9:49 AM,\n\n824\n00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:07,880\nthat's not the snapshot that I did, is it,\nbecause I did it just a few minutes ago.\n\n825\n00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,406\nSo anyhow, [LAUGH] so\nit's showing that one there.\n\n826\n00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:13,626\nAnd then as we continue to go on tomorrow,\nthe next day, the next day,\n\n827\n00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,550\nit will continue to make more snapshots.\n\n828\n00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,061\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n829\n00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:19,018\nYeah, and that must have been your file\nhistory, cuz the ID you turned on-\n\n830\n00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:19,665\n>> Oh, yeah, from earlier.\n\n831\n00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:20,930\n>> Yep, file history, so yeah.\n\n832\n00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,100\nI guess that, yeah, so there you go.\n\n833\n00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,270\nThere's your file history, Don.\n\n834\n00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,460\n>> All right, excellent.\n\n835\n00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,250\nYou know, the cool part about\nthis is you see the files.\n\n836\n00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,330\nAnd you can restore them.\n\n837\n00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,080\nSo you can restore them\nback to the hard drive and\n\n838\n00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,920\nit'll overwrite what's there now.\n\n839\n00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,850\nOr you can choose to open it, and\nnow you can grab that copy and\n\n840\n00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,590\ncopy it wherever you want.\n\n841\n00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,870\nAnd you can maintain your current version\nand the old version side by side.\n\n842\n00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,220\nThat's really useful if you\nhave a Word document and\n\n843\n00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,930\nyou wanna get some of the words out of\nit and not overwrite what's current.\n\n844\n00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,960\nSo really, really powerful stuff.\n\n845\n00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,210\nWhere it gets even more powerful, though,\nis when it can system restore the whole\n\n846\n00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:01,450\nmachine, the whole doggone thing\nin the event that you get a virus,\n\n847\n00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,940\nyou delete some stuff, things go crazy,\nthat you can go in and\n\n848\n00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,376\nrestore to that system restore point,\nokay.\n\n849\n00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,859\nSo, for example, let's say I'm working and\nI decide these icons on my desktop,\n\n850\n00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:17,590\nI don't need Zen Map and I don't need my\nMicrosoft Baseline Security analyzer.\n\n851\n00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,210\nI'm just gonna get rid of those.\n\n852\n00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,770\nAnd so you start removing some things.\n\n853\n00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,710\nI'll empty my recycle bin.\n\n854\n00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,390\nLet's get that out of there.\n\n855\n00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,290\nSo that data is gone, right.\n\n856\n00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:31,630\nAnd then I realize later, I'm like,\noh no, that was real important stuff.\n\n857\n00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,280\nI need that back.\n\n858\n00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,810\nWell, if you don't have a backup,\nyou're kinda screwed, aren't you?\n\n859\n00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,490\nBut if you do have a backup, well,\nwe've got our system image from earlier.\n\n860\n00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,560\nWe could restore the whole\ncomputer that way.\n\n861\n00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,950\nBut because we have a restore point\nwe can just roll right back to that\n\n862\n00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:47,440\nrestore point and we'll be in business.\n\n863\n00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,020\nIt'll put things back to\nthe way that they were, right?\n\n864\n00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:57,130\nAnd that was an option right in there if I\ngo back to System and System Protection.\n\n865\n00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,190\nRight here,\nyou've got that System Restore button.\n\n866\n00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,090\nAnd it's pretty cool because it'll\ngive you a list of your restore\n\n867\n00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,790\npoints cuz you may have more than one.\n\n868\n00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,670\nAnd you can just pick the restore\npoint and roll right back to it.\n\n869\n00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,252\nSo there's the one,\nthe automatic one at 9:49 and\n\n870\n00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:11,740\nthen there's the one that\nI did just a moment ago.\n\n871\n00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,340\nOh, I know why the other one didn't\nshow up in the Downloads folder,\n\n872\n00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,370\nnothing changed.\n\n873\n00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,860\nThere was no change.\n\n874\n00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,670\nRemember when we do these restore points,\nit's only keeping track of what changed.\n\n875\n00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,578\nThat Download folder hadn't changed\nsince my initial backup point.\n\n876\n00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,741\nThat's why there wasn't that second one,\nthat's why it was missing.\n\n877\n00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:30,900\nBut, so I can just choose this one.\n\n878\n00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,140\nAnd I can choose to restore it.\n\n879\n00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,810\nYou'll see this Show more restore points.\n\n880\n00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,451\nSo I've got some from earlier like\nwhen some updates were installed or\n\n881\n00:44:38,451 --> 00:44:40,062\nwhen the machine was created.\n\n882\n00:44:40,062 --> 00:44:43,166\nSo, those are out there, but\nby default it shows the newer ones.\n\n883\n00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:46,188\n>> Mm-hm, and the System Restore CS.\n\n884\n00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:51,950\nSo after, or not after,\nbefore a major system change,\n\n885\n00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:57,950\nWindows will automatically create these\nsystem restores for driver installs,\n\n886\n00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:03,730\nprogram installs, things that\nare modifying the system files.\n\n887\n00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,800\nWindows will make a restore\npoint before those changes, and\n\n888\n00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,300\nin the event it does hose up the system.\n\n889\n00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,140\n>> Yeah.\n\n890\n00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,870\nAnd so here I went ahead and\nchose to restore the restore point.\n\n891\n00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:18,240\nAnd what it's doing is it's going and\nfinding all those files that were flagged\n\n892\n00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,140\nas deleted, or all those files that had\nchanges, and it's just removing the flag.\n\n893\n00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,425\nSo it's saying this file\nisn't deleted anymore, or\n\n894\n00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:27,690\nthese changes are no longer attached,\nso we're back to the original file.\n\n895\n00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,322\nIt does require a reboot, but\n\n896\n00:45:29,322 --> 00:45:33,846\nit is considerably faster than restoring\noff of one of those hard drives, right?\n\n897\n00:45:33,846 --> 00:45:38,763\nIt took a good 15 or 20 minutes to do\nthe system image backup earlier, but this,\n\n898\n00:45:38,763 --> 00:45:43,476\nit's actually almost done so it's gonna\nfinish doing this initialization and\n\n899\n00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:45,042\nthen it's gonna reboot.\n\n900\n00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,742\nAnd my system will be rolled back.\n\n901\n00:45:46,742 --> 00:45:49,069\nNow, there are some\nimportant caveats here.\n\n902\n00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:51,607\nWhen you do a system restore,\nif there's documents\n\n903\n00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:55,011\nin your My Documents folder that are new,\nthat didn't exist before,\n\n904\n00:45:55,011 --> 00:45:58,606\nit'll actually leave those there,\nconsidering them as new documents.\n\n905\n00:45:58,606 --> 00:46:00,745\nSo there are some things\nthat it'll preserve for\n\n906\n00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:02,581\nyou because it knows you might need them.\n\n907\n00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:05,928\nBut if there were existing files that were\nthere that are also a part of the backup,\n\n908\n00:46:05,928 --> 00:46:06,911\nit will recover those.\n\n909\n00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:09,810\nSo, if you made a lot of\nchanges since the restore,\n\n910\n00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,729\nthe system restore point was made,\nyou may actually lose some data.\n\n911\n00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,518\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n912\n00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:19,644\nYeah, now, Don, now System Restore,\nif I'm not mistaken,\n\n913\n00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:26,260\nit does not grab your personal files,\nlike documents or pictures or anything.\n\n914\n00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:30,710\nIt only does your system files,\nyour register settings,\n\n915\n00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,240\ndrivers, and that sort of thing.\n\n916\n00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,670\nSo if you did have some pictures and\ndeleted them out,\n\n917\n00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,970\nSystem Restore shouldn't grab those files.\n\n918\n00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:44,410\n>> So it does grab them, but\nit doesn't restore them.\n\n919\n00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,740\nAnd that's because you've got that option\nof just going to the previous versions and\n\n920\n00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,580\nloading them back that way.\n\n921\n00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:53,160\nSo you can use your discretion to say,\nhere's these new photos I took of\n\n922\n00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,880\nthe family and I don't wanna lose those\ncuz I went back to a restore point.\n\n923\n00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,086\nSo you get control over that.\n\n924\n00:46:57,086 --> 00:46:58,800\nAnd if you've got a virus or something,\n\n925\n00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,000\nit's not normally infecting stuff\nthat's in your My Documents folder, so\n\n926\n00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,070\nthat's why it excludes that and\nso it won't be a part of that.\n\n927\n00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,240\nAnd now that I think about it, my example\nhere, I deleted some desktop icons.\n\n928\n00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,260\nI'm not entirely sure it's\ngonna put those back.\n\n929\n00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:16,870\nSo if it doesn't, I'll have to\nput the previous version back.\n\n930\n00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,960\nSo, easy enough to restore that.\n\n931\n00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,810\nBut if I had changed some drivers, if i\nhad started messing with stuff like that,\n\n932\n00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,860\nthat is all getting put back.\n\n933\n00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,960\nAnd if we look at my screen right now,\n\n934\n00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,260\nit's still kind of running though its\nthing but it says here Windows files and\n\n935\n00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:34,550\nsettings are being restored, System\nRestore is restoring the registry, right?\n\n936\n00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,957\nSo if I updated drivers,\nthose are registry changes,\n\n937\n00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:38,538\nso those are now being rolled back.\n\n938\n00:47:38,538 --> 00:47:41,816\nIf I had updated Windows files,\nif I had done Windows updates and stuff,\n\n939\n00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:43,180\nthose are being rolled back.\n\n940\n00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,857\nThis is all part of that process.\n\n941\n00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:47,545\nI'm trying to get my machine\nback to a happy place,\n\n942\n00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:49,929\nback to a place where\nit actually functions.\n\n943\n00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:56,040\n>> Now Don, so you launched the system\nrestore from inside Windows 8.\n\n944\n00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,256\nLet's say your computer, you're locked\nout, you changed a graphics driver or\n\n945\n00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:04,290\nsomething and Windows,\nyou're unable to to load into Windows.\n\n946\n00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:09,400\nSystem restore can also be launched from\nthe advanced startup options, with Windows\n\n947\n00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:15,360\n8 with the little F8 Menu, or getting in-\n>> Is that built-in in Windows 8?\n\n948\n00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,840\nCuz remember in Windows 7,\nyou used to pop the disc in, and\n\n949\n00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,790\nrun that special command\nto get it included?\n\n950\n00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,130\nIs it Is it included in\nWindows 8 by default?\n\n951\n00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,400\n>> It is in there.\n\n952\n00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,820\nIt's turned off by default.\n\n953\n00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,740\nI mean, you have to change a little\nflag to get that option back.\n\n954\n00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,085\n>> So you do have to do that?\n\n955\n00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:32,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What I've done in the past,\n\n956\n00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,630\ncuz I can never remember that flag\nwhich is why I was asking you [LAUGH].\n\n957\n00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,170\nI can never remember the daggum thing.\n\n958\n00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,190\nSo if I can't get into the system, and\n\n959\n00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:44,470\nI want to do a system restore,\nI'll normally keep a Windows 8 disk handy.\n\n960\n00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,060\nIf you've got the DVD and you boot from\nthat, when you boot up from the DVD,\n\n961\n00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,970\ninstead of installing,\nyou can choose the advanced options and\n\n962\n00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,630\nit'll let you run a restore\npoint right from the disk.\n\n963\n00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,910\nSo you've got that option as well.\n\n964\n00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,130\nSo you've got a couple of\ndifferent choices there.\n\n965\n00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:03,370\n>> And yeah, a good thing that\nyou made that little Windows 8,\n\n966\n00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,130\nlittle startup disk from earlier.\n\n967\n00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:10,250\nIn the options with that, yeah,\nbecause we had the system restore and\n\n968\n00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,710\nthen the system image recovery.\n\n969\n00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:18,190\nSo if you don't have your\nWindows 8 factory disk.\n\n970\n00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,690\n>> Yeah, if you bought a Dell or an HP,\nand they didn't send you the disk.\n\n971\n00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:22,670\nI hate it when they do that.\n\n972\n00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,065\nYou paid for the software.\n\n973\n00:49:24,065 --> 00:49:24,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n974\n00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,230\n>> They send you the $2.00 disk,\nor whatever.\n\n975\n00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:31,070\n>> Back in the day, I had a Sony Vaio,\nand when I bought that Sony Vaio,\n\n976\n00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:35,270\nI think with eight CDs of all,\nto reinstall everything, and\n\n977\n00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:40,596\nall the system software, yeah, these days\nthey just don't pass those things out.\n\n978\n00:49:40,596 --> 00:49:41,202\n>> You know what?\n\n979\n00:49:41,202 --> 00:49:42,790\nLenovo.\nLenovo still includes\n\n980\n00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,100\nthe operating system disks with their\nsystems, they still do that, but\n\n981\n00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,132\na lot of the other vendors don't.\n\n982\n00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:52,150\nAll right, look at that, so my system\nrestore just finished, the system booted\n\n983\n00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,440\nup, and I got a little pop-up here telling\nme, System Restore completed successfully.\n\n984\n00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,490\nI'm now back to how things were.\n\n985\n00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,550\nAnd it restored my desktop Icon.\n\n986\n00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:01,730\nSo there they are.\n\n987\n00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:06,660\nI've got my baseline security analyzer and\nmy zen map GUI are both right back there.\n\n988\n00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,240\nThings are back to they way they were.\n\n989\n00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,110\nSo, very cool.\n\n990\n00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,440\nI didn't have to go find some USB\nhard drive or key or whatever.\n\n991\n00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,110\nI didn't need any external devices,\nit was all right here.\n\n992\n00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:20,100\nNow, the reason I mentioned that,\nif my hard drive failed,\n\n993\n00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,330\nthis is not a replacement for backup.\n\n994\n00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,160\nAnd this shows up on the exam a lot.\n\n995\n00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,370\nSystem restore points are not\na replacement for backups.\n\n996\n00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,540\nIf your hard drive fails,\nyou lose your system restore points.\n\n997\n00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,310\nThey're stored on the same drive\nas the data you're backing up.\n\n998\n00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:39,490\nSo while they're convenient, they make\nit really easy to fix a system and\n\n999\n00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:44,410\nget it back up and running,\nit's not a replacement for backups.\n\n1000\n00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,980\nBut, a little side story.\n\n1001\n00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,370\nDo you remember Shelly,\nShelly had a computer.\n\n1002\n00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,210\nShelly, one of the ladies\nhere at the office,\n\n1003\n00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,900\nshe had a computer that was\njust overrun with viruses.\n\n1004\n00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,470\nEvery internet toolbar possible\nwas installed in her machine.\n\n1005\n00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:59,725\nIt was a madhouse.\n\n1006\n00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:05,180\n[LAUGH] And I asked you to work on it and\nyou asked me if I had a back-up.\n\n1007\n00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:09,020\nAnd I said not, cuz it's Shelly,\nwhat do I care.\n\n1008\n00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,230\n[LAUGH] But the thing that I said was,\nsee if she's got a restore point.\n\n1009\n00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,870\nBecause it's a heck of a lot faster.\n\n1010\n00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:18,230\nYou can just hit that restore point and\nthe system can be restored.\n\n1011\n00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,380\nViruses are gone.\n\n1012\n00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,990\nYou're back in business, and\njust very very quick and easy.\n\n1013\n00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:25,830\nIt beats the heck out of\nspending hours trying to clean\n\n1014\n00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,535\nup a system that you\nprobably can't clean up.\n\n1015\n00:51:27,535 --> 00:51:28,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1016\n00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:29,950\nYup, that's right.\n\n1017\n00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,040\nYeah, I do remember that.\n\n1018\n00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,505\nI was in the beginning of my\nyoung little tech support.\n\n1019\n00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:35,570\n>> [LAUGH] Early days.\n\n1020\n00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,820\n>> And I was like, oh my gosh,\nI'm going to sanitize this machine and\n\n1021\n00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,100\neverything and yeah,\nthey were like, no, no, no.\n\n1022\n00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,850\nIf you spend that much time on that\ncomputer, we're going to you know.\n\n1023\n00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,240\n>> Yeah.\n>> You better not spend that much time.\n\n1024\n00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,610\nJust system restore,\ncall it a day, and move on.\n\n1025\n00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,300\n>> You know, I've changed over the years.\n\n1026\n00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,310\nWhen I first got started,\n\n1027\n00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,450\nif I had to work on a computer for four\nhours to get it cleaned up, I'd do it.\n\n1028\n00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,140\nI'd work on it for four hours.\n\n1029\n00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,944\nNowadays, if it's going\nto take more than like,\n\n1030\n00:51:57,944 --> 00:52:02,270\n15 minutes, I'd just say screw it,\nformat, do you have a back up?\n\n1031\n00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,010\nWell, that's your own fault.\n\n1032\n00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,345\nI just don't have that kind of time\nanymore, and in a lot of enterprise,\n\n1033\n00:52:08,345 --> 00:52:12,130\ncorporate environments,\nthey don't back up work stations.\n\n1034\n00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,460\nThey don't back up laptops and desktops.\n\n1035\n00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,020\nBecause they have an image\nof a default laptop or\n\n1036\n00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,040\ndesktop, and if your computer's acting up,\nthey just reimage it.\n\n1037\n00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,890\nAnd you're supposed to store all\nyour files on a network share, and\n\n1038\n00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,780\nthat's what we do here.\n\n1039\n00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,743\nWe've got that network share,\npeople store data to.\n\n1040\n00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:30,660\nAnd so in theory you should be able\nto lose your entire computer, but\n\n1041\n00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,285\nall your data is safe\non the network channel.\n\n1042\n00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:38,118\n>> Yeah, sweet so,\nI mean that's System Restore, right?\n\n1043\n00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:42,280\n>> Yes, and we have just enough time,\nlet's talk about one other possibility.\n\n1044\n00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,240\nAs a part of that system restore,\nit rolled back our registry,\n\n1045\n00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,760\nwhich was pretty cool, but what if we\njust need to roll back the registry?\n\n1046\n00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,020\nCuz when we do a system restore,\nit also rolled back our file system, and\n\n1047\n00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,310\na bunch of other things.\n\n1048\n00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:01,340\nIf I just loaded a bad driver,\nthere's actually a way for us to roll back\n\n1049\n00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,740\njust our registry to the last time that\nwe had a good functioning registry.\n\n1050\n00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,450\nRight?\n\n1051\n00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,080\n>> I believe, Don, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n1052\n00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,820\nyou are talking about the last\nknown good configuration.\n\n1053\n00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,690\n>> That's it.\n\n1054\n00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,160\nYeah, last known good.\n\n1055\n00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,170\nThat would also be in\nthe advanced startup option.\n\n1056\n00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:25,640\nAnd yeah, that guy just moves\nback the registry settings\n\n1057\n00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,450\nchanged on there and\nnot all those files and whatnot.\n\n1058\n00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,290\nQuick and easy.\n\n1059\n00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,680\n>> Let's see, I'm running Windows\n8.1 here in a virtual machine,\n\n1060\n00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,210\nI'm not sure if I'll be able\nto be fast enough to catch it.\n\n1061\n00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:41,860\nSo the advanced startup menu that\nNate was talking about, basically,\n\n1062\n00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:46,950\nwhen you reboot a system,\nright after the BIOS screen,\n\n1063\n00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,680\nbut, [LAUGH] did I just reboot the host?\n\n1064\n00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,250\nI did.\n\n1065\n00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:51,865\nDadgummit!\n\n1066\n00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:52,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1067\n00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:58,080\nWell, right after the bios screen\ncomes up, you get an opportunity\n\n1068\n00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,740\nto press F8 on your keyboard, and you\nget your advanced menu, and let me see.\n\n1069\n00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,130\nHopefully I didn't reboot the host.\n\n1070\n00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:05,720\nOh, I did.\n\n1071\n00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,630\nDag gummit.\n\n1072\n00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:11,210\nAlright, well, you know what, maybe\nwe'll do that after the break then since\n\n1073\n00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,710\nif I reboot my laptop I\ndon't have a way to show it.\n\n1074\n00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,240\nWell, actually we can go sky cam.\n\n1075\n00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,360\nJason, are we still geared up for\nthe sky cam?\n\n1076\n00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,520\nLet's do that.\n\n1077\n00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,330\nHere, we'll just use my actual laptop.\n\n1078\n00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:27,686\nYou know,\nactually I'm gonna reboot it anyway, so\n\n1079\n00:54:27,686 --> 00:54:29,458\nI guess I don't really\nneed all these cables.\n\n1080\n00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:31,626\nBut let's get this up on the sky cam.\n\n1081\n00:54:31,626 --> 00:54:34,110\nAnd when you boot your computer up,\nyou don't have a lot of time.\n\n1082\n00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:37,400\nTo do it,\nyou get your BIOS screen and, Nate,\n\n1083\n00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,080\ncan you zoom that out just a little bit?\n\n1084\n00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,740\n>> Oh yeah, oh, you know what, Don?\n\n1085\n00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,430\nYeah, I can, and let's,\nbefore you push on that,\n\n1086\n00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:46,709\nlet's try a different route just for\nthe fun of it.\n\n1087\n00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:48,970\n>> Oh.\n>> Da, da,da.\n\n1088\n00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,490\n[LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n1089\n00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,760\nThat's good right there.\n\n1090\n00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,440\nOkay.\n\n1091\n00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,980\n>> Alright so\nlet's go to Change PC Settings.\n\n1092\n00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:04,410\nAnd in here, go to our General, and\n\n1093\n00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:09,819\nlet's do Advanced Startup, restart now.\n\n1094\n00:55:09,819 --> 00:55:15,450\nAnd what that should do, is take you\nright into this menu where you then\n\n1095\n00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:22,770\ncan go into here, go into here,\nand da da da, startup settings.\n\n1096\n00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:25,610\nAnd it should restart, and\n\n1097\n00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:29,120\nthen get you into that menu where you\ncan choose it if I'm not mistaken.\n\n1098\n00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,154\n>> All right, let's find out.\n\n1099\n00:55:30,154 --> 00:55:34,713\nSo that the easier way, if you don't\nremember all the stuff that Nate just did,\n\n1100\n00:55:34,713 --> 00:55:38,185\nis as you're booting up\nthe computer after the BIOS screen,\n\n1101\n00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:40,586\nyou just tap the F8 key on your keyboard.\n\n1102\n00:55:40,586 --> 00:55:45,520\nAnd when you reboot you'll get a menu that\nis not like this one, so let's restart.\n\n1103\n00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:48,750\nOr is it just F10 to get that?\n\n1104\n00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,770\nNo, let's just restart.\n\n1105\n00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,880\nAll right, so I'm gonna try here.\n\n1106\n00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,165\nYou'll see my Dell logo flag By and\nthen after the Dell logo, that's the BIOS.\n\n1107\n00:55:57,165 --> 00:55:58,465\nDag gummit, I missed it.\n\n1108\n00:55:58,465 --> 00:56:00,035\nSee this is the real challenge,\n\n1109\n00:56:00,035 --> 00:56:05,565\nis trying to catch it in time\nbefore the system boots.\n\n1110\n00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:09,930\nSo now I'm gonna tick off my system and\ndo a hard oh, well shoot.\n\n1111\n00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,150\n>> Looks nice.\n\n1112\n00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:11,850\n>> Let's try this again.\n\n1113\n00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:13,700\nHere we go.\n\n1114\n00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,170\nSo I'm gonna try and hit F8.\n\n1115\n00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,390\nNow, the thing is when you hit F8,\n\n1116\n00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:20,650\nyou'll get a menu eventually assuming\nyou can not screw it up like I'm doing.\n\n1117\n00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:24,800\nAnd when it comes back up, one of the menu\noptions will be last known good, and\n\n1118\n00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:29,170\nwhat happens is basically,\nevery time you login to your computer,\n\n1119\n00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,609\nwhen you log in it basically.\n\n1120\n00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:36,000\n[LAUGH] So\nhere I am tapping F12 instead of F8.\n\n1121\n00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,250\nThat was effective.\n\n1122\n00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,690\nThird time's the charm.\n\n1123\n00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,610\nSo basically, when you log in.\n\n1124\n00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,960\nHm, I did not get it.\n\n1125\n00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,190\nWhen you log into Windows though.\n\n1126\n00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,890\nWhen you get to that user name and\npassword screen and\n\n1127\n00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,930\nyou punch in that password and you log in.\n\n1128\n00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,480\nThe system will say, hey, you know what,\n\n1129\n00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,540\nthe system is stable enough that\nthe person was able to log in.\n\n1130\n00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:02,620\nAnd so it lets you in.\n\n1131\n00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,200\nIt also makes a little\nbackup of your registry.\n\n1132\n00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,450\nWhich, apparently, I'm just not going\nto be able to get this F8 menu.\n\n1133\n00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,690\nAnd, oh wait, I'm UEFI and\nUEFI disables that.\n\n1134\n00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:14,190\nDoesn't it?\n\n1135\n00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:15,860\nOh, shoot.\n\n1136\n00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,350\nSo we have to go the other way.\n\n1137\n00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,550\nDag gummit, can't show the normal F8 menu.\n\n1138\n00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:23,490\nBut one of the menu options\nthat'll appear is this last known\n\n1139\n00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:26,470\ngood menu that we are talking about.\n\n1140\n00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:31,650\nAnd basically\n\n1141\n00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:35,410\nit let's you choose to boot\nup off of that old copy.\n\n1142\n00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,390\nThat old copy of the registry that\n\n1143\n00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,150\nwas good enough to let you\nlog in a few moments ago.\n\n1144\n00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:44,190\nSo I'll go in the long way\nlike Nate was showing.\n\n1145\n00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,210\nSo I'm gonna go back into\nmy Change PC settings.\n\n1146\n00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,420\nI should have just done it\nyour way Nate but I didn't.\n\n1147\n00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,550\n>> That's okay.\n\n1148\n00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:56,580\n>> So I'm gonna go under General and then\nway down here we'll go under Restart and\n\n1149\n00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,190\nwe'll boot back up into that other mode.\n\n1150\n00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,260\nSo basically you're just telling it, hey,\nwhen you boot up instead of booting up off\n\n1151\n00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,460\nof the newest latest registry,\nboot up off of your backup.\n\n1152\n00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,280\nThe backup of your registry that\nyou knew was good from before.\n\n1153\n00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,880\nSo I'm just gonna go into Troubleshoot.\n\n1154\n00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,080\nAnd we'll go to Advanced.\n\n1155\n00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,371\nAnd we'll go to Startup Settings.\n\n1156\n00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:24,156\nAnd we should see it in here somewhere.\n\n1157\n00:58:24,156 --> 00:58:31,055\nYeah, if you You have a traditional BIOS\nsystem and not a UEFI, then you hit F8 and\n\n1158\n00:58:31,055 --> 00:58:35,795\nit brings you to a text menu that looks\nlike this, but isn't exactly the same.\n\n1159\n00:58:35,795 --> 00:58:38,055\nAnd when you come in here,\nyou'll see your various options.\n\n1160\n00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:41,215\nI've got Safe Mode and\nDebugging, Boot logging.\n\n1161\n00:58:41,215 --> 00:58:45,800\nAnd I actually don't see my\nlast known good in there.\n\n1162\n00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,300\nDo you Nate?\n\n1163\n00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:51,380\n>> No, typically,\nthat is the menu in those options.\n\n1164\n00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:54,080\nKind of like it's buddy's in there.\n\n1165\n00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,860\n>> I'll go into the recovery\noptions here and see.\n\n1166\n00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:01,070\nSo it is a way to quickly revert back.\n\n1167\n00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,660\nSee this is one of those things that was\neasier in Windows Seven because you just\n\n1168\n00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,300\nhit F8 and you got the menu and\nyou were done.\n\n1169\n00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,010\nBut in Windows Eight they had\nto move everything around and\n\n1170\n00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,330\nmake it touch friendly.\n\n1171\n00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:14,200\nSo let's go in here to trouble shoot and\nsee, I don't want to reset my PC.\n\n1172\n00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:19,839\nWe'll talk about reset and refresh\nafter the break, but yeah, we've got,\n\n1173\n00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:25,670\nI don't want to do start up repair, and\nit's not giving me the last known good.\n\n1174\n00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,930\nAll right, well, I'll have to see.\n\n1175\n00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,430\n>> For the fun of it, I guess,\nsince we're gonna redo it,\n\n1176\n00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,022\nlet's just do an automatic repair.\n\n1177\n00:59:32,022 --> 00:59:33,930\nI mean it might flash something.\n\n1178\n00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:38,450\n>> Well, now it's just gonna do the,\nyeah, it's gonna do the full one.\n\n1179\n00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,770\nAlright, well, you know what,\nI'll check during the break and\n\n1180\n00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,360\nsee if there's a way to get\ninto it with a UEFI BIOS,\n\n1181\n00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,070\nI didn't think that was gonna be an issue\non my laptop, but apparently it is.\n\n1182\n00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:50,230\nIf I hadn't rebooted our virtual machine\nI was using then we'd use that one and\n\n1183\n00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,470\nit would come up just fine.\n\n1184\n00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:54,790\nBut since I rebooted the wrong\nmachine that kinda derailed it.\n\n1185\n00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,110\nBut, yeah so\nI'll find that during the break and\n\n1186\n00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,800\nwe'll show it in the next segment.\n\n1187\n00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,710\nAll right, so just keep in mind with\nthe last known good menu it does let you\n\n1188\n01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:05,100\nkinda rollback just the registry and\nnot everything else.\n\n1189\n01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,908\nIt's perfect for driver issues, so on the\nexam if you get a question asking about\n\n1190\n01:00:08,908 --> 01:00:12,716\nlike when you would use that last known\ngood menu, it's when you need to roll back\n\n1191\n01:00:12,716 --> 01:00:16,200\na driver, but like Nate said,\nmaybe you can't get into Windows to do it.\n\n1192\n01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,999\nYou can't log into Windows, so\nhow are you supposed to do it,\n\n1193\n01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:23,080\nthe last known good menu\nis what's there for you.\n\n1194\n01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,370\nAll right.\n\n1195\n01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:29,490\nSo my disastrous menu attempt there has\nrun us out of time on this segment.\n\n1196\n01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:32,490\nLet's stop here and take a break, I'll see\nif there's a way I can force it in during\n\n1197\n01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:33,540\nthe break\n>> I'm sure there is.\n\n1198\n01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,670\n>> And\nthen when we get back we'll see that.\n\n1199\n01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:38,880\nSo, stay tuned for more last known good.\n\n1200\n01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,348\nMenu options after the break.\n\n1201\n01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:44,223\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1202\n01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:49,910\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1203\n01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,250\n>> Woo.\n\n1204\n01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,040\n>> We're energized.\n\n1205\n01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,190\nTook a little lunch break,\nget the juices flowing in.\n\n1206\n01:00:55,190 --> 01:01:01,760\nSo, we left off with the amazing inability\nto get into the F8 menu of Windows 8.1.\n\n1207\n01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,670\nTurns out that while the last\nknown good menu is still there and\n\n1208\n01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,420\nstill part of our exam objectives,\nit's actually disabled by default.\n\n1209\n01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,580\nI did not realize that,\n\n1210\n01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,060\nso I'm not sure if that's something\nthey introduced the Windows 8.1.\n\n1211\n01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:15,840\nOr if it was there in Eight,\n\n1212\n01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,650\nI could have swore in Eight\nyou could get right into it.\n\n1213\n01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,640\nBut, so Nate and\nI did a little Googling and sure enough,\n\n1214\n01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,820\nit turns out it's disabled, so I [LAUGH],\n\n1215\n01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:27,312\nI found a blog posting which is\nappropriately named, I know better.\n\n1216\n01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:27,930\nAnd [LAUGH] and\n\n1217\n01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:33,680\non there they show actually a registry\nkey setting you have to change and\n\n1218\n01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:39,070\na little boot command you've got to issue\nto re-enable the last known good menu.\n\n1219\n01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:43,520\nSo, it is still there,\nit's just not enabled by default.\n\n1220\n01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,480\nAnd the reason is we have another solution\nthat we can use which we're going to\n\n1221\n01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,800\ntalk about in a minute.\n\n1222\n01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,120\nBut for this one,\nbecause it is still on the exam objective,\n\n1223\n01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,750\nI wanted to show it to you guys.\n\n1224\n01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,750\nOnce you've set this registry key,\nyou can reboot and\n\n1225\n01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:00,950\nyou can press F8 while you're booting up,\nand you will get this screen right here.\n\n1226\n01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,580\nThis is what I was trying to\nget right before the break.\n\n1227\n01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:07,160\nAnd you'll notice that most\nof these are menu items\n\n1228\n01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,200\nright out of that screen\nthat Nate had us go to,\n\n1229\n01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:15,050\nexcept on that one it was a touch screen,\nright, this one you can't touch.\n\n1230\n01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:21,340\nSo the new one's a nicer screen, but\nit's missing this one option right here.\n\n1231\n01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,360\nThe Last Known Good Configuration.\n\n1232\n01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,470\nThat menu item right there\nis the one that says, hey,\n\n1233\n01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:32,040\nwhen I boot up, instead of booting up\nwith the current copy of the registry.\n\n1234\n01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,990\nCan we go back to the last one where\nI was actually able to login with\n\n1235\n01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,080\nmy user account?\n\n1236\n01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:37,658\nAll right.\n\n1237\n01:02:37,658 --> 01:02:40,780\nAnd so, that'll rollback things\nlike replaced drivers and\n\n1238\n01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:43,130\nother system changes that might\nhave occurred in the registry, and\n\n1239\n01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,740\noften times be enough to get you through.\n\n1240\n01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:52,100\nNow, the problem here is if you haven't\nenabled the F8 menu ahead of time,\n\n1241\n01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,900\nthere's no way to get into the registry\nand fix it if you've hosed your computer.\n\n1242\n01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,540\nSo it's not such a viable option for\n\n1243\n01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:02,430\nus anymore unless you take the time\nto enable it ahead of time.\n\n1244\n01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:06,410\nSo we've got a couple other solutions\nthat kind of take the place of this.\n\n1245\n01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:07,160\nBut this is how we get to it.\n\n1246\n01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,186\nAnd when you choose that last known good,\nall it's doing is saying hey,\n\n1247\n01:03:11,186 --> 01:03:15,160\nwhen you boot this machine, boot up\noff of that backup of the registry.\n\n1248\n01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,031\nAnd so that's what this\nmachine is doing right now,\n\n1249\n01:03:17,031 --> 01:03:18,640\nis flipping right to the backup.\n\n1250\n01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,390\n>> Now Don, isn't, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n1251\n01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:25,530\nlike last known good,\nlike the Windows automatic repair.\n\n1252\n01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:28,016\nIsn't that just kind of rolled\nup into that as well and\n\n1253\n01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:29,742\nsome of the automatic repair stuff.\n\n1254\n01:03:29,742 --> 01:03:33,977\nAnd when I had tried to\npurposefully break Windows 8 for\n\n1255\n01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:38,494\njust the purpose of trying to\ndemonstrate certain things.\n\n1256\n01:03:38,494 --> 01:03:41,403\nWindows was kicking automatic repair and\nfixed itself.\n\n1257\n01:03:41,403 --> 01:03:44,956\nNine times out of ten, and\nit just bulldozes right through.\n\n1258\n01:03:44,956 --> 01:03:49,551\nSo, perhaps it could be turned off\nbecause Windows 8 is such a great\n\n1259\n01:03:49,551 --> 01:03:51,290\noperating system.\n\n1260\n01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,770\n>> Well, if any of you guys watch\nthe A+ Show, you'll notice that in\n\n1261\n01:03:54,770 --> 01:04:00,150\nthe troubleshooting segments of that show,\nwe almost always use Windows XP.\n\n1262\n01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:03,740\nAnd the reason was that in Windows 7 and\nWindows 8, they made so\n\n1263\n01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,980\nmany things automatically fix themselves.\n\n1264\n01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:09,440\nAnd in Windows 8, if you failed\nto boot up, if you blue screen or\n\n1265\n01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,975\nsomething like that and you reboot,\nit will start what's called an ASR,\n\n1266\n01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:17,859\nan automated system repair or automatic\nstartup repair, you kinda see both.\n\n1267\n01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:23,980\nSo it'll fire up, I think in Windows 7 it\nwas automatic system repair and in Windows\n\n1268\n01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,770\n8, it's automatic startup repair,\nbut either way it's the same thing.\n\n1269\n01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:29,980\nWhen the system boots up, it'll actually\nrun through some little repairs where\n\n1270\n01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:33,315\nit'll fix any missing BOOT files, and\nit'll try and roll back the registry,\n\n1271\n01:04:33,315 --> 01:04:37,115\nit'll try and do the last known good, but\nthe other thing is, you can always restore\n\n1272\n01:04:37,115 --> 01:04:41,285\nto a system restore point, and that'll\nroll that registry back also, all right?\n\n1273\n01:04:41,285 --> 01:04:44,690\nSo my little machine here, it's already\nfinished booting very quick and\n\n1274\n01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,550\nthat's because the registry's\nbeing stored twice.\n\n1275\n01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,390\nSo all it has to do is point to\nthe new keys and it's in business.\n\n1276\n01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,111\nSo it's a pretty neat system,\nit's pretty cool.\n\n1277\n01:04:53,111 --> 01:04:59,725\n>> Yeah, now, apart from last know good,\nsome of our other system configuration.\n\n1278\n01:04:59,725 --> 01:05:02,685\nI just thought of something,\nlike when you have a problem on\n\n1279\n01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:05,610\nyour computer like the network\ntroubleshooter, right?\n\n1280\n01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,570\n>> The pointless and useless-\n>> This kind of runs through, and\n\n1281\n01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:14,670\nyou see a little green bar, and me\npersonally it hardly ever fixes anything.\n\n1282\n01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:19,345\nBut yeah, the startup repair,\nI mean, that's a real good one.\n\n1283\n01:05:19,345 --> 01:05:20,825\nIt fixes it a lot of the times.\n\n1284\n01:05:20,825 --> 01:05:23,985\n>> We would try and build these broken\nmachines for our troubleshooting segments\n\n1285\n01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:26,685\nso that we could show that process\non the A+ Show, and we'd do\n\n1286\n01:05:26,685 --> 01:05:30,845\nthings like damage the BOOT file or\nbreak the BOOT records, stuff like that.\n\n1287\n01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:32,745\nAnd you'd reboot Windows and\nit would fix itself.\n\n1288\n01:05:32,745 --> 01:05:34,485\nAnd you're like come on, so\n\n1289\n01:05:34,485 --> 01:05:37,185\nwe'd say let's just use Windows XP\nbecause it doesn't fix anything.\n\n1290\n01:05:38,285 --> 01:05:40,130\n[LAUGH] And so that would get us by.\n\n1291\n01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:45,412\n>> Now moving on, or not moving on but\nI guess, taking it one step further,\n\n1292\n01:05:45,412 --> 01:05:50,780\nif last known good cannot revive\nthe computer, there is another step, or\n\n1293\n01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:56,690\ntwo other steps to I guess, to repair the\ncomputer and get things back and going.\n\n1294\n01:05:56,690 --> 01:06:02,910\nAnd this is the refresh and reset.\n\n1295\n01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:03,750\n>> Refresh and reset.\n\n1296\n01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,710\nIf you've ever bought a laptop\nthat was like an HP, or a Dell,\n\n1297\n01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,700\nor a Lenovo, they often ship with\na recovery partition on them.\n\n1298\n01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,843\nAnd what that is is a part of\nthe hard drive that's segmented off,\n\n1299\n01:06:15,843 --> 01:06:19,730\nthat has a fresh image of what your laptop\nlooked like when you first bought it, or\n\n1300\n01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,070\nyour desktop.\n\n1301\n01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,170\nAnd so\nif things ever get totally hosed up and\n\n1302\n01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,570\nyou're on the phone with tech support,\nthe HP tech or Dell tech or\n\n1303\n01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,760\nwhoever will oftentimes say,\nall right well you know what?\n\n1304\n01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,290\nLet's boot into our recovery menu and roll\nyour system back to factory settings, and\n\n1305\n01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:35,600\nthat wipes it out, puts it back to the way\nit was, and everything's happy, right?\n\n1306\n01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,760\nWell it was up to the vendors to do that.\n\n1307\n01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,260\nSo some vendors did and\nsome vendors didn't.\n\n1308\n01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,320\nAnd it ate up hard drive space, so\na lot of people didn't like that and\n\n1309\n01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,670\nthey would delete the partitions.\n\n1310\n01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,242\nLike this guy.\n\n1311\n01:06:46,242 --> 01:06:47,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n1312\n01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,839\nthen it wasn't a very useful feature.\n\n1313\n01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:52,270\nIn Windows 8 we have that\nfunctionality built in.\n\n1314\n01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:56,110\nWindows 8 makes a protected\ncopy of the operating system.\n\n1315\n01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:57,226\nIt's just actually stored\non the hard drive.\n\n1316\n01:06:57,226 --> 01:07:04,006\nIt can't be written to, and so at\nanytime you can do a refresh or a reset.\n\n1317\n01:07:04,006 --> 01:07:05,460\nNow what's the difference?\n\n1318\n01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:10,290\nWell, a refresh will\nrecopy all of the Windows\n\n1319\n01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:15,400\noperating system files from this protected\narea, back into your main system area.\n\n1320\n01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:20,080\nSo if any Windows files have become\ndamaged or corrupted, it'll fix those.\n\n1321\n01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,810\nSo if it's a problem with Windows,\nit'll fix it in a refresh, all right?\n\n1322\n01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:28,800\nBut if it's a problem with\nMicrosoft Office or Google Chrome or\n\n1323\n01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,930\nwhatever other applications you run.\n\n1324\n01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,170\na refresh won't fix it.\n\n1325\n01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,761\nYou're refreshing the Windows files,\nnot your applications.\n\n1326\n01:07:34,761 --> 01:07:38,673\nBut if it's just a single application, you\ncan uninstall and reinstall, or whatever,\n\n1327\n01:07:38,673 --> 01:07:40,520\nprobably fix the problem there, right?\n\n1328\n01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:46,260\n>> Now a refresh, it will wipe\nout your modern style apps but\n\n1329\n01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,800\nit'll leave desktop apps.\n\n1330\n01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,550\n>> Good point.\n\n1331\n01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:51,068\nI always forget about those.\n\n1332\n01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:55,489\nI mean, the Windows app market [CROSSTALK]\n>> It's the first thing you see when\n\n1333\n01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:56,320\nyou turn it on.\n\n1334\n01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,395\n>> So the three apps in the app store.\n\n1335\n01:07:58,395 --> 01:07:59,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you managed [LAUGH] I shouldn't say\n\n1336\n01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,710\nthat cuz there's thousands of them.\n\n1337\n01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:05,788\nBut yeah, so if you did those, but It's\nreally easy, because you just go back into\n\n1338\n01:08:05,788 --> 01:08:09,711\nthe store, you go to my apps and you say\ndownload all, and it puts them all back.\n\n1339\n01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:12,730\nBut yeah, I do forget about that\ncuz I just don't use the store.\n\n1340\n01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,000\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1341\n01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,880\nSo, personal documents, desktop apps like\nOffice and whatever else you put on there,\n\n1342\n01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,770\nthose will remain system files though,\nthat will all be reverted and\n\n1343\n01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:29,240\nyou're monitoring style apps will\nbe reverted to it's factory state.\n\n1344\n01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,130\n>> Now that's the refresh.\n\n1345\n01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,550\nThe alternative is the reset.\n\n1346\n01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:39,570\nAnd with the reset, what it does is it\nwipes everything and it puts a fresh and\n\n1347\n01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:44,800\nclean copy of Windows 8 back on there,\nbut you lose all of your applications.\n\n1348\n01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,060\nAnything that you've installed,\nMicrosoft Office, Google Chrome,\n\n1349\n01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,630\nwhatever, gone, right?\n\n1350\n01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:52,980\nSo it is a reset, putting you back\nto a factory install of Windows.\n\n1351\n01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,690\nThis is a worst case\nscenario type solution.\n\n1352\n01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:59,600\nIf things are just so\nmessed up that you can't function, and\n\n1353\n01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,010\nyou just need to get a working PC as fast\nas possible, a reset will give you that.\n\n1354\n01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:07,840\nIt'll put things back as if you\ndid a fresh install of Windows 8.\n\n1355\n01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:12,610\n>> Yeah, and just as a fresh install,\n\n1356\n01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:17,380\nI've run through a reset on my PC before.\n\n1357\n01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:20,955\nAnd it does feel like it takes\njust as long to do a reset than it\n\n1358\n01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:23,896\ndoes actually doing a fresh\ninstall of Windows.\n\n1359\n01:09:23,896 --> 01:09:28,093\nIt just sits there and it grinds and\ngrinds away and in the background,\n\n1360\n01:09:28,093 --> 01:09:32,437\nI'm sure that's exactly what it is doing,\njust reinstalling that OS so\n\n1361\n01:09:32,437 --> 01:09:34,518\nthe personal documents are gone.\n\n1362\n01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:36,490\nYeah, everything back to a clean state.\n\n1363\n01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,390\n>> So, how do we do those?\n\n1364\n01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:43,860\nWell, we actually crossed the menu\nearlier, but it's really not so hard.\n\n1365\n01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:48,010\nBasically, on your machine,\nif you pull up your charms bar, and\n\n1366\n01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:50,120\nthen my head is probably\ngonna be on top of it.\n\n1367\n01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:54,160\nBut, in the charms bar, you go to the\nsettings button down at the bottom, and\n\n1368\n01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,270\nin our settings.\n\n1369\n01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:58,560\nLet me resize this so\nthat my head's not on top of it.\n\n1370\n01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,880\nSo basically, you bring up your charms\nbar and you go to settings, and\n\n1371\n01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,720\nthen down at the bottom you'll see this\nlink here that says Change PC Settings.\n\n1372\n01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,940\nAnd you can go in there and that's\ngonna take us into this bigger screen.\n\n1373\n01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,619\nSo I can go back to full screen now.\n\n1374\n01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:13,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stop telling me about these shortcuts,\n\n1375\n01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,640\nI understand.\n\n1376\n01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,000\nThere we go.\n\n1377\n01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,947\nAnd so once you're in here in the PC\nsettings, you can go into, oh shoot\n\n1378\n01:10:21,947 --> 01:10:26,850\ndid I click away, I wanted to go to-\n>> No 8.1 is slightly different.\n\n1379\n01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,440\nSo you'll have an update in recovery.\n\n1380\n01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,861\n>> Down here at the bottom.\n\n1381\n01:10:29,861 --> 01:10:32,904\nIn Windows 8,\nthere's a general option, right?\n\n1382\n01:10:32,904 --> 01:10:35,560\nIt's general isn't it?\n\n1383\n01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,640\nAnd then in 8.1 it's now update and\nrecovery.\n\n1384\n01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,840\n>> Correct.\n>> Nate's pulling up his and\n\n1385\n01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,470\nyeah, it's general.\n\n1386\n01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,570\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna go to update and recovery.\n\n1387\n01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,640\nLet me show that real quick.\n\n1388\n01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:49,300\nSo here we've got this update in Recovery\nmenu and I can go to Recovery and\n\n1389\n01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,180\nhere's where we start to see\nthe options to do refresh.\n\n1390\n01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:56,830\nHere's reset where they say remove\neverything and reinstall Windows, and\n\n1391\n01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:57,610\nhere's Advanced startup.\n\n1392\n01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:01,360\nLet me show you that on 8 though,\nso here's my machine,\n\n1393\n01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,230\nand I'm gonna go into the same thing.\n\n1394\n01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:08,140\nI'm going in to change PC settings and\nsee how I've got General over here?\n\n1395\n01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,085\nAnd you can see where that's misleading,\nlike General!\n\n1396\n01:11:10,085 --> 01:11:11,400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, great you know,\n\n1397\n01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,560\nwhat does that mean?\n\n1398\n01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,104\nAnd if you scroll all the way to\nthe bottom that's where we get this remove\n\n1399\n01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:20,350\neverything and reinstall Windows, Refresh\nyour PC without affecting your files, so\n\n1400\n01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,882\nthere's those same options.\n\n1401\n01:11:21,882 --> 01:11:24,064\nThe menu changed between 8 and 8.1.\n\n1402\n01:11:24,064 --> 01:11:28,930\nNow, if you're taking the 70-687 exam,\n\n1403\n01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:33,395\ntoday it is built on Windows 8, okay?\n\n1404\n01:11:33,395 --> 01:11:36,223\nBut if you're watching this\nvideo in the future, right?\n\n1405\n01:11:36,223 --> 01:11:41,248\nProjecting our knowledge in the future,\nthe 7687 exam will get updated to 8.1 and\n\n1406\n01:11:41,248 --> 01:11:44,131\nso we'll need to remember\nthe new menu locations.\n\n1407\n01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:45,904\nSo definitely keep that in mind.\n\n1408\n01:11:45,904 --> 01:11:48,160\nAs you study.\n\n1409\n01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,537\nAll right, so either way,\nonce you get past where the buttons are,\n\n1410\n01:11:51,537 --> 01:11:52,910\nthe rest of it's the same.\n\n1411\n01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:57,880\nSo let me go back into my virtual\nmachine because I don't want to reset or\n\n1412\n01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,070\nrefresh my actual laptop.\n\n1413\n01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:01,920\nNot today at least.\n\n1414\n01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,720\nOkay, so when I go in here, really I'm\njust picking what do I want to do?\n\n1415\n01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:10,550\nDo I want to wipe out the whole system and\njust put it back to a stock install?\n\n1416\n01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:13,650\nOr do I want to go ahead and\njust refresh so\n\n1417\n01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:19,010\nthat I can just fix a Windows problem,\nwhatever, and I don't lose my data?\n\n1418\n01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:22,870\nSo of course,\nI'm gonna do remove everything.\n\n1419\n01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:25,065\nNo, I'm not really gonna do either.\n\n1420\n01:12:25,065 --> 01:12:28,045\n[LAUGH] I guess we could go ahead and\ndo it.\n\n1421\n01:12:28,045 --> 01:12:29,800\nIt's a virtual machine, so what do I care?\n\n1422\n01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,380\nSo I'm gonna tell it to remove\neverything and reinstall Windows.\n\n1423\n01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:34,510\nRight?\nScrew it, let's do the whole thing.\n\n1424\n01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:36,420\nSo it's gonna jump in there and\nknock that out.\n\n1425\n01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,710\nNow, like Nate said,\nit takes a little while.\n\n1426\n01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:40,385\nIt's basically reinstalling Windows.\n\n1427\n01:12:40,385 --> 01:12:42,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1428\n01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,270\n>> So we don't have to sit here and\nwatch it.\n\n1429\n01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:45,310\nIt's actually really boring.\n\n1430\n01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,310\nIt's gonna say Please wait,\nit's preparing.\n\n1431\n01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:49,520\nHere it's starting to\ncopy some files around.\n\n1432\n01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,160\nAnd then it's gonna reboot and run through\nmost of the full process after that.\n\n1433\n01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,678\nOnce it reboots it does that.\n\n1434\n01:12:55,678 --> 01:12:59,190\nIt takes longer than an install.\n\n1435\n01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,130\nReally it's like 30 or 45 minutes.\n\n1436\n01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:04,190\nAnd then it'll finish and off it goes.\n\n1437\n01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:09,360\nSo, here it's just warning me, all my\npersonal files and apps will be removed.\n\n1438\n01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,890\nMy PC settings will be changed back\nto their defaults and I can hit Next.\n\n1439\n01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,490\nAnd it's gonna say where do I want\nto remove all the files from.\n\n1440\n01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:19,950\nI can pick all drives or\njust my operating system drive,\n\n1441\n01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,950\ndepends on how drastic I want to be.\n\n1442\n01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,182\nI'll just say the operating system.\n\n1443\n01:13:23,182 --> 01:13:29,240\nAll right, and then we can do just remove\nmy files or we can fully clean it.\n\n1444\n01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,270\nNow, notice this.\n\n1445\n01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:34,310\nUse this if you'll recycle the PC,\nif you're gonna give it to somebody else.\n\n1446\n01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:36,140\nThis can take several hours.\n\n1447\n01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:39,150\nIt's actually going to try and\ndo multiple writes to the hard drive so\n\n1448\n01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:41,050\nthat your data can't be recovered, right?\n\n1449\n01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:41,950\nSo if you are giving it away,\n\n1450\n01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,570\nyou don't want people to get\nyour sensitive information.\n\n1451\n01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:45,900\nI'll say just remove my files.\n\n1452\n01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:49,348\nI'm keeping the PC, so\nI don't think anybody's gonna try and\n\n1453\n01:13:49,348 --> 01:13:50,659\nsalvage data off of it.\n\n1454\n01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:51,739\nAnd I'll hit Reset.\n\n1455\n01:13:54,003 --> 01:13:55,980\nAnd off it'll go, it's thinking.\n\n1456\n01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,550\nSo anyhow,\nit is a pretty intensive process.\n\n1457\n01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,250\nIt is gonna take a while to run.\n\n1458\n01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,480\nAnd there it goes.\n\n1459\n01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,680\nSo I'll show you guys it starting, once\nit gets into its starting process, but\n\n1460\n01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,100\nwe won't sit here and\nwatch the whole thing.\n\n1461\n01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:10,030\nIt's actually pretty boring.\n\n1462\n01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:14,810\n>> Yeah, this would be a great time\nif they threw in the ASCII Star Wars\n\n1463\n01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:17,105\nbecause that would be something\nto watch while it does its thing.\n\n1464\n01:14:17,105 --> 01:14:18,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not ASCII, yeah, no.\n\n1465\n01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:20,690\n>> Yeah, it was ASCII, via telnet.\n\n1466\n01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:24,260\nIf you guys watched the security\nplus episode the other day,\n\n1467\n01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:29,450\nwe were showing telnet and I went to\na website that had the whole movie\n\n1468\n01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:33,730\nStar Wars rendered in text,\nwhich is pretty entertaining.\n\n1469\n01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,430\nBut yeah, they should make\nlike a Freecell available or\n\n1470\n01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,520\nsomething while it's doing this.\n\n1471\n01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,337\nI don't think it would be too hard.\n\n1472\n01:14:41,337 --> 01:14:43,240\n>> Mm-mm.\n>> But here it's rebooting and\n\n1473\n01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,420\nwhen it boots up, it's gonna look like\nit's booting into Windows 8 or whatever,\n\n1474\n01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,810\nbut it's gonna go into a recovery\nscreen pretty quickly.\n\n1475\n01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:53,060\nSo I see my little Windows 8\ncircle spinning down here.\n\n1476\n01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,450\nI'm running it on top of a Hyper-V system,\nso it says that, but\n\n1477\n01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,200\nnormally you'd see\nthe Windows logo right there.\n\n1478\n01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:00,760\nAnd then it's gonna\nfire into its recovery.\n\n1479\n01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:07,210\nNow, oftentimes we don't need\nto do a full recovery like this.\n\n1480\n01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,880\nUsually there's just one little problem,\neither a bad driver or\n\n1481\n01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,540\nsome kind of startup application\nthat's causing our issue.\n\n1482\n01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,470\nSo let's take a look at how we can fix\nthose without doing a full-on wipe\n\n1483\n01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:18,200\nof our system.\n\n1484\n01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,570\n>> So yeah, and\nthis is the driver rollback.\n\n1485\n01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:24,170\nIs that where we're going on with this?\n\n1486\n01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:24,880\n>> Yes.\n\n1487\n01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,180\n>> All right, just making sure.\n\n1488\n01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:31,140\n>> And startup options, but\nwe'll do driver rollback first.\n\n1489\n01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,560\n>> Yeah, driver options.\n\n1490\n01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:38,470\nRolling back a driver, let's say you're\nstill able to get into Windows, so\n\n1491\n01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:39,340\nit's not a critical driver.\n\n1492\n01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:42,670\nWe'll say a webcam driver perhaps.\n\n1493\n01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:48,150\nAnd yeah, great little utility,\nComputer Management.\n\n1494\n01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:50,923\nRight, we get in there and\ndo the Device Manager, and\n\n1495\n01:15:50,923 --> 01:15:56,290\nit's just as simple as right-clicking on\nProperties, rolling back, and that's it.\n\n1496\n01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,880\n>> Let me give you guys\na great example of this.\n\n1497\n01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:03,310\nMy laptop, I've got an Intel HD\n4000 video card in my laptop.\n\n1498\n01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:07,300\nAnd the HD 4000 is a decent card,\nit's not the greatest card in the world.\n\n1499\n01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,580\nAnd I got the drivers from Dell,\nand they work well enough.\n\n1500\n01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,430\nBut I said, you know what?\n\n1501\n01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,520\nI'm gonna go get the one\nstraight from Intel.\n\n1502\n01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,650\nI want the Intel drivers,\nnot the Dell Intel drivers.\n\n1503\n01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,950\nSo I went to Intel and\nI went to do the install and it said, hey,\n\n1504\n01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,530\nthis system is supported by a vendor.\n\n1505\n01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:23,120\nYou need to go to Dell's site to get it.\n\n1506\n01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,390\nI said well, forget that.\n\n1507\n01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:28,430\nSo I manually edited the driver\nto remove that restriction and\n\n1508\n01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,155\nI forced it on my laptop.\n\n1509\n01:16:30,155 --> 01:16:33,315\nWell, once that happened,\nmy video card freaked out and\n\n1510\n01:16:33,315 --> 01:16:35,405\nI couldn't get a resolution\nhigher than 800 by 600, right?\n\n1511\n01:16:35,405 --> 01:16:40,275\nSo I was still in Windows, but\n\n1512\n01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:44,577\nmy driver was broken, so\nI used driver rollback to fix that.\n\n1513\n01:16:44,577 --> 01:16:49,007\nAnd so what I did is little Windows\nkey-x in Computer Management.\n\n1514\n01:16:50,337 --> 01:16:52,597\nActually I could have saved time and\ngone right to the Device Manager, but\n\n1515\n01:16:52,597 --> 01:16:53,667\nI usually go this way.\n\n1516\n01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:55,990\nSo I'll go to the Device Manager here.\n\n1517\n01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:59,680\nAnd I went in and I pulled up my\ndisplay adapters, and there was\n\n1518\n01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:06,578\nthe Intel HD Graphics 4000, and I had this\nforced Intel driver on there at the time.\n\n1519\n01:17:06,578 --> 01:17:09,230\nWhen you right-click on it, you'll see\nsome of the different options that you\n\n1520\n01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,490\ngot, and I just went into Properties.\n\n1521\n01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:17,220\nAnd under the Driver tab,\nif you've updated the driver,\n\n1522\n01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:20,110\nit maintains a copy of\nthe previous driver.\n\n1523\n01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:24,230\nAnd I was able to just hit Roll Back and\nit rolled it back to the Dell driver and\n\n1524\n01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:26,700\nthen my display was\nworking properly again.\n\n1525\n01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,360\nReally convenient if you\ncan get into Windows.\n\n1526\n01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,700\nAnd this works in safe mode also.\n\n1527\n01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,510\nSo if you reboot into safe mode, right,\n\n1528\n01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:38,030\nif you can at least get into safe mode,\nthen you can use this rollback.\n\n1529\n01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,280\nIf you can't even get into safe mode,\n\n1530\n01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,852\nthat's when you try your last known\ngood menu, or you try a system restore.\n\n1531\n01:17:43,852 --> 01:17:47,890\n>> Yeah, roll back driver.\n\n1532\n01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:53,120\n>> Yeah, and that feature's been there\nsince Windows XP, maybe even Windows 2000.\n\n1533\n01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,180\nI know it was in Windows XP, so\nit's been around for at least ten years.\n\n1534\n01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,725\nThat one's been around for awhile.\n\n1535\n01:17:57,725 --> 01:17:59,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1536\n01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,560\n>> All right,\nnow the other thing I wanna point out is\n\n1537\n01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,410\nit may be more than just drivers.\n\n1538\n01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,410\nYou may have a bad\napplication on your system.\n\n1539\n01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:08,950\nMaybe your system's running fine, and then\nyou download some program on the Internet,\n\n1540\n01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,600\nand now that it's installed, when you\nboot up your computer, it blue screens or\n\n1541\n01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,000\ncrashes or causes some problem.\n\n1542\n01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,310\nYour system's running slow or whatever.\n\n1543\n01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:18,295\nSo we have a lot of startup\noptions in Windows.\n\n1544\n01:18:18,295 --> 01:18:20,495\nAnd there's two different\nplaces that we can go.\n\n1545\n01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:23,355\nActually, there's really three different\nplaces we can go to adjust what happens\n\n1546\n01:18:23,355 --> 01:18:25,865\nwhen our machine starts up, all right?\n\n1547\n01:18:25,865 --> 01:18:30,895\nOne of my favorite places to go\nis a utility called msconfig.\n\n1548\n01:18:30,895 --> 01:18:35,460\nSo I'll just bring up my\nWindows start screen and\n\n1549\n01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:39,080\ntype in msconfig, and there it is.\n\n1550\n01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,300\nIt found that utility for me.\n\n1551\n01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,910\nAnd when you go into msconfig,\n\n1552\n01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:47,020\nit's a neat little utility because\nit's got this Startup tab and\n\n1553\n01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:50,590\nit will show you the various\nprograms that run when we start up.\n\n1554\n01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:51,310\nOr it normally would.\n\n1555\n01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,510\nNow it's got a link here\nto the Task Manager, great.\n\n1556\n01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:55,300\nSo the Task Manager's the other place.\n\n1557\n01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,700\nWell I mentioned three places, right?\n\n1558\n01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:01,150\nSo there's msconfig, where we've\ngot our boot options like if I want\n\n1559\n01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:05,340\nto boot into safe mode, if I want to\ndo no GUI boot, things like that.\n\n1560\n01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,690\nAnd the start up part, now that's in\nthe Task Manager, so that's number two.\n\n1561\n01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:12,550\nAnd then number three is in our charms bar\nwe have a setting where we can do some of\n\n1562\n01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:13,150\nthese options too.\n\n1563\n01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,620\nNow let me go ahead and\ngo into the Task Manager.\n\n1564\n01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,100\nIn the Task Manager we\nhave the Startup tab, and\n\n1565\n01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,200\nhere you'll also see\nthe programs that start.\n\n1566\n01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,400\nNow this is kind of neat cuz it\nshows not only applications, but\n\n1567\n01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,050\nit shows a couple of Windows\nfunctions that start also.\n\n1568\n01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:28,830\nSo I'll see some different\nthings here on the list.\n\n1569\n01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,540\nA lot of these are tied to my\nnetwork adapter and stuff.\n\n1570\n01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,078\nSo here's my Intel.\n\n1571\n01:19:33,078 --> 01:19:37,348\nI've got a few others in here,\nmy Intel graphics.\n\n1572\n01:19:37,348 --> 01:19:40,738\nOkay, so\nhere I can see Akamai NetSession Client.\n\n1573\n01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:44,993\nAt some point I downloaded a file\nthat was hosted by Akamai.\n\n1574\n01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:47,900\nAnd Akamai loves you to\nuse their downloadhelper.\n\n1575\n01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,860\nRight?\nSo you can do recover downloads if they\n\n1576\n01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:51,990\nget interrupted and stuff like that.\n\n1577\n01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,030\nThat's great.\n\n1578\n01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:54,360\nBut you know what?\n\n1579\n01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,310\nI needed that when I downloaded\na file a few weeks ago.\n\n1580\n01:19:57,310 --> 01:19:59,590\nI don't download files\nfrom Akamai every day.\n\n1581\n01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:03,940\nBut now that daggum thing is running on\nmy system every time I start my computer.\n\n1582\n01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:07,780\nSo the cool thing is, if you don't\nneed it, you can just choose it and\n\n1583\n01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:12,346\nhit disable, and now when you start the\ncomputer that is not going to start up,\n\n1584\n01:20:12,346 --> 01:20:13,504\nall right?\n\n1585\n01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:17,780\nSo an easy way to enable or\ndisable it and not have it run.\n\n1586\n01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:21,270\nSo I mean, here's,\nit's running twice on my system and\n\n1587\n01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:27,690\nI don't even need it a single time, it's\njust kinda here and not necessary, right?\n\n1588\n01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,030\nSo you can go through and pick and choose.\n\n1589\n01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,680\nIf you've got a trouble application,\n\n1590\n01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,260\nyou can turn it off and\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n1591\n01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:36,890\nI've got the Wondershare Studio,\nI don't even know what the heck that is.\n\n1592\n01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:39,040\nSo I might want to disable that or,\n\n1593\n01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,790\noh, that's that little PDF program I use,\nisn't it?\n\n1594\n01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:45,530\nWell anyhow, there's a couple of\ndifferent things here I need to identify.\n\n1595\n01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:46,520\nNow there's some like Steam.\n\n1596\n01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:50,500\nI gotta have my Steam, right,\nso I can't disable that one.\n\n1597\n01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,094\nBut some of the other things I may or\nmay not need.\n\n1598\n01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:56,260\n>> Yeah, you know there are,\neven to me there's\n\n1599\n01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:00,790\nsome utilities on my machine at\nhome that startup all the time.\n\n1600\n01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:06,520\nWebcam software that starts up, and little\nprograms, and it's just extra, of course.\n\n1601\n01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:11,600\nPCs these days, it doesn't really\nslow down the boot that much.\n\n1602\n01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,780\nBut yeah, it's not really necessary to\nbe running all these little programs,\n\n1603\n01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:20,480\nthese little utilities like\nyour little download manager.\n\n1604\n01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,985\nNo reason, it could potentially\ncause conflicts with other items,\n\n1605\n01:21:25,985 --> 01:21:29,180\ncrash a little bit later, or whatnot.\n\n1606\n01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:31,020\nAnd so yeah, it's right there,\n\n1607\n01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:34,730\nprevent those programs from\nautomatically starting on startup.\n\n1608\n01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:35,230\n>> Yep.\n\n1609\n01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:38,700\nAnd then the last place, the place\nI mentioned under the charms bar,\n\n1610\n01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:44,040\nif I go back onto my system and\nI just kinda swipe in from the right and\n\n1611\n01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:48,900\nI go to Settings and, oh you know\nwhat my heads on top of it again.\n\n1612\n01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:52,030\nJason, can we get my desktop\nfull screen for a second?\n\n1613\n01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,530\nGet my head off that corner.\n\n1614\n01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:54,360\nThere we go.\n\n1615\n01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,620\nSo if I go into my charms bar and\nI go to Settings down here.\n\n1616\n01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,971\nAnd then I go at the very bottom\nto that Change Settings, and\n\n1617\n01:22:00,971 --> 01:22:03,000\nwe go into this screen, all right?\n\n1618\n01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,920\nSo on this screen, you know this is where\nwe kind of went to General earlier and\n\n1619\n01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,710\nat the very bottom we had\nthis Advanced Startup.\n\n1620\n01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:13,760\nAnd that Advanced Startup right there\nhas even more options available for\n\n1621\n01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,060\nus that kind of overlap with the others.\n\n1622\n01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:21,400\nSo we have Refresh and Reset are in there,\nas well as Safe Mode and\n\n1623\n01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,770\na few of the other ones.\n\n1624\n01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,105\nAnd did I just lose my desktop?\n\n1625\n01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,983\nI did, shoot.\n\n1626\n01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:29,630\nSo the laptop actually Reboots\nas a part of it, so I lost it.\n\n1627\n01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:31,210\nBut on that screen,\n\n1628\n01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:34,130\nI showed it earlier in the episode\nwhen were on the virtual machine,\n\n1629\n01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:37,990\non that screens, you'll just see the\noptions to do, Refresh, Reset, and so on.\n\n1630\n01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:41,280\nSo a lot of the stuff that we talk about\nis all condensed in that one spot.\n\n1631\n01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,405\nSo that's pretty convenient.\n\n1632\n01:22:42,405 --> 01:22:43,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1633\n01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,220\nI was a little surprised you\nactually pushed it on your machine,\n\n1634\n01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,390\nand then there it goes.\n\n1635\n01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:50,594\n>> Oh, you were like,\nDon's not dumb enough to do that.\n\n1636\n01:22:50,594 --> 01:22:52,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then I did it.\n\n1637\n01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:55,200\nSo you know we could actually go to.\n\n1638\n01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,200\nJason we set up for sky cam?\n\n1639\n01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:58,730\nHe's like of course.\n\n1640\n01:22:58,730 --> 01:22:59,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Am I doing my job?\n\n1641\n01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:02,770\nMaybe.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n1642\n01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:05,050\nlet me just throw it\nup here on the skycam.\n\n1643\n01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:08,390\nSo we can see the screen where it's\ngot turn off your pc, that's not fun.\n\n1644\n01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:12,340\nBut Troubleshoot, and\nin here, there's Refresh and\n\n1645\n01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:16,290\nReset, and if we go to Advanced,\nSystem Restore,\n\n1646\n01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:21,200\nSystem Image Recovery, Automatic Repair,\nthere's that automatic startup repair.\n\n1647\n01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,880\nCommand Prompt, Firmware Settings and\nStartup Settings.\n\n1648\n01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,130\nAnd when we go in here, here's where we\ncan turn on low resolution video mode,\n\n1649\n01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,200\nSafe Mode, Disable driver signing.\n\n1650\n01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,790\nA lot of the same stuff we saw on\nthat other screen are right here.\n\n1651\n01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,210\nAnd so we did pull this up\nearlier in the episode, and\n\n1652\n01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,640\nkind of got a chance to see it.\n\n1653\n01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:42,900\nAnd boy you realize how filthy your\nmonitor is when the system goes all black,\n\n1654\n01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:44,820\nbut looks nice and clean there.\n\n1655\n01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,970\nSo anyhow we can see all\nthe different options, so\n\n1656\n01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:50,750\nif I'm having a problem with my\nvideo card and I can't get in,\n\n1657\n01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:54,520\nI can choose Enable low resolution video,\nand that'll boot without a video driver.\n\n1658\n01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,520\nThat'll let me get in and fix it.\n\n1659\n01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:01,300\nBut you'll see other things in here\nthat we could tinker with to try and\n\n1660\n01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,040\nfix and adjust our system.\n\n1661\n01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,950\nI might wanna go into Safe Mode.\n\n1662\n01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:07,840\nAnd so I can say Enable Safe Mode,\nwhich apparently I\n\n1663\n01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,380\nneed to press on the keyboard, and so\nnow it's gonna boot up into Safe Mode.\n\n1664\n01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,650\nThis loads with no drivers,\nand so I can go in and\n\n1665\n01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:18,720\nI can fix the driver or fix whatever\nthe issue is and get in there.\n\n1666\n01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:25,870\nMy slightly squished face here thanks to,\nhang on I can't type crooked, there we go.\n\n1667\n01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:30,414\nSo my crooked face here because\nthe laptop screen is 16 by 9, but\n\n1668\n01:24:30,414 --> 01:24:32,460\nin Safe Mode it's not\nloading a video driver.\n\n1669\n01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:35,740\nSo it ends up loading it four by three,\nstretched wide.\n\n1670\n01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:40,030\nSo here I am in Safe Mode, and now I\ncan get in and I can fix my drivers and\n\n1671\n01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:43,130\nother things, hopefully fix them.\n\n1672\n01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:45,040\nOnce I've got it sorted out,\nI can just Reboot.\n\n1673\n01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,530\nAnd when you Reboot,\n\n1674\n01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:51,480\nit'll boot back up into the regular\nfull version of Windows 8.\n\n1675\n01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:55,190\nSo yet another way to get\nat the same basic thing.\n\n1676\n01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,890\nAll right so Nate,\nthat is a pretty good well rounded\n\n1677\n01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:05,300\ncoverage of restoring and\nbacking up our systems.\n\n1678\n01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,810\nCan you think if anything else we need\nto touch on before we wrap the show up?\n\n1679\n01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:14,790\n>> I mean, that is a pretty exhaustive\nlist of where to find things and\n\n1680\n01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:19,360\nwhy you would need to go there, and\nwhat it looks like when we actually do it.\n\n1681\n01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,230\n>> Okay.\n\n1682\n01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:24,840\nWell, let me just remind everybody, if\nyou have any questions about this stuff,\n\n1683\n01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,830\nalways remember live\nduring the show you can\n\n1684\n01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:32,380\ngo to itpro.tv/live right beneath our\nvideo you will see the chat screen.\n\n1685\n01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:34,155\nYou can punch any questions\nyou have in there and\n\n1686\n01:25:34,155 --> 01:25:35,530\nwe'll answer them during the show.\n\n1687\n01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,030\nYou can also jump over to the website,\n\n1688\n01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:41,790\ngo to itpro.tv after the show, and\nyou can go into the episode library.\n\n1689\n01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:45,840\nInside of every certification page,\nthere is a link to the Q and A.\n\n1690\n01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,470\nThe question and answers section.\n\n1691\n01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:48,680\nPost your questions there.\n\n1692\n01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,280\nWe monitor.\n\n1693\n01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,570\nWe get back and answer them.\n\n1694\n01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:54,190\nSo we make sure that anything that's\nkinda left in doubt, we answer.\n\n1695\n01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:56,710\nIf it's a really good question,\nwe'll turn it into an episode.\n\n1696\n01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:59,740\nWe'll actually record something and\nanswer the question.\n\n1697\n01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:02,800\nSo that's where we get a lot of our\ngood material is that stuff from our\n\n1698\n01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:03,690\nviewers, like you.\n\n1699\n01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:06,435\nSo, this service paid for\nby viewers like you.\n\n1700\n01:26:06,435 --> 01:26:07,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1701\n01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:12,120\njust keep that in mind,\nthat pretty much wraps up objective seven.\n\n1702\n01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:14,890\nWe still have a couple more windows\neight shows before we've rounded off all\n\n1703\n01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:15,570\nthe objectives.\n\n1704\n01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,890\nSo if you're getting ready for that exam,\n\n1705\n01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:19,830\nmake sure you stay tuned for\nmore Windows 8.\n\n1706\n01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:21,350\nWe got a couple more\ngoing on this week and\n\n1707\n01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:24,050\nnext week, so definitely fun times there.\n\n1708\n01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:26,550\nAnd that's about all I've got.\n\n1709\n01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:27,600\nHow about you?\n\n1710\n01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,140\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1711\n01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,975\nGuess that's all I've, I got.\n\n1712\n01:26:30,975 --> 01:26:34,500\nSo go out there and\nplay with your PC and break it and\n\n1713\n01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,690\nso now you know how to fix it.\n\n1714\n01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:36,878\n>> There we go.\n>> And bring it back.\n\n1715\n01:26:36,878 --> 01:26:39,385\n>> [LAUGH] Then take it back\nto the store and return it.\n\n1716\n01:26:39,385 --> 01:26:44,520\n[LAUGH] All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, hope you enjoyed the show.\n\n1717\n01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,530\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n1718\n01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,880\nI'm Don Pezet.\n>> I'm Nathan Copeland.\n\n1719\n01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,887\n>> And

00:00:15,160\n>> Special edition.\n\n4\n00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,170\n>> Special edition where we cover just\nsome of these little one off topics\n\n5\n00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,310\nthe new stuff that was added\nthe Windows 8.1 exam updates\n\n6\n00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,620\nJanuary 2014 and\nI'm Nathan Copeland here with Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,030\n>> All right\n>> A little a little\n\n8\n00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,390\nlate introducing you here\n\n9\n00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,690\n>> Yes I see\n>> I got\n\n10\n00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,635\n>> A little exciting here\n\n11\n00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,390\n>> Mm-hm\n\n12\n00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,990\n>> I got kind of tied up a little bit.\n\n13\n00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,590\nNow excited about the recovery topic\nwe're about to start in on and\n\n14\n00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,020\nwe do want to make sure that.\n\n15\n00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,650\n>> As we go through, right?\n\n16\n00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,420\nRemember that in January 2014,\nthe exam did change.\n\n17\n00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,270\nAnd that means, that we are also\ngoing to be again refilming, or\n\n18\n00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,030\nrecovering, reshooting [LAUGH]\nthe episodes that actually\n\n19\n00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,220\nhave changed in terms of the a,\nof the content on the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,880\nNow, that doesn't mean\nthere's brand new content.\n\n21\n00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,410\nEven though some times it maybe.\n\n22\n00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,000\nBut it may be that some of the content\nthat wasn't called out in previous\n\n23\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,800\nversions is now called out.\n\n24\n00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,230\nAnd we want to make sure that you go\ninto the exam prepared with answers,\n\n25\n00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,090\nrather than just more questions.\n\n26\n00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,970\nSo today, our picker topic really\ncovers three different topics here\n\n27\n00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,380\nthat we have ready to go.\n\n28\n00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,399\nAnd let me see if I can\nfind those topics for us.\n\n29\n00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,670\n>> I'm probably going to win.\n\n30\n00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,191\n>> You ready [CROSSTALK] okay, so\non our site here, we of course, have in,\n\n31\n00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,909\nin the episode list there.\n\n32\n00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:35,890\nWe actually have the ones that we\nare going to be covering today.\n\n33\n00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,583\nFor us here at the bottom of the list\nhere are three of the topics here.\n\n34\n00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,005\nWe're going to be taking a look\nat the idea of configuring\n\n35\n00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:44,163\na recovery drive for us.\n\n36\n00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:47,315\nWe're going to talk about why we actually\nneed one and then we'll talk about how to\n\n37\n00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,801\ndo it and we'll actually do a demo of,\nof what we're going to do here.\n\n38\n00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:53,805\nWe're also going to be talking\nabout the use of system restore and\n\n39\n00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:56,415\nalso creating some restore points,\nand lastly,\n\n40\n00:01:56,415 --> 00:02:01,280\nwe're going to take a look at the idea\nof recovering files from SkyDrive.\n\n41\n00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,490\nToday we called it OneDrive.\n\n42\n00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,950\nRemember that there's actually been a name\nchange in that particular technology.\n\n43\n00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,410\nSo if you do see that on the exam,\nSkyDrive,\n\n44\n00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,980\neven though you've been studying it,\nit is now officially called OneDrive,\n\n45\n00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,740\nand that's because some foreign nation or\nsome foreign company sued Microsoft and\n\n46\n00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,230\nthey won and it was actually some\ntype of news division or something.\n\n47\n00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,770\n>> Yeah, like broadcasting or something.\n\n48\n00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,550\n>> Yeah, sky something.\n\n49\n00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,050\n>> Sky, Sky Media.\n\n50\n00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,670\n>> Yeah,\n>> Something like that.\n\n51\n00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,490\n>> I remember the whole story.\n\n52\n00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,100\n>> So, they won, and so today,\n\n53\n00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,420\nwe call it OneDrive, even though the exam\nyou may, you may see it a mixture of both.\n\n54\n00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:33,950\nOkay?\n\n55\n00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,480\n>> I guess it kind of\nmatches with the Xbox one.\n\n56\n00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,220\n>> Yes.\n\n57\n00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,750\n>> Right, one?\n\n58\n00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,610\n>> Yeah, the X Box one.\n\n59\n00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,310\nNow, 360 and\nthe next version of it was one?\n\n60\n00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,000\n>> Yeah.\n\n61\n00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000\n>> Yeah, that's pretty.\n\n62\n00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,661\n>> Yeah.\n>> How do you like,\n\n63\n00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,540\nhow do you like your Xbox one?\n\n64\n00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,570\n>> I would love it, if I actually had one.\n\n65\n00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,810\n>> Oh man.\n>> Yeah, I have the Xbox nothing.\n\n66\n00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,920\n>> The, the Xbox none?\n\n67\n00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,605\n>> Yeah, yeah mine is the why box.\n\n68\n00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:58,180\n>> [LAUGH] Why box.\n\n69\n00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,080\n>> Yeah\n>> Their next ex wife.\n\n70\n00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,470\n>> All right.\n\n71\n00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,110\nSo let's go on ahead to\ntalk about the features\n\n72\n00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,440\nthat we want to make sure that we\nunderstand in Windows 8.1, right.\n\n73\n00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,710\nWith the update here to Windows 8.1,\nremember,\n\n74\n00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,240\nwe are actually covering\nthese different topics here.\n\n75\n00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,320\nAnd we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that there are these recovery\n\n76\n00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,090\nfeatures that have been there really for\na while in terms of what we've had right?\n\n77\n00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,210\nAll operating systems have actually tried\nto make sure really since the days of XP,\n\n78\n00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,720\nand then Vista, and\nthen Windows 7, and now Windows 8.\n\n79\n00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,730\nWe actually have added\nin more that we can do,\n\n80\n00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,800\nto allow the operating system to\nrecover without really needing\n\n81\n00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,110\nto reinstall the operating\nsystem all the time.\n\n82\n00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,770\nOkay?\n\n83\n00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,480\nSo, included in those features for\n\n84\n00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,350\nus in Windows 8.1 are really two\nthings that we can actually do.\n\n85\n00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,920\nNow, if we go and take a look at,\nour machines here.\n\n86\n00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,600\nLet me go ahead and\nbring up my, Windows machine.\n\n87\n00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,640\nAnd I can actually log in here.\n\n88\n00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,030\nFor us what we're talking about is\nthe ability to do what we call a, oh no,\n\n89\n00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,110\nnot actually the ability to do that.\n\n90\n00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,550\nSystem refresh and system reset is what\nwe're actually talking about here.\n\n91\n00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,180\nAll right.\n\n92\n00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,290\nSo it's still not full screening.\n\n93\n00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,210\nSo I have actually,\ncompletely just hosed us on that one.\n\n94\n00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,580\n>> Yeah, and enhanced.\n\n95\n00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,850\n>> Yeah, enhanced, it,\nit still went and less enhanced.\n\n96\n00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,470\nYou all right?\n\n97\n00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,900\nIf I go to settings.\n\n98\n00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,620\nAnd you may have to help me out here.\n\n99\n00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,240\nLet's see.\n\n100\n00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,380\nOnce I'm actually inside the settings,\nI can go to.\n\n101\n00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,090\nControl panel.\n\n102\n00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,380\n>> Of your\n>> Oh, yep.\n\n103\n00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,860\nNo for the refresh, and reset.\n\n104\n00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,600\n>> Mm. Yeah >> Settings.\n\n105\n00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,760\n>> Settings and update and recovery.\n\n106\n00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,840\n>> Why am I not having update and\nrecovery here?\n\n107\n00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,960\n>> Oh you have to\n>> Go scroll down.\n\n108\n00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,740\nThere we go.\n\n109\n00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,010\nPC seven, it's like where did it go?\n\n110\n00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,545\nAnd now I go to update and recovery,\n[CROSSTALK] and recovery, and\n\n111\n00:04:57,545 --> 00:04:59,948\nI have to scroll down a little bit.\n\n112\n00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:03,405\nSo notice this is those are the two\noptions that we have available to us\n\n113\n00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,961\nwithout really needing to just\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n114\n00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:11,888\nIn the, first option there, notice it says\nthe refresher PC without affecting your\n\n115\n00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:16,025\nfiles here, it is one we can do and it\ntells us that we can actually use this to\n\n116\n00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:20,883\nhelp us to be able to the PC isn't running\nwell, you can refresh it without losing,\n\n117\n00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:24,737\nwell, essentially anything\nyou've put on the computer.\n\n118\n00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:29,147\nSo this will restore the Windows operating\nsystem files back into the state\n\n119\n00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:30,697\nthat it was originally designed to do.\n\n120\n00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,817\nSo you might actually be able to do that.\n\n121\n00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:35,507\nThe other one of course is\njust a regular fresh install,\n\n122\n00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:37,250\nwhat they call a reset here.\n\n123\n00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,220\nHere's what we have.\n\n124\n00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,210\nSo it actually reinstalls\nWindows all together.\n\n125\n00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,880\nNow for us to do the first one.\n\n126\n00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,700\nWhen you do tend to, when you do\nbuy your computer from a, a store,\n\n127\n00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,040\nnormally Windows 8.1 or 8 is actually\ngoing be loaded onto the computer itself.\n\n128\n00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,718\nAnd included in it is going\nto be what we call the.\n\n129\n00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:02,490\nRecovery partition, right?\n\n130\n00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,286\n>> Recovery partition.\n\n131\n00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:06,080\nYou know Ronnie, I didn't I didn't\nwant to cut you off at the time, but.\n\n132\n00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,890\nWith with refresh, you know.\n\n133\n00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,200\nI like to look at, at refresh as you know,\n\n134\n00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,510\nit's kind of like doing a,\nlike a easy transfer, right, you know?\n\n135\n00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,860\nEssentially what it you know, does is\njust reinstalls the operating system,\n\n136\n00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,200\nbut it, keeps all your files so,\nyou know, the,\n\n137\n00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,690\nthe way I kind of look at it is you know,\nif you were to run Windows easy transfer.\n\n138\n00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,000\nRight?\nAnd so it copies all your settings.\n\n139\n00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,060\nAnd you know, your files and\nall your personal information.\n\n140\n00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,250\nYou know and\nwhen you go to do a new computer or\n\n141\n00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,120\na different computer with\nthe fresh installed windows, and\n\n142\n00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,540\nyou run that that MigWiz and it you know,\nimports all your stuff back on there,\n\n143\n00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,020\nit, essentially that's kind of,\nwhat it is, what it is doing.\n\n144\n00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,500\nRacking up all your files,\nreinstalling the operating system, and\n\n145\n00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,725\nthen putting all your files back there.\n\n146\n00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:51,705\nAnd of course with the, with the bottom\none, it just wipes everything out.\n\n147\n00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:54,575\n>> Yeah.\nIt's like you're starting brand new, and\n\n148\n00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:57,485\nyou reinstall everything,\nyou might choose that option.\n\n149\n00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:00,435\nThat advantage of it today,\nis that we don't really need a disc.\n\n150\n00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:03,105\nAnd to tell the truth, you might be\nwondering why, why is that an advantage?\n\n151\n00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:06,815\nWell, like on my laptop right now,\nit's a little 12 inch laptop.\n\n152\n00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:08,490\nThere is no.\n\n153\n00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,230\nCD or DVD drive online.\n\n154\n00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,350\nAnd, and, and in that sense right, I\ndon't actually have a disk to recover to.\n\n155\n00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,260\nSo a lot of times today what you also\nsee is that on the hard drive itself\n\n156\n00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,640\nthe manufacturer goes ahead and\n\n157\n00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,030\nputs in what they call the recovery\npartition, which gives them the ability\n\n158\n00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,110\nto again reinstall the operating\nsystem if they need to.\n\n159\n00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,425\nAnd also gives us the ability to,\nto do either one of these two options.\n\n160\n00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:31,940\nMm-hm.\n\n161\n00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,510\n>> Okay.\n\n162\n00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,560\nBut sometimes though.\n\n163\n00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,460\n>> Okay.\n\n164\n00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,130\n>> Sometimes.\n\n165\n00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,960\n>> Sometimes, what can happen is that\nyou're so excited about this and\n\n166\n00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,020\nyou don't like all the extra stuff that\ncomes on the actual operating system\n\n167\n00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,300\nitself, you blow away everything\nincluding the recovery partition, okay?\n\n168\n00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,880\nAnd so what we need to\nactually be able to do then.\n\n169\n00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,897\nIs, if we need to,\n\n170\n00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:54,670\nwe need to actually be able to configure\nwhat we call a recovery drive.\n\n171\n00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:59,220\nThis is such an offload that recovery\npartition Really on to that drive when we\n\n172\n00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,208\nneed it, yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,008\nOn to it,\nin an external drive if we need it.\n\n174\n00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:04,521\n>> Hm, you know, or I, so my,\nmy, my first lap top, so.\n\n175\n00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,291\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's funny that you said that\n\n176\n00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,350\nyour first lap top was like\na tiny little seven inch screen.\n\n177\n00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,570\n>> Yes.\n\n178\n00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,860\n>> I mean really they made laptops that,\nthat small.\n\n179\n00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,194\nLike, like today, if you get\na laptop with a seven inch screen.\n\n180\n00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean that's, that's pretty small.\n\n181\n00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,010\n>> Yeah.\nThe screen was that small.\n\n182\n00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,088\nThe laptop itself was huge.\n\n183\n00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,423\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was about 20 pounds, just about.\n\n184\n00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:23,323\n>> Oh, oh, right?\n\n185\n00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:23,895\nOkay.\n\n186\n00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:24,952\n>> Yeah,\nabout the size of a small briefcase.\n\n187\n00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,066\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n188\n00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,737\n>> So, I mean,\nhow big were the bezels on it?\n\n189\n00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:30,558\nI mean, they were like, like that big?\n\n190\n00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:32,530\n>> [LAUGH] Well, they were big.\n\n191\n00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,090\n>> All right.\n\n192\n00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,020\n>> Let's put it that way, yeah.\n\n193\n00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,181\n>> So, so, my first laptop, my,\nmy first laptop I bought a Sony VAIO, and\n\n194\n00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:43,125\nit was the, the, the sweetest thing, and\noh man, I, I really enjoyed that laptop.\n\n195\n00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:48,065\nAnd it came with a six,\nsix of these recovery DVDs.\n\n196\n00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:49,972\n>> Nice.\n>> And it had I, actually I,\n\n197\n00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:52,073\nI think they were probably CDs,\nat the time.\n\n198\n00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,532\nCuz you had to pop, you know,\npop them in one after the other together.\n\n199\n00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:55,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As it restored the stuff.\n\n200\n00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,080\nBut yeah you know, ev,\nevery once in a while,\n\n201\n00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,570\nI'd hose the thing up\nmessing around with it.\n\n202\n00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,440\nAnd you know, when you pop in the the th,\nthe CDs and it runs through, and\n\n203\n00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,570\nit re, reinstalls your operating system.\n\n204\n00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,470\nThe, the next laptop I bought,\nwas a Toshiba satellite, and\n\n205\n00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,565\nit did not come with any, any DVDs.\n\n206\n00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:13,796\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n207\n00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:14,591\n>> One following that,\n\n208\n00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:17,365\nI had a ThinkPad for a little while,\nthat did not come with any discs.\n\n209\n00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:19,103\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And every, ever since that,\n\n210\n00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,980\nthat one VAIO, I don't get any, any disc.\n\n211\n00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,760\n>> Discs.\n\n212\n00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,360\n>> They're, they're all gone.\n\n213\n00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,140\n>> Yeah, they're just gone.\n\n214\n00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,155\n>> Now essentially those discs are now on\nthe hard drive in that recovery partition.\n\n215\n00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:27,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n216\n00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,470\n>> And, you know, which, you know, I'm,\nI was a big fan of the, of the discs.\n\n217\n00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,240\n>> Yeah.\n>> I kind of like it you know, its.\n\n218\n00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,500\n>> It'd be nice to have, so\n\n219\n00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,085\nthat in case anything does\nhappen to the hard drive itself.\n\n220\n00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n221\n00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,620\n>> That would be nice, but\na lot of times if you want that,\n\n222\n00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,700\nyou might have to call the manufacturer\nand say hey, I want it.\n\n223\n00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,094\nAnd they might say well,\nwe can send it to you, but\n\n224\n00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:47,760\nit will cost you x amount of money.\n\n225\n00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,380\nSo even though you've already paid for\nit, they'll charge you shipping,\n\n226\n00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,640\nor they'll say, no the media costs more.\n\n227\n00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,860\nAnd so that,\nthat's why they also charge it.\n\n228\n00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,195\nAgain, worth it, I think.\n\n229\n00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But in the end you may not have access\n\n230\n00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,350\nto that before you realize it.\n\n231\n00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,995\n>> Mh-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n232\n00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:04,210\nYeah, well you know, I mean, if,\nif, if we have the disc to send to,\n\n233\n00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,300\nwe can create our own recovery\npartition using this method.\n\n234\n00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,840\nAnd take a system image of our machine and\ncreate a partition and,\n\n235\n00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,880\nand flag it in there.\n\n236\n00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,760\nAnd then put the the other\nsystem image on there, and\n\n237\n00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,530\njust basically create the partition.\n\n238\n00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,100\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n239\n00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,580\nSo what happens if you, if you have a a,\n\n240\n00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,280\na computer that may not have\nthe recovery partition?\n\n241\n00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,690\nIs there a way we can create one?\n\n242\n00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,812\n>> Yes, yes there is.\n\n243\n00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:29,470\n>> Yes.\n>> Yep.\n\n244\n00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,345\nIt is a yep, a little command line tool.\n\n245\n00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That will create a system image and\n\n246\n00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,210\nallow you to create that that\nrecovery partition that you can use.\n\n247\n00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,572\n>> Mm-hm.\nDo you want to show us how to do it?\n\n248\n00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:42,210\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n249\n00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:42,995\n>> All right, sounds good.\n\n250\n00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:44,470\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right, yeah.\n\n251\n00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,710\nSo on, on my machine here.\n\n252\n00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,132\nLet let's get a command prompt open.\n\n253\n00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:54,271\n[SOUND].\n\n254\n00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,730\nAnd let me increase the font\nsize just a little bit.\n\n255\n00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,410\n16, is that good for you, Ronnie?\n\n256\n00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,260\n>> Sounds good.\n\n257\n00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,560\n>> All right.\n\n258\n00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,300\nAll right, so\nthere's a a little command line.\n\n259\n00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,067\nIt is called recimg.exe, right?\n\n260\n00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:12,930\nSo we'll just go and run that.\n\n261\n00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,018\nAnd there aren't there aren't too many,\ntoo many switches or\n\n262\n00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:17,110\nmodifiers on this guy.\n\n263\n00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,150\nWe get yep, just four.\n\n264\n00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,872\nSo create image, and set current,\nview register, and show current.\n\n265\n00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:27,525\nAll right, so what we can do then,\nis we'll just run that first.\n\n266\n00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,722\n[COUGH].\n\n267\n00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,000\nCreate image, all right?\n\n268\n00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,450\nAnd so, looking up there on that,\nmodifier on the very top.\n\n269\n00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,840\nSo create image and then, you know,\nin the little brackets there?\n\n270\n00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,340\nWhat do you call them, Ronnie?\n\n271\n00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,200\nAlligator mouths?\n\n272\n00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,730\n>> Sure.\n\n273\n00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,950\n>> With between the alligator\nmouths of the directory.\n\n274\n00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,490\nSo we just gotta put it somewhere.\n\n275\n00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,565\nAnd so for this one,\nC:/ we'll just call it,\n\n276\n00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:51,444\nSystemImage.\n\n277\n00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,120\nThat's it.\n\n278\n00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,070\nSo now what what this,\nwhat this guy's gonna do, is it you know,\n\n279\n00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,640\nit's creating a, a snapshot.\n\n280\n00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,380\nIt's gonna build up the little profile\nit's gonna do to create this image, and\n\n281\n00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,295\nnow it's gonna write this image.\n\n282\n00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:06,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n283\n00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that's really it.\n\n284\n00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,500\n>> Yeah, usually then,\nyou take that image and you do what?\n\n285\n00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,692\nYou, do you have a partition that\nyou can actually load it on to,\n\n286\n00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,590\nor you actually have another drive\nthat you can put that on to.\n\n287\n00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,986\nThen you can boot up to this,\nand you're ready to go.\n\n288\n00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You're ready to recover the image.\n\n289\n00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,980\n>> Yeah, yeah, you know, and, and for\nthis to be the, the recovery partition,\n\n290\n00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,675\nit has to be on a, a fixed drive.\n\n291\n00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,577\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you won't be able to put it on a,\n\n292\n00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:31,375\na USB thumb drive or\nany other type of removal media.\n\n293\n00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,680\nIt got to be on a, yep,\nfixed drive on the, on the machine.\n\n294\n00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n295\n00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,230\n>> So if you have, have for some reason,\nagain, just wiped clean the computer, and\n\n296\n00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,295\nstarted, and put everything on.\n\n297\n00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:44,060\nAnd you didn't actually have an,\na recovery partitioned on there, or\n\n298\n00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,618\nit's been blown away, you might actually\nhave to use this particular utility,\n\n299\n00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:51,840\nRECIMG here to actually\nbe able to create this.\n\n300\n00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,965\nAnd then once again, if you have another\npartition you have to set aside so\n\n301\n00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:58,170\nmuch space to actually make it work,\nthen you can do it.\n\n302\n00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,339\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n303\n00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,059\n>> Yeah.\n\n304\n00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,605\nNow, what if you're like me, and you\nactually still have the original one on\n\n305\n00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:08,315\nthere, but it's starting to\neat up hard drive space, okay?\n\n306\n00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:11,075\nTo the point where you go, wait a minute,\nit's taking him a good portion.\n\n307\n00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:14,060\nSo it can take, you know, 10, 15 gigs.\n\n308\n00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,565\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n309\n00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:17,100\n>> At times in terms of this\nparticular partition here.\n\n310\n00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,560\nWell, you can then move that and\ncreate what we call a recovery drive.\n\n311\n00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,900\nNow, in creating the recovery drive,\n\n312\n00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,820\nwe have to have the core with\nthe recover partition already on there.\n\n313\n00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,170\nBut then you need a USB\ndrive of some sort, so\n\n314\n00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,760\nthat you can offload that\non to a recovery drive.\n\n315\n00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,950\nAnd a lot of times it will tell you when\nyou do run it, what size drive that you\n\n316\n00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,910\nactually need and if you actually put one\nin there and it's not big enough it will\n\n317\n00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,740\ntell you, you don't have the sufficient\nsize drive that you need, okay?\n\n318\n00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,946\nSo, let me go ahead and show you what,\nwhat we're actually doing here,\n\n319\n00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:52,300\nand then I will also create one\nat the same time here, okay?\n\n320\n00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,910\nI'm just going to go ahead and\nslide my USB drive in.\n\n321\n00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:04,425\nAnd then, from there I go to my start\nscreen, and I type in let's see, recovery.\n\n322\n00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,001\n>> Recovery dr, yep.\n\n323\n00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:09,996\n>> And notice that there's an option\nthere that says to create a recovery\n\n324\n00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:10,600\ndrive, okay?\n\n325\n00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,630\nNow before I do that,\n\n326\n00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,060\nlet me show you what I'm talking about\nin terms of eating up drive space here.\n\n327\n00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,640\nI didn't realize this until I was looking\nat it this morning because I just don't\n\n328\n00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:26,800\npay attention, I have a 250 gig solid\nstate drive on this particular computer.\n\n329\n00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,210\nIt went from original Windows 8,\nokay, and then I upgraded to 8.1,\n\n330\n00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,225\nand it created more recovery\npartitions than I ever thought, okay?\n\n331\n00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:39,640\nSo it was quite impressive and when we\ntake a look at this here in a moment.\n\n332\n00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,277\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'll see what I mean.\n\n333\n00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:42,805\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's all these\n\n334\n00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:45,635\nare actually marked as\nactually recovery partitions.\n\n335\n00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,435\nAll right, and there,\nthere's a recovery partition there.\n\n336\n00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:48,165\nOh, look at that.\n\n337\n00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:50,225\nThere's another recovery partition.\n\n338\n00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:51,525\nHere's another one.\n\n339\n00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,495\nWell, look right there.\n\n340\n00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,025\nThere's another one as well.\n\n341\n00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:57,790\nSo, there's a lot of recovery partitions\non this, it's cuz it's actually doing both\n\n342\n00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,810\nFor Windows 8 as well as\n8.1 is what we have, okay?\n\n343\n00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,760\nNow, if I've already upgraded,\n\n344\n00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,250\nonly one of those is actually\nreally the effective one here.\n\n345\n00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,935\nThe good thing is I have, and\nthat now means I can go back.\n\n346\n00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:14,390\n>> And again,\nI'm just gonna type in recovery, and\n\n347\n00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,550\nI can re create the recovery\ndrive at this point.\n\n348\n00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,510\nAnd notice here what it gives\nme the option to do, okay?\n\n349\n00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:27,210\nSo you can use the recovery drive to help\ntrouble shoot even if your PC can't start.\n\n350\n00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,850\nYour PC camera with a recovery partition.\n\n351\n00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,970\nYou can also copy it to the recovery drive\nso you can use it to refresh or reset it.\n\n352\n00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,680\nSo, this is actually a very good utility.\n\n353\n00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,760\nI can offload it, and\nthen in the end here,\n\n354\n00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,060\nyou'll actually see it gives me\nan option to do something else.\n\n355\n00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,090\nBut notice it says copy\nthe recover partition.\n\n356\n00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,894\nIf I just want to create just\nkind of a troubleshooting disk,\n\n357\n00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:50,250\nI can do that as well,\nby simply just unchecking that, okay?\n\n358\n00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,267\nAnd not copying any of the information\nOver, but I want to go ahead and\n\n359\n00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:55,800\ndo that, and click next.\n\n360\n00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,323\n>> So, yeah, [CROSSTALK] that just gives\nyou the option to take the recovery part\n\n361\n00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:04,164\nof your partition and\nstick it on the on your, on your drive.\n\n362\n00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,398\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know yeah,\n\n363\n00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:09,290\nbefore the show and I was creating my,\nmy sys system image.\n\n364\n00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,300\nI, I tried to put it on a USB key.\n\n365\n00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,000\nSo I don't have to put on this,\non this hard drive.\n\n366\n00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,078\nAnd yeah, it, it, it bought that and\nyou said no, no, no.\n\n367\n00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:16,750\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n368\n00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,270\n>> This has to be on a fixed,\non a fixed draft.\n\n369\n00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,410\n>> Yeah?\n>> Yeah, I guess.\n\n370\n00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,380\nI guess maybe creating it has\nto be on a fixed drive but,\n\n371\n00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,992\nafter it's created then I guess\napparently you can move it around.\n\n372\n00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:31,390\n>> Yeah, and so you can actually see\nright here, this one just tells me,\n\n373\n00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,230\nit says the drive must be able\nto hold at least eight gigs.\n\n374\n00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,150\nEverything on that drive will be deleted,\nso don't put this on a drive that\n\n375\n00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,150\nyou were backing up everything to\n>> So\n\n376\n00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,800\nthis is where you're keeping\nall of your family photos.\n\n377\n00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,365\nNot a good drive for\nyou to actually think about doing that to.\n\n378\n00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:45,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n379\n00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,220\n>> Somebody may get upset.\n\n380\n00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,930\nYou know.\n>> Right.\n\n381\n00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,340\n>> So, notice it actually does tell\nyou if you have available drive.\n\n382\n00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,290\nNow, if you don't have any,\nit won't show any here, okay?\n\n383\n00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,230\nSo, it will tell you how\nbig the drive that you need\n\n384\n00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,040\n>> You go next, and\n\n385\n00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240\nthen it tells you everything that's\ngonna be deleted at that point, and\n\n386\n00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480\nthen we can go ahead and click create.\n\n387\n00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,340\nAnd now it's gonna format and\nit's gonna do that.\n\n388\n00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,820\nNow it's gonna take several minutes for\nit to do this in, in the end and\n\n389\n00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,285\nso as it's actually\nrunning in the background.\n\n390\n00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:13,795\nWe'll let it run and let it create\nits recovery drive at this point.\n\n391\n00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:14,435\nOkay?\n\n392\n00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:16,375\n>> Yeah, you know, and, Ronnie,\nif I'm not mistaken, the,\n\n393\n00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,745\nthe recovery drive,\nit must be on a USB drive.\n\n394\n00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:20,315\n>> Yeah.\n>> So if,\n\n395\n00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:24,885\nif you know, if you have a, some other\nyou know, portable hard drive or\n\n396\n00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,555\nsomething that's not\nrecognized as a USB drive.\n\n397\n00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:29,385\n>> Yeah.\n>> It it will not work.\n\n398\n00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:30,135\n>> Yeah.\n\n399\n00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,370\nSo usually again, just.\n\n400\n00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,950\nGet these USB keys.\n\n401\n00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,850\nUsually at least 8 gigs.\n\n402\n00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,893\nI, you can probably get 16 gigs one for\nabout $16 today.\n\n403\n00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or even cheaper than that,\n\n404\n00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,985\nso worth getting.\n\n405\n00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:43,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n406\n00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,330\n>> You know?\nWorth actually having.\n\n407\n00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,660\nThis way I can offload this.\n\n408\n00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,950\nNow if the hard drives are small, right?\n\n409\n00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,805\nIn the end here, I'm, I'm not gonna wait,\nwe'll see it in the end maybe.\n\n410\n00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And depending on how much time we have.\n\n411\n00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,400\nBut in the end it's gonna go ahead and\ngive me the option to delete\n\n412\n00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,650\nthose recovery partitions, and\nin that I'm gonna recover like 25 or\n\n413\n00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,160\n30 gigs, because it actually has\nsaved a lot of information on there.\n\n414\n00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,160\nSo it's also compressing everything down\nhere on this little 8 gig drive, so so\n\n415\n00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,620\nit's it's doing quite a bit.\n\n416\n00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,900\n>> All right, are you going to do that?\n\n417\n00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,392\nAre you going to delete your.\n\n418\n00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:15,675\n>> We, we may, we'll, we'll see.\n\n419\n00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:16,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n420\n00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,230\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right.\n\n421\n00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,550\n>> Right.\n>> So now on this on the recovery drive\n\n422\n00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:26,130\nthis is also going to put\non the the Windows RE,\n\n423\n00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,610\nthe Recovery Environment\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n424\n00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,590\n>> The tools that you need you know,\nto be able to get into the recovery\n\n425\n00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,170\npartion-\n>> Yeah.\n\n426\n00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,410\n>> Restore, restore your PC.\n\n427\n00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:32,990\n>> That's it.\n\n428\n00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,750\n>> In case of a a failure.\n\n429\n00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,300\n>> Yeah, so once the if\nthe computer fails at this point,\n\n430\n00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,710\nthen I can reboot the actual PC, and\n\n431\n00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,075\nactually have it boot up to that USB drive\nand then choose the options that I need.\n\n432\n00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:46,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n433\n00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,670\n>> Yeah, real slick system.\n\n434\n00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,620\n>> Yeah, yeah, it is.\n\n435\n00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,560\nNow, now Serrano,\njust let me ask you this.\n\n436\n00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,190\n>> Okay?\n\n437\n00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,670\n>> So, so, since,\nsince you've been running Windows 8.\n\n438\n00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n439\n00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:58,820\n>> How many times have, have you hosed\nup so bad that you've had to refresh it,\n\n440\n00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,740\nreset it, or just, you know,\nwipe everything out and\n\n441\n00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,970\njust start from the,\nfrom absolute bare minimum?\n\n442\n00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,810\n>> I have not had to do it.\n\n443\n00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,860\n>> No?\n>> No, I have not.\n\n444\n00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> No, yeah.\n\n445\n00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,870\nYeah, I'm, I'm relatively careful with\nthe, the, the operating system, itself.\n\n446\n00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,830\nI try not to hose it up too bad.\n\n447\n00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,680\nEarly on when I owned computers,\nI would hose it up so badly,\n\n448\n00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,070\nI couldn't get back into it.\n\n449\n00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,750\nFigured out how to do it.\n\n450\n00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,480\nI had a friend that could, could just\nsimply change a lettering on something and\n\n451\n00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,565\nhe could never get back into it.\n\n452\n00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So I've been lucky.\n\n453\n00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,850\nBut I've been trying to actually\nkeep this machine nice and, and not,\n\n454\n00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,420\nnot not experiment, too much.\n\n455\n00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,370\n>> So, so would it be safe to say\nthat that, that currently, as of now,\n\n456\n00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,510\nthat you do not have a recovery solution\nset up in case you did hose up that PC?\n\n457\n00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,030\n>> I do.\n\n458\n00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,885\nI have a backup.\n\n459\n00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:45,180\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n460\n00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,210\n>> Yeah,\nI actually have a true system image.\n\n461\n00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,816\n>> Oh, yeah?\n>> That I can actually back up to.\n\n462\n00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:48,328\nYeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n463\n00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,440\n>> I do.\n\n464\n00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,340\n>> Oh that's right.\n\n465\n00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,830\nIn the the the backup show.\n\n466\n00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,910\n>> That's right.\n>> The backup show.\n\n467\n00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,410\nSo it once, once a month?\n\n468\n00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,165\n>> I do, once a month.\n\n469\n00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:56,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n470\n00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,630\nHm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n471\n00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,930\n>> Nice.\nThat's right.\n\n472\n00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n473\n00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,580\n>> So you wanna make sure that you're\nstill doing the regular things.\n\n474\n00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,520\nIn other words, don't just count on this.\n\n475\n00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,290\nMake sure you also go back and\nyou think about also,\n\n476\n00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,740\nagain, keeping the idea of backups\non hand is pretty much a key\n\n477\n00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,573\naspect of having a good solid recovery,\nfor what we want to do.\n\n478\n00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:16,217\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n479\n00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,078\n>> All right?\n\n480\n00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:19,460\nYeah.\n>> Well, you know, on on your PC there,\n\n481\n00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,660\nit still is, is kind of grinding away\nat it, yeah, so what, yeah, what.\n\n482\n00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,520\nWhat shall we do should\nwe take a break and.\n\n483\n00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,380\n>> No,\nwe have got a little bit of time here so\n\n484\n00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,812\nwe can go ahead and talk about the idea\nof some system restore points.\n\n485\n00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:36,540\n>> Okay.\n>> While we have actually got\n\n486\n00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,740\na chance here to do this, okay.\n\n487\n00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,020\nNow system restore has actually been\naround for, well quite a bit of time if I\n\n488\n00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,850\ncan actually find the right machine\nthat I need to go to here okay.\n\n489\n00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,720\nSystem restore has been around for\nFor a lot, okay?\n\n490\n00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,610\nNow, the ideal system restore for\nus, gives us the ability, of course,\n\n491\n00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,850\nto revert the operating system files\nback to a previous point in time.\n\n492\n00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,890\nNow, why might that be beneficial, for us?\n\n493\n00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,550\nDo you have any clue why\nthat might be beneficial?\n\n494\n00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,250\n>> Oh, goodness.\n\n495\n00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,870\nI guess if you did host things up if\nyou have a instance of bad drivers or\n\n496\n00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,910\nsomething that you're unable to get\ninto the PC to roll those drivers back.\n\n497\n00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,795\nI guess we, I, so it could be for\nyou know malware removal sort.\n\n498\n00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> In a, in a sense, of course\n\n499\n00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,750\nI guess I'm kind of sketchy about malware,\njust wipe the whole thing out.\n\n500\n00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,320\nBut yeah, I guess to just revert\ninadvertent, revert inadvertent changes.\n\n501\n00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,345\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n502\n00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:35,370\n>> Yeah.\nSometimes you can install files or you can\n\n503\n00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,760\nchange something on the PC, where all of\na sudden you can't get back into the PC,\n\n504\n00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,380\nor it changes the system so much it's\njust not as operational as it used to be.\n\n505\n00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,470\nThe ability to roll back the computers\nsystem state back to a previous point\n\n506\n00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,170\nin time, before the changes happened,\nmeans that the computer acts like no,\n\n507\n00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,140\nnone of the changes actually happened.\n\n508\n00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,500\nSo, for example, what I actually\nhave set up here, okay, is I have\n\n509\n00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,980\na particular little, installer that\nI actually just downloaded here.\n\n510\n00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,780\nAnd let's say that,\nI thought that everything was fine.\n\n511\n00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,850\nAnd this is gonna install just fine, I,\nI, I tried it a little bit earlier here.\n\n512\n00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,050\nSo, what would normally actually end up\nhappening is you install the program,\n\n513\n00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,450\nyou find out it doesn't work.\n\n514\n00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,000\nYou try and remove it.\n\n515\n00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,970\nYou do the uninstall, and let's say it\nactually leaves parts of it behind, okay?\n\n516\n00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,470\nYou still see, like,\nthe icon showing up on the desktop,\n\n517\n00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,230\nyou still see all these other things\nthat are actually going on here.\n\n518\n00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,870\nYou can roll back the system state to\nwhere the actual computer acts like that,\n\n519\n00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,290\nparticular.\n\n520\n00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,400\nProgram wasn't actually installed before,\nso it actually does help.\n\n521\n00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,200\nNow, it doesn't remove the program itself,\nso\n\n522\n00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,920\nit doesn't actually affect\nyour files here, but\n\n523\n00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,860\nlet's make sure we actually have all the\nprerequisites that we need set up, 'kay?\n\n524\n00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,230\nFirst thing we need to do\nis verify that the computer\n\n525\n00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,000\nis actually running the system restore,\nokay?\n\n526\n00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,390\nSo for us,\ncouple ways where we can get access to it.\n\n527\n00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,760\nI'm just gonna go to the Windows Explorer,\n\n528\n00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,100\nI'm gonna right click on\nthis PC over here, and\n\n529\n00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,910\nI'm gonna go down to properties at this\npoint to bring up the system properties.\n\n530\n00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,510\nYour course can get there\nin multiple ways, right.\n\n531\n00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,640\nYou can go through control panel,\nyou can do different ways here.\n\n532\n00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,350\nBut I'm just gonna do it this way cuz it's\nactually fast and easy at this point.\n\n533\n00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,130\nOver on the left-hand side,\nyou see this column over here and\n\n534\n00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,700\nyou see where it says System Protection.\n\n535\n00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,650\nIf I select system protection and\nof course, now,\n\n536\n00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,590\nif everything were full screen nicely for\nme, it didn't.\n\n537\n00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,340\nNotice that I have where it\nsays the protection is on.\n\n538\n00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,680\nAnd there's my recovery drive.\n\n539\n00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,550\nWe'll talk about it in a moment.\n\n540\n00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,930\nStart shooting up in the background there.\n\n541\n00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,660\nSo there it is.\n\n542\n00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,230\nAnd if it actually says it's off,\n\n543\n00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,490\nyou won't be able to actually\ndo these restore points.\n\n544\n00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,030\nBut if it's on, you can.\n\n545\n00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,331\n'Kay?\nSo, once that is actually turned on,\n\n546\n00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:53,966\nyou can configure it to make\nit actually turn on here for\n\n547\n00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,420\neach drive you want to or for.\n\n548\n00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,050\nframe one drive.\n\n549\n00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,720\nI can select create, well maybe.\n\n550\n00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:08,995\nAnd then let's go ahead and put in before,\ninstalling mine is Magic Isin.\n\n551\n00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:15,120\nOkay, I can go ahead then make that.\n\n552\n00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,720\nNow, a lot of the newer programs will\ngo ahead and run a system restore point\n\n553\n00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,180\non your computer, before they actually\ninstall it, that way when you do roll\n\n554\n00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,620\nit back, it actually just cleans\nup everything for you nicely.\n\n555\n00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,340\nBut some of the older programs don't,\nand this one's a little bit older.\n\n556\n00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,240\n>> And, you know,\nI also believe that installing critical\n\n557\n00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,090\nupdates-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n558\n00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,960\n>> And definitely like the service\npacks and, you know, large up,\n\n559\n00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,380\nupdates for the operating system that'll\nautomatically create restore points.\n\n560\n00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> And isn't it\n\n561\n00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,090\nit creates creates a restore point\n>> Automatically also every 24 hours.\n\n562\n00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:46,975\n>> Every 24 hours as well.\n\n563\n00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:47,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay?\n\n564\n00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,700\nSo that's how you actually go ahead and\nconfigure it.\n\n565\n00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,990\nIf I go ahead and install th is now,\nnotice oh, there it is.\n\n566\n00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,660\nThis one has compatibility issues.\n\n567\n00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,115\nOf course we're gonna throw caution\nto the wind, and let it run without.\n\n568\n00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:03,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Without getting help online.\n\n569\n00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,150\nAnd look, everybody remember this nice\nblue and, and gradient background for\n\n570\n00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:07,865\ninstallation of.\n\n571\n00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:08,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n572\n00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,600\n>> You know, and, and\nthis neat little thing here, there you go.\n\n573\n00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,509\nClick next and just let it install.\n\n574\n00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:16,720\nAnd there you go.\n\n575\n00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,590\nOkay, so it's just installing in\nthe background and it's fairly quick.\n\n576\n00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,240\n>> And there it is.\n\n577\n00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,860\nOh, look at that.\n\n578\n00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,450\nAn error popped up.\n\n579\n00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,830\nMagic disk can't open.\n\n580\n00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,440\nMake sure that you run\nit as an administrator.\n\n581\n00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,155\nSounds easy enough.\n\n582\n00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:29,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n583\n00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,030\n>> Right, so there's the little icon.\n\n584\n00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,420\nI'll right click, run as administrator.\n\n585\n00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,760\nOh no.\n\n586\n00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,970\nYeah, I'm host.\n\n587\n00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,330\n>> Right you know I think,\nyou know another host here was Bryan.\n\n588\n00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,470\nI think he still has his his application\ncompatibility tool kit lab set up.\n\n589\n00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,210\n>> There you go.\n\n590\n00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,720\n>> Should we hurry and\nmake some shims for this?\n\n591\n00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,011\n>> We should make some shims.\n\n592\n00:25:50,011 --> 00:25:52,920\n[LAUGH] No we should actually just\nremove it is what we should do.\n\n593\n00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,600\nOkay.\n\n594\n00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,990\nSo the good thing is this\nprogram does come with,\n\n595\n00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,540\nan uninstaller which is perfectly fine and\n\n596\n00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,080\nit does work cuz I've tried it again\nbefore, [LAUGH] So, let me see, magic.\n\n597\n00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,750\nI don't, there it is.\n\n598\n00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,958\nUninstall magic disc [SOUND] there.\n\n599\n00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,670\nAnd there it is,\nsays hey what do i want to do here.\n\n600\n00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,240\nI'm just gonna let it do automatic finish.\n\n601\n00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,205\nAnd that normally is enough.\n\n602\n00:26:18,205 --> 00:26:21,100\nOkay, but lets say I rebooted and\n\n603\n00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,510\nthe icon continued to show up,\nit continued to pop up.\n\n604\n00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,910\nIt left files behind, in other words\nit's still actually in the program file,\n\n605\n00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,600\nthere's still a folder in there.\n\n606\n00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,390\nstuff like that.\n\n607\n00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,770\nThere isn't because they\nactually improve on this.\n\n608\n00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,790\nA version I was running earlier didn't but\n\n609\n00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,680\nof course I couldn't remember\nwhat version that was.\n\n610\n00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,330\nI didn't want to download every\nsingle one to figure it out.\n\n611\n00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,070\nSo at this point here, that's what\nwould actually end up happening.\n\n612\n00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,145\nNow, if that were happening, and\nI needed to, I can then come back\n\n613\n00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:54,900\nto the restore here.\n\n614\n00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,200\nAt this time I'm not going\nto create a restore point,\n\n615\n00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,990\nI just want to get back to\nthis relatively quickly, here.\n\n616\n00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,770\nThen, I can go back to System Restore,\nto that same menu,\n\n617\n00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,990\nand now notice there is, you can see what\nI've done a little bit earlier here.\n\n618\n00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,170\n>> So whichever one is the later time.\n\n619\n00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,230\nThere it is, that one.\n\n620\n00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,420\nAnd then I can click Next and\nlet it finish.\n\n621\n00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,225\nIt says, hey, don't interrupt this if\nyou want this process to go through.\n\n622\n00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,315\nAnd And then I can actually uninstall.\n\n623\n00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:27,510\n>> Mm, 'kay.\n\n624\n00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,375\n>> You can do this also\nfrom the safe mode as well.\n\n625\n00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:33,820\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, you know you know\nonce during the system restore.\n\n626\n00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,380\nIt I, I powered off my PC on purpose.\n\n627\n00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,830\n>> Oh.\n>> Cuz I didn't want to I didn't\n\n628\n00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,420\nwant to wait.\n\n629\n00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,240\nAnd you know what happened?\n\n630\n00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,950\nIt when I powered it back on,\nit just resumed its little thing, and\n\n631\n00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,910\neverything went fine.\n\n632\n00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,740\n>> Nice.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n633\n00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n634\n00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:46,840\nYeah.\n\n635\n00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n636\n00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,560\nSo that for us normally cleans\neverything up and in the end we'll get\n\n637\n00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,610\na verification when we log back in when\neverything's actually up and running and\n\n638\n00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,330\ntell us that it was successful, or\nit'll tell us it wasn't successful.\n\n639\n00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,440\nUsually it's relatively successful here,\nokay.\n\n640\n00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,000\n>> Hm.\n>> Alright so right before our break as we\n\n641\n00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,005\ncome back, we've got just one\nmore topic to cover after this.\n\n642\n00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:06,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we,\n\n643\n00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,180\nwe might just go a little bit longer,\nand then make sure we cover it.\n\n644\n00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,940\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n645\n00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,590\nYeah, yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n646\n00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,410\n>> But you mean, SkyDrive?\n\n647\n00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,650\n>> Yeah.\n>> The next one?\n\n648\n00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,265\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n649\n00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:16,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n650\n00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,770\n>> Alright, so, recovery drive is ready.\n\n651\n00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,350\nOkay, so notice that.\n\n652\n00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,820\nAnd notice right here,\n\n653\n00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,100\nin the lower left-hand corner, it tells\nus that I delete my recovery parts.\n\n654\n00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,350\nWe're not going to do that right now.\n\n655\n00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,020\n>> Oh, come on.\n\n656\n00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,040\nDon't pass on the line.\n\n657\n00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,180\n>> No, cause I need this drive for\nsomething else right now.\n\n658\n00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,492\nBut I have another one,\nthat would be different, I don't\n\n659\n00:28:36,492 --> 00:28:39,220\n>> Alright, alright.\n\n660\n00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,930\n>> Okay.\nSo\n\n661\n00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,010\nyou can also delete this\nrecovery partition.\n\n662\n00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,170\nAnd that's what it tells you,\nsays to free up some space.\n\n663\n00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,280\nSo they are considering that,\nand there you go.\n\n664\n00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,540\nNow what actually appears in the drive\nitself here, get rid of all this stuff.\n\n665\n00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,600\n>> And just the other day, you said,\noh hey look, I'm running out of space.\n\n666\n00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,360\n>> I am.\n\n667\n00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,560\nAnd so there it is.\n\n668\n00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,200\n>> These are just.\n\n669\n00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,450\n>> It's just like a, a Windows disc,\nis what actually appears right here.\n\n670\n00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,900\nYou can now insert it in, reboot the PC,\nand you can tell that as you boot up\n\n671\n00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,140\nthis drive,\n>> Cool.\n\n672\n00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,250\n>> And there it will give you those\noptions that you would on a regular\n\n673\n00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,208\nrecovery environment disc as well.\n\n674\n00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,089\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n675\n00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,390\nHm.\nNice.\n\n676\n00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,510\nYeah, you know so, so\nmine in the background,\n\n677\n00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,840\nyou know that one also finished.\n\n678\n00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,420\nYou know, and mine looks a a little,\na little different.\n\n679\n00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,210\n>> A little different.\n\n680\n00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,610\nOkay.\n>> On mine.\n\n681\n00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,800\nAlright, so let me click,\nclick back here, alright.\n\n682\n00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,450\nSo it, it it did finish.\n\n683\n00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,630\n>> Okay.\n>> So the recovery image creation and\n\n684\n00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,240\nregistration completed successfully.\n\n685\n00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,420\n>> Nice.\n\n686\n00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,500\n>> Ba da dum!\n\n687\n00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,210\nAnd so if we go back into the folder\nwhere we put it there's mine.\n\n688\n00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,510\n>> Oh, custom web yeah.\n\n689\n00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,820\n>> So customrefresh.web, yep.\n\n690\n00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,850\nThere we go.\nLine net, a little different but\n\n691\n00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,490\none little file.\n\n692\n00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,460\n>> Nice, yeah.\n\n693\n00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n694\n00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,420\n>> So both ways here right,\nare really kind of key.\n\n695\n00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,350\nOne is creating that partition\nif you don't have it, and\n\n696\n00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,480\nthat way you can actually store it there.\n\n697\n00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,690\nAnd get it ready to go.\n\n698\n00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,680\nThe other way is essentially\noff loading it so\n\n699\n00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,670\nthat we can now have it on a USB thumb\ndrive here, and then put it back.\n\n700\n00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,590\nFreeing up some hard drive space, but also\nnot depending on the hard drive in case\n\n701\n00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,735\nthat partition end or the physical drive\nitself fails, or the drive itself fails,\n\n702\n00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:14,220\nall the partitions will fail as well.\n\n703\n00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,765\n>> mm-hm.\n\n704\n00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:18,645\nYeah, you know, and\nsince it did create a a win file,\n\n705\n00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:22,635\nyou reckon that we could you know, fire\nup like DISM or something and you know,\n\n706\n00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:27,190\nload I guess other programs, or\njust load stuff into this, this move file?\n\n707\n00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,720\n>> You can try.\n\n708\n00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,950\nYeah.\n>> All right.\n\n709\n00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,600\n>> You can try.\n>> Maybe after the show.\n\n710\n00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> Load that steam client in there.\n\n711\n00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,680\n>> You load the Steam client right up.\n\n712\n00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,500\n>> That's right.\n\n713\n00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,420\n>> That should.\n\n714\n00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,110\n>> Nice.\n>> All right.\n\n715\n00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,290\nNow our last little bit is\nabout recovering dri, or\n\n716\n00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,640\nfiles from SkyDrive here, okay?\n\n717\n00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,950\nNow by default,\nlet me say I open up a program.\n\n718\n00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,600\nJust a spreadsheet program,\nmine's Excel right here.\n\n719\n00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,110\nThat I have.\n\n720\n00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:56,040\nIf I go ahead and\njust create a new workbook at this point.\n\n721\n00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,950\nSome data.\n\n722\n00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,600\nYou know?\n\n723\n00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,100\nYep.\n\n724\n00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,830\nAnd then I go to save\nit automatically here.\n\n725\n00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,250\nI go to Save and File Save.\n\n726\n00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,520\nNotice by default where it wants to save\nit, which is in My One Drive account.\n\n727\n00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,130\nNow I already do have it in\nan actual One Drive account.\n\n728\n00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,980\nI sign in on my machine with\na Microsoft account here.\n\n729\n00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,000\nAnd that automatically connects up so\nit wants to save it up into the,\n\n730\n00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,295\nthe cloud, that,\nthat useful term in the world here.\n\n731\n00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:28,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It wants to actually save\n\n732\n00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,450\nit up into the actual OneDrive account for\nus right away.\n\n733\n00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:32,990\nOkay.\n\n734\n00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:38,300\nSo if I go ahead and do that,\nI can now save it up there and\n\n735\n00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,705\nwe'll call this one test scores.\n\n736\n00:31:39,705 --> 00:31:40,971\nHigh scores.\n\n737\n00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:41,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n738\n00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yikes.\n\n739\n00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,216\nThere we go.\nNice.\n\n740\n00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:49,216\nAlright.\n\n741\n00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:49,756\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n742\n00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:50,456\n>> So, there it is.\n\n743\n00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:53,336\nThe high scores are actually up there for\nus, and\n\n744\n00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:55,829\n>> [LAUGH] So one, 135 so those are your,\n\n745\n00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:57,546\nyour floppy bird high scores.\n\n746\n00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,745\n>> Floppy bird high scores.\n\n747\n00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:03,870\n[LAUGH] My floppy board,\nbird, high scores is zero.\n\n748\n00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,770\n>> All right, you,\nwhat you never even played.\n\n749\n00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,470\n>> No, I, I, kill,\n\n750\n00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,570\nI've not actually successfully caught,\nencountered floppy birds here, a, at all.\n\n751\n00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,825\nI hit the first column and I'm done.\n\n752\n00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:18,515\n[LAUGH] And after I did that for\nabout 46 times I just decided to give up.\n\n753\n00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:19,940\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, so I was done.\n\n754\n00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n755\n00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,430\nSo there it is.\n\n756\n00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:26,890\nThere's the high scores and it is saved\nup into the skydrive here for us,\n\n757\n00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,015\nand if I go and find my so\nI actually also logged in at.\n\n758\n00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:35,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On the one drive account here\n\n759\n00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,120\nthrough the web browser.\n\n760\n00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,340\nI'm trying to see if I\ncan refresh this page.\n\n761\n00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:41,850\nGo.\n\n762\n00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,310\nSo there's the, the new one.\n\n763\n00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:48,610\nSo I'm connected through the web, you also\nhave it through the the Windows tile.\n\n764\n00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,230\nFunction as well, so there they are, okay.\n\n765\n00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:56,600\nNow the nice thing is, as it's actually\nup there, right, what if I were to\n\n766\n00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,848\nhave that same issue here?\n\n767\n00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:05,190\nAnd let's say that I want\nto open other workbooks.\n\n768\n00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,750\nSkyDrive,\n>> OneDrive\n\n769\n00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,890\n>> And one drive, or one drive, yep.\n\n770\n00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,430\nI see?\n\n771\n00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,960\nOkay,\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n772\n00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,870\n>> And let's say we were to\nright-click on it, and delete.\n\n773\n00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,220\nOh.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n774\n00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,060\n>> Delete.\n>> Yes.\n\n775\n00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,070\n>> Are you sure you want to\npermanently delete this file?\n\n776\n00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,010\nYes.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n777\n00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,070\n>> Yes I do.\nAll right, there we go.\n\n778\n00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,750\nSo I've deleted it out,\nshouldn't have access to it anymore.\n\n779\n00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,490\nThere we go.\n\n780\n00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,650\nAll right.\n\n781\n00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,010\nNow in this sense, it would be gone\nfrom the Windrive here, maybe.\n\n782\n00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,850\nIt's gonna show up again.\n\n783\n00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,825\nNope.\nSee, it's gone.\n\n784\n00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:41,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I don't have it.\n\n785\n00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,200\nRight?\n\n786\n00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,360\nWell what can I do?\n\n787\n00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,750\nWell the nice thing is OneDrive doesn't\nreally believe you when you actually say\n\n788\n00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,490\nyes from an application.\n\n789\n00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,440\nI want to finally delete something.\n\n790\n00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,430\nOneDrive really says you really\ndidn't want to do that so\n\n791\n00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,270\nlet me send it to, like,\na recycle bin if I need it.\n\n792\n00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,840\nOkay.\n\n793\n00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,490\nNow actually here,\nif I go back to just to the web, page.\n\n794\n00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,610\nLet me go ahead and\nrefresh it and make sure.\n\n795\n00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,400\n>> Notice it really\ndidn't delete it at all.\n\n796\n00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,310\n>> Oh, there it goes.\n\n797\n00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,820\n>> Yeah.\n\n798\n00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,500\nNow it actually deleted it.\n\n799\n00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,140\nNow, if I go back to recycle bin though,\nlook at that.\n\n800\n00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,920\n>> Hm.\n>> I can actually go here.\n\n801\n00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,520\nI can right click and restore.\n\n802\n00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,380\nHm.\n\n803\n00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,160\nAnd so that's what you do.\n\n804\n00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,250\nSo there's a recycle bin.\n\n805\n00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,850\nNow you can have it back and\nit's ready to go.\n\n806\n00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,820\nSo just like your regular computer,\n\n807\n00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,200\nwhen you delete something,\nit simply sends it to the recycle bin.\n\n808\n00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,330\nEven though I set it permanently,\nI actually deleted it from my computer,\n\n809\n00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:40,030\nit did not permanently delete\nit from the SkyDrive here.\n\n810\n00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,835\nAnd, we are back and ready to go.\n\n811\n00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:42,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n812\n00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,450\n>> Yeah.\n>> Nice.\n\n813\n00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,081\n>> Pretty neat option.\n\n814\n00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,740\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n815\n00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:48,530\n>> Really saves you from mistakes\nthat that only I can make.\n\n816\n00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,680\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n817\n00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,250\nLike not getting a higher high score?\n\n818\n00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,005\n>> Yep, not giving a higher high score.\n\n819\n00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:53,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n820\n00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,115\nNice you know, Ronnie there's you know,\nwith the, the restore points.\n\n821\n00:34:58,115 --> 00:34:59,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There was one little button\n\n822\n00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,130\nthat\n>> Okay sure.\n\n823\n00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,790\n>> That we should touch\non that we did overlook.\n\n824\n00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,750\nAnd I'll talk a little bit.\n\n825\n00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,260\n>> No that's fine.\n\n826\n00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,560\n>> You didn't get to it.\n\n827\n00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,200\nSo we you know, on, on my PC here right,\nso I, I started up the in,\n\n828\n00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,380\nhere in the System Properties.\n\n829\n00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,370\nAnd there is this cool\nlittle button right here.\n\n830\n00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,700\nRight?\nOh yeah, so, you know,\n\n831\n00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,830\nI have you know, System Protection turned\non for the C drive and not the D drive.\n\n832\n00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,160\nNow there's this button here, configure,\nand in here you can turn on or\n\n833\n00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,700\noff the system protection.\n\n834\n00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,700\nAnd you can also select how much disk\nspace is going to be used, perhaps if,\n\n835\n00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,500\nyou know, if you have a smaller hard\ndrive, you wanted to use less space for\n\n836\n00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,146\nthose restore points.\n\n837\n00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:36,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or if you have a very large hard drive,\n\n838\n00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,510\nor perhaps you needed to have a lot\nrestore points to be able to roll back to.\n\n839\n00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,790\nYou can you know,\nallocate more space to that.\n\n840\n00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,920\nAnd you can also delete all the restore\npoints that that you currently have.\n\n841\n00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,940\nNow, yeah, there was,\nthere was one problem that I had.\n\n842\n00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,310\nIt was trying to remove some malware on,\non my PC.\n\n843\n00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:59,430\nA long time ago and\nit it was tied into the restore points.\n\n844\n00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,690\n>> Mm.\n>> And so to finally I guess,\n\n845\n00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:06,420\nas far as I know, remove the whole thing,\nI, I had to wipe out all my restore\n\n846\n00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,120\npoints, and then finally it yeah,\nit kind of cleared things up.\n\n847\n00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,960\n>> Mm.\nThere you go.\n\n848\n00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,390\n>> But, but yeah.\n\n849\n00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,060\nSo there you go.\nSo you can delete that.\n\n850\n00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,920\nRight?\n\n851\n00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,680\nSo yeah, this is for the, the D drive.\n\n852\n00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,500\n>> There ya go.\n\n853\n00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,960\n>> So yeah,\nit is turned off on the D drive.\n\n854\n00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,350\nSo we select on the system drive,\nconfigure on that current usage zero.\n\n855\n00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,180\n>> Nope.\n\n856\n00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,700\nThat's not gonna be healthy.\n\n857\n00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,590\n>> Hm.\n>> For your your restore.\n\n858\n00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,810\n>> I guess do we not\nhave any restore points?\n\n859\n00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,190\n>> I guess not\n>> So far.\n\n860\n00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,010\n>> Yeah\n>> Hm.\n\n861\n00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,930\n>> Nope Look at that.\n\n862\n00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,860\nNo restore points.\n\n863\n00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,775\n>> Huh, no restore points have\neven been created for this.\n\n864\n00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:43,102\n>> Yep.\n>> [INAUDIBLE] That's funny.\n\n865\n00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:45,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're just going to\n\n866\n00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,355\nturn that off all together.\n\n867\n00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:49,120\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n868\n00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,230\n>> I want to turn it off.\n\n869\n00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,883\nYes.\n>> So yeah.\n\n870\n00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:53,050\n>> Sweet.\n\n871\n00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:53,710\nAll right, yeah.\n\n872\n00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> There we go.\n\n873\n00:36:54,630 -->
