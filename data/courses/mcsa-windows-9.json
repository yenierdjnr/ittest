          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:05,818\n[SOUND] The 70-688 exam\n\n2\n00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:13,333\ncovers supporting Windows 8.1.\n\n3\n00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,956\nIt's the second step, and really, the,\nthe last step in obtaining your MCSA for\n\n4\n00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:18,700\nWindows 8.\n\n5\n00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,140\nNow remember the MCSA,\n\n6\n00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,550\nthat's the Microsoft Certified Solutions\nAssociate And it's designed to serve\n\n7\n00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,120\nas that, that mid level certification for\nsomebody who's going to going to be\n\n8\n00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,580\nworking with desktops in a large or\nenterprise business environment, right?\n\n9\n00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,900\nFor home users, small office,\nhome office type deployments,\n\n10\n00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,720\nthe technologies that we learn in the\nMCSA Windows 8 are usually not practical.\n\n11\n00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,250\nIt's a little bit overkill for\nsmall environments, but\n\n12\n00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,760\nif you're dealing with hundreds or\nthousands of desktops, we learn about\n\n13\n00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,800\na lot of things in the MCSA for Windows 8\nthat is very useful and very practical.\n\n14\n00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,990\nNow, keep in mind that supporting\nWindows 8.1 is the second exam.\n\n15\n00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,920\nYou should start with the first one,\nwhich is the 70-687,\n\n16\n00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,240\nand that one's gonna kind of move\nus along on the certification.\n\n17\n00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,440\nSo, let, let's take a look at\nthat track before we get too far.\n\n18\n00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,920\nThe MCSA, the Microsoft Certified\nSolutions Associate, there,\n\n19\n00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,500\nthere's actually a number of different\ntracks that are inside of there\n\n20\n00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,130\ndepending on what you want to do.\n\n21\n00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,460\nSo, for example, if you want to\nlearn about server technologies,\n\n22\n00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,870\nthey've got the MCSA for Windows Server\n2008 And Windows Server 2012.\n\n23\n00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,030\nThose focus on the server side,\nand while there is a little bit of\n\n24\n00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,880\nclient activity in there, the exams\nare really focused on the servers.\n\n25\n00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,280\nOn the desktop side, there's the MCSA for\nWindows 8 and the MCSA for Windows 7.\n\n26\n00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,260\nAnd, these again are for\nbusinesses that are being,\n\n27\n00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,980\nthat are deploying large\nquantities of Windows machines and\n\n28\n00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,570\nthey need to be able to manage,\nmaintain and support them.\n\n29\n00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,050\nNow what we're covering is the MCSA for\nWindows 8.\n\n30\n00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,188\nAnd if you dive into that,\n\n31\n00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:51,830\nyou'll see that there's basically\ntwo exams that make up that track.\n\n32\n00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,590\nThe first one is the 70-687\nthat I mentioned a moment ago.\n\n33\n00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,330\nThat's configuring Windows 8.1 and it\nfocuses on getting Windows 8 installed or\n\n34\n00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,270\ndeployed in your environment and\ngetting it up and running.\n\n35\n00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,090\nIn 688, we take that same knowledge and\n\n36\n00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,140\nnow we say how do we keep\nthings running nice and smooth?\n\n37\n00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,958\nBut its hard to keep things running\nif you didn't get them running in\n\n38\n00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:12,707\nthe first place.\n\n39\n00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,360\nSo that's why the 70-687 is first.\n\n40\n00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,385\nYou can take them out of\norder if you want, but\n\n41\n00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:21,250\nif you're learning about this,\nit doesn't make sense.\n\n42\n00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,470\nYou're taking the, the second part of\nthe exam first, but if you already have\n\n43\n00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,660\nthe knowledge it doesn't really\nmatter which order you take them in.\n\n44\n00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,510\nSo Microsoft doesn't care what\norder you do them in, but\n\n45\n00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,680\nyou typically do want\nto stay with the order.\n\n46\n00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,880\nAll right now the 688 exam is\npacked full of good information.\n\n47\n00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,500\nIt can be a little misleading though.\n\n48\n00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000\nIf we take a look at like 687,\n\n49\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,960\nand we look at its exam, it's divided\nup into seven different areas.\n\n50\n00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,910\nIf we find those down here, we'll see all\nthe different areas that are covered.\n\n51\n00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,510\nAnd they all take like 10 to 15% of\nthe exam, except for remote access and\n\n52\n00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,360\nmobility, which is 15 to 20%.\n\n53\n00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,300\nWhen we take a look at 688,\nit's a lot different.\n\n54\n00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,080\nThe 688 exam is only divided into three\nsections and each one is weighted for\n\n55\n00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,660\nabout a third of the exam.\n\n56\n00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,510\nSo it looks like a smaller exam,\nbut it is not.\n\n57\n00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,630\nEach one of these are just larger topics.\n\n58\n00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,580\nThe amount of knowledge is about the same,\nso don't underestimate it.\n\n59\n00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,810\nDon't think that this is a small and\neasy exam.\n\n60\n00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,760\nIt's actually one of the more\ndifficult exams that Microsoft has,\n\n61\n00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,050\nbecause it covers a lot of technologies\nthat people aren't familiar with.\n\n62\n00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,070\nIn Windows 8 there were a lot of new\ntroubleshooting technologies that\n\n63\n00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,720\nwere introduced.\n\n64\n00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,340\nAnd, you've gotta learn them, right?\n\n65\n00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,980\nThat's part of staying up to date.\n\n66\n00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,210\nSo if we look at each of these, the first\none is supporting operating system and\n\n67\n00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,090\napplication installation.\n\n68\n00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,210\nWell we did operating system and\ninstallation, or\n\n69\n00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,980\napplication installation, in the 70-687,\nwhy do we see this again?\n\n70\n00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,505\nWell it's supporting it,\ntroubleshooting it,\n\n71\n00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:48,255\nhandling issues that may\narise as a part of it.\n\n72\n00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:52,505\nSo this is much more of a ongoing\noperation than the original deployments we\n\n73\n00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:56,095\nsaw in the other one, and you'll see some\nof those new technologies jumping out,\n\n74\n00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:58,890\nlike user experience virtualization,\nright, UEV.\n\n75\n00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,430\nNot a lot of people have worked\nwith that because it's fairly new,\n\n76\n00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,970\nso these are some of the things that\nhave been kind of, kind of added in,\n\n77\n00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,680\nthat we've got to take the time to learn.\n\n78\n00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,730\nAnd you'll also see the Windows Store and\ncloud apps.\n\n79\n00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,520\nA lot of Internet-based technology\nis being brought into this.\n\n80\n00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,400\nSo definitely a, a different angle of, of\napproaching the same topics from 70-687.\n\n81\n00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,610\nThe second section is supporting\nresources access and so\n\n82\n00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,935\nwe start diving into some advanced things\nthat can influence sharing resources,\n\n83\n00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,195\nyou know, files, folders and printers.\n\n84\n00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:33,875\nWe'll talk about DNS security,\nways to ratchet that up, remote access,\n\n85\n00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,785\nand, and so on.\n\n86\n00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:38,980\nYou'll notice how all this is kind of\nlining up with what was in 70-687,\n\n87\n00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,960\njust going a little more advanced.\n\n88\n00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,849\nAnd then lastly we get supporting\nWindows clients and devices,\n\n89\n00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,960\nwhich is really a catch-all section.\n\n90\n00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,790\nIt goes through quite a few different\nsteps of troubleshooting and\n\n91\n00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,220\nisolating problems, and how to correct\nthem, and getting things up and going.\n\n92\n00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,130\nSo from things like, the boot manager and\nhow to analyze stop errors all the way\n\n93\n00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,440\nthrough mobile devices and\neven compliance, policy enforcement.\n\n94\n00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,740\nSo there's some really neat things there.\n\n95\n00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,480\nThis last one really starts to dabble\ninto the server side of things and\n\n96\n00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,470\nhow we can use servers to\nmanage those Windows 8 clients.\n\n97\n00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,800\nSo it really does serve as that\nbridge into Windows Server 2012.\n\n98\n00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,335\nThere is also a,\na section on Windows Intune which is a,\n\n99\n00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:28,120\na cloud based management solution that\nnot a lot of people have worked with.\n\n100\n00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,256\nWell it's on the exam.\n\n101\n00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,849\nYou need to get exposed to it and\nunderstand it, if for\n\n102\n00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:35,951\nno other reason then to determine whether\nor not it's right for your organization.\n\n103\n00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:39,580\nAll right?\nSo the 70-688, it covers a lot of stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,690\nIt is a, a big exam and\nit's a lot of new stuff for people,\n\n105\n00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,470\neven if you were certified\nunder Windows 7.\n\n106\n00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,750\nThere's just a lot of new things\nthat have been added since then.\n\n107\n00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,850\nSo it is, a bit of a challenge.\n\n108\n00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,400\nRight?\n\n109\n00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,950\nYou gotta hit the books and study hard,\n\n110\n00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,690\nand make sure you learn each of\nthe concepts that are in there.\n\n111\n00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,710\nAnd that's what our show's\ndesigned to help with.\n\n112\n00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,740\nSo in our 70-688 show, we take all of\nthose topics and we break them down into\n\n113\n00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,040\nepisodes that we can cover it and\nmake sure that you understand\n\n114\n00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,930\nthe technologies and are able to\nimplement those successfully on the exam.\n\n115\n00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,090\nNow the 70-688 exam is just like\nevery other Microsoft exam.\n\n116\n00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,140\nIt's a hundred and\nfifty dollars to take it and\n\n117\n00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,940\nyou take it at\na Pearson VUE Testing Center.\n\n118\n00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,360\nPearson VUE has centers\nall over the world, so\n\n119\n00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,680\nyou can likely find one very close to you.\n\n120\n00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,550\nYou can go to their website,\nit's www.pearsonvue.com, that's V-U-E,\n\n121\n00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,140\nand if you add a slash Microsoft to the\nend you will go right to Microsoft's page,\n\n122\n00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,620\nyou are going to locate a testing center\nnear you and sign up and take the exam.\n\n123\n00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,982\nWhen you successfully\npass both the 70-687 and\n\n124\n00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:45,160\n70-688 exam,\nyou'll be awarded the MCSA Windows 8.\n\n125\n00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,660\nIt's a great certification to have.\n\n126\n00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,850\nIt shows employers that you understand\nhow to deploy and maintain Windows 8 and,\n\n127\n00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,380\nit gets you prepared to be ready for the\nnext version of Windows that comes out.\n\n128\n00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,980\nSo when Windows 10 comes out,\n\n129\n00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,780\nyou've already learned the bulk of\nwhat's gonna be on those exams too.\n\n130\n00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,460\nSo it is a great certification.\n\n131\n00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,100\nReally kinda pushes you along\nin a general direction.\n\n132\n00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,080\nNow if you're just getting\nstarted out in IT,\n\n133\n00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,760\nthe MCSA is not really a starting\nout certification, so for you,\n\n134\n00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,770\nyou might wanna start with, CompTIA A+ if\nyou've already got computer knowledge.\n\n135\n00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,620\nIf you don't have computer knowledge\nyou might want to start with CompTIA IT\n\n136\n00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,700\nFundamentals or the Microsoft Technology\nAssociation, the MTA certification.\n\n137\n00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,100\nIn there we start with Windows\n7 at a basic level and\n\n138\n00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,870\ncover things like installations and\nbasic support.\n\n139\n00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,190\nNot very high level.\n\n140\n00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,260\nIf you've got even, even a handful\nof months of experience working with\n\n141\n00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,110\ncomputers you might find the MTA content\na little bit, I'm going to say, boring.\n\n142\n00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,670\nIt's not that it's boring, it's just\nthat you already know the content.\n\n143\n00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,210\nRight?\n\n144\n00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,092\nSo, for you, you move up,\nyou go into the MCSA.\n\n145\n00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:46,370\nAll right?\n\n146\n00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,910\nNow what many people chose to do is to\ndo the MCSA for Windows 8 as a client.\n\n147\n00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,980\nAnd then also do the MCSA for\nWindows Server.\n\n148\n00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,440\nAnd that's a great idea because\nyou get the best of both worlds.\n\n149\n00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,980\nAnd by understanding the server and\n\n150\n00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,780\nclient technologies you can integrate\nthem better in a workplace.\n\n151\n00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,690\nSo that makes you a more\nvaluable employee.\n\n152\n00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,890\nNot just to your company, but\nto your coworkers, right?\n\n153\n00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,650\nYou can.\n\n154\n00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,110\nProperly deploy solutions that\nare effective and stay running, and\n\n155\n00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,620\nthat's really the goal\nof an IT technician.\n\n156\n00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,780\nAll right, so,\nif that sounds exciting to you,\n\n157\n00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,860\nsounds like what you want to learn,\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n158\n00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,250\nStay tuned, our episodes for\n70-688 are starting here in just a moment.\n\n159\n00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,330\nif this is the wrong place for\nyou, you know, it's no big deal.\n\n160\n00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,150\nJump over to one of the other\ncertifications that I suggested.\n\n161\n00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,290\nFor the server side, you're looking for\nthe MCSA Windows Server so\n\n162\n00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,300\nthose start with the 70-410 exam so\nyou wanna go and find that show.\n\n163\n00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,890\nIf you're starting out\na little more basic than this,\n\n164\n00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,970\nthen you want to check out the CompTIA A+\nif you have some experience, or\n\n165\n00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,510\nthe CompTIA IT Fundamentals\nif you have no experience.\n\n166\n00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,850\nAnd, if you want to stick with\nMicrosoft there's the MTA,\n\n167\n00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,390\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate\nwhich again, if you have no experience,\n\n168\n00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,010\ngreat place to start.\n\n169\n00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,180\nBut if you're looking for desktops,\nthen it's MCSA Windows 8 all the way.\n\n170\n00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,829\nSo let's go ahead and get started, and,\nif I don't see you before your exam,\n\n171\n00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:02,542\ngood luck.\n\n172\n00:09:02,542 -->

00:00:35,296\nGood morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:35,961\nWelcome back.\n\n6\n00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:38,766\nTo another episode of ITPro TV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\n\n7\n00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,440\ntoday with Mister Nate Copeland.\n\n8\n00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,160\nHow's it going, Nate?\n\n9\n00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,920\n>> Yay.\nPretty good Don.\n\n10\n00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,670\nHow are you today?\n\n11\n00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,628\n>> I am doing just swell.\n\n12\n00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,448\nFor our proud American viewers,\n\n13\n00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:50,878\nI think most everybody here in the US is\naware that the Superbowl is this weekend.\n\n14\n00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:51,712\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n15\n00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,295\n>> Right?\n\n16\n00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,836\nPumped up for the Superbowl.\n\n17\n00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:58,092\nMy team of choice is of\ncourse the Seattle Sea Hawks,\n\n18\n00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:01,510\nwho are a miserable miserable team.\n\n19\n00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,530\nBut I've stuck by them through the years,\nbut it's so hard after being\n\n20\n00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,210\nbeaten down all these years to have\nhope that the Superbowl is in our grasp.\n\n21\n00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,930\nBut anyhow we're having\na Seattle Sea Hawks day.\n\n22\n00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,525\nAnd by we I just mean me.\n\n23\n00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:16,270\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n24\n00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,480\nIf you would've communicated beforehand\nthen I could have gotten something to go\n\n25\n00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,160\nin my corner in which there is nothing.\n\n26\n00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,385\nBut if I did have to choose though I am\ngoing with Seattle for the Superbowl.\n\n27\n00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not, well,\n\n28\n00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,700\nokay, I'm not betting on it.\n\n29\n00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,480\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> I'm not out any money.\n\n30\n00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,130\nBut when they score I'll cheer louder for\nSeattle.\n\n31\n00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,420\n>> Yeah, well meanwhile our European and\noverseas viewers are all saying,\n\n32\n00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,822\nwhy are they using their hands\nwhen they're playing football?\n\n33\n00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:44,334\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:45,790\n>> So moving on.\n\n35\n00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,400\nWe've got a Windows 8 episode up today.\n\n36\n00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,270\nNow, if this is your very\nfirst Windows 8 70-688 exam\n\n37\n00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,330\nepisode that you've watched with ITProTV,\n\n38\n00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,330\nthen nothing is strange other than\nmy shirt and the flag behind me.\n\n39\n00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,900\nBut if you've been watching all along, you\nmight have noticed that when you went to\n\n40\n00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,860\nour exam objectives page,\nall the links to the videos were gone, and\n\n41\n00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,410\nthat they were kind of moved way\ndown on the bottom of the page.\n\n42\n00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,700\nAnd what happened is,\nas of January 2014, Microsoft finally.\n\n43\n00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,615\nOfficially updated the exam\nobjectives to reflect Windows 8.1.\n\n44\n00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:25,660\nNow we've been using Windows 8.1 in\nevery one of our episodes already so\n\n45\n00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,480\nwe were already prepared for that.\n\n46\n00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,070\nAnd in the other shows like\nthe 687 Show or whatever,\n\n47\n00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,946\nwe just had to add a few new episodes to\ncover some of the new content they added.\n\n48\n00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:41,700\nBut the 70-688 exam,\nI mean it is a total overhaul.\n\n49\n00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,650\nThey completely changed the objectives and\n\n50\n00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,610\nit really doesn't even\nreflect the old exam at all.\n\n51\n00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,040\nSo we have to take a wash,\nwe just have to throw it out,\n\n52\n00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,230\nthrow out all the other episodes,\nand we didn't throw them out,\n\n53\n00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,760\nthey're good episodes, they teach a lot,\nit's valuable information, so\n\n54\n00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,230\nwe saved them, but we just kinda\nmoved them to the bottom of the page,\n\n55\n00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,030\nbrought in all of these new objectives,\nand we're starting over.\n\n56\n00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,355\nStarting over on day one and\n\n57\n00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:06,820\njumping through the newest\nWindows 8.1 70-688 exam topics.\n\n58\n00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,060\n>> Yep.\nNow specifically, Don.\n\n59\n00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,470\nSo today we're gonna\nget into Windows to go.\n\n60\n00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,920\nWe've got WinPE.\n\n61\n00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,880\nWe've got managing images.\n\n62\n00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,450\nAnd it's good that we're\ncovering all these objectives.\n\n63\n00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,080\nAnd you got the official ones?\n\n64\n00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,450\n>> Yeah, here,\nlet me just pull it up here.\n\n65\n00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,650\nSo let's see, there we go.\n\n66\n00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,360\nHere we've got the exam objectives for\n70-688.\n\n67\n00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,790\nAnd the very first objective is\nsupporting operating systems and\n\n68\n00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,150\napplication installation.\n\n69\n00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,190\nSo we're tackling Windows\ninstallations here, right?\n\n70\n00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,290\nAnd some of these, like Windows to go.\n\n71\n00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,550\nWe did tackle on the 7687 show.\n\n72\n00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,510\nBut we're going to talk about them again\nhere from a supporting stand point.\n\n73\n00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,520\nRight?\nSo this may not be the first time you've\n\n74\n00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,110\nseen it, but\n\n75\n00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,940\njust some of the additional concepts we\nneed to be aware of in supporting it.\n\n76\n00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,570\nAnd those other objectives I mentioned,\n\n77\n00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,520\nif you scroll down here past all the new\nobjectives, this is all the new stuff,\n\n78\n00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,740\nway down here we've got oh,\nhere is the old stuff right here.\n\n79\n00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,570\nSo here's all the other ones\nthat we had filmed prior\n\n80\n00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,740\ncovering the various concepts that we need\nto be aware of, but so those are good.\n\n81\n00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,050\nYou can watch them, but\nif you haven't, don't worry about it.\n\n82\n00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,830\nWe're going to move through so,\nwe'll start with Windows to go.\n\n83\n00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,680\nWe're also going to tackle VHD in\nmulti-boot which is pretty cool.\n\n84\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,210\nWe, what, I think we both use\nthose every day, don't we?\n\n85\n00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,020\nAnd then we've got desktop images.\n\n86\n00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,680\nHow we can clone machines and you know,\nmake deployments much much faster.\n\n87\n00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,850\nAnd lastly we'll take\na look at Windows PE,\n\n88\n00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,275\nthe scaled down portable edition of\nWindows which is pretty neato mosquito.\n\n89\n00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:39,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n90\n00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,939\n>> To use the technical term.\n\n91\n00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,000\nIt is, it's official.\n\n92\n00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,740\n>> Right?\n\n93\n00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,930\nThe things that you say on here,\nI don't get it.\n\n94\n00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,400\n>> You never know.\n\n95\n00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,480\n>> But yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,160\nAll right, so what do you say we just\nkick this thing of with one of those,\n\n97\n00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,210\nwell I guess there are some\nnew things to Windows 8.\n\n98\n00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,370\nSo, we do kinda wash things and\nWindows 8.1 does bring\n\n99\n00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,590\nforth a wealth of new feature and\ncool things that it can do.\n\n100\n00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,440\nI believe though in the 687 we'll\nget a little bit more into what\n\n101\n00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,940\nwhat they are and how to use them and\nfiguring stuff like that and\n\n102\n00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,100\nwe'll touch of few of the stuff in here.\n\n103\n00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,920\n>> Just in case this is\nsomebody's first episode, right?\n\n104\n00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,350\nWhich it shouldn't be you should start\nin 7687 but just in case Windows to go,\n\n105\n00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,150\nif this is the first\ntime you've heard of it.\n\n106\n00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,600\nNormally when we install Windows,\n\n107\n00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,380\nwe're installing it to the hard drive\ninside of our PC or laptop, right?\n\n108\n00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,230\nAnd then, if we travel, if I'm\ntraveling around the world or whatever,\n\n109\n00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,110\nI need to take my laptop with me.\n\n110\n00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,020\nBut sometimes I don't have that available.\n\n111\n00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,840\nIt's kinda difficult to\ntote a laptop around,\n\n112\n00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,380\nespecially internationally these days,\nvarious rules that you have in airports.\n\n113\n00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:56,460\nSo it can be more convenient, instead,\nto install Windows to a removable media,\n\n114\n00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,380\nto a USB thumb drive or a USB hard drive.\n\n115\n00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,470\nAnd you can tote around a fully installed\nversion of Windows right on the USB drive.\n\n116\n00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,040\nYou walk up to a computer.\n\n117\n00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,090\nYou plug it into the USB\nports on the computer,\n\n118\n00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,830\nand you boot from your drive instead of\nthe drive inside of the computer, and now\n\n119\n00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,000\nyou're running your own copy of Windows on\nany hardware that you find as you travel.\n\n120\n00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,570\nSo instead of carrying a full laptop,\nyou're just carrying a little drive.\n\n121\n00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,250\nAnd employees can bring\ntheir own laptops to work,\n\n122\n00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,700\nboot off of their assigned corporate key,\nthey boot it up off of that USB key, or\n\n123\n00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,410\nthumb drive, and then now they're running\nthe corporate OS on their own hardware.\n\n124\n00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,405\nKinda supports that whole bring your\nown device, or BYOD environment.\n\n125\n00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:38,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n126\n00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:44,825\nYeah, as far as Windows to go, goes\nthat there are a few things with those.\n\n127\n00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:52,680\nNow there are certified Windows to go\nUSB devices that Microsoft recommends.\n\n128\n00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,480\nNow I've you know, so\nI have a USB 3.0 cradle here with just\n\n129\n00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,842\na 2.5 millimeter hard drive in there,\nlaptop drive.\n\n130\n00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:05,765\n>> 2.5 millimeter, that's pretty small.\n\n131\n00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:07,313\n>> 2.5, 2.5 inches.\n\n132\n00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:10,510\n>> [LAUGH] I was going to say\nthat's an advanced driver in there,\n\n133\n00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,050\na 2.5 millimeters, holy.\n\n134\n00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,120\n>> So just a laptop drive sitting in\nthe sky so I'm running windows to go and\n\n135\n00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,790\nit isn't a certified USB or\nwindows to go drive.\n\n136\n00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,000\nNow there are some things\nthat it does have to go by.\n\n137\n00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,940\nYou cannot install Window\nto go to a USB 2.0 drive.\n\n138\n00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,750\nIt has to be USB 3.0.\n\n139\n00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,900\nNow it can operate on a USB 2.0 port, but\nit just can't put it on a USB 2.0 drive.\n\n140\n00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,518\nNow, Don I'm gonna throw this out there,\nso why do you think it has to be 3.0.\n\n141\n00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:46,590\n>> Well,\nactually let me just throw in here.\n\n142\n00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,580\nYou actually can install with a 2.0 but\nMicrosoft won't support it.\n\n143\n00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,930\nSo Microsoft wants you in 3.0 and\nthe main reason is performance.\n\n144\n00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,529\nSo Nate has this really fancy\nUSB 3.0 cradle right here.\n\n145\n00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,137\nI'm a tightwad and\nI don't like to spend money and so\n\n146\n00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:04,928\nI've got a USB 2.0 cradle over here.\n\n147\n00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:09,909\nAnd I did install Windows To Go\non it just to see if I could, and\n\n148\n00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:12,080\nI could and it ran so slow.\n\n149\n00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,940\nIt took the computer a good\n15 minutes just to boot up.\n\n150\n00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,440\nThat's a long time just to boot up.\n\n151\n00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,430\nThe install took well over an hour.\n\n152\n00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,360\nSo it's just, from a performance\nstandpoint it's a nightmare.\n\n153\n00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,701\nIs there something other than\nperformance or is that the main thing?\n\n154\n00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,910\n>> No, that's it.\n\n155\n00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:36,320\nYeah, they just run so slow that it's\nreally not productive, productivity.\n\n156\n00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,340\n>> And the difference between USB 2.0 and\n3.0 is like night and day.\n\n157\n00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,000\nI mean, it is a huge difference.\n\n158\n00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,355\nSo I watch sometimes when Nate\nruns it off of his hard drive and\n\n159\n00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:47,320\nit's just going nice and snappy.\n\n160\n00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,490\nAnd then I got mine, it's really slow.\n\n161\n00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,190\nSo yeah.\nSo that's a big reason right there,\n\n162\n00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,840\nthat's really what the Microsoft\nauthorized hardware is all about.\n\n163\n00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,030\nWhen they say this is a Microsoft\napproved, Windows To Go approved piece of\n\n164\n00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,620\nhardware, that means that it met their\ntests for speed and reliability.\n\n165\n00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,860\nCuz you got speed of the port, but\n\n166\n00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,410\nyou also have the speed of\nthe memory that's on it.\n\n167\n00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,400\nSo you'll see well, with USB flash\ndrives and flash memory in general,\n\n168\n00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,980\nyou'll see we have class ten micro SD\ncards versus class two micro SD cards.\n\n169\n00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,010\nAnd if you try and run this off something\nlike class two it's terrible, but\n\n170\n00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,370\nclass ten is acceptable.\n\n171\n00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,050\nSo you got various speed\nrates on the memory, too.\n\n172\n00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,520\nIf you don't know all that stuff,\nthen you just look for the Microsoft logo.\n\n173\n00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,878\nThis is Windows To Go approved.\n\n174\n00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:33,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n175\n00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:39,240\nNow, as far as supporting these guys,\nonce you boot up on these guys,\n\n176\n00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,440\nit's just like running off the bare metal,\nmore or less.\n\n177\n00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,835\nYou can still join it to the domain,\nit can still take a group policy,\n\n178\n00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:54,590\nit can use direct access and\nother VPN things to connect.\n\n179\n00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,750\nIt's just running off of a USB device.\n\n180\n00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n181\n00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,780\nSome of the concerns we have,\nbecause you know,\n\n182\n00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,020\ntechnically this objective is\nsupporting Windows To Go, right?\n\n183\n00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,740\nSo we've already seen installing it, we've\nalready seen running it, so supporting it.\n\n184\n00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,880\nWe make sure we use the right hardware,\nthat's gonna be a big thing.\n\n185\n00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,590\nThe other thing is we need to understand\nthe different characteristics of Windows.\n\n186\n00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,530\nSo when Windows is running on\nyour laptop or your desktop,\n\n187\n00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,530\nespecially if it's your desktop,\nit's probably running all the time.\n\n188\n00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,550\nAnd you have things like Windows\nupdates that are set to occur,\n\n189\n00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,500\nwell the default is every morning at 3 AM,\nright?\n\n190\n00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,970\nIt checks for updates.\n\n191\n00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,598\nWell, if you're running Windows To Go\noff of a USB drive, it's probably\n\n192\n00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:36,392\ndisconnected far more commonly than\na laptop or desktop normally would be.\n\n193\n00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:40,734\nSo that means your device maybe\noffline for long periods of time.\n\n194\n00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:43,370\nAll right now, we need to be\naware of that, because there's\n\n195\n00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,950\na couple of interesting things that happen\nif your machine is turned off too long.\n\n196\n00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,170\nOne big difference is, well,\nthose Windows updates.\n\n197\n00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,810\nIf it's not doing its Windows updates,\nif I don't plug that disc in for\n\n198\n00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,070\na week,\nnow I'm a week behind in my updates.\n\n199\n00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,680\nSo if I only use it when I travel,\nI do have a risky machine now.\n\n200\n00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,693\nSo I go and I travel and\nI plug in this drive and\n\n201\n00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:06,015\nI boot off it that hasn't\nbeen updated in a month.\n\n202\n00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,720\nRight?\nNow I've got a big problem there cuz I\n\n203\n00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,710\nam vulnerable.\n\n204\n00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,538\nSo we need to make sure that these\nWindow's To Go devices are being booted\n\n205\n00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,111\nregularly, just so\nthey can do their updates and\n\n206\n00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:19,523\nmake sure that they're secure and\nthat they've been patched.\n\n207\n00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:24,990\n>> And something else to go along with\nthat, as far as deployment considerations.\n\n208\n00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,010\nSo if you do have some devices\nthat aren't booting up\n\n209\n00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,190\nfrequently enough that it is\npossible that these device can,\n\n210\n00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,750\nthat their records,\ntheir computer accounts could go stale.\n\n211\n00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,800\nThey could be pruned.\n\n212\n00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,590\nAnd so it would be,\nit'd stick them in their own OU.\n\n213\n00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,520\n>> I didn't even think about that\nin the active directory, yeah,\n\n214\n00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,100\nthat was a good one.\n\n215\n00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,570\n>> Oh, thank you.\n>> In the active directory if your Windows\n\n216\n00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,160\nTo Go machine is joined to your domain,\nwhich 99% of the time it's going to be.\n\n217\n00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,920\nIf that machine is offline for\na long period of time, its password, and\n\n218\n00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,840\nI'm talking about the machine\npassword not the user password,\n\n219\n00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,880\nthe machine password can become out of\nsync with what's in the active directory\n\n220\n00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,500\ncausing the domain trust to break.\n\n221\n00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,200\nNow you want that.\n\n222\n00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,550\nIf the drive got lost or\n\n223\n00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,840\nstolen you don't want that to be\na valid machine forever and ever.\n\n224\n00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,950\nBut if it is a valid machine,\nit just isn't turned on for a long time,\n\n225\n00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,270\nthen that trust relationship\nwith the domain will break.\n\n226\n00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,674\nAnd there are ways to fix that, but\n\n227\n00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:21,530\nthe best thing to do is to not\nhave it happen in the first place.\n\n228\n00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:27,102\nSo when you assign a Windows To Go drive\nto someone you need to let them know,\n\n229\n00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:31,878\nhey, you've got to boot this at\nleast once a week or whatever and\n\n230\n00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:36,849\nconnect into the office,\nmake sure the updates occur, and so on.\n\n231\n00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,635\nThink of it as like a potted plant, right.\n\n232\n00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,235\nIt's not like a cactus where you\njust stick it on the windowsill and\n\n233\n00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:41,937\nforget about it.\n\n234\n00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,815\nIt's more like a African Violet.\n\n235\n00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:46,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm having a hard time thinking of\n\n236\n00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,850\nhouse plants.\n\n237\n00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,835\nIt was a terrible example.\n\n238\n00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:50,670\nBut you gotta water it, you gotta tend it.\n\n239\n00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,870\nThat's how Windows To Go is, right?\n\n240\n00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can't just set it and\n\n241\n00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,185\nforget it like a rotisserie chicken.\n\n242\n00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:57,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You gotta sing to it, talk to it.\n\n243\n00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,817\n>> Sing to it, yeah.\n\n244\n00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,525\n[LAUGH]\n>> With those plants.\n\n245\n00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:03,490\n>> I talk to my Windows, but\nit's not singing, that's for sure.\n\n246\n00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,775\n[LAUGH]\n>> The window plants.\n\n247\n00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:07,445\n>> I meant Windows,\n\n248\n00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:08,465\nthe operating system, but-\n\n249\n00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:09,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Same thing.\n\n250\n00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,610\nIt gets confusing, doesn't it.\n\n251\n00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,953\n>> Yeah, man.\n>> Shouldn't be called Windows,\n\n252\n00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:13,077\nshould've called it something else.\n\n253\n00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:14,529\nThey should have called it Vista.\n\n254\n00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:17,477\n[LAUGH].\n\n255\n00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:21,453\nAll right, so Windows to go supporting it,\nthose are some of the big things.\n\n256\n00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:23,672\nRight?\nYou want to use the right hardware.\n\n257\n00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:26,710\nYou wanna make sure the machines are being\nbrought online and kept healthy and\n\n258\n00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,550\nkept active.\n\n259\n00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,190\nIf you're really concerned about that,\n\n260\n00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,720\nthose machines not being\nlaunched on regular intervals,\n\n261\n00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,090\nyou should really consider deploying\nNetwork Access Protection, NAP.\n\n262\n00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,010\nWindows NAP, which allows when\na machine VPNs in or connects in,\n\n263\n00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,240\nlike Windows To Go is normally going\nto do, it can check the machine and\n\n264\n00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,646\nsay have you done your updates,\nhave you done your antivirus updates,\n\n265\n00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:48,640\nhave you ran a virus scan recently.\n\n266\n00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,640\nAnd if you haven't, it will quarantine\nthe machine, help it get corrected.\n\n267\n00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,090\nIt does what they call remediation\nwhere it will bring it up to date, and\n\n268\n00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,836\nso on,\nbefore allowing it onto the network.\n\n269\n00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:03,920\nAnd if you're gonna be deploying\nWindows To Go in a corporate environment,\n\n270\n00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,190\nthat really is a must.\n\n271\n00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,360\nYou really need to have that.\n\n272\n00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,590\nIf you're just doing it to goof off\nat home, Windows To Go like we do,\n\n273\n00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,200\nthen maybe you don't worry about it so\nmuch.\n\n274\n00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,738\nBut in a corporate environment\nyou're gonna need that.\n\n275\n00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:15,970\nAnd that leads me to\nanother point to mention.\n\n276\n00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,980\nIf you want to use Windows To Go,\n\n277\n00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,820\nyou've got to have Windows\n8.1 Enterprise edition.\n\n278\n00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,270\nIt doesn't work with Windows 8.1 Pro or\nWindows 8.1 Home or\n\n279\n00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,470\nwhatever edition, or\nit's just standard, not Home.\n\n280\n00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,190\nSo Standard or Pro,\ndoesn't work with those guys.\n\n281\n00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,020\nYou gotta have Enterprise.\n\n282\n00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,050\nAnd you can't buy Enterprise, you can't\ngo to the store and buy it off the shelf.\n\n283\n00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,230\nYou have to have a volume license\nagreement with Microsoft.\n\n284\n00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,050\nSo the only people who have Windows\n8.1 Enterprise are enterprises.\n\n285\n00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,940\nCompanies with hundreds or more computers,\notherwise they're not gonna have it,\n\n286\n00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,170\nWindows To Go is not even an option then,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n287\n00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,390\n>> Yeah, and you know, Don,\nI was reading about that and\n\n288\n00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,170\nthe reason for that Enterprise,\nwell, one of the many reasons for\n\n289\n00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,930\nthat, is that since you'd\nuse a volume license key.\n\n290\n00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,360\nSo it kind of falls into\nthe licensing part of things,\n\n291\n00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,890\nto where you'd have your Windows To Go\ndevice that is booting on\n\n292\n00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,720\ndifferent hardware all the time and\nroaming about.\n\n293\n00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,740\nIt doesn't see it as a brand new machine,\nit knows it's a portable guy.\n\n294\n00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,760\nAnd you don't run into those\ntypes of licensing issues.\n\n295\n00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,678\n>> That's a good point.\nWith Pro and\n\n296\n00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:22,870\nStandard if they see different hardware,\nif they see a different motherboard they\n\n297\n00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,400\nmake you reactivate and\nyou'd burn through you're activations.\n\n298\n00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,990\nWith a regular consumer or\nOEM product key,\n\n299\n00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,540\nI think you get like five activations\nwith it before they red flag it and\n\n300\n00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,310\nthen if you try and activate again,\nyou got to call them on the phone.\n\n301\n00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,260\nSo that would happen every time you\nplugged into a new computer with that, so\n\n302\n00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,175\nthat would be a hassle.\n\n303\n00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:41,900\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah, and\n\n304\n00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,650\nyou know what, as a matter of fact, if\nwe could pull up my machine right quick.\n\n305\n00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,300\nI'll show you something,\nDon, as it comes up.\n\n306\n00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,770\n>> Is it gonna be exciting?\n\n307\n00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,598\n>> No, I don't know, I don't think so.\n\n308\n00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:56,334\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But here is my machine here and\n\n309\n00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:00,277\njust like any other Windows\ninstallation drive.\n\n310\n00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:04,642\nGot all my cool stuff here and\naccess to my windows store and\n\n311\n00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:08,040\nwhat not, and you know it's pretty snappy.\n\n312\n00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,580\nAnd I can things it up and I can brows\nthe internet and things come up.\n\n313\n00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,880\nAnd for this show Don I'm actually\nrunning off of Windows to go.\n\n314\n00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,760\n>> Oh you're running it right now.\n\n315\n00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,280\nOh that's cool.\n\n316\n00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,330\n>> Before I was like Don\ndon't jostle that hard drive\n\n317\n00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,090\n>> I'm running off of it.\n\n318\n00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,690\n>> I thought you were just being paranoid.\n\n319\n00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,090\nI was ready to jostle the hard drive.\n\n320\n00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,844\n>> No, no.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n321\n00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,450\n>> But yes, and so for this show, for\n\n322\n00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,110\neverything, the screencasting and\n\n323\n00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,010\nto do Windows PE here towards the end\n>> Running everything off this\n\n324\n00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:45,540\nWindows to go I can even run\nHyperV off of it, as well and\n\n325\n00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,130\nhost virtual machines off of\na Windows to go device here.\n\n326\n00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,080\n>> See, now that's where it\ngets really slick because\n\n327\n00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,110\naside from running on a USB device,\nafter that it is a-.\n\n328\n00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,580\n>> Full version of Windows.\n\n329\n00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,410\nIt's not like some crippled or\nwhatever edition.\n\n330\n00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,010\nIt is a full on edition.\n\n331\n00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,580\nSo once you boot up, you work like normal.\n\n332\n00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,910\nYou can add other USB devices,\nplug in your webcam, stuff like that.\n\n333\n00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,000\nIt all works just fine.\n\n334\n00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,940\nThe only difference is that the hard\ndrive is sticking outside of the computer\n\n335\n00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,170\ninstead of inside.\n\n336\n00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,985\nYou know the rest of it just runs nice and\nsmooth.\n\n337\n00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:19,700\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n338\n00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,540\nAnd it's also bit locker\nencrypted as well.\n\n339\n00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,880\nSo if I do lose this for some reason,\nof course it's just a stripped down\n\n340\n00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,640\neval edition running, but yeah,\nright there on the little-.\n\n341\n00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,510\n>> You know, icon there,\nyou see the lock on there, so\n\n342\n00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,790\nit is BitLocker encrypted, and\nif I was travelling overseas or\n\n343\n00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,020\nsomething, and\nthe device is lost or whatnot.\n\n344\n00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,540\n>> It is secured so\nif anything were to go wrong, yeah.\n\n345\n00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,280\nThen they would,\nmy company's direct access connection.\n\n346\n00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,200\nPeople wouldn't be able to exploit that.\n\n347\n00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,360\n>> Yeah and that's the important thing.\n\n348\n00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,220\nIt's a portable copy of Windows so they\nexpect you to be using this in hotels,\n\n349\n00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,790\nconference centers, places where you\nare on rented, untrusted computers.\n\n350\n00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,600\nSo you need to bring up a secure OS, you\nmore than likely will have a VPN client\n\n351\n00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,720\ninstalled inside of it, or use direct\naccess or a technology like that.\n\n352\n00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,490\nSo that when you fire up this device,\nyou're effectively on your corporate\n\n353\n00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,360\nnetwork, even though you're remote, and\nif somebody were to get a hold of that,\n\n354\n00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,740\nsomebody outside,\nthat would be a big deal.\n\n355\n00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,520\n>> And that does bring up a point, Ronnie,\nabout Using it on untrusted computers.\n\n356\n00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,590\nYou know, when you do plug in,\nlet's say you have a running computer and\n\n357\n00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,870\nyou plug in your USB to go drive.\n\n358\n00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,510\nWindows will not recognize it.\n\n359\n00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,020\nIt will not pop up, so that it doesn't,\nyou know, it doesn't start to assign drive\n\n360\n00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,110\nletters and mess up, you know,\nthose partitions on there.\n\n361\n00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,500\nBut you can access it on there.\n\n362\n00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,300\nYou can use Diskpart to go in there and\nassign it a drive letter.\n\n363\n00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,510\nAnd be able to access the device.\n\n364\n00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,560\nNow, when running off of\na Windows to go device\n\n365\n00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,000\nthe host computer's internal\ndrives are offline.\n\n366\n00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,315\nYou can not access them.\n\n367\n00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:56,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now, you can however go in there.\n\n368\n00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,140\nYou can fire up disc management and\ngo in there and\n\n369\n00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,300\nthen mount those internal drives.\n\n370\n00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,930\n>> And still use them.\n\n371\n00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,810\nAnd so if there is a computer that\nis really untrusted computer,\n\n372\n00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,590\nWindows To Go is still\nsusceptible to malware attacks.\n\n373\n00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,890\nIt can mount itself,\nit can jump on there, it is possible.\n\n374\n00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,480\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n375\n00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,600\nyeah-\n>> Well,\n\n376\n00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,490\nthat's why the internal hard drives are\nnot mounted by default, because, you know,\n\n377\n00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,750\nlike if you're at if a Kinko's or\nsomewhere you can rent a computer,\n\n378\n00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,400\nthen you don't know who else\nhas used the computer, and\n\n379\n00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,390\nif they've installed key loggers or\nwhatever.\n\n380\n00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,550\n>> And so when you boot up off that disk,\nit's just gonna show your disk,\n\n381\n00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:41,108\nthe other ones it doesn't even mount so\nany active malware won't be able to load.\n\n382\n00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:42,579\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n383\n00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:46,374\n>> Well, Nate, that's about all I've\ngot on Windows to go, do you have a-.\n\n384\n00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:47,804\n>> Anything else?\n\n385\n00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:50,748\n>> No.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n386\n00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:51,310\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n387\n00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,490\n>> Yeah, it just.\n\n388\n00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,090\nNo, that was it.\n\n389\n00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,830\n>> It's one of the cooler things to come\nout of Windows 8, and it was in Windows 8.\n\n390\n00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,590\nIt's not a Windows 8.1 thing.\n\n391\n00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,680\nBut it is one of the cooler\nthings to come out.\n\n392\n00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,560\n>> It is a very powerful utility and\n\n393\n00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,630\nit's a heck of a lot easier\nthan carrying around a laptop.\n\n394\n00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,300\nYou can have like a 64 gig USB key that's\non you key chain, you know, and have it\n\n395\n00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,140\nwhere you can walk around and you've got\nbasically a whole computer right there.\n\n396\n00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,240\nYou just need to find a shell,\n\n397\n00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,445\nsome hardware to borrow while you boot\nit up and do what you need to do.\n\n398\n00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n399\n00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:24,930\nYep.\n\n400\n00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,740\n>> Alright, well the next thing on our\nagenda is managing boot settings including\n\n401\n00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,450\nnative VHD and multi-boot.\n\n402\n00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,260\nVHD boot is Kind of like\nWindows to go in a way.\n\n403\n00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,120\nSo we're gonna take a look at that,\nI really like this technology,\n\n404\n00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,410\nwhen it came out in Windows 7,\nI was really excited about it.\n\n405\n00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,570\nI started using it back then,\nI still use it today, and\n\n406\n00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,110\nI've found just a number of uses for it.\n\n407\n00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,520\nSo really cool stuff, but You know we're\na little ahead of schedule I guess,\n\n408\n00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,670\nso lets do this, Nale.\n\n409\n00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,260\nLet's stop here and take a break.\n\n410\n00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,120\nAnd when we get back,\nwe can jump into that one so\n\n411\n00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,230\nthat we don't have to just take\na break after we get started, so.\n\n412\n00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,060\n>> The boot settings?\n\n413\n00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,280\n>> Yeah, boot from VHD and\nMulti boot and all that good stuff, so.\n\n414\n00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,030\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n415\n00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,690\nAll right.\nSo ladies and gentleman stay tuned.\n\n416\n00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,241\nWhen we get back,\nmore boot stuff after this.\n\n417\n00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:12,839\n[MUSIC]\n\n418\n00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:18,164\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n419\n00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:21,761\nSo now what I wanna do is I wanna\nchange gears a little bit and\n\n420\n00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:27,055\ntake a look at installations of Windows\n8.1 that are done to our local hard drive.\n\n421\n00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:30,045\nRight?\nTo right here on our own system and\n\n422\n00:21:30,045 --> 00:21:32,035\nsome of the things we might\nneed to tweak with them.\n\n423\n00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:35,140\nNow Installing the OS we've already\nseen that, that's not exciting.\n\n424\n00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,178\nYou boot off a disk, you click next 15\ntime and pow you're running Windows.\n\n425\n00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,025\nSo.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n426\n00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:42,610\n>> I might of oversimplified.\n\n427\n00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,800\nBut it's not 15 it's like ten times but\nstill.\n\n428\n00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So once that install is done.\n\n429\n00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,060\nThat's it, we would never have any\nother variation of that, or support or\n\n430\n00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,415\nmaintenance to do whatsoever, right?\n\n431\n00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:53,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n432\n00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,000\nYeah, no.\n\n433\n00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880\n>> No.\n\n434\n00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,560\nSorry.\nAll right,\n\n435\n00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,020\nso there are a few other things that\nwe may need to tweak on our system as\n\n436\n00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,500\ntime goes by to make things\na little bit better, right?\n\n437\n00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,990\nAnd some of these may be very simple\nthings, some may be very complex.\n\n438\n00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,800\nMost people that are out there\nhave a computer with just\n\n439\n00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,270\none operating system on it and\nthen that's it.\n\n440\n00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,790\nThey boot to that one OS and\nit's cut and dried.\n\n441\n00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,360\nAnd if you're in that scenario then, yeah,\nyou install Windows and you're done and\n\n442\n00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,168\nyou never have to mess with\nany of your boot options.\n\n443\n00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:21,107\n>> Right?\n\n444\n00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,257\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n445\n00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:27,250\n>> But if you want to dual boot, if you\nwant to have more than one operating\n\n446\n00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,190\nsystem running on your system at the same\ntime, then there are a lot of boot options\n\n447\n00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,120\nthat you may need to tweak, modify, and\nadjust, and whatever to create that.\n\n448\n00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,780\n>> Perfect system for you.\n\n449\n00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,240\n>> We're running it at the same time.\n\n450\n00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,930\nRunning one at a time but\non the same hardware.\n\n451\n00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,240\n>> Good clarification.\n\n452\n00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,420\nYeah, it's not like virtualization\nhardware where we're\n\n453\n00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,950\nrunning at the same time.\n\n454\n00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,140\nYeah, all right.\n\n455\n00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,630\nWell, you could make the argument that\nif you run it around the same time\n\n456\n00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,945\nyou could do hyper view.\n\n457\n00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:54,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> Correct.\n\n458\n00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,430\n>> Another episode.\n\n459\n00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,250\n>> Yeah, another episode.\n\n460\n00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:03,280\n>> All right, so what are some scenarios\nwhere we might want to dual boot?\n\n461\n00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,300\nThe most common scenario is maybe you're\nin the IT department and Microsoft says,\n\n462\n00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,230\nhey, Windows 8.1 release 2 is out,\nor Windows 8.2.\n\n463\n00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,140\nWindows 9, right?\n\n464\n00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,520\nThey've already announced that.\n\n465\n00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,130\nSo.\n>> Windows 9 is coming out.\n\n466\n00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,020\nHere's release candidate one.\n\n467\n00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,565\nGood luck, right?\n\n468\n00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you say well, all right,\n\n469\n00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,780\nI want to run Windows 9, but\nI don't want to just format my laptop and\n\n470\n00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,680\ngo over to it, what if it sucks or\nwhat if my software.\n\n471\n00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,250\n>> Clarify that.\n\n472\n00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,470\nWhat if my software doesn't\nwork in Windows 9, right?\n\n473\n00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,860\nSo, wouldn't it be nice to be\nable to have Windows 8 and\n\n474\n00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,870\nWindows 9 on your system at the same time?\n\n475\n00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,180\nAnd when you boot up,\nyou pick between one or the other.\n\n476\n00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,270\nAnd so if you boot into Windows 9 and\nsomething doesn't work,\n\n477\n00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,000\nyou just boot right back into Windows 8.\n\n478\n00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,980\nYou can flip back and forth and\n\n479\n00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,610\nyou've got the capability because\nboth OSs are installed side by side.\n\n480\n00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,288\n>> Now, there is virtualizing things.\n\n481\n00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:57,282\nNow the multi-boot, for some cases,\n\n482\n00:23:57,282 --> 00:24:03,373\nit is preferred over virtualizing because\nit still runs on the hypervisor and.\n\n483\n00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:04,773\nSometimes you know,\n\n484\n00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:10,064\nwith those synthetic drivers you can't\nreally test everything that you have and\n\n485\n00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:15,039\nso running it on the bare metal you do\nget a much better understanding of how it\n\n486\n00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,905\nis going to function on your machines,\nrather than in a virtual machine.\n\n487\n00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:21,505\nThere's many other scenarios.\n\n488\n00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:22,975\nThe way we use it here, right?\n\n489\n00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:27,495\nSo in some of our early episodes,\nif you watch some of the early A+\n\n490\n00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:32,580\nepisodes we filmed, there were a few times\nwhere I'd be sharing my laptop screen.\n\n491\n00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,450\nAnd all of a sudden I'd get like\na Google Hangout message or\n\n492\n00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,140\nsomething annoying like\nthat on the screen.\n\n493\n00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,679\nAnd it's not like it was\nsecret data I care about but\n\n494\n00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,622\nit was just kind of disturbing [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n495\n00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:45,472\n>> Wrong word,\n\n496\n00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:48,260\nit was annoying would be the better world.\n\n497\n00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,530\nIt wasn't disturbing.\n\n498\n00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,170\n>> Distract.\n\n499\n00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,620\n>> It bugged the hell out\nof me is what it did.\n\n500\n00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,140\n>> Distracting.\n\n501\n00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,090\n>> Distracting there we go, good one.\n\n502\n00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,210\nSo what I said was well,\nunfortunately Google is so\n\n503\n00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,720\ninvasive with their software that you\njust can't like, you can't turn that off.\n\n504\n00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,770\nSo I said, that's it from now on I'm gonna\nhave two operating systems on my laptop.\n\n505\n00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,000\nOne for when I'm on the show and\none for when I'm not.\n\n506\n00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,450\nAnd so I can boot up my laptop and\npick between the two.\n\n507\n00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,290\nThey are both Windows 8.1.\n\n508\n00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,730\nI have two different\ncopies of Windows 8.1.\n\n509\n00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,830\nNot because I wanna try out a new OS or\nwhatever, but so that when I boot up into\n\n510\n00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,710\none I'm not logged into my Google\naccount or my Microsoft account.\n\n511\n00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,770\nI don't have all that stuff.\n\n512\n00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,870\nI can fire up a generic\nInternet Explorer window and\n\n513\n00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,290\nhave just the software needed for\nthe show.\n\n514\n00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:38,370\nAnd then I can reboot and boot into\nthe other OS, and then that's my personal.\n\n515\n00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,830\nAnd that one is logged into my Google\naccount and all that other mess.\n\n516\n00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,380\nSo it's like having a work computer and\na personal computer on the same hardware.\n\n517\n00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,095\nAnd that is a really great use of a\nmachine to keep your business self secure.\n\n518\n00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:54,710\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n519\n00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,120\nI went that same route too,\nand I haven't looked back.\n\n520\n00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,048\nI run a work and a personal.\n\n521\n00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:03,770\nNow also,\n\n522\n00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:09,160\nwhy I went with the multi boot is because\nI also want to run HyperV and so I\n\n523\n00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,940\ndidn't virtualize in the beginning cuz you\ncan't virtualize in a virtualized machine.\n\n524\n00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,400\nSince I wanted to use HyperV, so then,\nyeah, multi-boot and knock that stuff out.\n\n525\n00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,998\n>> Yeah.\nNow when you do this,\n\n526\n00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:24,778\nyou can actually do dual-boot with\njust one hard drive partition.\n\n527\n00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:30,702\nSo I can take my C drive and I can install\none copy of Windows in C:\\windows1 and\n\n528\n00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:35,493\nI can install a second copy in\nC:\\windows2 if I want, right?\n\n529\n00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:39,660\nBut if I do that, my files\nare basically going to blend together.\n\n530\n00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,970\nWe could create separate partitions so\nyou have a C: drive and a D: drive.\n\n531\n00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,450\nThe problem there is, like in my laptop,\nI've got a 256 gig SSD drive,\n\n532\n00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,130\nand that's it.\n\n533\n00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,310\nSo I've got 250 gigs of storage.\n\n534\n00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,850\nIf I divided that in half,\nand I did 128 gigs,\n\n535\n00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,790\nI guess to one iOS and\n128 gigs to the other.\n\n536\n00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,620\nIf one of the filled up and the other\none was sitting there almost empty,\n\n537\n00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,440\nI couldn't share like that storage.\n\n538\n00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,600\nSo an even better solution is to\ncreate virtual hard drive files, VHDs.\n\n539\n00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,810\nAnd we can out one OS in a VHD and\nthe other OS in a separate VHD and\n\n540\n00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,420\nstore them on the same\nhard drive partition.\n\n541\n00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,390\nThat way either one can expand to contain\nmore of the hard drive or less of it.\n\n542\n00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,970\nBut they're also separate.\n\n543\n00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,100\nSo if I boot to one, its files\nare self contained from the other one.\n\n544\n00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,970\nIt gives us complete and\ntotal separation on the machine.\n\n545\n00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,630\nWindows 8.1 supports what's\ncalled native boot from VHD, and\n\n546\n00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,440\nthat means that when we boot our computer,\nit can boot right from that virtual hard\n\n547\n00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,418\ndrive file and off we go in a self\ncontained operating system.\n\n548\n00:27:44,418 --> 00:27:49,930\nIt's really neat, it's easy to set up,\nbut there are zero\n\n549\n00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,390\nvisual clues anywhere throughout windows\n8.1 that even hint that they can be done.\n\n550\n00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,540\nYou basically need to know that\nyou can do it to set it up.\n\n551\n00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,190\nThere's no screen or\noption that's going to pop up and say hey,\n\n552\n00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,300\nwould you like to set up boot from VHD?\n\n553\n00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,620\nIt's just not there.\n\n554\n00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,475\nBut if we know about it it's a really\nneat thing we can use to setup.\n\n555\n00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,595\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n556\n00:28:06,595 --> 00:28:12,120\nYeah, one thing where you could run\ninto with the native VHD boot is\n\n557\n00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,580\nwith BitLocker.\n\n558\n00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,120\nSo what I did on mine is I\ndid create two partitions\n\n559\n00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,250\nbecause on the personal one\nI'm running Bitlocker on that.\n\n560\n00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,680\nIf I try to do a boot to\nVHD it would not work.\n\n561\n00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,000\nAnd so I did create two partitions so\nI can have on the C drive,\n\n562\n00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,100\nhave that one Bitlocker encrypted and\non the D Drive which is the work\n\n563\n00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,410\nprofiles since it's just work stuff and\nI don't lock it all the time.\n\n564\n00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,615\nYou don't really care about it,\nthen it's not encrypted.\n\n565\n00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:41,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because\n\n566\n00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,910\nafter a while you just kind of\nwipe it out and start fresh again.\n\n567\n00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,640\n>> I like how it's the exact opposite\nof what Microsoft expects people to do.\n\n568\n00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,180\nIs you encrypt your personal machine,\nbut not your work machine.\n\n569\n00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And in Microsoft's vision is that\n\n570\n00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,760\nit would be the opposite.\n\n571\n00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,050\nYou want to encrypt the work one.\n\n572\n00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,210\nThat's critical data.\n\n573\n00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,400\nPersonal one who cares.\n\n574\n00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,785\nSomeone will get your elf\nbowling high score or whatever.\n\n575\n00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,070\n[LAUGH]\n>> Elf Bowling?\n\n576\n00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,650\n>> You don't remember Elf Bowling?\n\n577\n00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,980\nDifferent age group I guess.\n\n578\n00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,560\nI don't know.\n\n579\n00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,600\nAll right.\nI had to think of a video game real fast,\n\n580\n00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,200\nand Elf Bowling was what\npopped into my head.\n\n581\n00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,700\n>> All right.\n\n582\n00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,232\n>> Yeah, look it up online.\n\n583\n00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,032\nIt's probably a virus, so\nyou probably shouldn't install it.\n\n584\n00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:18,890\n>> I would think of Pinball FX or\nsomething.\n\n585\n00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,840\n>> Oh yeah, Pinball FX.\n\n586\n00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,530\nI remember that.\n\n587\n00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,290\n>> You remember that one?\n\n588\n00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,520\nOkay.\n>> Is that still on Windows?\n\n589\n00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,468\nI don't know we're deviating,\nWindows 8.1 feature, Pinball FX [LAUGH].\n\n590\n00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:29,682\nSo anyway lots of really cool uses for it.\n\n591\n00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:33,750\nAll right, so let's walk through a few\nscenarios on how to get this setup, right.\n\n592\n00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,280\nOne of the easy ways to set it up is to,\n\n593\n00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,680\nyou know you've already got\nWindows installed on your machine.\n\n594\n00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,260\nYou can add a VHD and boot some\nother OS from it if you'd like to.\n\n595\n00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,780\nOkay, so that's something that you can do.\n\n596\n00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,560\nOne of the problems with going about this,\n\n597\n00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,900\nis the installing process is\na little bit challenging.\n\n598\n00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,210\nSo let me just show some examples\nof kinda going through this and\n\n599\n00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,470\nsome of the things we can tweak with.\n\n600\n00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,512\nSo let me pull up a machine here.\n\n601\n00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:04,816\nAnd here, I changed my wallpaper just for\nthe show.\n\n602\n00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:06,301\n>> [LAUGH] Woo hoo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n603\n00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:06,841\n>> So sorry.\n\n604\n00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:07,900\nSo here I am,\n\n605\n00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,470\nthis is a Windows 8.1 machine right here.\n\n606\n00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,670\nSo good old Windows 8.1.\n\n607\n00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,230\nIt's pretty stock, we haven't really\nmessed with this machine much.\n\n608\n00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,020\nIt is joined to a domain.\n\n609\n00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,840\nIt's got Windows 8.1 installed,\nand that's it.\n\n610\n00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,520\nIt doesn't have anything else as far\nas like custom software or anything.\n\n611\n00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,290\nSo, it's a pretty stock install.\n\n612\n00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,200\nAnd when we installed Windows 8.1 we\ninstalled it right to the hard drive.\n\n613\n00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,150\nWe just did a normal traditional install,\nall right.\n\n614\n00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,510\nSo, let's say this is going\nto be my work computer,\n\n615\n00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,790\nbut I wanna have a Personal computer also.\n\n616\n00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,790\nAll right.\n\n617\n00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,050\nWell I can create a virtual hard drive and\nthen I can install to it.\n\n618\n00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:49,520\nNow if I've done dual boot,\nif I've done dual boot where I just\n\n619\n00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,330\ninstalled on the same drive, then there's\nnot really anything extra I have to do.\n\n620\n00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:56,850\nJust you boot off the Window 8 disk you\ndo an install and you pick a different\n\n621\n00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,360\ndirectory and for that we do have\nsome GUI tools available for us.\n\n622\n00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,040\nLet me get into our system tool.\n\n623\n00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,725\nThere we go.\n\n624\n00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:06,975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kind of took it a second.\n\n625\n00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:08,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a clean install.\n\n626\n00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,640\nSlow.\n\n627\n00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,230\nAll right, so\nhere I am in my system control panel.\n\n628\n00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,550\nAnd in here you'll see\nsome various options.\n\n629\n00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,920\nI want this Advanced system settings.\n\n630\n00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,960\nAnd in Advance system settings\nyou'll see Startup and Recovery and\n\n631\n00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,510\nthis has to do with well things that\nhappen on your system when you start up.\n\n632\n00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,170\nSo let me go into those settings.\n\n633\n00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,490\nAnd this is kinda small.\n\n634\n00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,528\nLet me turn on my little zoom program.\n\n635\n00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:39,190\nWhich is [LAUGH]\nburied away here somewhere.\n\n636\n00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,778\nOh come on, there we go.\n\n637\n00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,180\nTwenty clicks later,\nI will be able to zoom in on this.\n\n638\n00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,788\nAll right, I'm a big fat liar.\n\n639\n00:31:50,788 --> 00:31:52,127\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, this will do.\n\n640\n00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,756\nSo if you're set up for dual boot,\n\n641\n00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:59,213\nwhere you just installed two\nOSs onto the same partition.\n\n642\n00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:02,595\nYou'll see right here where you've got\nthis default operating system where you\n\n643\n00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:05,480\npick which operating system you\nwant to boot from, all right?\n\n644\n00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,600\nSo do I want to boot from Windows 8.1 or\nand\n\n645\n00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,290\nthen whatever the other OS happens to be.\n\n646\n00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,720\nIf you're doing that,\n\n647\n00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,240\nyou probably want to adjust the menu\nthat displays when your system boots up.\n\n648\n00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,700\nNow, if you're only got one OS,\nyou don't need the boot menu.\n\n649\n00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,040\nThere's no choice, and so\nit doesn't even show it to you.\n\n650\n00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,170\nThe computer tries to boot as\nfast as it can from the one\n\n651\n00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,590\noperating system that it has.\n\n652\n00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,220\nAll right.\n\n653\n00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,810\nBut if we have more than one OS installed,\n\n654\n00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,530\nyou have this menu that will\ndisplay to let you pick.\n\n655\n00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,450\nAnd you can define a timeout interval.\n\n656\n00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,960\nIt defaults to 30 seconds.\n\n657\n00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,440\nSo your computer will sit there for\n30 seconds, giving you the chance to pick.\n\n658\n00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,000\nIf you don't pick it will boot whatever\noperating system is in this drop down box.\n\n659\n00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,500\nRight here.\n\n660\n00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,540\nNow, after that it boots up, everything\nelse runs like normal, nothing too crazy.\n\n661\n00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,320\nBut you'll notice after\nthis drop down box and\n\n662\n00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,580\nstuff there's not really\nany other options.\n\n663\n00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,890\nI can't add another operating system here.\n\n664\n00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,570\nI can't even change the name of the OS.\n\n665\n00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,120\nAnd this is just really simple.\n\n666\n00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,990\nYou pick the default, and you define\nhow long you want that menu to show up.\n\n667\n00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,610\nAll right?\n\n668\n00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,430\nNow this computer only has one\noperating system on it, so\n\n669\n00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,500\nI don't really have a whole lot\nof fun stuff that I can do there.\n\n670\n00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,985\nIf I want to install\nanother operating system.\n\n671\n00:33:15,985 --> 00:33:18,555\nI could do the dual boot thing\nwhere I add it as a second\n\n672\n00:33:18,555 --> 00:33:20,615\noperating system on the hard drive.\n\n673\n00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:26,565\nOr I could do the native-boot from VHD,\nwhich is cooler, in my opinion.\n\n674\n00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:28,582\nSo, so let's kind of walk through that.\n\n675\n00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:31,632\nNow, there's two ways to\nset up native VHD, and\n\n676\n00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:34,762\none way is what I call the hard way,\nyou know, the Microsoft way.\n\n677\n00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,842\nAnd the other one is,\nis a little bit easier.\n\n678\n00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:40,300\nBasically, what you have to do is,\nis a few steps.\n\n679\n00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,370\nStep one, you have to create the virtual\nhard drive, just an empty drive.\n\n680\n00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,710\nStep two, you've gotta set it to where\nyour system knows that it can boot\n\n681\n00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,330\nfrom that virtual hard drive.\n\n682\n00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,150\nAnd then step three,\n\n683\n00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,590\nyou need to install an operating\nsystem into that virtual hard drive.\n\n684\n00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,880\nYou've gotta get your data\npopulated in there somehow.\n\n685\n00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,560\nAll right?\n\n686\n00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,410\nAnd there's several different\nways to go about it.\n\n687\n00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:05,800\nMicrosoft has an article\nthat they released on this,\n\n688\n00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,180\nand let me just pull that up here.\n\n689\n00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,280\nAdding a Native-Boot Virtual Hard Disk\nto the Boot Menu, and\n\n690\n00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,150\nyou've got a series of commands you can\ngo through here to take that virtual hard\n\n691\n00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:21,640\ndrive, mount it to a drive letter,\nand get it attached to your boot menu.\n\n692\n00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,160\nAll right, so if you want to do it by\nhand, by all means you can do it this way.\n\n693\n00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,440\nOr you can let the Windows Installer\ndo it for you.\n\n694\n00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,110\nIf you're going to be installing the OS,\nthis is way to make it do the work for\n\n695\n00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,340\nyou, and\nthat's what I want to show you guys.\n\n696\n00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,640\nThis right, the how to do it by hand\noption, it's showing how to add\n\n697\n00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,860\nWindows 7 to a Windows 8 boot disk so\nyou can have a second Windows 7 machine.\n\n698\n00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,470\nIt's a good way to do it.\n\n699\n00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,570\nI'll post the link to this article\non the website when we post this\n\n700\n00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,560\nepisode on there.\n\n701\n00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,230\nI'll get this link posted right\nbeneath it so you guys can have it.\n\n702\n00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:57,710\nBut it shows the step-by-step way of\nmanually performing the option, right?\n\n703\n00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,702\nBut a lot of this can be shortened for\nus, and I'll show you guys how.\n\n704\n00:35:01,702 --> 00:35:03,862\nAll right, so I'm going to go\nback to that Windows 8 machine,\n\n705\n00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:08,340\nright here, and I'm going to\nstart just by shutting it down.\n\n706\n00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,510\nSo let me do that.\n\n707\n00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:17,250\nAll right, so\nwe're going to shut that guy down and\n\n708\n00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,880\nwe're going to boot off of a,\nI did issue a shut down, didn't I?\n\n709\n00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,850\nOh, it's currently shutting down.\n\n710\n00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,350\nSo I'm going to boot off\nof the Windows 8.1 disks.\n\n711\n00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,390\nNow this is a virtual machine, so\nyou can see that I'm in Hyper-V here, but\n\n712\n00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,300\nit's the exact same on a physical machine.\n\n713\n00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,830\nIt makes no difference.\n\n714\n00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,590\nSo I'm going to power this thing on,\nand when it powers on.\n\n715\n00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,620\nI've got the Windows 8.1 disk in there, so\n\n716\n00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,660\nit's going to ask me to press\nany key to boot from DVD.\n\n717\n00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,160\nAnd I think I pressed it.\n\n718\n00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,260\nWe'll find out here in a minute.\n\n719\n00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:54,315\nAnd so, we're just gonna boot off the DVD.\n\n720\n00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:59,465\nAll right, now, normally when you boot off\nthe DVD and you go to do an install, well,\n\n721\n00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:01,635\nyou're installing to\nan internal hard drive, right?\n\n722\n00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:04,055\nSo when I start my installer\nI can hit Next and\n\n723\n00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:08,275\nInstall Now, and\nwe can kinda move forward.\n\n724\n00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:11,835\nAnd we're gonna see the hard drive,\nthe internal hard drive.\n\n725\n00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:15,035\nNow it's gonna spot that there's\nalready a copy of Windows 8, so\n\n726\n00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:17,390\nit's gonna ask me about that.\n\n727\n00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,050\nBut this is kind of what we\nwould do with a normal install.\n\n728\n00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:25,890\nSo we just kind of move forward,\nI can choose to do a custom install, and\n\n729\n00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,910\nthen here's the internal hard drive,\nthere's actually more than one hard drive\n\n730\n00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,310\nin this system, so\nthis is the first one here.\n\n731\n00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:35,280\nBut I can see this, looks like a 60\ngig hard drive sitting here and\n\n732\n00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,610\nit's the one that already\nhas my operating system.\n\n733\n00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,972\nI can choose to install right there.\n\n734\n00:36:39,972 --> 00:36:43,480\nAll right, but notice how there's\nno option in here for like a VHD,\n\n735\n00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,320\nif I wanna install to a VHD,\nit's just not there.\n\n736\n00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:53,050\nSo what we can do is instead of\njust kind of trusting what's here,\n\n737\n00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,210\nthere's a little keyboard shortcut.\n\n738\n00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,410\nAnd I try to do this in\none of the other episodes.\n\n739\n00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,960\nAnd I couldn't remember for\nthe life of me.\n\n740\n00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,580\nBut today, I remember it.\n\n741\n00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,100\nIs that when you're doing the install,\nhere's where the secrets start.\n\n742\n00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100\nYou can press Shift F10.\n\n743\n00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,770\nShift+F10 will bring up\na command prompt and\n\n744\n00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,220\nfrom the command prompt,\nwe can create a VHD, mount the VHD, and\n\n745\n00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,790\nthen we can install to it,\ncuz the VHD has been created.\n\n746\n00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,510\nAnd when we install this way,\n\n747\n00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,970\nthe operating system will get put into the\nVHD, and it'll be added to our boot menu,\n\n748\n00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,610\nand so we'll be able to have\nthat second copy that we need.\n\n749\n00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,410\nSo that's what I'm going to do here.\n\n750\n00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,580\nSo let me bump the font size up on this,\nso we can all read it.\n\n751\n00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,680\nAnd we'll see if I can remember all these\ncommands off the top of my head because\n\n752\n00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,635\nI didn't bother to write them down.\n\n753\n00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Why would I do something crazy like\n\n754\n00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,318\nthat, right?\n\n755\n00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:49,700\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthat's a little bit better.\n\n756\n00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,040\nAlright, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nfire up the Diskpart Utility which is\n\n757\n00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,970\nthe command line disk partition editor,\nand\n\n758\n00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,230\nI'm just gonna say list disk, and\nthat disk zero, that 60 gig disk,\n\n759\n00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,030\nthat's where my operating system is right\nnow the VHD, I could put it anywhere.\n\n760\n00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,450\nI could put it on disk one or disk two.\n\n761\n00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:10,770\nBut most computers only\nhave one hard drive and\n\n762\n00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,430\nso I want to kind of\nfollow that model right.\n\n763\n00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:19,230\nI want to basically mimic what we\nwould do on a normal system and\n\n764\n00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,420\nso here's that hard drive,\nthe C drive on this system and\n\n765\n00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,030\nI'm gonna create a sub\nfolder here called VHD Boot.\n\n766\n00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:31,260\nAnd you can call the folder whatever\nyou want, I'm just calling it that so\n\n767\n00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:31,980\nI can remember it.\n\n768\n00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:33,890\nRight?\n\n769\n00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,660\nSo I just created that\nsubfolder right there.\n\n770\n00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,195\nAnd in this part, I can go in here and\n\n771\n00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:46,645\nwe can create a VHD,\nwe can just build our own right from here.\n\n772\n00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:49,555\nAnd I have to remember it's add vdisk.\n\n773\n00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,688\nI might need to use the help on this one.\n\n774\n00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:54,241\nSo we go, help at vdisk, there we go.\n\n775\n00:38:54,241 --> 00:39:01,100\nIn this part you've got a bunch\nof disk commands that you can do.\n\n776\n00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,960\nYou've also got vdisk commands that you\ncan use and so you'll see those for\n\n777\n00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,530\ncreating them.\n\n778\n00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,160\nAnd actually this is the wrong help.\n\n779\n00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,730\nThere we go, vdisk.\n\n780\n00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,570\nSo, you'll see in the vdisk command,\nwhere we've got like vdisk create.\n\n781\n00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,230\nRight there, for creating a volume\npartition or virtual disk.\n\n782\n00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:26,210\nAnd so, if I do help, vdisk, create.\n\n783\n00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,617\nWe can see the syntax of that command,\nor not.\n\n784\n00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,236\nApparently it doesn't have context help so\n\n785\n00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:42,900\nlet me just fire up old\nInternet Explorer we'll pull it up here.\n\n786\n00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,678\nWow.\n\n787\n00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,325\nThat is not Internet Explorer.\n\n788\n00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:55,436\nI just want to get the syntax.\n\n789\n00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,681\nThe syntax isn't too much.\n\n790\n00:39:56,681 --> 00:40:00,490\nYou basically specify the size of\nthe virtual disk that you want to make.\n\n791\n00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,340\nSo there's not too much.\n\n792\n00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,240\nHere we go.\n\n793\n00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,630\nIt's kind of microscopic.\n\n794\n00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,066\nLet me zoom in on that.\n\n795\n00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:10,390\nSo the command that we're going\nto run is create V disk, file and\n\n796\n00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,850\nthat's where we'll specify\nwhere the file is and\n\n797\n00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,070\nthen we can specify if it's a fixed\ndisk or if it's expandable.\n\n798\n00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,890\nIf it's already the size\nthat it needs to be or\n\n799\n00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,320\ndo I want it to just grow as I fill it up?\n\n800\n00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,130\nAnd, normally, that's what we want,\nwe want it to be expandable.\n\n801\n00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,650\nAnd then the last thing that we\nneed to specify is the size,\n\n802\n00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:34,060\nwhich is, oh let's see,\ngonna be that maximum value there.\n\n803\n00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,690\nSo we just have a couple of little\nvalues that we need to specify so\n\n804\n00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:40,330\nit's not that complex of a command.\n\n805\n00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,420\nAnd as we scroll down here we\ncan see that their maximum.\n\n806\n00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,050\nThe maximum amount of space that is\nexposed by the VHD file in megabytes.\n\n807\n00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,750\nSo that's the other one that we need\nto specify is that size in megabytes.\n\n808\n00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,951\nSo I'll go ahead and\nsay V disk create, file equals,\n\n809\n00:40:57,951 --> 00:41:02,920\nand I'm gonna put this\nin C colon VHD boot.\n\n810\n00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,570\nAnd let's call this,\nthis'll be my personal Windows aid.\n\n811\n00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,340\nSo I'm just going to call it personal.VHD,\nall right.\n\n812\n00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,820\nAnd I'll throw in there maximum equals.\n\n813\n00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,510\nAnd I've got a 60 gigabyte drive, so I can\nset the maximum to really whatever I want.\n\n814\n00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,350\nIt is represented in megabytes.\n\n815\n00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,705\nSo I'm gonna put it at,\nlet's just say I'll set it at 30 gigs, so\n\n816\n00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:27,360\n30,000 megabytes.\n\n817\n00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,520\nAnd that should be all we need.\n\n818\n00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,660\nAm I leaving anything out there?\n\n819\n00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,270\n>> Looks good.\n\n820\n00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:32,770\n>> I think that's it.\n\n821\n00:41:35,132 --> 00:41:37,940\nCreate V disk file,\noh I didn't say type expandable.\n\n822\n00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,040\nLet me add that in there.\n\n823\n00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,561\nThat will make it happy.\n\n824\n00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:46,510\nType equals expandable.\n\n825\n00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,366\nNice.\n\n826\n00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:52,070\nV disk create file=c:\\--\n\n827\n00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:56,350\n>> Flip the V disk and the create V disk.\n\n828\n00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,300\n>> Is it?\n\n829\n00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,625\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, give it a shot.\n\n830\n00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:04,180\n>> [LAUGH]\nThere we go.\n\n831\n00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,150\nThank you, Nick.\n>> You're welcome.\n\n832\n00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,270\n>> All right, so\nnow I've created that virtual hard disk.\n\n833\n00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,820\nAll right, but I need to attach\nthe virtual hard disk to my system.\n\n834\n00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,490\nIt's just a VHD file sitting on\nthe hard drive right now right?\n\n835\n00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,403\nSo we've got the attach command and\n\n836\n00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:24,750\nwe can attach V disk file equals and\nthen we can specify that file.\n\n837\n00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,864\nApparently my syntax is wrong.\n\n838\n00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:38,090\nWhat did I leave off?\n\n839\n00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,010\nOh we have to go into the V\ndisk prompt don't we?\n\n840\n00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,280\nSo we just say attach V disk.\n\n841\n00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,030\nAnd now there we go.\n\n842\n00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:55,990\nSo now I've got a 30 gig disc showing\nup and I can use that disc to install\n\n843\n00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,815\nto if I want cuz now it's actually\nshowing up as a physical disc.\n\n844\n00:42:58,815 --> 00:43:02,080\nSo and just to refresh cuz\nI did that kinda quick,\n\n845\n00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,030\nthe two commands that I've run so far.\n\n846\n00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,980\nFirst off I created the virtual disk, so\n\n847\n00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,895\nthe command was create v disk file and\nI pointed to a file.\n\n848\n00:43:09,895 --> 00:43:10,440\nMm-hm.\n\n849\n00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,340\n>> Type expandable, maximum equals,\nand I did 30 gigabytes, 30,000.\n\n850\n00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,890\nAnd then we just run attach V disk by\nitself and that attached to the system.\n\n851\n00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,570\nIf I go back here to this screen and\nhit refresh,\n\n852\n00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:30,290\nwhen it refreshes I should now see a 30\ngig disk that wasn't there a minute ago.\n\n853\n00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:34,430\nAnd we'll give that a second.\n\n854\n00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:39,490\nThere it is, down here at the bottom I now\nhave a drive three with 30 gigs of space.\n\n855\n00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,680\nThat is the VHD file.\n\n856\n00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,310\nNow I can continue my\ninstall like normal and\n\n857\n00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,710\nit's gonna install right\ninto the 30 gig file.\n\n858\n00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,900\nSo I'll go ahead and hit next.\n\n859\n00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,020\nSo I highlighted that disk,\nit's gonna partition it out itself.\n\n860\n00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,550\nRight?\n\n861\n00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,695\nAnd now it's gonna do the install.\n\n862\n00:43:56,695 --> 00:43:58,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n863\n00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,010\nThat's pretty sweet Don.\n\n864\n00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:04,526\nBefore when I've kind of gone this route,\n\n865\n00:44:04,526 --> 00:44:09,440\nI went a different method,\nas from inside of Windows.\n\n866\n00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,475\nI would create the VHD and\nthen mount it and use the DISM commands.\n\n867\n00:44:13,475 --> 00:44:16,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To apply an image to it and then you\n\n868\n00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:22,520\nreboot Windows, and it finds it and it\ngoes so same outcome two different ways.\n\n869\n00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,520\n>> Yeah and I didn't wanna do it\nthat way because I know you're gonna\n\n870\n00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,380\nbe showing how the DISM command works\n>> Here in a little bit, right?\n\n871\n00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,586\nWhen you do the image up,\nactually, I'm gonna do it.\n\n872\n00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:32,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's part of our objectives.\n\n873\n00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,280\nSo we're gonna show that method\nin a few minutes anyway.\n\n874\n00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,410\nSo I wanted to show this method\ncuz it is easier, right?\n\n875\n00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:42,060\nWe don't have to mount the VHD ourselves\nand apply an install image to it.\n\n876\n00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,180\nWe let the installer do it.\n\n877\n00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,030\nSo it's installing right now,\nand we don't need to sit here and\n\n878\n00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:46,860\nwatch the percentages.\n\n879\n00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,650\nIt's actually time to take a break anyway,\nso why don't we stop and\n\n880\n00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,750\ntake a break right here?\n\n881\n00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:56,438\nAnd when we get back, we can launch\nback into this, and see the end results.\n\n882\n00:44:56,438 --> 00:44:57,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Sound good?\n\n883\n00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,110\n>> Sounds good.\n\n884\n00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,360\n>> All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n885\n00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,232\nWhen we get back,\nwe'll find out what happens with this, and\n\n886\n00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,540\nmove on with the rest of our technologies.\n\n887\n00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:07,393\n[MUSIC]\n\n888\n00:45:11,015 --> 00:45:13,640\n[LAUGH] All right.\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n889\n00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,700\nOkay.\nSo during the break, the install finished.\n\n890\n00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,370\nAnd the system reboots automatically\nas part of the installer.\n\n891\n00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,540\nAnd now I'm looking at that boot menu.\n\n892\n00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,100\nLet's bring up my machine here.\n\n893\n00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,770\nSo, I'm looking at that boot menu\nthat comes up when you boot up.\n\n894\n00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,110\nNow, you don't normally see this boot menu\ncuz you normally just have one OS but\n\n895\n00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:32,755\nI now have two.\n\n896\n00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:34,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n897\n00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,780\n>> This is the first glimpse we get of\none of the problems with duel booting\n\n898\n00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,540\nis I just installed the second copy\nof Windows 8 so I can now pick.\n\n899\n00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,050\nDo I want to boot Windows 8?\n\n900\n00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,332\nOr Windows 8?\n\n901\n00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:45,294\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n902\n00:45:45,294 --> 00:45:47,120\n>> Well, which one is which?\n\n903\n00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,920\nThey both have the same doggone name,\nright?\n\n904\n00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,030\nIt's very frustrating.\n\n905\n00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,650\nSo they're both called Windows 8.1,\nand that's it.\n\n906\n00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,580\nBut I can look at the volume numbers,\nand I can see one on volume four and\n\n907\n00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,830\none on volume ten.\n\n908\n00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,060\nSo I know that volume four\nis my original one, and\n\n909\n00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,180\nthen volume ten is the new one that I\nadded, it's just a higher volume number.\n\n910\n00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,980\nAll right.\n\n911\n00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,750\nBut wouldn't it be nice if they had\nnames that matched their purpose,\n\n912\n00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,300\nlike personal versus work or whatever.\n\n913\n00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,370\nOkay, well, we don't get an easy GUI for\nchanging the names on these,\n\n914\n00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,660\nand so what we're gonna do is,\nwe're going to change it,.\n\n915\n00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,900\nBut we'll need to get into the command\nprompt to do it, and I'm gonna go ahead.\n\n916\n00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,600\nOh.\n>> Oh, before you click away,\n\n917\n00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,670\njust notice that you have these\ncool Windows icons on there.\n\n918\n00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,310\nSo you have the little Windows icons,\nso just-\n\n919\n00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,580\n>> And it is touch enabled, so\n\n920\n00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,530\nif you're on a touch screen.\n\n921\n00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,930\nVersus the old boot menus,\nyou had to use your arrow keys.\n\n922\n00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,530\nBut because Windows might be running on\na tablet now, they made it touch enabled.\n\n923\n00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,830\n>> Yep, so you got little Windows icons.\n\n924\n00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,397\n>> Woo hoo.\n\n925\n00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:40,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n926\n00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,510\nSo I'm gonna boot up Windows 8.1 here.\n\n927\n00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,310\nAnd really,\nit doesn't matter which one I boot.\n\n928\n00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:46,150\nI just need to boot into one of them.\n\n929\n00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,050\nAnd from there I can modify the names\nto reflect what the installations\n\n930\n00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,870\nactually do.\n\n931\n00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,099\nSo here it goes, booting up.\n\n932\n00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,770\nThe older, the orignal Windows 8 install.\n\n933\n00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,180\nAt least, what I think it is.\n\n934\n00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,384\nI potentially the volume numbers could\nhave changed, and then I'd have it wrong.\n\n935\n00:47:01,384 --> 00:47:03,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But it should be that the lower\n\n936\n00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,145\nvolume number is the original and\nthe higher volume number is the newer one.\n\n937\n00:47:06,145 --> 00:47:09,960\n>> Also typically when we need to install,\nthe newer one goes on top.\n\n938\n00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,690\nSo that way you don't\nreally have to guess.\n\n939\n00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,970\nIf you just set it up,\nthe new one's on top.\n\n940\n00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,986\n>> Okay, so it's just organized\nby when they were created?\n\n941\n00:47:15,986 --> 00:47:16,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n942\n00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,468\nTypically.\n\n943\n00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:18,356\n>> Typically.\n\n944\n00:47:18,356 --> 00:47:18,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n945\n00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,130\n>> Well, whenever we get in here,\nwe'll stick a name on there, and\n\n946\n00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,870\nthen we, oh it's the enhanced\nsession mode kicking in.\n\n947\n00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:28,170\n>> Oh, yeah nice.\nI know all about that one.\n\n948\n00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,330\n>> Another new feature.\n\n949\n00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,089\nSo this is definitely is the old one\nbecause we can see it is all ready\n\n950\n00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:34,530\njoined to the domain and all that.\n\n951\n00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:39,130\nSo we'll just boot in here and then once\nI get in I'll be able to rename these.\n\n952\n00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,660\nNow, that graphical user interface I\nshowed you earlier, where we could see\n\n953\n00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,390\nthe multiple OSes and pick how long\nthat boot menu stayed up and all that.\n\n954\n00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,028\nRemember it didn't have any options\nin there for changing the names,\n\n955\n00:47:49,028 --> 00:47:49,797\nI couldn't use it.\n\n956\n00:47:49,797 --> 00:47:52,756\nSo I'm gonna have to drop\nto the command prompt and\n\n957\n00:47:52,756 --> 00:47:55,653\nI'm gonna use a little\nutility called BCD Edit.\n\n958\n00:47:55,653 --> 00:47:58,611\nBCD Editor is like the boot editor for\nWindows 8.\n\n959\n00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:04,400\nAnd lets us modify those boot records\nto change which OS boots and so on.\n\n960\n00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,110\nIt's been fully updated to reflect UEFI,\nBIOS, and all that stuff.\n\n961\n00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,930\nSo it is a good utility, but\n\n962\n00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,245\njust to refresh here,\nI'm gonna go back into that system.\n\n963\n00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:16,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n964\n00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,910\nI'm gonna go full screen like before?\n\n965\n00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,620\n>> It didn't, it seems to have decided\nit's not gonna go full screen for me.\n\n966\n00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,920\nOh, there we go,\nI guess I just have to ask it nicely.\n\n967\n00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,180\n>> Mm, we were talking to Windows.\n\n968\n00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,660\n>> See?\nPlease, please, Windows,\n\n969\n00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,764\nwill you go full screen for me?\n\n970\n00:48:32,764 --> 00:48:36,040\nAll right, so if I go back here\ninto the System panel, and\n\n971\n00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,760\nI go into Advanced System Settings,\nand I go into Startup and\n\n972\n00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,520\nRecovery, here's my two Windows 8 OSs.\n\n973\n00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,740\nAnd I can change how long\nthat boot menu stays up.\n\n974\n00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:50,980\nBut I don't get the option in here\nto mess around with their names.\n\n975\n00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,800\nSo I'm gonna use BCDEdit to do it.\n\n976\n00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,690\nNow, BCDEdit, by itself,\nif you just run, go to a Command Prompt,\n\n977\n00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,850\nand run BCDEdit, it gives you a list\nof your operating systems and\n\n978\n00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,140\nthe technical details surrounding them.\n\n979\n00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,805\nSo, let me bring that up,\nso I can show it all.\n\n980\n00:49:07,805 --> 00:49:10,800\n>> Wait, you're changing it,\nisn't it white from the beginning?\n\n981\n00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,750\n>> No, it's gray.\n\n982\n00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,201\n>> Oh, is it?\n>> It's gray on black,\n\n983\n00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:14,510\nI just changed it to white.\n\n984\n00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,130\nIt shows up better in the recordings,\nin my opinion.\n\n985\n00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:17,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n986\n00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, you're gonna challenge me?\n\n987\n00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,921\nAnyhow.\n\n988\n00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:23,932\n[LAUGH] So\nif I just run BCDEdit like this,\n\n989\n00:49:23,932 --> 00:49:26,130\nit gives me a list of\nthe operating systems.\n\n990\n00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:31,180\nNow, the operating system that I'm\ncurrently running gets a GUID,\n\n991\n00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,940\na Global Unique Identifier of current,\nright?\n\n992\n00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,120\nNice and easy.\n\n993\n00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,810\nBut the other one will have\nthe old GUID and if I scroll up,\n\n994\n00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,478\nhere's the other install.\n\n995\n00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,842\n>> Default.\n\n996\n00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:45,007\n>> Oh, no, actually, it's called default,\nshoot, that's right,\n\n997\n00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:46,010\nbecause it's the default one.\n\n998\n00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,710\nIf I was booted to the default one,\nthis one would have the full GUID.\n\n999\n00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:53,095\nAnd if you wanna see like what a full GUID\nlooks like, it looks like this right here.\n\n1000\n00:49:53,095 --> 00:49:54,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a big long string of\n\n1001\n00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,300\nmess to type in.\n\n1002\n00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:00,176\nFortunately, we can use these shortcut\nnames to make these commands a little bit\n\n1003\n00:50:00,176 --> 00:50:03,140\neasier, but\nyou'll see each one has a description.\n\n1004\n00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,870\nAnd that description is\nthe name of the machine and\n\n1005\n00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,510\nthe name of that install when we boot up,\nall right?\n\n1006\n00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:13,220\nNow you can see right here,\nthis one is C:/VHDboot/personal.VHD,\n\n1007\n00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,320\nthat's my personal machine,\nthe default one.\n\n1008\n00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,230\nBut the current one,\n\n1009\n00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:21,520\nthe one I'm booted into right now,\nsee, its device is just C:.\n\n1010\n00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,220\nThat was the one that we installed before,\nthat's gonna be my work one, right?\n\n1011\n00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:30,100\nSo, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run\nBCDEdit, and I'm gonna modify that.\n\n1012\n00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,880\nI'm gonna say /set {current].\n\n1013\n00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,110\nSo, I'm gonna modify the one that I'm\ncurrently booted to, description,\n\n1014\n00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:47,359\nwindows, and I'm doing spaces, so I have\nto put it in quotes, windows 8.1 (work).\n\n1015\n00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:48,350\nLike that.\n\n1016\n00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,410\n>> I thought you were just gonna put 8.1.\n\n1017\n00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,430\nLike, oh,\nvery creative way of changing that name.\n\n1018\n00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,710\n>> [LAUGH] Change it right\nback to what it was.\n\n1019\n00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,881\nSo I'm just adding basically\nwork to the end of it so\n\n1020\n00:50:56,881 --> 00:50:58,710\nthat I'll know that that's the work one.\n\n1021\n00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,506\nAnd then I'm gonna do the same thing for\n\n1022\n00:51:01,506 --> 00:51:05,190\nthe other one except I'm\ngonna say (Personal).\n\n1023\n00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,730\nAnd it's not the current one, I'm not\nbooted to it, it's the default one for me.\n\n1024\n00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:13,280\nSo I'll do that, and\nnow when I run BCDEdit and\n\n1025\n00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,200\nI look at the two, I can see I'm\ncurrently booted to my work one.\n\n1026\n00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,700\nAnd, my default is that personal one,\nright?\n\n1027\n00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,860\nSo that has changed.\n\n1028\n00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:28,350\nAnd if I go back to my System panel,\nand I go to my Advanced Settings, and\n\n1029\n00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:33,630\nI go into my Startup and Recovery, I can\nnow see my menu makes a lot more sense.\n\n1030\n00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,330\nSo, maybe I wanted to\ndefault to my work one.\n\n1031\n00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,150\nSo, I'm gonna change that.\n\n1032\n00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,890\nSo, I'm now defaulting to the work one.\n\n1033\n00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,610\nAnd I might wanna display my\nlist of operating systems for\n\n1034\n00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:45,240\n15 seconds or whatever,\nI can modify that here.\n\n1035\n00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,721\nAnd off we go.\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n1036\n00:51:46,721 --> 00:51:48,005\njust leave those like they are.\n\n1037\n00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1038\n00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:53,840\n>> And we'll reboot and I'll boot into\nthe other operating system this time.\n\n1039\n00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1040\n00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:00,320\nNice.\n\n1041\n00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,030\n>> So here we go.\n\n1042\n00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:05,220\nAnd it's gonna drop out to\nthe Hyper-V screen since it is a VM.\n\n1043\n00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,300\nBut when it boots, I'll get my boot menu.\n\n1044\n00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,010\nWell, I have to wait for it to boot.\n\n1045\n00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,180\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> False.\n\n1046\n00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,550\nYou know, that was fast.\n\n1047\n00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,262\n>> Mm-hm, it was fast.\n\n1048\n00:52:16,262 --> 00:52:19,800\n>> So [INAUDIBLE] for a second and then\nit'll boot up and I'll have that choice.\n\n1049\n00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,644\nSo the key thing here is, it's now\ninstalled to a virtual hard drive,\n\n1050\n00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:27,161\nto a VHD, and it's kind of isolated\nfrom the rest of the system,\n\n1051\n00:52:27,161 --> 00:52:29,860\nthe rest of the data on my computer.\n\n1052\n00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,470\nSo I now have a work and a personal\nmachine and I can easily keep my data\n\n1053\n00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,740\nseparate, and if you're doing two VHDs,\nyou could even BitLocker one of them,\n\n1054\n00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,000\nnot the other one, you could BitLocker\nboth of them with two different keys.\n\n1055\n00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,845\nThere's all sorts of stuff you can do, and\nat the end of the day if I don't want my\n\n1056\n00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:48,700\npersonal machine there anymore,\nI can just go and delete that VHD.\n\n1057\n00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,470\nNow it's gone, right?\n\n1058\n00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:53,550\nSo really easy to maintain\ncustody of that data.\n\n1059\n00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1060\n00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,120\n>> Maintaining custody, that's\nthe official, whatever, there we go.\n\n1061\n00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,990\nSo now I can see Windows 8.1 (Work),\nWindows 8.1 (Personal).\n\n1062\n00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:08,400\nAnd it's even denoting that this one\nis a VHD, not the actual hard drive.\n\n1063\n00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,120\nBut now I can pick and choose.\n\n1064\n00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,990\nI'll pick the personal one.\n\n1065\n00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:13,030\nNow, this is the first\ntime I've booted it,\n\n1066\n00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:16,700\nso I'm gonna get the Windows Setup,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n1067\n00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,360\nBut I think that pretty\nmuch drives the point,\n\n1068\n00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,720\nso-\n>> Yeah, so the icons that change.\n\n1069\n00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,920\nBefore they had the little Windows logo\non the icons on there, and then just\n\n1070\n00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,290\nrenaming it changes it to just that little\nsquare folder or file looking thing.\n\n1071\n00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,010\n>> Yeah.\nAnd there's a way to fix that but\n\n1072\n00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,160\nit's a super annoying thing.\n\n1073\n00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,080\nI don't normally worry about it.\n\n1074\n00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,590\n>> I haven't seen the one where it\nactually puts the VHD in there too.\n\n1075\n00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,880\nI didn't see that one before.\n\n1076\n00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,130\nYeah, that's really sweet.\n\n1077\n00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,800\nSo you know that it's a VHD.\n\n1078\n00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n1079\n00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,130\nJust little conveniences like that helps\nyou to make sure you're picking the right\n\n1080\n00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,760\none when you boot up.\n\n1081\n00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,810\nSo here's it's going, it's booting, and it\nis gonna take a while cuz it is the very\n\n1082\n00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:56,260\nfirst time I've booted\nthis new operating system.\n\n1083\n00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,940\nBut that's basically VHD,\nor boot from VHD.\n\n1084\n00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,090\nThat's how we set them up.\n\n1085\n00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,310\nThat's how we work with them and\nsupport them.\n\n1086\n00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:09,260\nAfter that, once you boot to them,\nit's a normal machine, right?\n\n1087\n00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,030\nOr no, this was Don's personal machine,\nright?\n\n1088\n00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,560\nThat's what I'm gonna call it.\n\n1089\n00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,750\nDon's personal, oh, 15 characters.\n\n1090\n00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,250\nWhatever.\n\n1091\n00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:20,180\n>> How about D?\n>> DPPERSONAL.\n\n1092\n00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,133\nDone.\n\n1093\n00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:24,140\n[LAUGH]\nNow I'll just press\n\n1094\n00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,240\nEnter 15 times and we'll be done.\n\n1095\n00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,710\nSo, in your work environment you can\nuse this for research and development,\n\n1096\n00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,120\ntrying out betas, you can use it for\npersonal and work machines.\n\n1097\n00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,815\nIt's up to you how you wanna use these,\nand\n\n1098\n00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:37,760\nhow you can make use of\nthem in your environment.\n\n1099\n00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,340\nBut the process is basically the same.\n\n1100\n00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,180\nSo Nate, I think that's about it for\nnative and multi-boot.\n\n1101\n00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,260\nCan you think of anything I left out?\n\n1102\n00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:51,050\n>> Yeah, pretty straight-forward, at least\nfor what we're concerned with here, mm-hm.\n\n1103\n00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,677\n>> All right, well,\n\n1104\n00:54:52,677 --> 00:54:58,510\nthe next objective that we have on\nour list is system images, okay?\n\n1105\n00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:03,340\nSo when we install Windows,\nwe pop in that DVD and we do our install,\n\n1106\n00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,220\nlike I just did right there.\n\n1107\n00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,950\nOn the Windows disk is\na file called install.wim.\n\n1108\n00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:14,910\nWIM, that file extension W-I-M,\nstands for Windows image.\n\n1109\n00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:18,370\nAnd it's just a file\nthat contains an exact\n\n1110\n00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,430\ncopy of a computer that had\nWindows 8.1 installed on it.\n\n1111\n00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:25,460\nSo somewhere at Microsoft headquarters,\none of their guys sat down and\n\n1112\n00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,590\nset up a Windows 8.1 reference machine,\n\n1113\n00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,940\ngot it exactly the way that Microsoft\nwanted it, and then they took an image.\n\n1114\n00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,910\nAnd they created that one big file\nthat was an image of that machine.\n\n1115\n00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,700\nAnd when you install,\n\n1116\n00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,350\nyou're just copying that image to\nyour hard drive or to your VHD.\n\n1117\n00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,720\nThat's it, and that's what everybody does.\n\n1118\n00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,799\nWell, wouldn't it be nice if\nyou could customize that and\n\n1119\n00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:50,056\nmake it a little bit different?\n\n1120\n00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:53,077\nSo let's say you have 1,000\ncomputers in your work, and\n\n1121\n00:55:53,077 --> 00:55:56,113\nyou know you're gonna be rolling\nWindows 8.1 out to them.\n\n1122\n00:55:56,113 --> 00:56:00,703\nBut you're also gonna roll out\nOffice 2013 and Adobe Photoshop,\n\n1123\n00:56:00,703 --> 00:56:02,426\na couple other programs.\n\n1124\n00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:06,718\nWouldn't it be nice to already have those\nprograms be part of that installer, right?\n\n1125\n00:56:06,718 --> 00:56:07,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1126\n00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:08,260\n>> You can do that.\n\n1127\n00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,790\n>> Yeah, as a matter of fact, you can.\n\n1128\n00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,555\n>> [LAUGH] But wait, there's more!\n\n1129\n00:56:12,555 --> 00:56:14,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you can, absolutely.\n\n1130\n00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,670\nSo, what you do,\nis you create a reference machine.\n\n1131\n00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,170\nYou sit down in your IT Department,\nand you take a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n1132\n00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,860\nYou install it, and then you get it\nset up exactly the way you want it.\n\n1133\n00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,172\nYou install Microsoft Office, you change\nyour wallpaper, you do all the various\n\n1134\n00:56:30,172 --> 00:56:34,570\nthings that you need to do to customize\nthat machine to fit your needs.\n\n1135\n00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:39,600\nAnd then,\nyou can take an image of that machine and\n\n1136\n00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,580\nthen deploy that image thousands of times\nacross all of your other computers.\n\n1137\n00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,930\nSo you have a consistent install base that\nall your machines are set up the same way.\n\n1138\n00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,510\nAnd the software that you need\nis already preloaded in them.\n\n1139\n00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:52,730\nYou can preload drivers,\nyou can preload software,\n\n1140\n00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,310\nyou can preload just regular files.\n\n1141\n00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:59,650\nMaybe you have some text documents you\nwant to be present, archives or whatever.\n\n1142\n00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:02,550\nSo you can do all sorts of\nprestaging in that image.\n\n1143\n00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,371\nAnd because you can load drivers, you\ncan make one image that is suitable for\n\n1144\n00:57:06,371 --> 00:57:09,180\nmultiple different types of hardware,\nright?\n\n1145\n00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:13,071\nThere's a lot of products like\nAcronis True Image and Symantec Ghost and\n\n1146\n00:57:13,071 --> 00:57:16,600\nsoftware like that that will\nclone a computer exactly.\n\n1147\n00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,550\nThose are suitable if you have\nthe same hardware everywhere, but\n\n1148\n00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,760\nif you have differing hardware,\n\n1149\n00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,460\nyou really need Windows to detect the new\nhardware to have the drivers and stuff.\n\n1150\n00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,985\nAnd things like Acronis True Image,\nthey don't do that, or\n\n1151\n00:57:27,985 --> 00:57:29,850\nat least not the normal product.\n\n1152\n00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:33,676\nSo Microsoft actually created\nsomething that lets us do that.\n\n1153\n00:57:33,676 --> 00:57:35,676\nSo we can create our own image.\n\n1154\n00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:39,340\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, so DISM tool.\n\n1155\n00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,050\nRight?\nThat's what we're gonna be using?\n\n1156\n00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:43,577\n>> Yep.\nAnd that's the disk image servicing\n\n1157\n00:57:43,577 --> 00:57:46,510\nmanager, modular,\nwhat does DISM stand for?\n\n1158\n00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,218\n>> Yeah, disk image servicing.\n\n1159\n00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:53,968\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, all right.\n\n1160\n00:57:53,968 --> 00:57:56,875\nSo, we don't remember what\nDISM stands for, but the tool,\n\n1161\n00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:59,430\nlet's see if we can figure\nout what it stands for.\n\n1162\n00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,660\n>> If Wes was here, he would know.\n\n1163\n00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,176\n>> Wes would know it off\nthe top of his head.\n\n1164\n00:58:03,176 --> 00:58:05,593\nThe command is DISM and\nI'm pretty sure it's like disk-\n\n1165\n00:58:05,593 --> 00:58:08,761\n>> Development, image, servicing, and\n\n1166\n00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:09,885\nmanagement.\n\n1167\n00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:10,643\nI was way off.\n\n1168\n00:58:10,643 --> 00:58:11,502\n>> All right.\nWell, yeah.\n\n1169\n00:58:11,502 --> 00:58:12,630\n>> I was thinking disk, but no.\n\n1170\n00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:13,730\n>> I don't think I ever knew that.\n\n1171\n00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:18,210\nWell, anyhow, it's a command line utility\nand it's built into Windows 8.1 and\n\n1172\n00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,150\nbasically the idea is\nthat you can sit down and\n\n1173\n00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:25,059\ncreate that machine the way you want and\nthen you can grab that image, all right?\n\n1174\n00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:28,845\nNow, one of the obstacles that we\nhave is if you set up the machine and\n\n1175\n00:58:28,845 --> 00:58:32,850\nyou've got it exactly the way that you\nwant, in order to take a snapshot of\n\n1176\n00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:37,560\nthat partition, you need to be up and\nrunning a Windows 8 utility.\n\n1177\n00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,770\nWell, if you're running Windows 8,\nyou can do it right there on that machine.\n\n1178\n00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:47,370\nOr you can create a Windows PE boot disk,\nand take the image that way, all right?\n\n1179\n00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:50,120\nAnd, Nate, you're gonna cover the Windows\nPE boot disks a little bit later.\n\n1180\n00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,520\nSo, I won't step on your toes for\nthat one.\n\n1181\n00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,810\nBut let's do this.\n\n1182\n00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,550\nI'm gonna take this machine.\n\n1183\n00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,990\nSo here, it's booting into that personal.\n\n1184\n00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:01,240\nI'm gonna reboot this thing.\n\n1185\n00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:02,920\nWhere is it?\n\n1186\n00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,800\nWhich one of these is reset?\n\n1187\n00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,969\n>> Then just hit that little stop button.\n\n1188\n00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:08,843\nThe black one.\n\n1189\n00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:09,510\n>> Where is it?\n\n1190\n00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,184\n>> Oh, all right, there we go.\n\n1191\n00:59:11,184 --> 00:59:12,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The graceful way.\n\n1192\n00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,340\n>> No, I'm just not graceful, that's it.\n\n1193\n00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:13,840\n>> It's not?\n>> No.\n\n1194\n00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,898\nReboot is graceful,\n\n1195\n00:59:14,898 --> 00:59:18,155\nreset is like flipping the power switch.\n>> All right,\n\n1196\n00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,434\ngreat.\n>> So anyhow, so\n\n1197\n00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,269\nI'm just gonna reset this.\nI'm gonna boot back into\n\n1198\n00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:22,380\nthat work machine.\n\n1199\n00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,410\nAnd when I'm in my work machine,\n\n1200\n00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,630\nmaybe I've got that one set up\nexactly the way that I want it, right?\n\n1201\n00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,940\nAnd everything is perfect.\n\n1202\n00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,218\nWell, I just need to take an image.\n\n1203\n00:59:30,218 --> 00:59:33,385\nAnd the DISM utility, D-I-S-M,\nit will let me do that.\n\n1204\n00:59:33,385 --> 00:59:34,926\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1205\n00:59:34,926 --> 00:59:37,814\nNow you can be booted into Windows to do\n\n1206\n00:59:37,814 --> 00:59:38,900\nthat-\n>> Oh, good point, shoot.\n\n1207\n00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,450\n>> That sucker.\n\n1208\n00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,169\nSo you can boot off your boot media.\n\n1209\n00:59:42,169 --> 00:59:44,060\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1210\n00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,280\nI'll take an image of\nthat personal machine.\n\n1211\n00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,370\nWe'll do that one.\n\n1212\n00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:52,050\nSo if I boot off my work machine, that\npersonal one's in a VHD, so I can use it.\n\n1213\n00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,150\nI'll take an image of it.\n\n1214\n00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,565\nWhat would be better is if I booted\noff a Windows PE disk like what you're\n\n1215\n00:59:57,565 --> 00:59:59,430\ngonna show us in a little bit.\n\n1216\n00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,874\nBut I'll do it here the hard way, and\nthen you can, I'm not gonna call it\n\n1217\n01:00:02,874 --> 01:00:05,885\nthe easy way, the Windows PE way\ntakes a little bit of work too.\n\n1218\n01:00:05,885 --> 01:00:08,593\nBut let me just get logged in here.\n\n1219\n01:00:08,593 --> 01:00:13,790\nAll right, so let's say that that VHD\nhad everything that I wanted in it.\n\n1220\n01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:18,370\nI went ahead and\ninstalled Adobe Acrobat and Java and\n\n1221\n01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:22,600\nAdobe Flash and all the other software\nI need for business use, right?\n\n1222\n01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,220\nAnd-\n>> It's funny that you picked those\n\n1223\n01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:26,730\nexamples.\n\n1224\n01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,585\nBecause I looked over and\nyou're not running.\n\n1225\n01:00:28,585 --> 01:00:29,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> PDF viewer.\n\n1226\n01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,170\nYeah, you do not use a Java.\n\n1227\n01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,840\nBut yet those are the ones that you'd\nthrow into your image that you'd\n\n1228\n01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,740\npush out all your machines.\n\n1229\n01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,890\n>> Many companies use them.\n\n1230\n01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,615\nI don't use them myself.\n\n1231\n01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:42,810\n[LAUGH] But yeah, so what we can\ndo is we can take an image of it.\n\n1232\n01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:46,660\nNow we do need to mount that drive so\nthat we can access the data on it.\n\n1233\n01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:49,911\nAnd one of the nice things about install\nto VHD is that it doesn't mount it,\n\n1234\n01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:51,810\nthat it is kind of hidden from view.\n\n1235\n01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,730\nSo if I go into My Computer here,\n\n1236\n01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:56,960\nI don't have a drive letter\nthat points to that VHD.\n\n1237\n01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,450\nSo I need to start by mounting that.\n\n1238\n01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,220\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n1239\n01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:03,960\nAnd I could use the command line like\nthe disk part utility like we did earlier.\n\n1240\n01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,582\nBut usually by this point I'm GUI mode.\n\n1241\n01:01:06,582 --> 01:01:09,503\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let me do it in the GUI.\n\n1242\n01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:13,159\nIf you wanna mount a VHD,\nthere's an easy way to do it right\n\n1243\n01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:16,530\nhere from the disk management\nutility once it loads.\n\n1244\n01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:17,370\nThere we go.\n\n1245\n01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,950\nWe can just right-click here,\nand you'll see Attach VHD.\n\n1246\n01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,920\nYou can also create a VHD here too.\n\n1247\n01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,220\nThat's even easier than\nthe command line we did earlier.\n\n1248\n01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,676\nSo I'm gonna mount that VHD.\n\n1249\n01:01:29,676 --> 01:01:31,926\nAnd you know, actually, do I wanna do it?\n\n1250\n01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:32,886\nYes, I do wanna do it this way.\n\n1251\n01:01:32,886 --> 01:01:33,386\nAll right.\n\n1252\n01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:37,950\nHad a moment there where I was\nthinking about another option.\n\n1253\n01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:41,400\nSo I'm gonna go in and find that VHD,\nthere's my personal VHD,\n\n1254\n01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,140\nand I'm gonna mount it.\n\n1255\n01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:47,910\nNow, if I wanna make changes to it,\nif I wanna add drivers to it and\n\n1256\n01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,360\nstuff like that, I wanna mount it\nread/write so I can mess around with it.\n\n1257\n01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,650\nBut I could also mount it read only\nif I just wanna take an image and\n\n1258\n01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,840\nnot modify anything.\n\n1259\n01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,710\nBut typically, that can cause some issues,\nso I normally go read/write.\n\n1260\n01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:01,870\nSo we'll mount that.\n\n1261\n01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:02,870\nThere we go.\n\n1262\n01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:07,090\nAnd so now that personal hard drive,\nit's right here.\n\n1263\n01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,300\nAnd if I give it a second,\nit'll get a letter there.\n\n1264\n01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,025\nIt's the G drive on my system.\n\n1265\n01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:12,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1266\n01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,176\nAnd it's got a little blue icon\nup there too, to let you know.\n\n1267\n01:02:15,176 --> 01:02:18,926\n>> Letting us know that it's a VHD and\nthat it's special.\n\n1268\n01:02:18,926 --> 01:02:19,635\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1269\n01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:23,400\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so there's my G drive.\n\n1270\n01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,980\nAnd now I'm ready to basically\ntake an image of it.\n\n1271\n01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,480\nNow I am kind of skipping\nwhat would be the long part.\n\n1272\n01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,790\nThe long part would be,\n\n1273\n01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:33,000\nI should have booted this VHD first and\nfully customized it,\n\n1274\n01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,860\nloaded all my custom software and stuff to\nget it the way that my company needs it.\n\n1275\n01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:41,760\nSo then, now that I've got it mounted,\nI can fire up a command prompt.\n\n1276\n01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,960\nAnd I don't think you technically need\nto be an administrator, but I'm gonna go\n\n1277\n01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,520\nahead and run it with administrator\nprivileges, just to be on the safe side.\n\n1278\n01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,830\nAll right.\n\n1279\n01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:56,320\nAnd I'm gonna just create\na folder here called Image,\n\n1280\n01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,990\nwhich is where I'm gonna stick this image.\n\n1281\n01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:01,100\nYou gotta put it somewhere after you make\nit, so this is where we're gonna put it.\n\n1282\n01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,320\nAnd I'm gonna run a command.\n\n1283\n01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,650\nNow, the command is a little bit long, so\n\n1284\n01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,304\nI got my little cheat\nsheet here beside me.\n\n1285\n01:03:06,304 --> 01:03:09,801\nThe D-I-S-M, the DISM,\nthat's the utility that we're gonna use.\n\n1286\n01:03:09,801 --> 01:03:11,635\nAnd if you just run DISM by itself,\n\n1287\n01:03:11,635 --> 01:03:14,427\nit gives you kind of the help\ninformation and stuff.\n\n1288\n01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:18,367\nAnd what I wanna do is say\n\n1289\n01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:25,068\ndism/Capture-Image/Image file and\n\n1290\n01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:29,601\nI created C:/image and so\n\n1291\n01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:33,541\nI'm gonna call this one\n\n1292\n01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:38,676\nDonwork.wim /CaptureDir.\n\n1293\n01:03:38,676 --> 01:03:41,343\nAnd it got G:\\.\n\n1294\n01:03:41,343 --> 01:03:42,176\nAll right.\n\n1295\n01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:45,117\nAnd a WIM file can actually\nstore more than one image, so\n\n1296\n01:03:45,117 --> 01:03:49,259\nyou could actually have several different\nimages stored inside of a WIM file.\n\n1297\n01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:54,817\nSo we need to give this one a name,\n\n1298\n01:03:54,817 --> 01:04:00,983\nwhich I will call Don's work image.\n\n1299\n01:04:00,983 --> 01:04:05,743\nAll right, and when I run that, what it's\ngonna do is it's gonna take a look at that\n\n1300\n01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:08,070\nG drive and it's gonna create an image.\n\n1301\n01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,770\nIt's gonna create a WIM\nfile based on that G drive.\n\n1302\n01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,360\nSo everything that's in there,\nall the software I installed,\n\n1303\n01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,260\nall the drivers that I loaded,\nall the customizations,\n\n1304\n01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:22,740\nas well as the entire Windows 8.1 install\nis all gonna be a part of this WIM.\n\n1305\n01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:28,220\nAnd we can take this WIM file and we can\napply it to other machines out there and\n\n1306\n01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,920\ninstead of having to go through that\nprocess of reinstalling our software,\n\n1307\n01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,934\nit'll all be right there.\n\n1308\n01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:38,820\n>> And of course depending on the size of\nyour drive and the customizations you made\n\n1309\n01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:45,240\nto it, this step could take a considerable\namount of time as it builds that WIM file.\n\n1310\n01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,520\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1311\n01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:51,775\nThe one we use here, our install WIM,\nit's like 60 gigs isn't it?\n\n1312\n01:04:51,775 --> 01:04:53,085\nBecause we've got.\n\n1313\n01:04:53,085 --> 01:04:53,775\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n1314\n01:04:53,775 --> 01:04:58,645\n>> We've got Windows 8,\nwe've got the Adobe CS6 Suite in there,\n\n1315\n01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,235\nwhich is a good 12 gigs by itself.\n\n1316\n01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:04,705\nSo when you start getting all\nthat software loaded in there,\n\n1317\n01:05:04,705 --> 01:05:07,965\nit ends up being a huge amount of data.\n\n1318\n01:05:07,965 --> 01:05:08,885\nAnd it does take a while.\n\n1319\n01:05:08,885 --> 01:05:12,775\nI think the last time I watched Mike\nrebuild it, it was close to two hours.\n\n1320\n01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,320\nI wanna say it was a long time.\n\n1321\n01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:18,590\nThis is just a base install, and\ncould still take a while I guess.\n\n1322\n01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:27,270\nWe can watch it if we browse to\nmy C drive and my image folder.\n\n1323\n01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,400\nWe can kind of see it.\n\n1324\n01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,120\nOh no, it's got a locked file so\nwe won't see the size grow.\n\n1325\n01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,380\nBut basically it's grabbing it.\n\n1326\n01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,145\nNow and it is doing other things too.\n\n1327\n01:05:34,145 --> 01:05:37,990\nThere's some minor manipulations it does\nto the hardware when it creates the image.\n\n1328\n01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:41,550\nIt's basically, for those of you\nthat are old school Windows guys,\n\n1329\n01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:44,580\nyou remember utilities like Sys Prep and\nall that.\n\n1330\n01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,600\nSo it actually does a sort of\n\n1331\n01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:52,090\nversion of that as it kinda generalizes\nthe machine to be ready to clone out.\n\n1332\n01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,250\nWe don't really have to worry about that.\n\n1333\n01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,070\nSo It's kinda taking care of that and\nit does just take awhile to build.\n\n1334\n01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:02,170\nSo once it's done,\nwe now have a WIM file and\n\n1335\n01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,020\nwe can go and\napply that to other machines.\n\n1336\n01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:08,763\nOkay, and what you can do is, Nate's\ngonna build a Windows PE disk for us and\n\n1337\n01:06:08,763 --> 01:06:10,700\nyou could boot off of that and use it.\n\n1338\n01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,490\nOr you could create a VHD.\n\n1339\n01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,520\nI can create a new VHD and mount it.\n\n1340\n01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:22,020\nAnd when I'm ready, all I have to do is\nrun on a slightly different dism command.\n\n1341\n01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:29,950\nWe can run dism/apply/image and\n\n1342\n01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,030\nthen we go through that\nwhole process again.\n\n1343\n01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:37,680\nYou know, image file,\nC:/image/donwork.wim and then.\n\n1344\n01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,670\n>> I think it was image path.\n\n1345\n01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,530\n>> Oh is it image?\n\n1346\n01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,910\n>> Yeah, my bad.\n\n1347\n01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,250\nSorry, I was trying to jump ahead,\nI'm sorry.\n\n1348\n01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:52,050\n>> And then we would specify whatever\ndrive it was that it was mapped to.\n\n1349\n01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,155\nSo you can go through and set this up and\n\n1350\n01:06:55,155 --> 01:07:00,135\nit will deploy that WIM file onto a system\nand get it set up the way that you want.\n\n1351\n01:07:00,135 --> 01:07:00,725\nAlright?\n\n1352\n01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:04,895\nThe other cool thing is when you\nhave one of these image files,\n\n1353\n01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:07,275\nwhat if you are using that image file for\nmonths on end?\n\n1354\n01:07:07,275 --> 01:07:10,865\nWell, Windows updates come out,\ndriver updates come out and stuff.\n\n1355\n01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:12,645\nIt used to be a pain to update the images.\n\n1356\n01:07:12,645 --> 01:07:15,973\nYou'd have to restore it, make all\nyou're changes and redo the image.\n\n1357\n01:07:15,973 --> 01:07:21,860\nBut with dism, we can actually mount\nthe image and make modifications to it.\n\n1358\n01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:27,020\nSo you can do Mount image.\n\n1359\n01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:38,720\nLike that, and remember there could\nbe more than one image in there.\n\n1360\n01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,725\nSo I'm saying index one,\njust the first image that's in there,\n\n1361\n01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,486\nwhich is normally all most of us have.\n\n1362\n01:07:48,326 --> 01:07:55,502\nAnd let's see I'll amount that to,\nI don't know, let's say C:\\donwork.\n\n1363\n01:07:55,502 --> 01:07:58,640\nAll right and so\nif I were to run this then\n\n1364\n01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,021\nwhat that's gonna do is it's gonna mount\nthat image to that folder, C:\\donwork, and\n\n1365\n01:08:03,021 --> 01:08:07,670\nthen I can just browse right in there and\ncopy files into the image, update files,\n\n1366\n01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:12,580\nmake whatever changes I need, and then\nwhen I'm done I just unmount the image and\n\n1367\n01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,240\nthen there's a little command\nto commit the changes.\n\n1368\n01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,780\nActually we have to commit the changes\nfirst and then unmount it.\n\n1369\n01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:23,335\nSo we would run this command right here\nto mount it, make all your changes and\n\n1370\n01:08:23,335 --> 01:08:30,825\nthen you commit by saying\ndism/commit/image and so on, right?\n\n1371\n01:08:30,825 --> 01:08:37,645\nAnd actually I think I've got all\nthese commands written down somewhere.\n\n1372\n01:08:37,645 --> 01:08:38,745\nRight here, here we go.\n\n1373\n01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:40,400\nThis is all three of them right here.\n\n1374\n01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,550\nSo if we take a look at these,\n\n1375\n01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:46,310\nwe've got mounting the image,\nthat mounts it to a folder.\n\n1376\n01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,830\nThen we make our changes,\nand we commit the changes.\n\n1377\n01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:52,130\nIf you skip that step all the changes\nthat you make get deleted.\n\n1378\n01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,760\nRight?\nIt sucks, I've made that mistake.\n\n1379\n01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,650\nSo as you do all your work,\nyou commit the image and\n\n1380\n01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:58,470\nthen when you're done\nyou unmount the image.\n\n1381\n01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,910\nNow it's ready to be\napplied anywhere you want.\n\n1382\n01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:04,100\nSo easy to maintain and update these\nwithout having to retake the whole image.\n\n1383\n01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,815\nSo pretty cool stuff.\n\n1384\n01:09:04,815 --> 01:09:05,510\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n1385\n01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:10,530\nYeah, you know and by putting on that\nslash-commit on your last command\n\n1386\n01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:14,350\nit'll unmount and commit at the same time.\n\n1387\n01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,680\nI didn't know that.\n\n1388\n01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,880\nIt's in my notes and I didn't realize it.\n\n1389\n01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,540\nSo, if we do the slash commit at\nthe end we don't actually need to do\n\n1390\n01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:21,995\nthe individual commit command.\n\n1391\n01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:22,544\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n1392\n01:09:22,544 --> 01:09:23,810\nCool.\nIt will do the same stuff.\n\n1393\n01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:24,310\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> All right.\n\n1394\n01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:24,901\n>> Yeah and\n\n1395\n01:09:24,901 --> 01:09:30,141\nif you unmount it without putting it in\nthere it would throw out a prompt and\n\n1396\n01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:31,470\nit would ask you.\n\n1397\n01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:36,790\nSo if you didn't wanna do it you'd have\nto say not commit or something like that.\n\n1398\n01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:38,010\n>> No I'm not sure,\n\n1399\n01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:42,670\nif I was sure I wouldn't have made\nthe mistake in the first place.\n\n1400\n01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,420\nSo neat stuff.\n\n1401\n01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,740\nMy little notes here,\nI'll post these on the page beneath\n\n1402\n01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:50,420\nthe video when it gets thrown on the\nITProTV website so you can have it there,\n\n1403\n01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,950\nbut it is a really neat process.\n\n1404\n01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:57,480\nIt does save a lot of time as far as\nhaving to go through and create all that.\n\n1405\n01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,070\nSo You can make your own image.\n\n1406\n01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,840\nRapid deployment is facilitated there.\n\n1407\n01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,190\nOne of the tools you'll need to do\nit though is a Windows PE boot disc,\n\n1408\n01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:08,650\nand Nate your gonna\nshow us how to do that.\n\n1409\n01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:12,045\nWe're really right at our break time now,\nso lets do this.\n\n1410\n01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:13,050\nWe'll stop and take a break and\n\n1411\n01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,850\nwhen we get back, you can show us\nhow to make a Windows PE boot disk.\n\n1412\n01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,100\n>> Yeah, it'll take like three minutes.\n\n1413\n01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:18,845\nThere you go.\nThat's it.\n\n1414\n01:10:18,845 --> 01:10:20,414\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so ladies and\n\n1415\n01:10:20,414 --> 01:10:21,500\ngentlemen stay tuned.\n\n1416\n01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,380\nWhen we come back we have\nWindow PE boot disks and\n\n1417\n01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,780\nthen I think we're winding\ndown our objectives aren't we?\n\n1418\n01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,839\nWhat else do we have after that?\n\n1419\n01:10:26,839 --> 01:10:27,600\nThat is the last thing.\n\n1420\n01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,443\n>> And that's it.\n>> All right so we will tackle that and\n\n1421\n01:10:29,443 --> 01:10:30,910\nthen we'll wrap it up from there.\n\n1422\n01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,660\nSo we'll see you guys back after this.\n\n1423\n01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:40,410\n[MUSIC]\n\n1424\n01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,610\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1425\n01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:47,406\nSo, in the last segment I mentioned how it\nwould be super cool and convenient to use\n\n1426\n01:10:47,406 --> 01:10:50,951\na Windows PE disk to boot up to\ntake that image of our machine or\n\n1427\n01:10:50,951 --> 01:10:53,150\napply that image or whatever.\n\n1428\n01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:54,960\nAnd some of you out there\nare probably saying to yourself,\n\n1429\n01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,270\nwait a minute, what is Windows PE?\n\n1430\n01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:00,045\nIs that related to Windows ME\nwhich was horrible?\n\n1431\n01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:02,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the answer is no,\n\n1432\n01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,200\nit's a pretty neat thing.\n\n1433\n01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,980\nNate, you wanna tackle what it is?\n\n1434\n01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:09,150\n>> Yeah, Windows PE is the Windows\npre-execution environment.\n\n1435\n01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:13,660\nAnd what it is is a very stripped\ndown version of Windows and so\n\n1436\n01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:18,980\nstripped down that you can do a very,\nvery limited number of things with it.\n\n1437\n01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,465\nOne thing that you can do with it is\ncustomize is an installation of Windows.\n\n1438\n01:11:23,465 --> 01:11:28,935\nYou can use it well, along with dism,\nto capture an image and apply things.\n\n1439\n01:11:28,935 --> 01:11:30,995\nAnd yeah, when we get around to it,\n\n1440\n01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:35,430\nwhen we fire this thing up here in a few\nminutes, it will look pretty familiar.\n\n1441\n01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:39,110\nSomething that we have seen recently,\nit will look very familiar.\n\n1442\n01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:41,990\nSo the first thing that,\ndid you have anything?\n\n1443\n01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,852\n>> Nope, all you.\n\n1444\n01:11:42,852 --> 01:11:43,411\n>> All right.\n\n1445\n01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:48,883\nSo the first thing to do is we need\nto install the Windows Assessment and\n\n1446\n01:11:48,883 --> 01:11:50,663\nDeployment Tool Kit.\n\n1447\n01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:54,888\nNow, unlike dism the, you know, the other\ntools that we're using it is not included.\n\n1448\n01:11:54,888 --> 01:11:59,638\nWith Windows, it is a free install.\n\n1449\n01:11:59,638 --> 01:12:05,426\nAnd what we'll do is we'll go in here and\n\n1450\n01:12:05,426 --> 01:12:08,843\n[NOISE] the Windows ADK.\n\n1451\n01:12:08,843 --> 01:12:13,126\nAnd since we are on 8.1,\nwe will go 8.1 and\n\n1452\n01:12:13,126 --> 01:12:17,480\nthis guy right there, at the very top.\n\n1453\n01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,290\nThe Windows assessment and deployment kit.\n\n1454\n01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:22,320\nNow it's total is like five gigs or\n\n1455\n01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,230\nsomething with all the tools\nincluded in there.\n\n1456\n01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:26,680\nIt is pretty big.\n\n1457\n01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,970\n>> Nice easy download.\n\n1458\n01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:28,670\n>> Nice easy download.\n\n1459\n01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:32,620\nIt does come with some neat stuff like the\napplication compatibility toolkit which I\n\n1460\n01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:35,590\nthink most of these things\nwe will get into later.\n\n1461\n01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:38,310\nThe USMT I think we get into.\n\n1462\n01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:42,340\nAnd performance toolkit, assessment\ntoolkit, assessment services, and\n\n1463\n01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:46,350\nfinally at the very bottom\nthe Windows pre-installation worm.\n\n1464\n01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,218\nI call it pre-execution.\n\n1465\n01:12:48,218 --> 01:12:52,220\nPre-installation environment,\nthat is the Windows PE.\n\n1466\n01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,950\nSo before the show it does\ntake a while to download.\n\n1467\n01:12:55,950 --> 01:13:00,720\nI did download this thing before and\ninstalled it, and so\n\n1468\n01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,990\nwe got it all installed and\nwe are ready to move forward.\n\n1469\n01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:08,575\nNow to begin building\na Windows PE toolkit, or\n\n1470\n01:13:08,575 --> 01:13:12,700\nWindows PE disk, we will run or find cmd.\n\n1471\n01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:17,540\nAll right, it's the Deployment and\nImaging Tools Environment.\n\n1472\n01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:21,610\nSo you have to use this command prompt to\nlaunch it and Don, wasn't there something\n\n1473\n01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:25,200\nthat we had to launch from\na special command pump like this?\n\n1474\n01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,580\nThat thing that happened yesterday?\n\n1475\n01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:31,960\n>> Shoot there was the server\nrole migration utilities,\n\n1476\n01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,200\nthat was in the server show,\nbut yeah, same thing.\n\n1477\n01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:38,240\n>> All right, let me just bump\nthis up Don so I can be like you.\n\n1478\n01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,185\n>> Gotta go with the big fonts.\n\n1479\n01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:43,472\n>> All right, so there we go.\n\n1480\n01:13:43,472 --> 01:13:44,050\nAll right, so\n\n1481\n01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:49,402\nit's a quick couple of commands to\nstart this guy once we're up in there.\n\n1482\n01:13:49,402 --> 01:13:52,960\nAll right, so it is copype and\n\n1483\n01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,480\nthen the architecture of what\nwe're going to be using it with.\n\n1484\n01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:59,628\nWe will be using it on a 64-bit so it's a-\n>> How do you spell copype?\n\n1485\n01:13:59,628 --> 01:14:00,726\n>> What?\n\n1486\n01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:03,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know.\n\n1487\n01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:08,185\nUnder these lights I get really flushed\nand nervous under these lights every time.\n\n1488\n01:14:08,185 --> 01:14:08,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1489\n01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,760\nAnd then we just need to\nfind a place to stick it.\n\n1490\n01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,130\nAnd I would just call it winpe.\n\n1491\n01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:15,960\nAll right.\n\n1492\n01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,250\nIt goes very fast.\n\n1493\n01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:22,810\nAnd it's taking all the files that we're\ngonna need to build it, and there it is.\n\n1494\n01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:26,910\nSo we'll browse over there and\njust take a peek at it.\n\n1495\n01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:29,314\nWindows pe and there it is.\n\n1496\n01:14:29,314 --> 01:14:30,254\nPretty fun stuff.\n\n1497\n01:14:30,254 --> 01:14:34,065\nAll right, so from this point\nright here we can compile it and\n\n1498\n01:14:34,065 --> 01:14:38,390\nput it on a USB drive,\nwe can make an ISO out of it and burn it.\n\n1499\n01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:42,680\nWhat we will do with this\nis make a ISO out of it and\n\n1500\n01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,450\nthen we'll mount it up\nin a virtual machine.\n\n1501\n01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:51,940\nAnd so that one is makewinpemedia and\nwe are going to\n\n1502\n01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:58,450\nmake an ISO and winpe,\nthat's where the thing is.\n\n1503\n01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:01,591\nAnd then we need to name it something.\n\n1504\n01:15:01,591 --> 01:15:05,990\nWhere the files are, winpe, and\n\n1505\n01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:11,029\nthen we'll just call it wnepe.iso.\n\n1506\n01:15:11,029 --> 01:15:15,320\nWe'll run this guy right there and\nyep, runs very fast.\n\n1507\n01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:20,162\nAnd once this guy is completed, we should\nhave an ISO file that we can use to\n\n1508\n01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:24,740\nmount and install stuff and boom,\nthere that guy is right there.\n\n1509\n01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:29,240\n>> Let me just inject real quick, so\nyou did slash ISO to create that cd image.\n\n1510\n01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:34,470\nYou can also use slash ufd to\ncreate a USB bootable media.\n\n1511\n01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,650\nSo if you just wanna boot off\na USB key you can do that.\n\n1512\n01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:42,035\nIf you're like me and can't remember\nthe last time you had a blank DVD in hand,\n\n1513\n01:15:42,035 --> 01:15:43,371\nthat's pretty handy.\n\n1514\n01:15:43,371 --> 01:15:48,680\n>> Yeah before the show I was\ngonna put it on a USB device and\n\n1515\n01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:56,081\nit kept throwing out an error every\nsingle time, so I just didn't go ahead.\n\n1516\n01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:58,920\n>> Well for use in a virtual\nmachine like you're doing,\n\n1517\n01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,930\nan ISO is really the way to go so\nthat's fine.\n\n1518\n01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:06,860\nBut in real life if you need a USB\nbootable device then you can do that.\n\n1519\n01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:13,230\n>> So now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna fire up the Google Hyper-V and\n\n1520\n01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:17,385\nthere is a machine right here, there's\nno OS or anything installed on this guy.\n\n1521\n01:16:17,385 --> 01:16:23,360\nWe're gonna fire this guy up and we'll\nget into the settings in the DVD drive.\n\n1522\n01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:28,358\nWe'll go ahead and\nmount that ISO that we just burned or\n\n1523\n01:16:28,358 --> 01:16:31,300\nmade cuz that guy will apply it.\n\n1524\n01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,772\nOkay, and we'll start this guy up.\n\n1525\n01:16:33,772 --> 01:16:38,018\n[NOISE]\n>> So\n\n1526\n01:16:38,018 --> 01:16:41,280\nthere's no OS on here right now, so\nit's just gonna boot from that ISO.\n\n1527\n01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:45,020\n>> And yeah, so once this guy boots up,\n\n1528\n01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:48,462\nthen we'll see this\nawesomeness PE environment.\n\n1529\n01:16:48,462 --> 01:16:51,680\n>> Yeah and now Windows PE is really,\nreally small, so\n\n1530\n01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:55,970\nit doesn't have a full crazy\nGUI like you might be used to.\n\n1531\n01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:57,300\nIt gets this.\n\n1532\n01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,230\n>> Let me upgrade,\nmake this font a little bit larger.\n\n1533\n01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:03,862\n>> Upgrade with two Ds?\n\n1534\n01:17:03,862 --> 01:17:06,553\n>> Don.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1535\n01:17:06,553 --> 01:17:07,156\n>> All right, so there we go.\n\n1536\n01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:07,818\nWoo!\n\n1537\n01:17:07,818 --> 01:17:09,049\nLook at all these fireworks.\n\n1538\n01:17:09,049 --> 01:17:13,709\nNow that's really all it does,\nis it dumps us to this command prompt and\n\n1539\n01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:17,284\nthen from here,\nDon this does look really familiar for\n\n1540\n01:17:17,284 --> 01:17:21,810\nwhen you launched some command\nwindow from the installation media.\n\n1541\n01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:24,838\nI mean, this is it.\n\n1542\n01:17:24,838 --> 01:17:25,476\nHere it is.\n\n1543\n01:17:25,476 --> 01:17:30,041\n>> Yeah, when you boot off of a Windows\n8 DVD, it's actually booting Windows PE,\n\n1544\n01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:34,021\nit's booting that smaller version\nof Windows and you do the install.\n\n1545\n01:17:34,021 --> 01:17:37,330\nThe only difference is they've added\nthe GUI for the installer to it.\n\n1546\n01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:41,010\nWith the PE disk that Nate just built,\nit just doesn't have that installer on it.\n\n1547\n01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:42,650\nSo he's dropping that command prompt.\n\n1548\n01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:45,480\nAnd all the tools you'd\nexpect to have are there, so\n\n1549\n01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,300\nyou have like disk part and things.\n\n1550\n01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,010\nIs DISM in there by default?\n\n1551\n01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:52,830\nI don't know if it is or not.\n\n1552\n01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:54,900\nIt is, yeah.\n\n1553\n01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,641\nSo now he can use DISM to take an image or\napply an image.\n\n1554\n01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:01,629\nRemember I mentioned that in the last\nseminar, I said hey, if you really wanna\n\n1555\n01:18:01,629 --> 01:18:04,001\ntake an image of a system the best\nway to do is booting off a DVD.\n\n1556\n01:18:04,001 --> 01:18:06,879\nThat way you know none of the files are in\nuse and the system's offline, clean and\n\n1557\n01:18:06,879 --> 01:18:08,080\nyou can take that image.\n\n1558\n01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,640\nSo very, very handy to do it.\n\n1559\n01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:13,440\nAnd if you're deploying an image on a\nblank machine, there is no OS to boot to,\n\n1560\n01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:17,510\nso you gotta boot from something,\nthe Windows PE disk is the way to go.\n\n1561\n01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,710\nSo it's right here.\n\n1562\n01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:22,480\nYou can add more to Windows PE\nif you want, right?\n\n1563\n01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,540\nSo if you have other software or\nother things that you need,\n\n1564\n01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:29,720\nunattended installation scripts, things\nlike that, they can go right in here and\n\n1565\n01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,910\nbecome part of that Windows PE\nenvironment and be available to you.\n\n1566\n01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:35,310\nIn fact, there's a lot of\namateur products out there or\n\n1567\n01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,760\nprojects out there where people\nare doing just that, right?\n\n1568\n01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,190\nNate, have you ever worked with BartPE?\n\n1569\n01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,315\n>> I have not.\n\n1570\n01:18:42,315 --> 01:18:45,340\n>> Well, bring up my computer real quick.\n\n1571\n01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:49,940\nBartPE has been around a long time and\nbasically, what it is is a guy,\n\n1572\n01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:52,070\nwho I assume is named Bart.\n\n1573\n01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:57,290\nIt would be awkward if he wasn't, but\nhe basically said, I wanna create\n\n1574\n01:18:57,290 --> 01:19:02,500\nthe ultimate Windows PE disk, and that's\nexactly what he did is he took it and\n\n1575\n01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:08,140\nit's basically Windows PE, but he's\nadded a bunch of other software to it.\n\n1576\n01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:12,780\nAnd so he just goes on and rambles about\nall the different stuff that it can do,\n\n1577\n01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:16,840\nbut basically you build a Windows PE\ndisk using your Windows disk.\n\n1578\n01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,180\nHe does not provide you with Windows.\n\n1579\n01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:21,210\nHe can't legally do that, but\nthen he's got all these additions.\n\n1580\n01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:24,860\nSo he has this little program that'll\ncreate unintended installations, scripts,\n\n1581\n01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,310\nand all sorts of really neat and\npowerful things.\n\n1582\n01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:30,300\nAnd its all just a,\nI don't want to call it an amateur\n\n1583\n01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,910\nproject cuz a lot of people use it,\nbut you'll see things like that.\n\n1584\n01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:36,137\nThere's also, what's the other one?\n\n1585\n01:19:36,137 --> 01:19:40,030\nIt's like Ultimate Boot CD or\nsomething like that?\n\n1586\n01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,430\nIs this the one?\n\n1587\n01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:47,270\nYes.\nSo this is another one that boots up and\n\n1588\n01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:50,680\nit has a ton of utilities that\nsome are Linux based, but\n\n1589\n01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,816\nsome cause it to launch\na Windows PE environment.\n\n1590\n01:19:53,816 --> 01:20:00,694\nAnd you see that somewhere in here,\nwell I guess maybe they don't show it.\n\n1591\n01:20:00,694 --> 01:20:01,588\nBut some of these utilities do.\n\n1592\n01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:04,140\n>> Yeah wasn't there some rescue cds or\n\n1593\n01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:09,506\nwhat not that we're having to use before,\nand to like for backups and stuff.\n\n1594\n01:20:09,506 --> 01:20:11,549\n>> Yeah.\n\n1595\n01:20:11,549 --> 01:20:12,303\nParagon.\n\n1596\n01:20:12,303 --> 01:20:16,681\n>> And it ended up being\na custom type of Windows PE.\n\n1597\n01:20:16,681 --> 01:20:21,097\n>> Yeah, paragon disk back up or\nbackup in recovery, right there, this guy,\n\n1598\n01:20:21,097 --> 01:20:25,940\nwhen you boot up of it, it is a windows PE\ndisc that runs their backup software also.\n\n1599\n01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:29,330\nSo, you can customize these to\ndo all sorts of crazy things,\n\n1600\n01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:34,190\nit's a very stripped down version of\nwindows that is really unlicensed.\n\n1601\n01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:37,670\nYou don't have to pay for a license to\nuse Windows PE cuz it's not a full OS.\n\n1602\n01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:39,190\nMicrosoft makes that available.\n\n1603\n01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:44,110\nYou do need a licensed copy of\nWindows to create the disk.\n\n1604\n01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:47,520\nBut then after that, you can run it,\nand use your own software.\n\n1605\n01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,510\nSo, it's cool.stuff.\n\n1606\n01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:50,270\n>> Yeah.\n\n1607\n01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:51,930\n>> But-\n>> Definitely cool.\n\n1608\n01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:56,530\nAnd so creating this Windows PE disk and\n\n1609\n01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:59,370\nfiring up this virtual machine\njust to remind you that I\n\n1610\n01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:03,810\nam still running everything off\nof this Windows To Go drive.\n\n1611\n01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:06,620\nThis little guy right here, and yeah.\n\n1612\n01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,970\nSo it's, yeah, maybe I'll keep it around.\n\n1613\n01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:11,420\nMaybe I'll use it.\n\n1614\n01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:16,400\n>> So one of the implementations I've seen\nfor this was where, it was an organization\n\n1615\n01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:21,430\nwhere basically what they did was they\ncreated these 64 gig USB flash keys,\n\n1616\n01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:22,890\njust thumb drives.\n\n1617\n01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:27,880\nAnd they made them bootable windows\nPE disc, and they had a WIM file,\n\n1618\n01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:31,320\nan image of their reference desktop,\nand they\n\n1619\n01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:36,530\nput the WIM file on that USB key along\nwith windows PE and they wrote a script..\n\n1620\n01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:39,310\nSo that if you booted\na machine off of that USB key,\n\n1621\n01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:43,070\nit automatically erased it and\ndropped the reference image on there.\n\n1622\n01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:46,200\nAnd so all of their helpdesk\nemployees carried one of those, so\n\n1623\n01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,100\nif they ever went to a machine and\nthey couldn't fix a problem on it, if they\n\n1624\n01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:53,560\nhad a virus or whatever, they just popped\nin that USB key and rebooted the machine.\n\n1625\n01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,410\nIt would wipe the machine,\ndrop the reference image on there and\n\n1626\n01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:59,060\nthen you have a clean install.\n\n1627\n01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:01,748\nThen you'd pop out the usb key and\nwalk away.\n\n1628\n01:22:01,748 --> 01:22:04,800\nSo, that is the type of thing\nthat you can create with this.\n\n1629\n01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,390\nCreating custom images, that are\ncustomized to meet your companies needs.\n\n1630\n01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:13,230\nAnd using things like Windows PE to\nboot and then DISM to deploy it.\n\n1631\n01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:16,365\nIf you write that into a script,\nif you automate that,\n\n1632\n01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:19,992\nit can be as simple as plugging in a key,\nstarting up and going.\n\n1633\n01:22:19,992 --> 01:22:24,934\nAnd they call that a light touch\ninstallation, or an LTI, ZTI, and\n\n1634\n01:22:24,934 --> 01:22:27,117\nLTI and all these crazy ones.\n\n1635\n01:22:27,117 --> 01:22:28,865\nBut it's where basically\nyou just plug in a key.\n\n1636\n01:22:28,865 --> 01:22:30,245\nThat's the light touch.\n\n1637\n01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:31,585\nEverything else is done automatically.\n\n1638\n01:22:31,585 --> 01:22:32,250\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n1639\n01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,765\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1640\n01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:36,590\nSo Don let met just ask you this,\nI'll just throw it out there.\n\n1641\n01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:38,940\nSo, since I'm running off\nthis Windows To-Go drive,\n\n1642\n01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:42,230\ndo you know what happens if I\nunplug it from my computer?\n\n1643\n01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,670\n>> I don't.\n\n1644\n01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:45,000\n>> Do you have any guesses?\n\n1645\n01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,803\n>> No, have you ever done it?\n\n1646\n01:22:45,803 --> 01:22:46,716\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1647\n01:22:46,716 --> 01:22:49,158\nWell, I read about it.\n\n1648\n01:22:49,158 --> 01:22:53,460\n>> [LAUGH] I've never disconnected\na USB Drive while the OS is running.\n\n1649\n01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:54,500\n>> You wanna see what happens?\n\n1650\n01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,119\n>> Sure, what the heck.\n\n1651\n01:22:56,490 --> 01:23:01,070\nAll right, so supposedly what should\nhappen so it is disconnected, all right.\n\n1652\n01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:05,939\nNow, what's going to happen is\nthat it will freeze a [INAUDIBLE]\n\n1653\n01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:06,505\n>> No it froze.\n\n1654\n01:23:06,505 --> 01:23:08,060\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1655\n01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:11,031\n>> So you have 60 seconds until the whole\n\n1656\n01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:13,640\nthing just goes to crap.\n\n1657\n01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:17,480\nSo I'll plug this guy back in and what\nshould happen is it should automatically\n\n1658\n01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:22,710\nresume, probably the screencasting\nsoftware I want to fire back up.\n\n1659\n01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:26,490\nLet me see if I can start that.\n\n1660\n01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:28,310\n>> So it'll run for\n60 seconds and then what,\n\n1661\n01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,860\nit basically like hibernates or something?\n\n1662\n01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:30,758\n>> There it goes.\n\n1663\n01:23:30,758 --> 01:23:32,850\n>> [LAUGH] Then it gripes at you.\n\n1664\n01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:35,585\nPlease keep the drive\nplugged in you moron.\n\n1665\n01:23:35,585 --> 01:23:36,940\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1666\n01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:39,280\nSo you get 60 seconds.\n\n1667\n01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,320\nAnd so yeah, Windows, it'll just freeze.\n\n1668\n01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,890\nAnd hang tight, wait for\nthat drive to get back in.\n\n1669\n01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:49,430\nAfter the 60 seconds the host\ncomputer will just power down.\n\n1670\n01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:53,020\nAnd you could potentially corrupt\neverything on your Windows To Go device.\n\n1671\n01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:55,370\n>> So you don't want to do that.\n\n1672\n01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:57,560\n>> Nope.\nBut it does if you're unplugged or\n\n1673\n01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:00,450\nif you need to like quickly do something.\n\n1674\n01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:02,270\nI don't know, but, yeah, so there you go.\n\n1675\n01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,035\n>> Smart to wait until the end\nof the show to try that one.\n\n1676\n01:24:04,035 --> 01:24:07,694\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, well Nate I think we wrapped\n\n1677\n01:24:07,694 --> 01:24:10,780\nup this set of objectives,\ncan you think of anything we left out?\n\n1678\n01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,340\n>> No.\n\n1679\n01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:19,000\nIf something does pop up I'm sure it\nwill slip stream it in like updates into\n\n1680\n01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,276\nother stuff.\n\n1681\n01:24:20,276 --> 01:24:23,750\n>> And you mentioned like the application\ncompatibility tool kit and stuff,\n\n1682\n01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:26,090\nthose are gonna be in\nour very next episode so\n\n1683\n01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:29,240\ndefinitely stay tuned for those\n>> As we move

right, good evening,\ngood afternoon, and good morning.\n\n5\n00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,020\nI am Nathan Copeland, here with Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,820\n>> How you doing, man?\n\n7\n00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,620\n>> Doing very well.\n\n8\n00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,690\n>> Good, good, good, good.\n\n9\n00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,120\n>> Here for\nanother exciting episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n10\n00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,040\nToday we've got the Windows 8,\nthe 7688 exam objectives today.\n\n11\n00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,600\n>> That's right.\n\n12\n00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,780\n>> And-\n>> Supporting desktop apps.\n\n13\n00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,769\nThe fun stuff when you get all those help\ndesk calls because applications don't\n\n14\n00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,403\nseem to work and everybody goes,\nI don't like the new operating system.\n\n15\n00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:07,957\nCan't we go back to the days of 311?\n\n16\n00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:09,257\nNo.\nNope, sorry.\n\n17\n00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:10,790\n>> We've got to move on.\n\n18\n00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,980\nIt's the future, and it's actually,\nit's great, actually.\n\n19\n00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,530\nIt's fantastic, you know?\n\n20\n00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,300\nWindows 8 oh, what were you going to say?\n\n21\n00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,580\n>> I was gonna say, some of the technology\ndrive really, really impressive.\n\n22\n00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,950\nAnd we're gonna talk\nabout some of that today.\n\n23\n00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,610\n>> Yeah.\nWe got some exciting stuff lined up today.\n\n24\n00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,930\nThe official exam objectives,\n\n25\n00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,430\nif I have browse over to these officially,\nright quick.\n\n26\n00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,610\n>> There we go.\n\n27\n00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,430\n>> We've got desktop app compatibility\nusing application compatibility took kit.\n\n28\n00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,733\nAnd Wes you'll be showing\nthat one off today.\n\n29\n00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,250\n>> Yes.\n\n30\n00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,680\nExciting stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,371\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n32\n00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:53,696\nWe've got desktop application coexistence,\nwith Hyper-V, RemoteApp and App-V.\n\n33\n00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:57,996\nRemoteApp and\nAppV are these enterprise solutions for\n\n34\n00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:00,920\nthis application coexistence.\n\n35\n00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,330\nPretty heavy stuff.\n\n36\n00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,720\n>> It really is, and it's one of those\nthings that, when it comes down to it,\n\n37\n00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,120\nif we've got multiple applications and\nthe different versions,\n\n38\n00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,730\nhow do we get these to play nice?\n\n39\n00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,800\nMaybe you have one application that's, for\n\n40\n00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,078\ninstance, is a line of business\napplication that you need to support.\n\n41\n00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:19,608\nBut it moves into a different version and\nyou want to test out the version, but\n\n42\n00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:23,356\nagain with these different versioning\nconflicts we can have they don't play nice\n\n43\n00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:25,713\ntogether and\nit's one of the things that we can do.\n\n44\n00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:30,846\nAnother thing that we can do here too\nis how we have a user experience that\n\n45\n00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:35,810\ncrosses multiple devices,\nmultiple devices I think we're going to\n\n46\n00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,510\nbe talking talking about something called,\nwhat is it called?\n\n47\n00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,190\nUEV today.\n\n48\n00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,350\n>> Yeah,\nthe user experience virtualization.\n\n49\n00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,460\nPretty neat way to sync your\nsettings across devices.\n\n50\n00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,190\n>> I think Microsoft says something\nlike providing a consistent user\n\n51\n00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,420\nexperience across multiple platforms.\n\n52\n00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,680\nI think I could sell that one.\n\n53\n00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,640\n>> No that's good.\n\n54\n00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,550\nEven I want to use it now.\n\n55\n00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,300\n>> Aim higher man.\n\n56\n00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,530\n>> What?\n>> Aim higher, set your sights here.\n\n57\n00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,440\n>> Oh.\n\n58\n00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,310\nAnd rounding everything up.\n\n59\n00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,170\nWe've got deploy desktop\napps using Windows Intune.\n\n60\n00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,710\nNow we haven't quite looked\nat Windows Intune yet.\n\n61\n00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,800\nWell, we have sort of, but\nthat was kinda like past stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,040\nBut so Windows Intune,\na cloud based management for\n\n63\n00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,260\nWindows devices, mobile devices, and\nthat, it's some really amazing technology.\n\n64\n00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,560\nToday, we'll just get into\ndeploying desktop apps with it.\n\n65\n00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,050\nLater on the objectives.\n\n66\n00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,086\nIt's kinda later on I think\ndown near the bottom.\n\n67\n00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:49,390\nDown there in 3.4 we'll get\ninto like just the meat.\n\n68\n00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,500\n>> How do I control the devices?\n\n69\n00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,870\nWe gotta be, as admins,\nwe want control right.\n\n70\n00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,750\nHow do we take control of a mobile device?\n\n71\n00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,170\nWe can control devices when\nthey're on our networks,\n\n72\n00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,470\nwell what happens when that\ndevice leaves our networks.\n\n73\n00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,390\nCan we still maintain\na certain level of control?\n\n74\n00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,210\nCan we still deploy applications out to,\nwhich you're gonna see today,\n\n75\n00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,340\nout to a mobile device when\nit's not on our networks?\n\n76\n00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,290\nAnd think that's one of the things\nthat makes Intune pretty exciting.\n\n77\n00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,350\nI have to say when I first looked at it,\nI was like oh,\n\n78\n00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,040\nwhat's this Cloud based technology, just\nanother service that you've gotta pay for.\n\n79\n00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,800\nAnd then of course when I got into it,\nand started learning about it,\n\n80\n00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,960\nI was like, this is really cool.\n\n81\n00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,140\nThe fact that I could\ntake a mobile device, and\n\n82\n00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,620\nthis'll come in in managing the clients,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,830\nWhere I can schedule an anti-virus scan.\n\n84\n00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,500\nDon't even have to call the end user,\n\n85\n00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,560\njust randomly they see the little\ncircle spinning in their task bar.\n\n86\n00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,160\nAnd all of a sudden we're\ndoing an anti malware scan\n\n87\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,958\non their device without them\nactually having to initiate it.\n\n88\n00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,060\n>> Yeah, sweet stuff.\n\n89\n00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,300\nSo all that is to come when it's Intune.\n\n90\n00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,630\nToday we're just focusing\non that one part.\n\n91\n00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,300\nAlmost a little backwards.\n\n92\n00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,600\nYou'd want to get it in tune first.\n\n93\n00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,437\nAnd then see desktop app.\n>> Yeah.\n\n94\n00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,280\n>> But there's a way to categorize it.\n\n95\n00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,207\nSporting apps together.\n\n96\n00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:08,522\nI guess they're gonna put a little,\nIntune can do multiple things here, and\n\n97\n00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,975\nyou're gonna see that as you\ngo through the objectives.\n\n98\n00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:15,465\nThey put some of the features of\nIntune throughout the objectives just\n\n99\n00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:19,590\ncause of the different strategies\nthat you can employ using it.\n\n100\n00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,540\n>> So, I guess, so\nwhy don't we just kick this guy off.\n\n101\n00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,475\n>> Okay.\n>> And we'll get in with an app\n\n102\n00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:28,850\nco-existence and app compatibility.\n\n103\n00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,520\n>> Definitely.\n\n104\n00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,230\n>> Now let me ask you this.\n\n105\n00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,494\nSo you use Windows 8, right?\n\n106\n00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:35,049\n8 or 8.1?\n\n107\n00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:35,590\n>> 8.1.\n>> Okay.\n\n108\n00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,130\n>> I've upgraded.\n\n109\n00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,020\nWell, I've got 8 8 and I've got 8.1.\n\n110\n00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,680\nI haven't upgraded my desktop,\nso I'm falling behind the times.\n\n111\n00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,165\nI'm already an operating system behind.\n\n112\n00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:48,100\n[LAUGH]\n>> So let me ask you, have you run into,\n\n113\n00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,390\njust your regular browsing computer use,\n\n114\n00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,570\nhave you run into an app that\ndoes not work on Windows 8?\n\n115\n00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,960\n>> Well with some of the apps,\n\n116\n00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,770\nthe only one that I've really run into\nthat I can't get to work right is\n\n117\n00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,080\nnative to the operating system itself,\nand that's Internet Explorer.\n\n118\n00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,660\nAnd now I don't have any idea at this\npoint if that's actually Internet Explorer\n\n119\n00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,830\nor some discompatability with some of the\nexisting settings that it might be looking\n\n120\n00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,450\nfor on certain webpages,\nbut that's about it.\n\n121\n00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,480\nI really haven't found anything that's\nnot compatible, outside of some drivers\n\n122\n00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,800\nhere and there, that we don't\nrecognize the hardware devices, but so\n\n123\n00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360\nfar, so good with the applications.\n\n124\n00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,280\nHow about you?\n\n125\n00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,870\n>> Yeah you, not really.\n\n126\n00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:35,230\nPreparing for this stuff I was\ndigging through my computer and trying\n\n127\n00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:41,470\nto think what do I have that I know that\nis broken that I need to do something?\n\n128\n00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,700\nI suppose it would get into more\nline of business type apps,\n\n129\n00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,620\ncustom apps things that I guess maybe\nnot that I don't receive the updates,\n\n130\n00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,180\nor new revisions, or\nwhatnot that can kinda get locked in.\n\n131\n00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,160\nAnd those apps are critical\nto some businesses.\n\n132\n00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,705\n>> That is, yep.\n\n133\n00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:04,375\nAnd I guess they have to\nbring those guys with them.\n\n134\n00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:08,305\n>> Yeah, you might have an application\nthat maybe I purchased in the days of XP,\n\n135\n00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:11,485\nand it's a line of business\napplication just like Nate said, and\n\n136\n00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,177\nmaybe the software developer's\ngone out of business.\n\n137\n00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:15,467\nBut the application works good.\n\n138\n00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,177\nYou just can't get any additional\nlicensing information, and\n\n139\n00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:19,647\nyou can't afford to lose your settings.\n\n140\n00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,427\nYou can't afford to lose the app.\n\n141\n00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:26,350\nAnd we're moving on to different operating\nsystems there's no more support for it.\n\n142\n00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,240\nWell how can you bring that line of\nbusiness application that maybe your\n\n143\n00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,820\nbusiness is contingent on,\ninto the new operating system,\n\n144\n00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,210\nstill support all the older features and\nstill be able to run natively.\n\n145\n00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,610\nI guess it wouldn't be natively,\n\n146\n00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,910\nbecause that's what\nthe compatibility testers are for.\n\n147\n00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,240\nBut have it run within\nthe new environment.\n\n148\n00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,590\nIn an environment that it was\nreally was never programmed to and\n\n149\n00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,530\nthat's where some of these mitigations,\n\n150\n00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,150\nif you will, application compatibility\nfixers come in to place.\n\n151\n00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,314\nSo, the first tool that we'll\nlook at today is the application\n\n153\n00:07:58,314 --> 00:08:00,210\ncompatibility tool kit.\n\n154\n00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,840\nAnd, Wes,\nyou've got this guy all installed up-\n\n155\n00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,500\n>> Yes.\n\n156\n00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,420\n>> And ready to go?\n\n157\n00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,945\n>> Now one of the things that\nyou've got to keep in mind, and\n\n158\n00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:13,719\nwe did this Prior to the episode starting,\nbecause it does take a little bit,\n\n159\n00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:17,392\nis that if you don't have .NET 3.5,\njust a framework,\n\n160\n00:08:17,392 --> 00:08:22,670\nif you don't have that installed on your\nmachine prior, when you install the ACT.\n\n161\n00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,160\nThe application compatibility toolkit,\nit's gonna ask you,\n\n162\n00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,650\ndo you want to go out, and\ndo you want to install the .NET framework?\n\n163\n00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,950\nSo I've already gone ahead and did that,\njust to save a little bit of time.\n\n164\n00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,630\nAnother thing that you have that is not\nnative to the Application Compatibility\n\n165\n00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,200\nToolkit is something known\nas the Application Verifier.\n\n166\n00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,880\nAnd it comes in 32-bit, 64-bit.\n\n167\n00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,760\nAnd it will also prompt you\nduring the installation of\n\n168\n00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,330\nApplication Compatibility Toolkit\nsaying hey, you need this application.\n\n169\n00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,680\nI don't know if it'll say hey.\n\n170\n00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,750\nBut it'll say you need\nthis application verifier.\n\n171\n00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,070\nDo you want us to go ahead and\ndownload the required software?\n\n172\n00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,010\nActually, I take that back.\n\n173\n00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,410\nThis one doesn't actually download,\nit takes you out to the website.\n\n174\n00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,170\nIt makes you push download.\n\n175\n00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,030\nSo we've already got that already set up.\n\n176\n00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,170\nIt's ready to go and if you look,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n177\n00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,400\npush our start button here to\nget us back to our Start screen.\n\n178\n00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,080\nAnd them I'm gonna go ahead,\ndown here on the bottom,\n\n179\n00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,880\nI'm gonna choose this down arrow\nto show all the applications.\n\n180\n00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,110\nAnd you can see some of\nthe different things that are here.\n\n181\n00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,380\nAgain, this application verifier\nwas installed with ACT.\n\n182\n00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,870\nYou can see here, we have\nthe application compatibility manager.\n\n183\n00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,736\nYou'll see the app compatibility\nadministrator and both.\n\n184\n00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:33,790\nFor 32-bit and 64-bit,\nif I hover to discover here.\n\n185\n00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,580\nYou can see the 64-bit.\n\n186\n00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,630\nInternet Explorer settings.\n\n187\n00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,390\nWe're talking about maybe Internet\nExplorer is expecting maybe a newer,\n\n188\n00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,260\nrefined set of whatever specifications and\nit's not finding that.\n\n189\n00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,630\nWell, there's ways to test\nInternet Explorer as well.\n\n190\n00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,460\nAnd then we've got two here.\n\n191\n00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,550\nThe last ones, this is the SUA,\nthrow you some acronyms here.\n\n192\n00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,660\nStandard User Analyzer.\n\n193\n00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,090\nAnd then there's\na Standard User Analyzer Wizard.\n\n194\n00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:03,530\nSo, again, if you want to follow the\nwizard, you can go with the wizard here.\n\n195\n00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,100\nYou want to go head and maybe start\ndemonstrating the standard user\n\n196\n00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,460\nanalyzer here, and some of\nthe application compatibility fixes?\n\n197\n00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,562\n>> What?\nOh.\n\n198\n00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:16,550\n>> All right, so do you want us to go\nahead and start those and install those?\n\n199\n00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,058\n>> Sorry [CROSSTALK] just something,\nyou caught me in a daydream.\n\n200\n00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:19,802\n>> Oh, that's okay.\n\n201\n00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,531\n[LAUGH] Welcome to my world.\n\n202\n00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:24,748\n[LAUGH]\n>> Of all the times.\n\n203\n00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:28,204\n>> So we're going to go ahead, and what\nwe're gonna do is demonstrate this line of\n\n204\n00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:31,730\nbusiness application that is not gonna\nplay nice with our new operating system.\n\n205\n00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,875\nWell, we say that,\nhopefully it's not going to play nice.\n\n206\n00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,140\nSo now you see,\n\n207\n00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,320\nit's starting to let us know that\nhey we need a privilege escalation.\n\n208\n00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,860\nAnd that's one thing to keep in mind with\nthe application compatibility toolkit.\n\n209\n00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,870\nThis really was a big deal when we move\nfrom XP, and we moved into Vista, and\n\n210\n00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,330\nthen Vista keeps that architecture.\n\n211\n00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,070\nIt's something known as\nthe Standard User Security Architecture.\n\n212\n00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,120\nIn the days of Vista,\na lot of the, well the majority\n\n213\n00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,880\nof the first user accounts that\nwere created with a default admin.\n\n214\n00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,410\nWhich means any software that\nyou installed including viruses\n\n215\n00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,450\nran in the context of an administrator.\n\n216\n00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,740\nNow, applications that were programmed for\n\n217\n00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,040\nthe days of XP were expecting\nto run as administrators and\n\n218\n00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,470\nyou can see an example of that right here\non your screen that this is saying hey,\n\n219\n00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,700\nyou need to run this with elevated\nprivileges and a lot of times it has\n\n220\n00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,520\nto deal with because it's gonna start\nwriting some keys to the registry,\n\n221\n00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,080\nand creating registry values in\nthere when it goes to install.\n\n222\n00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,980\nNow if I close this down or say OK,\n\n223\n00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,700\neither way, you're going to notice that\nthe applications still going to run and\n\n224\n00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,110\nwe might think well guess what,\neverything looks to be okay.\n\n225\n00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,930\nBut this is where application\ncompatibility fixes come in\n\n226\n00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,600\nbecause you'll see if I start to click\non some of the fields on here like for\n\n227\n00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,070\ninstance clicking trends.\n\n228\n00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,530\nYou're gonna notice it's saying, wait\na second, we can't create this object.\n\n229\n00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,890\nWe'll go ahead and try a couple more,\npoints in this interface.\n\n230\n00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,000\nIf I go to Tools and\nI hit the Options, now,\n\n231\n00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,300\nhere's where we get access to\nthe registry key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.\n\n232\n00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,290\nAgain, what it's trying to do\nis it's trying to gain that\n\n233\n00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,680\nwritable access to the registry and, under\nthat standard user security architecture,\n\n234\n00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,790\nstandard users can't write to certain\nprotected portions of the registry.\n\n235\n00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,170\nSo that's what's happening.\n\n236\n00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:22,980\nIt's saying, no.\n\n237\n00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,510\nYou're not running as an administrator.\n\n238\n00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,770\nYou don't get that access.\n\n239\n00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:29,500\nAnd unfortunately, that's causing\nus some compatibility fixes here.\n\n240\n00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,110\nMaybe I wanna update this application.\n\n241\n00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,870\nSo I go over to the Help.\n\n242\n00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,770\nAnd I say Update.\n\n243\n00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,850\nAnd it says uh-uh.\n\n244\n00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,550\nThis is not gonna happen here.\n\n245\n00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,320\nSo you can see that we do have some\nproblems with this application, and\n\n246\n00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,820\nwe're gonna show you a couple different\nways here that we can help to\n\n247\n00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,770\nhopefully eliminate this problem.\n\n248\n00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,110\nWe're gonna use the standard user security\narchitecture, and the good thing is,\n\n249\n00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,602\nexcuse me, standard user.\n\n250\n00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:52,229\n>> Analyzer?\n\n251\n00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,410\n>> Analyzer, thank you.\n\n252\n00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,270\nToo many acronyms here.\n\n253\n00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,090\nSorry, guys.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I was there for that one.\n\n254\n00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,610\n>> Yes, thank you.\n\n255\n00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,795\nI appreciate it, man.\n\n256\n00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:58,479\n[CROSSTALK] Right on cue.\n\n257\n00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,453\nNothing like having a co-pilot.\n\n258\n00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:04,467\n[LAUGH] So, what we're gonna do is, we're\ngonna use the standard user analyzer, and\n\n259\n00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:07,480\nit's gonna watch,\nit's gonna monitor this application, and\n\n260\n00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,567\nit's gonna look at what it's trying to do.\n\n261\n00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:13,849\nAnd it's gonna try to create some possible\nfixes that you're gonna have to be aware\n\n262\n00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:16,340\nof on the test, they're called shims.\n\n263\n00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,720\nShims is just an application\ncompatibility fix that's then applied to\n\n264\n00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,850\nan application that is\ngiving you these prompts,\n\n265\n00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,920\nlike here that say I just don't want to\nplay nice with your new operating system.\n\n266\n00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,010\nSo let's see if we do that.\n\n267\n00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,450\nWe're gonna say continue.\n\n268\n00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,520\nWe're gonna exit out of this application.\n\n269\n00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,750\nNow, I'm just going back\nto our start screen here.\n\n270\n00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,510\nI'm gonna access, because I didn't pin any\nof these to the taskbar I probably could\n\n271\n00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,500\nhave been more efficient and pinned them\nto the task bar, made them available, but\n\n272\n00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,930\nI wasn't on top of that one.\n\n273\n00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,120\nSo I'm not going to use the Wizard,\nwe're gonna use the full program here.\n\n274\n00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,630\nAgain, the Wizard just point and click,\n\n275\n00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,600\nthe intuitive Wizard can run you through\nthis, but we want to see the full blown\n\n276\n00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,920\napplication here and, provided it\nlaunches up, it's thinking about it.\n\n277\n00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,350\nThat may be it needs\nan application compatibility fix.\n\n278\n00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,110\nNow here's your basic interface.\n\n279\n00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,190\nAnd what you'll see here is,\nright here in this column,\n\n280\n00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,890\nbrowse to the location of the application\nthat is in question, and then launch.\n\n281\n00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,470\nNow these few buttons over here.\n\n282\n00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,510\nThese launch options here,\nif I can say it right.\n\n283\n00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,160\nIf you notice, it says elevate.\n\n284\n00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,240\nAll right.\nWhat that's gonna do,\n\n285\n00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,860\nis that's gonna give this\napplication writable access,\n\n286\n00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,280\nor the access that it needs for\nthe registry.\n\n287\n00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,530\nAnd that's not necessarily what we want,\nbecause we want to see what's happening\n\n288\n00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,150\nin its native environment where\nthere is no elevated privileges.\n\n289\n00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,660\nSo the first thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna uncheck that.\n\n290\n00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,690\nWe don't want to elevate.\n\n291\n00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,240\nWe want to see what this does\nunder standard user privileges.\n\n292\n00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,970\nAnother thing here is this\ndisable virtualization.\n\n293\n00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,410\nIf you want to mimic\ncloser to the XP mode.\n\n294\n00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,760\nThe XP experience.\n\n295\n00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,100\nYou're going to want to\ndisable this virtualization.\n\n296\n00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,380\nNow that's again,\na couple steps you take in\n\n297\n00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,980\npreparing the standard user analyzer to\nstart monitoring this application, so\n\n298\n00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,240\nthe next thing that we're going to do is\nwe're going to do a little browsing here.\n\n299\n00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,430\nI'm going to go ahead and go into\nthe location of where the application\n\n300\n00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,160\nthat we're talking about here is.\n\n301\n00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,730\nAnd you'll see it,\nthere it is, stock viewer.\n\n302\n00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,750\nWe're gonna open the executable now.\n\n303\n00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,400\nThe next thing we're gonna do\nis we're gonna launch this.\n\n304\n00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,430\nNow, if you have pre-existing logs,\n\n305\n00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,240\nI didn't want to put the check mark\nin the box here so you can see this.\n\n306\n00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,200\nIf you have existing logs\nthe Application Verifier's gonna say,\n\n307\n00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,400\nhey, if you run this again,\nI'm about to delete these old files.\n\n308\n00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,490\nAre you sure you want to do this.\n\n309\n00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,080\nBecause maybe you've already run this\nagainst an application and you forgot.\n\n310\n00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,980\nI would forget my head if it\nwasnt attached at the neck.\n\n311\n00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,574\nIf you forgot to log the information down,\nit's at least warning you, hey,\n\n312\n00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:46,744\nyou might want to get that information\nbefore I start a new log file.\n\n313\n00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:50,343\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and say yes.\n\n314\n00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:55,540\nAnd it's gonna elevate itself cause\nit's gonna monitor those areas.\n\n315\n00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,110\nAnd you'll see it starts\nto do its thing here.\n\n316\n00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,420\nIt's launching the application for us.\n\n317\n00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,885\nYou're gonna see that we should get,\nthe same experience that we got when\n\n318\n00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:10,210\nwe launched this the first time,\nand we'll say okay.\n\n319\n00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:15,380\nAnd even though we didn't give it those\npermissions, it still launches anyways.\n\n320\n00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,020\nAnd I'm going to do the same thing again.\n\n321\n00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,370\nIt is important that if you are going\nto use the standard user analyzer,\n\n322\n00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,090\nI'll get it right eventually.\n\n323\n00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,910\nIf you use this product,\nyou make sure you mimic\n\n324\n00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,530\nthe same experience that you would\nrunning the application, right?\n\n325\n00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,590\nDon't change the test here.\n\n326\n00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,550\nYou want to find out\nexactly what it's doing.\n\n327\n00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,410\nI'm going to do the same thing.\n\n328\n00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,480\nI'm going to click the Trends\nbutton in this app.\n\n329\n00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,150\nYou're going to see it's\ngoing to do the same thing,\n\n330\n00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,610\nsay sorry, sorry about your luck,\nand choose Tools.\n\n331\n00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,260\nIt's going to try and\naccess that registry or\n\n332\n00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,290\nhive down there, hk classes root for\nfile association.\n\n333\n00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,940\nWe're gonna say continue so\nwe can keep testing this.\n\n334\n00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,520\nAnd again, I'm gonna say help,\ncheck for updates.\n\n335\n00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,380\nAnd again, it's telling me nope,\nsorry, access denied.\n\n336\n00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,764\nThis requires privilege escalation.\n\n337\n00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:08,003\nWe're gonna say continue this and now\nwe're gonna close the application down.\n\n338\n00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:12,467\nIt's important, watch what happens to the\nStandard User Analyzer the moment I close\n\n339\n00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,310\nthe application down.\n\n340\n00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,750\nIt's going to start returning\nwhat it is that it found.\n\n341\n00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,600\nIt's going to see, based on what it found,\n\n342\n00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,930\nif it's got any application\ncompatibility fixes.\n\n343\n00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,760\nSo, we've got a couple here.\n\n344\n00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,470\nYou'll notice if I choose the other tabs,\nand it says down here on the bottom.\n\n345\n00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,240\nIt says choose the other tabs.\n\n346\n00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,720\nIt's just below my, lets see if I can\nmove this out of the task bar area here.\n\n347\n00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,150\nYou'll see, it's kinda hard to see down\nhere, it says now go to the other tabs.\n\n348\n00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,312\nLet's figure out what\nStandard User Analyzer found out.\n\n349\n00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:50,240\nAll right, so I've got a couple here and\nI've got some global name spaces that it's\n\n350\n00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,350\ntrying to write to and\nit said we just can't do this.\n\n351\n00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,370\nSo, if I want to apply this\napplication fix, if I want to test it\n\n352\n00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,510\nlike we're doing here, we're testing\nin a virtualized environment.\n\n353\n00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,510\nIt's probably the same thing that you're\ngonna do when you try to mitigate these\n\n354\n00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,980\napplication compatibilities.\n\n355\n00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,060\nWe're gonna say mitigation.\n\n356\n00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,350\nAnd you notice that it\nsays apply mitigation or\n\n357\n00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,150\nit says export mitigations as an MSI.\n\n358\n00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,720\nMaybe I want to distribute this\nafter the testing if this works.\n\n359\n00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,580\nI wanna distribute this out\nto maybe 500 computers so\n\n360\n00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,150\nthat now my line of\nbusiness application works.\n\n361\n00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,330\nWell I can export this out as an MSI file\nand then use group policy to push this,\n\n362\n00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,330\nagain, to publish this software\nout to the different locations.\n\n363\n00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,320\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay apply mitigation.\n\n364\n00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,970\nAnd it's going to tell me\nthat it's going to apply it.\n\n365\n00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,300\nNow what we're going to see here is\nthat if we rerun this application.\n\n366\n00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,590\nYou're going to start to see\nthat it should apply some fixes.\n\n367\n00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,260\nBut let's find out if it\napplied everything we needed.\n\n368\n00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,550\n>> Almost sounded like\na lead in to something.\n\n369\n00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,880\n>> It might be because I tell you what,\nI don't know that if it fixed everything.\n\n370\n00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,670\nSo it still requiring those\nelevated privileges here.\n\n371\n00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,330\nWe'll say OK.\n\n372\n00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,741\nNow lets see if we've started\nto fix anything really [LAUGH].\n\n373\n00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:13,820\nNow I get something\na little bit different.\n\n374\n00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,490\nWhen I click the Trends app\nI don't get this warning,\n\n375\n00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,540\nyour computer is going to explode and\ndie in 30 seconds just step away from it.\n\n376\n00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,330\nBut it's working now, so\nit did apply that shim.\n\n377\n00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,670\nKeep in mind what a shim is,\njust a compatibility fix.\n\n378\n00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,510\nLet's see how much it did.\n\n379\n00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,410\nLet's go back to our Tools > Options.\n\n380\n00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,370\nOh, unfortunately it\ndidn't apply everything.\n\n381\n00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,410\nWe're gonna say continue.\n\n382\n00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,330\nLet's see, check for updates.\n\n383\n00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,990\nNo, still didn't work.\n\n384\n00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,300\nSo here's where we can\ngo a little bit farther.\n\n385\n00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,280\nIf we know, if I absolutely know,\nmaybe what the fix is,\n\n386\n00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,420\nwe've got something known as\nthe compatibility database.\n\n387\n00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,810\nNow the compatibility database is\nmentioned on the exam objectives,\n\n388\n00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,870\nI believe you mentioned them.\n\n389\n00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,460\nIt says apply using the ACT.\n\n390\n00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,420\nAgain, applying application compatibility\nfixes and I believe the database.\n\n391\n00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,490\n>> Yep, the compatibility database.\n\n392\n00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,840\n>> Now that is in another utility.\n\n393\n00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,370\nSo let's go ahead and close this down,\n\n394\n00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:14,280\nand let's see if we can continue\nto try to fix this problem here.\n\n395\n00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,200\nI'm going to go ahead,\n\n396\n00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,700\nI'm going to export this out as an MSI\nfile just so we save that fix here.\n\n397\n00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,170\nAnd I'm just going to place this\nright here on the desktop and\n\n398\n00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,780\nwe'll call this Stock viewership.\n\n399\n00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,460\nAll right.\nSo now we can close down.\n\n400\n00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,070\nWe make sure that I don't close down\nthe virtual machine [LAUGH] Access denied.\n\n401\n00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,773\nAll right.\nNow we're gonna go back to\n\n402\n00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:44,200\nthe compatibility assistant or\nadministrator.\n\n403\n00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,660\nNo, it says assistant I believe.\n\n404\n00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,740\nAdministrator, I got it wrong there.\n\n405\n00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,070\nCompatibility administrator and\nof course this is going to need some,\n\n406\n00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,720\npretty decent access to\nthe registry as well.\n\n407\n00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,460\nNow, what this is, alright,\nthis is a set of known\n\n408\n00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,770\nproblems and the fixes to those problems,\nagain, that Microsoft is already aware of.\n\n409\n00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,650\nSo you if know maybe what\nthis application needs.\n\n410\n00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,580\nI have an idea.\n\n411\n00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,940\nI think I know what it needs.\n\n412\n00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,180\nI think it needs to run\nas an administrator.\n\n413\n00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,608\nSo I could come in here and I can look for\nthe specific fix that I need.\n\n414\n00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:28,570\nI can right-click on New Database\n> Create New > Application Fix.\n\n415\n00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,335\nAnd, I'm gonna call this let's see,\nstockviewer.\n\n416\n00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,700\nIf I can spell viewer.\n\n417\n00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,800\nCan you help me spell viewer?\n\n418\n00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,151\n>> V-I-E-W- oh, nevermind.\n\n419\n00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:42,562\n>> That's okay.\n\n420\n00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:48,172\nI challenge myself every day,\nI'm a challenged person.\n\n421\n00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:53,458\nAll right, now the next thing that we need\nto do is we need to find the executable,\n\n422\n00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:59,990\nthe application in question and\nhere it's got that path.\n\n423\n00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,670\nWe can say Next and\nI can run this in a compatibility mode or\n\n424\n00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,910\nI can, so in compatibility mode for\na specific operating system.\n\n425\n00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,220\nAnd you can see, like,\nby default it's grayed out here.\n\n426\n00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,120\nIt says Windows Vista Service Pack 2.\n\n427\n00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,880\nNow, I'm thinking that if I look down in\nhere, I'm gonna find this Run as Admin.\n\n428\n00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,820\nAnd I'm thinking that might fix it.\n\n429\n00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,600\nWe're gonna find out.\n\n430\n00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,360\nWe're gonna cross our fingers and hope.\n\n431\n00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,980\nI'm gonna choose Next on this.\n\n432\n00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,980\nAnd there are other ones in\nhere that you can do too.\n\n433\n00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,490\nLike for instance, there's one\nthat says ElevateCreateProcess.\n\n434\n00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,230\nI'm gonna add that one and\nthen I'm gonna finish it up and\n\n435\n00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,260\nwith a matching information for\nthe fix that I want.\n\n436\n00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,710\nSo, now it's there and you might think\ngreat, now we've got our application fix.\n\n437\n00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,395\n>> Yes.\n\n438\n00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,785\n>> No, unfortunately we don't.\n\n439\n00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:45,300\nWe have to save it first.\n\n440\n00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,055\n[LAUGH]\nSo\n\n441\n00:22:48,055 --> 00:22:53,065\nI'm gonna say stockview, or oops,\nI'm gonna do my do caps lock.\n\n442\n00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:56,397\nLike I said, guys,\nyou can laugh at me typing here on camera.\n\n443\n00:22:56,397 --> 00:23:00,754\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes, Stockviewershim2 and we'll say OK.\n\n444\n00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:05,230\nI'm gonna go ahead and, just for\nnow, save this to the desktop.\n\n445\n00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,930\nI've got to name it again apparently.\n\n446\n00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:14,010\nNow, what's cool about this is that\nthis can be uploaded to a database and\n\n447\n00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,330\nyou'll be ready to go.\n\n448\n00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,390\nSo, I'm gonna say stockviewershim2,\nclick Save.\n\n449\n00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,860\nNow, from here, once I've saved it,\nI can install it.\n\n450\n00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,110\nYou go back to the database.\n\n451\n00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,410\nYou right-click and choose install.\n\n452\n00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,720\nAnd boy, wasn't that fascinating.\n\n453\n00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,280\n>> Woo.\n\n454\n00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,930\n>> So now we're gonna close down this\nCompatibility Administrator, and\n\n455\n00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,640\nwe're gonna go navigate\nback to that same location.\n\n456\n00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,170\nAnd we're gonna scroll over to\nour line of business application.\n\n457\n00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,020\nWe're gonna hope.\n\n458\n00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,610\nAnd here, right now,\n\n459\n00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,360\nthe application compatibility\nfix is elevating this process.\n\n460\n00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,360\nIt's giving us, hopefully, administrative\nlevel access for this program.\n\n461\n00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,368\nNow I did not give a set run as\nadministrator, but that's not all.\n\n462\n00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:06,255\nCuz we had a couple other things in here\nthat we were gonna hopefully it would do.\n\n463\n00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:08,455\nSo let's see if we've got Tools.\n\n464\n00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:11,787\nOh, I went through all that just to let me\nknow that the free version doesn't have\n\n465\n00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:12,375\nany options.\n\n466\n00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,684\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n467\n00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:18,133\naccess denied, but it's not throwing\nthe error again that it was earlier.\n\n468\n00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:19,384\nWell let's see, can I update?\n\n469\n00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:25,675\nLook at that, we can update.\n\n470\n00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:26,425\n>> Nice.\n\n471\n00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,113\n>> And the applications are up to date,\n\n472\n00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:30,133\nand now this application is working for\nus.\n\n473\n00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:35,389\nAnd if we go in, last thing here,\nif we go right, if I can right click here,\n\n474\n00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:39,370\nright click and\nchoose programs and features.\n\n475\n00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,440\nAnd yes it did work correctly, thank you.\n\n476\n00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,861\nYou will see both the [INAUDIBLE]\nthat was generated by\n\n477\n00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:51,070\nthe Standard User Architecture that was\napplied to this application, and you can\n\n478\n00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:56,128\nalso see the one that we manually created\nwith the compatibility administrator\n\n479\n00:24:56,128 --> 00:25:00,758\nfrom the compatibility database again\nremember those are known fixes.\n\n480\n00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:03,458\nFor applications again that\nMicrosoft's already aware of, and\n\n481\n00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,841\nour application's ready to go.\n\n482\n00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:06,383\n>> Hm, nice.\n\n483\n00:25:06,383 --> 00:25:10,937\n[COUGH] On that UAC prompt, it said on\nthere that application compatibility was\n\n484\n00:25:10,937 --> 00:25:15,008\nthe one requesting the elevated\npermissions, not the stock viewer.\n\n485\n00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,675\n>> Yes.\n\n486\n00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:17,512\n>> So I guess that guy then,\n\n487\n00:25:17,512 --> 00:25:22,160\nit was invoking the admin access\non behalf of the stock viewer.\n\n488\n00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,120\n>> Yup exactly it stands kind\nof like as a middle man,\n\n489\n00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,360\nsaying well you can't do this because\nyou don't even know what that is.\n\n490\n00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,800\nYou weren't written in the days\nthat that even existed.\n\n491\n00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,670\nSo I'm going to do it on your behalf so\nthat that environment is set and\n\n492\n00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,577\nready to go when\nthe application launches well.\n\n493\n00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,390\n>> Nice.\nWell, sweet.\n\n494\n00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,960\nWell, yeah, that's a-\n>> That's a little bit about\n\n495\n00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,142\nthe issue too.\n\n496\n00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:47,210\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, looking at some of those\nother options and stuff in there, I mean,\n\n497\n00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:52,170\nyou can really tailor it to whatever\napp it is you're trying to save.\n\n498\n00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:52,710\n>> Yes.\n\n499\n00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,430\nDefinitely.\n\n500\n00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,660\nAnd there are hundreds\nof settings in there.\n\n501\n00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,950\nAnd also know, when we did an application\nfix, we can do a compatibility mode.\n\n502\n00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,550\nWe can say run this in the context\nof XP with Service Pack 2.\n\n503\n00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,845\nAnd it applies the whole environment.\n\n504\n00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:05,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n505\n00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,440\n>> So not just the specific\nfix within the application but\n\n506\n00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,000\nthe entire computing environments\nsupplied to the application.\n\n507\n00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,340\n>> Man, that's heavy stuff.\n\n508\n00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,050\n>> Yes.\nYes.\n\n509\n00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,950\n>> To do.\nAlright, well, sweet.\n\n510\n00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,750\nIt looks like we're coming\nup on our break here.\n\n511\n00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,450\n>> Okay.\n\n512\n00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,910\n>> Wes, anything else to add\nbefore we go into the first break?\n\n513\n00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,970\n>> No sir,\n[LAUGH] none that I can think of.\n\n514\n00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,941\n>> [LAUGH] Well, sweet.\nAll right, so more compatibility stuff,\n\n515\n00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:29,133\nafter the break.\n\n516\n00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:37,008\n[SOUND].\n\n517\n00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:38,966\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n518\n00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:43,896\nAll right, so now what we have lined\nup is the idea of using or I guess,\n\n519\n00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,716\nso we had application compatibility.\n\n520\n00:26:46,716 --> 00:26:50,750\nSo now,\nwe're looking at application coexistence.\n\n521\n00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,410\nSo you take an application, and we have\nit run with other stuff that you've got.\n\n522\n00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,740\nAnd different ways of hammering that out.\n\n523\n00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,785\nSo at the top of the list,\nwe've got Hyper-V, Remote App, and App V.\n\n524\n00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:06,061\nSo let's take a look at Hyper-V first.\n\n525\n00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:10,635\nHyper-V is a virtualization\ntechnology that Windows 8.\n\n526\n00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:13,535\nSo it's a client Hyper-V as they call it.\n\n527\n00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:17,262\nAnd it allows running another\n\n528\n00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:21,982\ncomputer in it's own little\nconfined space on a host PC.\n\n529\n00:27:21,982 --> 00:27:23,642\nWe're on your existing hardware.\n\n530\n00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:29,256\nReally neat fantastic stuff and\nwe can use that to yeah.\n\n531\n00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:34,016\nTo run applications that\ncan power on your PC and\n\n532\n00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,386\nnot have it interfere with all\nthe other stuff that you got running.\n\n533\n00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,926\n>> It's one of the things, virtualization,\n\n534\n00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:42,140\nthat we use showing you guys\nthese demonstrations here.\n\n535\n00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,440\nAnd that's one of the good\nthings about Windows 8.\n\n536\n00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,770\nUp until now that's really been\na server side implementation.\n\n537\n00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,220\nServer side products.\n\n538\n00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,800\nAnd with Windows 8, and Windows 8.1\ncoming out, now they've found a way that\n\n539\n00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,570\nif you're in an enterprise level market,\nor maybe you do want to test bed software.\n\n540\n00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,270\nMaybe you do want to test bed the next\nprogram that you're going to deploy out to\n\n541\n00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,230\nyour company.\n\n542\n00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,410\nYou don't want to just rush out and\ndeploy it to the company and\n\n543\n00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,310\nbring down your entire production network.\n\n544\n00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:13,110\nSo this gives you the ability to test bed\nthem but it also gives you the ability,\n\n545\n00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,203\ntoo, that you can run applications in an\nenvironment that's native to the virtual\n\n546\n00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:23,250\nmachine or maybe native to its environment\nto begin with was originally coded on.\n\n547\n00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,520\n>> Yeah as you mention virtual\nmachines we use virtual\n\n548\n00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,720\nmachines pretty heavily here testing our\napplications and then doing things at\n\n549\n00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,290\nATV and UEV labs that's all\nrunning off virtual machines.\n\n550\n00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,750\n>> Yes.\n>> And it's really\n\n551\n00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,390\nconvenient because we can build\na machine up, have a clean environment,\n\n552\n00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,017\nwe can run our demos,or, to turn it\nback to the application co-existence.\n\n553\n00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,690\nWe can run these specific apps\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n554\n00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,500\n>> and at the end of\n\n555\n00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,180\nthe day we can just wipe the thing out and\nstart fresh and clean all over again.\n\n556\n00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,430\n>> Yeah, not have to go through\nthe process without virtualization.\n\n557\n00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,980\nIf we mess up a machine,\nin a testing process.\n\n558\n00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,750\nWell, what would we have to do?\n\n559\n00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,510\nWell, we'd have to format the hard drive,\nreinstall Windows, update everything,\n\n560\n00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:14,280\nreinstall the application, and\nthen update the application.\n\n561\n00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,080\nAnd now, we're ready for the second test.\n\n562\n00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,610\nIt's so\nmuch easier now that you can test it.\n\n563\n00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,660\nAnd it's kinda like that\nGet Out of Jail Free card.\n\n564\n00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,700\nJust roll back all the settings.\n\n565\n00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,540\nAnd start fresh.\n\n566\n00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,580\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n567\n00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,290\nNow of course there are some\nlimitations on using Hyper-V.\n\n568\n00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,930\nYou have to have\nthe hardware to support it,\n\n569\n00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,791\nyour host computer has to\nhave four gigs of ram.\n\n570\n00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:42,485\nRAM, a 64-bit processor has to have second\nlevel address translation built into\n\n571\n00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:47,285\nthe guy, and you have to have the hardware\nspace, the hardware, the hard drive space.\n\n572\n00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:47,895\n>> Hard drive space.\n\n573\n00:29:47,895 --> 00:29:49,390\n>> To hold another OS on there.\n\n574\n00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,600\n>> Sure.\n\n575\n00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,970\n>> The RAM,\nthe memory to support the stuff.\n\n576\n00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,230\nSo, if a computer can support Hyper-V,\nit's another route to go take that stuff.\n\n577\n00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,000\nNow let's say you have a computer and\n\n578\n00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,710\nlet's say its running Windows XP or\nsome crap like that.\n\n579\n00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,610\nAnd you've got your line-of-business app\nand it runs perfectly on Windows XP.\n\n580\n00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,190\nYou can use a tool,\nI'm not sure if you'd call it a tool,\n\n581\n00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,940\nlike a suite I guess, System Center.\n\n582\n00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:27,370\nYou can use the Virtual Machine Manager\nto capture this physical computer and\n\n583\n00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:31,450\nturn it into a virtual machine,\nwhere you can then fire up.\n\n584\n00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:37,530\nNow, on a smaller scale, there's\na sysinternals program called Disk2-\n\n585\n00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,590\n>> Disk, what was it, Disk2physical,\n\n586\n00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,210\nor Disk2vhd?\n\n587\n00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,180\n>> Disk2vhd.\n\n588\n00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,720\n>> That's it, yeah,\nI' ve seen that one before.\n\n589\n00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,450\n>> And yeah, so you can take this program.\n\n590\n00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,460\nAnd you can take it over to\nyour Windows XP machine, and\n\n591\n00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,670\ncreate a VHD out of that\nWindows XP computer.\n\n592\n00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,540\nFire it up on your host PC\nthat's running Hyper-V.\n\n593\n00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,120\nAnd there you go.\n\n594\n00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,820\nThere's your Windows XP machine.\n\n595\n00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,010\nAnd you can run that app right there\nin it's own little environment.\n\n596\n00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,310\nYou can use everything.\n\n597\n00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,510\nGet your data out of it, or what not.\n\n598\n00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,180\nThen just shut the guy down,\nyour back into Windows 8.\n\n599\n00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,740\nAnd yeah, go about your day.\n\n600\n00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,700\n>> Yeah, and when we talk about\nsomething like coexistence,\n\n601\n00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,430\nmaybe you've got that\napplication that was.\n\n602\n00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,700\nJust like Nate said, it was written for\nXP, he can't afford to lose it,\n\n603\n00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,210\nhe captured that machine,\nit's running on Hyper-V, but guess what?\n\n604\n00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,670\nWe've also got machines that run\nthe new version of the application.\n\n605\n00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,940\nAnd these guys don't like\nto play nice together.\n\n606\n00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,090\nWe have versioning conflicts that happens,\nthat usually say,\n\n607\n00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,650\n\"You have to uninstall one application\nbefore you can install the new one.\"\n\n608\n00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,900\nWell what if that not good for\nyour business?\n\n609\n00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,150\nWhat if you need both line\nof business applications?\n\n610\n00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,820\nWhat if you need that one\nin the original version and\n\n611\n00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,070\nyou need the one in the new one?\n\n612\n00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,200\nWell again, how are they gonna\nbe able to run side-by-side?\n\n613\n00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,680\nWell, I can have Hyper-V installed,\njust like Nate says.\n\n614\n00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,900\nCapture that machine.\n\n615\n00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,240\nPut it in the Hyper-V.\n\n616\n00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,810\nAnd then I can also install maybe\nthe application that is compatible with\n\n617\n00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:00,790\nWindows 8 or 8.1 and\nrun them side by side because of\n\n618\n00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,290\nthe fact that the virtualized\ninfrastructure isolates the application.\n\n619\n00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,570\nThey can run side by side, and\nthere is no version conflict.\n\n620\n00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,000\n>> Yeah.\nIt's fantastic.\n\n621\n00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,380\nNow in the 76 87 we show that to I guess\nup Hyper-V create a virtual machine.\n\n622\n00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,130\nSo, I guess as far as application\ncode exists, nothing unique\n\n623\n00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,635\nenough to where we're gonna build up\ndo the same thing all over again here.\n\n624\n00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:32,470\n>> Sure.\n>> You jump over to the 687 show and\n\n625\n00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:40,800\ncheck that out on how to bring up\nHyper V on a Windows 8 machine.\n\n626\n00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,070\n>> And it does some, you do run\nthe risk of physical limitation.\n\n627\n00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,670\nIt's right.\nI mean\n\n628\n00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,980\nif your hardware doesn't support it,\nApp-V is not gonna be the choice for you.\n\n629\n00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,740\nExcuse me.\n\n630\n00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,350\nBut one of the good things, if you do\nhave that existing infrastructure,\n\n631\n00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:56,270\nthe hardware to support it is the fact\nthat once you install this application.\n\n632\n00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,530\nLet's say it's not\na network-connected application, and\n\n633\n00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,240\npeople can use it without\na network connection.\n\n634\n00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,880\nWe're gonna talk about some of\nthese other scenarios that require\n\n635\n00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,500\na network-based connection.\n\n636\n00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,370\nWell, that is another\ngood thing about App-V,\n\n637\n00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,323\nis that once I install that program.\n\n638\n00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,241\n[CROSSTALK] Or, excuse me, not App-V.\n\n639\n00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:11,775\nHyper-V.\n\n640\n00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:12,438\nThank you.\n\n641\n00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:13,260\nI'm glad you're here, Nate.\n\n642\n00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hyper-V.\n\n643\n00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,920\nOnce I install that application\nwithin the Hyper-V of the machine,\n\n644\n00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,290\nI don't need to worry about connecting the\nnetwork resources to make it available.\n\n645\n00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,190\nNow, it's available on the local machine.\n\n646\n00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,350\nPeople don't even need a network\nconnection anymore and\n\n647\n00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,335\nthey can still run that app.\n\n648\n00:33:26,335 --> 00:33:27,520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n649\n00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,670\nYeah, you run a lot of\nvirtual machines all at once,\n\n650\n00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,490\nif you have the hardware to support it.\n\n651\n00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,749\nAnd have Windows whatever\nyou need running.\n\n652\n00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:36,775\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then this, and\n\n653\n00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:39,995\nthen this one, and the other one and\nbe able to flip flop back and forth.\n\n654\n00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:44,467\n>> Yeah, and at the end of the day\nif your test bed doesn't work right,\n\n655\n00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:46,835\nwe start over and and start fresh.\n\n656\n00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:50,595\nRevert them all back, and\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n657\n00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,095\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n658\n00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,292\n>> Now, we do have up next,\n\n659\n00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:55,585\nyeah anything else on [INAUDIBLE]\n>> No that's pretty much like you said,\n\n660\n00:33:55,585 --> 00:34:01,170\nwe check out our 76-87 class of course and\nthat'll show you.\n\n661\n00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:06,300\nMore of the infrastructure and setting\nup Hyper-V, so that you can lead into\n\n662\n00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,400\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n663\n00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,910\n>> Sweet.\n>> Yeah.\n\n664\n00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,460\n>> And even the server one in 410,\n>> Mike and Don,\n\n665\n00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,260\nthey hammer out some Hyper-V stuff.\n\n666\n00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,820\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n667\n00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,520\nAnd the platforms are the same.\n\n668\n00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,825\nJust one runs on a client,\none runs on the server.\n\n669\n00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But, when it comes down to it,\n\n670\n00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,910\nthe configurations are pretty close.\n\n671\n00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,620\nNow, I'm sure the server has a lot of\n\n672\n00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,320\nbusiness class features\nthat may be client does.\n\n673\n00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,335\nBut, we'll talk about\nthat at another time.\n\n674\n00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:30,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n675\n00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,860\nAll right.\n\n676\n00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,610\nSo, next thing that we have\nlined up is Remote App.\n\n677\n00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right?\n\n678\n00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,530\nSo Remote App, is a way where you can,\n\n679\n00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,820\nI guess, virtualize just that one\napplication that you need and\n\n680\n00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,320\nbe able to access it over the network.\n\n681\n00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,210\nIt sits on remote desktop services, and\n\n682\n00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,690\nyou just kind of, I guess,\nlike remote into just this one.\n\n683\n00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:01,520\nOne app, and it runs on your desktop,\nits own little Window, and\n\n684\n00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,625\nit's pretty amazing.\n\n685\n00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,980\n>> Well,\nwhat I'm thinking of here right now?\n\n686\n00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,160\nWe're talking about Hyper-V, right?\n\n687\n00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,867\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We're talking about running a machine\n\n688\n00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:08,930\nwithin a machine, right?\n\n689\n00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,980\nCan you imagine having to\nsupport that with an end user?\n\n690\n00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,580\nTelling them no,\ndon't click that Start button.\n\n691\n00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,910\nDon't click that Start button.\n\n692\n00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,900\nNo, click the Start button in the virtual,\nno not on your desktop,\n\n693\n00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,820\nin the virtual machine.\n\n694\n00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:24,110\nWell, one of the great things is it says\nthe application runs in it's own Window.\n\n695\n00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,540\nIt launches, there is the application.\n\n696\n00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,640\nNo start screen.\n\n697\n00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,010\nNo virtual machine.\n\n698\n00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,705\nAnd it might lead to a little bit [LAUGH]\nbetter coexistence with the employees.\n\n699\n00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:35,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n700\n00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:39,680\nYeah, and with Remote App, all right,\nit would work out really well, if you have\n\n701\n00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,680\na specific line of business application,\nand you can run it on your server there.\n\n702\n00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,655\nEverything runs great.\n\n703\n00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:49,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well, you can have all your clients all\n\n704\n00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:53,860\nover that can then, I guess,\naccess the stats through Remote App.\n\n705\n00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,575\nWithout having to go and\ndeploy it to all your different machines.\n\n706\n00:35:57,575 --> 00:35:59,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Handling updates and\n\n707\n00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,955\nthat sort of thing.\n\n708\n00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:01,750\n>> Yes.\n>> I mean\n\n709\n00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,530\nyou can really just do\nit on that one machine.\n\n710\n00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,030\nEverybody can just dial into it,\nand use it as they need.\n\n711\n00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,640\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n712\n00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,840\nAnd that's, when it comes to application\ndeployment, and application management.\n\n713\n00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,830\nRemote App allows you that\ncentralized administration.\n\n714\n00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:19,150\nAgain you deploy the app in one location,\nrather than 50,\n\n715\n00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,580\n500, 1,000 locations and\nthen have to go to those machines, and\n\n716\n00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,980\nmanage the support for\nevery one of those applications.\n\n717\n00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,890\nI don't have to do that.\n\n718\n00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,560\nI install it in a single location.\n\n719\n00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,380\nLet everybody connect back to it through\nthe Remote App software on Windows 8.1.\n\n720\n00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,500\nAnd they are all connected\nto that single point.\n\n721\n00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,230\nAnd from there I can manage it, and\nagain like I said deploy updates.\n\n722\n00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,000\nI don't have to wait.\n\n723\n00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000\nOkay, well did Sally have the update yet?\n\n724\n00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,270\nNo, I don't think her computer\nwas connected to the network at\n\n725\n00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,060\nthe time of the update.\n\n726\n00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,440\nYou don't have to worry about all that.\n\n727\n00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,520\nIt's a centralized location,\nadministration,\n\n728\n00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,015\nmanagement, and\njust overall maintenance too.\n\n729\n00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:55,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n730\n00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,340\nYeah, and\nif you do have a specific version of\n\n731\n00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,250\nthis app [COUGH] running locally, or\nsomething else that it conflicts with,\n\n732\n00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,520\nremote app run in it's\nown little session and\n\n733\n00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,120\nso it doesn't affect any of the existing\napps that are on your desktop.\n\n734\n00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,890\n>> Yeah.\nVery good.\n\n735\n00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,334\n>> Now, why don't we take a look at that?\n\n736\n00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,389\n>> Okay, cool with me.\n\n737\n00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:18,400\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n738\n00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,055\n>> For\nthis though I virtualize all of our stuff.\n\n739\n00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:22,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n740\n00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,600\n>> And Remote App relies on\nvirtualization to push this stuff out.\n\n741\n00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,920\nAnd, you can't virtualize in\na virtualized machine and so, for\n\n742\n00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,540\nthis demo we're going to use the Technet\nvirtual lab to see how this guy works.\n\n743\n00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,150\nThere it goes.\n\n744\n00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:38,730\nAll right.\n\n745\n00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,060\nSo, on the Technet virtual labs we've got,\nor actually\n\n746\n00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,375\nyou'd have to do technetmicrosoft.com\nslash the address up there.\n\n747\n00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:50,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n748\n00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,670\n>> And you have virtual labs.\n\n749\n00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:58,220\nThey're pretty slick, pretty neat stuff,\nand the one that we are using,\n\n750\n00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,820\nthe one for Remote App and\nremote desktop session.\n\n751\n00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,720\nAnd so I have launched this guy up.\n\n752\n00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,282\nAnd and so here we are.\n\n753\n00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:11,300\nNow, the and in starting the roll\nthe remote desktop services roll.\n\n754\n00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,250\nI I did that before the show here and\n\n755\n00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,880\nit takes a little bit of time, and I don't\njust have you stand around and [LAUGH].\n\n756\n00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,590\n>> That's okay, like I made you\ndo when I was installing .net.\n\n757\n00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,785\nSo, I've done all\nthe configuration beforehand.\n\n758\n00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:27,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And of course on 688 they're not\n\n759\n00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:32,170\nworried so much about,\nknowing exactly how to build everything.\n\n760\n00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,730\nJust kind of what it is.\n\n761\n00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,176\n>> Like the concepts [CROSSTALK] and\nhow they interact and work?\n\n762\n00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:37,000\n>> Okay, cool.\n\n763\n00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,849\n>> So to get started off,\nso remote desktop services.\n\n764\n00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,720\nOver here we've got the,\nI guess the dashboard here.\n\n765\n00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,310\nFor just the basic general tasks up front.\n\n766\n00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:55,140\nNow, on this stuff we won't, I guess, we\ndon't need you to do anything up on here.\n\n767\n00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,694\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But for the management set of things,\n\n768\n00:38:57,694 --> 00:39:00,120\nI mean, click on things and add.\n\n769\n00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,690\n>> Add servers, and do stuff from here.\n\n770\n00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:09,220\nNow the part that we will be concerned\nabout, for the client side machine.\n\n771\n00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,690\n>> Very nice, yeah, very nice.\n\n772\n00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,875\n>> Now, to access this stuff.\n\n773\n00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,702\nYeah, I had to think of something.\n\n774\n00:39:15,702 --> 00:39:18,860\nAll right, so\nover on here to manage the apps, and\n\n775\n00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,280\nwhat apps are gonna be pushed out?\n\n776\n00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,068\n[SOUND] All right, maybe not.\n\n777\n00:39:26,068 --> 00:39:27,821\nSorry that was for a different thing.\n\n778\n00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:30,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n779\n00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:35,055\nso to get this stuff here\nwe will go to desktop.\n\n780\n00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:38,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We're gonna fire up a web address and\n\n781\n00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,180\nbrowse over to it.\n\n782\n00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,815\nNow Remote App, it requires on a bit\nof infrastructure setup before hand.\n\n783\n00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:44,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n784\n00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:49,340\n>> Now we go to https://server one.\n\n785\n00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,494\nI'll go ahead and cheat and\nchoose what I've already gone before.\n\n786\n00:39:54,494 --> 00:40:00,764\n[CROSSTALK]\nhttps://serverone.contoso.com/rdweb.\n\n787\n00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:05,250\nIt will browse here, and\nit's reaching out to that server, and\n\n788\n00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,910\nlooking at what applications\nare out there and what we can use?\n\n789\n00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,630\n>> Okay.\n>> All right?\n\n790\n00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,610\nWe will have to authenticate ourselves.\n\n791\n00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,090\nContoso administrator,\n\n792\n00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,150\nwe put in our password.\nPrivate computer.\n\n793\n00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,480\nWe'll go and sign in.\n\n794\n00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,690\nAnd then here we go.\n\n795\n00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,015\nThe RemoteApps that we have here,\n\n796\n00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:27,261\nwe've got Calculator, Paint, and WordPad.\n>> O good, all of my favorites.\n\n797\n00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:29,085\n>> So, what's your preference?\n\n798\n00:40:29,085 --> 00:40:30,269\n>> Minesweeper.\n\n799\n00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:32,288\nOh, sorry, let's do Paint.\n\n800\n00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:33,583\n[LAUGH]\n\n801\n00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,280\n>> All right, we'll click on Paint, and\n\n802\n00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,778\nit's gonna reach out, and\nit's gonna build this Remote Desktop\n\n803\n00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:44,150\nsession to this one app\nthat's being served up.\n\n804\n00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,484\nAll right, we'll click OK to this,\nvalidate it with our credentials,\n\n805\n00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:49,101\nand there we go.\n\n806\n00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:50,220\n>> Lookit there.\n\n807\n00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:57,140\n>> Now we can go ahead and minimize the,\nwhat are those, Explorer there.\n\n808\n00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,560\nInternet Explorer, pardon me.\n\n809\n00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,930\nBut yeah, so\nit's running its own little window and\n\n810\n00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,130\nit's gonna function just like Paint does.\n\n811\n00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,380\n>> Hey, looks just like my notes.\n\n812\n00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,902\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it looks like your notes\nfrom [CROSSTALK] >> There we go, perfect.\n\n813\n00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:13,580\n[LAUGH]\n>> And yeah, so there we go.\n\n814\n00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,770\nWe can save all of our stuff,\nand do whatnot.\n\n815\n00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:20,300\nNow there's another thing that\nwe can do with RemoteApp.\n\n816\n00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,790\nSo we won't save that.\n\n817\n00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,430\nAnd lets go ahead and\nswitch users to Ben Smith.\n\n818\n00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,489\nType this guy's password.\n\n819\n00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,700\nAll right.\n\n820\n00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,706\nSo, a pretty neat thing\nthat we can do here\n\n821\n00:41:36,706 --> 00:41:41,060\nis pin these RemoteApps\nto our start screen.\n\n822\n00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,340\nSo we're logged in here as Ben Smith.\n\n823\n00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,630\nWe can use Microsoft's Remote Desktop\nmodern UI style app.\n\n824\n00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,513\n>> Oh, lookie there.\n\n825\n00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:51,951\n>> So\nwe go Remote Desktop > Work Resources, and\n\n826\n00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:54,280\nthe apps that we have available.\n\n827\n00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,210\nSame list available for\nBen Smith as we had for the other guy.\n\n828\n00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,100\nAnd so which one do you want to pick?\n\n829\n00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,529\n>> Oh, we'll do WordPad,\nyeah, we'll do WordPad now.\n\n830\n00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:06,384\n>> All right, we'll fire up WordPad and\nonce again it's going to reach out and\n\n831\n00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:07,600\nmake that connection.\n\n832\n00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,708\n>> And while he's authenticating,\n\n833\n00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:14,058\nkeep in mind that everything is going\npretty much over that Remote Desktop\n\n834\n00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:17,806\nconnection software that's already been\nnative to Windows for a very long time.\n\n835\n00:42:20,743 --> 00:42:22,622\n>> Wait for this guy to start up.\n\n836\n00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:25,716\nThere we go.\n\n837\n00:42:25,716 --> 00:42:31,203\n[SOUND] All right, so there we go.\n\n838\n00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:36,100\nWordPad, and it'll work just the same\nas if it was indeed running locally.\n\n839\n00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,780\nNow what we can do is, so\nwe just won't save that.\n\n840\n00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,420\nSo we'll go over here and\nwe'll type in WordPad.\n\n841\n00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,280\nNow we have a WordPad\nwith nothing after it and\n\n842\n00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,110\nthat is what's installed\nlocally on this machine.\n\n843\n00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,850\n>> Okay\n>> Then we have WordPad Work Resources\n\n844\n00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,740\nright below that.\n\n845\n00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,750\nThat is the RemoteApp application, and we\ncan just click it and run it off of there.\n\n846\n00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,316\nWhen we right-click on that guy,\nwe can put it into start.\n\n847\n00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:04,328\nAll right?\n\n848\n00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:09,620\nSo now we're gonna have, [SOUND]\nthere we go, WordPad Work Resources.\n\n849\n00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,219\nSo, we can have all our RemoteApps that\nwe access frequently pinned to here,\n\n850\n00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,725\nwe can just browse to it.\n\n851\n00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:18,721\nWe can click it, and maybe we'll just say,\ndon't ask me again for that.\n\n852\n00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,592\n>> Mm-hm, sure.\n\n853\n00:43:19,592 --> 00:43:25,009\n>> And [SOUND] of course kind\nof the same steps as before.\n\n854\n00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:28,460\nBut it's gonna go out and\nmake that connection after we click OK.\n\n855\n00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,330\nAnd there we go.\n\n856\n00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,200\nAnd then we have a WordPad.\n\n857\n00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,810\n>> So what you see here is really cool,\n\n858\n00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,900\nis that they look like\nthey've installed locally.\n\n859\n00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,824\nSo they, I mean other than work resources,\n\n860\n00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,490\nWordPad looked like WordPad regardless,\nright?\n\n861\n00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:45,339\nAnd they look like they install locally,\nbut they're really running on the server,\n\n862\n00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:47,483\nthey're really running\non another location.\n\n863\n00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:50,857\nSo one of the things that\nthis is really good for is,\n\n864\n00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:55,800\nmaybe your local client doesn't have\nthe hardware resources that it needs\n\n865\n00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,360\nto run this application, but\nyou still need to use the application.\n\n866\n00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,750\nWell this gives you the advantage to\nrun it through that RemoteApp and\n\n867\n00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,860\ndesktop connections platform.\n\n868\n00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,940\nAnd the local machine itself doesn't\nhave to provide the resources,\n\n869\n00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,210\nthe memory, the CPU utilization for\nthis application.\n\n870\n00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:21,001\nCuz again, it's running remotely and it's\njust being displayed here on our desktop.\n\n871\n00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:25,730\n>> Yeah, and as far as what I got,\nthere we go.\n\n872\n00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,020\n>> That's a really,\nreally cool infrastructure.\n\n873\n00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,050\n>> There's your RemoteApp.\n\n874\n00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,830\n>> Very cool.\n\n875\n00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,020\n>> Now, Wes,\nwe do have a little bit of time left.\n\n876\n00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,260\nNot enough to do App-V, but\nlet's just talk about App-V.\n\n877\n00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,638\n>> Okay.\n>> While we've got a little bit left.\n\n878\n00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:41,487\n>> Okay.\n\n879\n00:44:41,487 --> 00:44:46,510\n>> So, App-V, kinda the same, not really.\n\n880\n00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,400\nIt still allows us to use more than one\napplication that would normally conflict\n\n881\n00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,505\nwith each other on the same machine.\n\n882\n00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:54,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n883\n00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,391\n>> One thing with App-V that RemoteApp\ndoes not do is that App-V will\n\n884\n00:44:58,391 --> 00:45:01,430\nallow us to cache that\napp to our computer.\n\n885\n00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:05,110\nIt doesn't install it,\nit can cache the whole thing.\n\n886\n00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,862\nSo we can use it while\nwe're off the network.\n\n887\n00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:12,730\nUnlike RemoteApp, you have to be on the\nnetwork or have a network connection and\n\n888\n00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:17,050\ndirect access to your\nworkplace to fire that guy up.\n\n889\n00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:22,540\n>> Now does it download the entire\napplication, or does it just install or\n\n890\n00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,290\ndownload exactly what's needed\nby the client at the time?\n\n891\n00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,130\n>> It can do both.\n\n892\n00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,750\n>> I believe so, I thought it could.\n\n893\n00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,540\n>> Yep.\nSo yeah, now of course you can set\n\n894\n00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:37,510\nthe cache sizes and that sort of thing on\nhow much of this guy you want to keep.\n\n895\n00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,140\nOr if you have a bunch of small\napplications you can cache all of them and\n\n896\n00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,700\nuse them.\n\n897\n00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:50,620\nSo let's say for example, Adobe Suite,\na lot of apps in there, it's pretty big.\n\n898\n00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,320\nYou could push all that stuff out and\nyour users would be able to access it\n\n899\n00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,250\nwithout having to download,\nI mean that, how big is the thing?\n\n900\n00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,540\n>> Oh yeah, it's-\n>> Gigs and gigs?\n\n901\n00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,385\n>> Yeah.\n\n902\n00:45:59,385 --> 00:46:03,758\n>> And so, you can pull down just what you\nneed, enough to work on that application.\n\n903\n00:46:03,758 --> 00:46:08,684\nJust do what you want and so,\nyour users can use that suite of apps\n\n904\n00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:12,770\nwithout having to\ndownload the whole thing.\n\n905\n00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:17,720\nSo you don't have to have these big\nmass roll-outs and all that stuff.\n\n906\n00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,500\n>> So where bandwidth is a concern,\nthis might be the solution for you.\n\n907\n00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,030\nIf you've got a limited bandwidth,\n\n908\n00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,850\nyou don't have a lot of\nnetwork resources to utilize.\n\n909\n00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,110\nYou can pull these down and\n\n910\n00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:32,660\nyou can start using the app without\nthe entire app actually installing.\n\n911\n00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,568\nSo we can start using it right away,\n\n912\n00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:39,760\nthe moment it starts synchronizing or\ndownloading the portions of the app.\n\n913\n00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,830\n>> Yeah.\nAnd since these apps,\n\n914\n00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,900\nthey're running from that cache,\nthey're not messing with any of your\n\n915\n00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,170\nexisting stuff that you\nhave installed in there.\n\n916\n00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:52,764\nAnd so if you do have an app that it's\ngonna conflict with, or an older or\n\n917\n00:46:52,764 --> 00:46:53,925\na newer version.\n\n918\n00:46:53,925 --> 00:46:58,464\nSometimes if you download,\nlet's say, VLC Player.\n\n919\n00:46:58,464 --> 00:47:00,520\nI use VLC Player quite a bit.\n\n920\n00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,030\nAmazing program, plays almost\neverything that I have on my computer.\n\n921\n00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,670\nWell, when you install a newer\nversion of VLC Player,\n\n922\n00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,180\nit overwrites the existing one.\n\n923\n00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:15,230\nWell, lets say you have a version of\nan app, and you need to use an older one.\n\n924\n00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,820\nWell, you don't want the two to\noverwrite one another, or whatnot.\n\n925\n00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,830\nAnd so\nit doesn't install anything locally.\n\n926\n00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:25,110\nAlthough you can use it off the network,\n\n927\n00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:29,750\nit doesn't install and so\nyou can just keep your existing stuff.\n\n928\n00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,176\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n929\n00:47:31,176 --> 00:47:35,460\n>> And now App-V does require\na bit of stuff to roll it out.\n\n930\n00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:42,380\nAnd we'll run through the steps after\nthe break and see how it's done.\n\n931\n00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,200\n>> And how everything fits together,\nall right.\n\n932\n00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,270\n>> So, Wes,\nanything to add before the break?\n\n933\n00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,000\n>> Nothing else.\n\n934\n00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,790\nNothing else.\n\n935\n00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:53,445\n>> All right so we'll do some\nApp -V stuff after the break.\n\n936\n00:47:53,445 --> 00:48:01,386\n[SOUND].\n\n937\n00:48:01,386 --> 00:48:03,930\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n938\n00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:05,920\nAnd Wes, Intune.\n\n939\n00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,800\n>> Intune.\n\n940\n00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,960\nGotta love Intune right?\n\n941\n00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,922\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so you said,\n\n942\n00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:10,550\ndon't mention Intune.\n\n943\n00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,160\n>> Don't mention Intune.\n\n944\n00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,340\nSo, I don't know.\n\n945\n00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,250\nThat was bad.\n\n946\n00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,870\n>> Well, you get paybacks.\n\n947\n00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,380\n>> Oh, man.\n\n948\n00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:16,960\n>> That's it.\n\n949\n00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,034\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so,\n\n950\n00:48:19,034 --> 00:48:21,320\nwe've got App-V lined up.\n\n951\n00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:27,288\nNow, App-V is part of\nthe Microsoft Desktop Optimization-\n\n952\n00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:28,820\n>> Yeah, MDOP.\n\n953\n00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,320\n>> MDOP.\nYep.\n\n954\n00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:29,880\n>> Yep.\n\n955\n00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,871\n>> MDOP,\nMicrosoft Desktop Optimization Pack.\n\n956\n00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:37,268\nNow, it's only available to\nsoftware assurance subscribers?\n\n957\n00:48:37,268 --> 00:48:37,865\nIs that right?\n\n958\n00:48:37,865 --> 00:48:39,122\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n959\n00:48:39,122 --> 00:48:42,800\n>> And so, yeah, we got a copy of it.\n\n960\n00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,230\n>> I was gonna say, essentially,\nit it requires licensing.\n\n961\n00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,310\nYou gotta have a volume\nlicensing contract, I believe,\n\n962\n00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,545\nwith Microsoft to get that.\n\n963\n00:48:49,545 --> 00:48:50,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n964\n00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,260\nNice.\n\n965\n00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,120\nAll right.\nSo, as a part of that,\n\n966\n00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,540\nyou will need SQL installed\nto run this guy, and\n\n967\n00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:03,990\nyou will need the web server\nrole installed on your\n\n968\n00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:07,900\ndomain controller there,\nor just a Windows server.\n\n969\n00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,440\nIt requires the web server and\n\n970\n00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,560\na lot of little subcomponents underneath\nit to get this guy up and running.\n\n971\n00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,280\nNow, for the other components,\nthere's a sequencer.\n\n972\n00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:27,660\nThe App-V sequencer takes an app and\nyou install it.\n\n973\n00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:33,080\nAnd it listens to all the changes it\nmakes to the operating system as it goes.\n\n974\n00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,930\nAnd it gathers up all those changes,\n\n975\n00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:40,050\nwraps up in a nice little package,\nand allows you to export that guy.\n\n976\n00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,840\nThere's also an App-V server that\nwill host all these applications and\n\n977\n00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,050\nprovide a spot where you\ncan manage this guy.\n\n978\n00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:49,440\nAnd, yeah.\n\n979\n00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:52,545\nSo, yeah, we'll start from there.\n\n980\n00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:57,840\nSo, on my machine here.\n\n981\n00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,550\nSo we'll start over here on this guy.\n\n982\n00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,812\nSo let's just sequence an app.\n\n983\n00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:05,120\nAll right.\n\n984\n00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,860\nSo, do we sequence an application.\n\n985\n00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,673\nClick over here.\n\n986\n00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,667\n[SOUND] There we go.\n\n987\n00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:19,170\nAll right, Microsoft Application\nVirtualization Sequencer.\n\n988\n00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,460\nWe're going to fire this guy up.\n\n989\n00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:29,040\nSo, what this is going to do, is it will\nallow the installation of a program, and\n\n990\n00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,560\nit will listen for all its changes that it\nmakes, and wrap it all up into a package.\n\n991\n00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,930\nNow, because it tracks the changes\nmade to the operating system,\n\n992\n00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,300\nMicrosoft recommends that the sequencer\nis deployed on a virtual machine.\n\n993\n00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,390\nSo that way, when you're done with it, you\ncan just revert that virtual machine to\n\n994\n00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:52,500\nan earlier checkpoint, and start fresh\nagain and then sequence your apps.\n\n995\n00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,997\nSo because of that,\n\n996\n00:50:53,997 --> 00:51:00,087\nthey recommend that the sequencer is on\na server that is just used for sequencing.\n\n997\n00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:03,666\nAnd, of course, since this is just\na virtual machine, I mean, heck,\n\n998\n00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:06,188\nyou can just turn the puppy off and\nlet it sit away.\n\n999\n00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,327\n>> Yep.\n\n1000\n00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:12,389\n>> All right, so, from here we can create\na new package or modify an existing\n\n1001\n00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:16,760\none if we had push adding updates or\nappend anything else to it.\n\n1002\n00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,472\nWe can.\n\n1003\n00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:18,748\nWe won't for this demonstration.\n\n1004\n00:51:18,748 --> 00:51:21,628\nAll right, so, here we go.\n\n1005\n00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:23,844\nSo we can create a new package, and\n\n1006\n00:51:23,844 --> 00:51:27,521\nwe'll create a package using\nthe package accelerator.\n\n1007\n00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:28,163\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1008\n00:51:28,163 --> 00:51:33,796\n>> Now, a package accelerator is like just\nsomeone else has already sequenced an app,\n\n1009\n00:51:33,796 --> 00:51:38,715\ntook those changes, and wrapped\neverything up into a little package that\n\n1010\n00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:42,710\nyou can then tack onto your own\napplication and push it out.\n\n1011\n00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:43,430\n>> Okay.\n\n1012\n00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:48,170\n>> So there are package\naccelerators out there to download.\n\n1013\n00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,025\nYou can head over to Microsoft.\n\n1014\n00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:55,300\nAnd I went over to Microsoft to see\nwhat accelerators they had over there.\n\n1015\n00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,460\nAnd so they've got this website.\n\n1016\n00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,330\nGet your accelerators here.\n\n1017\n00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,893\nAnd there's like seven.\n\n1018\n00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:02,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was like wow, all right.\n\n1019\n00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,600\n>> Nothing like choices.\n\n1020\n00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,610\nYeah, nothing like choices.\n\n1021\n00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:08,730\nAll right, so,\nwe'll just create a package.\n\n1022\n00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:10,160\nMoving right along.\n\n1023\n00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,810\nNow, it's going to check the computer to\nmake sure that it is set up, and primed,\n\n1024\n00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,040\nand ready to go.\n\n1025\n00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,140\nSo it threw up a little flag here.\n\n1026\n00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,140\nIt says, other applications are running.\n\n1027\n00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,300\nAnd it looks like\nServer Manager is running, so\n\n1028\n00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,630\nI'll just close Server Manager.\n\n1029\n00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,380\nAnd let's refresh this turkey.\n\n1030\n00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,760\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1031\n00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,930\nYour system is ready to create a package.\n\n1032\n00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,520\nSo click on Next now.\n\n1033\n00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,538\nWe're gonna just do a application, an\nadd-on, or plugins, if we had plugins for,\n\n1034\n00:52:39,538 --> 00:52:44,051\nI don't know, Office stuff,\nWord plugin, or something like that.\n\n1035\n00:52:44,051 --> 00:52:44,807\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1036\n00:52:44,807 --> 00:52:49,471\n>> We can use that one in the middle\nwhere, just like an add-on for\n\n1037\n00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:53,607\nother, well, add-on,\nnot the same word, but yeah.\n\n1038\n00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:57,554\nWe're just gonna use a standard\napplication for this one, and\n\n1039\n00:52:57,554 --> 00:52:59,353\nthen we will browse for one.\n\n1040\n00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:11,100\nAll right, so\nwe'll use this guy right here.\n\n1041\n00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,630\nThis is 7-Zip.\n\n1042\n00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,010\n>> I recognize that file.\n\n1043\n00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:18,090\n>> All right, so\nnow let's give this package a name.\n\n1044\n00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,244\nSo we'll just simply call this 7-Zip.\n\n1045\n00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:24,121\nAll right, and now we have to\nselect the application directory.\n\n1046\n00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:28,141\nNow, this right here, this application\ndirectory is also going to be the place\n\n1047\n00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:31,081\nwhere we're going to install it,\nwhen it does come time,\n\n1048\n00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:33,190\nthis is where we're going to install it.\n\n1049\n00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1050\n00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:39,584\n>> So we'll just say, yeah,\n\n1051\n00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:43,389\nC:Users/7zip.\n\n1052\n00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:51,493\nNow, every time when I did this,\nit'll throw up an error.\n\n1053\n00:53:51,493 --> 00:53:54,798\nAnd it'll say, hey, I'm sorry,\nI can't start the monitoring session,\n\n1054\n00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,290\ncuz it's gonna monitor all\nthe stuff in the background.\n\n1055\n00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,092\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1056\n00:53:58,092 --> 00:53:58,980\n>> Say OK.\n\n1057\n00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,810\nAnd then I just click on Next again.\n\n1058\n00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,830\nAnd it starts every time.\n\n1059\n00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,640\nSo, I don't know.\n\n1060\n00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,405\nTry and try again.\n\n1061\n00:54:08,405 --> 00:54:09,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there it goes.\n\n1062\n00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,980\nSo now, so\nit's gonna launch the application 7-Zip.\n\n1063\n00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,770\nAnd we'll just go through the,\ninstalling this guy here.\n\n1064\n00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:25,600\nAnd then we will change\nthis to C:\\Users\\7zip.\n\n1065\n00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,050\nAll right.\n\n1066\n00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,060\nClick on Next through,\nand install this guy.\n\n1067\n00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,236\nThere we go, that was pretty fast.\n\n1068\n00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:35,887\nAll right, so\n\n1069\n00:54:35,887 --> 00:54:40,875\nnow, if there are other additions\nonto this application that we wanted,\n\n1070\n00:54:42,795 --> 00:54:47,795\nexpansion packs or something else, we\nhave the opportunity now to do that here.\n\n1071\n00:54:47,795 --> 00:54:52,625\nWhich, on this one, we do not,\nso we are finished installing.\n\n1072\n00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:57,598\nSo now, it's gonna take all those changes\nthat 7-Zip made to the operating system\n\n1073\n00:54:57,598 --> 00:54:59,010\nand roll those guys up.\n\n1074\n00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,552\nSo, there we go.\n\n1075\n00:55:00,552 --> 00:55:01,329\nWe got those guys.\n\n1076\n00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:07,190\nNow, at this point, it wants us\nto run each of the applications\n\n1077\n00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,500\nto start them up, agree to the EULAs,\ndo the initial configuration,\n\n1078\n00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:17,290\navoid whatever else that we need\nis specific to that application.\n\n1079\n00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,890\nAnd so, we'll just run that file manager.\n\n1080\n00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,295\nThere we go,\nnothing else really to click or do.\n\n1081\n00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:25,820\nLet's set this guy up.\n\n1082\n00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,028\nClick on Next.\n\n1083\n00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:31,628\nAny changes, it'll collect those up,\nit made again.\n\n1084\n00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:33,566\nAnd that's it.\n\n1085\n00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:37,670\nAll right, so we will stop now.\n\n1086\n00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,339\nAnd then we will just save.\n\n1087\n00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,490\nSave that package.\n\n1088\n00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:44,700\n>> That file format looks like\nit might come up on the exam.\n\n1089\n00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,360\nApp-V?\n\n1090\n00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,310\nIs that the file extension, .AppV?\n\n1091\n00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:49,810\n>> Yep.\n\n1092\n00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:56,450\nAll right, so it throughout this warning,\nFiles excluded from the package.\n\n1093\n00:55:56,450 --> 00:56:01,357\nNow, earlier in the wizard, it gave us\nthe option to exclude certain files, or\n\n1094\n00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:04,380\ncertain directories that\nit would not collect.\n\n1095\n00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,120\nAnd in this one here.\n\n1096\n00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,050\nSo it's the app data local.\n\n1097\n00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,688\nThe local Microsoft stuff, so\n\n1098\n00:56:10,688 --> 00:56:14,027\nIf we excluded those directories\nduring the package process,\n\n1099\n00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:18,070\nwe wouldn't have gotten that one, but\nI think it's fine for our purposes.\n\n1100\n00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,620\nAnd so we're done with the sequencer.\n\n1101\n00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,430\nNow there is the package that it made.\n\n1102\n00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:30,040\nWe can browse in to that guy,\nand App-V package file.\n\n1103\n00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:35,303\nSo now what we'll do, is we'll copy\nthis guy off into a network share.\n\n1104\n00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,438\nThere we go.\n\n1105\n00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:50,650\nAll right, so now we've got\nour application package going.\n\n1106\n00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,270\nNow the next step of what\nwe'll do is we'll head over to\n\n1107\n00:56:55,270 --> 00:57:00,690\nthe server where I had\nthe App-V server installed.\n\n1108\n00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,980\nAnd from here we can add packages,\n\n1109\n00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:07,450\nmanage packages and publish them,\nall that kind of fun stuff.\n\n1110\n00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:14,997\nSo, to do this guy,\nwe will use a web browser to manage this.\n\n1111\n00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:28,167\nAll right, so, while installing\nthe application server there's\n\n1112\n00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:30,730\na couple of things that we had to set.\n\n1113\n00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:36,460\nWe had to set the port\nthat this guy runs on.\n\n1114\n00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,370\nSo I just set it at port 8080.\n\n1115\n00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:43,860\nWe also need to set the port for\nthe publishing server, I set that 8081.\n\n1116\n00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,580\nAnd then that reporting server,\nwhich I set to 8082.\n\n1117\n00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,529\n>> Gotcha.\nSo it doesn't conflict with any\n\n1118\n00:57:49,529 --> 00:57:52,461\nweb servers that might be\nwithin your infrastructure?\n\n1119\n00:57:52,461 --> 00:57:53,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Gotcha.\n\n1120\n00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,380\n>> Yeah and it's easy to remember.\n\n1121\n00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,145\n>> It sure is.\n\n1122\n00:57:55,145 --> 00:57:58,080\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n1123\n00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,880\nthis also requires a SQL database\nbehind to log all its stuff.\n\n1124\n00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,370\nAnd I guess whatever SQLy stuff that\nneeds to do, and so there we go.\n\n1125\n00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,755\nWe've got the applications in here.\n\n1126\n00:58:08,755 --> 00:58:15,346\nSo it's got this overview tab right,\noverview button selection guy.\n\n1127\n00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:19,840\nIt looks pretty neat, we've got\nSequencer and Library and Servers.\n\n1128\n00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,792\nYou know the buttons,\nthey don't really do anything.\n\n1129\n00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,440\nI mean click on Sequencer, and\nit just kind of tells me about it.\n\n1130\n00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,097\nAnd clicking on the package library just\ntakes me to the Library tab over there,\n\n1131\n00:58:33,097 --> 00:58:34,670\nand Clients.\n\n1132\n00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:38,348\nI don't know, I found it kind of amusing.\n\n1133\n00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,784\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so now let's go ahead and\n\n1134\n00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:43,700\nadd that package.\n\n1135\n00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,589\nClick on ADD, or UPGRADE PACKAGES.\n\n1136\n00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,544\nThen we'll browse.\n\n1137\n00:58:48,544 --> 00:58:57,446\n[SOUND] There's\n\n1138\n00:58:57,446 --> 00:59:01,470\nthat 7zip.8 App-V that Wes mentioned.\n\n1139\n00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,112\nOpen that guy up and we'll add it on.\n\n1140\n00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:11,060\nAll right, there we go,\nso 7-Zip is now added.\n\n1141\n00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,510\nNow that we've got the guy added in here.\n\n1142\n00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,590\nIt's not really gonna do us any good,\nit's just kinda sitting there hanging out.\n\n1143\n00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,810\nSo we do need to configure a couple\nof things to get this guy pushed out.\n\n1144\n00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:29,870\nWe have to set the access for it,\non who we want to be able to use it.\n\n1145\n00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:38,244\nAll right, I'm just gonna set\nthis guys to domain users.\n\n1146\n00:59:41,112 --> 00:59:45,800\n>> Nothing special here just\nany security principal or\n\n1147\n00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,111\nthe group you wanna share this with?\n\n1148\n00:59:49,111 --> 00:59:50,737\n>> Correct, correct.\n\n1149\n01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:03,115\nCome on, man.\n\n1150\n01:00:13,972 --> 01:00:14,935\nCheck, yeah.\n\n1151\n01:00:16,456 --> 01:00:22,986\n[LAUGH]\nAll right.\n\n1152\n01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:23,871\nAll right, last time.\n\n1153\n01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:33,809\nCheck, we're good, okay.\n\n1154\n01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:34,810\n>> Did you grant access?\n\n1155\n01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,960\n>> No, was that the button I needed, Wes?\n\n1156\n01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,460\n>> I think it is.\n\n1157\n01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:45,217\n>> Thank you, Wes.\n\n1158\n01:00:45,217 --> 01:00:47,450\nI am glad that you are on board for this.\n\n1159\n01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:47,999\n>> [LAUGH] Yes sir.\n\n1160\n01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:50,359\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Man, yeah,\n\n1161\n01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:51,910\nit's the little things sometimes.\n\n1162\n01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,740\n>> Yep. [CROSSTALK] >> All right,\nyes they are.\n\n1163\n01:00:54,740 --> 01:01:00,090\nSo there we go, we set our access for\nit, and we've set up connection groups.\n\n1164\n01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:04,670\nWe kind of, bind things together and\nmake it a bit easier to push out.\n\n1165\n01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,630\nAnd for this,\nwe will just publish this guy.\n\n1166\n01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,370\nAnd just like that, boom, published.\n\n1167\n01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,330\n>> Very cool.\n\n1168\n01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:14,840\n>> All right, so\nnow that the stuff is published out there,\n\n1169\n01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,080\nit still isn't really gonna do us any good\nuntil we have to set policies for it.\n\n1170\n01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:23,450\nSo we'll skip over to the domain\ncontroller for this one.\n\n1171\n01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,690\nNow, for the group policies,\n\n1172\n01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:32,830\nthey're not included in Windows,\nor it does include in server.\n\n1173\n01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:38,320\nSo to get those guys,\nyou have to go out and\n\n1174\n01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,604\ndownload those ADMX templates.\n\n1175\n01:01:42,604 --> 01:01:47,989\nWe'll just add maybe template ADMX.\n\n1176\n01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:57,600\nAll right, so Administrative Templates.\n\n1177\n01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,910\nSo we'll need this guy and\nyou can click through and download it.\n\n1178\n01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,410\nTo push these guys out,\nit would be best to use central store,\n\n1179\n01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,870\nonce you get those ADMX templates.\n\n1180\n01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,450\nTo put those guys in there.\n\n1181\n01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:15,630\nAnd of course those guys will\ngo once you download and\n\n1182\n01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:20,410\nunzip it, C:\\Windows, down there.\n\n1183\n01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:25,760\nAnd to Sysvol > Sysvol, your domain,\n\n1184\n01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:31,900\nPolicies, and then Policy Definitions.\n\n1185\n01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,820\nSo you'll dump those ADMX\ntemplates in here and\n\n1186\n01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:37,939\nthen the languages files\nADMLs will go in there.\n\n1187\n01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:41,786\nOnce you guys got those in there,\n\n1188\n01:02:41,786 --> 01:02:45,688\nthen they will appear in your\nGroup Policy and Management.\n\n1189\n01:02:45,688 --> 01:02:53,688\nAll right, so I created a new\ngroup policy object for this guy.\n\n1190\n01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:54,558\nAnd.\n\n1191\n01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:00,738\nWe're gonna edit that.\n\n1192\n01:03:00,738 --> 01:03:06,239\nNow where those settings are,\nthey will be in Computer Configuration,\n\n1193\n01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:12,160\nPolicies, and Administrative Templates,\nand in System, and App-V.\n\n1194\n01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,090\nNow the ones that we will be concerned for\nthis demo here and\n\n1195\n01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:19,092\nthe publishing server settings.\n\n1196\n01:03:19,092 --> 01:03:23,670\nAll right, so we set the publishing\nserver display name, right,\n\n1197\n01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:28,432\nthe display name, and then that\npublishing URL that we set earlier.\n\n1198\n01:03:28,432 --> 01:03:35,220\nAll right then, so\nthat http://ckbw-svr1:8081,\n\n1199\n01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:41,504\nall right, wanna refresh that guy,\nrefresh every hour.\n\n1200\n01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:44,890\nAnd we set those settings up.\n\n1201\n01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:49,220\nWe also set up the reporting servers,\nany scripting,\n\n1202\n01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:53,785\nif you want certain scripts to\nrun as those apps get pushed out.\n\n1203\n01:03:53,785 --> 01:03:54,750\n>> Okay.\n\n1204\n01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:58,317\n>> Streaming options and\nexperience improvement program,\n\n1205\n01:03:58,317 --> 01:04:01,380\nif you wanted to do that,\nI didn't configure it.\n\n1206\n01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,090\n>> No, really?\n\n1207\n01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,920\n>> Yeah, it-\n>> I like that the comment says, no.\n\n1208\n01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,550\n>> Yeah [LAUGH], it's a funny note.\n\n1209\n01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,885\nJay Burke, he's a big fan of that stuff.\n\n1210\n01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:12,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1211\n01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:14,110\n>> Jay Burke's like, you gotta do it.\n\n1212\n01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:17,700\nHow else is Microsoft gonna be\nable to improve their products\n\n1213\n01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,210\nif nobody participates in that stuff?\n\n1214\n01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:23,195\nBut I almost felt bad for never doing it.\n\n1215\n01:04:23,195 --> 01:04:24,470\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1216\n01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,240\n>> And so there we go.\n\n1217\n01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,140\nSo, we created it, and then I linked\nit to the GPO that has my users and\n\n1218\n01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:32,400\ncomputers in there.\n\n1219\n01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,340\nAnd we should be done with this part.\n\n1220\n01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,030\n>> Okay?\n>> The last part then is we will jump\n\n1221\n01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:38,190\nover to our client.\n\n1222\n01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:44,720\nAnd from our client,\nthere is an App-V Client,\n\n1223\n01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:50,320\nI guess little tidbit that, tidbit,\nprogram that you install on there.\n\n1224\n01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,720\nAnd with Windows 8.1 and\nthe new M dot package, the R2.\n\n1225\n01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,010\nIt does not include the client UI.\n\n1226\n01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,080\nA little program area.\n\n1227\n01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,420\nIt'll have to be downloaded separately.\n\n1228\n01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:09,666\nI have done that before the show.\n\n1229\n01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:12,000\n[SOUND]\n\n1230\n01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:24,541\n[SOUND].\n\n1231\n01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:27,403\nI thought I didn't.\n\n1232\n01:05:27,403 --> 01:05:29,083\nI do not see that guy in there.\n\n1233\n01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:40,583\nLet me check on this guy.\n\n1234\n01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:52,605\nAll right I got to stall on this one.\n\n1235\n01:05:52,605 --> 01:05:53,215\n>> There you go.\n\n1236\n01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,885\n>> All right so there's the UI program,\nafter it launches up.\n\n1237\n01:05:56,885 --> 01:06:02,345\nSo this is where you can get those\nat V packages, have been published.\n\n1238\n01:06:02,345 --> 01:06:05,812\nAll right and so on this guy,\nwe can click over here.\n\n1239\n01:06:05,812 --> 01:06:11,512\nNow I added Visio 2013, I thought that\nwould be kind of neat to push out.\n\n1240\n01:06:11,512 --> 01:06:13,562\nThat one, it doesn't work.\n\n1241\n01:06:13,562 --> 01:06:14,862\nIt doesn't appear.\n\n1242\n01:06:14,862 --> 01:06:18,017\nI'm not sure why yet,\nI didn't really dig into it.\n\n1243\n01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:18,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1244\n01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:19,740\n>> So we can update.\n\n1245\n01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:23,360\nSo it's going to reach out and\n\n1246\n01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,682\nI found a lot of this stuff,\nit does take a little bit of time.\n\n1247\n01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:27,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It does take a little bit of time\n\n1248\n01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:31,420\njust to get things working and\nthere's in-tune stuff.\n\n1249\n01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,213\n>> Yes.\n>> I was telling you about in-tune apps.\n\n1250\n01:06:33,213 --> 01:06:35,810\n>> Yes.\n>> And it just was not working and\n\n1251\n01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:36,860\nI did not understand.\n\n1252\n01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,300\nI was doing everything right.\n\n1253\n01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,350\nAnd the next day it just started working.\n\n1254\n01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,880\n>> Yeah, I remember that was frustration\nbecause we're sitting there, and\n\n1255\n01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,910\nhe's trying to figure out why isn't\nthis infrastructure setting up.\n\n1256\n01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:51,430\nI had the same issue go on, keep in mind,\nand we're gonna talk about towards the end\n\n1257\n01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,140\nof this episode,\nwe'll talk a little bit more about it too.\n\n1258\n01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,140\nBut when you publish some\nof these applications,\n\n1259\n01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,510\nespecially with the cloud-based services.\n\n1260\n01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:01,850\nThere is stuff in the cloud here that\nthey've gotta do to finalize being able to\n\n1261\n01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:05,020\ndeploy that application\nto different clients.\n\n1262\n01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,550\nAnd again,\nit could take a little bit of time.\n\n1263\n01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,710\nAnd that's one of things especially\nwith a cloud-based service is for\n\n1264\n01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:13,180\nthe most part it's gonna\nbe fairly seamless.\n\n1265\n01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:14,410\nBut it does take them\na little bit of time for\n\n1266\n01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:18,325\nthem to do whatever it is they need\nto do out there behind the curtains.\n\n1267\n01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:19,345\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> In the cloud.\n\n1268\n01:07:19,345 --> 01:07:21,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1269\n01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:25,900\nYeah, and this thing is still\nupdating to pull that thing down.\n\n1270\n01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,980\nAnd once it finishes, then go and click.\n\n1271\n01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:31,300\nWell, actually maybe we\ncan just click over there.\n\n1272\n01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,120\nAll right, so virtual apps.\n\n1273\n01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:38,365\nNow, the one that I did\npush out is the Audacity.\n\n1274\n01:07:38,365 --> 01:07:40,800\n>> Mm-hmm.\n>> And it you'd chop up and and\n\n1275\n01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,425\ndo music stuff.\n\n1276\n01:07:41,425 --> 01:07:42,110\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n1277\n01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:44,340\n>> With that pretty fancy.\n\n1278\n01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:44,940\nIt did finish.\n\n1279\n01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,350\nIt has not pulled down that\nseven zip we just created yet.\n\n1280\n01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:51,090\nSo, let's say all right, so\nwe ready for offline use.\n\n1281\n01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:56,940\nIt is a cashless program, if I pulled\na network adapter or I take the laptop\n\n1282\n01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:01,550\nhome with me, I'll still be able to,\nstill be able to use this program.\n\n1283\n01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,409\nI mean, fire this guy up.\n\n1284\n01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:08,880\nAnd it's gonna function just like-\n>> Just like\n\n1285\n01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,395\na normal app natively installed.\n\n1286\n01:08:10,395 --> 01:08:11,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It doesn't look any different.\n\n1287\n01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,020\nThat's really cool.\n\n1288\n01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:13,900\nVery cool.\n\n1289\n01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,280\n>> Now,\nlet's say something happens to it and\n\n1290\n01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,730\nit breaks, or we lose the shortcut\non the desktop, right?\n\n1291\n01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:24,860\nWell, this repair button here\nwill then go and reach out and\n\n1292\n01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,380\nrepair everything, and so there's that.\n\n1293\n01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,440\n>> That's really neat.\n\n1294\n01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,840\nThat's really cool.\n\n1295\n01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:34,930\n>> So that, yeah,\nI guess that's kind of it.\n\n1296\n01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,030\n>> Yep.\n>> For that guy.\n\n1297\n01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:38,240\n>> Yeah, it's really cool how it works.\n\n1298\n01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:42,105\nSome of the technologies,\nlike you said, with RemoteApp and\n\n1299\n01:08:42,105 --> 01:08:46,330\nApp-V they look they're installed locally.\n\n1300\n01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,880\nA client really wouldn't be able to tell\nany different with those two applications.\n\n1301\n01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,880\nAnd like I said,\nthat's one of things at help desk\n\n1302\n01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,250\nthat you might have to deal with\nwhen you're dealing with Hyper V.\n\n1303\n01:08:55,250 --> 01:09:02,440\nHyper V does allow you to run this\nprogram kind of like App-V does offline.\n\n1304\n01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,650\nBut then you have to try and\nexplain a virtual machine.\n\n1305\n01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:06,550\nThis, you do not.\n\n1306\n01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:10,820\nRemote app, app fee, it looks like\na native program on their computer and\n\n1307\n01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,900\nthey really can't tell.\n\n1308\n01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:16,560\nWhen it comes to customer experience,\nthey don't really know that, for instance,\n\n1309\n01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,360\nin a remote app that it's running\non a completely different computer.\n\n1310\n01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,594\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So very cool customer experience.\n\n1311\n01:09:22,594 --> 01:09:24,048\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Especially with Audacity.\n\n1312\n01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:24,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n[LAUGH].\n\n1313\n01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,062\n>> I haven't seen that program in a while.\n\n1314\n01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:27,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1315\n01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,280\nYeah, pretty fancy.\n\n1316\n01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,860\nI use it for, yeah.\n\n1317\n01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,613\n>> Demonstration purposes.\n\n1318\n01:09:32,613 --> 01:09:34,680\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah, all the good stuff.\n\n1319\n01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,820\n>> There we go.\n\n1320\n01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:40,100\n>> All right,yeah,\nthat's App-V in a nutshell.\n\n1321\n01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,520\nOf course, which all these technologies.\n\n1322\n01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,200\nThere's so much more to it.\n\n1323\n01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,640\nAnd you'd really get into it and\ndo things.\n\n1324\n01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:54,390\nOf course for our purposes, we just,\nwhat it is, how to use it and that.\n\n1325\n01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,320\nOkay let's see if it's pulled off\nthat 7Zip yet, and it has not.\n\n1326\n01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,850\nOkay, Wes, well,\nwe're coming up on a break here.\n\n1327\n01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,250\n>> Okay\n>> And\n\n1328\n01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,030\ndo you have anything else to\nadd about App-V and stuff?\n\n1329\n01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:09,070\n>> No not at all.\n\n1330\n01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:13,220\n>> Sweet, all right so\nwe've got the last one lined up.\n\n1331\n01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:18,000\nThe user experience virtualization,\nand last Intune.\n\n1332\n01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,760\nWhich you kind of tacked\non there at the end.\n\n1333\n01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,320\n>> Yup.\n\n1334\n01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,120\n>> All right.\n\n1335\n01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,625\n>> Yeah.\n>> So we'll get on that after the break.\n\n1336\n01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:33,916\n[SOUND].\n\n1337\n01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:36,145\nAll right, welcome welcome back.\n\n1338\n01:10:36,145 --> 01:10:38,734\nAll right.\nSo the last that we have light up is UEV,\n\n1339\n01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:39,745\n>> mm-hm\n\n1340\n01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:40,285\n>> User\n\n1341\n01:10:40,285 --> 01:10:42,405\nExperience Virtualization\n>> Yep.\n\n1342\n01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,065\n>> And tack onto the end.\n\n1343\n01:10:45,065 --> 01:10:47,830\n>> Yep, definitely\n>> Now, with UEV,\n\n1344\n01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:52,095\nit's also part of the MDOP package, and\n\n1345\n01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:57,160\nUE-V is a little different than what we've\nbeen talking about before, and not so\n\n1346\n01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:02,794\nmuch of application compatibility or\nbeing able to fix broken applications.\n\n1347\n01:11:02,794 --> 01:11:06,780\nBut, this is about syncing settings and\n\n1348\n01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:11,965\nsyncing application settings\njust with your user profile.\n\n1349\n01:11:11,965 --> 01:11:12,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1350\n01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:20,610\nIt's an enterprise level user state,\nif you will, virtualization tool.\n\n1351\n01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:24,590\nWe've got some of the technologies, well\none technology that's been around windows\n\n1352\n01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:28,740\na very long time in Windows,\nis roaming profiles.\n\n1353\n01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,540\nThe problem with roaming profiles, though.\n\n1354\n01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:36,900\nRoaming profiles can take a lot,\ncan accrue a lot of space on your servers.\n\n1355\n01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,200\nAnd can really hinder network performance.\n\n1356\n01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,990\nWell, what does a roaming profile do,\nyou might ask?\n\n1357\n01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:45,780\nWell, it synchronizes the user's\nentire profile, all their folders,\n\n1358\n01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,190\nall their settings up\nto a network location.\n\n1359\n01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,516\nNow, when a user goes\nto another computer and\n\n1360\n01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,465\nthey want to have that consistent desktop,\nthat consistent experience,\n\n1361\n01:11:54,465 --> 01:11:56,500\nthey've got to synchronize\nthose settings down.\n\n1362\n01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,800\nThey've got to pull every\none of those settings down.\n\n1363\n01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,170\nAll the documents, all their settings,\nand again, this can take a while.\n\n1364\n01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:08,680\nSo, roaming profiles, one of the benefit\nis, it's built into Windows.\n\n1365\n01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,150\nWe don't have to add\nthird party utilities.\n\n1366\n01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:12,680\nWe don't have to have volume licensing.\n\n1367\n01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,490\nWe don't have to go out, and\nfigure out how we're gonna get MDOP.\n\n1368\n01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:18,380\nSo, it does have it's place in the fact\nthat you don't have to have third\n\n1369\n01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,920\nparty software.\n\n1370\n01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,520\nIt does have some of it's drawbacks,\nbecause of the amount of information\n\n1371\n01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,320\nthat it needs to pull down to\napply that user state, and\n\n1372\n01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,300\nthat customer experience, if you will.\n\n1373\n01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,720\nIt can hinder the overall experience and\n\n1374\n01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:36,255\nit can, it can definitely have\nsome performance hindrance.\n\n1375\n01:12:36,255 --> 01:12:41,520\n>> Yeah, now the Microsoft account,\nthe Microsoft account on Windows 8.\n\n1376\n01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,510\n>> Yep.\n>> It also synchs settings.\n\n1377\n01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:44,180\n>> It does.\n\n1378\n01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:48,510\n>> Now, one thing with the UEV,\n\n1379\n01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:52,472\nUEV requires a domain account to work.\n\n1380\n01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:54,757\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The Microsoft account does not.\n\n1381\n01:12:54,757 --> 01:12:55,724\n>> Yep.\n>> All right.\n\n1382\n01:12:55,724 --> 01:12:59,668\nThe Microsoft account,\nit also requires internet access,\n\n1383\n01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:02,290\ncuz everything is synced in the cloud.\n\n1384\n01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:04,463\n>> Yes.\n>> As where UEV does not,\n\n1385\n01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,110\nit doesn't need the internet.\n\n1386\n01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:10,175\nJust on the local network that it needs.\n\n1387\n01:13:10,175 --> 01:13:11,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1388\n01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:14,410\n>> So those things separate the two apart.\n\n1389\n01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:16,630\n>> And that's one of the limitations\nto the Microsoft account.\n\n1390\n01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,650\nUnless you join it to a domain account,\n\n1391\n01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:22,430\nit's the only way to synchronize settings\nacross non-domain joined computers.\n\n1392\n01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:25,190\nSo, if these computers aren't\njoined to the domain, yes,\n\n1393\n01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:27,930\nMicrosoft account might be the way to go.\n\n1394\n01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:32,630\nIf you are in a domain, which is why we'd\nprobably be using UEV to begin with,\n\n1395\n01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:34,570\nis we're in a large corporation.\n\n1396\n01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,450\nAgain, we could use what's been built\ninto windows, the roaming profile.\n\n1397\n01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:41,940\nBut there again, it can cost some\nbandwidth issues, it can cuz a latency or\n\n1398\n01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,920\ndelay in that consistent platform.\n\n1399\n01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,700\nAnd that's where we start to think about\nusing that User Experience Virtualization,\n\n1400\n01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:52,940\nbecause it can synchronize\nacross multiple platforms.\n\n1401\n01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:58,170\nAnd again, it does have some of the\nbenefits here that we're gonna talk about,\n\n1402\n01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:01,760\nsome of the performance games\nthat we can get when we use UVV.\n\n1403\n01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,940\nI always wanna say EUV, but EVV.\n\n1404\n01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:04,910\n>> EVV.\n\n1405\n01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,960\nSomething else with UVV, and\n\n1406\n01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,200\nthat is pretty sweet, is it can sync\nsettings with virtualized apps.\n\n1407\n01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,539\n>> Yes.\n>> So our V-Apps,\n\n1408\n01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:14,780\nit can sync the settings in there.\n\n1409\n01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:19,880\nNow, the apps that we have don't have\nany crazy stuff, but if there was\n\n1410\n01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:25,130\nsome particular line of business app and\nsome customization or some tool bar,\n\n1411\n01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:31,130\nit will sync that setting\nacross your other profiles.\n\n1412\n01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:33,148\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that's roaming profiles,\n\n1413\n01:14:33,148 --> 01:14:34,170\nthey can't do it.\n\n1414\n01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,310\nNothing else can do that, just UEV.\n\n1415\n01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,890\nSo if-\n>> That's a great point there.\n\n1416\n01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:41,120\nI was thinking about\nvirtualization to physical.\n\n1417\n01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,010\nPhysical to virtual.\n\n1418\n01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,470\nAnd you think, well wait a second,\nwhat are you talking about, guys?\n\n1419\n01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,140\nPhysical to virtual, virtual to physical?\n\n1420\n01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:46,890\nWell, think about this.\n\n1421\n01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:48,800\nThink about you go to work, and\n\n1422\n01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,890\nat work they're deploying something known\nas a VDI, virtual desktop infrastructure.\n\n1423\n01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:57,500\nAll right, so\nyour desktop isn't on your local machine.\n\n1424\n01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,970\nIt's actually running across the network.\n\n1425\n01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:02,960\nBut then you decide,\nwell maybe I want to take my laptop home.\n\n1426\n01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,980\nI've got my laptop, my company laptop,\nbut I'm not using a virtualized desktop.\n\n1427\n01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:10,470\nOf a structure I'm using\na physical machine.\n\n1428\n01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,470\nSo again, this is where, like Nate says,\n\n1429\n01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:16,140\nyou get that virtual again\nto physical environment, and\n\n1430\n01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:21,026\nUEV can again, synchronize that\nexperience, or those settings if you will.\n\n1431\n01:15:21,026 --> 01:15:21,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1432\n01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:26,110\nNow, UEV does require a client\nto be installed locally\n\n1433\n01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,550\non the machine that you wanna sync with.\n\n1434\n01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:31,295\nTo sync your settings.\n\n1435\n01:15:31,295 --> 01:15:32,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Of course\n\n1436\n01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,310\nMicrosoft account does not need a client.\n\n1437\n01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,990\nYou're a roaming profile.\n\n1438\n01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,030\nDoesn't need its own client.\n\n1439\n01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:38,640\nUEV it does.\n\n1440\n01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,240\n>> Yeah, anything else to-\n>> Well,\n\n1441\n01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,780\none of the things I was also thinking too.\n\n1442\n01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:49,230\nIs like with roaming profiles,\nit's typically an all or nothing.\n\n1443\n01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:55,600\nYou either sync everything, or you again\nstore everything, or you store nothing.\n\n1444\n01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,450\nUEV on the other hand gives\nthe administrator the ability to select,\n\n1445\n01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:01,310\nwhat settings they're gonna synchronize?\n\n1446\n01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,700\nAnd it doesn't have to be an all or\nnothing.\n\n1447\n01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,790\nIt could be these specific settings and\nnothing else, or\n\n1448\n01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:07,310\nit can be everything else.\n\n1449\n01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:11,940\nNow, keep in mind that it only\nsynchronizes user state data.\n\n1450\n01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,330\nIt doesn't synchronize your folders,\nyour documents.\n\n1451\n01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:21,220\nKeep in mind that if you want the data to\ngo, that's where roaming profiles goes in.\n\n1452\n01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,850\nBut it's probably even better\nimplementation that if you wanna sync user\n\n1453\n01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:29,440\ndata as well, like your documents,\nyour desktop, that you're gonna\n\n1454\n01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,600\nuse something called photo redirection,\nthat we'll talk about at another time.\n\n1455\n01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,048\nSo again, just user settings, and\nsome windows settings, not user data.\n\n1456\n01:16:37,048 --> 01:16:40,250\nIf you wanna implement user data,\nyou got to, or synchronize user data,\n\n1457\n01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,080\nyou got to use folder redirection for\nthat.\n\n1458\n01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,825\nSo there is some things\nthat it doesn't do.\n\n1459\n01:16:43,825 --> 01:16:45,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1460\n01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,640\n>> Yeah.\nWhy don't we say, yeah.\n\n1461\n01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,600\nLet's get into it and see.\n\n1462\n01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,330\n>> See what it looks like?\n\n1463\n01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:49,870\n>> Yeah.\nSee how it works.\n\n1464\n01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:50,780\n>> Definitely.\n\n1465\n01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,870\n>> All right.\n\n1466\n01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:55,160\nSo to push this stuff out into policy,\n\n1467\n01:16:55,160 --> 01:17:00,920\nof course you will need those ADMX Files,\nand it was included with the app B stuff.\n\n1468\n01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,070\nIt is already there.\n\n1469\n01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:04,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We skip over to the domain\n\n1470\n01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,280\ncontrol here, right?\n\n1471\n01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:12,360\nAnd I created a policy down here\ncalled UEV, and we can edit this guy.\n\n1472\n01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:20,512\nThen those policies,\nadministrative templates Windows\n\n1473\n01:17:20,512 --> 01:17:26,590\ncomponents, and\nMicrosoft user experience virtualization.\n\n1474\n01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:31,490\nAll right, so\nin here we can set certain settings on\n\n1475\n01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:35,500\nwhat we want to control and\neven turn the guy on.\n\n1476\n01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,570\nSo, down near the bottom,\nused UEV, well yeah sure.\n\n1477\n01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,590\nWe can enable that.\n\n1478\n01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:43,180\nI think that is one of the ones\nthat we should push out.\n\n1479\n01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:44,490\nNow, we do have these.\n\n1480\n01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:47,550\nActually we'll come back to that one.\n\n1481\n01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:50,381\n>> Right.\n>> The settings storage path on where we\n\n1482\n01:17:50,381 --> 01:17:52,810\nwant these settings, things to go.\n\n1483\n01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,958\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you have a network share and\n\n1484\n01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:59,357\nyou have the proper permission set on\nto where people can write to it, but\n\n1485\n01:17:59,357 --> 01:18:04,045\nothers can't browse to it, and\nyou grab your settings or what-not.\n\n1486\n01:18:04,045 --> 01:18:06,285\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can set that up on there.\n\n1487\n01:18:06,285 --> 01:18:10,565\nAnd so here, I've set it now for\nthe .net files,\n\n1488\n01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:14,155\npro files and\nthen percent username percent.\n\n1489\n01:18:14,155 --> 01:18:16,805\nDo you know what the percents?\n\n1490\n01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:17,905\n>> Yeah, those are variables.\n\n1491\n01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:18,795\nThose are the variables.\n\n1492\n01:18:18,795 --> 01:18:20,185\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Those say whatever the username is,\n\n1493\n01:18:20,185 --> 01:18:21,760\nthis is where we're gonna sync it so.\n\n1494\n01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,000\nIf it was my username it would fill it in.\n\n1495\n01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,646\nWith the percent username\nin there in means,\n\n1496\n01:18:26,646 --> 01:18:32,090\nwell if you're looking for W Brian that's\nthe account, synchronize it to W Brian.\n\n1497\n01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:38,690\nIf your Nate Copeland, N Copeland\nthat's your name, your username.\n\n1498\n01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:41,290\nGo ahead and\nsynchronize it to that location.\n\n1499\n01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:41,830\n>> Yeah, easy.\n>> So\n\n1500\n01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:46,170\nthe variables you don't have to define\nthe specific one, you just say, All.\n\n1501\n01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:47,790\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Yep.\n\n1502\n01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:50,462\nSo, we've got that guy set in there.\n\n1503\n01:18:50,462 --> 01:18:52,675\nAll right, so that's where\nthe settings are going to be stored.\n\n1504\n01:18:52,675 --> 01:18:55,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now, I saw this settings template\n\n1505\n01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,230\ncatalog path.\n\n1506\n01:18:56,230 --> 01:19:00,539\nNow these settings template catalog,\nthis is where we can set\n\n1507\n01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:08,980\nCustom Settings, and\nstore those in a location, a catalogue\n\n1508\n01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:14,520\nthat we can then pull up and use those\nsettings along with our UEV stuff.\n\n1509\n01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,440\nAnd here we've got files and templates.\n\n1510\n01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,160\nAnd where those guys will be stored.\n\n1511\n01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,260\nSo you got that turned on.\n\n1512\n01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,145\nRoam Windows Settings.\n\n1513\n01:19:25,145 --> 01:19:26,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1514\n01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:31,595\n>> So, in here, with this guy enabled,\nwe can synchronize Synchronize our desktop\n\n1515\n01:19:31,595 --> 01:19:37,175\nsettings, ease of access settings if we\nhad any, and the themes that you have.\n\n1516\n01:19:37,175 --> 01:19:38,617\nStuff in there that we can turn on.\n\n1517\n01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:39,794\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1518\n01:19:39,794 --> 01:19:43,955\n>> So you've got that guy all edited out,\nand we got it linked up.\n\n1519\n01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:48,757\nAll right, and so that's really all that\nwe need on the domain controller side.\n\n1520\n01:19:48,757 --> 01:19:49,605\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1521\n01:19:49,605 --> 01:19:51,835\n>> All right, and\nlet's jump over to client.\n\n1522\n01:19:51,835 --> 01:19:55,810\nNow, for\nthe settings to sync across one another,\n\n1523\n01:19:55,810 --> 01:20:01,548\nif you're logged in twice like I am\nright now on Client 1 and on Client 2.\n\n1524\n01:20:01,548 --> 01:20:05,418\nIt's not gonna work, so\nyou have to be signed out of one or\n\n1525\n01:20:05,418 --> 01:20:08,090\nat least have the work station locked.\n\n1526\n01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:11,390\nIf you're syncing anything\nwith applications,\n\n1527\n01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:15,910\nthen that application will also need to be\nclosed down for its settings to sync, so\n\n1528\n01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:18,180\nI would just lock that guy.\n\n1529\n01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,210\nSo it's good, so\nif you notice the background was blue.\n\n1530\n01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:24,890\nHopefully it changes and\neverything works like it did.\n\n1531\n01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:27,540\n>> It's blue.\nIt'll run good, it's blue.\n\n1532\n01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,710\n>> All right, oh that's right, man.\n\n1533\n01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:31,294\nYou pull that out every time.\n\n1534\n01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:34,462\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1535\n01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:35,415\nSo there we go.\n\n1536\n01:20:35,415 --> 01:20:40,492\nNow it says we'll go ahead and\nwork in your third machine here, and\n\n1537\n01:20:40,492 --> 01:20:47,400\nwe will just simply change the background,\npersonalize, and let's change it to black.\n\n1538\n01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:53,220\nAll right there we go, so\nwe got our little black background here.\n\n1539\n01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,320\nAnd now there is the client.\n\n1540\n01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,840\nOh look there's the App V client.\n\n1541\n01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,160\nI thought it wasn't on there.\n\n1542\n01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,020\nAll right.\n\n1543\n01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:05,900\nSo at the company settings center,\nnow this will be the UE-V client\n\n1544\n01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,640\nthat runs locally on here that\nsyncs all of your setting up.\n\n1545\n01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,240\nWe see sync status, right?\n\n1546\n01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,280\nScreen, everything works.\n\n1547\n01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,180\nWe got some help stuff here.\n\n1548\n01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:18,920\nAnd Windows settings, and Wes,\nin the beginning, it used to display\n\n1549\n01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,220\nall the Windows settings that were\nbeing synced below there, but\n\n1550\n01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:23,950\nit just doesn't anymore.\n\n1551\n01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:24,940\n>> Aw, man.\n\n1552\n01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:28,230\n>> So we've got allocation\nsettings that we can set here.\n\n1553\n01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:33,050\nNow, as Wes mentioned earlier,\nwith the user profiles,\n\n1554\n01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:36,250\nyou can't pick, or\nroaming profiles, sorry.\n\n1555\n01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,990\nYou can't pick what goes out and\nwhat comes in.\n\n1556\n01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:40,858\n>> No selective nature, all or nothing.\n\n1557\n01:21:40,858 --> 01:21:45,663\n>> All or nothing, and\nyou can kind of sort of control how or\n\n1558\n01:21:45,663 --> 01:21:51,696\nwhere it sync with primary computers\nwhere you can say hey, when I sign\n\n1559\n01:21:51,696 --> 01:21:57,645\nonto this do not pull my profile\ndone because it profile stays there.\n\n1560\n01:21:57,645 --> 01:21:58,860\nIt doesn't leave.\n\n1561\n01:21:58,860 --> 01:21:59,600\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n1562\n01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,930\nFor instance, maybe I have a home.\n\n1563\n01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,400\nHave a home, hey, imagine that.\n\n1564\n01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,510\nI have this office, right?\n\n1565\n01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:07,360\nAnd that's where I work most of the time.\n\n1566\n01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,800\nBut then I go to another, like maybe\nanother room within the building.\n\n1567\n01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,200\nAnd there's a maybe computer\nthat a lot of people use.\n\n1568\n01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:17,050\nWell I might say that I\ndon't want any settings\n\n1569\n01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:22,360\non that computer that everybody's using,\nsynchronizing back to my office computer.\n\n1570\n01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:27,520\nSo inside of Active Directory you can\nstate, or you can set what is known.\n\n1571\n01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,530\nNate already mentioned here\nwhat is the primary computer\n\n1572\n01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:32,390\nactive directory attribute.\n\n1573\n01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,260\nOr something,\nI think that's what it's called.\n\n1574\n01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:37,260\nAnd it says okay,\nthis is my primary computer, and\n\n1575\n01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:40,860\nwhen I manipulate settings here\nthis is what I want you to choose.\n\n1576\n01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,318\nBut when I go to this computer,\ndon't even consider it.\n\n1577\n01:22:43,318 --> 01:22:44,056\n>> Yeah.\n\n1578\n01:22:44,056 --> 01:22:45,900\n>> Sweet stuff.\n\n1579\n01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:51,730\n>> Now with UEV, it can sync desktop\napps and your modern UI style apps.\n\n1580\n01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:52,650\nIf we scroll down here,\n\n1581\n01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:57,350\nwe got Microsoft.BingTravel,\nMicrosoft.BingSports.\n\n1582\n01:22:57,350 --> 01:23:01,300\nSo it can synchronize\nsettings within those UI.\n\n1583\n01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,660\nYour modern UI style apps.\n\n1584\n01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:08,040\nAnd I mentioned that it\nalso sync virtualized apps.\n\n1585\n01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,230\nLike our App-V package.\n\n1586\n01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:14,110\nAll right so\nwe've got this Audacity program here.\n\n1587\n01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:18,100\nNow, for\nit to synchronize a virtualized app,\n\n1588\n01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:23,650\nyou first have to install the app locally,\nwhich I have done here.\n\n1589\n01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:25,620\nI don't need to pull it up, but\n\n1590\n01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:31,260\nI installed Audacity locally on this\nmachine, and once it is on there,\n\n1591\n01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:38,060\nthere is another tool called the User\nExperience Virtualization Generator.\n\n1592\n01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:41,290\nAnd this right here will\nthen build a template\n\n1593\n01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:44,870\nthat we can then stick in the catalog and\nsynch all that stuff up.\n\n1594\n01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,310\nSo we'll just kind of\nclick through this guy.\n\n1595\n01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:50,490\nCreate a settings template.\n\n1596\n01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:54,998\nAll right, so specify the file path of\nthe application that we're going to use.\n\n1597\n01:23:54,998 --> 01:24:01,220\nAnd so we'll drill down into here,\nprogram files, Audacity remember.\n\n1598\n01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:04,660\nAll right, and so,\nbecause you have to find that executable,\n\n1599\n01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:07,660\nyou have to have it\ninstalled locally first.\n\n1600\n01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,970\nAnd then, it will sync up settings.\n\n1601\n01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:14,020\nSo we'll just say open up and\nwe'll click on Next here.\n\n1602\n01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,250\nWhen you click Next, the discover\nlocations window will open, and\n\n1603\n01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:21,200\nit will listen, kind of like how\nthe sequencer listens out there.\n\n1604\n01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:24,850\nAnd it'll find where this\napplication is calling to,\n\n1605\n01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:30,320\nfind those locations to listen for\nany changes.\n\n1606\n01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,690\n>> And while Nate's doing that,\n\n1607\n01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:35,922\nkeep in mind that what's running in\nthe background is called a UEV agent.\n\n1608\n01:24:35,922 --> 01:24:37,880\nAll right.\nThe software that we see here,\n\n1609\n01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,560\nthe agent behind it is\nsynchronizing these settings.\n\n1610\n01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,890\nAnd a settings location template\ndoesn't define the actual settings.\n\n1611\n01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:50,010\nBut it tells the UEV agent in that\ncompany setting, where do I look?\n\n1612\n01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:53,800\nI need to know where in the registry\nI look for these settings.\n\n1613\n01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,500\nAnd that's what this\ntemplate is generating.\n\n1614\n01:24:55,500 --> 01:25:00,095\nThe settings location template is\ntelling this agent, look here.\n\n1615\n01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,885\nThese are the settings that you're gonna\nmonitor when they start to change.\n\n1616\n01:25:03,885 --> 01:25:06,385\nSo that's what the Settings Location\ntemplates doing.\n\n1617\n01:25:06,385 --> 01:25:09,065\nKeep in mind that the catalog\nthat Nate mentioned\n\n1618\n01:25:09,065 --> 01:25:11,855\nis where these templates are stored.\n\n1619\n01:25:11,855 --> 01:25:13,175\nAnd when EU.\n\n1620\n01:25:13,175 --> 01:25:14,175\nSee?\nThere I go again.\n\n1621\n01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:17,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> UEV agent needs to figure out,\n\n1622\n01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:20,050\ndo I have some of these templates\nthat Nate's right here making?\n\n1623\n01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:23,860\nI need to look for the catalog to\nfind the template to begin with.\n\n1624\n01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:28,460\nAnd then I pull the template down, well I\nsay that, but the agent pulls it down, and\n\n1625\n01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:32,490\nwhen it knows, now it can figure out,\nokay now I know where to look, and\n\n1626\n01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:34,920\nwhat settings I need to monitor.\n\n1627\n01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,380\n>> Yeah, so here we go.\n\n1628\n01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,290\nIt found all that stuff.\n\n1629\n01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:39,930\nWe can just click on next through here.\n\n1630\n01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:44,480\nAnd so there's the stuff that it found.\n\n1631\n01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,600\nThe files that it is tracking.\n\n1632\n01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:52,440\nSo nothing to change there and then we\ncan add information on that we need to.\n\n1633\n01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,000\nFor this one, we will not.\n\n1634\n01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:59,960\nWe'll click on Create, and\nit will create that XML file,\n\n1635\n01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:06,989\nand for this,\nwe will stick this in that catalog path\n\n1636\n01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:12,220\ntemplates and I did this one earlier so\nthat's the guy right there.\n\n1637\n01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:14,110\nSo we'll just click Save,\n\n1638\n01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:17,420\nyeah sure we'll just override it,\nprobably doesn't break anymore.\n\n1639\n01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,830\n>> Now,\nI'm glad you actually did that because\n\n1640\n01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:23,920\nwhat if the the UEV generator\nhad looked earlier?\n\n1641\n01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,900\nAnd it looked at that template and\nnow it's got these settings and\n\n1642\n01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,940\nit's looking, because of the template,\nwhere do I look?\n\n1643\n01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:32,650\nNow it's telling me Audacity,\nhere's where I look.\n\n1644\n01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:34,720\nWhat if Nate had made an update?\n\n1645\n01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:38,120\nMaybe there was another setting\nthat it also wanted to monitor.\n\n1646\n01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:44,310\nWell that's an updated template now,\nand that's the purpose of the UEV\n\n1647\n01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:49,930\nlooking back to that catalog,\nalso for updated templates too.\n\n1648\n01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:54,870\n>> In our company setting center\nwe can see, which I did earlier so\n\n1649\n01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:59,930\nit is already there,\nthe audacity there is peering in there.\n\n1650\n01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:05,025\nSo we can close this guy out and\nwe can, fire this up.\n\n1651\n01:27:05,025 --> 01:27:07,980\nNow, I was running through\nthis beforehand, and you know,\n\n1652\n01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:14,830\nsome of the settings and things, they\ndidn't sync up as quickly as I wanted to.\n\n1653\n01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:15,670\n>> Okay.\n\n1654\n01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:18,920\n>> No, it does sync up,\nwhen you lock your computer.\n\n1655\n01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:22,053\n>> Sure.\n>> And it syncs out once a day at like by\n\n1656\n01:27:22,053 --> 01:27:25,680\ndefault once a day at like three-\n>> Yeah 3 AM.\n\n1657\n01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,610\n>> Three in the morning.\n\n1658\n01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:27,385\nSomething like that.\n\n1659\n01:27:27,385 --> 01:27:29,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They like 3 AM for everything.\n\n1660\n01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,105\n>> I know everything's three.\n\n1661\n01:27:30,105 --> 01:27:31,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just for\n\n1662\n01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,869\nthis then we will turn off these\nlast few little tool bars.\n\n1663\n01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:41,953\n>> Now as Nate's doing this,\nwhat's happening is that agent it\n\n1664\n01:27:41,953 --> 01:27:46,130\nchecked the template, and\nit said where do I need to look?\n\n1665\n01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:51,834\nAnd now it's monitoring those locations in\nthe template, and as Nathan clicks through\n\n1666\n01:27:51,834 --> 01:27:57,091\ndifferent locations it's monitoring that\nin the registry keeping track of it.\n\n1667\n01:27:57,091 --> 01:28:01,989\n>> Let's go back to our sitting there\nCome into your settings center here,\n\n1668\n01:28:01,989 --> 01:28:04,169\nand we'll say I just sync it up.\n\n1669\n01:28:04,169 --> 01:28:06,800\nWe want to tell it to make this change,\nall right, hooray, it worked.\n\n1670\n01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,880\nThat's really nice and\nfast, and so there we go.\n\n1671\n01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:15,154\nWe'll close, now lets say we are done with\nthis PC, if it's a shared PC or something.\n\n1672\n01:28:15,154 --> 01:28:15,757\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1673\n01:28:15,757 --> 01:28:20,546\n>> Then we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just sign out of this guy.\n\n1674\n01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:21,266\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1675\n01:28:21,266 --> 01:28:26,844\n>> All right there we go it's ready,\nwe should be done with it.\n\n1676\n01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:31,194\nAll right, so now we come up,\nwe've gone to our other PC here, and\n\n1677\n01:28:31,194 --> 01:28:36,039\nif everything works instantaneously\nthen it should sync your settings.\n\n1678\n01:28:36,039 --> 01:28:42,140\nWhen we sign into this guy, then it\nshould pull all those settings down, so.\n\n1679\n01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,590\n>> Now at this point, while he gets\nsigned in, keep in mind what's happening.\n\n1680\n01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:48,710\nThat agent,\nthat UE-V agent in the background,\n\n1681\n01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:53,910\nit's going to reach out to that\nsettings storage location.\n\n1682\n01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:57,670\nIf you remember in the policy\nthere that Nate was configuring,\n\n1683\n01:28:57,670 --> 01:29:00,480\nit had a settings storage location.\n\n1684\n01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:04,085\nAnd I know that it starts to\nget a little twisty here, but\n\n1685\n01:29:04,085 --> 01:29:08,690\nwhat the agent is gonna do is it's\nnow gonna check that settings storage\n\n1686\n01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:11,788\nlocation to see if\nthere's updated settings.\n\n1687\n01:29:11,788 --> 01:29:14,105\nAnd it's gonna then turn around and\napply them to the machine.\n\n1688\n01:29:14,105 --> 01:29:15,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So they don't make it easy,\n\n1689\n01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:20,000\nyou've got to have, what is that,\nsettings, storage location, that's where\n\n1690\n01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,860\nI'm going to, the agent itself is gonna\nstore any settings that it finds.\n\n1691\n01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:26,325\nYou've got the settings\ntemplate catalogue,\n\n1692\n01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:28,671\nthat's where all the templates are stored.\n\n1693\n01:29:28,671 --> 01:29:31,885\nThen you've got the settings\nlocation template itself, and\n\n1694\n01:29:31,885 --> 01:29:35,479\nthat defines where we look for\nthe settings within the application.\n\n1695\n01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:38,022\nOf course they didn't make\nit easy on us on this one.\n\n1696\n01:29:38,022 --> 01:29:42,769\n>> Yeah, yep, but\nonce we got signed in on this guy,\n\n1697\n01:29:42,769 --> 01:29:48,670\nit did pull down,\nit has the black background as before.\n\n1698\n01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:51,400\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, very good.\n>> And let's fire up Audacity and\n\n1699\n01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,379\nsee if all those toolbars are there.\n\n1700\n01:29:54,379 --> 01:29:58,095\n>> That's okay,\nit hasn't synchronized the settings yet.\n\n1701\n01:29:58,095 --> 01:29:59,250\n>> Mm-hm, nope.\n\n1702\n01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:03,391\nAll right,\nwell it got the background in there,\n\n1703\n01:30:03,391 --> 01:30:07,790\nand so yeah, and that's how UE-V works.\n\n1704\n01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:11,540\n>> And\nit provides you with that consistent\n\n1705\n01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:14,280\nexperience regardless of\nwhat platform you're on.\n\n1706\n01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,970\nLike it said, in an environment where\nyou've got maybe limited network\n\n1707\n01:30:18,970 --> 01:30:23,410\nbandwidth, keep in mind that it could take\na second to synchronize these settings up,\n\n1708\n01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:24,408\nit's not going to happen right away.\n\n1709\n01:30:24,408 --> 01:30:28,829\nAnd especially with like we're gonna\ntalk about in a second with Intune,\n\n1710\n01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:32,490\nsome of the things might not\nbe available right away.\n\n1711\n01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:35,260\nAnd you might just need some\ntime to let the infrastructure\n\n1712\n01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:38,495\nbehind to synchronize everything up and\nprovide that consistency.\n\n1713\n01:30:38,495 --> 01:30:40,340\n>> Mm-hm, all right.\n\n1714\n01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,890\nSo last little bit, Windows Intune.\n\n1715\n01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:47,460\nNow, this isn't really I wouldn't\nquite see it as syncing settings or\n\n1716\n01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,655\neven application coexistence.\n\n1717\n01:30:49,655 --> 01:30:50,208\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1718\n01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:53,350\n>> More like just deploying\napps through the cloud.\n\n1719\n01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:57,750\n>> Electronic software distribution, ESD.\n\n1720\n01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,370\n>> ESD.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1721\n01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,190\n>> That sounds good.\n\n1722\n01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,530\n>> [LAUGH] That sounds good enough for me.\n\n1723\n01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:03,970\n>> Right.\n>> What if I want to deploy\n\n1724\n01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:08,220\napplications to devices that\nare sometimes on my network,\n\n1725\n01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:09,930\nsometimes they're in other locations.\n\n1726\n01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:13,650\nBut I still want to make sure that the\npeople that need those applications have\n\n1727\n01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:18,350\naccess to them, even if they're not on\nthe devices that are inside of my network.\n\n1728\n01:31:18,350 --> 01:31:20,860\nNow they can be inside\nof your network too, but\n\n1729\n01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:22,180\nwhat happens when they leave your network?\n\n1730\n01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,946\nAnd this is where Intune\nreally starts to shine,\n\n1731\n01:31:23,946 --> 01:31:26,887\nin the fact that I don't even have to be\nin the physical location of the building.\n\n1732\n01:31:26,887 --> 01:31:29,484\nI don't have to be in the physical\nlocation of the network, and\n\n1733\n01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:32,724\nI can still make sure that those end users\nget the applications that they need.\n\n1734\n01:31:32,724 --> 01:31:34,135\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1735\n01:31:34,135 --> 01:31:41,830\nNow, I've got an Intune trial account\nset up with some apps already in there.\n\n1736\n01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,555\nWe can take a look at that.\n\n1737\n01:31:44,555 --> 01:31:48,410\nNow, so yeah,\nit's in my opinion a little out of order\n\n1738\n01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:51,270\nin how we're gonna\nintroduce Windows Intune.\n\n1739\n01:31:51,270 --> 01:31:51,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n1740\n01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:54,990\n>> The whole meat of it,\nand what the tabs are, and\n\n1741\n01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:57,350\nwhere everything is at will be later.\n\n1742\n01:31:57,350 --> 01:32:01,348\n>> Yeah, definitely, we'll have a show\nthat defines setting up the whole entire\n\n1743\n01:32:01,348 --> 01:32:03,240\nplatform from beginning to end.\n\n1744\n01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:06,200\nRight now what we're doing is just showing\nyou how to deploy the applications.\n\n1745\n01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:10,830\nKeep in mind, that here in 688, we're\ngonna show you more about managing and\n\n1746\n01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:13,350\nmaintaining your\nWindows Intune environment.\n\n1747\n01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:16,510\nBut right now what we're doing is just\nfocused on the current objective, and\n\n1748\n01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:19,985\nthat's deploying applications out\nthrough using the Intune center.\n\n1749\n01:32:19,985 --> 01:32:24,680\n>> Mm-hm, all right,\nonce this guy loads up here.\n\n1750\n01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:30,057\nAll right, there we go, it loads up\ninto our System Overview view here.\n\n1751\n01:32:30,057 --> 01:32:30,615\n>> There we go.\n\n1752\n01:32:30,615 --> 01:32:32,687\n>> And we have a software tab.\n\n1753\n01:32:32,687 --> 01:32:34,852\nSoftware tab, we'll click on this guy.\n\n1754\n01:32:36,954 --> 01:32:39,440\nAnd there we go,\nour software overview and really neat.\n\n1755\n01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,353\nSo, Intune,\n\n1756\n01:32:40,353 --> 01:32:45,635\nit does require an agent installed on\nthe computer that you're hoping to manage.\n\n1757\n01:32:45,635 --> 01:32:46,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1758\n01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,273\n>> And I like this part, so\n\n1759\n01:32:49,273 --> 01:32:53,750\ndetected software, this is software that\nis already installed onto that machine.\n\n1760\n01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:58,030\nLet me see, so\nit's got the At V package on here.\n\n1761\n01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:03,011\nYeah, it needs stuff, so\nthere's all the crap.\n\n1762\n01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:05,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Managed software is where we're after\n\n1763\n01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:10,310\nwith this Intune stuff, and so there are a\nfew up here that I've already done before.\n\n1764\n01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:11,540\n>> Okay, and if we could real quick,\n\n1765\n01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:14,442\nlet's go back to that Overview tab,\nI wanna talk just a little bit about that.\n\n1766\n01:33:14,442 --> 01:33:15,496\n>> Yeah.\n>> You're gonna see a link\n\n1767\n01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:18,440\non the right-hand side there\nthat's called Add Software.\n\n1768\n01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:22,330\nNow this, like Nate said, we've already\npreloaded the software because it takes\n\n1769\n01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,040\na little bit to render, and\n\n1770\n01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:27,370\nyou wouldn't be able to see it during the\nepisode probably if we would wait for it.\n\n1771\n01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:33,760\nSo what he has done prior to this episode\nis click the add software link there,\n\n1772\n01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:38,510\nand what it does is it generates this\none-time instance on your computer there.\n\n1773\n01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:41,996\nAnd it's gonna start, it scans your\ncomputer for the prerequisites, and\n\n1774\n01:33:41,996 --> 01:33:44,982\nthen it opens up what's known\nas the Software Publisher there,\n\n1775\n01:33:44,982 --> 01:33:46,850\nIntune Software Publisher.\n\n1776\n01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:51,410\nAnd it allows you to browse\nto the location of the app,\n\n1777\n01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:55,240\nif you will, that it is that you want\nto publish up to the cloud here.\n\n1778\n01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:59,590\nWhen you do that,\nyou define some of the settings in here,\n\n1779\n01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:02,520\nyou define what the name's gonna look\nlike, and something known as the company\n\n1780\n01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:05,830\nportal, where your end users will\nconnect to to download this app.\n\n1781\n01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:09,830\nSo it is a process here that you have\nto go through, and there you go,\n\n1782\n01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:12,490\nNate showing you that process as we speak.\n\n1783\n01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:16,027\nSo keep in mind that when you\nwant to deploy an application,\n\n1784\n01:34:16,027 --> 01:34:19,660\nfirst you need to run this\nIntune Software Publisher.\n\n1785\n01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:22,522\nYou publish the application up to\nthe cloud like you see in here,\n\n1786\n01:34:22,522 --> 01:34:24,440\nNate'll show you here in the background.\n\n1787\n01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:27,480\nAlready got some apps preloaded and\nalready existing, but\n\n1788\n01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:31,475\nkeep in mind that you do have to run this\nprior to being able to deploy the apps.\n\n1789\n01:34:31,475 --> 01:34:35,612\n>> [NOISE]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1790\n01:34:35,612 --> 01:34:37,610\n>> That's cute, oh.\n\n1791\n01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:38,730\n>> Oh, there we go.\n\n1792\n01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:39,710\nThat makes a lot of sense.\n\n1793\n01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:41,684\n>> Yeah, that's perfect.\n\n1794\n01:34:41,684 --> 01:34:43,352\n>> We'll exit that.\n\n1795\n01:34:43,352 --> 01:34:48,370\nOh, I chose sevens,\nmaybe we already have it put on here.\n\n1796\n01:34:48,370 --> 01:34:49,760\nNo, I do not.\n\n1797\n01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,420\nLet's try to add that guy again.\n\n1798\n01:35:02,066 --> 01:35:06,623\nAnd if it takes a little bit of time from\nthe moment that you get this published up\n\n1799\n01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:07,463\nto the cloud.\n\n1800\n01:35:07,463 --> 01:35:10,376\nYou don't see it right away\nin your admin console,\n\n1801\n01:35:10,376 --> 01:35:15,008\nthe administrative console that's in\nthe background here, just give it a bit.\n\n1802\n01:35:15,008 --> 01:35:17,618\nLike I said,\nonce you publish it up to the cloud,\n\n1803\n01:35:17,618 --> 01:35:21,060\non their end there's a little bit\nof finalization that they have\n\n1804\n01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:24,520\nto do to make this available for\nyou in your admin console.\n\n1805\n01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:27,270\nWhich is that console that\nNate's got open right now,\n\n1806\n01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:30,215\nprovided it doesn't give\nyou this unsuspected error.\n\n1807\n01:35:30,215 --> 01:35:31,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1808\n01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:35,601\nAll right, well, it is a good thing for\nplanning ahead of time.\n\n1809\n01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:37,120\n>> [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n1810\n01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,970\n>> So, we have some apps right here.\n\n1811\n01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:44,050\nNow, let's click on\nthe Manage Deployment tab.\n\n1812\n01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:50,000\nIn Manage Deployment, we can choose\nwho gets what, more or less, right?\n\n1813\n01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:56,210\nFor this one, so we chose all users,\nnothing real big or important here.\n\n1814\n01:35:56,210 --> 01:36:00,880\nAnd this is for, which one did I have?\n\n1815\n01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,380\nSelect and well-\n>> We see them up there, yep.\n\n1816\n01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,170\n>> Great.\n\n1817\n01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:09,108\nAll right then, so available to install,\nso we can select whether we want\n\n1818\n01:36:09,108 --> 01:36:14,127\nto require the install, whether it's\navailable, to give them the choice\n\n1819\n01:36:14,127 --> 01:36:18,450\nto install it, or whether we want\nto uninstall it at the bottom.\n\n1820\n01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:20,066\nSo whether we want to revoke this app.\n\n1821\n01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:23,816\nIf we see it's creating problems, or\nbreaking other things, we can pull it.\n\n1822\n01:36:23,816 --> 01:36:27,363\nNow, hopefully everything is\ntested before deployment.\n\n1823\n01:36:27,363 --> 01:36:30,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, yeah, so there we go.\n\n1824\n01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:33,280\nThere's that right there.\n\n1825\n01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,302\nNow this guy right here,\nlet's click on Manage Deployment for\n\n1826\n01:36:36,302 --> 01:36:37,796\nthis one with the little red x.\n\n1827\n01:36:40,081 --> 01:36:45,090\nAnd this guy here, so\nI assigned this one to the computers.\n\n1828\n01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:49,880\nAnd deployment action\nis required to install.\n\n1829\n01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,800\nSo, they don't get a choice.\n\n1830\n01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:56,260\nThey have to install it, and\nlet's say we can set a deadline.\n\n1831\n01:36:56,260 --> 01:37:00,070\nIf for some reason it requires a reboot or\nsomething,\n\n1832\n01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:04,231\nwe can give them a deadline for\nwhen it has to be installed.\n\n1833\n01:37:04,231 --> 01:37:07,563\nSo say if one week,\nif one week goes by and\n\n1834\n01:37:07,563 --> 01:37:13,461\nthis app is not on that computer,\ncuz Intune detects what's on there.\n\n1835\n01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:17,013\nThen it will force the install,\nand we can go that route.\n\n1836\n01:37:17,013 --> 01:37:19,695\n>> Mm-hm, and\nwhen you publish software to computers,\n\n1837\n01:37:19,695 --> 01:37:22,740\nkeep in mind that you can't just\ndeploy them to any computer.\n\n1838\n01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:26,342\nLike Nate said at the beginning,\ntalking about Intune,\n\n1839\n01:37:26,342 --> 01:37:31,080\nyou do have to register or\nassign the device to a specific person.\n\n1840\n01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,340\nThen from that device,\n\n1841\n01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:36,390\nthey connect to the company portal,\nthey can get their user applications.\n\n1842\n01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:39,500\nBut once they assign the device,\nthen it becomes a managed device and\n\n1843\n01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,971\nNate can push this out to the computer,\nregardless of who signs in to the machine.\n\n1844\n01:37:42,971 --> 01:37:49,170\n>> All right, so we've got those guys on\nthere right now so that's the first part.\n\n1845\n01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:53,590\nSo we've got our applications up there,\nthey are published, everything looks good.\n\n1846\n01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:58,520\nAnd so, there's that agent that\nwe installed, the Intune agent.\n\n1847\n01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,910\nAnd it's down here on\nthis little toolbar here.\n\n1848\n01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:02,640\nWe'll click on this guy.\n\n1849\n01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:05,680\nWe'll go to the company portal, here.\n\n1850\n01:38:07,121 --> 01:38:10,579\n[LAUGH] All right,\n\n1851\n01:38:10,579 --> 01:38:15,200\nlet's try the center.\n\n1852\n01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:19,650\n>> [LAUGH] It looks like their\nwebsite's having some problems tonight.\n\n1853\n01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,430\n>> That's right,\nyou were having problems getting in too.\n\n1854\n01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:24,050\n>> I was too.\nI was having some severe lag issues\n\n1855\n01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:24,930\ntonight on it.\n\n1856\n01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:26,150\n>> All right, so get applications.\n\n1857\n01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,840\nOf course I think all it's gonna\ndo is just launch that guy again.\n\n1858\n01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:29,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n1859\n01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:31,570\nI think their website's\nhaving some issues.\n\n1860\n01:38:31,570 --> 01:38:32,677\n>> Let's try out though, client two.\n\n1861\n01:38:47,266 --> 01:38:48,411\nOh, is that not right, Wes?\n\n1862\n01:38:48,411 --> 01:38:49,160\n>> No, that's okay.\n\n1863\n01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,730\nYou sign into Intune up at the top there,\nsecond link.\n\n1864\n01:38:52,730 --> 01:38:53,880\nOver there, sign into Intune.\n\n1865\n01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,408\nNope, down.\n\n1866\n01:38:54,408 --> 01:38:55,534\nThere we go.\n\n1867\n01:38:55,534 --> 01:38:56,851\nThere we go.\n\n1868\n01:38:56,851 --> 01:38:58,240\n>> Thank you, Wes.\n\n1869\n01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:58,740\n>> Yep.\n\n1870\n01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:00,990\nThat's the website.\n\n1871\n01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:06,740\nWe'll see if it actually lets\nyou into the, Company portal.\n\n1872\n01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:25,360\nThere we go.\n>> All right.\n\n1873\n01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:26,830\nSweet.\n\n1874\n01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:27,540\nYep, so there we go.\n\n1875\n01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:31,430\nThis is the company's site and\nit does not,\n\n1876\n01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:34,160\nto browse to Install Apps you\nmust first select your device.\n\n1877\n01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:38,240\n>> This is where we talked about adding\nthat device before you can install\n\n1878\n01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:38,970\napplications.\n\n1879\n01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:43,170\nAnd even if they're published to\nthe computer or user, the device has to be\n\n1880\n01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:46,790\nregistered as a managed device inside\nof your Windows Intune account.\n\n1881\n01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:47,522\n[LAUGH] Very good.\n\n1882\n01:39:47,522 --> 01:39:48,155\n>> All right.\n\n1883\n01:39:48,155 --> 01:39:48,898\n>> There we go.\n\n1884\n01:39:48,898 --> 01:39:49,421\n>> Woo.\n>> Yes.\n\n1885\n01:39:49,421 --> 01:39:50,600\n>> So there we go.\nAll right,\n\n1886\n01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,230\nthese are the apps that\nare available to install.\n\n1887\n01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,310\nWe can click on this guy and install it.\n\n1888\n01:39:57,310 --> 01:39:58,860\nWe can pull it down.\n\n1889\n01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,065\nAnd, so there we go.\n\n1890\n01:40:00,065 --> 01:40:02,270\nInstall it down on our PCC.\n\n1891\n01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:05,616\n>> Now this is one of the things\nabout that cloud computing too.\n\n1892\n01:40:05,616 --> 01:40:07,450\nI mean if they're, generally,\n\n1893\n01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:12,520\nlike I said, the health of this website\nisn't really that bad, but you never know.\n\n1894\n01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,080\nOccasionally, if you've got\nInternet connectivity problem,\n\n1895\n01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:20,790\nnetwork connectivity problems, again, you\ncould potentially run into issues with it.\n\n1896\n01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:24,148\nBut for the most part,\nlike I said, the servers here,\n\n1897\n01:40:24,148 --> 01:40:28,674\nthe health of the servers, you can see\nthey provide a pretty good uptime.\n\n1898\n01:40:28,674 --> 01:40:32,784\n>> Yep,\nnow this guy is just gonna install, Wes.\n\n1899\n01:40:32,784 --> 01:40:38,320\nAnd this is deploying\nDesktop Apps using Window Intune.\n\n1900\n01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,067\n>> Yeah, it's funny that you picked\nthe same piece of software that I did to\n\n1901\n01:40:41,067 --> 01:40:41,663\ntest this out.\n\n1902\n01:40:41,663 --> 01:40:43,218\n>> Oh yeah?\n>> Notepad ++.\n\n1903\n01:40:43,218 --> 01:40:43,834\n>> Yeah?\n\n1904\n01:40:43,834 --> 01:40:45,244\n>> I seen that application in there.\n\n1905\n01:40:45,244 --> 01:40:47,956\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, great-\n>> We must think alike.\n\n1906\n01:40:47,956 --> 01:40:49,035\n>> Yeah, great little program.\n\n1907\n01:40:49,035 --> 01:40:50,680\n>> Yep.\n\n1908\n01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,330\n>> All right Wes, well, so there we go.\n\n1909\n01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:56,277\n>> Application coexistence, UE-V,\n\n1910\n01:40:56,277 --> 01:41:00,300\ndeploying desktop apps\nwith Windows Intune.\n\n1911\n01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:03,666\nWe've got RemoteApp,\nwhich is freaking cool, and\n\n1912\n01:41:03,666 --> 01:41:06,112\nAppView which is also really cool.\n\n1913\n01:41:06,112 --> 01:41:07,730\n>> Yep,\na lot of infrastructure behind it, but\n\n1914\n01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:10,910\nyou don't have to worry about a lot\nof the server side infrastructure.\n\n1915\n01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:15,110\nLike Nate said, be aware of\nthe components on the exam, and\n\n1916\n01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:17,190\nhow they work with one another.\n\n1917\n01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:20,484\n>> Yeah, and if something breaks to,\n\n1918\n01:41:20,484 --> 01:41:24,180\nI guess just to have an idea of\nwhere to trace back the problem.\n\n1919\n01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:26,440\nAnd yeah, just kinda go from there.\n\n1920\n01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,120\n>> Yes sir.\n\n1921\n01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,600\n>> Sweet.\nAll right, Wes, well,\n\n1922\n01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:32,260\nanything else to add on\napplication coexistence?\n\n1923\n01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:32,880\n>> No sir.\n\n1924\n01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,387\nI got nothing.\n\n1925\n01:41:33,387 --> 01:41:40,643\n>> Real quick, in the very beginning we\ntalked about using Hyper-V to coexistence.\n\n1926\n01:41:40,643 --> 01:41:45,100\nSo all these labs,\neverything was running off Hyper-V.\n\n1927\n01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:47,740\nSo all of our labs today\nwere all virtualized.\n\n1928\n01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:52,666\nAfter this show, I can just wipe\neverything out and we have used App-V and\n\n1929\n01:41:52,666 --> 01:41:54,500\nUE-V, all virtualized.\n\n1930\n01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,975\nSo there you go.\n>> All virtualization, and\n\n1931\n01:41:55,975 --> 01:41:57,742\nthen you completely roll back everything.\n\n1932\n01:41:57,742 --> 01:42:00,029\nAnd that's one of the good\nthings about virtualization,\n\n1933\n01:42:00,029 --> 01:42:01,770\nis that you can test bed the stuff.\n\n1934\n01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:04,920\nAnd don't hesitate to do the same thing\nout there in your environment too when\n\n1935\n01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,920\nyou're starting to\npractice this technology.\n\n1936\n01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:12,476\nNate mentioned the virtual labs\nthat are out there on TechNet.\n\n1937\n01:42:12,476 --> 01:42:15,576\nAgain there's a lot of different\nkinds of virtualization software, but\n\n1938\n01:42:15,576 --> 01:42:18,955\nthe one that's gonna be specific to this\nexam is definitely gonna be Hyper-V.\n\n1939\n01:42:18,955 --> 01:42:23,875\nSo definitely learn that\nspecific virtualization platform.\n\n1940\n01:42:23,875 --> 01:42:24,445\n>> Yep.\n\n1941\n01:42:24,445 --> 01:42:25,366\n>> And that's all I got.\n\n1942\n01:42:25,366 --> 01:42:26,110\n>> Nice.\n\n1943\n01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:28,330\nAll right.\n\n1944\n01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:31,470\nBe sure to check out our Q&A\nsection if you have any questions.\n\n1945\n01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:33,580\nWe monitor and answer to those.\n\n1946\n01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:38,420\nIf you have more immediate questions,\nwe do have the chat that's up here.\n\n1947\n01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:42,020\nWe monitor it,\nwe respond in the show here.\n\n1948\n01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:45,370\nAnd I guess that's it.\n\n1949\n01:42:45,370 --> 01:42:46,235\n>> Technology and stuff.\n\n1950\n01:42:46,235 --> 01:42:47,678\n>> Yeah, technology and stuff.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1951\n01:42:47,678 --> 01:42:49,360\n>> All right, well, signing off for\n\n1952\n01:42:49,360 -->

lined up.\n\n12\n00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,980\nWe got some Windows 8, 688 good stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,030\nAnd, you know, for\nthe official objectives.\n\n14\n00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,910\n>> What are we officially today?\n\n15\n00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:04,880\n>> We've got all right, so done, so\n>> We've got on 1.3,\n\n16\n00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,290\nand it is support Windows Store and\ncloud apps.\n\n17\n00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,050\n>> 3.1.\n\n18\n00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,830\n>> Yep, yeah, 1.3.1, through .5.\n\n19\n00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,130\n>> Nice, nice, nice.\n\n20\n00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,690\n>> So\nwe've got magic software through 365.\n\n21\n00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,143\n>> And we've got, you know, sideloading\nsome apps, and sideloading it to,\n\n22\n00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:26,380\nyou know, online images with Win Tune.\n\n23\n00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,840\nWith Windows InTune.\n\n24\n00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,500\n>> I like that.\n\n25\n00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,180\nWin Tune.\n\n26\n00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,550\nI think you're on to something man.\n\n27\n00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,420\n>> Me too.\n\n28\n00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,524\nAnd yep, you know,\n\n29\n00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:35,700\nfinish it off with a little bit\nof Microsoft account integration.\n\n30\n00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,100\n>> Very cool.\n>> And yeah, some great stuff lined up.\n\n31\n00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,760\n>> Very good.\n\n32\n00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,600\nAll right.\n\n33\n00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,530\n>> Well, I guess, yeah, I guess any,\nanything else to add before.\n\n34\n00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,940\n>> No not really, I think we're ready\nto jump right in to Office 365 and\n\n35\n00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,338\nthe complexities that has.\n\n36\n00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:51,709\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n37\n00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:55,660\n>> Now you guys might, remember in\nanother episode that we, Nate and\n\n38\n00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,450\nI tackled we, talked about syncraniza,\nsync, synchronizing,\n\n39\n00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,345\nsee here we go,uh,\nI don't think we can even talk.\n\n40\n00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:04,081\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, synchronizing, you know,\n\n41\n00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,840\nyour user experience across\ndifferent platforms.\n\n42\n00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,988\nWell, now what we're talking about is,\nhow do we deploy applications,\n\n43\n00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:15,585\nand control that via, for\ninstance, like the cloud.\n\n44\n00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:19,755\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit about\na cloud based service that you can use.\n\n45\n00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:22,595\nAnd it's gonna be required on the exam\nthat you know a little bit about this.\n\n46\n00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:25,175\nAnd this is called Office 365.\n\n47\n00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:30,832\nNow when you start Office 365, it is\nsubscription based, just like InTune.\n\n48\n00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:34,502\nAnd, really, when it comes to the\ninterface, interface is a lot like InTune.\n\n49\n00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:38,812\nIt's not, not identical, but, if you\nalready know a little bit about InTune,\n\n50\n00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:41,420\nyou're gonna be okay managing this app.\n\n51\n00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,460\nAnd you'll see right here guys.\n\n52\n00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,920\nI've went ahead and\nlogged into portal.microsoftonline.com.\n\n53\n00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,180\nAnd this takes us to our Office 365,\nand you can see our Admin Center.\n\n54\n00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,630\nNow, down the left side of the page,\nyou're gonna see just like Windows InTune,\n\n55\n00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,060\nyou navigate through the different\nnodes and you can see over here,\n\n56\n00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,880\nwe just Click the different setups.\n\n57\n00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,540\nAnd what I'd like to do,\nif we could, take a second here and\n\n58\n00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,480\njust talk about these different locations\nwithin the Office 365 Admin Center.\n\n59\n00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,410\nThis is the primary interface that\nyou're going to use to manage users,\n\n60\n00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,450\nsecurity groups, if you will.\n\n61\n00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,950\nDefine subscriptions and\nthe different license that\n\n62\n00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,260\nyour company obtains through Microsoft's\nsubscription based services.\n\n63\n00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,200\nAs well as determine what users or what\ngroups can utilize these different apps.\n\n64\n00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,540\nAnd what we're going to demonstrate today\nis the Office 365 Professional Plus.\n\n65\n00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,470\nThere's other one's out there like for\ninstance, Visia, Visio.\n\n66\n00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,260\nBoy, I just can't talk today.\n\n67\n00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,739\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Visio, [LAUGH] as well as Project Plus\n\n68\n00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,340\nthat you can also push out\nthrough this single console.\n\n69\n00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,450\nNow the first thing that we see here\nis what's known as the Dashboard.\n\n70\n00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,670\nAnd, if you look at the Dashboard you\nget a Service Health Overview and\n\n71\n00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,050\nnotice there's no service issues,\nthank goodness.\n\n72\n00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:05,000\nAnd we have the current\nhealth of our subscriptions.\n\n73\n00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,770\nNow you will also see that you get\ngeneralized information on your Dashboard.\n\n74\n00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,550\nFor instance, if I wanna download\nmy software which we're gonna talk\n\n75\n00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,750\nabout coming up here in a second.\n\n76\n00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,490\nI could do a lot of this\nright from this console,\n\n77\n00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,070\nand hey even give us\nthe ability to set up Yammer.\n\n78\n00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,810\n>> I was about to call it,\nI was like wow, Wes freaking Yammer.\n\n79\n00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,600\n>> We did.\nWe found another company that actually\n\n80\n00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,540\nactually uses Yammer.\n\n81\n00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,910\nWe can manage, again you'll see on\nthe right hand side here you'll see some\n\n82\n00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,290\nadministrative shortcuts that\ntake us to some common tasks.\n\n83\n00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,490\nBut let's go ahead and\nlet's get into the set up itself.\n\n84\n00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,050\nAgain, the Dashboard is much\nlike the Windows InTune Overview\n\n85\n00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,710\npage where it just gives\nyou a quick snapshot of\n\n86\n00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,580\nsome of the common places that\nyou might be interested in.\n\n87\n00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,340\nIf you just log in really quick and\n\n88\n00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,190\nwant a snapshot of the overall health\nof the service that you're utilizing.\n\n89\n00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,700\nNow, with the setup,\nwe've got a couple different options here.\n\n90\n00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,530\nWe've got the quick start,\nwe've got the extend your setup.\n\n91\n00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,068\nNow, quick start if I navigate into\nquick start it really allows me to\n\n92\n00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,840\ndo two things, it's very basic.\n\n93\n00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,703\nAnd it allows me to set up the users and\ngroups if you will, and\n\n94\n00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:13,370\nyou'll see assign the license to\nthe different users that I create here.\n\n95\n00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,490\nAnd then I can start using the service.\n\n96\n00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,820\nSo, this is why they call it basic,\nit's very basic set up here.\n\n97\n00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,350\nBut if you go out to TechNet and you read\nsome of the documentation behind this,\n\n98\n00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,700\nMicrosoft said that they,\nthey surveyed a lot of companies.\n\n99\n00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,680\nEven enterprise level\ncompanies where we're talking\n\n100\n00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,650\nmassive organizations that really\nhave a lot of end users to support.\n\n101\n00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,320\nThey mentioned that the majority of\nthem all wanted a basic setup, so\n\n102\n00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,500\nthat's why they put that in there.\n\n103\n00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,970\nAnd just said okay,\njust a simple point and click.\n\n104\n00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,140\nLet's go ahead and\nget a user using our services right away.\n\n105\n00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,130\nNow, the advanced setup uses,\na technology here and you'll see it.\n\n106\n00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,500\nIt talks about it right here,\nthe on-ramp for 365 we are going to\n\n107\n00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,800\nstay away from more complex setting\nup things like federation services.\n\n108\n00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,500\nThe guys will talk about that\ndefinitely more in the active directory\n\n109\n00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,640\nshows that we talk about.\n\n110\n00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,950\nSo we are just going to go\nwith the basic setup here.\n\n111\n00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,937\nNow, I wanna show you setting\nup end user accounts from\n\n112\n00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,680\nthe other options that we have here.\n\n113\n00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,170\nBecause when you see,\nif you do start this wizard, and\n\n114\n00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,310\nyou click Assign Users Roles,\nI could, or create the users.\n\n115\n00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,270\nI could add one user at a time but\n\n116\n00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,880\nI'd really like to show you\nthe other console to do this.\n\n117\n00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,290\nAgain, real simplistic point and\nclick wizard.\n\n118\n00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,130\nBut let's go to the user and\ngroups location here.\n\n119\n00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,100\nNow you can see that I as the,\n\n120\n00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,690\nyou know, global administrator\nI've got my account here.\n\n121\n00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,230\nI can't get rid of that unfortunately so,\n[LAUGH] I've got my account here.\n\n122\n00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,300\nNow, if I wanted to add an end user,\nI could do this real, real simple.\n\n123\n00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,200\nLike so we can add Mr Nathan here.\n\n124\n00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,020\nAnd Nate C and maybe his display\nname is just going to be Nate,\n\n125\n00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,080\nimagine how creative I am on that one.\n\n126\n00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,752\n>> No I like it.\n\n127\n00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,470\n>> All right and his username is going\nto be very simple just make it Nate.\n\n128\n00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,840\nAnd we're going to talk about\ndomains coming up here, but\n\n129\n00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,030\nif it is stored on Microsoft servers,\nnow in the cloud.\n\n130\n00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,470\nAll right, it's going to be the domain\nname that Microsoft ch, chooses here.\n\n131\n00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,508\nSo, for instance, I have NJOR3,\n\n132\n00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:22,890\nN-J-O-3 on Microsoft.com, so\nthat's gonna be our account name.\n\n133\n00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,280\nNow we could,\nlike we've seen in the InTune show,\n\n134\n00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,670\nwe can import our active\ndirectory infrastructure in here.\n\n135\n00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,910\nWe're not gonna do that at this point.\n\n136\n00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,050\nLet's go ahead and say Next.\n\n137\n00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,210\nNow at this point again what we can\ndo here is I can assign Nathan,\n\n138\n00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,180\nif I want, an administrative role.\n\n139\n00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,842\nI could make you a global administrator,\nand\n\n140\n00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,760\nthen you could manage services from here.\n\n141\n00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,550\nSo we're not gonna do that because I don't\nwanna give Nathan that kinda privilege.\n\n142\n00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,340\nBut we do have to select a location here.\n\n143\n00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,800\nAnd I'm gonna scroll down here.\n\n144\n00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,710\nAnd, where'd you say you were from?\n\n145\n00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,340\nKazakhstan?\n\n146\n00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,630\n>> I don't kn, U.S.\n>> The U.S. okay.\n\n147\n00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,130\nAnd then we're gonna say next.\n\n148\n00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,659\nNow you see the available license now,\nthis is the trial version so\n\n149\n00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,440\nit comes with 25 available licenses,\nyou can see the one license is,\n\n150\n00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,580\nwell for my user account so\nthat takes one off the top right away.\n\n151\n00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,370\nSo it's gonna tell you hey, you know,\nyou're gonna use of your license here.\n\n152\n00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,540\nAnd then it's gonna, I can send this email\nout, I can send an email out to myself or\n\n153\n00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,600\nI can send an email out to Nate and\nwe could give him his temporary password.\n\n154\n00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,410\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and create this and\nNate, did you wanna try to go ahead and\n\n155\n00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,595\nlog in to the system here?\n\n156\n00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n157\n00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,280\n>> Again you do have\na temporary password and\n\n158\n00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,180\nit's sent via email to\nthe email of your choice here.\n\n159\n00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,210\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ntell Nate the password here.\n\n160\n00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,525\nWell, actually,\nyou can see that right there.\n\n161\n00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:39,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Can you go ahead?\n\n162\n00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,390\nAnd he's gonna logon to the same\nwebsite that I used to login.\n\n163\n00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,176\nThe difference is an end user,\n\n164\n00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:49,050\nhe's going to not see the same\nthing that I'm going to see.\n\n165\n00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,210\nNope, and\ndid I go right on past that Nate?\n\n166\n00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,630\n>> Sorry about that, let me get\nthat temporary password back there.\n\n167\n00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:09,510\nDown to the results here.\n\n168\n00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:15,220\nAnd unfortunately,\nI did not save your password.\n\n169\n00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,199\nSo, what we're going to do real quick\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n170\n00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:24,510\nIs, let's back up here just one.\n\n171\n00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,560\nI actually did not save that password.\n\n172\n00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,280\nWe're gonna reset your password.\n\n173\n00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,250\n>> Alright.\n\n174\n00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:31,750\n>> All ready.\n\n175\n00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,630\nYou can't reset your own password.\n\n176\n00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,875\nOh wait a second here.\n\n177\n00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What are we doing?\n\n178\n00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,449\nYou can't reset your own password.\n\n179\n00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,590\nThat would be silly.\n\n180\n00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,400\nOkay, there we go.\n\n181\n00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,030\nI won't click on, right passed that.\n\n182\n00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,120\nOh, my goodness, can you see that?\n\n183\n00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,630\n>> Yeah,

quick.\n\n207\n00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,490\nI got to practice this a lot\nwith setting up these names.\n\n208\n00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,250\nSo display name is Nate.\n\n209\n00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,890\nIt requires a last name for\nthe administrator account, but\n\n210\n00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,310\nI don't think it does for\n\n211\n00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,355\nindividual users, but we'll put it there\nin case anyway, just to make it happy.\n\n212\n00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,521\nHit Next.\n\n213\n00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:20,881\nAll right.\n\n214\n00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:29,170\nHow

00:11:42,766\nAnd I can say finish.\n\n220\n00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:43,277\n>> Aw, crap.\n\n221\n00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:44,053\n>> That's okay.\n\n222\n00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,315\n>> What was the that old password?\n\n223\n00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:47,358\n>> Oh, oh goodness.\n\n224\n00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:54,080\n[LAUGH] [BLANK-AUDIO] I bet it,\n\n225\n00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,385\nprobably lost forever, huh?\n\n226\n00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,095\n>> That's probably lost,\nyeah, lost forever.\n\n227\n00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,190\n[LAUGH]\n>> Eh, well that's all, that's all good.\n\n228\n00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,361\nSo what, so after I,\nI do have a user account.\n\n229\n00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,783\nYeah, once you have your, your user\naccount logged in, what's gonna up,\n\n230\n00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:12,930\nyou're gonna see something\nkind of like this.\n\n231\n00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:20,050\nIf we can go back over to\nmy computer here, what he's\n\n232\n00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,620\ngonna end up seeing is he's gonna end up\nseeing the available software to download.\n\n233\n00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,130\nAll right?\n\n234\n00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,792\nNow, when he downloads this software, it\nutilizes a technology called Click-to-Run.\n\n235\n00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:34,120\nAnd Click-to-Run is a new streaming\ntechnology that might, well,\n\n236\n00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,952\nI say new, it was in Office 2010 as well,\nso 2010, 2013, has had it available.\n\n237\n00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:42,050\nNow Click-to-Run,\nyou're gonna remember in another ep,\n\n238\n00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,660\nepisode we talked about app v,\napplication virtualization.\n\n239\n00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,580\nAnd it's based on the same technology.\n\n240\n00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,730\nIt's kind of like a replacement for\nthe MSI, install package because when I\n\n241\n00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,010\ndownload Click-to-Run,\nclick to run starts downloading Office and\n\n242\n00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,410\nstarts to stream this application\nof the desktop virtually so\n\n243\n00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,950\nthat you can start\nutilizing it right away.\n\n244\n00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,630\nYou don't have to wait until the entirety\nof the application downloads.\n\n245\n00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,630\nNow, if you wanna use it for\noffline purposes,\n\n246\n00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,435\nyou do have to wait until\nthe entire application Downloads.\n\n247\n00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:14,485\nBut Click-to-Run, very simple product.\n\n248\n00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:17,915\nAll you have to do,\nyou can connect outbound to Microsoft and\n\n249\n00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:20,695\nthey can download directly\nto your computer.\n\n250\n00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:23,295\nOr if maybe you've got\non premise you know,\n\n251\n00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:26,735\nlocations that you don't want\nconnecting up, to Microsoft.\n\n252\n00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:29,675\nNot necessarily that you don't want\nthem connecting out to Microsoft, but\n\n253\n00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,360\nmore to the fact that you\nwant to customize, you know,\n\n254\n00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,580\nevery little component and\nwhat users can download.\n\n255\n00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,610\nWell, what you can do is you can go off\nto Microsoft and you can download to\n\n256\n00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,770\nthe Office deployment tool kit\nClick-to-Run as a stand-alone product, and\n\n257\n00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,032\nI've got, I'm, I've gone ahead and\ndone that Jason if we can switch over.\n\n258\n00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:54,340\nI wanna make sure I don't turn\noff my machine there [SOUND].\n\n259\n00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,042\nAnd you will see that the setup is\njust an EX, it's just a setup.EXE,\n\n260\n00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:03,504\nand it also downloads an XML file,\nand the XML file contains,\n\n261\n00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:08,790\nall the different elements, again,\njust to modify, your deployment.\n\n262\n00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,870\nAgain, you can specify which of these\napplications do you want to download?\n\n263\n00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,550\nWhat are the, you know,\n\n264\n00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,200\nwhat's the language package\nthat you want to download?\n\n265\n00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,400\nNow with the Click-to-Run technology\nin this virtualized process,\n\n266\n00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,070\nOffice suites can run side\nby side with each other.\n\n267\n00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,160\nNow there is one exception.\n\n268\n00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,524\nIf you have a 64-bit version\nof Office already installed,\n\n269\n00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:35,270\nthere's no coexistence between\nthe 32-bit and the 64-bit applications.\n\n270\n00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,430\nAnd they warn you about that.\n\n271\n00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:42,020\nThey say really research,\nstreaming out 64-bit applications,\n\n272\n00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,515\nbecause of You know,\nthe limited support for the add-ons.\n\n273\n00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,380\n32-bit, lot more support.\n\n274\n00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,740\nAnd it really should be the way you go.\n\n275\n00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,880\nAnd when it comes down to it,\n\n276\n00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,740\nlet's say that I have, Office 2010\nalready installed locally on machine.\n\n277\n00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,070\nI wanna test out the new product but\n\n278\n00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,770\nI'm not sure if I wanna deploy,\nOffice 2013 yet.\n\n279\n00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,040\nI'm not sure about the features.\n\n280\n00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,680\nWell, with this Click-to-Run and using of,\nOffice 365, you can start to stream\n\n281\n00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,230\nthe Office 2013 suite to your desktop and\nit can coexist in it's own isolated,\n\n282\n00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,020\nvirtualized session again basically a\ncoexistence between the older platform and\n\n283\n00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,700\nthe new platform allowing\nyou to test better.\n\n284\n00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n285\n00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,310\n>> Yep.\n>> Well yeah, yeah shoot.\n\n286\n00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,130\nThat's fantastic.\n\n287\n00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,030\n>> Yeah and the only other thing that\nthey might call out on the exam is\n\n288\n00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,436\nthe the other way that you can deploy and\nyou can control applications.\n\n289\n00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:34,482\nYou can also do this\nthrough Group Policy too.\n\n290\n00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:38,380\nYou just have to make sure that you go\nout and get the appropriate what is it?\n\n291\n00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,173\nAMXL files, and, or AEML files, and AEMX\nfiles, and they've got all the templates\n\n292\n00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,173\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n293\n00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:48,259\nThat you would need if you've got\nalready an existing active directory\n\n294\n00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:52,012\ninfrastructure so that you could manage\nit as well through group policy.\n\n295\n00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:52,711\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n296\n00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:53,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n297\n00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,910\n>> Yeah, shoot fantastic\n>> So, we're good.\n\n298\n00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,370\nI pushed 365.\n\n299\n00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,920\nYeah, incredible platform.\n\n300\n00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,090\n>> It really is.\n\n301\n00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,390\n>> I mean real amazing how far\nthings have come to, I mean,\n\n302\n00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,600\npush out this stuff you\nknow remotely to users.\n\n303\n00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,410\nJust makes stuff available and\njust to be able to administrate it.\n\n304\n00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,560\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n305\n00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,520\n>> And you also get things like\nservice health, that you can monitor.\n\n306\n00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,150\nThe quality of time of\nthe cloud based services.\n\n307\n00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,260\nYou got support, you can open\na support ticket with Microsoft if you\n\n308\n00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,030\ndo need support,\nyou could purchase additional services.\n\n309\n00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,160\nThey've got a message\n>> Center two that shows you some general\n\n310\n00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,800\nlevel alerts like we were looking\nat this before the episode stated.\n\n311\n00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,270\nThey even let you know that this\nyear what is it April 8th 2014\n\n312\n00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,390\nXP's lifecycle they pulled the plug so.\n\n313\n00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,900\nYou know, you get that kind of general\nlevel message, And then that also too,\n\n314\n00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,750\nyou you get some information on\nassisting you to maybe fix problems and\n\n315\n00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,055\nstuff that you might see within\nyour existing 365 architecture.\n\n316\n00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n317\n00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,940\n>> So.\n>> Yeah.\n\n318\n00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,000\nYeah, shoot.\n\n319\n00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,405\nNow now as far as installing and managing\nsoftware for the, the Windows Store.\n\n320\n00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:05,288\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n321\n00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:09,620\n>> You know it, there are ways\nthat we can manage the software.\n\n322\n00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,660\nYou know, of course,\nthe updates that updates itself,\n\n323\n00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,750\nwe can't control which updates\nthat it can and cannot take.\n\n324\n00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,530\nWe can control the stored altogether.\n\n325\n00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,710\nWe can just shut the whole thing down.\n\n326\n00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,860\n>> There is a policy to do that.\n\n327\n00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,680\nAnd you know,\nI can bring that up on my machine here.\n\n328\n00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,140\nIn to our local group policy editor.\n\n329\n00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,770\nAnd in here, in administrative templates\n\n330\n00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,520\nWindows components and\nthen clear down at the bottom.\n\n331\n00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,240\nStore.\n\n332\n00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,330\nAnd this guy right here.\n\n333\n00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,070\nSo, we can turn off the store\napplication all together.\n\n334\n00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,700\nWe can enable this policy and\nthen when a user tries to\n\n335\n00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,030\nclick on the store it'll pop up\na banner and it says you know.\n\n336\n00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,622\n>> This has been disabled,\nplease contact your administrator.\n\n337\n00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:03,810\n>> Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n338\n00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,950\n>> Now we can also restrict apps\na little bit different way, and\n\n339\n00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,330\nthat we can also do that by policy,\nand, and\n\n340\n00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,400\nWindows settings, and security settings.\n\n341\n00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,600\nApplication control policies.\n\n342\n00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,370\n>> Yes.\n\n343\n00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,040\n>> And good old app blocker.\n\n344\n00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,810\nWe can use app blocker to restrict those.\n\n345\n00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,360\nAnd the one down here,\nthe Packaged at rules.\n\n346\n00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,620\nAt swell net we are after no let I'll\njust write up a, a rule right quick.\n\n347\n00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,800\n>> Okay.\n>> So, just create a, a new rule.\n\n348\n00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,400\nWe won't go through the whole process\nof turning on the identity or anything.\n\n349\n00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,560\n>> Sure.\n>> I mean just click click through ad so\n\n350\n00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,800\n>> You know we have the option to select,\n\n351\n00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,770\nyou know, what we wanna do.\n\n352\n00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,650\nDo we want to allow an app or\nblock an app, or deny it?\n\n353\n00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,665\nAnd we want to deny to it.\n\n354\n00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or allow it to.\n\n355\n00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,170\nSo, we'll just accept the default,\nso for these purposes here, and\n\n356\n00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,150\nnow, we have to pick an installed app as,\nas a reference.\n\n357\n00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,620\nAnd what this will do is it will pull\ndown information out of that app\n\n358\n00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,185\n>> And uses like, a template more or less.\n\n359\n00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We can base the rest of this stuff on.\n\n360\n00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,910\nSo, let's click on Select and\nfor these, mm, how about Reader?\n\n361\n00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,340\nWe'll just pick that guy.\n\n362\n00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:21,417\nAll right so theres,\nthere's reader there and\n\n363\n00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:26,645\nthere's so then down here we've got\nthis little slider bar and this will\n\n364\n00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:31,415\nI guess set the amount of enforcement\nthat we want to allow or block an app.\n\n365\n00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:37,955\nSo on this one we are allowing it and so\nwe're gonna allow anything from, you know,\n\n366\n00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:42,350\nthe publisher Microsoft, anything with\nthe package name or Microsoft reader.\n\n367\n00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,960\nWith that version and\nso we can check this,\n\n368\n00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,690\nthe customized values and\nwe can slide it up one.\n\n369\n00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,540\nSo now, mm, well I guess not.\n\n370\n00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,888\nIt is grade out.\n\n371\n00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:01,442\nMm.\n>> That says so.\n\n372\n00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:06,200\nAll right, so, we're gonna have this,\nthis package version above or below.\n\n373\n00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,705\nPerhaps if there is a, a certain\nversion of, of the app that is broken.\n\n374\n00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:11,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Maybe, you know,\n\n375\n00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,390\nthey fixed it on some version app and\nso it'll be fixed from there on out.\n\n376\n00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,840\nWe can deny.\n\n377\n00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,020\nYou know, all the packages or\nthe apps that are below that version.\n\n378\n00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:27,830\nOr we can just allow that version and\nabove to go that route.\n\n379\n00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,200\nAnd you know, it is not, there we go.\n\n380\n00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,980\nAll right, so I had that thing clicked on.\n\n381\n00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,512\nAll right, so you slide this up.\n\n382\n00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:38,420\nAll right, and so now with this rule\nwe are going to allow anything from\n\n383\n00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,042\nthe publisher, Microsoft, and\nany app that is Microsoft.reader.\n\n384\n00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:47,270\nAll right, so regardless of version we can\nallow and of course, if our rule was deny,\n\n385\n00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,950\nblock it.\n\n386\n00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,470\nWe can slide it up one more and\n\n387\n00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,050\nnow with this rule it would be Anything\nby Microsoft that we would allow which,\n\n388\n00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,580\nI think is probably a good thing,\nyou know, and.\n\n389\n00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,380\nI think their,\ntheir apps work pretty well.\n\n390\n00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n391\n00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,160\n>> And as soon as you-\n>> I love XPS.\n\n392\n00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,850\n>> XPS?\n\n393\n00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,085\n>> XPS Viewer\n>> Oh, right.\n\n394\n00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:06,650\n[LAUGH].\n\n395\n00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,760\nSo click on through this.\n\n396\n00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,570\nWe can add any, any exceptions, if,\nif we have any, for these purposes.\n\n397\n00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,874\nWe do not.\nAll right, and then, a name for this rule.\n\n398\n00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:15,670\n[INAUDIBLE] Microsoft.\n\n399\n00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,940\nThat works for me.\n\n400\n00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,150\nAnd great.\n\n401\n00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,245\nSo we can set, a series of, of rules here.\n\n402\n00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:24,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To restrict what apps are allowed and\n\n403\n00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,760\nwhat apps are, are denied.\n\n404\n00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,835\nSo we're going to use this way to,\nto control those apps that way.\n\n405\n00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:30,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n406\n00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:37,440\nNow there is a way that we can\nkind of control what apps can run.\n\n407\n00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,490\nIn a way, I, I think it's related enough\nhere that you know, we'll call it out.\n\n408\n00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,500\nAnd it is called assigned access.\n\n409\n00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:51,200\nWhat assigned access will do is it\nwill limit a, a user's account.\n\n410\n00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,080\nTo access just one app, that's it.\n\n411\n00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,470\nSo you have no, no desktop, no nothing\nelse so, just, just one, one app.\n\n412\n00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,050\nNow to do that,\nlet me close out that right there.\n\n413\n00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,160\nHere we'll just minimize that.\n\n414\n00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:12,350\nAll right so, we've got so this machine\nhere and to configure assigned access to\n\n415\n00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:17,449\nlock this guy down in just one app,\nwe go into settings, change PC settings\n\n416\n00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,770\nOther accounts and\nset up account for assigned access,\n\n417\n00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,540\nclick on this now it says there you can\nchoose an account if you have access to\n\n418\n00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,980\nonly one Windows store app, now I think\nthat's kind of controlling software.\n\n419\n00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,760\n>> It is, yes it is.\n\n420\n00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,570\n>> All right,\n\n421\n00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:39,240\nto sign out of a assigned access we\ncan press Windows key five times.\n\n422\n00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,910\nSo we will choose an account and\nI've got one right here that will work,\n\n423\n00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,320\nand then choose an app\nthat is locked down too.\n\n424\n00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:55,270\nNow, mm, mm, mm, click on through.\n\n425\n00:23:01,028 --> 00:23:02,180\nThere we go.\n\n426\n00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,430\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n427\n00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,950\nThat's it.\n>> Very good.\n\n428\n00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,340\n>> It's all set up.\n\n429\n00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,710\nSo now, let's test this guy out.\n\n430\n00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,340\nWe will sign out of Mike's account.\n\n431\n00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,950\nHm, this guy, and, you know,\n\n432\n00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:41,710\nI'm not sure if I added\nthis guy to remote.\n\n433\n00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:48,241\nSee administrators group, I'm not sure he,\nnope I have to add this guy in there.\n\n434\n00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:55,990\nLet's get back into there.\n\n435\n00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,600\n>> Mm hm.\n\n436\n00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,160\nAnd while Nate does that, keep in mind\nthat if you only have the administrative\n\n437\n00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,320\naccount, assigned access is not\ngonna work cuz you don't usually\n\n438\n00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,330\nrestrict access to an administrator, so\n[COUGH] you have to make sure that you\n\n439\n00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,150\nhave the appropriate accounts\npreconfigured on the machine.\n\n440\n00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,530\nNow it does offer, this is kind of\na unique situation, I suppose, since,\n\n441\n00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,580\nI'm trying to remote into a machine on\nan account that I am trying to lock down.\n\n442\n00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,150\nSo, let,\nlet's see if this is going to work.\n\n443\n00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,850\nSo, let's just add this guy\nto the administrator's group.\n\n444\n00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,350\nOkay.\n\n445\n00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,470\nAll right.\n\n446\n00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,218\nThat would give him plenty of access.\n\n447\n00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:48,816\nSign back out.\n\n448\n00:25:05,894 --> 00:25:15,877\nHm.\n\n449\n00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:18,850\nI like simplistic usernames like Bill.\n\n450\n00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,566\n>> All right, perfect.\n\n451\n00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:27,600\nNow, everything goes well then it should,\nthere we go.\n\n452\n00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,629\nLock it down to the which\nwas already running.\n\n453\n00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,850\nAll right.\nSo, if I move my mouse over, you know,\n\n454\n00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,960\nto the, to the sides, I have no\ncharms bar, I have no, no corners,\n\n455\n00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,800\nno nothing, I can't, yeah,\nI cannot get out of here.\n\n456\n00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,670\nI push Windows key.\n\n457\n00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,950\nOf course, nothing happens.\n\n458\n00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,010\nAnd so, there, There we go, so.\n\n459\n00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,810\n>> I'm just saying you can\nlock my computer down anytime,\n\n460\n00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,030\nsorry, can't work all I can\ndo is play minesweeper.\n\n461\n00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,760\n>> Yeah.\n\n462\n00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,820\n>> So, very cool.\n\n463\n00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,520\n>> So, you know, perhaps depending\non things like a kiosk computer, or\n\n464\n00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,695\na demo computer.\n\n465\n00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:02,425\nYup.\n>> Perhaps you got a terminal set up\n\n466\n00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:04,420\nat like a trade show or something.\n\n467\n00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,105\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Where you want to run\n\n468\n00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:08,415\nprobably instead of Minesweeper\nit'd be like a company app.\n\n469\n00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:10,065\n>> Yup.\n>> Or something of that nature.\n\n470\n00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:12,975\nAnd you could lock that machine down\nusing assigned access to just that\n\n471\n00:26:12,975 --> 00:26:14,310\nWindows Store app.\n\n472\n00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,520\nAnd you know, put it up there and not have\nto worry about people going around and\n\n473\n00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,050\nmessing with it.\n\n474\n00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,240\n>> Sure, lock it down to like\na Powerpoint presentation so\n\n475\n00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,500\nall it's doing is advertising\nyour products and that's it.\n\n476\n00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,210\n>> Mm-hm. Mm.\n>> That's all that's gonna run on it.\n\n477\n00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,080\n>> Yup.\n>> Very cool, very cool.\n\n478\n00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,208\n>> And then to jump out of this guy,\nit was Windows Key 5 times, so [SOUND]\n\n479\n00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:39,584\n[LAUGH] All right,\nmaybe we'll slow it down a little bit.\n\n480\n00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,851\n>> And, access, denied.\n\n481\n00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,957\n>> Oh, what?\n\n482\n00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:47,420\nThat's what it didn't say,\nand sure enough.\n\n483\n00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,322\nAll right so it's still not working.\n\n484\n00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:52,514\nBetter luck next time.\n\n485\n00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:00,590\nYou know what, that is, that is funny.\n\n486\n00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,410\nIt, uh,it is not going to\nlet me out of this program.\n\n487\n00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,622\n>> Nope, looks like you're going\nto just have to disconnect.\n\n488\n00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:07,360\n>> Mm-hm..\n\n489\n00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,970\n>> At least you can keep track of your,\nyou know,\n\n490\n00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,710\nMinesweep, Minesweeper\nscore on that program.\n\n491\n00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,940\n>> Well, all right.\n\n492\n00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,670\nThere we go.\n\n493\n00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,446\n>> Yep.\n[LAUGH]\n\n494\n00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:16,924\n>> There's an assigned access.\n\n495\n00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:18,666\n>> And you can really restrict it, too!\n\n496\n00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:19,392\nMm-hm.\n\n497\n00:27:19,392 --> 00:27:21,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n498\n00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,230\nWe'll let let's see, so, the,\n\n499\n00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,145\nthe next thing that we have lined up is\nside loading, slide, side loading apps.\n\n500\n00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:30,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, side loading an app, a way\n\n501\n00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:35,335\nthat we can install a Windows Store app\nwithout going through the Windows Store.\n\n502\n00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:36,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n503\n00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,680\n>> There's you, you know, in a,\nI guess typical environment, you know,\n\n504\n00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,980\napps would be\n>> That would be signed by a developer and\n\n505\n00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,900\nyou know pushed out in the Windows\nstore and we could download it.\n\n506\n00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,960\nNow, some line of business apps that we\n\n507\n00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,980\nmay not want to put out in the Windows\nstore where they have to do the side load.\n\n508\n00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,420\nIt's a couple of commands and yeah,\n\n509\n00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,990\nwe can assault this guy without having\nto go through the windows store.\n\n510\n00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,820\n>> And that's really good too for\nlike for instance developers.\n\n511\n00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,670\nDevelopers who maybe want to test bed\ntheir software before its even released to\n\n512\n00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:11,940\nmanufacture, before its even RTM, we need\nto be able to get those on the machines\n\n513\n00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,990\nbut we can't go through the Windows store,\nbecause well,\n\n514\n00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,000\nwe haven't even digitally assigned it,\nwe're still in the development phase too.\n\n515\n00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,590\nSo, this gives you the ability to still\ndownload through the Windows store and\n\n516\n00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,160\ntest by that application.\n\n517\n00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,050\n>> Yeah, and you know,\nthis windows key, it just is not.\n\n518\n00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,210\nMan, having six.\n\n519\n00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,690\nAll right well we'll get to the old one.\n\n520\n00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,510\n>> Think we're right at our break, so we\ncan do that just as soon as we come back.\n\n521\n00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,520\n>> Yeah, that sounds good.\n\n522\n00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,030\nAll right some side load action.\n\n523\n00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,310\nWhen we come back, after the break.\n\n524\n00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:50,500\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back.\n\n525\n00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,505\nAll right so just before the break we\nleft off talking about side loading.\n\n526\n00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:58,520\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And that's a way that we can push out.\n\n527\n00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,240\nWindows modern UI style apps, you know,\nyeah, without having to go through the,\n\n528\n00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,320\nthe, windows store.\n\n529\n00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,790\n>> Yep.\nAnd all the publisher certificates and\n\n530\n00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,010\nthe licensing that you have to go\nthrough to get that, authenticated and\n\n531\n00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,200\ncertified in the Windows store.\n\n532\n00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,520\nIt takes a lot of time or\ncould take a lot of time and\n\n533\n00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,280\nwith software developers wanting to test\nthose applications immediately, as well.\n\n534\n00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,580\nThey might wanna push these out to systems\nto run the testing phase before they even\n\n535\n00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,210\nget to the certification or the publishing\ncertificates and stuff like that.\n\n536\n00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,430\nWith Microsoft to be able to,\nagain, Microsoft say okay we'll\n\n537\n00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,009\nput our stamp on them and\nwe'll put them up in a store for you.\n\n538\n00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:32,770\nMm-hm.\n\n539\n00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,510\nYup.\nNow for, for\n\n540\n00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,060\nthis demo\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n541\n00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,190\n>> I've used\nthe Microsoft Visual Studio 2013.\n\n542\n00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,330\nAnd just pulled up a basic template,\nhammered in a just\n\n543\n00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,770\na couple of some of the links with\na few pictures and and push it out.\n\n544\n00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,110\nSo we'll so\n\n545\n00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,900\nfor this one in the side load in tune\nstuff, we'll just use this little app.\n\n546\n00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,880\n>> Okay\n>> That that yeah, that we'll use.\n\n547\n00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,400\nNow the, the first thing to\ndo is to side load this guy.\n\n548\n00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,730\nIs we have to tell the machine\nto enable side loading.\n\n549\n00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,650\nNow these computers here\nare on a a domain which is\n\n550\n00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,200\none of the requirements\nto side load an app.\n\n551\n00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,700\nIt has to be part of a, of a domain.\n\n552\n00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,350\nIf it is not part of a domain,\n\n553\n00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:22,270\nthen you will need a Side load\nproduct key to push that one out.\n\n554\n00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:27,090\nSo, all right so we can slip over\nto our domain controller here.\n\n555\n00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,350\nSo let's open up group policy management.\n\n556\n00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,870\nAnd in here there is a policy here.\n\n557\n00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,760\nI wittily called it Decide to load.\n\n558\n00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,462\nAnd we'll edit this guy.\n\n559\n00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:45,690\nAnd the policy in here is in.\n\n560\n00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:51,500\nPolicies, administrative templates, and\n\n561\n00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:00,640\nWindows components and app package\ndeployment and that guy right there.\n\n562\n00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,390\nAllow all trusted apps to install,\nso we're going to push this out and\n\n563\n00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,980\nit says here, this policy setting allows\nto manage Installation of trusted line of\n\n564\n00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,200\nbusiness windows store apps.\n\n565\n00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,170\nPretty important.\n\n566\n00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,580\nSo we got that guy there,\nit is enabled and it is linked to\n\n567\n00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,960\nthe OU where we have our computers and\nour users and all that good stuff.\n\n568\n00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,510\n>> Okay.\n\n569\n00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,170\n>> All right.\n\n570\n00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,640\nThe second thing that we need to do\n\n571\n00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,390\nis we have to trust the certificate for\nthis app.\n\n572\n00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,250\nSo this app, since it's not\ntrusted by a well known authority.\n\n573\n00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,831\nI didn't go that route for\ndemo purposes here,\n\n574\n00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:43,596\nand for the certificate for it,\n\n575\n00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:48,353\n[SOUND] All right is that guy right there.\n\n576\n00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:50,513\nWe're gonna double click\non him yeah can't verify.\n\n577\n00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:56,453\n[SOUND] And now I did install this\none prior to the show Go ahead and\n\n578\n00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:58,257\nclick on install.\n\n579\n00:31:58,257 --> 00:32:03,778\nAnd yes, and we can, pick a place for\nit, and it has to go in the trusted\n\n580\n00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:08,717\nroute certification authorities,\nand click on next and finish.\n\n581\n00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:11,641\nFour was successful, cool, and on here,\n\n582\n00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:16,920\ncertification path down there at\nthe bottom, this certificate is okay.\n\n583\n00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,410\nSo, sweet.\n\n584\n00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,320\nSounds good, so\nknow that we trust this app, and\n\n585\n00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,540\nwe've told the computer that it is okay to\ninstall these apps [INAUDIBLE] All right.\n\n586\n00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,140\nSo, now, it gets to the point to where we\ncan start to really side-load this app.\n\n587\n00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,965\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> In there.\n\n588\n00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:31,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now,\n\n589\n00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,905\non this machine here,\nwe're into PowerShell.\n\n590\n00:32:34,905 --> 00:32:35,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And of course,\n\n591\n00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,375\nwe could use a, a command prompt, as well,\nsince we'll be using, DISM, right here.\n\n592\n00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But, to, you know,\n\n593\n00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,760\nto, remove this app, you know,\nwe'll use Power Shell to do that.\n\n594\n00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,160\nSo, so\nwe'll start off in powercell to do this.\n\n595\n00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,550\nAll right, so we'll put in dism, and\n\n596\n00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,720\nonline since that's the image\nthat we were working with.\n\n597\n00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,110\nThe current, running Windows, and then,\n\n598\n00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,960\nadd provisioned appx package.\n\n599\n00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,860\nAll right, now we need to\ntell it where the package is.\n\n600\n00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,720\nSo the package path.\n\n601\n00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n602\n00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,432\n>> All right and\nthat is on a network share.\n\n603\n00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:23,663\nFiles, web files, app three.\n\n604\n00:33:23,663 --> 00:33:27,840\nThree v two dot a ppx.\n\n605\n00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:32,620\nAll right and and\nWes you did mention the licensing thing?\n\n606\n00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,282\n>> Yes, definitely.\n\n607\n00:33:33,282 --> 00:33:37,116\n>> All right, and so, for for\nthis one we will choose to-\n\n608\n00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:40,071\n>> Skip license.\n\n609\n00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:43,830\n>> Okay.Very cool.\n\n610\n00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,350\n>> All right.\n\n611\n00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,395\nAnd we'll run that command, and\nit does take a minute to, to run here.\n\n612\n00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:49,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n613\n00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,720\n>> And yeah, so\nit's now gonna take this side\n\n614\n00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,130\nloaded app package\n>> And\n\n615\n00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,870\nit will push it into our addition of,\nor, addition.\n\n616\n00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,720\nAre, we'll just yeah, put it in there.\n\n617\n00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,450\n>> Yup.\nDefinitely.\n\n618\n00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,110\n>> All right.\n\n619\n00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,610\nSo, there we go.\n\n620\n00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,830\nIt completed successfully.\n\n621\n00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,420\nAnd let's go take a look at it.\n\n622\n00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:07,915\n>> And then there we go.\n\n623\n00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,275\nSo, there is app three.\n\n624\n00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:10,755\nWe'll fire this guy up.\n\n625\n00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:12,255\nWe'll make sure it runs.\n\n626\n00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:13,035\nAnd, there we go.\n>> Very good.\n\n627\n00:34:13,035 --> 00:34:14,245\n>> So everything works.\n\n628\n00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:16,685\nAnd we'll just try to click on a link.\n\n629\n00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:18,265\nAnd, yes, neat, all right.\n\n630\n00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,447\n>> Very cool.\n\n631\n00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:22,707\nSo there you go, it pushed out.\n\n632\n00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:27,807\nNow I don't have an image file\nhere to work for an offline.\n\n633\n00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:29,347\n>> Okay.\n>> But for the command,\n\n634\n00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:32,727\nif we wanted to push it\ninto an offline image.\n\n635\n00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:36,767\nOf course we could use\ndisamen to mount an image.\n\n636\n00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:44,023\nSo we'll just say mount image, image file.\n\n637\n00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:50,812\nAnd I will just say no server files,\n\n638\n00:34:50,812 --> 00:34:56,920\nyou know, in point one dot when.\n\n639\n00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,410\nSomething of that sort.\n\n640\n00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,220\n>> So you're pointing it to\nthe location of the image file that you\n\n641\n00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,270\nwant to connect to.\n\n642\n00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,250\nSo if we're gonna work on, we've got\nto find that image file to begin with.\n\n643\n00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,130\nGotcha, yup.\n\n644\n00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,330\nYup and\nthen we've got to give it a mount point.\n\n645\n00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:13,190\nSo let's say you know mount\ndirectory C colon slash mount.\n\n646\n00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,090\nAll right and you know, of course this,\nwhen file here does not exist right here,\n\n647\n00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,820\nso we're in that it does take\na little bit a while and\n\n648\n00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:26,040\nit will, it will mount that that\nno the image to a directory.\n\n649\n00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,730\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Once it's in the directory,\n\n650\n00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,570\nI will just backspace that out,\nwhat is in that directory and\n\n651\n00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:37,885\nthe command to do that will say image,\n\n652\n00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:42,950\nand where that image is, so it's in sequel\nslash mount door, whichever folder that\n\n653\n00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:47,717\nyou just mounted that image to\n>> All right, and\n\n654\n00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:53,804\nthen it will be add\nprovision apex package,\n\n655\n00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:59,889\nand then the package path and\nthen you know,\n\n656\n00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:05,190\nserver, share, you know\n>> App,\n\n657\n00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,640\nwe'll say app three dot appx,\nwherever it is.\n\n658\n00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,600\nAnd then, you know whichever else\nswitches you need to go along with that.\n\n659\n00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,650\nAnd that will then push it\nout into that offline file.\n\n660\n00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:24,800\nAnd of course after everything\nis all done, then it'll be\n\n661\n00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,860\nDism Image, then the path of\nwhatever image you are working with.\n\n662\n00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,540\nAnd hm, oh here,\n\n663\n00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,980\nlet's just backspace all that out.\n\n664\n00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,950\nUnmount c colon slash mount\n>> Then the path?\n\n665\n00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,910\n>> Yeah.\n>> Gotcha, yup.\n\n666\n00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,710\n>> And then for\n>> Unmount.\n\n667\n00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,990\n>> Syntax is everything on these.\n\n668\n00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,420\nYup, yup.\n\n669\n00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,130\n>> And then mount directory C:/ mount.\n\n670\n00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,860\nUnmount image, mount directory.\n\n671\n00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,710\nAnd then commit if you\nwant to commit changes and\n\n672\n00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:16,340\nsave as you unmount or if not then,\nyou know, it'd just be discard.\n\n673\n00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,790\n>> Gotcha.\n>> And there you go, and\n\n674\n00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:20,280\nwe're pushed out onto an offline image.\n\n675\n00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,560\n>> And that image would be ready for\n\n676\n00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,650\ndeployment after that,\nwe could just push that out.\n\n677\n00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,860\nThrough the machines that we\nwant to image the computer with.\n\n678\n00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,870\nAnd then that application will\nbe included with that image.\n\n679\n00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,102\nVery, very cool.\n\n680\n00:37:32,102 --> 00:37:33,340\n>> All right, now let's say for\n\n681\n00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,810\nsome reason we want to uninstall\nthis image and, and get rid of it.\n\n682\n00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:41,390\nNow the command to do that, now theres,\nit needs a, a package name.\n\n683\n00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,120\nAnd it's this really long\nstring of you know, just..\n\n684\n00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,250\nLetters and numbers to me.\n\n685\n00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,650\n>> West did they give us\nthe global unique identifier?\n\n686\n00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,300\n>> I'm not sure.\n\n687\n00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,050\nBut.\n\n688\n00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,710\n>> How they reference software.\n\n689\n00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,550\nThey can't make it easy.\n\n690\n00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,525\nThey can't make,\nthey can't just say, app three.\n\n691\n00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:57,240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n692\n00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,600\n>> It would be perfect for\nWest's typing abilities.\n\n693\n00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n694\n00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,190\n>> So to get that we will just,\n>> Get app x package, and\n\n695\n00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,220\nit will rattle off all of the packages\nthat we have installed on there,\n\n696\n00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,700\nand fortunately, mine here is listed\ndown there in the very bottom.\n\n697\n00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,770\nSo you can see, it doesn't have a neat\nlittle name like some of these others\n\n698\n00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,230\nPerhaps if I would have\ncompiled it differently.\n\n699\n00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,830\nI mean, I'm not an app developer,\nI just use a little template.\n\n700\n00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,640\nBut perhaps depending\non how I push it out,\n\n701\n00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,010\nI would get a much more friendly name for\nit.\n\n702\n00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,770\nThe one that we are after\nis package full name.\n\n703\n00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,560\nI must click that and\npress enter to copy it.\n\n704\n00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:46,380\nAnd down there at the bottom\nIt is remove a ppx package.\n\n705\n00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,910\nAnd then that package name.\n\n706\n00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:54,270\nSo click on here, and edit,\n\n707\n00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,770\nand paste.\n\n708\n00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,700\nThat should grant itself out,\nand remove that package.\n\n709\n00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,070\nAnd just do a double check\nto see that it is gone.\n\n710\n00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,180\nSure enough, and it's gone.\n\n711\n00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,020\n>> It's gone, look at that.\n\n712\n00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,080\n>> Out of our list.\n\n713\n00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,950\n>> Very good.\n\n714\n00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,440\nAll right, more of that electrical limbo.\n\n715\n00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,660\nVery good.\n\n716\n00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,030\n>> All right, so there we go.\n\n717\n00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,740\nPortion that guy out.\n\n718\n00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,720\nNow, there are other ways that\nwe can side load an app, and\n\n719\n00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,180\nwe can use Windows in\ntune to side load an app.\n\n720\n00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,360\nNow, the process is pretty similar to,\npublishing regular software.\n\n721\n00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,990\n>> Okay.\n\n722\n00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,730\n>> But, you know, we've,\nwe've got some time.\n\n723\n00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,450\nSo let's go ahead and\njump right in, into that.\n\n724\n00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,910\n>> Okay, sure.\n\n725\n00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,420\n>> All right.\n\n726\n00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,880\nSo, duh, duh, duh.\n\n727\n00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,920\nAll right, so\nwe'll get back into my machine here.\n\n728\n00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,900\nWe'll fire this up and\nlet's just into intune.\n\n729\n00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,320\nOnce this intune get fired up,\nwe will go to the software tab, and\n\n730\n00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,670\nI think we said it the last time\nas far as intune goes, we'll,\n\n731\n00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,295\nwe'll be covering it more in depth,\nnext, next time.\n\n732\n00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:02,030\nSo [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yes.\n\n733\n00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,050\n>> Not this time.\n\n734\n00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:03,740\n>> Definitely.\n\n735\n00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,030\n>> But further down, in the, series\nof subjects to cover, or objectives.\n\n736\n00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,690\nWe'll get to all the nitty gritty of it.\n\n737\n00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,370\n>> And\none of the good things about it too,\n\n738\n00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:16,060\nis that the interfaces you can see, we've\nlooked at the, admin console for 365, and\n\n739\n00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,740\nnow we're looking at Intune\n>> And\n\n740\n00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,320\nthey're really close to the same thing.\n\n741\n00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,960\nI mean,\nyou can see a lot of similarities in them.\n\n742\n00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,110\nOf course, there's different about you\ncan manage your security principles\n\n743\n00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,450\ninside too.\n\n744\n00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,600\nAnd again, manage things like your update,\nyou know, updates and stuff like that.\n\n745\n00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,160\nLike you said, we'll get, well get into\nthat, but the interfaces are fairly close.\n\n746\n00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,150\nWhich is good for the exam.\n\n747\n00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,550\n>> We'll start over hear\non the software tab.\n\n748\n00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,760\nWe'll click on this guy and it'll fire\nup and we'll choose to add software.\n\n749\n00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,890\nIt should load up this\nlittle plug in guy here, and\n\n750\n00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,659\nwe'll go ahead and get signed in.\n\n751\n00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,280\nAll right, we'll click next\nthrough this welcome screen.\n\n752\n00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,365\nThat is Don's favorite.\n\n753\n00:41:03,365 --> 00:41:04,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n754\n00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,430\nAnd so,\nwe will choose software installer, and\n\n755\n00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,480\ndown here we will choose\nthe Windows app package.\n\n756\n00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,399\nClick on this guy and\nwe'll browse to wherever the app is.\n\n757\n00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,630\nShould be in our network share and\nlab files at three.\n\n758\n00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,190\nAt three version two.\n\n759\n00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,480\nCan you believe there's a version two?\n\n760\n00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,420\nI've barely even worked on it and\nI already made a big revision to it.\n\n761\n00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,400\n>> Hey, very good, very good.\n\n762\n00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,115\nLike some other software\nthat I won't mention.\n\n763\n00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, for\n\n764\n00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,250\nour publisher we'll just\nsay we'll just say Nate.\n\n765\n00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,165\nWe'll accept the defaults on that,\nand category, Photos and Media.\n\n766\n00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n767\n00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,190\n>> In, in the, I don't have an image for\nit, but that would be convenient to put it\n\n768\n00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,360\nin there at this time\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n769\n00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,620\nClick on next, and\nour great little summary screen here,\n\n770\n00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,780\nand we'll click on upload.\n\n771\n00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:57,080\nIt'll take that package file and\nsplit it up in to.\n\n772\n00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,590\nUnfortunately, this app is very small, so\n\n773\n00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,760\nthis process shouldn't take a lot\nof time to stick it up there.\n\n774\n00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,440\nOnce it's up there, you know,\nwe have to go in there and\n\n775\n00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,055\nassign it to a person or\na group and deploy this guy.\n\n776\n00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:19,591\nAs it kinda just dulls\n\n777\n00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:24,235\nout right there.\n\n778\n00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:31,641\n[NOISE] All right, so there we go.\n\n779\n00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:35,203\nThe file uploaded,\nwe'll just close this guy right here,\n\n780\n00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:37,705\njust click over on the managed software.\n\n781\n00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:39,192\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n782\n00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:48,134\nAll right so there's our app version\nthree or version two, all right.\n\n783\n00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:52,512\nAnd let's manage the deployment for this\nguy, all right and you know in fourth, for\n\n784\n00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:55,961\nthis one is into and it is a,\na trial of count I didn't go through a,\n\n785\n00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:57,260\na lot of lengths\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n786\n00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,190\n>> In setting this stuff up.\n\n787\n00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,500\nSo, ungrouped users will\nsign up to that guy.\n\n788\n00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,510\n>> Yep.\n>> And all right, so\n\n789\n00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:09,100\nnow our deployment action and we will\nmark available for install, and finish.\n\n790\n00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,370\nAnd so there we go.\n\n791\n00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,990\nSo, there is our app Down there\nat the bottom, it is marked for\n\n792\n00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:19,500\ndeployment and we should be good.\n\n793\n00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,520\n>> So, the process is really and you guys\nare going to see as we discuss more about\n\n794\n00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,030\nin tune the process, other than you\ncreating the app yourself rather than.\n\n795\n00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,800\nAlready having this existing application\nlike, I don't know, notepad.\n\n796\n00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,570\nNotepad plus plus or something like\nyou see some of them in there.\n\n797\n00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,940\nYou publish the app.\n\n798\n00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,740\nOr, if you will, you create the app and\n\n799\n00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,610\nyou upload it no different than any other\nsoftware that you're going to distr.\n\n800\n00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,575\nDistribute through into.\n\n801\n00:43:44,575 --> 00:43:45,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n802\n00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:45,850\n>> Very cool.\n\n803\n00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,510\n>> Yeah, all right,\nnow as far as installing this guy,\n\n804\n00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,980\nall right now for this Windows package,\nnow, you know, we did talk about the,\n\n805\n00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,575\nthe company portal, I believe last time.\n\n806\n00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:55,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n807\n00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,560\n>> All right, so this one we can't\ngo through that company portal, but\n\n808\n00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,440\nwe'll have to use the\n>> Wind,\n\n809\n00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,420\nWindows modern UI style\ncompany portal app.\n\n810\n00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,960\nWhich I do have installed on here.\n\n811\n00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,920\nAnd we'll just click over here,\nand yes, I did tag it there.\n\n812\n00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:21,185\nAll right, so we will go the long way.\n\n813\n00:44:21,185 --> 00:44:31,185\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n814\n00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,190\n>> It's on to this guy.\n\n815\n00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:35,600\nYeah, you know,\nthe joys of doing everything remotely.\n\n816\n00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know and-\n\n817\n00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,290\n>> And trying to cast this stuff.\n\n818\n00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,380\nAnd not mess up our streaming software.\n\n819\n00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,350\n>> Yep.\n\n820\n00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,880\n>> All right.\nAnd so we are back in there.\n\n821\n00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,100\nClick on our terminal porter\nwhich now does launch.\n\n822\n00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,200\nAnd let's see if it has synced up yet\nor not.\n\n823\n00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,960\nWe'll click on new apps.\n\n824\n00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,128\nAnd with the, as long as it stalled\nout just uploading a 1 meg file.\n\n825\n00:44:56,128 --> 00:45:00,890\nOh, convenient.\n\n826\n00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,480\n>> And I have seen that before too,\nwhere it takes a bit for\n\n827\n00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,450\nsoftware to get up into the cloud and\nthen for a user to be able to connect\n\n828\n00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:12,840\nvia the cloud over online and then\n>> See that application in the background.\n\n829\n00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,800\nIt could take a few minutes there.\n\n830\n00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,400\nI've noticed this before when I publish\nan application up to the cloud through\n\n831\n00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,460\nthe intern service and then right after\nthat through demonstration purposes,\n\n832\n00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,560\nof course we try to log back in and\nsee that application.\n\n833\n00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,710\nAnd it could take a, it could take\na few minutes you know to get up there.\n\n834\n00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,020\nKeep in mind that you're probably\n>> Prestaging this type of environment\n\n835\n00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,650\nwhere, you know, the person's not\ngoing to need it immediately.\n\n836\n00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,720\nYeah.\n>> All right.\n\n837\n00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,380\nYeah, Jason,\nif you can cut away from this right quick,\n\n838\n00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,760\nI do have this link to other thing.\n\n839\n00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,830\nI paste in this password.\n\n840\n00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,160\nSo it did time out.\n\n841\n00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,908\nIt is one that I have not\n\n842\n00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:57,147\nmemorized.\n\n843\n00:45:57,147 --> 00:46:06,160\nAll right.\n\n844\n00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,650\nLet's turn and\nclick all the way back over to this guy.\n\n845\n00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,736\nAnd it did find some, some new apps.\n\n846\n00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:13,645\n>> There we go.\n>> And there we go so app 3V2.\n\n847\n00:46:13,645 -->

way away.\n\n852\n00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:36,170\n>> Hm.\n>> Yeah, you know, it yeah, a,\n\n853\n00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,560\na really sweet way you know of you know,\nside loading this stuff and\n\n854\n00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,830\nclick on that and get a little bit of\nStatus report on what's going down.\n\n855\n00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:47,805\n>> There we go.\n\n856\n00:46:47,805 -->

files,\n\n862\n00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,110\nthere we go, installing it.\n\n863\n00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,890\nIf you have a remote\nuser that is out there.\n\n864\n00:47:02,890 -->

00:47:16,700\nYou know, a line of business app.\n\n870\n00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:21,120\nAnd you know it's easiest to push out\nhere to Windows in-tune, hosted up there.\n\n871\n00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,052\nSee that's already installed, alright.\n\n872\n00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:27,202\nTo to push it out there for\nyou know for, for Sally and\n\n873\n00:47:27,202 --> 00:47:30,170\nthen she can get in there and,\nand download this guy.\n\n874\n00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,979\n>> And that's the good thing about,\nyou know using\n\n875\n00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:37,420\nthe in-tunes software there is because\nit's easier to manage on premise devices.\n\n876\n00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,573\nWe have a tendency to have more\ncontrol over a device that's\n\n877\n00:47:40,573 --> 00:47:41,897\nwithin our own network,\n\n878\n00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:46,090\nbut how do we push out that application\nwhen those devices leave our network?\n\n879\n00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,680\nAnd that's where\nthe InTune comes in handy,\n\n880\n00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,050\nbecause you can still\nhave Sally out there.\n\n881\n00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:54,250\nIf she's not within our network, and\nstill have access to that application, and\n\n882\n00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,365\nwe can push that out.\n\n883\n00:47:55,365 --> 00:47:57,840\n[INAUDIBLE] from within our network,\nor really just where ever you have\n\n884\n00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,042\naccess to a web browser, and manage that\ndevice, so it is definitely convenient.\n\n885\n00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:03,720\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n886\n00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,870\nAnd, yup, and I guess, one last thing,\n[INAUDIBLE] we'll just check and\n\n887\n00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:09,800\nmake sure this guy is\nindeed installed

there we go.\n\n896\n00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,130\nSide load stuff using dism or\n\n897\n00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,430\npowershell when you push that\nout the side load apps and\n\n898\n00:48:34,430

to my machine real quick.\n\n903\n00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,630\nOne thing I wanted to show you,\nbecause there is, you know,\n\n904\n00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,490\na certain portion of time\nwhere you've got a download.\n\n905\n00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:58,310\nThis is the click to run software\nthat we were talking about earlier.\n\n906\n00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,310\nAnd it had to set up the environment and\neverything,\n\n907\n00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,640\nit had to build up the environment so\nthat takes a little bit to demonstrate and\n\n908\n00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,050\ndidnt want you guys to have to sit\nhere and wait while it does that, but\n\n909\n00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:12,630\nit should be done,\nwell because it said it was done, right?\n\n910\n00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:15,080\nAnd we're going to go here and\nsee if we can find.\n\n911\n00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,590\n>> Well, maybe some applications that\nare directly related to the Office

ahead\n\n918\n00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,450\nand do the click to run installation for\nyou or again you can customize it.\n\n919\n00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:48,210\nTo suit your own needs, and\nyou just you know, it's a stand alone\n\n920\n00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,950\napplication that you download to\nthe office deployment tool kit.\n\n921\n00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:52,920\nIt's click to run.\n\n922\n00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,030\nIt also installs or downloads a sample\nconfiguration dot xml file and\n\n923\n00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:02,140\nin there if you know the appropriate\nsyntax you can modify it to\n\n924\n00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,490\ncustom your deployment to your needs.\n\n925\n00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:10,940\n>> All right ,we are coming up here\non break time we've got a couple\n\n926\n00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,850\nmore things to get to, we've got deep\nlinking apps through Windows intune\n\n927\n00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,390\n>> And kind of an odd one,\n\n928\n00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,030\nthey kind of threw in there,\nintegrating a Microsoft account.\n\n929\n00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,790\nI guess we're doing with\nWindows store apps,\n\n930\n00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,525\nI guess you have to have\nthat Microsoft account.\n\n931\n00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:25,540\n>> Sure.\n>> Tied in there.\n\n932\n00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,016\nSo yup, we've got those few things, that\nwe'll come right back to after the break.\n\n933\n00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:37,314\n[MUSIC]\n\n934\n00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:41,760\n>> All right, welcome back,\nwe've got a few more things to touch on,\n\n935\n00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,674\ndeep linking an app and wintune, and\nintegrating in a Microsoft account,\n\n936\n00:50:46,674 -->

so\n\n938\n00:50:54,657 --> 00:50:59,361\nit doesn't send you this verification\ncode every time you want to make\n\n939\n00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:03,452\nsensitive changes sensitive to\nyour account kind of stuff.\n\n940\n00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:05,630\nOkay, yeah.\n\n941\n00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,590\nSo to kick this thing off,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n942\n00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:12,260\nget into deep link, a windows store app.\n\n943\n00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,030\nNow deep linking,\nnow as you had a good way of explaining it\n\n944\n00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:20,680\nas a To I guess like present an app and\nhave it\n\n945\n00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,925\nactually linked over to a different\nplace to where you actually install it.\n\n946\n00:51:23,925 --> 00:51:24,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Something like that.\n\n947\n00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,715\n>> Yeah.\nThat's exactly it.\n\n948\n00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:28,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When we have a piece of software\n\n949\n00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,910\nthat we're gonna utilize this software.\n\n950\n00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:32,100\nWhere, to reference\nanother piece of software,\n\n951\n00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,640\nthat's where the process\nof deep linking comes in.\n\n952\n00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,890\nSo, I'm going to open one piece of\nsoftware, and I'm going to say,\n\n953\n00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,700\nyou know what, that's going to point\nyou to another piece of software.\n\n954\n00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,980\nAnd, your going to look\nat the settings and\n\n955\n00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,310\nthe configurations within\nthat piece of software.\n\n956\n00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,120\nAnd that's where deep linking comes in.\n\n957\n00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,898\n>> Huh.\n\n958\n00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:47,710\nNice, all right, and so for\n\n959\n00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:52,540\nthis we will use that same little\nWindows Ntune account that we're using.\n\n960\n00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,950\nAnd we can use my PC\nhere to do that stuff.\n\n961\n00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:03,520\nNow on here, the first thing we need\nto do is we need to get a URL path.\n\n962\n00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,400\nhttp slash whatever, path that we need.\n\n963\n00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,380\nSo let let's jump over\nto the Windows store and\n\n964\n00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,400\nlet's pick out let, let's pick out an app.\n\n965\n00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,222\nWe've done games plenty of times.\n\n966\n00:52:16,222 --> 00:52:17,111\nLifestyle.\n\n967\n00:52:17,111 -->

account on InTune,\n\n992\n00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,660\nthen I could link him to just this one.\n\n993\n00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,870\nSo he could see it.\n\n994\n00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,460\n>> Oh, very good, very good.\n\n995\n00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,530\n>> All right, there's so\nthe way that we can get to it,\n\n996\n00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:03,760\none easy way,\n>> To get this link

00:55:52,550\nThen we'll go down to our\nmanaged software, and\n\n1051\n00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:56,000\njust like all the other times\nwhere we've gotten in here.\n\n1052\n00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,710\nSo, there's our love quotes.\n\n1053\n00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,210\nRight there.\n\n1054\n00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,510\nWe'll highlight that guy.\n\n1055\n00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,375\nLet's manage it's deployment.\n\n1056\n00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1057\n00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:09,210\n>> And if we add Jason's in the young\ngroup, which would be ideal in this case.\n\n1058\n00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,910\nBut now let's do it to all the users.\n\n1059\n00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,979\nAnd we'll mark it for\navailable install and finish.\n\n1060\n00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,690\nAll right, there we go.\n\n1061\n00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,170\nSo, there is the bulk of it, now lets\ngo see if it appears in our Windows\n\n1062\n00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:29,610\ncompany portal, lets go back,\nnew apps and there it is.\n\n1063\n00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:33,030\nThere is the love quotes app,\nwe'll click on it now.\n\n1064\n00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:37,720\nThis time instead of the install option\nwe have view in the Windows Store,\n\n1065\n00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,750\nand we'll click on this and there we go.\n\n1066\n00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,120\nSo, there's our love app,\nright in there, and\n\n1067\n00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,030\nnow is the time where we can\nchoose where to install it.\n\n1068\n00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,030\nAll right.\n\n1069\n00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,720\nOne thing with this stuff.\n\n1070\n00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:56,276\nLet's go ahead and drag that window back\nout of the way, and let's go back here.\n\n1071\n00:56:56,276 --> 00:57:03,230\nSo, on our portal app, right,\nwe've got love quotes sitting right there.\n\n1072\n00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:07,990\nOne way where this could be useful in\na way that I see things, you know.\n\n1073\n00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,090\nI think corporate enterprise stuff,\n\n1074\n00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:14,530\nI'm not sure how all that\nwould push things out there.\n\n1075\n00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,060\nYou could in a sense.\n\n1076\n00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:19,050\nLike have suggested apps\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1077\n00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,060\n>> Four for your users.\n\n1078\n00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,730\n>> Yep.\n>> If if there is some pdf viewer or, or\n\n1079\n00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,790\nsomething else you want to\nhear employed as to to,\n\n1080\n00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:31,150\nto know about or to recommend you stick\nthese in, in here, and let's say,\n\n1081\n00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,840\nI mean you don't really own the, the apps\n>> That's right.\n\n1082\n00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,910\n>> You can't really side load it and,\nand push it out.\n\n1083\n00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,360\n>> Or you wanna go to the windows store.\n\n1084\n00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,310\nYou can have these apps in here as it's\nsuggestion, so, you know, a preferred app\n\n1085\n00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,610\nfor a your user so you don't have to\ngo digging through the Windows store.\n\n1086\n00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:50,950\n>> Yeah, if you could, go ahead and,\npull up the, the, the Windows store.\n\n1087\n00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:52,760\nCan you do that real quick on the machine?\n\n1088\n00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,170\nJust the basic Windows store there,\nand that's a really great point.\n\n1089\n00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,050\nWe'll go back to the main\nsearch page if we could.\n\n1090\n00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:04,970\nAll right, now if I'm a corporation just\nlike Nate said, maybe we've already got\n\n1091\n00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:09,630\nsome business apps, they're not a line of\nbusiness apps, there already in the store.\n\n1092\n00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:13,640\nWhat we want to do is simplify across\nthe entire environment the three\n\n1093\n00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,610\napps out of 300 that are in the store\nthat we really want to utilize.\n\n1094\n00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,420\nMaybe we have for instance admins.\n\n1095\n00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,020\nMaybe we come across the store\napp that's very good for\n\n1096\n00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:25,670\nchecking network connectivity, but\nit's buried somewhere down in this list.\n\n1097\n00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,160\nThe deep linking says,\n\n1098\n00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,130\nlet's take you right to the applications\nthat we kind of endorse.\n\n1099\n00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,885\nWhen I say endorse It's just\nwe've already pre-screened them.\n\n1100\n00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,785\nThey, and we wanna make them available and\n\n1101\n00:58:34,785 --> 00:58:38,125\nwe don't want somebody to have\nto search through the products.\n\n1102\n00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:40,125\nWhat category was that?\n\n1103\n00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,255\nOkay I got the category,\nwas it the right version?\n\n1104\n00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:43,725\nWhat was the name of\nthe software that you were?\n\n1105\n00:58:43,725 --> 00:58:44,655\n>> Hm.\n>> Oh, I don't have, no.\n\n1106\n00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:46,175\nWe don't have to worry about any of that.\n\n1107\n00:58:46,175 --> 00:58:50,115\nIt's right here in the list ready to go,\nand you can do this in Simplify.\n\n1108\n00:58:50,115 --> 00:58:54,810\nAgain, it's not so much the deployment as\nit is the downloading of that software.\n\n1109\n00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:57,120\nRight from the at store itself.\n\n1110\n00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,710\n>> Yeah.\n>> That was exactly what I was\n\n1111\n00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:59,440\nthinking about.\n\n1112\n00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,760\nSearching through 300 different apps in,\n\n1113\n00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,930\nin many different categories just\nto find that one that you want.\n\n1114\n00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:10,695\nAnd we, we've seen how sometimes,\nthe search engine, how well it works.\n\n1115\n00:59:10,695 --> 00:59:11,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1116\n00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,490\nYeah.\n\n1117\n00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:15,750\nAll right, Tim, anything else\nto add on deep, deep linking?\n\n1118\n00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,600\n>> No.\n>> Yeah?\n\n1119\n00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,950\nNot not a whole lot whole lot to it.\n\n1120\n00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:22,050\n>> No, it's pretty simplistic, and\nit didn't take too long either.\n\n1121\n00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:22,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know,\n\n1122\n00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,600\nespecially with those mobile devices, when\nit comes down to it, you want you want\n\n1123\n00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,160\na quick, way to get that, software without\nhaving to go through all those steps.\n\n1124\n00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,610\nAgain, you push that right out Be at the\npublisher, it's ready almost immediately.\n\n1125\n00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,500\nAnd then your mobile users\ncan get right to that,\n\n1126\n00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,350\napplication that maybe your team's\nalready prescreened, and, endorsed.\n\n1127\n00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,910\nLike I said endorsed, there's no,\njust saying that you guys like it and\n\n1128\n00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,310\nyou want to use it within your, home.\n\n1129\n00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,190\nOwned company.\n\n1130\n00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:49,040\n>> All right, well, so\nthat bring us now to our last little,\n\n1131\n00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,840\nsole objective here about\nintegrating a Microsoft account.\n\n1132\n00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,500\nNow, on this stuff right here, so this,\nyou know, this is a, domain computer,\n\n1133\n00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,250\na domain account we've been working with,\nand to get, a, the, Yet\n\n1134\n01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:06,200\nto use the Window's store,\nwhat's one of the requirements for\n\n1135\n01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,020\ndownloading stuff from the Window's store?\n\n1136\n01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,360\nWell, you need to have\na Microsoft account.\n\n1137\n01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,330\nSo, this whole time here I've.\n\n1138\n01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:19,015\nThe user here I have have,\nassociate it with my or\n\n1139\n01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,515\nintegrate it with my, domain account.\n\n1140\n01:00:21,515 --> 01:00:22,615\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> So there's the,\n\n1141\n01:00:22,615 --> 01:00:23,505\nmy domain account there,\n\n1142\n01:00:23,505 --> 01:00:25,485\nchick a bow slash Nathan\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1143\n01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:30,685\n>> And there is my, the, Microsoft\naccount that is linked right there.\n\n1144\n01:00:30,685 --> 01:00:33,525\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> I took pro do user at outlook dot com\n\n1145\n01:00:33,525 --> 01:00:36,615\nwhich will be a temporary account,\nI, don't email that guy,\n\n1146\n01:00:36,615 --> 01:00:38,385\nhe'll be deleted soon.\n\n1147\n01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:39,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n1148\n01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,190\n>> But all right, so the process of it, so\n\n1149\n01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:44,330\nwe'll just disconnect\nthis guy right there.\n\n1150\n01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:48,770\nAfter it unhooks itself, and there we go.\n\n1151\n01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,740\nSo, connect to a Microsoft account.\n\n1152\n01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,710\nso if we just you know,\nback up one, so there we go.\n\n1153\n01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,840\nWe get into our accounts,\n\n1154\n01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,550\nthere we go, connect to a Microsoft\naccount, click on this.\n\n1155\n01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:04,120\nThis will give us a, the choice to\nsync what it is that we want to sync.\n\n1156\n01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,765\nCourse, all these, options here,\nwe can change later.\n\n1157\n01:01:06,765 --> 01:01:07,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1158\n01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:10,350\n>> Just leave it on the defaults for now.\n\n1159\n01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,140\nAnd we'll click on next.\n\n1160\n01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,645\nAnd so now it's, who do you want\nto link it up, link it up to?\n\n1161\n01:01:15,645 --> 01:01:18,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we'll say.\n\n1162\n01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,780\nIT Pro TV dot user at Outlook dot com.\n\n1163\n01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,050\nAnd I did put this in the clipboard\nearlier while you were going on.\n\n1164\n01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:26,550\n>> Perfect.\n\n1165\n01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:33,560\n>> Click on Net IT Pro

go.\n\n1169\n01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,330\n>> So that is\n>> There we go.\n\n1170\n01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:47,010\n>> The all right, so, this screen\nright here this screen now I believe,\n\n1171\n01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,910\nWes, now you'll pick up at at this point.\n\n1172\n01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:50,450\n>> Yup.\n\n1173\n01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:54,665\n>> So, so right now,\nthis is not a trusted PC.\n\n1174\n01:01:54,665 --> 01:01:56,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, so it's, it's at,\n\n1175\n01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:58,120\nwell, I, guess for\nthe first time we're setting it up,\n\n1176\n01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,680\nit has to verify that it is\n>> Yep.\n\n1177\n01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,560\n>> You're, you're looking for.\n\n1178\n01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:06,470\nBut, if you make any changes to\nyour account, any password resets,\n\n1179\n01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:09,290\nadding billing information for\nthe Windows Store,

you've\n\n1182\n01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,480\npopped in there.\n\n1183\n01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,620\nSo I've got a phone number,\nyou can select that.\n\n1184\n01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,250\n>> Send yellow text message.\n\n1185\n01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,500\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1186\n01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,425\n>> Picks out a code, and you know punch\nit in and it will email you a code.\n\n1187\n01:02:27,425 --> 01:02:30,320\nMm-hm, at that point you can\nkey in that code and there's a,\n\n1188\n01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,490\nwell I don't give away all the,\nall the juicy details.\n\n1189\n01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:37,140\n>> So at this point,\nnow we've got an emails been sent out.\n\n1190\n01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:37,840\nRight?\nSo if we can\n\n1191\n01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,010\nswitch over to my\ncomputer here real quick.\n\n1192\n01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:43,110\nWhat we're gonna do back,\nsame location there that Nate was.\n\n1193\n01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,210\nWe're gonna go into the settings\nfrom the charms bar and\n\n1194\n01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:49,270\nthen you're gonna see we're gonna\ngo in to the change PC settings.\n\n1195\n01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:53,210\nNow at this point I'm gonna go over to\nthe, I did that a little quick there,\n\n1196\n01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,350\nthe Accounts location.\n\n1197\n01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:59,650\nAll right, now, I've already gone ahead\nand linked, if you will, this device.\n\n1198\n01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,710\nThis is a trusted PC and\nthe steps are gonna be no different.\n\n1199\n01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:07,900\nBut, they would have emailed the, whatever\nemail or text message like you said\n\n1200\n01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,050\nYou know, whatever is, you, you know,\nyour choice for getting this code, and,\n\n1201\n01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:22,000\nwhen you come in here,\nyou will get this same screen.\n\n1202\n01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,790\nRight?\nDialogue box,\n\n1203\n01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,510\njust a little bit different, right?\n\n1204\n01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,120\nBut, I've already got a code.\n\n1205\n01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,140\nI've already gone through this.\n\n1206\n01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:31,670\nSo, what it's going to look like when\nyou go to put your verification code in,\n\n1207\n01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,180\n>> Is it, it's gonna just say right,\n\n1208\n01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:34,380\nright here, you know.\n\n1209\n01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:35,210\nEnter your code.\n\n1210\n01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,221\nNow to make this a trusted PC,\n\n1211\n01:03:37,221 --> 01:03:41,886\nwhat you can do is you will put a check\nmark in this box right here Well,\n\n1212\n01:03:41,886 --> 01:03:45,920\nsince I frequently use this\ndevice don't ask me for a code.\n\n1213\n01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,162\nWhen you submit this,\nthis now becomes a trusted PC and\n\n1214\n01:03:49,162 --> 01:03:52,585\nyou don't have to worry about\nthat code coming up again.\n\n1215\n01:03:52,585 --> 01:03:54,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1216\n01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:59,190\nNow Wes, all right, yeah, to,\nto finish, well, actually no.\n\n1217\n01:03:59,190 --> 01:03:59,690\nYeah, that is it.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1218\n01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,538\nDid you wanna,\n\n1219\n01:04:00,538 --> 01:04:04,296\ndid you wanna show them assigning the,\nthe trusted PC real quick?\n\n1220\n01:04:04,296 --> 01:04:05,473\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n1221\n01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:10,040\n>> Yeah, I, you know, I,\nso while this is going on,\n\n1222\n01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,977\nI did key in on, on my machine here.\n\n1223\n01:04:12,977 --> 01:04:16,793\nAnd I did get a security code.\n\n1224\n01:04:16,793 --> 01:04:22,140\nLet's see [INAUDIBLE]\n>> And while Nate's typing that in.\n\n1225\n01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:26,670\nNathan was we were talking right before\nwe you know, turn the cameras on here.\n\n1226\n01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:30,920\nNathan said, keep in mind that every time,\nthis is, this is not a, you know,\n\n1227\n01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,050\na one size fits all code.\n\n1228\n01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:36,700\nIt's gonna be like a, you know, a one\ntime value and you will see a change.\n\n1229\n01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,550\nSo again,\nas you move from different devices,\n\n1230\n01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,910\nyou're not gonna get\nthe same code every time.\n\n1231\n01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,620\n>> All right,\nwe'll click on next to this stuff.\n\n1232\n01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,690\nAnd, and there we go, so\nwe can connect this guy.\n\n1233\n01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:50,485\nAnd that, I guess it'll give\nus the option at this point.\n\n1234\n01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:53,370\n>> Um-hm.\n>> To yeah, to do it,\n\n1235\n01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,510\nif we click over here.\n\n1236\n01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,260\nDut, dut, dut, ding.\n\n1237\n01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,310\nAnd that, yeah,\nit's teeny-tiny on that screen.\n\n1238\n01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:09,524\n>> Got the resolution like\n8,000 by 3,000 or something.\n\n1239\n01:05:09,524 --> 01:05:18,447\n>> All right.\n\n1240\n01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,218\n>> Then we'll go down\nto edit security info.\n\n1241\n01:05:20,218 --> 01:05:24,553\n>> Mm.\n\n1242\n01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:29,360\n>> Yeah, so\ndown there it's trusted devices, so\n\n1243\n01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:29,973\n>> Yeah, it went ahead and\n\n1244\n01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:30,684\nlinked it already for you.\n\n1245\n01:05:30,684 --> 01:05:31,499\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1246\n01:05:31,499 --> 01:05:33,864\n>> Very good, very good.\n>> Mm-hm, so sweet, there you go.\n\n1247\n01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:37,083\n>> And you notice the link there,\nyou can see that it's under there,\n\n1248\n01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:38,410\nit says trusted device.\n\n1249\n01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:42,510\nAnd then if you need to you can always\nclick and get additional information.\n\n1250\n01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,660\nI tell you what, the help topics,\n\n1251\n01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:48,350\nthey really are supportive when it comes\ndown to finding the information you need.\n\n1252\n01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:51,740\nEspecially when it comes\nto the exam purposes cuz\n\n1253\n01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,930\nsometimes they can give you\na general level overview.\n\n1254\n01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:56,860\nSometimes you can be connected out to\nsomething like TechNet and you can really\n\n1255\n01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:02,950\nget an in depth explanation and reads\nkinda like stereo instructions sometimes.\n\n1256\n01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:06,355\nSo maybe a little bit more than what you\nneed but definitely get you the support.\n\n1257\n01:06:06,355 --> 01:06:07,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1258\n01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,460\nAnd you know what, yeah, so\n\n1259\n01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,520\nthey settings to sink up with this guy\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1260\n01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,950\n>> Right, I guess, I guess we didn't quite\ngo in to show where those settings are and\n\n1261\n01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,170\nget to, is that right?\n\n1262\n01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:19,260\n>> Yeah, we can do that real quick.\n\n1263\n01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:23,420\nIf you will, you can,\nswitch over to my PC here.\n\n1264\n01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,350\nAnd again, let me show you where,\nwhere we're going with this guy.\n\n1265\n01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,320\nSo I am at the desktop here.\n\n1266\n01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,938\nAnd I am just going to\nbring up the charms menu.\n\n1267\n01:06:28,938 --> 01:06:30,662\nI'm going to go back to settings.\n\n1268\n01:06:30,662 --> 01:06:33,960\nGonna go to change PC settings.\n\n1269\n01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,270\nOh, wait a second, did I do that right?\n\n1270\n01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,900\nYour account.\n\n1271\n01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:38,400\nThere we go.\n\n1272\n01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,330\nBackup one?\n\n1273\n01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,538\nBackup one, went a little bit too far.\n\n1274\n01:06:43,538 --> 01:06:47,298\nAnd then Skydrive and\nhere comes your synchronization here.\n\n1275\n01:06:47,298 --> 01:06:51,209\nWhat we want specifically, let me double,\nlet me do this one more time again.\n\n1276\n01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:55,470\nSo again cuz step by steps\nare important on this exam.\n\n1277\n01:06:55,470 --> 01:07:02,720\nSo again, I'm gonna bring up the charms\nmenu, settings, PC settings, Skydrive.\n\n1278\n01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,260\nAnd then from here remember your\nstorage location for your files.\n\n1279\n01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,260\nBut we're looking for same settings here.\n\n1280\n01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,960\nThank you, Nate.\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1281\n01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,110\n>> And you will see different settings.\n\n1282\n01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:16,500\nYou'll see synchronize your\nsettings on this PC, and\n\n1283\n01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,330\nyou see the different aspects\nof what you can synchronize.\n\n1284\n01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:24,660\nThe Start screen, the General Appearance,\nDesktop Personalization.\n\n1285\n01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,500\nLook at this, list of apps that\nI've installed, very cool.\n\n1286\n01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The settings,\n\n1287\n01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:31,940\nand purchases within apps.\n\n1288\n01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:32,990\nI see some other settings here too.\n\n1289\n01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:37,280\nYour web browser passwords,\nlanguage preferences, ease of access.\n\n1290\n01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,989\nYou know, for\nhigh contrast in the narrator.\n\n1291\n01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:40,293\n[LAUGH] And then again,\n\n1292\n01:07:40,293 --> 01:07:44,283\nyou've got your other settings\nrelated to like File Explorer.\n\n1293\n01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:48,420\nKeep in mind that for Windows 8,\nit's no longer called Windows Explorer.\n\n1294\n01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:51,040\nWhat you guys know as\nWindows Explorer's pretty much still\n\n1295\n01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,050\nis Windows Explorer it's just\ncalled File Explorer today.\n\n1296\n01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:57,930\nYou can synchronize those settings\ntoo as well as your mouse,\n\n1297\n01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:59,134\ninput devices and printers.\n\n1298\n01:07:59,134 --> 01:08:01,136\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then Back-up settings.\n\n1299\n01:08:01,136 --> 01:08:03,539\nBack-up your settings for this PC.\n\n1300\n01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:07,259\nA, we're not talking,\nwe'll talk about recovery a little bit in,\n\n1301\n01:08:07,259 --> 01:08:08,887\nin, in another show here.\n\n1302\n01:08:08,887 --> 01:08:14,698\nBut if I want for recovery purposes I\ncan back the settings up to the cloud,\n\n1303\n01:08:14,698 --> 01:08:19,670\nwe can do a refresh, a reset,\nexcuse me, reset the PC.\n\n1304\n01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:23,270\nWipes all the settings away, wipes all\nthe applications if you will, reinstalls\n\n1305\n01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:27,580\nWindows, connect back up to the Skydrive\nand synchronize all these settings.\n\n1306\n01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,670\nRight back down to this.\n\n1307\n01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:31,670\nIn this case,\nthis laptop would be ready to go.\n\n1308\n01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:32,920\n>> Yeah, and you know,\n\n1309\n01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,765\nin, in, you've gotta keep in mind,\nif we were using UEV at this point.\n\n1310\n01:08:36,765 --> 01:08:37,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1311\n01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:41,690\n>> Linking the Microsoft account to\nyour domain account, it will wipe out\n\n1312\n01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:45,770\nthis option here to use your Microsoft\naccount to sync your settings.\n\n1313\n01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:49,320\nUEV, yeah, steps in and\ntakes all that stuff over.\n\n1314\n01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,320\nBut, I mean, which is fine,\nwe do the same thing just about.\n\n1315\n01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,180\n>> Yeah, maybe in a large enterprise\ndomain environment, UEV would be\n\n1316\n01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:00,130\nthe way to go, but if you dont, you're\nnot a part of an environment like that?\n\n1317\n01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:02,980\nWhat if you're part of a small\noffice/home office where\n\n1318\n01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,210\nmaybe you're part of a workgroup.\n\n1319\n01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:07,550\nWell this allows you the ability to have\na consistency across your desktop and\n\n1320\n01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:10,530\napplications as you move\nwithin that workgroup.\n\n1321\n01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:14,385\nOr have users, for that matter,\nmove within that workgroup.\n\n1322\n01:09:14,385 --> 01:09:15,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1323\n01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:20,230\nYeah, and you know,\nas far as the trusted PC, would,\n\n1324\n01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:24,760\nyou can trust just as many PC's\nas you frequently work with.\n\n1325\n01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,530\nYou know when you get that pop-up for\n\n1326\n01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:31,290\nthe code put in that check box that\nyou know you frequently login.\n\n1327\n01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:32,510\nRemember it.\n\n1328\n01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,870\nTrust this machine.\n\n1329\n01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:37,020\nSo the next time I try to edit\nany kinda sensitive information\n\n1330\n01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,680\nyou know don't send me a code.\n\n1331\n01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,388\nHey, you know, this is my machine.\n\n1332\n01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:41,433\n>> Yep.\n>> I'm good with it and yeah,\n\n1333\n01:09:41,433 --> 01:09:43,162\nyou can just trust those out.\n\n1334\n01:09:43,162 --> 01:09:45,000\nVery good.\n\n1335\n01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1336\n01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,620\n>> Well, Wes, I believe that we have\nexhausted our little topics for today.\n\n1337\n01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:50,330\n>> Yup.\n\n1338\n01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:53,510\nYeah, just keep in mind in some of\nthe technologies that you use within cloud\n\n1339\n01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,680\nbased services, you might see\nthat it takes a little bit for\n\n1340\n01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,980\nthe synchronization up to the cloud.\n\n1341\n01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:59,360\nFor the most part,\nit happens fairly quickly.\n\n1342\n01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,420\nBut if it doesn't happen, if you're in\na testing environment like this where you\n\n1343\n01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:05,608\nwanna see the results immediately,\njust give it a little bit.\n\n1344\n01:10:05,608 --> 01:10:08,832\nWe've talked about, off, you know,\noffset before where it's like,\n\n1345\n01:10:08,832 --> 01:10:10,820\nwhere are those settings, and you wait-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1346\n01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,025\n>> Just a few minutes longer and, well,\n\n1347\n01:10:12,025 --> 01:10:12,597\nthey're there.\n\n1348\n01:10:12,597 --> 01:10:13,302\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1349\n01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:16,639\n>> So if, if you don't see some of the,\ncloud-based services show up, like when\n\n1350\n01:10:16,639 --> 01:10:20,120\nyou're synchronizing things, right away,\njust give it a few seconds and reconnect.\n\n1351\n01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,810\nAnd they should be good to go,\nprovided the, you know,\n\n1352\n01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:26,600\nthe service health, mirrors.\n\n1353\n01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,470\nYou know, I was going to say mirrors\nwithout quality but, you know,\n\n1354\n01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:32,790\nwe have a general level of\nuptime with the service health.\n\n1355\n01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:37,530\n>> Yeah, you know, and yeah, good thinking\nwhen we were going through and we added\n\n1356\n01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:43,360\nthe software package to InTune and it did\nshow up in our company portal right away.\n\n1357\n01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1358\n01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:47,860\n>> You later on that night it did\nappear as I was going back through and\n\n1359\n01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,545\nyou know cleaning out some files and\nwhat not.\n\n1360\n01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:50,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1361\n01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,236\n>> It it was pretty nice the and\n\n1362\n01:10:52,236 --> 01:10:56,329\nthe app three the side loaded app\nshowed up right away and even the-.\n\n1363\n01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:58,290\n>> Mm-hm\n>> A are deeply encamped.\n\n1364\n01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,410\nI mean, it syncs right away\nwith our company portal.\n\n1365\n01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:01,910\n>> Yeah.\n>> That was that was pretty,\n\n1366\n01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,660\npretty convenient, huh?\n\n1367\n01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:06,966\n>> And for the most part, it's usually\nalways like that just check if,\n\n1368\n01:11:06,966 --> 01:11:10,937\nif you are managing accounts like\nthrough InTune or Office 365.\n\n1369\n01:11:10,937 --> 01:11:15,138\nBoth allow you the service health status\nthat it shows you some of the major\n\n1370\n01:11:15,138 --> 01:11:19,698\nservers and the major products that\nare online and if you have uptime.\n\n1371\n01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:22,054\nAnd if you see anything other than that,\n\n1372\n01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:27,340\nthat might be you know a reflection\nof why maybe an app isn't up there.\n\n1373\n01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,250\nBut pretty good availability.\n\n1374\n01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:29,755\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1375\n01:11:29,755 --> 01:11:31,170\nWell, sweet Wes.\n\n1376\n01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:33,843\nWell I think I am just about tapped for\neverything for\n\n1377\n01:11:33,843 --> 01:11:37,367\nour little objectives that we should\nbe concerned about at this time.\n\n1378\n01:11:37,367 --> 01:11:37,953\n>> Yeah.\n\n1379\n01:11:37,953 --> 01:11:41,690\n>> Do you have anything else\nto add before, before we cut?\n\n1380\n01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:42,470\n>> No sir.\n\n1381\n01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:42,970\n>> All right.\n\n1382\n01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,120\n>> Nothing.\n>> Well good deal.\n\n1383\n01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:49,270\nWell, be sure to check us out on\nitpro.tv if you have any

Hm-hm.\n\n1386\n01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,450\n>> We've got a Roku channel up there.\n\n1387\n01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:58,570\nOf course, there is no Q and\nA on the, on the Roku.\n\n1388\n01:11:58,570 --> 01:11:59,870\n>> Not on the Roku, guys.\n\n1389\n01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,140\n>> No, a little bit limited.\n\n1390\n01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:06,750\nAnd if you have any questions during\nthe show

00:00:36,652\nAlright, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:38,379\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:41,460\nI'm your host Don Pezet today with Mr.\nNate Copeland.\n\n7\n00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,740\n>> Yay.\nHey, Don how you How you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,200\n>> I'm doing just well,\nhow about yourself, Nate?\n\n9\n00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,130\n>> Yep, doing well, doing well today.\n\n10\n00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,150\n>> So we got another exciting\nepisode ahead of us.\n\n11\n00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,720\nWe are gonna be tackling Windows 8,\nparticularly the 70-688 exam.\n\n12\n00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,660\nAnd kinda diving into some of\nthe stuff that's involved there.\n\n13\n00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,600\nIn particular we're kinda getting\nback onto our security kick.\n\n14\n00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,340\nAll of these shows all of\nthese certifications today,\n\n15\n00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,040\nthey have these giant\nchunks of security in them.\n\n16\n00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,285\nCuz it's such a hot topic, right?\n\n17\n00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:08,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n18\n00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,300\n>> You can't crack open the tech news\nwithout finding this site got hacked,\n\n19\n00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,620\nthat data got compromised,\nthis got leaked.\n\n20\n00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,800\nWhatever, it's all over the place.\n\n21\n00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,800\n>> Yeah.\nSo, today on our show, right?\n\n22\n00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,040\nSo, we're covering objective 2.5,\nand it is manage,\n\n23\n00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,300\nshare, and NTFS permissions.\n\n24\n00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,260\nNow, it does cover configure EFS, although\nMike and I, we did EFS previously,\n\n25\n00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,280\nso we won't be discussing that\non this particular little bit.\n\n26\n00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,220\n>> Okay.\n>> We have configure security for\n\n27\n00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,670\nremovable devices.\n\n28\n00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,150\nJust locking those things down,\n\n29\n00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,760\nmake sure that we can control who\ndoes what with removable of media.\n\n30\n00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,160\nAnd lastly, configure BitLocker, or\nManage BitLocker and BitLocker To Go.\n\n31\n00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,970\n>> Yeah.\nRemember,\n\n32\n00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,960\nwhenever we get one of\nthese manage topics,\n\n33\n00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,840\nthat usually means that the configure side\nof it probably happened in the 7687 show.\n\n34\n00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,130\nSo if this is your first\ntime at bat on these and\n\n35\n00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,910\nyou haven't seen actually\nhow to implement something.\n\n36\n00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,940\nYou might need to jump over to\nthe episodes from the other show to\n\n37\n00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,510\ncheck those out.\n\n38\n00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,160\nYeah, now so on this first\nobjective it does mention manage,\n\n39\n00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,243\nshare, and NTFS permissions.\n\n40\n00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:25,320\nNow I think we'll get into those\npermissions pretty big in depth.\n\n41\n00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,390\nAnd they do kinda follow all the way\nthrough all the exams and everything.\n\n42\n00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:31,920\n>> Absolutely.\n\n43\n00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,960\n>> It's a big thing.\n\n44\n00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,840\n>> Yeah.\nIn the 7687 show,\n\n45\n00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,370\nwe hit permissions, right?\n\n46\n00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,030\nAnd we talked about taking a folder and\nsharing it out, and\n\n47\n00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,220\nsending some of the different permissions\nthat are on there, as far as like.\n\n48\n00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,000\nGiving somebody read access, or\nread and write, or whatever.\n\n49\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,640\nWhat we wanna in this show,\nis take a much deeper look.\n\n50\n00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,160\nBecause there are a lot\nof different permissions.\n\n51\n00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,030\nSome of which we didn't even\ntouch on in the other show.\n\n52\n00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,930\nBecause that was kind of the introduction.\n\n53\n00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,930\nNow we're moving up to the big leagues.\n\n54\n00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,690\nAnd so\nwe're going to take a look at those.\n\n55\n00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,430\nAnd we also need to spend a good\namount of time talking about\n\n56\n00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,605\nhow the permissions\ninteract with each other.\n\n57\n00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,530\nCuz that,\nit's a difficult concept to grasp and\n\n58\n00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,340\nit's different in different scenarios.\n\n59\n00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,410\nSo you kinda have to understand what's\ngoing on in your network, what different\n\n60\n00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,760\nelements are involved to actually figure\nout what permissions get applied.\n\n61\n00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,590\n>> Yeah, there are many ways\nto configure permissions to\n\n62\n00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,580\nmake sure that users have that\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n63\n00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,610\nAnd so, since there are.\n\n64\n00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,380\nSo many ways to restrict and grant access.\n\n65\n00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,130\nTroubleshooting can be kind of a pain\nif you're just clicking around\n\n66\n00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,643\nand shooting in the dark.\n\n67\n00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:39,143\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n68\n00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:41,910\n>>\n>> All right, so let's do it this way,\n\n69\n00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,545\nNate, cuz we didn't really\ntalk too much before the show\n\n70\n00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:47,245\n>> [LAUGH] We did talk about other non\n\n71\n00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:50,100\npermissions related things.\n\n72\n00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,620\nSo, let's start by kinda doing\nan overview of the different permissions\n\n73\n00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,220\nthat are available and\nkinda what they mean.\n\n74\n00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,950\nRight?\n\n75\n00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,110\nSo, we saw some of the basics, and let me.\n\n76\n00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,275\nI'll just kick it off with the easiest\none, cuz, that's, you know, easy for me.\n\n77\n00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,577\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'll leave [CROSSTALK] So,\n\n78\n00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:07,545\nlet's start with just read access.\n\n79\n00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:08,380\nAll right?\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n80\n00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,768\n>> If I give somebody read access.\n\n81\n00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:13,950\nRead access on a file versus read access\n\n82\n00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,270\non a folder is actually\na little bit different.\n\n83\n00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,620\nOkay, when I give somebody\nread access to a file,\n\n84\n00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,680\nthat's giving them permission to open\nup a file and see the contents of it.\n\n85\n00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,420\nSo if I have a text file and I give\nNate read access, he can open it and\n\n86\n00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,810\nread everything that's\ninside of that file, right.\n\n87\n00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,700\nFrank can't change it, can't save it,\nbut he can open it and look at it.\n\n88\n00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,300\nIf you give somebody\nread access on a folder.\n\n89\n00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,070\nThere is another name for that.\n\n90\n00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,510\nI don't know if we have it in here in our\nlist or not, but there is another name for\n\n91\n00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,500\nit which is called list folder contents.\n\n92\n00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,260\nAnd, when you read a folder you\nsee that the folder exists.\n\n93\n00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,738\nAnd you can see what\nfiles are inside of it.\n\n94\n00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:55,430\nNow you may not have\npermission on those files,\n\n95\n00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,190\nyou might not have permission\nto even read those files.\n\n96\n00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,380\nBut you can see that they're because\nyou have read access on the folder.\n\n97\n00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,180\nSo at the end of the day, it's the same\npermission but kind of a different action,\n\n98\n00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,020\nso read, as in read folder contents,\nlist folder contents.\n\n99\n00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,140\nAnd then read verses view\nthe contents of a file.\n\n100\n00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,430\nRight?\nSlightly different concepts.\n\n101\n00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,400\n>> Yeah, all right so,\n\n102\n00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,750\nthere's one, now you said\n>> You know, when you're talking about\n\n103\n00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,820\nread, someone they can't, yeah you\nhave read, you can get in there and\n\n104\n00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,452\nlook at the document but\nyou can't change anything in it.\n\n105\n00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:31,040\n>> Mm-hm\n>> .There is a special permission called\n\n106\n00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,940\nthe change permission.\n\n107\n00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,680\nNow it doesn't allow a user to\nchange the contents of that file.\n\n108\n00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,200\nBut what it does is that it allows\nthe user to change the permissions\n\n109\n00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,370\nof that file.\n\n110\n00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,740\nAnd so to change the contents of the file,\nlet's say if it is a, you know, a list of\n\n111\n00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,705\ngame shortcodes, for instance, then you\n>> User would need the modify permission,\n\n112\n00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:58,025\nor the right, to go in there and\n\n113\n00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:02,915\nwrite new codes and\nchange it that way, or modify.\n\n114\n00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:03,735\n>> Yeah.\nWhat I'm doing,\n\n115\n00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:05,360\njust real quick, cuz you know.\n\n116\n00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,420\nWe're gonna rattle off a lot\nof these on this show and so\n\n117\n00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,900\nit gets a little overwhelming.\n\n118\n00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,280\nAnd so what I'm doing is I'm\nwhipping up a little text file here.\n\n119\n00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,610\nSo I'm basically just gonna create\nnotes of each of these different ones.\n\n120\n00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,330\nAnd when the show gets posted\non the website I'll stick these\n\n121\n00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,150\nunderneath the show so you guys have them.\n\n122\n00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,840\nSo I mentioned read permissions\nof a file and for a folder.\n\n123\n00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,600\nNate was talking about change permissions,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,000\nAnd so\nchange will actually allow us to modify\n\n125\n00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,580\nthe permissions, of a file or folder.\n\n126\n00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,830\nNow, that sounds weird cuz a lot of people\nthey hear change and they think whoa that\n\n127\n00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,920\nmeans that I can change the file,\nI can change the contents.\n\n128\n00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,520\nRight?\n\n129\n00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,710\nBut it really doesn't.\n\n130\n00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,850\nThe permission that does\nthat is well write, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,310\nIf you have write permissions on a file\n\n132\n00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,610\nthat allows you to change-- oh I\ndon't want to use the word change\n\n133\n00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,780\nthere-- to modify the content of a file,\nright?\n\n134\n00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,320\nAnd if I have right\npermissions on a folder.\n\n135\n00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,300\nAllows you to create new\nfiles within the folder.\n\n136\n00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,010\nHaving write permission to the folder\ndoesn't necessarily affect the files that\n\n137\n00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,360\nare inside of it allows you to\ncreate new files with inside of it.\n\n138\n00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,300\nSo slightly different behavior\nwhether that permission is assigned to\n\n139\n00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,390\na file or a folder.\n\n140\n00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,770\nReal easy to confuse right\npermissions with changed permissions.\n\n141\n00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,280\nBecause those changed permissions\nare really tal- the changed-\n\n142\n00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,510\nit gets confusing, is it?\n\n143\n00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,560\nThe changed permission allows you to\nset permissions on the file and folder.\n\n144\n00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,274\nSo it is kinda Kind of strange.\n\n145\n00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:47,530\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Similar with the rights.\n\n146\n00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,170\nThere is a special permission.\n\n147\n00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,013\nIt's the right attributes.\n\n148\n00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:59,098\nThis allows a person to change\nthe attributes of a file,\n\n149\n00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,080\nsuch as an encrypted file.\n\n150\n00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,492\nRead only, hidden, archive.\n\n151\n00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:09,110\nRight, the archive bit for archiving.\n\n152\n00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,060\nThat is the Write Attributes.\n\n153\n00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,640\nWe also have\nthe Write Extended Attributes.\n\n154\n00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,360\nSo programs can write\nattributes to a file, and so\n\n155\n00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,160\nthose are the extended attributes.\n\n156\n00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:27,400\n>> All right, so\nif you're not familiar with attributes,\n\n157\n00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,580\nmost of us don't see these anymore\nbecause it's kind of an old school thing.\n\n158\n00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,232\nLet me just show you an example\nhere real quick on my machine, and\n\n159\n00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:38,150\nall right, so here I am on my machine, and\n\n160\n00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,330\nI'm just gonna pull up a directory\nlisting on my C drive.\n\n161\n00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,370\nAnd so here I am in the root of my drive.\n\n162\n00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,380\nAnd I've got my users folder, my windows\nfolder, Open-Sankore, I can see visual\n\n163\n00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,330\nC has done its nice little thing and\ndumped all its temporary files in my root.\n\n164\n00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,340\nYou know, Microsoft Visual C++, the run\ntime library does, let me delete all that\n\n165\n00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,650\njunk out of there, It's actually\nperfectly safe to delete this garbage.\n\n166\n00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,860\nAnd I shouldn't call it garbage.\n\n167\n00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,170\nIt's just that it's stuff that's\nleft over from the visual C\n\n168\n00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,000\nruntime environment installing it's stuff,\nand let me just save a little time.\n\n169\n00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,600\nThere we go.\n\n170\n00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,390\nOkay.\n\n171\n00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,380\nSo, some people are like, oh, crap.\n\n172\n00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,070\nYou just deleted all that\nstuff out of your root.\n\n173\n00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,030\nIt's all junk.\n\n174\n00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,210\nSo all right.\n\n175\n00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,860\nSo now I've pulled up a directory\nlisting here of my root.\n\n176\n00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,590\nAnd you can see I've\ngot a bunch of folders.\n\n177\n00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,660\nAnd see how it says 10 Directories,\n0 Files?\n\n178\n00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,490\nI got no files, all right?\n\n179\n00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,160\nWell, that's not true.\n\n180\n00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,880\nThere are actually files here,\nI just can't see them.\n\n181\n00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,430\nIf I do a dir/a.\n\n182\n00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,210\nThat says do a directory and\nshow all files.\n\n183\n00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,630\nAnd now, I can see there\nare actually five files in there.\n\n184\n00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,000\nThere's my swap file, pagefile,\na hibernation file, a boot manager,\n\n185\n00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,750\nright, so I've got several different\nfiles sitting in here that were hidden.\n\n186\n00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,110\nAnd they were hidden because\nthe hidden file attribute is set.\n\n187\n00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,630\nI'm gonna use the attrib command,\nor attribute command and\n\n188\n00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,430\nit'll show whether they\nhave certain things set.\n\n189\n00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,420\nNow the base attributes, the original\nones that Nate was talking about,\n\n190\n00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,840\nthe standard attributes.\n\n191\n00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,140\nThere's really four main ones,\n\n192\n00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,775\nthere's archive, system,\nhidden and read only, all right?\n\n193\n00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,615\nSo let me add those to the note.\n\n194\n00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:26,975\nSo, archive, hidden,\nread only and system, right?\n\n195\n00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:28,800\nAnd that's just saying if it's read only,\n\n196\n00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,190\nnobody's allowed to change\nthe contents of the file.\n\n197\n00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,540\nIf it's hidden, you can't see it.\n\n198\n00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,440\nIf it's archived, the next time we do\na backup, it needs to be backed up.\n\n199\n00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,010\nIt's been changed since\nthe last backup occurred.\n\n200\n00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,700\nAnd system, well, it's a system file,\ndon't mess with it.\n\n201\n00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,080\nAnd it will hide it and if you've\ngot hidden files turned on, right?\n\n202\n00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,590\nSo that's what those do.\n\n203\n00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,830\nBut there are extended attributes.\n\n204\n00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,640\nYou will see like this one has an I, which\noffhand, I can't remember what the I does.\n\n205\n00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,980\nBut there is a handful of other\nattributes that are special.\n\n206\n00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,800\nWe'll actually see some of them later on.\n\n207\n00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,750\nThere is a whole slew of really bizarre\nones that are very special use,\n\n208\n00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,590\ncertain case scenario type things that\nmost of us don't have to mess with.\n\n209\n00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,440\nBut it is separated out in the permission\nlist so you have write attributes for\n\n210\n00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,470\nhandling those basic ones and then\nyou've got write extended attributes for\n\n211\n00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,160\nthe ones that go beyond it.\n\n212\n00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,840\n>> All right, so Don,\nthese special permissions,\n\n213\n00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,820\nwe haven't quite shown where to look for\nthese special permissions.\n\n214\n00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,350\nAnd I can pull it up online so\n\n215\n00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,840\nyou make sure that we're\nnot leaving any things out.\n\n216\n00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,605\n>> Oh, sure, yeah if you wanna.\n\n217\n00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:34,295\n>> Yeah and I think, yep it's up there.\n\n218\n00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,905\nAll right, I have this folder up here.\n\n219\n00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:38,165\nThese game codes folders here.\n\n220\n00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:41,915\nAnd to get to these special permissions,\nthey are in the Security tab.\n\n221\n00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:42,975\n>> It's covered up by your head.\n\n222\n00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,995\n>> Oh, oops.\n\n223\n00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,040\nOf all the places it stuck that.\n\n224\n00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,452\nAll right.\n\n225\n00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:51,080\nOkay so yep, the properties,\nthe security, and the advanced.\n\n226\n00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,740\nAnd we'll just select a person here and\nchoose edit.\n\n227\n00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,480\nAnd here are the basic permissions\nwe've covered before and\n\n228\n00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,570\nshould be somewhat familiar with those.\n\n229\n00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,580\nIn this link here show\nadvanced permissions.\n\n230\n00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,580\nAnd these are the ones\nthat we are talking about.\n\n231\n00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,945\n>> Yeah so you can see where\nyou've got right attributes,\n\n232\n00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,090\nwrite extended attributes.\n\n233\n00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,220\nThey're right there,\nall the various permissions that we set.\n\n234\n00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,060\nAnd Nate pulled these up on a folder but\nthey're there on a file, too.\n\n235\n00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,840\nYou can set permissions on a file.\n\n236\n00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,890\nBut you'll see how some of them,\n\n237\n00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,480\nlike look at that second one there that\nsays traverse folder/execute file.\n\n238\n00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,200\nIt's the same permission but on a file\nthat means you're allowed to run it,\n\n239\n00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,180\nyou're allowed to run that program.\n\n240\n00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,280\nOn a folder, it means that you're\nable to browse through it and\n\n241\n00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,260\naccess content inside of it.\n\n242\n00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,010\nYou're basically allowed to\ndouble-click on it is what that means.\n\n243\n00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,580\nRight?\n\n244\n00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,390\nSo some of these permissions\nhave different roles based\n\n245\n00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,792\non whether you assign them to a file or\na folder.\n\n246\n00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,922\n>> Yeah and\nwith that traverse Folder execute file,\n\n247\n00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:54,120\nI believe that with the execute file\nit's more geared towards like scripts.\n\n248\n00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,050\nIf something were to go through folders,\nit could execute scripts and\n\n249\n00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,100\nyou know, PowerShell scripts and\nstuff like that.\n\n250\n00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,510\n>> I thought it applied\nto executables also.\n\n251\n00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,510\n>> Well, and executables.\n\n252\n00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,130\n>> So usually either way.\n\n253\n00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,800\nSo let's go back to our kind of\nlist that we were building up.\n\n254\n00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,990\nWe talked about read,\nwe talked about change.\n\n255\n00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,590\nWe talked about write.\n\n256\n00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,500\nOkay.\n\n257\n00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,410\nWhat's next on our list,\nlet me pull up our big list.\n\n258\n00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,490\nI guess we kind of jumped\naround a little bit.\n\n259\n00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,000\nWell, there's like read and change\npermissions, so you did change up here,\n\n260\n00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,210\nlet me add change permissions,\nthere we go, and\n\n261\n00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,610\nI'm going to add read to that so\nread permissions.\n\n262\n00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,950\nWhich is allows a user to view\nthe permissions on a file.\n\n263\n00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,025\nAnd that's an important one, if you just,\nyou might not have access to a file.\n\n264\n00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,975\nYou might not have access to a folder.\n\n265\n00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:52,015\nSo if you try to gain access to it and\nyou can't.\n\n266\n00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:53,635\nWell, how do you get access to it?\n\n267\n00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:55,955\nYou could try to find somebody\nelse who did have access.\n\n268\n00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:57,865\nIf you've permission to view or\n\n269\n00:13:57,865 --> 00:14:00,792\nread the permissions, you can pull\nup the properties of the file,\n\n270\n00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:04,322\nyou can go to the permissions tab and\nsee who has access.\n\n271\n00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:07,704\nAnd from there, you can find out who\nto go and ask permission from, right?\n\n272\n00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:12,175\nSo a useful thing, a lot of people\ndon't set this, but it is available.\n\n273\n00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:13,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n274\n00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,050\nAll right, adding to this list we\nhave the List folder and Read data.\n\n275\n00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,050\nList Folder, just like that, right?\n\n276\n00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,850\nIt allows a user to\nview the file names and\n\n277\n00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:32,610\nthe subfolder names of a folder,\nand read the data that is inside.\n\n278\n00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,910\n>> Let's list this\na slightly different way.\n\n279\n00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:40,890\nSo I listed read for\na file and read for a folder.\n\n280\n00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,090\nAnd that really ends up being\nthe same as list folders.\n\n281\n00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,670\nWe get different terminology,\nthis is where it gets confusing for\n\n282\n00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,910\nwhat you'll see on the exam.\n\n283\n00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,950\nThe terminology is changed\nover the years and stuff.\n\n284\n00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,000\nSo let's just let's try and list it\nkinda that way just for conciseness.\n\n285\n00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,140\nOh actually I don't want that.\n\n286\n00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,900\nWell maybe it's kind of a start.\n\n287\n00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,930\nSo when we look here, so I'm pulling\nthis up here on an individual folder.\n\n288\n00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,950\nAnd it's showing the permissions\nwith their very basic names, right,\n\n289\n00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,430\ntheir very simplified names.\n\n290\n00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,490\nFull control, modify, read and\n\n291\n00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,450\nexecute, list folder contents, read,\nwrite, and special permissions, right?\n\n292\n00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,100\nBut if I go into my Advanced screen,\nthat's where I really see the true stuff.\n\n293\n00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,730\nAnd so let me just take somebody here.\n\n294\n00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,890\nAnd now I'm getting a more\nsimplified screen than what you were\n\n295\n00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,360\nseeing a minute ago because I\nhaven't chosen show advanced, right?\n\n296\n00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,450\nSo these are the basic names.\n\n297\n00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,740\nAnd the instant we hit Show Advanced,\n\n298\n00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,850\nthat's when we get the really big stuff,\nright?\n\n299\n00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,920\nSo Nate was mentioning list folder.\n\n300\n00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,820\nRight and\nyou'll see how it's list folder/read data.\n\n301\n00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,960\nAnd so\nif I go back to my little notes here.\n\n302\n00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,740\nThat would be like here.\n\n303\n00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,950\nList folder.\n\n304\n00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,720\nRead data.\n\n305\n00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,250\nRight?\n\n306\n00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,629\nWhich is really read for\nthe file and the folder.\n\n307\n00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:04,246\nRight, so based on whether\nwe're doing basic permissions.\n\n308\n00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:06,162\nWhere we just have read.\n\n309\n00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:08,973\nWell, I guess they do list all\nof our folder content separate,\n\n310\n00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:11,370\nversus under Advanced where\nit kinda combines them.\n\n311\n00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,080\nSo it gets a little confusing,\nthe different verbiages on there.\n\n312\n00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,030\nSo let me do it this way.\n\n313\n00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,650\nLet me list this,\nI'm trying to think of a good way to\n\n314\n00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,420\nput this in note form that doesn't\nget too terribly confusing.\n\n315\n00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,500\nYou know what I'm going to do?\n\n316\n00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,910\nI'm going to nest these guys.\n\n317\n00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,170\nHow about that?\n\n318\n00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,150\nWe'll nest them under.\n\n319\n00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:35,770\nSo those are technically a subset\nof List Folder / Read Data.\n\n320\n00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,220\nSo under Read permissions\nyou'll see in here\n\n321\n00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,660\nRead permissions just\nstraight up by itself.\n\n322\n00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,020\nYou can either read the permissions or\nyou can't.\n\n323\n00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,180\nWhat was the other one?\n\n324\n00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,000\nRead extended attributes, same thing.\n\n325\n00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,950\nAnd Read regular attributes.\n\n326\n00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,670\nSo those three, you know, there just read.\n\n327\n00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,580\nDoesn't really matter.\n\n328\n00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,980\nDoesn't really get divided up.\n\n329\n00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,630\nAll right?\n\n330\n00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,670\nBut then Traverse Folder and\nExecute File, that does.\n\n331\n00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,600\nAnd so,\nwhy can I not switch between apps right.\n\n332\n00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,330\nSo let me add those in here.\n\n333\n00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,180\nThose are not really read or write so\n\n334\n00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:15,200\nwe got Traverse Folder / Execute File.\n\n335\n00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,700\nRight?\n\n336\n00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,380\n>> Yeah.\n\n337\n00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,210\nWe do have some of these\nspecial permissions that\n\n338\n00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,920\njust apply to the folders.\n\n339\n00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,740\nSo this Traverse Folder is one of them.\n\n340\n00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,780\nWe also have Create Folders and\nAppend Data.\n\n341\n00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,900\nAnd of course this one\njust applies to folders.\n\n342\n00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,560\nYou can create folders and append data, so\nyou can add data to existing documents.\n\n343\n00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,110\nBut you cannot change\nthe data that was existing.\n\n344\n00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,270\nYou can add to it, but\nyou can't change what was already there.\n\n345\n00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,000\n>> So those permissions fall\nunder some other names, right.\n\n346\n00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,750\nSo here I've got like how these\nare basically read permissions, right?\n\n347\n00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,010\nList Folder and Read Data really\nare just two types of read.\n\n348\n00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What you're describing, and it was,\n\n349\n00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,120\nwhat was it?\n\n350\n00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,360\nAdd?\n\n351\n00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,075\n>> Create Folders / Append Data.\n\n352\n00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,367\n[SOUND]\n>> If I can spell it.\n\n353\n00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:17,800\nThose are actually two\ndifferent versions of Modify.\n\n354\n00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,125\nYup.\n\n355\n00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:23,740\nSo, if I have Modify\npermissions on a file,\n\n356\n00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,390\nit doesn't allow me to create a file,\ndoesn't allow me to delete the file, but,\n\n357\n00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,760\nit allows me to modify\nthe contents of the file.\n\n358\n00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,330\nIt's like write permissions.\n\n359\n00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:33,870\nOkay?\n\n360\n00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,800\nNow I've already got up here write for\na file.\n\n361\n00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,330\nAllows you to modify\nthe content of a file.\n\n362\n00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,280\nFor Modify, I'm gonna come in and\nsay the same thing,\n\n363\n00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,870\nallows you to change\nthe contents of a file.\n\n364\n00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,650\nSo why would we have two different\npermissions that effectively do the same\n\n365\n00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,680\nthing, right?\n\n366\n00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,680\nAnd this is where we get into one\nof our challenges with permissions.\n\n367\n00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,860\nWhere we have NTFS permissions,\nand we have share permissions.\n\n368\n00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,965\nAnd they're different, right?\n\n369\n00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:05,240\n[LAUGH] So if you've already watched\nthe 7687 show, we kinda covered this.\n\n370\n00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,290\nBut you'll see variations.\n\n371\n00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,500\nThe property screen that I pulled up here,\nthose are NTFS permissions.\n\n372\n00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,390\nAnd so as I look in here, I've got Write,\nI've got Change permissions,\n\n373\n00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,010\nwe've got, well right here,\nactually write attributes.\n\n374\n00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,970\nWhere's the, let's see.\n\n375\n00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,831\nRead, create, delete.\n\n376\n00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,869\nOh, you know what, I pulled up a folder.\n\n377\n00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,840\nLet me pull up a file.\n\n378\n00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,857\nLet me get into the right screen here,\nso I can,\n\n379\n00:19:36,857 --> 00:19:39,736\nhere we'll pull up like [SOUND]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:42,169\n>> Yeah, didn't expect to go ten deep to\n\n381\n00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,920\nfind a file there, but\n>> Apparently I have to.\n\n382\n00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,630\nAlright so if I go in here,\nwell actually right back here.\n\n383\n00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,835\nSo here I've got like Full control and\nModify, right?\n\n384\n00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,910\nRead, rewrite and so on.\n\n385\n00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,320\nSo right here,\nI'm seeing things like Modify.\n\n386\n00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,710\nI'm not seeing Append Data, right?\n\n387\n00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:10,224\nAnd so when I go into Advanced >\nChange permissions > Modify somebody,\n\n388\n00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:14,672\noh these are in here\nlet me add in somebody.\n\n389\n00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:18,610\nEverything is fifty users deep today.\n\n390\n00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,716\nHere, I'll just add in the back up users.\n\n391\n00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:25,600\n>> There we go\n>> Alright, so,\n\n392\n00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,990\nso here you know I switched\nto Advanced view, right?\n\n393\n00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,420\nAnd so I've got,\nwe haven't talked about Full control.\n\n394\n00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,790\nFull control is just everything, right?\n\n395\n00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,590\nGive them the whole thing.\n\n396\n00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,140\nBut here we've got read and so on and\nsee how modify is not on the list anymore?\n\n397\n00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,270\nBut if I go back to Show Basic,\nthere's Modify.\n\n398\n00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,400\nAll right.\n\n399\n00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,410\nTwo different names for\nthe same permission.\n\n400\n00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,400\nModify is just combining the folder\nname and the file name, right?\n\n401\n00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,500\nSo I guess if I wanted to list\nthis a little more accurately,\n\n402\n00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,230\nif I went back here.\n\n403\n00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,890\nI can say that really, these are both Read\n\n404\n00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,250\nand with a file, its Read Data, but\n\n405\n00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:11,650\nwith a folder it is List Folder Contents.\n\n406\n00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,950\nSo that's really what those two are.\n\n407\n00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,460\nAnd in the basic view, we just see,\nI deleted the wrong thing.\n\n408\n00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,440\nWe just see Read in the Basic view.\n\n409\n00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,870\nBut in the Advanced view,\nwe actually see these breakdowns here, so\n\n410\n00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,710\nyou'll have, let's see where is,\n\n411\n00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,350\nwe've got Read permission,\nRead extension, Read attributes.\n\n412\n00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,190\nOh it's just List Folder / Read Data so\nit still kind of listed both there.\n\n413\n00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,030\nBut yeah so in the Basic view\nthose both fall under Read.\n\n414\n00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,580\nAnd then see here how we've got Read and\nExecute?\n\n415\n00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,570\nYou can't execute a file unless you can\nread it so they're kind of combined.\n\n416\n00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,399\nAnd so when you read and\n\n417\n00:21:54,399 --> 00:22:00,270\nexecute that it's giving you\nthe Traverse Folder / Execute File.\n\n418\n00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,600\nSo if I took these two, right here,\nTraverse Folder / Execute File.\n\n419\n00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,880\nThose really fall under\nthe Read & Execute name.\n\n420\n00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,570\nSo that's why we have these kind\nof duplications in the name.\n\n421\n00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,970\nSo let's, I'm going to change things here.\n\n422\n00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,320\nI'm just going to change\nthem in my notes here, so\n\n423\n00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120\nit kind of corresponds a little better,\nmakes it easier to understand.\n\n424\n00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,720\n>> Yeah, I guess much better than just\ndumping stuff all over the little\n\n425\n00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,050\nnote sheet here.\n\n426\n00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,620\nIt does get a little tricky because\nwith the basic permissions here,\n\n427\n00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,660\nwe covered the basic permissions.\n\n428\n00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,140\nBehind the scenes, those basic permissions\nare just setting these advanced, or\n\n429\n00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,270\nnot advanced, yeah, these advanced,\nthese special permissions.\n\n430\n00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,356\nAdvanced permissions,\n\n431\n00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:49,210\nthe more fine-grained set things for\nhowever you need to set them.\n\n432\n00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n433\n00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,560\nSo, when we take a look\nat something like Write.\n\n434\n00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,700\nI'm just gonna check off Write.\n\n435\n00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,120\nAnd when I go to show advanced\npermissions, see how Write has all of\n\n436\n00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,000\nthese other things checked off right, they\nall fall underneath that right permission.\n\n437\n00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,280\nSo if I want to break it down like that.\n\n438\n00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,400\nIf I want to take right and then break\nit down based on what's underneath that.\n\n439\n00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,824\nSo Write included Write Attributes,\nWrite Extended Attributes,\n\n440\n00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:17,970\nCreate Files / Write data,\nCreate Folders / Append Data.\n\n441\n00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:24,870\nSo let me just kind of move some of\nthese around to fall under that.\n\n442\n00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,870\nAnd then we'll actually have\nan organizational system in\n\n443\n00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,610\nplace here, right?\n\n444\n00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,545\nSo Create Folders is\nobviously with a folder.\n\n445\n00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n446\n00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,055\n>> We should hope.\n\n447\n00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:39,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And Append Data is with a File.\n\n448\n00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,820\nAnd then after that, we had, let's see.\n\n449\n00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,170\nWhat else fell under that?\n\n450\n00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,160\nWrite Attributes,\nWrite Extended Attributes.\n\n451\n00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,700\nSo let me get Write Attributes and\nWrite Extended Attributes and\n\n452\n00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,430\nI'll put those under Write also.\n\n453\n00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,692\nThere.\n\n454\n00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:00,167\nAnd I'm slowly running out of room.\n\n455\n00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:00,805\nOkay.\n\n456\n00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:04,895\nSo Create Folders, obviously kind\nof explains itself in the name,\n\n457\n00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:06,340\nnot much to write here.\n\n458\n00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,400\nAllows a user to\n\n459\n00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,730\ncreate subdirectories within a directory.\n\n460\n00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,390\nRight, or within a drive,\n\n461\n00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,620\nif this is applied right to the root of\nthe C drive or the D drive or whatever.\n\n462\n00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,840\nIn Windows 8, that's one of the things\nthat changed is that a regular user used\n\n463\n00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,000\nto be able to create folders right\noff the root, if they wanted to.\n\n464\n00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,370\nNot in Windows 8.\n\n465\n00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,938\nIt won't let you, you have to have\nadministrative permissions by default.\n\n466\n00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:39,737\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n467\n00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:41,460\n>> Oh, alloowing users.\n\n468\n00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,055\nLet me change that.\n\n469\n00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:43,017\nSo allows a user.\n\n470\n00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:47,300\nWow, I'm going to clean\nthis up after the show.\n\n471\n00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,430\nMy typing is horrible, and\nthere's no spell checker in notepad so\n\n472\n00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:54,050\nI should probably use some\nlegitimate typing tool.\n\n473\n00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,140\nBut basically it just allows a user to.\n\n474\n00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140\n>> Add more data?\n\n475\n00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,550\n>> Add content to a file.\n\n476\n00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:08,138\nSo really it's kinda like add\nchange content within a file.\n\n477\n00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:12,410\nSo all of those are like subsets\nof the right permission.\n\n478\n00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,870\n>> All right.\n\n479\n00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:21,140\nSo, I guess we'll jump back there and\nwe've got the right, which other one?\n\n480\n00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,260\n>> We've got Modify.\n\n481\n00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,110\nAnd, if you look at Modify,\n\n482\n00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:28,430\nsee how when I check off Modify it\nchecks off all these other ones.\n\n483\n00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:33,170\nIf you're going to be able to modify,\nactually change a file or whatever,\n\n484\n00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,490\nyou kind of need to have all\nthese other permissions to do it.\n\n485\n00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,310\nYou need to be able to read and\nwrite to them and so\n\n486\n00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,320\non, so by checking off that one it\nchecks off the ones underneath them.\n\n487\n00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,960\nAnd that's how most of these are that when\nyou check off one It may include other\n\n488\n00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,170\nattributes, so you kinda just have to\nwatch that as it sets those permissions.\n\n489\n00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:53,550\nSo when I go to Modify, a lot of the\npermissions that I see here are carried\n\n490\n00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,550\nover from the read and write permissions.\n\n491\n00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,020\nSo, Traverse folder, execute file.\n\n492\n00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,310\nThat came over from the read and execute.\n\n493\n00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,300\nList folder read data,\nthat came from read.\n\n494\n00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,200\nRead attributes,\n\n495\n00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,460\nread extended attributes, those, we\ndidn't get those permissions yet, did we?\n\n496\n00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,980\nSo I need to add those in.\n\n497\n00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,080\nThe creation, those came from the write\npermission that we already listed.\n\n498\n00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,090\nDelete and read permission.\n\n499\n00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,280\nNow, delete is the big difference here.\n\n500\n00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,730\nBeing able to write to a file is\none thing, you can change the file.\n\n501\n00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,530\nBut you can't delete it unless you\nactually have those delete permissions.\n\n502\n00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,760\nAnd so Modify is bringing that in.\n\n503\n00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:35,930\nSo it's adding that delete permission,\nas well as the ability to read and so on.\n\n504\n00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,490\nSo let's.\n\n505\n00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,110\nOops.\n\n506\n00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,750\nYou know, that is just bizarre.\n\n507\n00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,690\nAll right.\n\n508\n00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,570\nSo it's giving us delete,\nit's giving us read permissions.\n\n509\n00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,580\nWhat else did we get?\n\n510\n00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,880\nRead attributes, read extended attributes.\n\n511\n00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,910\nWhich I could have swore I\nalready put in here, didn't I?\n\n512\n00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,600\nI guess not.\n\n513\n00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,770\nSo let me add them.\n\n514\n00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,320\n>> I thought you did too.\n\n515\n00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,120\n>> Oh, you know what?\nI did write attributes and\n\n516\n00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,240\nwrite extended attributes.\n\n517\n00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,320\nI didn't do read.\n\n518\n00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,600\nSo let me just copy those,\nsave me a little time.\n\n519\n00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,340\nSo it's gonna add those.\n\n520\n00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:14,817\nWhich will allow a user to\nview the file attributes,\n\n521\n00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:18,200\nnot to actually change them.\n\n522\n00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,020\nSo they're getting that.\n\n523\n00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,720\nNow they've already got the ability to\nchange them coming over from the right\n\n524\n00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,510\nside of things.\n\n525\n00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,880\nHere they're getting that\nability to view them.\n\n526\n00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720\nAnd if I just assign view.\n\n527\n00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,930\nDid we not get write when we did that?\n\n528\n00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,970\nI thought we did.\n\n529\n00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,150\nLet's verify.\n\n530\n00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,880\nSo if I just do write, you know,\nif you just type write,\n\n531\n00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,380\nyou actually don't get permission to\nview them, a little bizarre thing there.\n\n532\n00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n533\n00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,710\nYeah, there was like a scenario.\n\n534\n00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,040\nIf you had a program that\nwas writing something,\n\n535\n00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,520\nlet's say if it was if you're\ntyping up a report or something,\n\n536\n00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,910\nand that report needed to be submitted\nTo a folder of everybody else's reports.\n\n537\n00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,820\nYou would have to be able\nto write to that folder.\n\n538\n00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,680\nBut if the teacher didn't want\nthe user to look in there and\n\n539\n00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,020\nlook at anybody else's reports or\nwhatnot, then they wouldn't have reads.\n\n540\n00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,950\nYou couldn't look into that folder,\nbut you had write over that folder so\n\n541\n00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,400\nyou could put your report in there.\n\n542\n00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,200\nBut you couldn't get in there and\nlook at anybody else's.\n\n543\n00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,040\nA very specific scenario, but who knows.\n\n544\n00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,030\n>> And you may need it.\n\n545\n00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,170\nNow one thing I want to point out is,\n\n546\n00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,800\nI'm going to go back here\nto turning on Modify.\n\n547\n00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,210\nSo let me turn Modify on in my system.\n\n548\n00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,610\nAnd when you go into Show Advanced,\n\n549\n00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,755\nModify gives you all almost everything,\nall right?\n\n550\n00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:32,000\nModify just leaves out three things.\n\n551\n00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,690\nFull control, change permissions,\nand take ownership.\n\n552\n00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,080\nAnd if I turn on full control,\n\n553\n00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,030\nwhen I go back I'll see that I get that\nchange permissions and take ownership.\n\n554\n00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,760\nSo let me add that to my notes here.\n\n555\n00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:52,572\nFull control,\nwhich gives us change permissions.\n\n556\n00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:57,360\nChange permissions and take ownership.\n\n557\n00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,270\nNow these are some big permissions\nright here, these last two.\n\n558\n00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,860\nWhen you can modify the contents and\ndelete the contents,\n\n559\n00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,300\nthat sounds like you can do pretty much\neverything, but change permissions,\n\n560\n00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,330\nwe already talked about\na little bit right here.\n\n561\n00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,960\nWhich is that's what's actually\ngoing to let us get in there and\n\n562\n00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,730\nstart to change what's going on.\n\n563\n00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,760\nWhat's going inside of that folder as\nfar as who's allowed to access it,\n\n564\n00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,990\nwho's not allowed to access it.\n\n565\n00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,820\nSame thing with a file,\nwho can and can't get to it.\n\n566\n00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,200\nIf you're ever locked out of a file,\nright?\n\n567\n00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,080\nSo as an admin if a user locks us out of\na file, we can always exercise the highest\n\n568\n00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,560\npermission, which is this guy right here,\nTake ownership.\n\n569\n00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,390\nEven if we're explicitly\ndenied access on the file.\n\n570\n00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,740\nWe can seize ownership, and\ntake it by force, right?\n\n571\n00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,750\nAnd that's what this last one is.\n\n572\n00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,760\nSo that's a big deal.\n\n573\n00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,610\nIf somebody has take ownership permission,\nthey can not get locked out of the file.\n\n574\n00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,820\nSomebody can try, but\nthey can always seize ownership back.\n\n575\n00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:58,050\nSo, allows the user to seize\nownership to gain access to a file.\n\n576\n00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,050\n>> Yeah, you know and\nwith the full control.\n\n577\n00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,010\nSo that change permission also allows\n\n578\n00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,010\nthe a person to add people to\nthe access control list, and\n\n579\n00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,870\ndelegate who else can have access to\nthis file and folder and whatnot.\n\n580\n00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,970\n>> Yep.\nAnd so that's one of the reasons I\n\n581\n00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,830\nwanted to kind of write this list down\na slightly different way was because\n\n582\n00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,510\nwhen we talked about changing permissions,\n\n583\n00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,630\nwe were talking about writing, and\nI wanted to make sure that you guys out in\n\n584\n00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,400\nTV land understood that those\nwere two separate things.\n\n585\n00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,780\nJust because you can write to a file\ndoesn't mean you can change its\n\n586\n00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,720\npermissions.\n\n587\n00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,590\nThat having write access allows\nyou to change what's in that file,\n\n588\n00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,080\nor create new files, but it doesn't\nallow you to change permissions.\n\n589\n00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,770\nFor that you have to have full control.\n\n590\n00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,080\nSo this list right here, basically these\nare the basic permissions right here,\n\n591\n00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,700\nand then when we go into advanced view,\nhere's the breakdown of what they are.\n\n592\n00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,510\nAnd for a lot of these, the breakdown\nis simply whether it's a file or\n\n593\n00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,740\na folder, right?\n\n594\n00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,240\nBut on other ones,\nthere are actually different behaviors.\n\n595\n00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,930\nAnd you may want to give somebody\nthe ability to read permissions but\n\n596\n00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,680\nnot the ability to read attributes, right?\n\n597\n00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,890\nI don't know why but maybe you want that.\n\n598\n00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:14,490\nIn which case, you'll need to go\nadvanced and start to customize things.\n\n599\n00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,490\nAnd when you do that,\nwhen you customize them, so like,\n\n600\n00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,140\nif I go in here, and I want somebody.\n\n601\n00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,780\nLet me go back here.\n\n602\n00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,770\nSo, I want somebody to be able to read and\nwrite and all that, but\n\n603\n00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,530\nI don't want them to be able to read\nattributes and change the attributes.\n\n604\n00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,138\nSo I'm just gonna remove those little\nparts that deal with the attributes.\n\n605\n00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:31,723\nAll right.\n\n606\n00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n607\n00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,880\n>> When I go back,\nsee how nothing is checked anymore?\n\n608\n00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,140\nExcept special permissions.\n\n609\n00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,520\nThat means that I've got a configuration\nin place that doesn't match up\n\n610\n00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,270\nwith one of the canned settings.\n\n611\n00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,220\nAnd so now I'm custom, I'm specialized.\n\n612\n00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,900\nRight, so let me just add that here.\n\n613\n00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,320\nI pimped my permissions.\n\n614\n00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,730\nWow, and we'll put some spinners on them.\n\n615\n00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,350\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n616\n00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,818\n>> And then we're in business.\n\n617\n00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:57,093\nCustomized.\n\n618\n00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:59,890\nSo, I wonder if we can\nget Xzibit on the show.\n\n619\n00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,450\n>> Oh my gosh.\n>> You think he'd do it?\n\n620\n00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,922\nProbably not.\n\n621\n00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:03,990\n>> If you ask nicely.\n\n622\n00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,406\n>> Well, you never know.\n\n623\n00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,530\nYou say please,\nall sorts of things happen.\n\n624\n00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:13,297\nSo let me just put here,\nspecial permissions\n\n625\n00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:18,762\nshows up when we have assigned permissions\n\n626\n00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:24,090\nthat do not match up\nwith any of the above.\n\n627\n00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,218\n>> So it'll show up when\nthere's cash at a big party.\n\n628\n00:32:27,218 --> 00:32:29,250\n[INAUDIBLE] pimped out.\n\n629\n00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,650\n>> There you go.\n\n630\n00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,530\n>> Terrible joke.\n\n631\n00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,950\nI tried to fit that one in,\n>> Yeah\n\n632\n00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,430\n>> but the delivery of it wasn't there.\n\n633\n00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,210\n>> All right.\n\n634\n00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,890\nWell, I'm gonna clean this list up\na little bit more during the break, and\n\n635\n00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,275\nlooking at the time,\nit is time for that break.\n\n636\n00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:42,815\nSo, why don't we stop here?\n\n637\n00:32:42,815 --> 00:32:46,075\nSo far, we've just been talking\nabout the permissions themselves.\n\n638\n00:32:46,075 --> 00:32:49,335\nWhen we get back, I wanna talk a little\nbit more about actually applying those\n\n639\n00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:50,695\npermissions and how they work.\n\n640\n00:32:50,695 --> 00:32:51,585\nAnd what we need to watch out for\n\n641\n00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:54,567\nwhen we design how we're gonna we're\ngonna use permissions in our environment.\n\n642\n00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:55,577\nAll right.\n>> Yep, that's good.\n\n643\n00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,367\n>> So, anything else to throw\nin before we go to break?\n\n644\n00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:58,827\n>> We're good.\n>> All right, ladies and\n\n645\n00:32:58,827 --> 00:32:59,617\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n646\n00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:01,649\nWhen we get back,\nmore permissions after this.\n\n647\n00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:07,398\n[MUSIC]\n\n648\n00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:11,280\nYou know official.\n\n649\n00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,687\nWelcome back to IT Pro TV\nanother great break.\n\n650\n00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:18,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're getting back in to more\n\n651\n00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,635\npermission stuff.\n\n652\n00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:21,350\nThat we have lined up.\n\n653\n00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,620\n>> Now Don, as we were talking on break.\n\n654\n00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,750\nSo these permissions Right.\n\n655\n00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:32,680\nThere's a lot of them, and they can get\nkind of hairy to absorb and to take in.\n\n656\n00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:38,650\nAnd the thought of trying to assign\nthese permissions to all your files and\n\n657\n00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,510\nfolders, I mean, it can be a pretty\nunmanageable task, pretty quick.\n\n658\n00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:47,200\nSo it brings forth this idea\nof Inheritable permissions.\n\n659\n00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,510\nAnd how permissions are assigned and\nthey just kinda cascade down, and\n\n660\n00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,480\nmake assigning permissions much,\nmuch easier.\n\n661\n00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,680\n>> Yeah, and so, you know, a lot of people\nwill use a Windows computer for years and\n\n662\n00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,890\nnever even think about the permissions,\nright.\n\n663\n00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,870\nThey're just there,\nthey didn't even worry about it.\n\n664\n00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,180\nAnd that's because Microsoft puts some\ndefault permissions on your system,\n\n665\n00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,640\nthey're there already.\n\n666\n00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,830\nAs you create new files and new folders.\n\n667\n00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,510\nThat new stuff you create\nit's just inheriting,\n\n668\n00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,320\nit's copying the permissions that\nare already there over to the new content.\n\n669\n00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,670\nSo, if you don't know anything about\npermissions fine, doesnt matter,\n\n670\n00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,615\nright you can run like that.\n\n671\n00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:26,060\nIt's only when you want to customize them\nthat you really need to be aware of all\n\n672\n00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,220\nthe different settings and\nwhat they do, and how they work, or\n\n673\n00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,070\nif your gonna take the exam.\n\n674\n00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,790\nProbably a good idea to\nknow them then too, right?\n\n675\n00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,600\nThat is the other time.\n\n676\n00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,120\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout inheritance, right.\n\n677\n00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,080\nI whipped up a simple diagram\nduring the break to try and show.\n\n678\n00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,040\nAt the factory, when Microsoft builds that\n\n679\n00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,680\nimage of Windows 8 that they roll\nout to the machines that we buy.\n\n680\n00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,880\nBasically, they set some permissions.\n\n681\n00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,270\nAnd at a minimum,\nthere are some permissions that are set\n\n682\n00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,410\nright on the root of our hard drive,\nright on C:/.\n\n683\n00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:04,190\nAnd those permissions trickle down\nto the subfolders underneath.\n\n684\n00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,330\nAnd from the subfolders, they trickle\ndown to additional subfolders,\n\n685\n00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:13,420\nas well as the files inside of them,\nand so on.\n\n686\n00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,770\nSo, if at the C:\\ directory,\n\n687\n00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,210\nat that directory if I have permission\nthat says everyone has full control.\n\n688\n00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,300\nThat trickles down to\neverything underneath, so\n\n689\n00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,140\nthat everyone would have full\ncontrol of Report.xls, for example.\n\n690\n00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,730\nAll right.\n\n691\n00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,390\nAnd as you create new things, they're\ninheriting those permissions, right?\n\n692\n00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,950\nIt's real easy to see in action.\n\n693\n00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,070\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n694\n00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,750\nLet me just go to my desktop here.\n\n695\n00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,630\nSo here I am on my desktop.\n\n696\n00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,600\nAnd I'm gonna create a new document.\n\n697\n00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,720\nI'm just gonna come in here, and\nI'll create a new rich text document, or\n\n698\n00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,090\nI'll do a text document.\n\n699\n00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,035\nAnd I'll put in here, Nate's passwords.\n\n700\n00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:51,950\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> And I'll put in all of Nate's passwords\n\n701\n00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,550\nthat I know.\n\n702\n00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,150\n>> Yay!\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n703\n00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,650\n>> All right?\n\n704\n00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,730\nSo anyhow, so I got this file.\n\n705\n00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,810\nAnd I can go in and I can change it.\n\n706\n00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,420\nThis is text.\n\n707\n00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,300\nAwesome.\n\n708\n00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,820\nAlright.\nSo there we go, right.\n\n709\n00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,650\nNow, I've not set any permissions\non this file, but it's got them.\n\n710\n00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,080\nIf I pull up the properties of it, and\n\n711\n00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,730\nI go into security,\nI can see the system has access.\n\n712\n00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,950\nDon Posset has access.\n\n713\n00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,250\nAdministrators have access.\n\n714\n00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,090\nThese permissions came from somewhere.\n\n715\n00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,180\nAnd when I click on those.\n\n716\n00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,380\nIf I go to, like, edit, right?\n\n717\n00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,460\nNotice, down at the bottom,\nall the checkmarks are grayed out, and\n\n718\n00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,440\nI can't change them.\n\n719\n00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,910\nI'm trying to click on them here,\nand I can't.\n\n720\n00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,410\nSo if I decide that.\n\n721\n00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,121\nI don't want administrators to\nhave access, I can't change them.\n\n722\n00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:38,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And the reason is they're inherited.\n\n723\n00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,210\nInherited permissions aren't\nset here on this file they're\n\n724\n00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,670\nset on the parent object.\n\n725\n00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,160\nThey're coming from somewhere else.\n\n726\n00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000\nThey're trickling down to this folder.\n\n727\n00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,355\nI can add to them, but I can't change it,\nat least not at this level.\n\n728\n00:36:51,355 --> 00:36:52,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n729\n00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,850\nYeah so, did you want to get into like,\nbreaking inheritance [INAUDIBLE].\n\n730\n00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,640\n>> We could, yeah.\n\n731\n00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,952\n>> Or, like deny, whatever.\n\n732\n00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:02,200\n>> So sure, the default is\nwhenever you create something new,\n\n733\n00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,860\nit's gonna inherit those permissions.\n\n734\n00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,450\nBut we don't always have to do that,\ndo we Nate?\n\n735\n00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,580\n>> No, not always.\n\n736\n00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,790\nSo there is a thing called\ndisabling inheritance, and so\n\n737\n00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:14,270\nyou can kind of break ties\nfrom that parent folder.\n\n738\n00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,710\nSo that you can set permissions.\n\n739\n00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,870\nSo, you know,\nthe stuff's not grayed out anymore and\n\n740\n00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,970\nyou can click on it and\nbend it to your will.\n\n741\n00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,570\nSo in the Advanced option.\n\n742\n00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,760\nWhen that pulls up there is a little\nbutton down there that says\n\n743\n00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,700\ndisable inheritance.\n\n744\n00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,910\nThat will break the ties\nfrom its parent folder or\n\n745\n00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:38,380\nthe folder that's just up the tree that's\nkind of controlling it, yep, puppets.\n\n746\n00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,880\n>> Now, when you do it, it gives you\none of my favorite screens here.\n\n747\n00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,540\nBecause it's gonna ask\nus what we wanna do.\n\n748\n00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:48,020\nDo we wanna just delete all\nthe permissions, wipe it out and\n\n749\n00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,530\nthen start from scratch or\n\n750\n00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,830\ndo we wanna go ahead and just create\na exact copy of what's there, allright.\n\n751\n00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,390\nThe reason I like this one so\n\n752\n00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,460\nmuch is that you almost always\nwanna just copy what's there.\n\n753\n00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,190\nIf you delete everything, if you remove\nit all and then accidentally say okay or\n\n754\n00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:03,170\nwhatever, you affectively lock\nyourself out of the file.\n\n755\n00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,290\nNow, you can still seize ownership\nof it and gain access but\n\n756\n00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,790\nit is kind of annoying.\n\n757\n00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,130\nI don't really even know why\nthey have that option there.\n\n758\n00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,260\nUsually, we'll say convert inherited\npermissions into explicit permissions.\n\n759\n00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,810\nExplicit permissions are ones that\nare assigned on the file itself.\n\n760\n00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,870\nAnd those are the ones that we can change.\n\n761\n00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,420\nIf I choose to convert, right?\n\n762\n00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,010\nSo I'm gonna convert them and\nI'll say okay to that.\n\n763\n00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,170\nNow, when I go and\n\n764\n00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,910\nedit the permissions, see how\nthe boxes aren't grayed out any more?\n\n765\n00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,745\nNow I can change them, right?\n\n766\n00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,700\nCuz, they're not being inherited anymore.\n\n767\n00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,330\nNow, they're being set here\non this individual file.\n\n768\n00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,390\nAnd if I wanted I could go in and\nstart to remove things.\n\n769\n00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,020\nAnd clear it out so only I have access.\n\n770\n00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,800\nNo other users on this computer,\nnot even the system account.\n\n771\n00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,490\nI don't even want this computer\nto know about these files.\n\n772\n00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,883\nWhich is kinda silly, but anyhow.\n\n773\n00:38:51,883 --> 00:38:53,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll set those.\n\n774\n00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,370\nAnd now it's just me.\n\n775\n00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:55,970\nI know about it.\n\n776\n00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,580\nI have access to this file.\n\n777\n00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580\nAnd there we go, I've blocked inheritance.\n\n778\n00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,470\nWe typically do that when we\nwant to be more restrictive on\n\n779\n00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,535\na folder than what\npermissions trickle down.\n\n780\n00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:05,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n781\n00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:10,760\nAlright, so Don, if you create a folder,\nand block inheritance from it,\n\n782\n00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,820\nthe files and folders, or\nthe subfolders that you create in that.\n\n783\n00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,900\nWill they inherit the permissions\nthat are on that folder.\n\n784\n00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,490\n>> They actually will, yeah.\n\n785\n00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,200\nSo it does get confusing, right.\n\n786\n00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,060\nSo if I create a new folder, so I'll just\ncreate a folder called Don's folder.\n\n787\n00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:30,045\nAnd on Don's folder I'm\ngonna go into security and\n\n788\n00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,630\nI'm gonna disable inheritance.\n\n789\n00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,300\nSo I'm gonna do that and I'll just choose\nto remove it all, I'm gonna go crazy.\n\n790\n00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,190\nAnd I'll go ahead and add in cuz, I need\nto at least add somebody In there, right?\n\n791\n00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,560\nSo I'm gonna add myself in,\nif I can find myself.\n\n792\n00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,280\nI've got to find myself.\n\n793\n00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,560\nAll right.\n\n794\n00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,030\nSo I'm gonna find myself here, and\nI'll give myself full control.\n\n795\n00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:52,990\nAll right.\n\n796\n00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,010\nSo there we go, I created a folder,\nI am the only one who has access,\n\n797\n00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,270\nI blocked inheritance.\n\n798\n00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,610\nIf I go into that folder, and\nI create some new file, or new folder.\n\n799\n00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,710\nDoesn't matter, either one.\n\n800\n00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,191\nRight, I'll do a new folder,\nand maybe a new file also.\n\n801\n00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:09,988\nOkay, when I create those,\ntheir inheriting from the parent.\n\n802\n00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:12,646\nThey've got to get their first set\nof permissions from somewhere.\n\n803\n00:40:12,646 --> 00:40:15,048\nSo they'll inherit from the parent.\n\n804\n00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:20,110\nAnd sure enough, I'm the only one\nthat has access to those files.\n\n805\n00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:26,085\n>> So then, so yeah, so I, from what,\nhere I am collecting my thoughts.\n\n806\n00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:30,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, having a good structure of quarters\n\n807\n00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,880\nto lay out folders in a logical way.\n\n808\n00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,380\nThen this thing, it wouldn't be that\nbad to try to manage that sort.\n\n809\n00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,080\nSo you could just do it once at\nthe parent folder, and set something for\n\n810\n00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,990\nlike the Sales folder.\n\n811\n00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,520\nYou can set the Disable Inheritance.\n\n812\n00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,590\nSet your permissions of what you want for\nthat Sales folder.\n\n813\n00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,720\nAnd as long as you create things under\nthat Sales folder, nest things in there,\n\n814\n00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,350\nthen it will inherit\nthe permissions before.\n\n815\n00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,170\nSo, it's not like you have\nto break everything and\n\n816\n00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,210\nassign everything down below.\n\n817\n00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,510\nYou can just do it one step up and\nthen those will inherit down.\n\n818\n00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,230\nAnd make things a bit easier to manage.\n\n819\n00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,900\n>> Yeah.\n\n820\n00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,160\nSo as we design our permissions,\nwe need to think about that, right?\n\n821\n00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,290\nSo let's say that I've got a file server.\n\n822\n00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,290\nI'm using my Windows 8 machine\nas a file server, right?\n\n823\n00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,320\nSo on my C drive,\n\n824\n00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,000\nmaybe I'll set it up for everyone full\ncontrol, which would be crazy talk.\n\n825\n00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,565\nBut maybe I will.\n\n826\n00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:19,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n827\n00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,870\nWell, if I create a Sales and\na Marketing folder, Everyone,\n\n828\n00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,670\nFull Control is gonna trickle down to it.\n\n829\n00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,500\nAnd if I'm in Sales or if I'm in\nMarketing, I can get at either folder and\n\n830\n00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,810\ndo whatever I want.\n\n831\n00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,200\nThat's probably not what we want, right?\n\n832\n00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,840\nAnd so what we're more than likely gonna\nneed to do is to block inheritance, right?\n\n833\n00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:41,340\nSo we're gonna go in and say hey, instead\nof letting this stuff trickle down like it\n\n834\n00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,790\nis right now, let's go ahead and\njust block that inheritance so\n\n835\n00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,310\nthat when it passes down here,\nit'll just get blocked.\n\n836\n00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:52,040\nAnd when it passes down,\nhere it'll get blocked.\n\n837\n00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,940\nAnd then, at those levels, we can start to\nspecify more specific permissions, right?\n\n838\n00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:03,170\nSo I might want to come in and\nspecify at the sales level,\n\n839\n00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,890\nI might want to come in and say,\nfor example, Everyone, Read only.\n\n840\n00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,950\nOk, so if I say everyone Read.\n\n841\n00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,123\nI'll just say read because that's\nthe actual permission name.\n\n842\n00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:22,660\nLet me change this to,\nwhat color am I going to use to draw with?\n\n843\n00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,920\nI'll use green.\n\n844\n00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,220\n>> Everybody likes green.\n\n845\n00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:33,452\nSo if I assign Everyone, Read and\nthe sales team, Full Control.\n\n846\n00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:34,683\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n847\n00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:36,330\n>> All right?\n\n848\n00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:40,100\nWhat's gonna happen is,\nsince I've blocked inheritance,\n\n849\n00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,440\nthese permissions that I drew in red,\nthey're not gonna come down here anymore.\n\n850\n00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,910\nBut other things that I'm gonna draw, are.\n\n851\n00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,940\nSo anyhow, these permissions\naren't gonna come down anymore, so\n\n852\n00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,310\nI'm just gonna delete them out.\n\n853\n00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,990\nBut the new permissions that we create,\nthey're going to start to trickle down.\n\n854\n00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:01,440\nSo I'll see them come from this\nSales folder right here and\n\n855\n00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,100\nthey'll trickle down to my Notes file.\n\n856\n00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,890\nThey'll trickle down to\nthe Pricing folder and\n\n857\n00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,480\nin turn trickle all\nthe way down to Reports.\n\n858\n00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,010\nRight?\nSo\n\n859\n00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,205\nthose permissions are gonna follow that\ninheritance all the way down the line.\n\n860\n00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:13,442\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n861\n00:43:13,442 --> 00:43:19,120\nAll right, so Don, so there is a way that\nyou can control who has access to files,\n\n862\n00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,440\nnot only by blocking inheritance, but\nby denying the user access to that.\n\n863\n00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,305\nNow, let me get your professional opinion.\n\n864\n00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,582\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, when you are designing out\n\n865\n00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:33,210\na structure for files and whatnot,\nwould you disable inheritance and\n\n866\n00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,990\nset things up this way, or would you just\ngo through and deny and use the deny?\n\n867\n00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,480\n>> So I would disable inheritance.\n\n868\n00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,420\nDenies, denies are a funny thing.\n\n869\n00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,580\nNormally when we assign permissions,\nwe're allowing something, or\n\n870\n00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,620\nwe're just not giving it.\n\n871\n00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,810\nThere is a third state.\n\n872\n00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,960\nThere's really three states for\nevery permission.\n\n873\n00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,400\nThere's a allow, there's deny,\nand there's nothing.\n\n874\n00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,170\nOkay?\n\n875\n00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,450\nSo if you have nothing, if you have no\npermissions to a folder whatsoever,\n\n876\n00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,400\nyou don't have allow or deny.\n\n877\n00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,560\nYou don't get access.\n\n878\n00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,670\nSo you're effectively denied.\n\n879\n00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:09,860\nThe thing, oh go ahead.\n\n880\n00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,610\n>> And that is implicit.\n\n881\n00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,360\nThose are implicit.\n\n882\n00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,200\nWould you call it implicit permissions?\n\n883\n00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,420\nYeah.\n>> So implicit,\n\n884\n00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,340\nif you're not on the list\nyou don't get in.\n\n885\n00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,040\n>> That's right.\n\n886\n00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,260\nIt's not specifically,\nit's not explicitly in the list.\n\n887\n00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,990\nIt's implied that it's there.\n\n888\n00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,260\nThat if you're not in the list,\nyou're a block.\n\n889\n00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,300\nSo if I wanted to set up an environment\nlike this where everyone had read,\n\n890\n00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,940\nthe Sales team had full control, well,\n\n891\n00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,810\nif I'm in the Marketing group, I'm a part\nof Everyone, and I get access, right?\n\n892\n00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:44,660\nWell, what if I didn't want\nthe Marketing group to have access?\n\n893\n00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,250\nWell, the Marketing group's\nnot on the list here, so\n\n894\n00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,190\nthe Marketing group\ntechnically has nothing, right?\n\n895\n00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,310\nBut the users in the Marketing\ngroup will also be in Everyone, so\n\n896\n00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,230\nthey're still gonna get access.\n\n897\n00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:59,340\nSo I might say to myself, I want to\nkeep the Marketing group out of there so\n\n898\n00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,150\nlet me deny them the access.\n\n899\n00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,590\nAnd so we might add to this list and\nput in marketing denied.\n\n900\n00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,860\nAll right.\n\n901\n00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,430\nAnd so\nlet me just add that to the list here.\n\n902\n00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,732\nSo, if we put that in.\n\n903\n00:45:15,564 --> 00:45:16,430\nAll right.\n\n904\n00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,720\nIf I put that in,\nthat's going to trickle down, right?\n\n905\n00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,146\nSo, the marketing department\nis now denied access.\n\n906\n00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:27,594\nBut what if the CEO of my company\nis in the Sales group and\n\n907\n00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:30,735\nhe's in the Marketing group.\n\n908\n00:45:30,735 --> 00:45:34,270\nHe's in both so that he can have\naccess to all of their files.\n\n909\n00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:39,030\nWell, now that I'm denying Marketing\non the Sales group, if someones in both\n\n910\n00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,590\nSales and Marketing, when they come to\nthis folder they're going to get denied.\n\n911\n00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,540\nThey're going to get denied even\nthough the Sales team has Full Control\n\n912\n00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,950\nbecause they're in that marketing group\nthey're going to get denied also.\n\n913\n00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,960\nThat's the problem with denies.\n\n914\n00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,350\nDenies override everything.\n\n915\n00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:57,590\nNormally, with permissions,\nyou get the best of both worlds, right?\n\n916\n00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,800\nSo if I'm in Sales and Marketing,\nI get everything the sales team gets, and\n\n917\n00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,230\nI get everything the marketing team gets.\n\n918\n00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,960\nIt's great, right?\n\n919\n00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,590\nBut if there's a deny out there,\nit overrides all that.\n\n920\n00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,330\nAnd so you could have salespeople that\nare getting locked out of this folder,\n\n921\n00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,090\nbecause of the deny.\n\n922\n00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:17,670\nMicrosoft's own advice is to\nuse denies extremely sparingly.\n\n923\n00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,610\nDon't use them wherever you don't have to,\nand\n\n924\n00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,850\nif you do use them make\nsure you document it so\n\n925\n00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,540\nthat everybody is aware because it's going\nto modify the behavior of that folder.\n\n926\n00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,980\nIt's going to make things act weird.\n\n927\n00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,550\nRight.\n\n928\n00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:34,110\nSo on the exam, my rule of thumb is that\ndenies are typically the wrong answer.\n\n929\n00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,250\nSo if you're having to pick between\nvarious answers on a question, denies,\n\n930\n00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,960\nit really should be your last thing.\n\n931\n00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,480\nIf there's no other choice that\ngives you a good solution,\n\n932\n00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,430\nthen you go with they deny.\n\n933\n00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,460\nBut you need to use them very sparingly.\n\n934\n00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,140\nNow, I'm not sure if you want\nto get into conditions now.\n\n935\n00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,270\nI don't want to get too far away,\nbut conditions are another way to\n\n936\n00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,990\ndeny or allow based off of conditions.\n\n937\n00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n938\n00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,310\n>> A better way to.\n\n939\n00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,840\n>> Let's talk about it now and\nthen we can get back into permissions.\n\n940\n00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,580\nSomething new in Windows 8.\n\n941\n00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,990\nAnd because it's new,\n\n942\n00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,590\nthat basically translates into\nthat will show up on the exam.\n\n943\n00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:20,310\nSomething new in Windows 8 beyond just\nour permissions we can now define\n\n944\n00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,022\nall sorts of stuff right?\n\n945\n00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:26,390\nAs other, I'm trying to say not\nconditions, other criteria for\n\n946\n00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,680\naccess or whatever.\n\n947\n00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,470\n>> Yeah, yeah, so\nyeah the conditions allows for\n\n948\n00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:37,550\nmore advanced permissions, right,\n\n949\n00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:42,610\nthat you can assign to a file or a folder.\n\n950\n00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:43,770\n>> You know, it's kind of hard to explain.\n\n951\n00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:47,000\nLet me show because it's one of those\nthings that easier to see, right?\n\n952\n00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,770\nSo, I'm connected to a Windows 8 machine.\n\n953\n00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:51,640\nNow, quick, quick note here.\n\n954\n00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,890\nWe had a bit of a debate before this show.\n\n955\n00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:59,080\nIf you have a Windows 8 laptop like\nmine that is not joined to a domain,\n\n956\n00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,080\nconditions don't show up.\n\n957\n00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,620\nThey're just not even there, all right?\n\n958\n00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,849\nSo it's got to be Windows\n8 joined to a domain.\n\n959\n00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:05,810\nThat's why I'm remoting\ninto another computer here.\n\n960\n00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:10,303\nSo, I'm remoted into another Windows 8\ncomputer that is joined to a domain And\n\n961\n00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:13,666\nI'm gonna create a new folder\nwhich I'll call marketing.\n\n962\n00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,700\nAnd I'm gonna.\n\n963\n00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,780\n>> Marketing\n>> I'll pull up the Security here and\n\n964\n00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,810\nI'll go into Advanced, right.\n\n965\n00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,170\nAnd so\nhere's where we set those permissions for\n\n966\n00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,370\nwho we want to have access and so on.\n\n967\n00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:31,470\nSo I can come in here, and I can add,\nmaybe I'll add permissions for me.\n\n968\n00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:36,040\nSo I'm going to add Don Pezet,\nnot Donald Duck.\n\n969\n00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,990\nThere we go.\n\n970\n00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,860\nAnd so I'm going to give myself\nfull control of this folder.\n\n971\n00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,420\nI want me to have full control.\n\n972\n00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:48,870\nBut then right down here I can add\nConditions to that full control, right?\n\n973\n00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:56,220\nSo I can come in here and I can say, if\nthe device is within a particular group.\n\n974\n00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,985\nSo if I'm sitting in a computer\nthat's in a particular group or\n\n975\n00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:07,065\nwith my user account, I can say, if\nthe user is in a particular group, right?\n\n976\n00:49:07,065 --> 00:49:12,715\nSo I can say like give them full control\n\n977\n00:49:12,715 --> 00:49:17,070\nif they are in one group but\naren't in another.\n\n978\n00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,480\nSo, let's change this,\nI'm gonna change my principle to everyone.\n\n979\n00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,350\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna give everyone full control and\n\n980\n00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:33,720\nthen in here for my conditions,\nI'll say, if the user is not\n\n981\n00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,250\na member of and\nthen we can specify a group.\n\n982\n00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,352\nWhich I don't know what groups we have so\nlet's see what we got.\n\n983\n00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:42,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess I could\n\n984\n00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,800\nhave created a group earlier.\n\n985\n00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:47,770\n>> Cert publishers.\n\n986\n00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,270\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, dial up.\n\n987\n00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:48,880\n>> Dial up.\n\n988\n00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,335\nAll right.\n>> Yeah, I really want those guys.\n\n989\n00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,160\n>> Stinking dial-up users.\n\n990\n00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, there we go.\n\n991\n00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,480\nSo I'll say here,\nI'm gonna allow everyone full control.\n\n992\n00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,070\nEverybody, unless as long as\nthey're not a member of the,\n\n993\n00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,070\nand I just picked that dial-up group.\n\n994\n00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,600\nI mean you could add\nmore groups right here.\n\n995\n00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,740\nSo these are kind of like denies.\n\n996\n00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,540\nYou're saying that this permission\ndoesn't apply when they're also in this\n\n997\n00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,280\nparticular group.\n\n998\n00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:18,150\nSo a way to selectively apply\ncertain permissions and\n\n999\n00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,390\nreally a lot of power there.\n\n1000\n00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,710\nAnd you can add several conditions, right?\n\n1001\n00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,715\nSo I can come in there and\nsay and or or, right?\n\n1002\n00:50:25,715 --> 00:50:31,280\n>> So I can say if they're not\na member of that group and\n\n1003\n00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,839\nthey're a member of some other group,\n\n1004\n00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:39,160\nright, cert publishers or whatever.\n\n1005\n00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,300\nSo this is allowing me to refine it, and\nif you're using conditions like these,\n\n1006\n00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,180\nthere really is no time\nwhen you would use denies.\n\n1007\n00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,680\nThere's no reason to use\ndenies if you got conditions.\n\n1008\n00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,100\nOne thing I do think that is pretty\ncool with conditions is that you can\n\n1009\n00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,940\nset to computers.\n\n1010\n00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,950\nSo you can lock it down to,\nwell these users,\n\n1011\n00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:02,620\nthey can logon but\nonly if they were at a certain computer.\n\n1012\n00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:07,180\nOr not if they're at a computer, like\nif you had a kiosk machine or something\n\n1013\n00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,800\nout there and you don't want your\nusers logging into it to do something.\n\n1014\n00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,637\n>> yeah, yeah\n>> And\n\n1015\n00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:15,280\nyou can lock it down with conditions.\n\n1016\n00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,300\n>> You know if a hacker has\nmanaged to get the credentials of\n\n1017\n00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,770\none of your user accounts, and\nthey are VPN-ing in or something.\n\n1018\n00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,340\nIf they're not one of your machines,\nyou know you can say,\n\n1019\n00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,120\nif you're not on one of our machines\nthen you're not allowed that access.\n\n1020\n00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,750\nSo you've effectively stopped that.\n\n1021\n00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,040\nThey would have to gain physical\naccess to one of your machines.\n\n1022\n00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,570\nSo it is a neat level of\npermissions that you can set up.\n\n1023\n00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,500\nVery cool, very new to Windows 8,\n\n1024\n00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,090\nand like I mentioned earlier,\nonly works when you're in a domain.\n\n1025\n00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,910\nDoesn't even show up, right?\n\n1026\n00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,550\nSo like if I go back to\nthe screens I was on earlier.\n\n1027\n00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:45,930\nWhere was that, my desktop?\n\n1028\n00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:48,640\nI think it was on my desktop.\n\n1029\n00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,720\nDon's folder.\n\n1030\n00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,260\nSo if I go in here and\nI go to Security and Advanced.\n\n1031\n00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,180\nRight?\nAnd I go into,\n\n1032\n00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,670\nlet's see adding permissions.\n\n1033\n00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:04,340\nSo in here, I can select a principle and\n\n1034\n00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,230\nsee how I don't even have that\nConditions Option down here.\n\n1035\n00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,840\nIf you're in a domain,\nyou get that extra area.\n\n1036\n00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,072\nIf you're not in a domain, you don't.\n\n1037\n00:52:12,072 --> 00:52:15,090\n>> You know earlier today I was\ntalking to the other host here,\n\n1038\n00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,330\nMike Rodrick, about this very thing and\n\n1039\n00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:20,140\nhe was explaining to me that this\nis like the tip of the iceberg.\n\n1040\n00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,840\nSo conditions is just a small\npart here with Windows 8.\n\n1041\n00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,820\nAnd the bigger pictures is with this\n\n1042\n00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,542\ndynamic Access control in\nthe Windows Server 2012.\n\n1043\n00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:35,240\nAnd how you can set all these\nconditions through group policy.\n\n1044\n00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,130\nAnd, I mean, really take full\ncontrol over your resources and\n\n1045\n00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:44,460\nreally fine-grained to have that\nprinciple of least privilege.\n\n1046\n00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,670\n>> Yeah, I've seen some neat ones.\n\n1047\n00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:49,200\nYou know, where you might have\na shared folder on the network and\n\n1048\n00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,950\nyou can set it where there's\neven like time restrictions and\n\n1049\n00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,270\nstuff that limit when people\ncan get at the files and all.\n\n1050\n00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,650\nIt's really pretty cool.\n\n1051\n00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,770\nSo, definitely a neat new feature.\n\n1052\n00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:01,385\nAnd being new, that increases the\nlikelihood of it showing up on the exam.\n\n1053\n00:53:01,385 --> 00:53:03,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1054\n00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,580\nAll right so yep now, oh that's right.\n\n1055\n00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,100\nYeah cuz we came from inherited\npermissions and what not.\n\n1056\n00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,830\nDo we have anything more to do on that?\n\n1057\n00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:16,500\n>> Yeah so I want to talk a little bit\nmore on how the permissions intermingle.\n\n1058\n00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,310\nSo that we can kind of see how we might\nkind of set that up in an environment.\n\n1059\n00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,360\nWhat would be a typical like\nreal world deployment of this?\n\n1060\n00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,320\nSo I want to talk a little\nbit more about that.\n\n1061\n00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:30,230\nWe also have the matter of, like, what\nhappens when we copy or move files, right?\n\n1062\n00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:31,700\nIsn't that in our objectives?\n\n1063\n00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,170\n>> Yeah, sort of, oh, yes.\n\n1064\n00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:37,710\nYeah, it's in there,\nI think towards the bottom.\n\n1065\n00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:40,410\nSo I want to talk those\npermission intermingle, oh,\n\n1066\n00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:42,440\nespecially with share permissions,\nI didn't even think about that,\n\n1067\n00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,530\nso we have those still too, so\nwe got several things to tackle.\n\n1068\n00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,240\nThere's only a few minutes left\nbefore the break though so.\n\n1069\n00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,710\n>> You know what, let's briefly,\nyeah because we do have a little bit,\n\n1070\n00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,090\nlet's just briefly talk about privileges.\n\n1071\n00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:54,653\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> And\n\n1072\n00:53:54,653 --> 00:53:57,260\nhow privileges can override permissions.\n\n1073\n00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,040\nSo you know, earlier you had\nmentioned that the administrator\n\n1074\n00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,450\ngroup can seize ownership of\nthat whole take ownership thing.\n\n1075\n00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:11,250\nSo if a user does not have those\nexplicit permissions over a file or\n\n1076\n00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,300\na folder, if they're not on the list,\nso they should be implicitly denied,\n\n1077\n00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,350\nif that user is a member of\nthe administrators group.\n\n1078\n00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:22,240\nSo this user has that privilege,\nthen they can go in there and\n\n1079\n00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,790\nseize ownership and\nhave their way with that file.\n\n1080\n00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,640\n>> Sounds so dirty when you say that.\n\n1081\n00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,770\nSo privileges, they're invisible, right.\n\n1082\n00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,820\nYou don't see them, you can't change them,\nthey're built into the system.\n\n1083\n00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,350\nIt's part of what Microsoft\nwrote into Windows.\n\n1084\n00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:42,680\nBut very powerful, very useful, and\nit's the key to those special groups.\n\n1085\n00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,250\nSo if I take that marketing folder\nthat I created earlier, and\n\n1086\n00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:49,970\nI'm going to go into the permissions here,\nand I'm just going to remove everything.\n\n1087\n00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:50,900\nAnd, oh shoot.\n\n1088\n00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,910\nI got to block inheritance first.\n\n1089\n00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:55,850\nSo, let me, it's a good thing we\njust learned how to do that, right?\n\n1090\n00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:56,950\nSo let me just remove everything.\n\n1091\n00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,040\nWhoops.\n\n1092\n00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,300\nDaggumit, I'm just going crazy today.\n\n1093\n00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,270\nSo let's go ahead and\nset this, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1094\n00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,940\nSo it's warning me that I'm\ndenying everybody, right?\n\n1095\n00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,720\nThat I just removed everything so\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n1096\n00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,670\njust say okay to that now.\n\n1097\n00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,590\nI'm still the owner of that file so\nowners have special privileges too.\n\n1098\n00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:19,550\nBut now that I'm not in that list, right,\nif I double-click on it, what do I get?\n\n1099\n00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,895\nYou don't currently have\npermission to access this folder,\n\n1100\n00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:23,595\nI can't get at it, right?\n\n1101\n00:55:23,595 --> 00:55:28,675\nWell as an administrator, I have\nthe ability to override those permissions,\n\n1102\n00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:32,935\nand see what it says, click continue to\npermanently get access to this folder.\n\n1103\n00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:36,050\nWhat it's gonna say is forget\nthe permissions that are on there.\n\n1104\n00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:39,660\nWe're just going to delete those and\nreplace them with permissions that allow\n\n1105\n00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:44,010\nyou to access it so you can effectively\noverride what's done on the file.\n\n1106\n00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,920\nThat's a privilege that this user has.\n\n1107\n00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,470\nNow, don't confuse that with a right.\n\n1108\n00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,780\nWe talked about rights in 687, didn't we.\n\n1109\n00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,830\n>> Yes.\n\n1110\n00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,110\nSort of.\nKind of, not really.\n\n1111\n00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:54,780\n>> Okay.\n\n1112\n00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,610\n>> Nothing really in depth.\n\n1113\n00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,960\n>> Just, real quick for them here because\nthey probably show up somewhere else.\n\n1114\n00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,340\nUsers have rights as well as privileges\nand it gets really confusing.\n\n1115\n00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,758\nSo a privilege or a permission,\n\n1116\n00:56:05,758 --> 00:56:11,501\nthose apply to accessing actual resources,\nfiles, folders, printers.\n\n1117\n00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:12,221\nAll right.\n\n1118\n00:56:12,221 --> 00:56:19,530\nBut a right, that applies, and right is\nR I G H T, right like the Bill of Rights.\n\n1119\n00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,470\nSo, which I guess makes sense for\nour American viewers,\n\n1120\n00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:22,435\neverybody else who knows.\n\n1121\n00:56:22,435 --> 00:56:23,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1122\n00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:27,285\nso for for a right that's your\nability to perform an action.\n\n1123\n00:56:27,285 --> 00:56:29,165\nNot necessarily tied to a file or folder.\n\n1124\n00:56:29,165 --> 00:56:34,845\nSo, administrators have the right to\nchange the system clock on a computer.\n\n1125\n00:56:34,845 --> 00:56:37,385\nAnd they have the right to\nshut the computer down.\n\n1126\n00:56:37,385 --> 00:56:41,775\nA regular user also has the right\nto shut the computer down.\n\n1127\n00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:43,635\nIt's not a file or\na folder that's involved.\n\n1128\n00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:48,315\nPermissions are what we generally assign\nto files, folders, and printers for\n\n1129\n00:56:48,315 --> 00:56:49,510\nnormal access.\n\n1130\n00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:54,210\nBut then a privilege is something\nthat overrides that access.\n\n1131\n00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,170\nLet me add that to the notes\nthat we've been whipping up for\n\n1132\n00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:02,030\nthis show, cuz it is confusing and\nthere are very similar terms.\n\n1133\n00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,460\nSo, I'm just going to go down\nhere to the end of this and\n\n1134\n00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:13,140\nI'm just going to add that because\nyou have permissions, privileges.\n\n1135\n00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,470\nWhich I'm spelling wrong, right?\n\n1136\n00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,630\n>> You know there's a D in there?\n\n1137\n00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,260\n>> Nope, that's not even right.\n\n1138\n00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,345\nPrivileges.\n\n1139\n00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:22,440\n[LAUGH] This is terrible, well all right,\n\n1140\n00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,570\nit just shows the state of\nour public education system.\n\n1141\n00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:29,030\nSo privileges and then rights.\n\n1142\n00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,530\nOkay.\n\n1143\n00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:39,701\nSo the user's ability to\naccess a file/folder/printer.\n\n1144\n00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:44,640\nA privilege is the user, or\nmore commonly a group, right, but\n\n1145\n00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,190\nwe'll just say the user.\n\n1146\n00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:50,748\nActually we'll just say special\n\n1147\n00:57:50,748 --> 00:57:56,860\npermissions that override\nexplicit permissions.\n\n1148\n00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:01,670\nSo that overrides the permissions that\nwe explicitly set on files and folders.\n\n1149\n00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:09,738\nAnd then writes a user's ability\nto perform certain actions.\n\n1150\n00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:12,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1151\n00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,780\nNow, with those privileges,\nthere is a little catch.\n\n1152\n00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,230\nThere is a little gotcha.\n\n1153\n00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:19,140\n>> No way.\n>> And all that.\n\n1154\n00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,930\nYes way.\n>> You mean something in Microsoft in not\n\n1155\n00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,255\nclear cut and well defined?\n\n1156\n00:58:22,255 --> 00:58:24,894\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if a file or\n\n1157\n00:58:24,894 --> 00:58:30,613\na folder is encrypted with\nEFS that is a stop all.\n\n1158\n00:58:30,613 --> 00:58:36,321\nYou can't seize ownership of\nsomething that is encrypted with EFS.\n\n1159\n00:58:36,321 --> 00:58:38,980\nSo yeah, the buck stops there.\n\n1160\n00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,000\n>> Well,\nunless you have your recovery key, right.\n\n1161\n00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,267\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n1162\n00:58:42,267 --> 00:58:43,373\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Or\n\n1163\n00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:45,260\nexcept there's exceptions\nto the exception.\n\n1164\n00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,750\nSo it does become a slippery slope, right.\n\n1165\n00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,220\nThere's a lot of variation there.\n\n1166\n00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,030\nBut, just remember,\nthere are these privileges that allow us.\n\n1167\n00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,310\nSo if you're an administrator you really\ncan't get locked out of a system.\n\n1168\n00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,440\nIt's really impossible.\n\n1169\n00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,560\nYou can get annoyingly delayed but\nnot locked out, so.\n\n1170\n00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,430\nAll right well Nate, let's stop here.\n\n1171\n00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,290\nLet's take a break.\n\n1172\n00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,517\nWhen we get back, I want to talk about how\nthese permissions interact with each other\n\n1173\n00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:11,968\nand kind of what happens when we\ncombine our matter and antimatter and\n\n1174\n00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:14,580\nall that and-\n>> Divide by zero.\n\n1175\n00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,390\n>> Absolutely, it will bring some\nimaginary numbers and it will be awesome.\n\n1176\n00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,858\n>> Sweet.\n>> All right, so ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1177\n00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:20,946\nstay tuned\n>> We'll be back after this.\n\n1178\n00:59:20,946 --> 00:59:29,322\n[MUSIC]\n\n1179\n00:59:29,322 --> 00:59:31,090\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n1180\n00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:33,270\nSo now we're going dive\nback into permissions and\n\n1181\n00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:37,250\nwhat we're going to take a look at this\ntime is some interesting behavior that\n\n1182\n00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,480\npermissions have when\nworking with our files.\n\n1183\n00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,750\nWe already talked about inheritance and\n\n1184\n00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,620\nhow when you create a new file or\na new folder\n\n1185\n00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,090\nit's gonna inherit the permissions of\nthe folder that it was created inside of.\n\n1186\n00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,730\nIts parent object.\n\n1187\n00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,050\nThat's what they do.\n\n1188\n00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:54,740\nBut there's also some weird\nbehavior when we copy or\n\n1189\n00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:58,140\nmove a file from one location to another.\n\n1190\n00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:05,310\nAnd let's start off with just a raw\nlist of kind of what happens.\n\n1191\n01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,080\nAnd here, I'll add it.\n\n1192\n01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,605\nWhat happens when I copy or\nmove something, right?\n\n1193\n01:00:12,605 --> 01:00:14,815\nSo what the heck happens, right?\n\n1194\n01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:19,405\nSo, there's really four\ndifferent scenarios that we can\n\n1195\n01:00:19,405 --> 01:00:22,075\nhave when it comes to copying and moving.\n\n1196\n01:00:22,075 --> 01:00:27,150\nWe can copy from one\ndrive letter to another.\n\n1197\n01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:34,050\nWe can move from one\ndrive letter to another.\n\n1198\n01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,760\n>> So like volumes.\n\n1199\n01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,890\n>> Yeah so if you have a C drive and\na D drive.\n\n1200\n01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:44,697\nRight.\nSo, I guess if I wanted to do an example.\n\n1201\n01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:50,940\nThere.\n\n1202\n01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:56,390\nSo if I'm copying something\nfrom C:/test.txt to D: right,\n\n1203\n01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:00,610\nand I can do the same thing but\nwith a move instead right.\n\n1204\n01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:06,170\nSo those two scenarios involve\ngoing between drive letters,\n\n1205\n01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:10,040\nand we've also got where\nwe could just kinda\n\n1206\n01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:16,590\ntake those same things and\napply them within the same drive letter.\n\n1207\n01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:21,204\nRight, so I can say I copy I\nguess I would be copying between\n\n1208\n01:01:21,204 --> 01:01:23,946\nfolders on the same drive letter.\n\n1209\n01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:39,921\n>> So\nthat would be like copy C:\\folder1\\test\n\n1210\n01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:44,010\nto c:\\folder2\\test.\n\n1211\n01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,920\nAll right.\n\n1212\n01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,360\nLet me update this last one and\nthose will be our four scenarios.\n\n1213\n01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,830\n>> All right, so yeah,\nwe'll start with copy first.\n\n1214\n01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:04,405\nSo when we copy something and so\nlet's see we're on the on the same drive.\n\n1215\n01:02:04,405 --> 01:02:08,456\nSo when you copy something a folder or\n\n1216\n01:02:08,456 --> 01:02:15,382\na file to another location on\nthe same drive, the same volume,\n\n1217\n01:02:15,382 --> 01:02:21,550\nthe permissions are inherited\nfrom the target folder.\n\n1218\n01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:25,655\nAnd the any explicit permissions are lost.\n\n1219\n01:02:25,655 --> 01:02:29,021\nAll right so\nyou're copying it over there and\n\n1220\n01:02:29,021 --> 01:02:32,330\nbasically I mean you're making a new file.\n\n1221\n01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:36,720\nSo it It has the same data as the old\nfile that you're coming from but\n\n1222\n01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:42,420\nbecause you're making a new file it's\ngoing to inherit the target folder,\n\n1223\n01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,740\nthe properties from that.\n\n1224\n01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:49,220\nAnd anything that you explicitly\nset on the old one, those are gone.\n\n1225\n01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,860\n>> Yep, and\nthat's true of any copy operation.\n\n1226\n01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,790\nSo whether we're copying between\nfolders on the same drive, or\n\n1227\n01:02:55,790 --> 01:03:01,080\nif we're copying between\nfolders on a different drive,\n\n1228\n01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,840\nwhich actually I guess I could\nmaybe change the order of this.\n\n1229\n01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,730\nOh, that worked out perfect, didn't it?\n\n1230\n01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,614\nLet me change,\nI'm gonna put the copies together.\n\n1231\n01:03:10,946 --> 01:03:11,880\nThere.\n\n1232\n01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,400\nSo if we copy between\nfolders on the same drive.\n\n1233\n01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,310\nWhen you copy it, it duplicating a file,\nit's creating a all new copy of that file,\n\n1234\n01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:19,850\nso it gets all new permissions.\n\n1235\n01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:22,470\nWhen you copy it from one drive\nletter to another, same thing.\n\n1236\n01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:24,470\nCreating a duplicate, just like Nate said.\n\n1237\n01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,510\nAnd getting all new permissions.\n\n1238\n01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,090\nSo those really do function the same.\n\n1239\n01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:30,700\n>> Yup.\nNow,\n\n1240\n01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,210\nand in moving a file is sort of the same.\n\n1241\n01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:38,190\nWhen you move a file over on the same\n\n1242\n01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:45,500\nvolume, the permissions are inherited\nfrom that target folder.\n\n1243\n01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,600\nHowever, any explicit\npermissions are kept.\n\n1244\n01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,203\nSo those come along.\n\n1245\n01:03:50,203 --> 01:03:51,759\n>> Are you sure?\n\n1246\n01:03:51,759 --> 01:03:52,536\n>> M-hm.\n\n1247\n01:03:52,536 --> 01:03:53,946\nYeah.\n>> Because I'm pretty sure you're wrong.\n\n1248\n01:03:53,946 --> 01:03:56,450\n>> Oh.\nAll right.\n\n1249\n01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:59,314\nOkay, tough guy.\n>> Moves are the really tricky ones.\n\n1250\n01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:01,659\nMoves are a bizarre thing.\n\n1251\n01:04:01,659 --> 01:04:06,175\nLet me draw a picture so I make sure\nthat I'm on the same page as you.\n\n1252\n01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:09,112\nSo, let me just kinda fire this up here.\n\n1253\n01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:13,061\nWhen we copy, remember what Nate\nsaid about how when you copy,\n\n1254\n01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:17,540\nyou're creating an all new file,\na duplicate of that first file.\n\n1255\n01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:21,080\nSo, there's now two\ncopies of the same file.\n\n1256\n01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,878\nAnd so, if you think of that, I'm gonna\ndraw I'm going to draw two hard drives.\n\n1257\n01:04:23,878 --> 01:04:24,940\nThis is my favorite drawing.\n\n1258\n01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,000\nIt's the only time I get\nto draw boobs on the show.\n\n1259\n01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,240\n>> And, I love this one.\n\n1260\n01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,490\n>> And, people tune in while I'm doing\nthis and is like, why is he drawing boobs?\n\n1261\n01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,350\nIt's to learn.\n\n1262\n01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:34,510\nIts education.\n\n1263\n01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:37,900\nSo, let me just draw boobs.\n\n1264\n01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,938\nSo anyhow, these are hard drives, right?\n\n1265\n01:04:39,938 --> 01:04:41,250\nNot boobs.\n\n1266\n01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:47,450\nWhen you write a file to a hard drive,\nyou got a couple of pieces to that file.\n\n1267\n01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,930\nYou got the file data itself,\nthat gets written out and\n\n1268\n01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,748\nabout somewhere on the drive.\n\n1269\n01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:57,370\nAnd then, you've got the actual NTFS table\n\n1270\n01:04:57,370 --> 01:05:01,405\ndata that actually identifies the files\nname, and the permissions, and stuff.\n\n1271\n01:05:01,405 --> 01:05:04,275\nAnd, that's normally stored here,\nkind of in the inside of the drive.\n\n1272\n01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,035\nLet me do that in red.\n\n1273\n01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:06,255\nSo, it's just kinda marked different.\n\n1274\n01:05:06,255 --> 01:05:07,315\nAll right?\n\n1275\n01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:12,165\n>> When you copy a file,\nif I'm copying to a new hard drive.\n\n1276\n01:05:12,165 --> 01:05:15,886\nSo, if this is my C drive, and\nI'm copying to my D drive,\n\n1277\n01:05:15,886 --> 01:05:19,777\nit's gotta take that data,\nit's gotta copy it over here.\n\n1278\n01:05:19,777 --> 01:05:23,010\nAnd, it's gotta create an all\nnew NTFS entry, right?\n\n1279\n01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,970\nSo, it's copying it over.\n\n1280\n01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:29,600\nAnd so, when that happens, it's all new,\nit gets all new permissions.\n\n1281\n01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,890\nInherits the permissions\nto the destination.\n\n1282\n01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:35,830\nWhen you copy it within a single drive,\n\n1283\n01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,690\nthe data itself has to get duplicated,\nyou're making a second copy.\n\n1284\n01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:44,785\nSo, a second copy of that data is written,\n\n1285\n01:05:44,785 --> 01:05:48,440\nand a second entry is made in the NTFS\ntable identifying that second file.\n\n1286\n01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,096\nSo, it's a duplicate,\neither way it's a duplicate.\n\n1287\n01:05:50,096 --> 01:05:54,730\nWhen you move between drives, so\n\n1288\n01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:59,390\nif I move a file from the first drive\nto the other one, unlike a copy,\n\n1289\n01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:02,710\nwhen you move,\nthe original is removed, it's deleted.\n\n1290\n01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:03,710\nIt's gone.\n\n1291\n01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:09,720\nSo, when I move between two drives,\nif I've got my original file over here,\n\n1292\n01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:15,200\nit copies the data, it creates an entry\n\n1293\n01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:20,690\nhere, and\nthen it removes the original file.\n\n1294\n01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:21,985\nRight?\nSo, the original file goes away.\n\n1295\n01:06:21,985 --> 01:06:24,080\nThat's the point of a move.\n\n1296\n01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,260\nAnd, because this is an all-new file over\nhere, it is getting all new permissions.\n\n1297\n01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,440\nAll right?\n\n1298\n01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,576\nThe one that's weird, so\n\n1299\n01:06:30,576 --> 01:06:33,944\nfar the three scenarios that I've\ncovered have all been identical, right?\n\n1300\n01:06:33,944 --> 01:06:39,453\nSo, that was moving between drives.\n\n1301\n01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:39,976\nThere.\n\n1302\n01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:46,060\nOkay so,\nlet me just rearrange these, there.\n\n1303\n01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:48,240\nSo, those first three\nscenarios are all identical.\n\n1304\n01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,580\nThe one that's weird,\nthe one where things get different,\n\n1305\n01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,680\nis what if I move between\nfolders on the same drive?\n\n1306\n01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,420\nHere's where things are odd.\n\n1307\n01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:00,550\nWhen I move between folders\non this same drive,\n\n1308\n01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:05,740\nI'm moving it, so\nit doesn't have to copy this data.\n\n1309\n01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:10,610\nAll it has to do is go to this pointer,\nedit that pointer and\n\n1310\n01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:15,410\nsay, instead of being in folder one,\nyou're now in folder two.\n\n1311\n01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:18,030\nSo the file, itself, is not duplicated.\n\n1312\n01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:19,870\nA new file is not created.\n\n1313\n01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,670\nThe old file is not deleted.\n\n1314\n01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,290\nJust the pointer has changed.\n\n1315\n01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:27,870\nAnd, because the pointer gets changed,\nits permissions get retained.\n\n1316\n01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:28,390\nAll right?\n\n1317\n01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:29,820\nNow Nate, that's what you were saying,\n\n1318\n01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:34,570\nyou were saying they were getting retained\nas far as the explicit permissions.\n\n1319\n01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:37,430\nBut then, you were saying that\nthe implicit permissions were changing,\n\n1320\n01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,200\nand I didn't think that was the case.\n\n1321\n01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,220\nBut, it's real easy to test.\n\n1322\n01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,560\nSo, we can test it out, and figure it out.\n\n1323\n01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,040\nI was pretty certain that even\nthe implicit permissions were retained,\n\n1324\n01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,070\nthat they inherited.\n\n1325\n01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,410\nSo, let's find that out.\n\n1326\n01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:52,850\nWe'll do an experiment, and\nwe'll find out right here.\n\n1327\n01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:53,810\nAll right.\n\n1328\n01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:54,650\n>> All right.\n\n1329\n01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:59,878\n>> So, I'm gonna create two folders,\n\n1330\n01:07:59,878 --> 01:08:03,456\nFolder1 and Folder2.\n\n1331\n01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:06,563\nAnd, I'm gonna block\ninheritance on both of them, so\n\n1332\n01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:09,003\nthat I can assign permissions that I want.\n\n1333\n01:08:09,003 --> 01:08:13,354\nSo, on Folder1 here,\nI'll just Edit, and, oops, no,\n\n1334\n01:08:13,354 --> 01:08:18,054\nI need to go into Advanced,\nI'm going to Disable inheritance,\n\n1335\n01:08:18,054 --> 01:08:23,206\nRemove all, and I'm gonna Add,\nlet's do Everyone, Full control.\n\n1336\n01:08:30,213 --> 01:08:31,974\nOkay.\nSo, on this folder,\n\n1337\n01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,460\neveryone has full control.\n\n1338\n01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,530\nOkay?\n\n1339\n01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:39,730\nOn Folder2,\n>> Everyone has read.\n\n1340\n01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:44,370\n>> That's gonna make it hard for\nme to write to the folder.\n\n1341\n01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,770\nLet's do domain users have full control.\n\n1342\n01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:47,570\nHow about that?\n\n1343\n01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:48,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n1344\n01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:54,670\n>> Trying not to make it\nharder than we have to.\n\n1345\n01:08:56,290 --> 01:08:59,150\nAll right, so\nwe'll do domain users full control.\n\n1346\n01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:02,596\nOkay, so now, just a recap, Folder1,\n\n1347\n01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:07,625\neveryone has full control,\nFolder2, just domain users.\n\n1348\n01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:08,945\nThis is a domain machine, so\n\n1349\n01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:11,705\nthat means I'm gonna have full\ncontrol of both these folders.\n\n1350\n01:09:11,705 --> 01:09:14,805\nI'm gonna go into Folder1, and\nI'm gonna create a new file.\n\n1351\n01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:19,030\nSo, I'll say new, text file, Nate.\n\n1352\n01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,150\nI can't even spell your name.\n\n1353\n01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:22,510\nNate's passwords.\n\n1354\n01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,960\nOkay.\n\n1355\n01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,780\nAll right.\n\n1356\n01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,390\nAnd, I'm going to go into\nthe permissions here.\n\n1357\n01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:30,400\nAnd, it's inheriting.\n\n1358\n01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,970\nSee how it's inheriting everyone?\n\n1359\n01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:33,690\nSo, I can't change that.\n\n1360\n01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:34,930\nAnd I'm gonna add Nate.\n\n1361\n01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:40,770\nSince they're your passwords,\nI might as well give you full control.\n\n1362\n01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:44,030\nAnd, then I'll add me, because I can.\n\n1363\n01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:47,575\nAnd, I'll just give me read access.\n\n1364\n01:09:47,575 --> 01:09:48,075\n>> Okay.\n>> Okay.\n\n1365\n01:09:48,075 --> 01:09:48,671\nSo now,\n\n1366\n01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:51,669\ninherited we're getting everyone.\nSo,\n\n1367\n01:09:51,669 --> 01:09:54,740\nthose are being inherited\nfrom the folder we're in.\n\n1368\n01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,195\nAnd then explicitly, I've defined Nate and\nI to have our access.\n\n1369\n01:09:58,195 --> 01:09:58,869\nOkay.\n\n1370\n01:09:58,869 --> 01:10:01,670\nNow, if I copy this.\n\n1371\n01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,080\nAnd here,\nwe'll do a left-right folder thing.\n\n1372\n01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,520\n>> I'm using my snap, right?\n\n1373\n01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,640\n>> Yes.\n\n1374\n01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,850\n>> My name is Don Pissett and\nI am Windows 7.\n\n1375\n01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,230\n>> Worst commercials ever.\n\n1376\n01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:14,060\n>> I liked those.\n\n1377\n01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:14,640\n>> Did you?\n\n1378\n01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,470\n>> Well, sort of.\n\n1379\n01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:18,510\n>> Well yeah,\nsomeone had to like them I guess.\n\n1380\n01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:20,380\n>> I don't know, witty.\n\n1381\n01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:22,580\nWhere did I create that folder?\n\n1382\n01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,406\nOh, right off the local drive.\n\n1383\n01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:28,382\nC: and there we go.\n\n1384\n01:10:28,382 --> 01:10:34,090\nSo, on the left,\nthat folder has everyone full control.\n\n1385\n01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:38,505\nOn the right, this folder has\njust domain users full control.\n\n1386\n01:10:38,505 --> 01:10:41,935\n>> So, I'm copying Nate's passwords,\nand pasting it.\n\n1387\n01:10:41,935 --> 01:10:46,285\nNow, both of us agreed here,\nwhen you do a copy, it's an all new file.\n\n1388\n01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:48,005\nThe explicit permissions go away.\n\n1389\n01:10:48,005 --> 01:10:50,145\nWe inherit the permissions\nof our destination.\n\n1390\n01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,715\nThis one should have domain\nusers full control, right?\n\n1391\n01:10:53,715 --> 01:10:58,525\nSo, I'm gonna pull up the properties\nof that file, and go to security, and\n\n1392\n01:10:58,525 --> 01:11:01,355\nsure enough,\ndomain users have full control.\n\n1393\n01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,170\nEverything else is gone.\n\n1394\n01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,240\nSo, we're in full agreement\n>> Yes\n\n1395\n01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,920\n>> Where we disagreed was on the move.\n\n1396\n01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,340\nSo, let's see what happens with the move.\n\n1397\n01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:12,237\nSo, this time I'm going to right click,\nand I'm going to do a cut, right?\n\n1398\n01:11:12,237 --> 01:11:16,422\nSo, cut and paste is the same as a move,\nso I'll cut and paste.\n\n1399\n01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:18,670\nThis is the moment of truth.\n\n1400\n01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:19,746\n>> Right?\nAre you getting nervous?\n\n1401\n01:11:19,746 --> 01:11:26,346\n>> No, it's gonna have a domain,\nusers, and then me and you in there.\n\n1402\n01:11:26,346 --> 01:11:28,018\n>> Okay, so we've moved it.\n\n1403\n01:11:28,018 --> 01:11:29,661\nNow, when we move it, Nate and\n\n1404\n01:11:29,661 --> 01:11:32,958\nI were both in agreement that\nthe explicit permissions stay.\n\n1405\n01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:37,932\nCuz, the file didn't actually change,\njust the pointer changed, right?\n\n1406\n01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:42,720\nBut, I'm saying that it'll still\nhave everyone full control.\n\n1407\n01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,940\nYou're saying that it will have\ndomain users full control.\n\n1408\n01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:45,450\n>> Yes.\n\n1409\n01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:49,337\n>> Let's see who's right, moment of truth.\n\n1410\n01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:50,637\n>> Oh, my goodness.\n\n1411\n01:11:50,637 --> 01:11:52,000\n>> Oh., you are right.\nOkay.\n\n1412\n01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,038\nSo, notice how the explicit\npermissions came over.\n\n1413\n01:11:55,038 --> 01:12:00,043\nIt still has me, and it has Nate, and\nthat's because the file itself wasn't\n\n1414\n01:12:00,043 --> 01:12:05,050\nchanged, but the inherited permissions\ndid update to reflect this folder.\n\n1415\n01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:07,129\nSo it does right on there.\n\n1416\n01:12:07,129 --> 01:12:10,470\nNow that begs the question, because\nthat's not how I thought it behaved.\n\n1417\n01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:11,620\nWhat if?\n\n1418\n01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,850\nSo if I'm gonna put the file back,\nall right.\n\n1419\n01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:17,860\nWhat if I had blocked\ninheritance altogether?\n\n1420\n01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:25,400\nSo on the file if I block inheritance, so\nI'm removing all inherited permissions.\n\n1421\n01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,080\nSo now there's no inherited ones on this.\n\n1422\n01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,750\nIf I cut and paste that is that\ngoing to turn on inheritance?\n\n1423\n01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,950\nI'm going to learn something today.\n\n1424\n01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:38,850\nNo, all right so blocked inheritance\nstays, even if you go across.\n\n1425\n01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,250\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1426\n01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:43,380\nSo I get to learn something new today,\nright.\n\n1427\n01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:49,090\nSo the implicit permission,\nwell I guess they're implicit.\n\n1428\n01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:52,610\nThe inherited permissions, those do change\nto the target, but the explicit ones.\n\n1429\n01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:54,670\nThe ones we manually put in there,\nthey do stay.\n\n1430\n01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,590\nSo that is different on this fourth one.\n\n1431\n01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,375\nSo let me add that here.\n\n1432\n01:13:02,055 --> 01:13:07,280\n>> And I suppose there could\nbe a fifth one, kinda sorta.\n\n1433\n01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:15,270\nIf you are copying or moving one of these\nfiles or folders to a non-NTFS drive,\n\n1434\n01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:19,750\nthen it loses all the NTFS permissions,\ncuz it's not NTFS.\n\n1435\n01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:20,890\nIt's just stripped.\n\n1436\n01:13:20,890 --> 01:13:22,050\n>> Yeah.\nExcellent point.\n\n1437\n01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:24,510\nIf it's FAT32, or\neven if it's a network share, right.\n\n1438\n01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:27,470\nWhen you, when you copy to a network\nshare the permissions get lost and\n\n1439\n01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:30,690\nthey get set to whatever's\nat that destination.\n\n1440\n01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:32,530\nSo yeah, that is another scenario.\n\n1441\n01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,330\nOr burned to a CD.\n\n1442\n01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,590\nThat's a different file system,\nyou'd lose your permissions there.\n\n1443\n01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,670\nBut, I guess that's fairly common.\n\n1444\n01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,940\nIf you copy something to a USB key.\n\n1445\n01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,610\nIf you've got a thumb drive, and\nyou format it FAT32 or XFAT or whatever,\n\n1446\n01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,960\nthen you're going to\nlose those permissions.\n\n1447\n01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,010\nBut for the exam, the ones that they want\nyou to know are these four right here.\n\n1448\n01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,840\nAnd so I wrote them out in the notes,\ncuz it is a good thing to have.\n\n1449\n01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,860\nAnd like I said,\nI'll post these with the show.\n\n1450\n01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:00,970\nBut just remember the first\nthree scenarios when we copy,\n\n1451\n01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:05,780\nany time we copy,\nright on the same drive or between drives.\n\n1452\n01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:09,990\nWhen we move between drives,\nall three of those\n\n1453\n01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:13,550\nyou completely lose your permissions and\nyou gain whatever the destination has.\n\n1454\n01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:18,310\nThe difference is when you move\nbetween folders on the same drive,\n\n1455\n01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:20,110\nmoving between folders on the same drive.\n\n1456\n01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:23,810\nYou will retain your explicit permissions,\nright?\n\n1457\n01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:26,212\nSo I'm gonna add,\nI'm gonna spice this up a little bit.\n\n1458\n01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:30,299\nWe're gonna add some asterisks in here, so\nthat we can notice how special that is.\n\n1459\n01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,376\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that is a big deal.\n\n1460\n01:14:33,376 --> 01:14:35,150\nI do wanna make one other point.\n\n1461\n01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:41,250\nIf you have one physical hard drive,\nand you create two volumes on it.\n\n1462\n01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,230\nSo maybe you partition your drive,\nyou have a C and a D drive.\n\n1463\n01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:49,550\nWell, that would me moving between\nfolders on a different drive, right?\n\n1464\n01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:50,740\nEven though it's the same physical drive.\n\n1465\n01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:54,435\nSo we're talking about logical drives\nhere, not physical drives, okay?\n\n1466\n01:14:54,435 --> 01:14:55,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1467\n01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,220\n>> Although it holds\ntrue on physical drives.\n\n1468\n01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,560\nSo if you have multiple partitions,\n\n1469\n01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,895\nthe permissions treat those\nas separate actual drives.\n\n1470\n01:15:01,895 --> 01:15:03,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1471\n01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,790\nAll right, yeah.\n\n1472\n01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:08,070\nAgain I should have liked bargained or\nsomething,\n\n1473\n01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,970\nbecause I started losing\na little bit of confidence.\n\n1474\n01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:12,090\nYou'd like oh really Nate?\n\n1475\n01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:12,755\n>> Are you sure?\n\n1476\n01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:14,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> I don't know, I don't know.\n\n1477\n01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,830\n>> I'll say it for the camera,\nyou were right I was wrong, absolutely.\n\n1478\n01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,310\n>> Jason you'll have to sample that.\n\n1479\n01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:22,240\n>> You were right.\n\n1480\n01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,375\nI was less correct, how about that?\n\n1481\n01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:29,380\n[LAUGH]\n>> Way to dilute my victory, but\n\n1482\n01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,350\nI'll take what I can.\n\n1483\n01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:34,000\n>> [LAUGH] All right so\njust remember though that fourth\n\n1484\n01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,830\nscenario is different and\nthey love to throw that one on the test.\n\n1485\n01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,490\nBecause it's a hard one to remember.\n\n1486\n01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:41,600\nJust when you move within\nthe same drive letter\n\n1487\n01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,745\nsome of your permissions get rescinded.\n\n1488\n01:15:42,745 --> 01:15:44,560\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right so\n\n1489\n01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,438\nwe do have another thing coming up.\n\n1490\n01:15:47,438 --> 01:15:54,260\nI guess our next little point that is\ncombining NTFS and share permissions.\n\n1491\n01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:57,845\nNow Donald, so you and\nI have covered share permissions earlier.\n\n1492\n01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And we didn't really touch so\n\n1493\n01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:03,360\nmuch on, of course,\nNTFS cuz we saved it for this one.\n\n1494\n01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:09,030\nSo when we have NTFS and\nshare permissions, right.\n\n1495\n01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,610\nCombining those two or\naccessing something over the network,\n\n1496\n01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:15,560\nit does kind of change things, right.\n\n1497\n01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> P access.\n\n1498\n01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,260\n>> All the permissions we've set so\nfar, NTSF, permissions.\n\n1499\n01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:21,660\nThey're local permission\nthey're on the hard drive.\n\n1500\n01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,770\nThey apply whether you're\nsitting at the computer or\n\n1501\n01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:26,480\nwhether you're coming in over the network.\n\n1502\n01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,440\nRight?\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1503\n01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,880\n>> But share permissions, those only apply\nwhen somebody comes in over the network.\n\n1504\n01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,580\nThey're a different type of permission.\n\n1505\n01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:38,460\nAnd they have to intermingle\nwith the NTFS permissions.\n\n1506\n01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,140\nThey work together, right?\n\n1507\n01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:43,290\nSo we need to be aware of that,\nand how they mix together.\n\n1508\n01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:46,780\nAnd kinda what happens when\nthat access occurs, right?\n\n1509\n01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,310\nSo let's talk about that.\n\n1510\n01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,660\nAnd I think we did mention it\nbriefly in the other show.\n\n1511\n01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,920\nBut let's just kind of examine it here.\n\n1512\n01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,250\nLet me get back to my little\nshared folder diagram, this one.\n\n1513\n01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,370\nOkay, so this diagram that\nI made is kind of a mess.\n\n1514\n01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:04,365\nAnd it was really just all based\non NTFS permissions, right?\n\n1515\n01:17:04,365 --> 01:17:07,720\nSo let's clean this up a bit.\n\n1516\n01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,040\nApparently I've lost my undo function.\n\n1517\n01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:13,680\nThat would be crazy if I could undo.\n\n1518\n01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,790\nSo if I set permissions at the NTFS level,\n\n1519\n01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,800\nI mentioned earlier how\nthose permissions combined.\n\n1520\n01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,580\nIf I'm in the marketing group and\n\n1521\n01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,635\nthe sales group,\nI get the benefit of both groups.\n\n1522\n01:17:25,635 --> 01:17:29,480\nWhen we're dealing with multiple groups\nin NTFS, you get the best of both worlds.\n\n1523\n01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:34,080\nYou combine all your permissions to\ncreate a super set of permissions.\n\n1524\n01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,090\nActually, here's something good we\ncan talk about before the break.\n\n1525\n01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,820\nIf we're combining all these to\nget the best possible permissions,\n\n1526\n01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,730\nhow do I know what my permissions\nare actually going to be?\n\n1527\n01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:44,730\nRight?\n\n1528\n01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:47,870\nThe permissions that you get\ndon't necessarily match up with\n\n1529\n01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,050\none group or another.\n\n1530\n01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,910\nIf I'm in sales and marketing,\n\n1531\n01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:56,160\nthe permissions I actually end up with are\nwhat are called my effective permissions.\n\n1532\n01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,920\nThe effective permissions\nare what you actually get.\n\n1533\n01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,980\nSo, if I'm a domain admin and\nI'm in sales, and\n\n1534\n01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:07,050\nI'm in marketing, those roll up\ninto my effective permissions.\n\n1535\n01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,790\nAnd we can't see what those are.\n\n1536\n01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:12,050\nWhen we look at the permissions\nscreen of the Sales folder,\n\n1537\n01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:14,960\nI don't know what people's\neffective permissions are gonna be.\n\n1538\n01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,665\nBut Microsoft has a tool for that right?\n\n1539\n01:18:16,665 --> 01:18:17,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So let's took a look at\n\n1540\n01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:19,425\nthat before we dive into the shared stuff.\n\n1541\n01:18:19,425 --> 01:18:20,460\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n1542\n01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:25,561\nAll right yeah so\nbrowsing into the properties\n\n1543\n01:18:25,561 --> 01:18:30,150\nof a file or a folder and\nthe security tab.\n\n1544\n01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:32,280\nSecurity tab.\n\n1545\n01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,504\n>> Stand up slow.\n>> Oh no, so in the advanced,\n\n1546\n01:18:35,504 --> 01:18:39,163\nall right go ahead and so the tab.\n\n1547\n01:18:39,163 --> 01:18:40,010\nThere's the tab up there.\n\n1548\n01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,032\nAt the top there.\n\n1549\n01:18:41,032 --> 01:18:43,285\nWhatever just going to go full string.\n\n1550\n01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:44,271\nFine.\n\n1551\n01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:48,660\nWe have a tab up there and\nit's called Effective Access.\n\n1552\n01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,230\nRight.\nClick on that guy and\n\n1553\n01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:56,900\nbrings us to the screen where we\ncan select a person or a group.\n\n1554\n01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:02,260\nAnd it will tell us all the permissions or\n\n1555\n01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:06,580\nwhat it really has over that\nparticular item that we clicked on.\n\n1556\n01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,480\n>> And this is really handy if\nyou're using those conditions we\n\n1557\n01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,320\ntalked about earlier.\n\n1558\n01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,060\nCuz it takes those into account too.\n\n1559\n01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,770\nSo I'm picking my user or\ngroup, I'm picking me, Don.\n\n1560\n01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:17,960\nRight, and then the device.\n\n1561\n01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,630\nThe computer that I'm actually sitting at.\n\n1562\n01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,120\nI might need to come in and\npick which computer I'm sitting at, so\n\n1563\n01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,400\nthat it knows based on what\nconditions might be set.\n\n1564\n01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,110\nSo I'll say that I'm sitting\nat ITproTV client two.\n\n1565\n01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:37,690\nAnd so I can tell it, hey, if Don Pezete\nis sitting at ITproTV client two,\n\n1566\n01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:41,960\nand he tries to access this file\nwhat are his effective permissions?\n\n1567\n01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,960\nI can hit that and view effective access.\n\n1568\n01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,000\nAnd it is going to show me\nwhat I am going to get.\n\n1569\n01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,240\nI am not going to have full control.\n\n1570\n01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:51,570\nI am not going to have create,\nor write, or delete.\n\n1571\n01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:54,095\nBut, I am going to have read and traverse.\n\n1572\n01:19:54,095 --> 01:19:56,150\nRight?\nSo here is the effective permissions.\n\n1573\n01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:57,451\nWhat I end up with.\n\n1574\n01:19:57,451 --> 01:20:00,261\nAnd it can't just show us this by default,\nit has to calculate it.\n\n1575\n01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:04,058\nIt has to say all right well\nwhat groups is Don a member of?\n\n1576\n01:20:04,058 --> 01:20:06,972\nAnd once I combine all those\npermissions what does he end up with?\n\n1577\n01:20:06,972 --> 01:20:10,220\nWell he's got marketing,\nhe's got sales, its all combined.\n\n1578\n01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,476\nHere are the effective\npermissions that user will get.\n\n1579\n01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:20,890\n>> Yeah and a fantastic resource there,\nto troubleshoot why a user or a group or\n\n1580\n01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:25,096\nsomething, that doesn't have access\nto a file or a resource of some kind.\n\n1581\n01:20:25,096 --> 01:20:28,020\nAnd you're just like, man,\nwhy can't you click on this?\n\n1582\n01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,850\nOr why can you access this resource?\n\n1583\n01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:35,125\nA great way to begin\nthe troubleshooting process.\n\n1584\n01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,180\n>> Yeah, it's got a setting over here,\nor a column over here,\n\n1585\n01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:40,950\nwhere it says access limited by.\n\n1586\n01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:43,810\nIf you're getting denied some kind\nof access, where's the problem?\n\n1587\n01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:45,680\nAnd it'll tell you, oh,\nit's the file permissions,\n\n1588\n01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:49,150\nor oh it's a condition, or whatever it is,\n\n1589\n01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:52,220\nit will list what's the cause of why\nthat person can't get that access.\n\n1590\n01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,390\nSo perfect if you've got a user,\n\n1591\n01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,510\nyou're trying to give them that access,\nand you just can't figure it out.\n\n1592\n01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,370\nYou're like,\nwhy doesn't this user have access?\n\n1593\n01:20:58,370 --> 01:20:59,850\nI gave him full control!\n\n1594\n01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:02,020\nWell, maybe there's a deny in there.\n\n1595\n01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:04,150\nA deny would override the full control.\n\n1596\n01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:06,250\nOr maybe there's a condition\non top of this, it says yeah,\n\n1597\n01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:10,270\nthey get full control, from midnight\nto 1 AM, or something like that.\n\n1598\n01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:13,650\nThere could be something crazy and\nthis helps us to kind of fine tune that.\n\n1599\n01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,340\nThe effective permissions tab,\n\n1600\n01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,920\nyou just pull up the properties\nof a file or a folder.\n\n1601\n01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,660\nYou go to the security button, and\nyou go into the advanced view.\n\n1602\n01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:24,150\nSo it's under the advanced view,\nthat you get that effective access tab.\n\n1603\n01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:24,970\nVery useful.\n\n1604\n01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:27,100\nI think they introduced that\nin Windows Vista, didn't they?\n\n1605\n01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,070\n>> I never got too deep into Vista.\n\n1606\n01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:32,080\n>> Okay, it's been there for\na couple of versions.\n\n1607\n01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,460\nIt's not a new tool, but it is there,\n\n1608\n01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:37,280\nit is useful,\ndefinitely useful in practice, too.\n\n1609\n01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,630\n>> Yeah and of course,\nthis access is just whatever that person\n\n1610\n01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:47,820\nhas over that specific file, not anything\nbroad ranging or anything like that.\n\n1611\n01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,400\nJust that one particular\nfile folder resource.\n\n1612\n01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,850\n>> Yeah, if I pull up other folders\ninside, that's kinda what i'm doing here,\n\n1613\n01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:58,530\nI'm gonna pull up like\nhere's Mike's folder.\n\n1614\n01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:03,200\nI don't have access to Mike's folder, so\nI can't read the permissions or anything.\n\n1615\n01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,050\nIf I go to effective access, oh,\nit's not gonna let me do that one either.\n\n1616\n01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:07,958\nI'm gonna have to override here.\n\n1617\n01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:09,540\nThere we go.\n\n1618\n01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:14,160\nNow I can come in here and\npull up my permissions on Mike's folder.\n\n1619\n01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:19,230\nAnd I'll say that I'm sitting\nright here on ITPROTVCL1.\n\n1620\n01:22:23,108 --> 01:22:24,268\nWe have a CL10?\n\n1621\n01:22:24,268 --> 01:22:25,322\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1622\n01:22:25,322 --> 01:22:26,645\nYes.\n>> How many machines do we have?\n\n1623\n01:22:26,645 --> 01:22:30,990\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's our branch cache client.\n\n1624\n01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:31,730\n>> Oh, the remote.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1625\n01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:32,400\n>> Okay.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1626\n01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,710\nYeah.\n\n1627\n01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:36,490\n>> I can see now,\nI've got full control of Mike's folder.\n\n1628\n01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:37,106\n>> Yeah, because you seized it.\n\n1629\n01:22:37,106 --> 01:22:38,218\n[LAUGH]\n>> Because I just seized it, yeah,\n\n1630\n01:22:38,218 --> 01:22:40,020\n[LAUGH] so Mike will love that,\n\n1631\n01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:43,030\nwhich means Mike probably doesn't\nhave access now, since I seized it.\n\n1632\n01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:46,860\nLet's, actually that's funny.\n\n1633\n01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,700\nSorry, Mike, you can't log in anymore.\n\n1634\n01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:51,640\nLet me change it to Mike\nto see if I overrode him.\n\n1635\n01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,840\nThis is the cool part,\n\n1636\n01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:56,850\ncuz you can start to see the permissions\nfrom the perspective of another user.\n\n1637\n01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:00,620\nNow if I take a look at it,\noh, Mike still has access.\n\n1638\n01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,840\nHe wouldn't be able to log in.\n\n1639\n01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,508\nNow I need to change his background.\n\n1640\n01:23:04,508 --> 01:23:06,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> Ask him.\n\n1641\n01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:09,028\n>> A little bit of a side track,\nimportant though,\n\n1642\n01:23:09,028 --> 01:23:10,841\nit is in the exam objectives, I think.\n\n1643\n01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:13,117\nAnd it can show up on the exam,\nso good to know.\n\n1644\n01:23:13,117 --> 01:23:15,943\nWe are right up on our break point,\nso let's go ahead and stop here,\n\n1645\n01:23:15,943 --> 01:23:18,722\nand when we get back we'll talk\nabout how those shared permissions\n\n1646\n01:23:18,722 --> 01:23:20,430\ninteract with those NTFS permissions.\n\n1647\n01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:21,680\nSound good?\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1648\n01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,071\n>> All right ladies and\ngentlemen stay tuned.\n\n1649\n01:23:24,071 --> 01:23:27,269\nMore permissions after this.\n\n1650\n01:23:27,269 --> 01:23:34,940\n[NOISE]\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n1651\n01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:39,540\nIn our final segment here,\nI just wanna take a bit of time to look at\n\n1652\n01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:42,565\nhow share permissions and\nNTFS permissions interact.\n\n1653\n01:23:42,565 --> 01:23:45,710\nCuz it is a weird world,\nit's easy to confuse, and\n\n1654\n01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:47,590\nit's pretty common to\nshow up on the exams.\n\n1655\n01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,576\nDefinitely good stuff to know.\n\n1656\n01:23:48,576 --> 01:23:51,920\nAnd as we design and build our\nnetworks and as we plan our shares,\n\n1657\n01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,330\nwe need to think about this process.\n\n1658\n01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:57,950\nWhat I did is, during the break,\nI cleaned up my diagram.\n\n1659\n01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,810\nLet's pull this diagram back up.\n\n1660\n01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:02,170\nAnd so I kind of modified it a bit and\n\n1661\n01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:06,750\nwhat I'm gonna do is right now I've\ngot NTFS permissions in green.\n\n1662\n01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,960\nAnd then we're gonna add some\nshare permissions to it in red, so\n\n1663\n01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,350\nwe can kinda see how things look.\n\n1664\n01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:15,440\nNow as it's done right now,\nI modified what's there, so\n\n1665\n01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,860\nlet's just kind of go over this.\n\n1666\n01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:20,490\nOn the C drive,\nI've got everyone full control.\n\n1667\n01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:24,010\nOn the Sales Folder,\nI'm blocking inheritance.\n\n1668\n01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:26,810\nAnd on the Marketing Folder, I'm not.\n\n1669\n01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:31,193\nSo on the Sales Folder Because I\nblocked inheritance,\n\n1670\n01:24:31,193 --> 01:24:34,950\nI'm giving everyone read and\nthe sales team full control.\n\n1671\n01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:37,940\nIf you're in the sales team you'll be able\nto do whatever you want in there, but\n\n1672\n01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:42,530\nif you're anybody else, admins, marketing,\nwhatever, you're just gonna get read.\n\n1673\n01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,410\nMeanwhile down here at the Marketing\nFolder, I'm allowing inheritance.\n\n1674\n01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:50,530\nSo everyone full control\nis going to apply.\n\n1675\n01:24:50,530 --> 01:24:52,210\nI'm giving marketing full control but\n\n1676\n01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:55,630\nthat's really redundant, because\nmarketing is gonna be a part of everyone.\n\n1677\n01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:59,190\nSo that's kind of a pointless\npermission but you see it all the time.\n\n1678\n01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:04,970\nAnd then sales team deny, that's gonna\noverride the sales team's permission,\n\n1679\n01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:08,170\nand they're not gonna be able\nto get access to that folder.\n\n1680\n01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:10,250\nNow, this is all stuff we've\ntalked about this episode.\n\n1681\n01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:12,800\nThis is all just NTFS permissions.\n\n1682\n01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,569\nHow do the sale, I mean,\nhow do the share permissions get involved?\n\n1683\n01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:19,700\n>> Well they get involved by\naccessing over the share.\n\n1684\n01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:20,380\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1685\n01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:23,740\nIt sounds simple, it sounds silly.\n\n1686\n01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,140\nBut that is it.\n\n1687\n01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:28,400\nIf you access the resource\nover the network\n\n1688\n01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,690\nvia a shared folder then\nthe share permissions kick in.\n\n1689\n01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:34,020\nAnd you have to set share permissions.\n\n1690\n01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:35,950\nWhen you share a folder,\nyou've got to set permissions.\n\n1691\n01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:40,380\nNow the default change in,\nI think it was Windows XP and earlier.\n\n1692\n01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,293\nThe default was when you shared a folder,\n\n1693\n01:25:42,293 --> 01:25:45,420\nthe share permissions default\nwas everyone full control.\n\n1694\n01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:48,030\nAnd then starting, I think it was\nWindows Vista where they changed it,\n\n1695\n01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:49,520\nit might have been XP, it doesn't matter.\n\n1696\n01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,710\nBut the new way,\nwhat you'll see on the exam,\n\n1697\n01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:55,720\nis that the default when you share\na folder is everyone read only.\n\n1698\n01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:01,317\nLet's say that I share the Sales Folder\nand I share the Marketing Folder.\n\n1699\n01:26:01,317 --> 01:26:03,420\nI'm just gonna share these and\n\n1700\n01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:07,920\nso let me just mark those kind of in\nred that this folder is shared and\n\n1701\n01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,910\nthis folder is shared and I'm gonna\nmodify their permissions to reflect that.\n\n1702\n01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:19,765\nAt the share level, when I share that\nsales folder I'm just going to leave\n\n1703\n01:26:19,765 --> 01:26:25,403\nit at the default, which again,\nif I recall correctly is Everyone Read.\n\n1704\n01:26:28,827 --> 01:26:33,162\nAnd I'm just gonna mark that so\nwe can remember that it's different,\n\n1705\n01:26:33,162 --> 01:26:37,509\nthat those are the share permissions\non that folder being shared out.\n\n1706\n01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:42,700\nAnd then I'm gonna share that Marketing\nFolder And I'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n1707\n01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:47,355\nAnd I'm just gonna share it out with the\ndefaults, which would be everyone read.\n\n1708\n01:26:53,671 --> 01:26:56,820\nYou fact checking me, over there?\n\n1709\n01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:57,722\n>> Yes, well, sort of.\n\n1710\n01:26:57,722 --> 01:27:02,490\nWell, there's one thing,\nlike if you share something\n\n1711\n01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:06,050\nthrough the basic sharing, just like,\nyou click to just share this thing.\n\n1712\n01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:10,990\nThen there was, I just looked it up,\nbut you're right, I thought it was like\n\n1713\n01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:16,020\neveryone wanted full control, but then if\nyou go through the advanced sharing and\n\n1714\n01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:18,450\ngo through that way then\nit does it differently.\n\n1715\n01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:21,500\n>> I think on the, isn't it like\nwith a home group it defaults to?\n\n1716\n01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,440\nOh no,\nwith a home group it defaults to you.\n\n1717\n01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,340\nBut when you share on a folder,\n\n1718\n01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:30,430\nlike the way you're gonna see it on\nthe exam, it is everyone gets read.\n\n1719\n01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:31,980\nAnd that's kind of that default.\n\n1720\n01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:37,270\nWe can change that if we want, make it\nwhatever we want, but that's our default.\n\n1721\n01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:41,780\nIf I share these out, and leave\nthe share permissions at everyone read.\n\n1722\n01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,332\nJust giving that permission out.\n\n1723\n01:27:43,332 --> 01:27:48,417\nThen what happens when somebody tries\nto access this folder via the network?\n\n1724\n01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:50,587\nIf they're local,\nif they're sitting at the machine,\n\n1725\n01:27:50,587 --> 01:27:53,679\nit's just the NTFS permissions, the share\npermissions don't come into play.\n\n1726\n01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:54,898\nAnd they're completely ignored.\n\n1727\n01:27:54,898 --> 01:27:55,582\nRight?\n\n1728\n01:27:55,582 --> 01:27:59,603\nBut if they come in on the network\nsomething interesting is gonna happen.\n\n1729\n01:27:59,603 --> 01:28:02,645\nRight?\nThese permissions have to combine together\n\n1730\n01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:06,380\nand the effective permissions\nbecome a lot more complex.\n\n1731\n01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:09,260\n>> All right.\nSo let's throw out the rules here.\n\n1732\n01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:10,080\n>> Okay.\n>> All right, so\n\n1733\n01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,385\nthe rules of combining to make\nour effective permissions.\n\n1734\n01:28:13,385 --> 01:28:17,460\nAll right, I guess yeah,\nwhen accessing over a network.\n\n1735\n01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,920\nSo you take your NTFS\npermissions that you have and\n\n1736\n01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:25,322\nthose get combined and\nyou get the greater out of all of them.\n\n1737\n01:28:25,322 --> 01:28:30,980\nAll right, so you combine them all up and\nthe best one or the, what did you say now?\n\n1738\n01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:33,150\nThe most allowing?\n\n1739\n01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:35,030\n>> I always just call it the best access.\n\n1740\n01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:37,020\nThe best of what you get.\n\n1741\n01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,530\nI don't know,\nis there an official term for it?\n\n1742\n01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:39,800\n>> I don't know either.\n\n1743\n01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,370\nSo, the best you can get, right.?\n\n1744\n01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:42,190\nSo that's what you have.\n\n1745\n01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:46,620\nAnd you add up all your permissions like\nfrom your groups and whatever you're\n\n1746\n01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:51,210\na part of over for the share permissions\n>> And all those guys get added up and\n\n1747\n01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:53,380\nyou get the best of all of them.\n\n1748\n01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:59,400\nWell the least, the most restrictive\nbetween those two, the NTFS and the share\n\n1749\n01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:05,645\nthen the most restrictive one when that's\nfinally, your effective permissions.\n\n1750\n01:29:05,645 --> 01:29:09,135\n>> Now,\neverything Nate just said is 100% correct.\n\n1751\n01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:10,115\nAll right?\n\n1752\n01:29:10,115 --> 01:29:12,190\nDid it sound confusing?\n\n1753\n01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:14,545\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If it did, it's not Nate's fault.\n\n1754\n01:29:14,545 --> 01:29:15,280\nNot this time at least.\n\n1755\n01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not Nate's fault.\n\n1756\n01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,780\nIt just that it is confusing.\n\n1757\n01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:18,940\nIt doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n1758\n01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:21,910\nAnd so that's why I wanted to\ndraw this out in a diagram.\n\n1759\n01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:24,660\nBasically, let's say that\nI'm in the sales department.\n\n1760\n01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,698\nSo, I'm in the sales department and\n\n1761\n01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:30,180\nI browse over the network to\naccess this sales folder.\n\n1762\n01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,200\nWell, there's two different\nsets of permissions.\n\n1763\n01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,190\nSo what happens?\n\n1764\n01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:35,970\nWell I'm in the sales department, and so\n\n1765\n01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:38,850\nwhen I look at these permissions\nI've got everyone read.\n\n1766\n01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:41,740\nWell, I'm a part of everyone and\n\n1767\n01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:44,520\nsales team full control,\nI'm a part of the sales team.\n\n1768\n01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,340\nRight?\nSo what do I get, do I get read or\n\n1769\n01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,350\ndo I get full control?\n\n1770\n01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:50,010\nWell I get the best of those two.\n\n1771\n01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,830\nSo I get the best, which is full control.\n\n1772\n01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:56,920\nSo on the NTFS side,\nI'm gonna get full control.\n\n1773\n01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:00,790\nBut on the sharers side,\nit says everyone read.\n\n1774\n01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,740\nOkay?\nSo there's no figuring out a best there.\n\n1775\n01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:05,410\nThere's only one permission that I get,\nso I get everyone read.\n\n1776\n01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,810\nSo on the sharer side I get read.\n\n1777\n01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,890\nOn the NTFS side, I get full control.\n\n1778\n01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:15,830\nFrom those,\nnow I pick the most restrictive.\n\n1779\n01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:19,100\nThe most restrictive one of those\nis what applies, in this case\n\n1780\n01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:23,850\nread access is the most restrictive, and\nthat's what I'm going to end up with.\n\n1781\n01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:24,540\nOkay?\n\n1782\n01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:28,620\nSo, when we go to figure this out, Right?\n\n1783\n01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:33,993\nSo this would be like\nDetermining Effective Permissions.\n\n1784\n01:30:33,993 --> 01:30:35,160\nAll right?\n\n1785\n01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:40,676\nSo when we go to determine our\neffective permissions, one,\n\n1786\n01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:45,666\ndetermine the best access\nfrom the NTFS permissions.\n\n1787\n01:30:48,373 --> 01:30:50,589\nAnd then determine the best,\n\n1788\n01:30:54,211 --> 01:30:59,643\nAccess from the shared permissions\n>> Yep\n\n1789\n01:30:59,643 --> 01:31:01,975\n>> And then once you've determined\n\n1790\n01:31:01,975 --> 01:31:03,394\nthe best of the two.\n\n1791\n01:31:07,073 --> 01:31:11,148\n>> The most restrictive of the two wins.\n\n1792\n01:31:11,148 --> 01:31:12,566\n>> That sounds good to me.\n\n1793\n01:31:14,748 --> 01:31:15,730\n>> All right.\n\n1794\n01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:19,410\nNow the most restrictive, the most\nrestrictive might be the NTFS permissions.\n\n1795\n01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:21,800\nThe most restrictive might\nbe the share permissions.\n\n1796\n01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,050\nWe don't know which one is\ngonna be the most restrictive.\n\n1797\n01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:27,330\nBut whichever one is the most restrictive,\nthat's the one that wins and\n\n1798\n01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:29,445\nthat's the the permissions\nthat we end up with.\n\n1799\n01:31:29,445 --> 01:31:31,565\nRight?\nSo there's kind of a three-step process,\n\n1800\n01:31:31,565 --> 01:31:33,915\nand the computer's doing it for\nyou in the background.\n\n1801\n01:31:33,915 --> 01:31:36,175\nBut on the exam,\nyou'll get a question rebase and\n\n1802\n01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:38,565\nyou've got to do in your head so\nyou've got to go through this process.\n\n1803\n01:31:38,565 --> 01:31:41,195\nYou'll figure out the best and\ngo from there.\n\n1804\n01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:45,095\nSo if I go back to my example here,\nand let's take, for\n\n1805\n01:31:45,095 --> 01:31:48,545\nexample, let me just\nchange this a little bit.\n\n1806\n01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:51,200\nAll right.\nLet me change it here.\n\n1807\n01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,770\nSo if I'm in the Sales Department and\n\n1808\n01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:56,702\nI browsed to the marketing\nfolder via the network.\n\n1809\n01:31:56,702 --> 01:31:57,840\nAll right?\n\n1810\n01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,550\nWell on the share side,\nI've got everyone full control.\n\n1811\n01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,800\nI'm in the Sales Department,\nso I'm in everyone.\n\n1812\n01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,320\nI get full control.\n\n1813\n01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:11,910\nWell, in the NTFS Permissions, Everyone,\nFull Control is trickling down.\n\n1814\n01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:14,390\nRight?\nBecause we've got Inheritance turned on.\n\n1815\n01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:19,640\nSo, so\nthis permission up here is trickling down.\n\n1816\n01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,730\nRight?\nAs part of that inheritance.\n\n1817\n01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,390\nSo Everyone- Full Control.\n\n1818\n01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:26,720\nSales Tea deny and\nthen marketing full control.\n\n1819\n01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,130\nWell, I'm in sales.\n\n1820\n01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:29,920\nSales team is denied.\n\n1821\n01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:35,830\nA deny overrides everything else so\non the NTFS side I've got a deny.\n\n1822\n01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:38,510\nOn the share side I've got full control.\n\n1823\n01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:43,010\nSo I end up with the most restrictive\nof the two which is deny.\n\n1824\n01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:46,160\n>> And so, even though the share\npermissions are giving me full control,\n\n1825\n01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,570\nI'm denied access to this folder.\n\n1826\n01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:48,540\nI can't get to it.\n\n1827\n01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,180\nAll right.\n\n1828\n01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:52,772\n>> All right, well let's say,\nlet's say you are a marketing seller.\n\n1829\n01:32:52,772 --> 01:32:53,350\nAll right.\n\n1830\n01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:55,600\nAnd so\nyou are part of the marketing group.\n\n1831\n01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,200\nAnd the sales group.\n\n1832\n01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:57,770\nRight?\n>> Okay.\n\n1833\n01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:01,240\n>> So NTFS, the marketing people,\nthey have full control on the NTFS.\n\n1834\n01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,650\nIs that gonna change anything?\n\n1835\n01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:06,260\n>> This is where that deny is gonna\ncome back to bite us in the but.\n\n1836\n01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:06,900\nRight?\n\n1837\n01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:11,330\nIf I'm in both marketing and sales,\nlet's go back to my diagram here.\n\n1838\n01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:14,955\nIf I'm in marketing and sales, and access\nthat marketing folder over the network.\n\n1839\n01:33:14,955 --> 01:33:15,895\nAll right.\n\n1840\n01:33:15,895 --> 01:33:22,420\nWhen we combine these NTFS Permissions,\nthe deny overrides everything.\n\n1841\n01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:24,480\nSo even though I'm in marketing, and\n\n1842\n01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,540\nI get full control, even though\nthe share gives me full control.\n\n1843\n01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:31,070\nEven though at NTFS everyone\nfull control restricted on that.\n\n1844\n01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:37,010\nEven though three ways I'm getting full\ncontrol, that one deny overrides it all.\n\n1845\n01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:38,170\nI'm denied access.\n\n1846\n01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:39,102\nI can't get into this folder.\n\n1847\n01:33:39,102 --> 01:33:40,060\nAll right?\n\n1848\n01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:43,590\nSo that's why we typically don't want\nto use denies if we can avoid it,\n\n1849\n01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:46,530\nbecause it makes it really difficult to\ngive out access to people who are in more\n\n1850\n01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:47,200\nthan one group.\n\n1851\n01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,580\nRight?\nIt just wreaks havoc.\n\n1852\n01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:50,390\nRight?\nAnd unless we've done some really,\n\n1853\n01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:52,680\nreally, really good\nplanning with our groups.\n\n1854\n01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,278\nWhich most people don't.\n\n1855\n01:33:55,278 --> 01:33:58,000\nSo, that's the thing to remember\nis kind of how these apply.\n\n1856\n01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,440\nYou take the best of\nyour share permissions,\n\n1857\n01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,770\nyou take the best of\nyour NTFS permissions..\n\n1858\n01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,140\nAnd then you compare them,\nwhichever one is the most restrictive,\n\n1859\n01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:09,570\nthe worst, that's the one that wins.\n\n1860\n01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:14,880\n>> All right, so on that sales team\nfolder, so if that deny was a read.\n\n1861\n01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,750\nRight?\nThen of\n\n1862\n01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,340\ncourse that would change everything.\n\n1863\n01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:19,920\nAnd then they would have\nfull control over that.\n\n1864\n01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,750\n>> Yeah, yeah, let's run through that.\n\n1865\n01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:26,250\nRight, so again,\nI'm in the marketing and sales group.\n\n1866\n01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:26,950\nRight?\n\n1867\n01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:29,150\nAnd I access marketing over the network.\n\n1868\n01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:31,400\nWell on the share side,\neveryone full control.\n\n1869\n01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,970\nRight?\nWe're gonna get full control.\n\n1870\n01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:36,890\nOn the NTFS side,\neveryone full control trickles down.\n\n1871\n01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:38,260\nSales team read.\n\n1872\n01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,390\nI'm in sales.\n\n1873\n01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:41,820\nI'm in marketing too, full control.\n\n1874\n01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:45,760\nSo between the two full controls and\nthe read on the NTFS side,\n\n1875\n01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,410\nI end up with full control.\n\n1876\n01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:52,060\nAt the share side, I get full control, so\nI end up with my resultant permissions,\n\n1877\n01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,990\nmy effective permissions are full control.\n\n1878\n01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:56,090\n>> Nice.\n\n1879\n01:34:56,090 --> 01:35:00,860\n>> So, on the exam,\nremember the three steps.\n\n1880\n01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:04,340\nFind the best of the NTFS permissions.\n\n1881\n01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:07,510\nFind the best of the share permissions.\n\n1882\n01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:12,020\nAnd then between the two pick the most\nrestrictive, that's the one that wins.\n\n1883\n01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,149\nAnd then I'm gonna add a unofficial step.\n\n1884\n01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:17,610\nRemember that denies.\n\n1885\n01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:21,450\nLet me just do that lower case.\n\n1886\n01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:21,950\nDenies.\n\n1887\n01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:25,100\nThere we go.\n\n1888\n01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,000\nOverride everything.\n\n1889\n01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,870\nRight?\nDenies override everything,\n\n1890\n01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:30,390\nthere's no way to get around a deny.\n\n1891\n01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:33,205\nSo just kind of remember that\nas an unofficial fourth step.\n\n1892\n01:35:33,205 --> 01:35:33,910\nRight?\n\n1893\n01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:38,880\nNow in real life land, let me give\nyou guys a little bit of advice.\n\n1894\n01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,892\nOkay?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1895\n01:35:39,892 --> 01:35:42,210\n>> It gets, not challenging,\n\n1896\n01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:45,115\nwhat's the right word to use here?\n\n1897\n01:35:45,115 --> 01:35:46,021\nAnnoying.\n\n1898\n01:35:46,021 --> 01:35:50,375\nIt gets annoying to have to manage\npermissions in two different places.\n\n1899\n01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:52,669\nTo have to deal with NTFS permissions and\n\n1900\n01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:55,420\nshare permissions to\nfind that balance right?\n\n1901\n01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:59,250\n99% of the time we've got a file\nserver somewhere that nobody is\n\n1902\n01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:00,550\nlogging into locally anyway and\n\n1903\n01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:04,260\neverybody is just coming in anyway across\nthe shares so when we go to assign our\n\n1904\n01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:08,890\npermissions it's kind of nice to just\nhave one place to worry about it.\n\n1905\n01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:12,840\nWell, at the NTFS level you have a lot\nmore control than you do at the share\n\n1906\n01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:17,600\nlevel and so typically I don't like\nto worry about share permissions and\n\n1907\n01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,840\nI rely on NTFS exclusively.\n\n1908\n01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,560\nFor example when I share that sales folder\nI set share permissions right here.\n\n1909\n01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,900\nYou can't set share permission on a file.\n\n1910\n01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:32,300\nIf you wanna override permissions on\nan individual file you've got to use NTFS.\n\n1911\n01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:36,360\nIn real life, what I do,\nevery time I share a folder,\n\n1912\n01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:39,620\nat the share permission,\nI always set it to everyone, full control.\n\n1913\n01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:43,270\nIt's what I do, or\nauthenticated users, full control.\n\n1914\n01:36:43,270 --> 01:36:49,560\nAt least you have to log in, I'll set it\nto just say anybody has full control.\n\n1915\n01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:53,160\nAnd then at the NTFS level I\napply my restrictions, and\n\n1916\n01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:58,210\nthat way when I set permissions I\nalways know it's at the NTFS level\n\n1917\n01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:01,800\nI need to set them and I don't ever look\nat those share permissions ever again.\n\n1918\n01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,800\nYou just set them to everyone\nfull control, you leave them be,\n\n1919\n01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,050\nyou do your permissions at the NTFS level.\n\n1920\n01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:09,460\nIt makes things a lot simpler,\nit's easier to trouble shoot.\n\n1921\n01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:12,350\nAnd it's effective whether somebody's\ncoming in over the network or\n\n1922\n01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:13,930\nthey sit down locally at the machine.\n\n1923\n01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:16,303\nYou get the best of everything.\n\n1924\n01:37:16,303 --> 01:37:19,460\nBut on the exam you need to know both.\n\n1925\n01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:25,660\n>> Perhaps it's already implied.\n\n1926\n01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:30,930\nIf you're of course accessing these files\nlocally if they're on your own machine\n\n1927\n01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:34,050\nthen share permissions\nare never even accounted for\n\n1928\n01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:35,830\ninto your effective permissions.\n\n1929\n01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:36,900\n>> Right.\n\n1930\n01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,420\nIf your drive is fat 32 right?\n\n1931\n01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:42,560\nLet's say we formatted\nthis drive as fat 32 Well,\n\n1932\n01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,670\nin that case,\nyou don't even have NTFS permissions.\n\n1933\n01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:47,045\nRight?\n\n1934\n01:37:47,045 --> 01:37:50,520\nSo,you don't have these\nlocal permissions at all.\n\n1935\n01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:54,940\nBut, on a fat 32 drive when you\nshare out those folders, or\n\n1936\n01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:57,005\nexfat for that matter any of them.\n\n1937\n01:37:57,005 --> 01:37:59,455\nWhen you share them out,\nyou can still set share permissions.\n\n1938\n01:37:59,455 --> 01:38:00,075\nRight?\n\n1939\n01:38:00,075 --> 01:38:06,180\nAnd you can still come in and say everyone\nread or we might say everyone read and\n\n1940\n01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:10,980\nsales full control all right?\n\n1941\n01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:13,810\nAnd even though we don't have NTFS\npermissions, the share permissions\n\n1942\n01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:17,630\nare kicking in, if somebody logs in\nlocally, they're gonna have full access to\n\n1943\n01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:20,610\nall these files, but if they're coming in\nover the network now, they're limited.\n\n1944\n01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:24,764\nJust remember, on a FAT32 drive,\nall you have are share permissions,\n\n1945\n01:38:24,764 --> 01:38:26,844\non an NTFS drive, you've got both.\n\n1946\n01:38:26,844 --> 01:38:29,921\nThe share, and\nthe NTFS permissions to mess with.\n\n1947\n01:38:29,921 --> 01:38:32,740\n>> All right, so let me ask you this.\n\n1948\n01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,680\nLet's say you are a user, and\n\n1949\n01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:38,070\nyou are logging into a computer\nthrough remote desktop.\n\n1950\n01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:42,760\nAnd you access a file on that\ncomputer through remote desktop.\n\n1951\n01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:47,015\nYou take and\nconsider the share permissions, or\n\n1952\n01:38:47,015 --> 01:38:50,350\nyou considered local, or just NTFS?\n\n1953\n01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,719\n>> Let make sure I follow you.\n\n1954\n01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:55,715\nSo if you're sitting at the machine\n>> Let's say if you remote\n\n1955\n01:38:55,715 --> 01:38:58,500\ndesktop into client one\n>> Okay\n\n1956\n01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,630\n>> And you access the file\n\n1957\n01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:01,080\non client one\n>> Okay\n\n1958\n01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:01,660\n>> You take in\n\n1959\n01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:03,110\nconsideration shared permissions.\n\n1960\n01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:05,010\nEven though you're sort\nof going around that.\n\n1961\n01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:06,210\n>> If you're a remote desktop,\n\n1962\n01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:10,080\nyou're treated as if you're\nsitting at the machine, right?\n\n1963\n01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,780\nSo it would just be the NTFS permissions.\n\n1964\n01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:14,600\nBut there is an exception to that.\n\n1965\n01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,270\nEven if you are sitting at the machine.\n\n1966\n01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:19,450\nIf I'm sitting at my computer, right?\n\n1967\n01:39:19,450 --> 01:39:26,100\nIf I were to go into Windows Explorer,\nFile Explorer.\n\n1968\n01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,440\nWhatever that thing is called.\n\n1969\n01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,780\nWhy do they change the name of\neverything between versions of Windows?\n\n1970\n01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:31,739\n>> You have things to talk about.\n\n1971\n01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:34,132\n>> That's a good point.\n\n1972\n01:39:34,132 --> 01:39:36,035\nI have something to put in the show,\nright?\n\n1973\n01:39:36,035 --> 01:39:40,650\nLet me I just create a folder here and\nI'm gonna share it out.\n\n1974\n01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:43,380\nSo let me share it with specific people.\n\n1975\n01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:45,920\nI'll share it with me.\n\n1976\n01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,283\nI'm sharing this folder out.\n\n1977\n01:39:47,283 --> 01:39:52,440\nAnd all right, if [LAUGH] I browse,\nand I'm remote desk-topped\n\n1978\n01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:57,215\ninto this machine right now,\nif I browse into that folder,\n\n1979\n01:39:57,215 --> 01:40:01,970\nNTFS permissions are the only\nthing that applied.\n\n1980\n01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:02,780\nOkay.\n\n1981\n01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:10,310\nBut, if I browse to //itprotv- CL1,\nall right?\n\n1982\n01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:13,380\nAnd I browse into it this way.\n\n1983\n01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,280\nOkay?\n\n1984\n01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,530\nIf I browse into it this way,\n\n1985\n01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:19,760\nit's the share permissions\nthat are applying, right?\n\n1986\n01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,574\nBecause I came in using the UNC,\n\n1987\n01:40:22,574 --> 01:40:27,482\nthe shared Server name,\nright, //itprotv-cl1.\n\n1988\n01:40:27,482 --> 01:40:31,194\nEven though I'm local, I browse to\nit as if it was a network drive and\n\n1989\n01:40:31,194 --> 01:40:33,420\nthe share permissions will apply.\n\n1990\n01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,684\nAnd that would happen if I\nwas sitting at the machine or\n\n1991\n01:40:35,684 --> 01:40:38,766\nif I was remote desktop like this\njust be aware, that little variation.\n\n1992\n01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:40,624\nMakes it kind of confusing, but it is,\n\n1993\n01:40:40,624 --> 01:40:42,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is true.\n\n1994\n01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:43,930\n>> Yeah, right on.\n\n1995\n01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:45,450\n>> I don't know if that's what\nyou were driving at, but.\n\n1996\n01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:50,280\n>> No, I just, I don't know,\njust conversation I suppose.\n\n1997\n01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,639\n>> Yeah, well it's good to know\nthe exceptions and the outliers.\n\n1998\n01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:59,280\n>> Nate, I think that's about\nall I've got on permissions,\n\n1999\n01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,560\ncan you think of anything\nthat we've left out.\n\n2000\n01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,780\n>> Oh, goodness.\n\n2001\n01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:07,605\nYeah, I think we've covered\neverything very well on the client\n\n2002\n01:41:07,605 --> 01:41:11,950\nside or,what you'd run into on this.\n\n2003\n01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:13,457\n>> We've been fairly exhaustive today.\n\n2004\n01:41:13,457 --> 01:41:14,176\n>> It's been a good episode.\n\n2005\n01:41:14,176 --> 01:41:14,756\n>> Yeah.\n\n2006\n01:41:14,756 --> 01:41:18,920\n>> So, not that are episodes are only bad,\nbut this one this one's been pretty good.\n\n2007\n01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:22,560\nSo all right, so yeah,\nthat's about all I can think of.\n\n2008\n01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,790\nLadies and gentlemen,\njust keep in mind a couple of things.\n\n2009\n01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:28,070\nFirst of all, if you ever have any\nquestions, live during the show,\n\n2010\n01:41:28,070 --> 01:41:32,390\njump over to itpro.tv/live.you can\npost your questions, we monitor and\n\n2011\n01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,810\nanswer them during the show,\nwhich is always fun.\n\n2012\n01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:37,690\nIf you have questions after the show\nthat's how I am, middle of the night,\n\n2013\n01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:39,220\nyou think of these things\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2014\n01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:43,220\n>> Then, go to itpro.tv, any page there,\n\n2015\n01:41:43,220 -->

it's Saturday.\n\n17\n00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:48,454\n>> Oh, rejection.\n\n18\n00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:49,551\n>> Yep.\nRejection again.\n\n19\n00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,735\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes,\n\n20\n00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:55,600\nI did not get on another\nepisode of Tattoo Nightmares.\n\n21\n00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,362\n>> Tattoo Nightmares, now,\n\n22\n00:00:57,362 --> 00:01:01,966\nthat means your particular tattooing\nquest was just too challenging?\n\n23\n00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:04,050\n>> Well, two words here, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,735\nHard-boiled eggs, and LAN dancing,\nso that's just enough-\n\n25\n00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:08,298\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,156\n>> To get to kind of, yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:11,694\n>> Yeah, we all know what's going on here.\n\n28\n00:01:11,694 --> 00:01:13,313\nThey said, basically-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:15,443\n>> They can't cover up that much pink,\n\n30\n00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,890\nfrom a Hello Kitty logo.\n\n31\n00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,528\n>> Yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:20,267\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:21,759\n>> All right, well, ladies, and gentlemen,\n\n34\n00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,828\nwe've got a fun episode today.\n\n35\n00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:26,444\nWe've got another Windows 8,\nthe 70-688 exam show going on.\n\n36\n00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:29,553\nAnd we're gonna be taking\na look at troubleshooting, and\n\n37\n00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:31,210\na few other different things.\n\n38\n00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,416\nResolving issues surrounding IP\nconnectivity, and in the old days,\n\n39\n00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:40,345\nthese episodes would have been simple,\ncuz it would just be IPv4 connectivity.\n\n40\n00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:45,338\nBut in the new era, now, we have IPv4,\nand IPv6 connectivity to worry about.\n\n41\n00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,981\nAnd so, we've got to take a look at both.\n\n42\n00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:51,157\nAnd for a lot of people that are kind\nof moving into this career field,\n\n43\n00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:54,758\nIPv4 almost comes as second nature,\ncuz we use it so much.\n\n44\n00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:56,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> But that IPv6 stuff,\n\n45\n00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,852\nthat's tricky because a lot of people\njust don't have great exposure to it.\n\n46\n00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:02,785\nSo that's,\nwhat we're gonna take a look at today, and\n\n47\n00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:03,947\nwe'll see what damage we can do.\n\n48\n00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,280\n>> Yeah.\nWe're gonna be seeing a lot of different\n\n49\n00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,136\nthings that you may not have actually\nseen before, in terms of troubleshooting.\n\n50\n00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:11,383\nRight?\nBut the good thing is,\n\n51\n00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,406\nthe steps that you might\nhave learned previously,\n\n52\n00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:15,493\nin other operating systems\nare gonna help you here.\n\n53\n00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:18,105\nThe IPv6,\nmaybe be a little bit newer for us.\n\n54\n00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:21,099\nWe're also gonna end up,\ntaking a look at the idea of things like,\n\n55\n00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,814\nsome name resolution issues as well.\n\n56\n00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:24,544\nSo, we'll see, what else happens too.\n\n57\n00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,264\nYep.\n\n58\n00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:26,640\n>> All of the different things,\nit can bring.\n\n59\n00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,919\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Now, fortunately, for most of us,\n\n60\n00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,032\nif we're dealing with IPv4 networks,\nin fact, let's just start with IPv4.\n\n61\n00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:33,659\n>> Okay.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n62\n00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,537\n>> Because I think, if we try,\n\n63\n00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,141\nand blend the two-\n>> Yeah.\n\n64\n00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:35,873\n>> [CROSSTALK] it's going\nto be too confusing.\n\n65\n00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:40,482\nSo, with IPv4 networks,\nmost of us are gonna be using DHCP.\n\n66\n00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:40,997\n>> Right.\n\n67\n00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,975\n>> Dynamic host configuration protocol,\nand\n\n68\n00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:46,298\nthat means you're gonna power on your\nlaptop, or power on your desktop.\n\n69\n00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:51,031\nIt's gonna ask the network, could somebody\nout there please give me an IP address?\n\n70\n00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:55,435\nAnd the DHCP server is gonna respond,\ngiving you an address, and\n\n71\n00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:58,971\nlikely giving you a gateway,\na subnet mask, a DNS.\n\n72\n00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,012\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, giving you all that stuff too,\n\n73\n00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:03,644\nso, you can get it all together,\nand you're ready to rock.\n\n74\n00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:04,155\nRight?\n\n75\n00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:07,098\nSo, if that's the case,\nwhat do we troubleshoot?\n\n76\n00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:10,778\nWell, in that scenario, there's not\na whole heck of a lot to troubleshoot.\n\n77\n00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:11,347\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n78\n00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:15,521\nIf you're not getting your DHCP address,\nwell, what could cause that?\n\n79\n00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,779\nDHCP server could be off.\n\n80\n00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:18,596\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n81\n00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:20,746\n[LAUGH]\n>> For one reason, or another,\n\n82\n00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:24,064\nyour own machine though, might actually\nhave just been disconnected from network,\n\n83\n00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:25,507\nand you're not getting an address.\n\n84\n00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:28,021\nSo, there's a lots of different things,\nthat could be on.\n\n85\n00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:28,584\n>> Yeah.\n\n86\n00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,824\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, let's think of the scenarios here.\n\n87\n00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,306\nWhen it comes to DHCP,\n\n88\n00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:34,324\nthere's really not much-\n>> Yeah.\n\n89\n00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:35,723\n>> On the client side, that we configure.\n\n90\n00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:39,062\nSo, on the exam, when it comes to\ntroubleshooting something like IPv4\n\n91\n00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:42,752\naddressing for dynamic addressing,\nthere's really one thing, we look for.\n\n92\n00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:45,198\nAnd that is whether, or not we've\ngot dynamic addressing turned on,\n\n93\n00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:45,908\nin the first place.\n\n94\n00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:46,442\nAll right.\n\n95\n00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:49,830\nSo, let's take a look at some of\nthe different things that we might need to\n\n96\n00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,250\nconfigure, if we're gonna\nuse DHCP on the client.\n\n97\n00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,964\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n98\n00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:55,186\nAnd you'll see what I mean, when I say\nthere's not a whole heck of a lot,\n\n99\n00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:56,000\nthat we can screw up here.\n\n100\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,438\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I go into my Network Sharing Center,\n\n101\n00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,950\nand I go into my Adapter Settings,\nright, I can pull up that adapter.\n\n102\n00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,912\nAnd the whole point of DHCP is that the\nthing's supposed to be automatic, right?\n\n103\n00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:09,556\nRight?\n\n104\n00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:14,382\nSo, if I pull up the Properties, I can\nsee this machine has a Static IP, but\n\n105\n00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:19,304\nif I choose to go Automatic, now,\nit's gonna get one from the DHCP server.\n\n106\n00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:22,004\nAnd problems on the server side, right?\n\n107\n00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:23,849\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz this is a workstation exam,\n\n108\n00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,154\nnot a server exam, problems on\nthe server side should be there, and\n\n109\n00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:28,437\nwe should get an address.\n\n110\n00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:29,575\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n111\n00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:32,350\nSo, what could cause us not\nto unplug a network adapter?\n\n112\n00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,371\n>> Yep.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:33,871\n>> That's it.\n\n114\n00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:34,393\nYeah.\n\n115\n00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:35,135\n>> [CROSSTALK] big one.\n\n116\n00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:36,258\nThere are a few other\n\n117\n00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:36,791\nthings-\n\n118\n00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:37,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That can cause\n\n119\n00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,259\nproblems.\n>> Yep.\n\n120\n00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,106\n[LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:40,831\n>> And I never got this [LAUGH]\n\n122\n00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,461\nprotection, that sort of thing.\nFor those of you,\n\n123\n00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:48,290\nwatching live, you probably noticed that-\n>> [LAUGH] My fault.\n\n124\n00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,530\n>> I wasn't getting an address for moment,\n\n125\n00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,957\nand yeah,\nit was a server that was blocking me.\n\n126\n00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,607\n>> Yeah that's me.\n\n127\n00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:52,417\n>> So, there's\n\n128\n00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,369\na number of server issues that can happen.\n>> Right.\n\n129\n00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,795\n>> But the whole point of DHCP,\n\n130\n00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,486\nis that it's automatic.\n>> Yeah.\n\n131\n00:04:58,486 --> 00:04:59,117\n>> So, on the client side,\n\n132\n00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:00,268\nthere's not all that much-\n>> Right.\n\n133\n00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:00,874\n>> That can go wrong for\n\n134\n00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,073\nautomatic configuration.\nAll right.\n\n135\n00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:04,243\nBut static configurations, well,\n\n136\n00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,694\nthere we can start to have some problems.\n\n137\n00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:07,274\n>> Yes.\n>> All right?\n\n138\n00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,057\nAnd the number one problem,\n\n139\n00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:09,829\ntypos.\n>> Yep.\n\n140\n00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:10,374\n>> Right?\n\n141\n00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:10,954\n>> By far.\n\n142\n00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:12,396\n>> Anytime you manually enter something\n\n143\n00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,437\nin, it's really easy to make a mistake.\nLet me show you guys, what I mean.\n\n144\n00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:18,066\nI guess there is one thing,\n\n145\n00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:21,265\nthat I do wanna point out on DHCP,\n\n146\n00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:25,071\nis that you might be set to use DHCP-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n147\n00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:28,652\n>> But using static DNS servers, right?\n\n148\n00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:31,217\nYou can override some of the values from\n\n149\n00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:31,843\nDNS-\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n150\n00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:33,566\n>> So, if you're pulling a DHCP address,\n\n151\n00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,048\nbutt you're getting the wrong DNS servers,\nit might be,\n\n152\n00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:37,993\nbecause you've overridden them.\n>> Right.\n\n153\n00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:38,775\n>> Right here,\n\n154\n00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:42,434\njust to show you that in action.\nOn this machine,\n\n155\n00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:47,359\nif I do an ipconfig/all.\nIf I spell it, all right,\n\n156\n00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:51,963\nthere we go.\nI can see that I have a 10.1.230.221\n\n157\n00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:56,795\naddress, but this is a static, right?\nAnd I know, it's not a static\n\n158\n00:05:56,795 --> 00:06:00,014\nbecause I don't have a DHCP server listed.\nSo,\n\n159\n00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:04,731\nI'm not pulling an automatic address.\nAnd I'll see my DNS servers that I pulled\n\n160\n00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,999\nfrom DHCP, so I'm gonna switch over, to\nget a DHCP address, and I'm gonna lose my\n\n161\n00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:14,594\nconnection to this server, when I do it.\nSo, let me just go ahead,\n\n162\n00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:18,480\nand specify that.\nAnd there goes my connection, and so, now,\n\n163\n00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,045\nI need to figure out what address it got.\nSo, I'm just gonna pull up our\n\n164\n00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,906\nDHCP server, and figure out what\naddress that machine just got.\n\n165\n00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:25,486\n>> Yep.\n\n166\n00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,268\n>> Eventually.\n\n167\n00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:34,557\nThere we go.\nAnd what will happen is by default with\n\n168\n00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:39,727\nDHCP, you get your IP address, probably\nyour gateway, although that is optional.\n\n169\n00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:42,211\nYour DNS servers, things of that nature,\n\n170\n00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:45,249\nthat's what you're pulling\nfrom the DHCP server.\n\n171\n00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:49,051\nBut they can be overridden, and\nthat' what I want to show you guys.\n\n172\n00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:52,145\nSo, if I go in here,\nwhat is that machine called?\n\n173\n00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,881\nThat's ITProTV client 1.\n\n174\n00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,465\n>> [CROSSTALK] they've\ngot the same address.\n\n175\n00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:56,638\n>> It did, it's got a reservation.\n\n176\n00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:57,398\nThere we go.\n\n177\n00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:58,118\n>> There we go.\n>> Yeah,\n\n178\n00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,441\nit makes that convenient, doesn't it?\n\n179\n00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,699\n>> Yes.\n>> All right.\n\n180\n00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,183\nSo, when I do an ipconfig/all right now,\n\n181\n00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:08,467\nI can see that I'm getting\nsome DNS servers 10.1.230.201.\n\n182\n00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,313\nThat's the one I want,\nand then, one of Google's.\n\n183\n00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:12,298\nBut I can override it, right here.\n\n184\n00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:17,384\nAnd when I do that, this is where it\ngets a little bit tricky because in\n\n185\n00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:23,377\nthis screen, it's really obvious,\nthat the DNS servers have been overriden.\n\n186\n00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:24,678\nWe can see it, right here.\n\n187\n00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:28,479\nBut on the exam, it might not\ngive you access to that screen.\n\n188\n00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,468\n>> Right.\n>> They might show you something,\n\n189\n00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:31,063\nlike this.\n\n190\n00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:32,235\nLet me just clear that out.\n\n191\n00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,084\nThey'll normally spell it right,\nunlike me.\n\n192\n00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:36,891\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n193\n00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,265\nSo, they might give you\nsome output like this.\n\n194\n00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:44,647\nThat shows you a network adapter,\nand it says,\n\n195\n00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:48,043\nyou've got a workstation configured for\nDHCP.\n\n196\n00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:52,293\nIt's pulling an address, but\nthe DNS servers are incorrect.\n\n197\n00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:53,208\nWhat could be the possible cause?\n\n198\n00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,667\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, something like that.\n\n199\n00:07:54,667 --> 00:08:00,625\nAnd when you look at it, it shows DHCP\nserver, alright, DHCP enabled, yes.\n\n200\n00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:05,366\nLooking at this, there is no way to\nactually tell from this command output\n\n201\n00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:09,265\nthat the DNS servers have been\noverridden on the interface so\n\n202\n00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:13,340\nwe just have to be aware that\nis something that can be done.\n\n203\n00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,885\nThis output doesn't tell you exactly\nwhere those settings came from.\n\n204\n00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:19,265\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n205\n00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:23,062\n>> So, that's an example of\na type of issue you might have.\n\n206\n00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:26,201\nThe machine might have been set for\na static before and\n\n207\n00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:30,898\nsomebody flipped it to dynamic, just\nthe IP, and forgot to do the DNS entries.\n\n208\n00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,117\n>> Right.\n\n209\n00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:34,195\n>> You might not notice that for\nmonths or years.\n\n210\n00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,219\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It might be when you decommission\n\n211\n00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,583\nthe old DNS servers and\nyou realize this machine's off.\n\n212\n00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,976\nSo there's things like that.\n\n213\n00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:44,714\nAnd the same goes for other things like\nthe connection specific DNS suffix,\n\n214\n00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:47,615\nthose can be overridden\non the interface too.\n\n215\n00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,114\nSo the only thing that can't be\noverridden when you're set for\n\n216\n00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,490\nDHCP is the IP address,\nsubnet mask, and default gateway.\n\n217\n00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,500\nThose are the only things\nthat can't be overwritten.\n\n218\n00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,530\nAll right, if we're doing a static\naddress, though, that's where we've really\n\n219\n00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,260\ngotta worry about types and problems,\nand the typos are easy, you know.\n\n220\n00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,869\nIt's just a matter of punching things in.\n\n221\n00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:14,857\nMaybe my IP address scheme on\nthis network is 192.168.0, and\n\n222\n00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:17,720\nI want to be 192.168.0.200, okay?\n\n223\n00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,800\nSo I punch that in and there it goes.\n\n224\n00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,865\nBut then I go to another network and\nit's a 172.16 class B network right.\n\n225\n00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:32,390\nWell you saw right there a second\nago where it automatically filled\n\n226\n00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,870\nin that subnet for me and if this is\nblank when you put in a subnet, when you\n\n227\n00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,820\nput in an address it will automatically\nguess what that's going to be.\n\n228\n00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,513\nSo if I put in 172.16.0.1,\n\n229\n00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:48,180\nsee how it guessed that it\nwas supposed to be a class B?\n\n230\n00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,530\nLet me just zoom in on that.\n\n231\n00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000\nThere we go.\n\n232\n00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,313\nSo it guessed that it was\nsupposed to be a class b.\n\n233\n00:09:55,313 --> 00:10:01,791\nWell then I go home and I need to\nget back on my 192.168 network, and\n\n234\n00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:07,032\nso I go in here and\nI punch in 192.168.0.200.\n\n235\n00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:09,330\nSee how didn't guess?\n\n236\n00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,208\nOnce there is already a subnet mask in\nthere it no longer automatically tries to\n\n237\n00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,323\ncalculate that field and so\nit's very easy to overlook that and\n\n238\n00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,052\nleave the wrong sudden estimate.\n\n239\n00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:21,440\n>> Yeah, and when you're\nstatically typing it in, right.\n\n240\n00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,892\nEven then especially subnet mask if\nsomebody is trying to do this really\n\n241\n00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:29,823\nquickly, they may just type in\nthe wrong number simply by doing\n\n242\n00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:33,407\n255.255.254 sometimes ends up happening.\n\n243\n00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:36,830\nOr they just don't fill in the rest of it\nand that's where we also have issues too.\n\n244\n00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,055\n>> You know that you know the one that I\nalways do Ronnie is I'm going to do and\n\n245\n00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:45,904\nI'm typing right so I'm like 192.167.9 and\nthen I'm like, oh, wait,\n\n246\n00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:48,007\nI didn't want 167 or whatever.\n\n247\n00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:51,860\nAnd you hit your backspace key and\nit moves into that previous field,\n\n248\n00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,928\nyou start typing for the next thing.\n\n249\n00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:55,871\nAnd so it's really easy to screw up and\n\n250\n00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,025\nyou end up with something like 192.160\nwhen that's not what you wanted.\n\n251\n00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:02,445\nSo definitely easy to make\nmistakes like that, so\n\n252\n00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:06,565\njust verifying the data that's put\nin there and just paying attention.\n\n253\n00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,685\nNot just to the last octet, but\nto all four octets, you know,\n\n254\n00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,580\nmaking sure you pay attention to all that.\n\n255\n00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,880\nAnd you know subnet masks\nare pretty important right.\n\n256\n00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,240\nLet's hold off on subnet masks cause they\ncan take a little while to explain to you.\n\n257\n00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,010\nIn the next segment I want to tackle\nsubnet masks and go into those.\n\n258\n00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,160\nBut you got to make sure you got\nthem put in there in the proper.\n\n259\n00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,300\nIf you have the wrong subnet mask,\n\n260\n00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,670\nyour machine may not go to it's default\ngateway when it's suppose to, or\n\n261\n00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,130\nit may go to the default gateway\nduring times when it shouldn't.\n\n262\n00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,690\nSo there's where it's sending traffic\nto the router that's inappropriate.\n\n263\n00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,720\nSo we've got to verify that.\n\n264\n00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,530\n>> And just like we saw earlier\nwith the command prompt here,\n\n265\n00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,910\nyou may end up getting the command prompt\nwhere they show you the information.\n\n266\n00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,160\nAnd they're just really saying,\nwhich of the following issues could it be?\n\n267\n00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,510\nSo, they might actually give you\nseveral options there, and try and\n\n268\n00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,010\nactually see if you actually know what's\nmissing, or what is incorrectly typed in.\n\n269\n00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,740\nSo, be aware of that, too.\n\n270\n00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,830\n>> The other thing that we could run\ninto is a little more obvious, which is,\n\n271\n00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,020\nif we do something like\na duplicate IP address.\n\n272\n00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,840\nIf we assign an IP address to this machine\nthat's already in use on the network.\n\n273\n00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,550\nSo for example,\nRonnie let's use you as a guinea pig.\n\n274\n00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,765\n>> Sure.\n>> What IP address do you have on\n\n275\n00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:17,305\nyour machine?\n\n276\n00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:20,962\n>> [LAUGH] Good question.\n\n277\n00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:23,454\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> If you're using DHCP,\n\n278\n00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:27,345\nin theory you shouldn't get duplicate IPs,\nbut it can happen.\n\n279\n00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:28,910\nYou know what actually, do this, Ronnie.\n\n280\n00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,000\nI'm gonna go back to\ndynamic addressing here.\n\n281\n00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,500\n>> Okay.\n\n282\n00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,100\nAll right And why don't you change\nyour laptop's IP to match this PC's?\n\n283\n00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,950\nSo I'm using DHCP right now.\n\n284\n00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,930\nSo I'm pulling a DHCP address.\n\n285\n00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,221\nI'm going to get Ronnie to\nchange his laptop over so\n\n286\n00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:50,112\nthat he's going to use the same\nIP address as this workstation.\n\n287\n00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:55,151\nNow I am 10.1.230.201.\n\n288\n00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:58,480\nAnd so he's going to change his\nIP address to be the same one.\n\n289\n00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,230\nAnd what's going to happen is there's\ngoing to be a duplicate IP on the network.\n\n290\n00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,730\nNow Windows is pretty smart about it.\n\n291\n00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,260\nWhat will happen is if it's a Windows\nmachine causing the duplicate IP,\n\n292\n00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:15,030\nthen it's going to generate a message on\nthat machine that came second, right.\n\n293\n00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,280\nAnd the machine that came second will\nbasically stop talking on the network so\n\n294\n00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,760\nthat it doesn't break the first machine,\nthe machine that was already up.\n\n295\n00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,736\nSo the machine we're looking at\nright here already had this IP.\n\n296\n00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,083\n>> 221.\n\n297\n00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,463\n>> No, it's 10.1.23201.\n\n298\n00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:30,464\n>> No, to, for the DHCP server?\n\n299\n00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:31,579\n>> Oh, you know what, no it isn't.\n\n300\n00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:32,360\nShoot, you're right.\n\n301\n00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,510\n221, right.\nWhere is that?\n\n302\n00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,030\nYep, up there.\n\n303\n00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,900\nI'm correcting you, and\nyou're the right one.\n\n304\n00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,370\nSo this machine has it so Ronnie,\nwhen he tried to change his IP,\n\n305\n00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,840\nhe got a message on his screen letting\nhim know that it's already in use.\n\n306\n00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,130\nOn this machine I don't even\nknow that that happened,\n\n307\n00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,410\nand that's nice because\nit's Windows machines.\n\n308\n00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,040\nWindows machines behaving and\noperating the way they should.\n\n309\n00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,450\nBut what if it's not a Windows\nmachine that causes the duplicate?\n\n310\n00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:00,970\nRight?\n\n311\n00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,980\nIf I bring up a Cisco router with this\nsame IP, well the duplicate IP is still\n\n312\n00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,640\ngoing to occur but\nit's gonna occur in a very malicious way\n\n313\n00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,600\nbecause it's not Windows on the machine\nthat's the infringing machine.\n\n314\n00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,380\nSo you'll get little pop-up bubbles\nthat'll appear that'll let you know\n\n315\n00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,400\na duplicate IP is on the network.\n\n316\n00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,690\nIdeally you go in you find the person\nthat did it and you fix it.\n\n317\n00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,670\nBut worst case scenario you can change\nyour IP to something different to get\n\n318\n00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,620\naround that but you know you do get nice\ngood diagnostics to pop up to let you know\n\n319\n00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,800\nthat that happened.\n\n320\n00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,030\nAnd in Windows, so did you go back to-\n>> I did.\n\n321\n00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,540\n>> What IP do you have now Ronnie?\n\n322\n00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,150\n>> Let's see.\n\n323\n00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,890\nOops.\n\n324\n00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,640\n>> Give me a second,\nit's coming back up here.\n\n325\n00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,490\nSo in Windows it's actually being pretty\nintelligent about a lot of this stuff too.\n\n326\n00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,294\nWhen you change your address,\nwhat's yours?\n\n327\n00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:52,435\n>> 230.26\n>> All right.\n\n328\n00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:55,790\nSo I'm gonna change mine to\nthe same as what Ronnie has.\n\n329\n00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,312\nSo I'm just gonna punch that in there.\n\n330\n00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:04,792\n[NOISE] And\nwe'll just do it back up like that.\n\n331\n00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:05,790\nAll right?\n\n332\n00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,950\nYou can actually choose to\nvalidate your settings upon exit.\n\n333\n00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,140\nAnd when you say okay to that,\nit's going to reach out and\n\n334\n00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,360\ncheck to see if that IP address\nis already in use on the network.\n\n335\n00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,610\nNow when I changed it,\nI'm remoted into this machine.\n\n336\n00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,610\nSo I just got disconnected.\n\n337\n00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,702\nSo let me fire up the console machine so\nI can show it to you.\n\n338\n00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:28,062\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] Did my whole?\n\n339\n00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:29,768\nNo it did, didn't it?\n\n340\n00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:30,590\nLet's see.\nWe're crazy.\n\n341\n00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,510\nIt's a virtual machine so\nI can connect to its console and\n\n342\n00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,970\nactually see what's on its screen.\n\n343\n00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:46,500\nAnd we should see a nice little message\nletting us know about the duplicate IP.\n\n344\n00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,146\nLet me just get into that real quick and\nwe'll all see it and\n\n345\n00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:52,764\nit should be sitting there waiting for us\nif not to make the error happen again but\n\n346\n00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:56,560\nit's cool because it gives you a chance\nto say oops, I didn't mean to do.\n\n347\n00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,001\nAnd let me undo the change that was made.\n\n348\n00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:03,434\nAnd I'm watching Ronnie's laptop over here\nand he has not received any warnings,\n\n349\n00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:07,890\nany messages, you wouldn't know there\nwas a duplicate IP on his machine.\n\n350\n00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,320\nBut here we go, on my end,\nI've got a message letting me know, hey,\n\n351\n00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,610\nthere's problems.\n\n352\n00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,500\nWould you like to try and fix them?\n\n353\n00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,940\nI could skip it, right, and\njust say no, don't fix my problems,\n\n354\n00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,250\nI'll deal with it myself.\n\n355\n00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,850\nHere it's warning me DACP is not enabled.\n\n356\n00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,100\nI'm okay with that,\nright, I don't want DACP.\n\n357\n00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,770\ni'm gonna pull these properties back\nup again to make sure it didn't fix\n\n358\n00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,970\nthe problem automatically.\n\n359\n00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,850\nThere we go, all right.\n\n360\n00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,680\nSo 1012326 is what's set.\n\n361\n00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,530\nAnd we say okay.\n\n362\n00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,270\nAnd now, I guess you can't really see it,\n\n363\n00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,240\nI've got my little network\nicon down in my system tray.\n\n364\n00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,100\nCan we full-screen this one, Jason?\n\n365\n00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,600\n>> There.\n>> Oh!\n\n366\n00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,200\nAlready done!\n\n367\n00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,890\nLook at that.\n\n368\n00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,870\nPay attention.\n\n369\n00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,780\nSo, I can see,\nI've got a little warning sign down\n\n370\n00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,810\nhere letting me know there is\na problem with my network adapter, and\n\n371\n00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,870\nit's basically telling me I have\nno network connections available.\n\n372\n00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,620\nAnd if I take a look at my IP\n\n373\n00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,480\naddress settings-\n>> Notice that?\n\n374\n00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,180\n>> Even though I statically\nassigned an address,\n\n375\n00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,340\nit's fallen back to using\na A PIPA address, right?\n\n376\n00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,670\nAutomatic Private IP Addressing.\n\n377\n00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,850\nSo it's trying to fix\nthat duplicate IP for\n\n378\n00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,070\nme, instead of breaking\nRonnie's laptop on the network.\n\n379\n00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:22,320\nAnd that's one of the cool\nthings about Window's 8.\n\n380\n00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,109\nA lot of people talk about Windows 8, but\nthey've really gone to extra steps inside\n\n381\n00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:31,696\nof there to make sure that it can fix some\nof its own problems so that you can't even\n\n382\n00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:35,492\nbreak it the same way that you\ncould previous versions of Windows.\n\n383\n00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:43,758\nI'll just put this one back to its own IP,\nand putting it back to its own IP,\n\n384\n00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:50,913\nit's gonna hopefully get happy again And\nso now I've got my normal address.\n\n385\n00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:54,010\nAnd I can get out to the Internet again.\n\n386\n00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,730\nAnd it's happy.\n\n387\n00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,230\n>> Very good.\n\n388\n00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,620\n>> All right.\nSo typos are a big thing.\n\n389\n00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,660\nAnother type of issue that can creep up\nis, maybe you can communicate to other\n\n390\n00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,870\nhosts locally on your network but\nyou can't communicate to people remotely.\n\n391\n00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,800\nAnd these are people that are not on the\nsame network as you that normally you'd\n\n392\n00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,660\npass through your default\ngateway to get to.\n\n393\n00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,750\n>> At this point, usually it's\na misconfigured default gateway\n\n394\n00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,620\na lot of times on your own machines.\n\n395\n00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,790\nAnd if you've been doing static to try and\ndo some testing on an individual machine,\n\n396\n00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,800\nand you planned on switching\nit back over to DHP,\n\n397\n00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,510\nI know I've done this before where\nI've said, okay, it's working and\n\n398\n00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,830\nwalked away and\nnot ever actually thought about it again.\n\n399\n00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,790\nAnd then somebody finally says oh,\nyou are doing that but\n\n400\n00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,380\nnow it's not working anymore.\n\n401\n00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,880\nI've taken that default gateway\noffline for one reason or another and\n\n402\n00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,570\nI can't know what I did.\n\n403\n00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,330\nYou have to go back to the machine and\ncheck that out.\n\n404\n00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,100\nEspecially if you've been\ndoing static configurations.\n\n405\n00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n406\n00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,090\nMy favorite is when you have a company\nthat has more than one network.\n\n407\n00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n408\n00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,552\nAnd somebody specifies\na default gateway that's\n\n409\n00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,314\nin a-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n410\n00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:56,416\n>> different network.\n\n411\n00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:01,049\nSo for example, if I go back in\nthe network settings on this machine, so\n\n412\n00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:05,705\nthis machine is on the 10.1.230 network,\nand it's a class C.\n\n413\n00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:09,791\nWe have another network here in\nthe building, which is 10.1.10, right?\n\n414\n00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:14,468\nSo this one is 10.1.230,\nand so I might come in and\n\n415\n00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:18,956\nsay, this machine is 10.1.230.221, and\n\n416\n00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:23,460\nthen the subnet mask is 255, 255, 255, 0.\n\n417\n00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,737\nAnd then the default gateway,\nI might say, well, you know what,\n\n418\n00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,580\nlet me go use the router\nthat's on the other network.\n\n419\n00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,891\nI'll put 10.1.10.1, okay?\n\n420\n00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:31,412\nIt's another network here in the building.\n\n421\n00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:32,800\nI wanna use that one.\n\n422\n00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,960\nWell, your default gateway,\n\n423\n00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,215\njust by definition has to be\non the same network as you.\n\n424\n00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:43,845\nYou cannot communicate to a host on\na different network without going\n\n425\n00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:47,715\nthrough a router, and if the router's\non a different network, then-\n\n426\n00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:48,385\n>> You can't do it.\n\n427\n00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:52,302\n>> Yeah, you're in one of those Catch 22,\nparadox,\n\n428\n00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:56,667\nwhatever, oxymoron, whatever the term is\nthat means that you just can't get there\n\n429\n00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,932\ncuz you need that system to get there.\n\n430\n00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,172\n>> We'll call it a burrito today.\n\n431\n00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:01,492\n>> A burrito, there we go.\n\n432\n00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,132\nSo you're in a networking burrito.\n\n433\n00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:05,532\nBut yeah, you just can't get there.\n\n434\n00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:10,560\nMaking sure that default gateway\nis on the same network as you and\n\n435\n00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,510\nyour subnet mass is what\nclues you in on that.\n\n436\n00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,540\nWhen I see a class C subnet mass like\nthis, 255.255.255.0, that tells me that,\n\n437\n00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,490\nwhere these 255s are,\nthose first three octets,\n\n438\n00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,000\nthey've got to match for somebody to be\non the same network as me so if I start\n\n439\n00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,640\nwith 10.1.2.30 my default gateway\nhas to start with 10.1.2.30 also.\n\n440\n00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,230\nThat last octet where there's\na zero in the subnet mask that can,\n\n441\n00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,660\nthat can be whatever, right?\n\n442\n00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,380\nBut the first three have to match and\nin my previous example there they didn't.\n\n443\n00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,650\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now your DNS servers,\n\n444\n00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,560\nthey can be wherever.\n\n445\n00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,120\nRight?\n\n446\n00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,800\nThey can be on any network.\n\n447\n00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,560\nIf they're on your local network,\nthat's great, fine.\n\n448\n00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,670\nMaybe you've got one right here\non the local network with you,\n\n449\n00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,990\nand if you're not going to the Internet\nyou may not even need a default gateway.\n\n450\n00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,450\nYou just have an IP in your DNS server.\n\n451\n00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,450\nBut more often then not we use DNS\nservers that are somewhere else,\n\n452\n00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,070\nlike here with Google, external,\nand so we can specify that, and\n\n453\n00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,880\nwe'll just go through our default\ngateway to get to that DNS server.\n\n454\n00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,760\nAll right, so those are some of\nthe things that can go wrong with IPV4.\n\n455\n00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,900\nThere's not a lot.\n\n456\n00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,881\n>> No.\n>> Because there's not a whole heck of\n\n457\n00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,854\na lot that we do on the client for iPV4.\n\n458\n00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:26,930\nIf you're using DACP there's a ton of\nstuff that can go wrong on the server.\n\n459\n00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,540\n>> Right.\n\n460\n00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,145\n>> But on the client side it's usually\njust typos, or misconfigurations.\n\n461\n00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:33,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n462\n00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,400\n>> Same thing really goes for IPv6.\n\n463\n00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,150\n>> Right.\n\n464\n00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,290\n>> In fact all the various things we\njust talked about are true in IPv6.\n\n465\n00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,370\nThe only big difference there is that you\nmay or may not actually use a DHTP server\n\n466\n00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:50,810\nwith IPv6, but if I go into my IPv6\nsettings, we'll see the same basic things.\n\n467\n00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,855\nObtain an IPv6 address off automatically\nor use the following static and\n\n468\n00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:59,855\nyou do address, subnet mask,\ndefault gateway, right?\n\n469\n00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:04,595\nAnd DNS servers you can be using DHCP but\nstill using\n\n470\n00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:09,925\nstatic DNS servers or you can go automatic\nall the way if you got a DHCP V6 server.\n\n471\n00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:14,035\nAll right, and you got your validate\nsettings upon exist really not any\n\n472\n00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:18,480\ndifferent so the same problems we have\nunder IPv4 you can have under IPv6.\n\n473\n00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,200\n>> Yeah.\n\n474\n00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,600\nDon't forget your good skills here in\nterms of using basic troubleshooting\n\n475\n00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,150\nutilities like your IP config,\nyour ping, your trace router\n\n476\n00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,670\nare really key in terms of you being out\nto to discover something information.\n\n477\n00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,640\nIf you don't have the chance\nto do anything else, right.\n\n478\n00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,380\nSo ping helps for basic connectivity,\n\n479\n00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,880\ntraceroute helps to see the path\nthat our data is going across.\n\n480\n00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,740\nIP config just helps to verify that\nwe have the proper information and\n\n481\n00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,940\nthat's the key one that we\nnormally do right away.\n\n482\n00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,305\n>> Well, why don't we do this?\n\n483\n00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:51,270\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break.\n\n484\n00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,790\n>> Okay.\n\n485\n00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,446\n>> When we get back, I want to talk\na little bit about Sub Nets, Because\n\n486\n00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:59,759\nthere's a couple of quirky little sub net\nquestions that can pop up on the exam.\n\n487\n00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,085\nAnd so I want a chance to talk about that\nand what you might see and then we'll move\n\n488\n00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,860\ninto some more interesting-\n>> Right.\n\n489\n00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,414\n>> Things to troubleshoot and networking\nissues we might have on our machines.\n\n490\n00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:13,054\nWe'll get to that after this.\n\n491\n00:23:13,054 --> 00:23:15,550\nSo stay tuned we'll be back in just a few.\n\n492\n00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:23,350\n[MUSIC]\n\n493\n00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,776\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n494\n00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:29,276\nSo I wanted to take a minute to\ntake a look at some subnets, and\n\n495\n00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:32,571\nsome of the tricky things that\nwe can expect to see, now,\n\n496\n00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:37,533\nif you're a long-time ITProTV viewer,\nyou've probably been subnetted to death.\n\n497\n00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:38,253\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n498\n00:23:38,253 --> 00:23:42,122\n>> And if you've watched some of the SYSCO\nshows or the network plus show or\n\n499\n00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:45,875\neven the A+ show, we talk about\nsubnets and how important they are.\n\n500\n00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:51,480\nSo when it comes to troubleshooting,\nthose subnets are doubly important.\n\n501\n00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,125\n>> Right.\n\n502\n00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:56,331\n>> So I don't want to rehash old\nground and cover what VLSM is and\n\n503\n00:23:56,331 --> 00:24:01,300\nall that stuff, but I want to cover\nthis from a troubleshooting angle.\n\n504\n00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,115\nHow we can spot problems\nin our addresses based on.\n\n505\n00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:06,725\nOn the subnet masks and\nsubnets are being used.\n\n506\n00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:07,515\n>> Yep.\n\n507\n00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:10,605\n>> All right, so\nlet's fire up just an example here.\n\n508\n00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:16,789\nWhen we assign an IP address to our\nmachine, we assign a subnet mask.\n\n509\n00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,832\nAnd I Mention before the break\nthat the IP address of our gateway\n\n510\n00:24:21,832 --> 00:24:26,222\nneeds to be in the same\nnetwork as our host, right?\n\n511\n00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:29,682\nBut depending on our subnet mask that\ngateway may or may not be in there, right?\n\n512\n00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:37,016\nSo for example,\nlet's say that my IP is 192.160.0.100.\n\n513\n00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:38,016\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n514\n00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:41,715\n>> Okay, and my subnet mask is.\n\n515\n00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:45,527\n255.255.255.0, all right?\n\n516\n00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:53,526\nAnd my default gateway is 192.168.1.1,\nokay?\n\n517\n00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:59,910\nWell, when I look at this,\nis this going to be a valid configuration.\n\n518\n00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,080\nAm I going to be able to\nuse this default gateway.\n\n519\n00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,570\nRight?\nAnd what we\n\n520\n00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,510\nshould be able to do is look at this\nat a glance and just say, all right.\n\n521\n00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,455\nWell, the first three octets\nare in the network id.\n\n522\n00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:10,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n523\n00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,830\n>> Do the first three octets match?\n\n524\n00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,600\nAnd in this case, they don't.\n\n525\n00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,120\n>> They don't.\n\n526\n00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,620\n>> Right?\n\n527\n00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,510\nSo I can quickly and\neasily spot that that's a mismatch.\n\n528\n00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,700\nThis isn't going to work.\n\n529\n00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,300\nAnd I'm gonna have to\nmake a change to fix it.\n\n530\n00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,650\n>> Right.\n>> But if we just change that subnet mask.\n\n531\n00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,320\nIf we make that subnet mask\nsomething like that, okay yeah,\n\n532\n00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,760\nnow are they in the same network?\n\n533\n00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,540\nYes, yes they are right?\n\n534\n00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:40,180\nSo I've got 255.255.0.0 that means the\nfirst two octets are in the network idea.\n\n535\n00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,580\nSo just the first two octets have to much,\nand sure enough they do.\n\n536\n00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,265\nAlright?\n\n537\n00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:50,779\nJust because I see 192.68 on the exam,\nI shouldn't assume that\n\n538\n00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:56,863\nthey're gonna use a class C subnet\nmask 2552552550 subnet mask.\n\n539\n00:25:56,863 --> 00:25:58,732\nCause they can assign whatever they want.\n\n540\n00:25:58,732 --> 00:25:59,550\nRight?\n\n541\n00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,570\nSo we need to be able to look and\nrecognize that.\n\n542\n00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,780\nAnd when their standard subnet masks like\n\n543\n00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,980\nthese-\n>> Easy enough.\n\n544\n00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,750\n>> It is, it's pretty easy.\n\n545\n00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,070\nBut what about when they're\nnon-standard subnet masks, right?\n\n546\n00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,456\nWhat if I give you an IP scheme\nthat's a little bit different, right?\n\n547\n00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:23,644\nLet's say that was my IP and\n\n548\n00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:29,980\nthere, alright?\n\n549\n00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:36,600\nSo let's say this was my IP address and\nsubnet mask and default gateway, okay?\n\n550\n00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,220\nWell my subnet mask is\n255.255.255.255.240.\n\n551\n00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,680\nIs the IP address of my host and\n\n552\n00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,020\nthe subnet mask are they\nin the same network.\n\n553\n00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,300\n>> No, they would not be in the same.\n\n554\n00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,390\n>> If you're like Ronnie\n>> Yep.\n\n555\n00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:58,240\n>> With a natural aptitude for translating\nbinary to decimal and so on in your head,\n\n556\n00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,810\nit very easy to tell that these two\nare not going to be in the same network.\n\n557\n00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,600\nRight?\n\n558\n00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,370\nBut if you're like me,\nyou might look at it and say I don't know.\n\n559\n00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,360\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know.\n\n560\n00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,760\nOr here, let's have a little more fun.\n\n561\n00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,180\nLet's make these numbers\na little bit closer.\n\n562\n00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,130\nLet's say that it was this.\n\n563\n00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,120\nOkay?\n\n564\n00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,390\nSo, Ronnie, do you know this\none off the top of your head?\n\n565\n00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,330\n>> I'd have to work out the math.\n\n566\n00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,280\n>> Yeah.\nThat was my goal.\n\n567\n00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,890\nI tried to stump Ronnie here.\n\n568\n00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,700\nRonnie, and again if you guys\nhave watched the other shows,\n\n569\n00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,390\nRonnie is phenomenal at translating\nbinary to decimal and back and forth.\n\n570\n00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,960\nAnd he does it much quicker than I do.\n\n571\n00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,890\nSo, I'm always proud when I can pick\none that's a little bit harder.\n\n572\n00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,500\nSo, if you get\na configuration like this and\n\n573\n00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,330\nin the question it's saying the host\ncan't reach the default gateway.\n\n574\n00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,170\nThey can't get to the internet or\nwhatever, where's our problem?\n\n575\n00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,390\nIt's hard to say.\n\n576\n00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,330\nThis actually could be a good\nconfiguration, I'm not sure.\n\n577\n00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,090\nSo we need to find out and\nto find out, there's some quick ways,\n\n578\n00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,970\nsome ways we can do to shave a little\ntime off from the exam and stuff, for\n\n579\n00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,880\nexample In the subnet mask I see 255,\n\n580\n00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,490\n255, 255 for the first three octets, so I\nknow the first three octets have to match.\n\n581\n00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,290\nAnd if I look, 1921680 and I've got\n1921680 here, so they do match, for\n\n582\n00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,390\nthe first three.\n\n583\n00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,130\nSo the first three octets I\nreally don't have to mess with.\n\n584\n00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,430\nIt's really just that fourth one.\n\n585\n00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:24,330\nI've got 97 up here, I've got 91\ndown here, and I've got 240 here.\n\n586\n00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:28,730\nI don't really know if these guys\nare in the same network or not, right?\n\n587\n00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:32,040\nSo we are gonna have to do\na little bit of a conversion.\n\n588\n00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:37,050\nSo if we come out and\nwe say like, we're gonna take 97,\n\n589\n00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:42,060\nwe'll take 240 and\n\n590\n00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:48,330\nwe'll take 91 and\nwe're going to convert them into binary.\n\n591\n00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:48,850\nRight?\n>> Hm.\n\n592\n00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,280\n>> And then binary,\nwe'll be able to quickly and\n\n593\n00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,440\neasily spot whether these guys\nare in the same network, right?\n\n594\n00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,749\nSo now the fun part.\n\n595\n00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,380\nWhat is 97 in binary?\n\n596\n00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,530\nWell, [LAUGH], on the exam you will\nhave access to the Windows calculator.\n\n597\n00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,700\nOr, I have heard some test\ncenters not having it,\n\n598\n00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,510\nbut most of them will have\nthe Windows calculator available.\n\n599\n00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,420\nBut it will not have the scientific\nprogrammer modes available, so\n\n600\n00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,620\nyou won't be able to use the calculator\nto do these conversions.\n\n601\n00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,870\nYou're expected to do them in your head.\n\n602\n00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,070\nSo I use my old school method that's\nnot necessarily the most efficient but\n\n603\n00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,260\nit works for me.\n\n604\n00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,860\nYou guys are welcome to use\nwhatever method that works for you.\n\n605\n00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,960\nBut I always thing of the 8 bits of\nthe octet as a placeholder for values.\n\n606\n00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,840\n128 all the way down to 1 And\nso I use that for\n\n607\n00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,130\nmy math and\nI basically come through and I say,\n\n608\n00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:44,010\nfor example, 97 is less than 128 but\nit's bigger than 64.\n\n609\n00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,610\nSo I need that 64.\n\n610\n00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,430\nAnd so if I say, 97 minus 64 Equals,\n\n611\n00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,940\nwhat is that, 33?\n\n612\n00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,470\nAlright.\n\n613\n00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,370\n33 is bigger than 32, so\nI'll subtract 32 which equals 1.\n\n614\n00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,290\n1 is smaller than 16, smaller than 8,\n\n615\n00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:07,880\nsmaller than 4, smaller than 2,\nbut equal to 1.\n\n616\n00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,176\nSo there is 97 written in binary.\n\n617\n00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,430\nIt's 0 1 1.\n\n618\n00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,670\n00001, all right?\n\n619\n00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:20,980\n240's a little bit easier, because it is\n>> Four ones, now?\n\n620\n00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,396\n>> Yeah, when you deal with a subnet mask,\nall the ones are to the left, and\n\n621\n00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:27,588\nall the zeroes are to the right, so\nit makes it where there's only so\n\n622\n00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:29,395\nmany combinations you can pick from.\n\n623\n00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:33,296\nBut if I did 128 plus 64 is 192.\n\n624\n00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:35,572\nPlus 32 is 224.\n\n625\n00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:39,063\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Plus 16 is 240.\n\n626\n00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:40,730\nSo I can work that out.\n\n627\n00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,142\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n628\n00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:44,190\n>> And then 91.\n\n629\n00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,570\n91 is gonna be similar to\nwhat we did a minute ago.\n\n630\n00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,340\n91 minus 64, cuz I'll need 64.\n\n631\n00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,846\nAnd then that is going to be 27?\n\n632\n00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:54,224\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n633\n00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:59,110\n>> All right, so\nas I go down the list here I needed 64\n\n634\n00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,070\n>> 27 is smaller than 32, so\n\n635\n00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,450\nI don't need it, but\nit's bigger than 16, and\n\n636\n00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,530\nthat right there tells me there's going\nto be a difference in the binary.\n\n637\n00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,290\nWe'll go ahead and\nwork it all out for completeness.\n\n638\n00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:15,850\nThere's your 11, which is bigger than 8,\n\n639\n00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:20,206\nwhich is smaller than 4,\nbut bigger than 2.\n\n640\n00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,800\nAnd, then we'll carry\nthat all the way out.\n\n641\n00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,390\nI guess I really should\nhave done that in here too.\n\n642\n00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,210\nOkay?\nAll right?\n\n643\n00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,940\nSo the end result is that 91\nin binary is 01011011, right.\n\n644\n00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,250\nNow the subnet mask,\nthe first 4 bits were all 1s, and\n\n645\n00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,208\nso if I draw a line\n>> Where those ones end.\n\n646\n00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,417\nAll right?\n\n647\n00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:56,584\nIf these hosts were on the same network.\n\n648\n00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:57,440\n>> It would match.\n\n649\n00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,350\n>> The first four bits\nwould have to match.\n\n650\n00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:04,950\nAnd I've got 0110 on the top one and\n0101 on the bottom one.\n\n651\n00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,190\nThey do not match the,\nthey're really close.\n\n652\n00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,530\nBut they don't match.\n\n653\n00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,360\nSo that means that this is\nactually a bad configuration.\n\n654\n00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,690\nBut I couldn't tell at a glance.\n\n655\n00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,680\nI couldn't tell just by looking at it.\n\n656\n00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,060\nYou guys do a little work.\n\n657\n00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,320\n>> Looks good.\n\n658\n00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,500\n>> All right.\nAnother example,\n\n659\n00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,290\nRonnie mentioned one during the break.\n\n660\n00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,230\nWe actually have right\nhere in the building,\n\n661\n00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,210\nI know we've used in other\nexamples on the show but\n\n662\n00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,620\nbut we have a network here to tend out one\nDOT one hundred network that we use for\n\n663\n00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,760\nsome of our guest machines and our\nvisitors and stuff like that and we run\n\n664\n00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,780\nout of IP is one of the few times a week\nwe run a custom network on only this one.\n\n665\n00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,417\nSo, I might have a machine\non my network here that\n\n666\n00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:51,539\nhas an IP address of something like that.\n\n667\n00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,570\nThere we go.\n\n668\n00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:07,897\nWith a gateway of that,\nand a subnet mask of that.\n\n669\n00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:09,328\nAll right?\n\n670\n00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:13,090\nAnd looking at these guys,\n\n671\n00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,520\nnow I've got to find out whether\nthey're on the same network or not.\n\n672\n00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,690\nNow, the subnet mask starts with 255 255,\n\n673\n00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,838\nand both of these addresses\nstart with 10 dot 1.\n\n674\n00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:23,640\nOkay?\n\n675\n00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,350\nSo because they've also written out\none of them is a pretty good match.\n\n676\n00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,820\nBut this one here.\n\n677\n00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,830\nTwo five four right.\n\n678\n00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,150\nThat's not a normal number\nit's not the entire octet so\n\n679\n00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,835\nis one hundred one and\none hundred are they on the same network.\n\n680\n00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:42,925\nIt's hard to say right now Ronnie I know\nyou can do this when your head but for\n\n681\n00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:47,740\nthe rest of us for the normal people\naround here who want to figure it\n\n682\n00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,700\nout, we'll need to do\na little bit of work.\n\n683\n00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,030\nAnd, I wrote them in a different order\nthan I did in the last examples.\n\n684\n00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,814\nLet me rearrange that, there.\n\n685\n00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:04,290\nAll right.\n\n686\n00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,760\nSo we're going to have to convert\nthese numbers into binary.\n\n687\n00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,920\nFortunately they're really close numbers,\nand\n\n688\n00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,500\nso it will make the with\nmath is somewhat short.\n\n689\n00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,470\nStarting with 101,\nI know I don't need 128, but I do need 64.\n\n690\n00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,110\nRight?\n\n691\n00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,802\nSo 101 minus 64 is 37.\n\n692\n00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:24,880\nAll right.\n\n693\n00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,290\n[LAUGH]\nSo it's 37, which is bigger than 32, so\n\n694\n00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,500\nI'm going to need that one.\n\n695\n00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,230\nSo 37 minus 32 is 5.\n\n696\n00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,310\nSo I don't need 16,\nI don't need 8, I do need 4,\n\n697\n00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:43,400\ndon't need to I do need one not as\none hundred one in binary to five for\n\n698\n00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,230\nsuper easy right because two five was\na big number the biggest number you can\n\n699\n00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,250\nwrite in eight bits is two hundred\nfifty five this is one last.\n\n700\n00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,580\nSo that's a great indicator that I\nneed everything except for the one.\n\n701\n00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:02,230\nAnd then one hundred is just one less than\none o one so I know I don't need this\n\n702\n00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:07,979\none bit here at the end and so\nI can just write it out as that.\n\n703\n00:35:07,979 --> 00:35:09,540\nAll right?\n\n704\n00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,870\nAnd if I draw my line\nlike I did before where\n\n705\n00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:18,010\nthe address changes where the ones\nstop and the zeroes start.\n\n706\n00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,070\nAnd that sub net mask we can\nsketch it right in there.\n\n707\n00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,020\n>> And there you go.\n\n708\n00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,860\n>> And I can see.\n\n709\n00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,770\n>> It's a big match.\n\n710\n00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,130\n>> To the left of that\nline we've got a match.\n\n711\n00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,010\nRight they both start with\n0110010 that's great,\n\n712\n00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,660\nyou know we got a match,\nthese are on the same network.\n\n713\n00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,200\nAt a glance you see 10.1.101.211,\nand 10.1.100.1,\n\n714\n00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,380\nit's real easy to think these guys\nare on two different networks,\n\n715\n00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,890\nbut because the subnet mask\nthey're on the same network.\n\n716\n00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,710\n>> Now you may be thinking for\n\n717\n00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,680\nthe purpose of the exam, there's no\nway I'm going to have time to do this.\n\n718\n00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,000\nBut usually,\neven though you don't feel like it,\n\n719\n00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,130\nyou're going to have time to be able\nto do some of these conversions.\n\n720\n00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,170\nAnd you don't have to convert\nthe entire IP address.\n\n721\n00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,710\nWe'll notice what we did here is we only\nactually looked at that one octet there,\n\n722\n00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,410\nand we said, hey, let's just do this\nconversion relatively quickly here.\n\n723\n00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,530\nBut it is very easy to\njust get into a rush.\n\n724\n00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,100\nNo and no.\n\n725\n00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,860\nI see those two different numbers, 100,\n101, they're not on the same network and\n\n726\n00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,360\nglance by it.\n\n727\n00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,460\nAnd this is a relatively easy\nquestion that you could get right.\n\n728\n00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,320\nAnd so you don't even have\nto guess at this, right?\n\n729\n00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,410\nYou work the math out it works.\n\n730\n00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:29,830\n>> The Microsoft exams, you normally get\na good 2 1/2 hours, sometimes three or\n\n731\n00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:34,250\nfour hours on some exams so my job is\nreally fair about giving you enough time.\n\n732\n00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,450\nThe other thing to remember is\nthat you can mark a question and\n\n733\n00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,720\ncome back to it later.\n\n734\n00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,990\nSo if you're worried about burning\ntoo much time on a question like this\n\n735\n00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,840\nwhen you see a subnet question just mark\nit for review and skip over, all right?\n\n736\n00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,310\nThat way you can go through\nthe whole rest of the exam and\n\n737\n00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,180\nwhen you're done, then you can come back\nand do these that you are worried about\n\n738\n00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,800\nbeing time consuming and\nif they are time consuming that's\n\n739\n00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,340\nfine because you've already done the rest\nof the exam and now you can go back and\n\n740\n00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,970\ntake your time on these and get as much\ndone as you can before your time runs out.\n\n741\n00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:04,900\nSo you know just you do smart\ntesting right smart arrangement.\n\n742\n00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,950\nThey're not trying to test you on how well\nyou take tests they're trying to test you\n\n743\n00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,840\non how well you know your content so.\n\n744\n00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,530\nSo if you have to jump around\nthe questions that's probably fine\n\n745\n00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:19,400\nif I don't talk to you for\nthat, unlike Cisco.\n\n746\n00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,200\nCisco barely gives you enough time and\nthey're really strict.\n\n747\n00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,870\nYou're not able to jump around in\nquestions but Microsoft you can so\n\n748\n00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,680\ntake advantage of that.\n\n749\n00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,680\nAll right, so subnet masks are important.\n\n750\n00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,650\nThat's the big thing there and\n\n751\n00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,550\non the exam you'll see questions that pop\nup about that and just kind of verifying,\n\n752\n00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,590\nit's one of the key trouble\nthings that you'll bump into.\n\n753\n00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,940\nAnother thing worth mentioning, in almost\nevery textbook, and even in here on\n\n754\n00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,030\nthe show, we have a habit of placing\nour default gateways at dot one.\n\n755\n00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,880\nRight, that first IP on a network,\nand that's because your\n\n756\n00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,610\ndefault gateway is normally the first\ndevice that you bring online, so\n\n757\n00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,880\nwe just had a habit to give it a dot one.\n\n758\n00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,260\nIt is simply a matter of habit, though.\n\n759\n00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,440\nThere's no rule, or standard, or\n\n760\n00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,170\nanything like that that says\nyour router has to be not one.\n\n761\n00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,720\nYour router can have whatever\nIP address it wants.\n\n762\n00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,850\nSo you can have a router that says at at\n0.73.254, you know, it could be whatever.\n\n763\n00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:16,660\nSo, on the exams, if you see a default\ngateway that doesn't end in .1,\n\n764\n00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,170\ndon't automatically\nassume that it's wrong.\n\n765\n00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,590\nIt's a valid IP.\n\n766\n00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:26,320\nIf it ends in .0 or .255,\nthen you need to be a little suspect.\n\n767\n00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,430\nBut even then,\nsometimes it's okay to have a .0.\n\n768\n00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:30,960\nAll right.\n\n769\n00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,410\nLet me give you an example of that,\nbecause a Windows station,\n\n770\n00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:39,100\nMicrosoft supports this, can make use of\nIPs that we wouldn't normally think of.\n\n771\n00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,470\nThis network that we just did, right?\n\n772\n00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,580\nTechnically that network starts.\n\n773\n00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,540\nLike if we do the first usable,\nlast usable address calculation you\n\n774\n00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,400\nknow that whole thing,\nwhere here would do the whole thing so\n\n775\n00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,910\nyou know you got your first usable IP.\n\n776\n00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,010\nYou've got your subnet ID.\n\n777\n00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,380\nYou've got your last usable IP.\n\n778\n00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,300\nAnd you've got your broadcast ID.\n\n779\n00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,690\nEvery network has these four entities\nright, that we need to know.\n\n780\n00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:18,140\nThe subnet ID being the very\nfirst address on the network.\n\n781\n00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,250\nThe first usable being the first address\nthat we can actually assign to a machine.\n\n782\n00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,350\nThe last usable being, well the last\none we can assign to a machine.\n\n783\n00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:30,136\nAnd a broadcast being the address we\nuse when we want to communicate to\n\n784\n00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:32,706\neverybody on the network all right?\n\n785\n00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:36,349\nIn this network above it's\n10.1.100 is the beginning.\n\n786\n00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,269\nAnd the subnet\n\n787\n00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:50,083\nmask on that one.\n\n788\n00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:53,328\nThere.\nSo there's our subnet mass, it's 255, 255,\n\n789\n00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:58,260\n254, right, that last bit there is a 0,\nand then 0, that's the subnet mass.\n\n790\n00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,640\nAnd the network,\nit started in the 10-1-100 range, and\n\n791\n00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,480\nit went all the way up\nto the 10-1-101 range.\n\n792\n00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,600\nSo, I started at 10.1.100.0, and\n\n793\n00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,457\nif I wanna write that in binary,\nI would need\n\n794\n00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:20,856\nthe 8-bit and the 2-bit, so there's 10.\n\n795\n00:40:20,856 --> 00:40:21,901\nIs that too many zeros?\n\n796\n00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:23,097\nThat looks like too many zeros.\n\n797\n00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:24,537\n>> Yeah, I think that's right.\n\n798\n00:40:24,537 --> 00:40:26,170\n>> It is, all right.\n\n799\n00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,582\nOptical illusion or something.\n\n800\n00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:30,770\nAnd then I've already got this\none converted from before.\n\n801\n00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,751\nOh, no.\nNo, I don't.\n\n802\n00:40:32,751 --> 00:40:34,864\n>> You can do it up above.\n\n803\n00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:40,030\nLet's see, is that 100?\n\n804\n00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,582\n>> Yep.\n\n805\n00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:42,787\n>> Yes, okay.\n\n806\n00:40:42,787 --> 00:40:44,190\nGonna get Ronnie to fact check me.\n\n807\n00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,178\nAll right, so when we go to figure\nout things like our first usable,\n\n808\n00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:51,803\nour last usable,\nwhat we have to pay attention to\n\n809\n00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:55,340\nis where the ones in our subnet stop and\nthe zeroes start, right?\n\n810\n00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,310\nEverything that has a 1, that's gonna\nmatch for all of these addresses, right?\n\n811\n00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,630\nEverything that corresponds\nto the 1 in the subnet mask.\n\n812\n00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,160\nAnd so I know my first 23 bits.\n\n813\n00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,124\nIt's the remaining bits that change.\n\n814\n00:41:10,124 --> 00:41:15,570\nIn the first usable address,\nwe'll have all 0s and a 1.\n\n815\n00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,150\nThe last usable address\nwill have all 1s and a 0.\n\n816\n00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,770\nAnd the broadcast will have all 1s\ncorresponding to where there's 0s\n\n817\n00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,510\nin the subnet mask.\n\n818\n00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,470\nAnd we can take that\ninformation right there and\n\n819\n00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:34,610\nwe can use that to figure out\nwhat that subnet ID is and so on.\n\n820\n00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,580\nI already know the subnet ID,\nwhich is that,\n\n821\n00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,238\nthe first usable, the last usable,\n\n822\n00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:48,770\nand the broadcast.\n\n823\n00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,020\nAll right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n824\n00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,048\n>> Now, [LAUGH] you might ask yourself,\n\n825\n00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:00,150\ngreat, Don,\nwhy did you bother showing us all that?\n\n826\n00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,636\nWell, what I wanted to show you was,\n\n827\n00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:08,813\nthe first usable address is 10.1.100.1 and\n\n828\n00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:14,234\nit goes all the way through 10.1.101.254.\n\n829\n00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:19,646\nIn between them is 10.1.101.\n\n830\n00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:25,466\n>> 0.\n\n831\n00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:26,050\nYep.\n\n832\n00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,740\n>> Those two addresses right there,\nall right.\n\n833\n00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,850\nNow, if you sat down at a machine and\nlooked at it,\n\n834\n00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:35,470\nand it had an IP address of 10.1.100.255,\nwhat's your first thought?\n\n835\n00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,032\n>> Broadcast.\n\n836\n00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:38,402\n>> Somebody screwed,\nup that's a broadcast address.\n\n837\n00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:42,788\nOr if you sat down on a machine and\nit had an IP address of 10.1.101.0,\n\n838\n00:42:42,788 --> 00:42:44,761\nwhat's your first thought there?\n\n839\n00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:47,219\nSomebody screwed up, that's a subnet ID.\n\n840\n00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:50,212\nRight, you'd never have\nsomething end in a 0.\n\n841\n00:42:50,212 --> 00:42:52,383\nBut the reality is you can.\n\n842\n00:42:52,383 --> 00:42:57,137\nIn this network above,\nbecause that eighth bit of\n\n843\n00:42:57,137 --> 00:43:01,158\nthe third octet is a part of the host ID-\n>> You can do it, yep.\n\n844\n00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:03,650\n>> You can absolutely do it.\n\n845\n00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:09,904\nAnd so these would not fit their\ntraditional broadcast model or\n\n846\n00:43:09,904 --> 00:43:16,991\nthe traditional subnet ID,\nthe host ID wouldn't be all 0s or all 1s.\n\n847\n00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:23,869\nIn fact, in this example here, the host\nID would be 0., and then eight 1s.\n\n848\n00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:31,542\nAnd here, the host ID would be 1.,\nand all 0s, so it's not all 0s.\n\n849\n00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,372\nThere's a 1 at the beginning of it, and so\n\n850\n00:43:34,372 --> 00:43:38,315\nthese are valid IPs that you\ncould assign to a work station.\n\n851\n00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,177\nSo on the exam,\nif you see a machine that ends in .255, or\n\n852\n00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:44,166\na machine that ends in .0,\ndon't immediately discount it.\n\n853\n00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,891\nIt could be a valid address and\n\n854\n00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:49,281\nyou'll only know by looking\nat that subnet mask, right?\n\n855\n00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:53,074\nYou've gotta have that\nsubnet mask to tell.\n\n856\n00:43:53,074 --> 00:43:58,158\nAll right, Ronnie, I think that's\nabout all I've got on subnets.\n\n857\n00:43:58,158 --> 00:44:00,620\nCan you think of anything else\nworth mentioning on that one?\n\n858\n00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,260\n>> Not on subnets, yeah, good coverage.\n\n859\n00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,670\n>> Keep in mind,\nyou do have subnet masks with IPv6,\n\n860\n00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:11,890\nexcept we don't worry about it so\nmuch because the IPv6 address space is so\n\n861\n00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,510\nbig that we almost always just use a \\64.\n\n862\n00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:20,070\nAnd on the exam you're pretty much gonna\nsee \\64s and that's it, and so as long as\n\n863\n00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,970\nthe first 64 bits match between you and\nyour gateway, then you're in business.\n\n864\n00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,370\nBut it's the same concept.\n\n865\n00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,342\nThere's the first part of the network ID,\nit's gotta match for\n\n866\n00:44:28,342 --> 00:44:31,290\nyou to talk to that host,\nincluding your default gateway.\n\n867\n00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,150\n>> All right.\n\n868\n00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,540\n>> So.\n\n869\n00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,320\nAll right, well, why don't we do this?\n\n870\n00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,320\nWhy don't we stop and take a break,\nand when we get back we're gonna\n\n871\n00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,432\ntake a look at some other things that\nare a little more exciting, in my opinion.\n\n872\n00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:48,520\nWe're gonna look at some name resolution\nissues, what else we got on that table?\n\n873\n00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,002\n>> Some wireless network connection,\noh, you wanna know something,\n\n874\n00:44:51,002 --> 00:44:53,550\nwe forgot to mention some transitional\ntechnologies here at the end.\n\n875\n00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,210\nDo we wanna?\n\n876\n00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,780\n>> We do have just a minute or\ntwo here, we can jump into that.\n\n877\n00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,089\nSo you wanna tackle it or you want me to?\n\n878\n00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:02,339\nLet's talk about, there's a couple\nof different technologies.\n\n879\n00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:07,065\nSince we're running IP version 4, as well\nas IP version 6, that you can actually see\n\n880\n00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:11,338\nthat you're gonna have IP version 6\nhosted on an IP version 4 network, and so\n\n881\n00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:15,516\nyou still have to actually be able to\nsend traffic even though that happens.\n\n882\n00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:18,325\nThere's two technologies that we\ncall transitional technologies.\n\n883\n00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:22,443\nOne's called ISATAP,\nspelled exactly like it sounds, strangely,\n\n884\n00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:27,329\nI-S-A-T-A-P, and the other one's called\nTeredo is what it's called here,\n\n885\n00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:29,730\nand both those do have issues with them.\n\n886\n00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:34,128\nBut there's really not a lot I can\ndo on my end in supporting an actual\n\n887\n00:45:34,128 --> 00:45:38,570\nregular Windows 8 machine that\nI can really do anything about.\n\n888\n00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,800\n>> Yeah, both of those technologies,\nTeredo tunnels and ISATAP tunnels,\n\n889\n00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,010\ntheir design when you've got some\nof your machines running IPv6 and\n\n890\n00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,430\nsome of your machines running IPv4, or\nyou've got all your machines running IPv6,\n\n891\n00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:55,090\nbut there's an IPv4 network in\nbetween them like the Internet.\n\n892\n00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:59,910\nSo, ISATAP and Teredo tunnels, they\nallow you to take your IPv6 traffic, and\n\n893\n00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,055\nsend it across IPv4 networks, right?\n\n894\n00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:07,120\nWell, they're both designed to be\nfairly seamless to the client.\n\n895\n00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,636\nSo on the end station side, on your\nlaptop or your desktop or whatever,\n\n896\n00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:15,975\nthere's not really much to configure or\ntroubleshoot.\n\n897\n00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:19,320\nISATAP uses DNS entries to be\nable to discover the server and\n\n898\n00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,660\nroute things along, Teredo tunnels\nuse policies that are assigned and\n\n899\n00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,730\na Teredo proxy on the Internet\nto communicate with, so\n\n900\n00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,290\nthere's a lot to troubleshoot there,\nright?\n\n901\n00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,360\nBut on the client side,\nthere's not much to deal with.\n\n902\n00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,280\nThe thing we need to remember for\nthe exam is that these exist,\n\n903\n00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,040\nthat there are Teredo tunnels,\nthat there are ISATAP tunnels.\n\n904\n00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,230\nAnd that, if we wanna send IPv6 traffic\n\n905\n00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:43,220\nacross an IPv4 network,\nwe can't just do it.\n\n906\n00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,490\nWe can't just throw\nthe stuff right out there.\n\n907\n00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:50,226\nWe either need to use a 6 to 4 tunnel,\nor an ISATAP tunnel or Teredo tunnel,\n\n908\n00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:51,480\nall right?\n\n909\n00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,070\nNow, if you wanna learn more about those,\nit's a little bit beyond the scope of\n\n910\n00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,798\na client certification exam,so we're not\ngonna dive into them in this show, but\n\n911\n00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:04,109\nas an IT Pro TV member,\nit's part of your subscription.\n\n912\n00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:07,515\nYou can jump over to\nthe Windows Server 2012 show and\n\n913\n00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:09,988\nis it the 7410 exam or the 7411?\n\n914\n00:47:09,988 --> 00:47:12,949\n>> 7410.\n>> Okay, if you jump over to the 7410\n\n915\n00:47:12,949 --> 00:47:16,896\nshow, we cover in that one how\nto set up an ISATAP router,\n\n916\n00:47:16,896 --> 00:47:22,277\nhow to set up a Teredo tunnel, and how\nto get that configured and how it works.\n\n917\n00:47:22,277 --> 00:47:23,940\nIt's a lot of steps.\n\n918\n00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,080\nIt is not easy.\n\n919\n00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,050\nThey're both horrible technologies,\nbut they're kind of essential.\n\n920\n00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:33,167\nWe need them as a transition as we\nstart to make the move over to IPv6.\n\n921\n00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:37,038\nFive years from now, IPv6 will be\nprevalent and no one will use ISATAP and\n\n922\n00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:38,417\nTeredo Tunnels anymore.\n\n923\n00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:39,375\nThey'll be gone, right?\n\n924\n00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:40,875\nSo they're very temporary.\n\n925\n00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,833\nThey're just to help us\nmake that switch over.\n\n926\n00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,167\n>> Right.\n\n927\n00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:46,925\nAll right.\nYou think of anything else to throw in\n\n928\n00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:47,458\nthere?\n\n929\n00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,720\n>> Nope, not before we head\ninto the name resolution.\n\n930\n00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,880\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, let's stop and take a break.\n\n931\n00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,930\nWhen we get back we've got name\nresolution, we've got wireless stuff and\n\n932\n00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,560\nwe've got network security, right?\n\n933\n00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,150\n>> Yeah, network security.\n\n934\n00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,695\n>> Firewalls and IPsec, all coming\nup in the second half of the show,\n\n935\n00:47:59,695 --> 00:48:01,260\nso stay tuned for that.\n\n936\n00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,326\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n937\n00:48:02,326 --> 00:48:05,330\n[MUSIC]\n\n938\n00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:11,120\n[SOUND]\nAll right.\n\n939\n00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,320\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n940\n00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,190\nSo we're gonna switch gears a little bit.\n\n941\n00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:18,160\nAnd now we're gonna take a look at name\nresolution and some of the problems that\n\n942\n00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,170\ncan cause us not to be able to,\nwell I say connect to somebody by name.\n\n943\n00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,680\n>> Right.\n>> But, even to just look somebody\n\n944\n00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,540\nup by name, in some cases.\n\n945\n00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,120\n>> Yeah.\n\n946\n00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,540\nName resolution, for us,\nis a huge technology,\n\n947\n00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,040\nespecially in the world of networking,\nright?\n\n948\n00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,600\nHardly do we ever actually just depend\non IP addresses for everything.\n\n949\n00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,450\nWe do depend on names for everything,\n\n950\n00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,450\nand we do depend on\nthe process of name resolution.\n\n951\n00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,150\nSo, when you hear about terms like DNS,\nthat, that is huge.\n\n952\n00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,500\nThat's such a gigantic topic.\n\n953\n00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,590\nIt's one of the biggest topics you'll\never cover in terms of Microsoft exams.\n\n954\n00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:54,790\nBut then, because we're also transitioning\ninto IP version 6, you're going to hear\n\n955\n00:48:54,790 --> 00:49:01,000\nabout new topics as well,\nsuch as PNRP, peer name resolution.\n\n956\n00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,550\n>> People's national republic of\n>> Yeah, that's right, yeah.\n\n957\n00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,150\nWho knows.\n\n958\n00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,970\n>> Peer resolution.\n\n959\n00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,310\nSo.\n>> And DNS sec.\n\n960\n00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:07,900\n>> Yeah.\n\n961\n00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,430\n>> Yeah.\nSo\n\n962\n00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:14,570\nunder IPv6 the addresses are such large\nnumbers, they're 128 bit numbers.\n\n963\n00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,070\nThey're such big numbers that we can't\npossibly remember them the way that we\n\n964\n00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,720\nremember IPv4 numbers.\n\n965\n00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,380\nAnd so name resolution\nbecomes not really optional\n\n966\n00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,770\nbut-\n>> Essential.\n\n967\n00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:23,570\n>> Yeah, critical.\n\n968\n00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:28,200\nAnd even without IPv6, just IPv4,\nwe use name resolution all the time.\n\n969\n00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,050\nI can rattle off the names of\nevery server in our server room.\n\n970\n00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,190\nI could probably only rattle off\nthe IP's of maybe half of them.\n\n971\n00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:38,670\nMost of them, I connect to them by name\nbecause that's what I can remember.\n\n972\n00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:42,900\nAnd I rely on name resolution to\nchange that over to an IP, right?\n\n973\n00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,820\nSo so what are some of the problems\nthat can happen there?\n\n974\n00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,590\nWell, I think we've already kind\nof beat it into the ground, but\n\n975\n00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,380\nyou can have typos.\n\n976\n00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> You could put in incorrect DNS servers,\n\n977\n00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,755\nand that can cause name\nresolution to fail.\n\n978\n00:49:53,755 --> 00:49:54,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n979\n00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,879\n>> But but another thing I\nwanna point out, and let me,\n\n980\n00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:59,760\nlet me just fire up a machine here,\nso I can show you guys.\n\n981\n00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,690\nAnother thing that can\nhappen is when we do our\n\n982\n00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:09,435\nlook up we can have issue that are related\nto single name lookups, all right.\n\n983\n00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:10,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Let me show you what I mean by\n\n984\n00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,383\na single name look up.\n\n985\n00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,126\nWhen we do a lookup.\n\n986\n00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:15,180\nWhen we do something like nslookup.\n\n987\n00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:15,980\n>> All right.\n>> Which\n\n988\n00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,670\nby the way is a great\ntroubleshooting command.\n\n989\n00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,060\nIt's name server lookup.\n\n990\n00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,070\nWhere we're doing lookups\nagainst the server.\n\n991\n00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,740\nWe can look up a server by its,\njust its single name.\n\n992\n00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,340\nSo I, I know there's a server\nout there called ITProTV DC2.\n\n993\n00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,090\nAnd if I just stop right here and\n\n994\n00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:36,210\nI press enter, well,\nthere is no DNS zone called ITProTV DC2.\n\n995\n00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,330\nIt needs a domain name that\nit's gotta pull from somewhere.\n\n996\n00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:43,820\nAnd so somewhere,\nit magically pulled out I.T.\n\n997\n00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,820\nproductivity which is our public domain.\n\n998\n00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,680\nWell that's not the domain we use\n\n999\n00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,343\nhere in house as you know here\nin house we use a lab.itpro.tv.\n\n1000\n00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,815\nSo this this is wrong, right?\n\n1001\n00:50:56,815 --> 00:51:01,727\nAnd, as a result,\nit pulled up 173.25.227.128.\n\n1002\n00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:04,015\nThat's a public IP address.\n\n1003\n00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:06,870\nThat is not the IP address of this server.\n\n1004\n00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,415\nAlright.\nIn fact, that IP address,\n\n1005\n00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:14,387\nif you're watching us live on itpro.tv,\nthat is our actual itpro.tv server.\n\n1006\n00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:17,250\nThat's, thats the website that\nyou guys are accessing right now.\n\n1007\n00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,080\nThat is not this domain controller.\n\n1008\n00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:19,760\nAll right?\n\n1009\n00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:26,510\nThe problem is, the name lookup\nused the wrong DNS zone, or domain.\n\n1010\n00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:32,270\nAnd if I added lab.itpro.tv,\nwhich is what we use here in the building,\n\n1011\n00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:36,735\nif I add that, now I get,\noh, look what that did.\n\n1012\n00:51:36,735 --> 00:51:38,960\nLab.itpro.tv.tv.\n\n1013\n00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,350\nMy DNS lookup is just getting worse and\nworse and worse here.\n\n1014\n00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,000\nIf you see something like this,\nwhat the heck is going on.\n\n1015\n00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,690\nRight.\n\n1016\n00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,610\nAnd this can be an easy\ncombination of problems.\n\n1017\n00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,210\nA combination of,\nof where we get these DNS suffixes from.\n\n1018\n00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:55,910\nRight.\n\n1019\n00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,840\nNow quick troubleshooting tip, if you\never get a frustrating thing like this,\n\n1020\n00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,900\nyou can actually override it by adding\na period to the end of your lookup.\n\n1021\n00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,730\nBy adding a period, that says,\nthis is the end of the name,\n\n1022\n00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,780\ndon't stick anything else on it,\nthis is it.\n\n1023\n00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:16,768\nAnd, so I can say nslookup\nitprotvdc2.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n1024\n00:52:16,768 --> 00:52:18,150\nAll right?\n\n1025\n00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:22,470\nAnd when I do that,\nnow it's telling me non-existent domain.\n\n1026\n00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:26,252\nIt wasn't able to find\nthat domain lab.itpro.tv,\n\n1027\n00:52:26,252 --> 00:52:30,720\nso, so I've definitely got\nsome DNS issues going here.\n\n1028\n00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,187\nThe server I was trying to\nlook up on was 10.1.230.201.\n\n1029\n00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:39,550\nMy first instinct needs to be like,\nis that the right IP?\n\n1030\n00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,010\nIs that the server that's out there?\n\n1031\n00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,730\nAnd you know, I thought it was.\n\n1032\n00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,870\nBut [LAUGH] let's go look and see.\n\n1033\n00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:49,280\n>> I think our server's dash DC2.\n\n1034\n00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,130\n>> Is it?\n>> Yep.\n\n1035\n00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,630\n>> See and I could have the wrong name.\n\n1036\n00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,780\n>> I looked on the right hand column\nof your connection screen on there.\n\n1037\n00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,060\n>> Oh,\nyou can't trust what I put over there.\n\n1038\n00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,100\nI put all sorts of crap in there.\n\n1039\n00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,850\nSo.\n[LAUGH] All right, so\n\n1040\n00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,660\nwe've got 10.1.230.201.\n\n1041\n00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,694\nSo that is the right IP for\nthe DNS server.\n\n1042\n00:53:04,694 --> 00:53:07,040\nThe host name,\nit does have a dash in it, look at that.\n\n1043\n00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,700\nSo, I've been doing the wrong\nlookup this whole time.\n\n1044\n00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,970\nSo let's let's go back and\nrinse and repeat.\n\n1045\n00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:15,060\n>> I thought you were\ndoing that on purpose.\n\n1046\n00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,110\nI really did.\n\n1047\n00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,610\n>> So, so let me just repeat then.\n\n1048\n00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:24,830\nWe'll start here with the single\nname lookup with the With a dash.\n\n1049\n00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:25,340\n>> Okay.\n>> And\n\n1050\n00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,500\nnow it is actually\nlooking it up correctly.\n\n1051\n00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,560\nSo where was all that\nother stuff coming from?\n\n1052\n00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,460\nWell it was going upstream trying to\nfind this server that I specified,\n\n1053\n00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,185\nwhich it wasn't finding.\n\n1054\n00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:35,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1055\n00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,560\n>> All right, so so there it is.\n\n1056\n00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,470\nAlthough I am curious why,\noh that's right.\n\n1057\n00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,880\nCuz it was the wrong name,\nthat's why that one lookup didn't work.\n\n1058\n00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,460\nBut but we could go and add to it.\n\n1059\n00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,200\nThe lab that IT pro.tv\nwhich is its full name.\n\n1060\n00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,680\nAnd you know,\nEric's doing the screw up again.\n\n1061\n00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,936\nSo see how it did that last [CROSSTALK]\nAnd if I stick a period on the end\n\n1062\n00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:59,197\nof that, that's the end of the address and\nnow it works properly.\n\n1063\n00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:00,329\nSo you can kind of override it.\n\n1064\n00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,120\nWell, why is it sticking that\nextra domain on the end?\n\n1065\n00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,750\nWhat the heck is going on there?\n\n1066\n00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:11,850\nAnd the thing we have to remember is\nthat if you do a single name lookup,\n\n1067\n00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,950\nthere's three different places\nyou can get additional DNS values\n\n1068\n00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,770\nattached to that entry, right?\n\n1069\n00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:19,980\nOne is DHCP.\n\n1070\n00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:25,680\nIf you're using DHCP,\nwhen you connect your DACP server,\n\n1071\n00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,300\nit might be handing out a DNS suffix.\n\n1072\n00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,340\nSo, right here I've got a DNS\nsuffix search list, and\n\n1073\n00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,510\nit's currently lab.itpro.tv.\n\n1074\n00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:39,720\nA second place you can get a DNS\nsuffix from is your domain.\n\n1075\n00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,600\nIf your workstation is joined to a domain,\nthen you may be pulling one from there.\n\n1076\n00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,410\nAnd it'll normally show up here as\nthe primary DNS suffix an so so\n\n1077\n00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:52,510\nyou know, lab.itpro.tv is our internal\ndomain, and this machine is joined to it.\n\n1078\n00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,960\nSo that's two places where we can get it.\n\n1079\n00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,340\nBut both of those are really\nrelated to server issues and\n\n1080\n00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,170\nnot likely to show up on this exam.\n\n1081\n00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,150\nAnother place though that\nwould show up on this exam\n\n1082\n00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:07,450\nwould be configurations on\nthe network adapter itself.\n\n1083\n00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:08,885\nSo let me, let me just pull that up.\n\n1084\n00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:15,863\nSo I'm going to go into my IPv4 settings,\nhere.\n\n1085\n00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:22,750\nAll right, and I've got a static IP.\n\n1086\n00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:27,940\nI thought I was using DHCP, but I'm not,\nSo there's one incorrect thing.\n\n1087\n00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,920\nBut if I drill down here, and\n\n1088\n00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,792\nI go into my DNS tab\n>> There it is\n\n1089\n00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:33,307\n>> I'll see in here where we can override\n\n1090\n00:55:33,307 --> 00:55:38,104\nour DNS suffix and you'll see append\nprimary connection to specific DNS\n\n1091\n00:55:38,104 --> 00:55:43,135\nsuffixes to single name lookups on this\ninterface and append the suffixes of\n\n1092\n00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:48,500\na primary DNS suffix so That's where we're\ngetting it from DHCP and our domain.\n\n1093\n00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:53,441\nWe can override that if we want by\nchoosing to appending a suffixes in\n\n1094\n00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:58,695\nthis order, and we can manually\nspecify ones to use, all right?\n\n1095\n00:55:58,695 --> 00:56:04,180\nThe only issue with doing that is,\nif we are dynamically updating DNS, right?\n\n1096\n00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,355\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If we're doing automatic\n\n1097\n00:56:05,355 --> 00:56:06,135\nname registration.\n\n1098\n00:56:06,135 --> 00:56:07,675\n>> Right.\n>> It's important to go ahead and\n\n1099\n00:56:07,675 --> 00:56:10,745\nspecify a DNS suffix for\nthis particular connection.\n\n1100\n00:56:10,745 --> 00:56:14,815\nSo, I might say, you know what,\nwhenever I do a lookup, go ahead and\n\n1101\n00:56:14,815 --> 00:56:17,535\nlook to lab.itpro.tv first.\n\n1102\n00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:22,520\nAnd then maybe, if that doesn't work,\ngo ahead and jump up to itpro.tv and\n\n1103\n00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,930\ndo the lookup there, and\nsee how that works, right?\n\n1104\n00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:31,407\nBut for my connection, when I register, I\nwant to register with a lab the itpro.tv.\n\n1105\n00:56:31,407 --> 00:56:32,670\nAll right?\n\n1106\n00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:33,980\nAnd you'll see right here.\n\n1107\n00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,780\nUse this connection's DNS suffix and\nDNS registration,\n\n1108\n00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,927\nthat'll make sure that that's\nthe one that I'm using, all right?\n\n1109\n00:56:39,927 --> 00:56:40,590\n>> All right.\n\n1110\n00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:45,230\n>> So I'm overriding the values that\nI might be pulling from DACP if I\n\n1111\n00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:47,440\nwere using DACP, which I'm not.\n\n1112\n00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,590\n>> There you go.\n\n1113\n00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:50,020\n>> All right, so\nnow when I look at this screen,\n\n1114\n00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,550\nit's not gonna look all\nthat much different.\n\n1115\n00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:54,330\nWhoops, it won't look much\ndifferent if I can type.\n\n1116\n00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,700\nThe main difference will be that here,\nwhere it says DNS subject search list,\n\n1117\n00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,430\nI actually had more than one domain,\nit's just not,\n\n1118\n00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:08,190\nthis command doesn't support showing\nthem all, so I don't see them.\n\n1119\n00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:14,980\nAnd if I do an NS lookup for\na particular address, like itprotv-dc2,\n\n1120\n00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:20,140\nall right,\nit's gonna look to lab.itpro.tv first and\n\n1121\n00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:24,070\nif it doesn't find it there, then it'll\nmove up and check some of the other ones.\n\n1122\n00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:27,835\nSo if I try like three, you know it's\ngoing to move up and try and find one.\n\n1123\n00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:32,504\nAnd see how it looked to\nitprotv-dc3.itpro.tv?\n\n1124\n00:57:32,504 --> 00:57:37,404\nThat was the next domain in that list, and\nwe've got a wildcard DNS value in there,\n\n1125\n00:57:37,404 --> 00:57:39,156\nwhich is why this is working.\n\n1126\n00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,340\nWe wanted to do it for typos.\n\n1127\n00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:48,309\nIf a viewer goes to our actual site,\nit's just itpro.tv, right?\n\n1128\n00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:52,210\nSo, if you wanna go to our website, you\njust type in itpro.tv and you get there.\n\n1129\n00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,850\nBut what if somebody types in www, right?\n\n1130\n00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,873\nOr if they only type in two w's or\nwhatever.\n\n1131\n00:57:59,873 --> 00:58:04,002\nWe wanted to make sure they still get to\nour site, so we put a wildcard in there,\n\n1132\n00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:08,639\nand that's why itpro.tv-dc3 is resolving\nto our website's address, because that\n\n1133\n00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,920\nwas the next thing in my list, it hit that\nwildcard, and you get that value back.\n\n1134\n00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,524\n>> Nice.\n\n1135\n00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:18,692\n>> So just keep in mind with DNS, there\nare several layers deep of where you might\n\n1136\n00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:24,020\nbe getting these names from and so on,\nand one of the best troubleshooting tools\n\n1137\n00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:28,788\nthat I use is NS lookup with throwing\na period on the end of that DNS name to\n\n1138\n00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:33,672\nmake sure that it doesn't do any kind\nof extended suffixes, all right?\n\n1139\n00:58:33,672 --> 00:58:37,189\nEvery once in a while, you'll actually\nbe able to spot some of these DNS issues\n\n1140\n00:58:37,189 --> 00:58:40,067\nbecause you're going to open up a website,\nand all of a sudden,\n\n1141\n00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:41,852\nyou type in a name you can't get there.\n\n1142\n00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:45,030\nLet's say that you're actually doing\nthis with testing on your own web site.\n\n1143\n00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:48,650\nIf you can get there with an IP\naddress instead, then you know you\n\n1144\n00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,430\nare having some name resolution issues\nthat you might have to take care of.\n\n1145\n00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:55,609\nSo helping by using NS lookup, and\n\n1146\n00:58:55,609 --> 00:59:00,320\ntaking a look at those DNS suffixes\ncan really help us out here.\n\n1147\n00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,500\nAnother trick you can use is, if you're\nnot sure if the problem is your DNS server\n\n1148\n00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,520\nor somebody else's, from the command line,\nyou can specify in alternate DNS servers.\n\n1149\n00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,720\nSo for example,\nif I do an NS lookup for CNN.com,\n\n1150\n00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:15,310\nit's apparently gonna take a minute.\n\n1151\n00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,360\nThere we go, and\nthere's the response that I get.\n\n1152\n00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,010\nYou know, it's doing that crazy\nthing again, there we go.\n\n1153\n00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,950\nSo here's the response that I get,\nand I can get some IPs and so on.\n\n1154\n00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,950\nThat's from my server right here.\n\n1155\n00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:28,100\nWell, I can run it against\nsomebody else's server.\n\n1156\n00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,690\nI could say, you know what,\nlet's run this against Google's server\n\n1157\n00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:34,540\njust by adding the IP address of\nthe server at the end of the list.\n\n1158\n00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,760\nAnd so when I do that lookup,\nhere's what Google sees.\n\n1159\n00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,570\nAnd then I could say, well,\nlet me try level 3 communications.\n\n1160\n00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,290\nWe'll just kind of keep rotating through.\n\n1161\n00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:45,410\nAnd we can see the lookup\nfrom more than one server.\n\n1162\n00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:48,240\nVery useful if you wanna weigh\nyour internal servers against\n\n1163\n00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,820\nan external server.\n\n1164\n00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:54,780\nDo be aware, though,\nthat if you're using ping to do\n\n1165\n00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:58,900\nDNS lookup testing, I know a lot of people\ndo that where they'll go ping whatever,\n\n1166\n00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,020\nthat ping makes use of the DNS cache.\n\n1167\n01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,360\nNS lookup doesn't.\n\n1168\n01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:08,790\nNS lookup always initiates a lookup,\nbut ping will use your cache.\n\n1169\n01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,650\nAnd so if it resolved\nsuccessfully a moment ago, your\n\n1170\n01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,620\nping may still show that it's successful\neven though the DNS server's offline.\n\n1171\n01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:21,410\nSo if you're gonna do that,\nyou might need to do an IPConfig/flushDNS\n\n1172\n01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,830\nto clear out that DNS cache,\nand that'll take care of it.\n\n1173\n01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,700\nYou do need to be in elevated, I think.\n\n1174\n01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,740\nYeah, you do need to run the command\nprompt as administrator to do that.\n\n1175\n01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,010\nPersonally, because I'm a network admin,\nbecause I work on the networks all\n\n1176\n01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:39,320\nthe time, I get frustrated with my DNS\ncache, and so I normally disable it.\n\n1177\n01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,009\nIf you ever want to turn\noff your DNS cache,\n\n1178\n01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:45,560\nyou know, if you read on the Internet,\npeople make it out to be this big deal,\n\n1179\n01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,610\nlike oh, it saves you so much time.\n\n1180\n01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,550\nWell you know what,\nit saves you nanoseconds everyday, and\n\n1181\n01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,955\nI've got nanoseconds to spare.\n\n1182\n01:00:51,955 --> 01:00:53,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I just turn off the cache so\n\n1183\n01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,130\nmy system doesn't look up every time.\n\n1184\n01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:59,850\nThat way I can spot problems faster\nthan if I had this cache turned on.\n\n1185\n01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:00,530\n>> Right.\n\n1186\n01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,929\nAnd it's super easy to turn off.\n\n1187\n01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:08,452\nYou just go into your services, and there\nis a service in there called DNS client.\n\n1188\n01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:12,401\nIt's a kind of misleading name.\n\n1189\n01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:16,376\nSee, there it is, DNS Client, because you\nread that name thinking all right, well,\n\n1190\n01:01:16,376 --> 01:01:20,570\nthis is the client, this is what does DNS\nlookups, I don't want to disable that.\n\n1191\n01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,770\nWell, you can come in here,\nand you can stop it.\n\n1192\n01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:25,374\nI'll just stop it right now, and\n\n1193\n01:01:25,374 --> 01:01:30,864\nall that does is disable the DNS\nclient cache, not the client itself.\n\n1194\n01:01:30,864 --> 01:01:36,829\nI can still do NS lookup for Google.com.\n\n1195\n01:01:36,829 --> 01:01:37,389\n>> Yep, still working.\n\n1196\n01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:38,740\n>> Works just fine, right?\n\n1197\n01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,510\nThe only difference is,\nit's no longer being cached.\n\n1198\n01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:45,210\nAnd, Ronnie, do you remember\nthe command to show the cache?\n\n1199\n01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,040\nThere's an ipconfig command that shows it.\n\n1200\n01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,580\n>> Yep, display DNS.\n\n1201\n01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,840\n>> It's what?\n>> Display DNS.\n\n1202\n01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,537\nThere we go.\n\n1203\n01:01:51,537 --> 01:01:55,350\nSo if I try it right now, I get, could\nnot display the DNS resolver cache, and\n\n1204\n01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,720\nthat's because the cache is disabled.\n\n1205\n01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,490\nAnd if I come and turn this back on,\nI guess it's gonna\n\n1206\n01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:06,260\nmake me need to restart for some reason,\nbut there we go, I'll turn it back on.\n\n1207\n01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:10,931\nAnd now, if I go back here,\nand I do a few look-ups, if I.\n\n1208\n01:02:16,297 --> 01:02:22,610\nI need to use pings instead of DNS lookup,\nbecause DNS lookup doesn't use the cache.\n\n1209\n01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,920\nSo I'm just kind of doing a few\nthings here to get some resolution.\n\n1210\n01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,485\nApparently you can't ping CNN.\n\n1211\n01:02:27,485 --> 01:02:28,736\nI'm okay with that though.\n\n1212\n01:02:28,736 --> 01:02:31,591\nAll right, so\nif I do a display DNS, there we go,\n\n1213\n01:02:31,591 --> 01:02:34,570\nI can see those things that\nare now in that cache.\n\n1214\n01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:38,670\nSo on your end users' work stations,\nyou want that cache.\n\n1215\n01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,870\nIt just saves them doing repeated\nlookups when they're constantly going to\n\n1216\n01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:42,950\nthe same site.\n\n1217\n01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,800\nBut as a network admin,\nif you're responsible for\n\n1218\n01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,880\nmonitoring the network,\nnot a bad idea to turn that cache off.\n\n1219\n01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,230\nThat way you can see problems\nas soon as they arise.\n\n1220\n01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,630\nIf you take a look at,\nyou know, my laptop or\n\n1221\n01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:59,410\nmy computer at home and stuff,\nI constantly disable that service.\n\n1222\n01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,720\nIt's one of my things when\nI set up a new machine.\n\n1223\n01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:09,090\nAnyhow, all right, not necessarily\nbest practices per se, but useful.\n\n1224\n01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,180\nAll right.\n\n1225\n01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,863\nRonnie, you got anything\nelse on normal DNS?\n\n1226\n01:03:12,863 --> 01:03:14,789\n>> Nope.\n\n1227\n01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:18,061\nNow let's go into the abnormal,\nthe abnormal DNS.\n\n1228\n01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,649\n>> So let's get into abnormal, right?\n\n1229\n01:03:19,649 --> 01:03:21,832\nSo there's a lot of crazy\nstuff that's out there now.\n\n1230\n01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:24,774\nThe DNS stuff I just showed you guys,\nthat was IPV 4.\n\n1231\n01:03:24,774 --> 01:03:26,625\nIt's the same for IPV 6, right?\n\n1232\n01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:31,454\nAnd in fact, I should have shown that,\nyou know, when you do an NS lookup,\n\n1233\n01:03:31,454 --> 01:03:36,640\nif there's IPV 6 values,\nit'll return IPV 6 addresses also.\n\n1234\n01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,250\nWith commands like ping.\n\n1235\n01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:42,574\nYou can actually ping, so\nlike here I'm doing a ping,\n\n1236\n01:03:42,574 --> 01:03:46,910\nit's pinging with an IPv4\naddress by default.\n\n1237\n01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:51,615\nIf you do a -6,\nit will force it to try and\n\n1238\n01:03:51,615 --> 01:03:55,059\ndo IPv6, so you can you -6 or -4.\n\n1239\n01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:58,755\n-4 will force it to use IPv4,\nand so it'll try and\n\n1240\n01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:01,741\nreach out using that protocol,\nso it's the same command, but\n\n1241\n01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:04,940\nyou can kinda force it to go one or\nthe other based on your priorities.\n\n1242\n01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,120\nI've got my laptop set to, or\nactually that's not my laptop.\n\n1243\n01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,520\n>> No that's the\n>> That machine.\n\n1244\n01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,690\nOh, it's got a static IP.\n\n1245\n01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:12,360\nAnd we didn't assign an IPv6 address.\n\n1246\n01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyhow, if you're trying to use one\n\n1247\n01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:21,487\nprotocol versus the other, you can kind\nof force it from the command line.\n\n1248\n01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:25,040\nBut name resolution under IPv6\nis kind of a different thing.\n\n1249\n01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,930\nBecause in IPv6,\n\n1250\n01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:32,340\nyou don't necessarily have to have DNS\nservers just for local resolution.\n\n1251\n01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,415\nWe have something called\nthe Peer Name Resolution Protocol or\n\n1252\n01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:41,320\nPNRP, that can be used to find\nother machines on our network.\n\n1253\n01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,590\nIt's kind of like ARP,\nthe Address Resolution Protocol.\n\n1254\n01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:47,140\nWhere, with ARP you can\nsend out a broadcast to\n\n1255\n01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,880\nfind out somebody's MAC address.\n\n1256\n01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,770\nWith PNRP, you use multicasts\nto advertise yourself and\n\n1257\n01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:57,060\nto find other people that\nare registered on the network.\n\n1258\n01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,529\nPNRP for the most part, is automatic.\n\n1259\n01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:03,066\nAnd, unless you've broken it yourself,\ndoesn't typically\n\n1260\n01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:07,550\nrequire troubleshooting at all,\nit just works, it's like an Apple product.\n\n1261\n01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:08,652\nRight, it's magic.\n\n1262\n01:05:08,652 --> 01:05:14,920\nSo, it works, if your system has an IPv6\naddress, It's using PNRP out of the box.\n\n1263\n01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,380\nIt should be able to\ndiscover other people,\n\n1264\n01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,200\nother people should be\nable to discover you.\n\n1265\n01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,430\nAnd it should work.\n\n1266\n01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:21,710\n>> Yeah, there's just a couple\nof different settings.\n\n1267\n01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:22,720\nLike on the firewall and\n\n1268\n01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,440\nthen a couple of different\nsettings to actually see it work.\n\n1269\n01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:25,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n1270\n01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:29,290\nSo I use the operator\nshould with all of that.\n\n1271\n01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:31,220\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] >> Because in theory it does work.\n\n1272\n01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,710\nBut what if you have messed\naround with the machine?\n\n1273\n01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,160\nWhat if you have changed your settings?\n\n1274\n01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,540\nIt is possible to break the PNRP.\n\n1275\n01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:41,030\nThe two most common culprits,\none is the firewall,\n\n1276\n01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:44,570\nlike Ronnie mentioned, and\ntwo is the PNRP service.\n\n1277\n01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:47,480\nIf you stop the PNRP service,\nit's not going to work.\n\n1278\n01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,280\nI think I'm already in the service\nto screen, so let's start there.\n\n1279\n01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:54,500\nIn your services,\nif you kind of browse around in there,\n\n1280\n01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:59,690\nyou will find a peer name resolution\nprotocol, this guy right here.\n\n1281\n01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,538\nOk, peer name resolution protocol.\n\n1282\n01:06:01,538 --> 01:06:05,790\nIf you wanna do single name lookups of\n\n1283\n01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:10,360\nhosts on your IPv6 network,\nthis service has got to be started.\n\n1284\n01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,370\nIf it's not started, if it's disabled or\n\n1285\n01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:16,250\nnot running like mine's not running\nright now, then, it's not gonna work.\n\n1286\n01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,650\nNow mine's in manual mode.\n\n1287\n01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:22,910\nWhen I start to kick off PNRP lookups,\nit's gonna start running on it's own.\n\n1288\n01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:27,000\nBut if I want it always to be available,\nif I don't have DNS servers on my\n\n1289\n01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,200\nIPv6 network, then I probably\nwant to set this to automatic so\n\n1290\n01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,090\nthat it's always running,\nand we can find those peers.\n\n1291\n01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,580\nThis would be good in small\nwork groups environments.\n\n1292\n01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,900\nAnd, in fact, if you have a Windows Home\ngroup, it will turn that on by default.\n\n1293\n01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,440\nBut in a server environment,\nwe normally have DNS servers, and so\n\n1294\n01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,380\nwe don't need this which\nis why it's set to manual.\n\n1295\n01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,367\nI'm going to go ahead and\nfire mine up though.\n\n1296\n01:06:55,652 --> 01:06:56,890\nThere we go.\n\n1297\n01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:58,100\nSo now I've got PNRP running.\n\n1298\n01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:01,690\nThe other thing is the firewall.\n\n1299\n01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:04,720\nPNRP, and I made a little note before\nthis show, let me just bring it up here.\n\n1300\n01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,940\nOops, that's not it.\n\n1301\n01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,870\nHere we go.\n\n1302\n01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:19,178\nPNRP, it's a UDP based protocol, so\nit uses user datagram, protocol.\n\n1303\n01:07:19,178 --> 01:07:23,520\nAnd it works on ports 35, 40, and 1900.\n\n1304\n01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,180\n35, 40 being the main one right.\n\n1305\n01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:28,550\nThat's where PNRP runs but\n\n1306\n01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:33,270\nit also uses the simple service discovery\nprotocol, SSDP, which is running at 1900.\n\n1307\n01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:36,803\nThat let's us not only find hosts, but\nsome of the services that they're running.\n\n1308\n01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:40,971\nSo you know, DNS, or email.\n\n1309\n01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:42,510\nAll sorts of various other services.\n\n1310\n01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,560\nLDAP, mostly, to find domain controllers.\n\n1311\n01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,570\nSo it's all sorts of stuff like that,\nthat is available there.\n\n1312\n01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,420\nThese have to be opened\nup on the firewall.\n\n1313\n01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:54,942\nAnd there's default rules in the Windows\nfirewall where it should be turned on, but\n\n1314\n01:07:54,942 --> 01:07:57,441\nit is possible that\nthey've been turned off.\n\n1315\n01:07:57,441 --> 01:07:59,090\nI mean,\nwe can look at this machine to see.\n\n1316\n01:08:05,183 --> 01:08:09,722\nOr, I want to be advanced security\nlet me get into that course.\n\n1317\n01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:10,453\nWe're advanced.\n\n1318\n01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:19,919\nNow, unfortunately Microsoft's\nnaming convention for\n\n1319\n01:08:19,919 --> 01:08:24,960\nthis stuff is a little quirky, so finding\nthe entry in here can take just a moment.\n\n1320\n01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,080\nSo let me see if I can spot it real quick.\n\n1321\n01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,284\nThere's neighbor discovery for ICMP.\n\n1322\n01:08:34,191 --> 01:08:36,630\nWe'll just skim down our list and,\noh there.\n\n1323\n01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:39,540\nSo here,\nnotice how it says homegroup in PNRP?\n\n1324\n01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:44,130\nSo, I mentioned that if you got\na Windows homegroup set up,\n\n1325\n01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,950\nthat it's gonna use PNRP on that\nlocal network and turn it on.\n\n1326\n01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:49,810\nSo, I'm not in a home group,\nand so here's the rule,\n\n1327\n01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:55,230\nbut notice how that rule is grey, it's\ndisabled, so PNRP is not turned on there.\n\n1328\n01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,363\nNow let me just keep skimming,\n\n1329\n01:08:57,363 --> 01:09:01,640\ncuz I think there is another rule in here,\nlet me just browse.\n\n1330\n01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,897\nThere's SSVP, which is also not turned on.\n\n1331\n01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:09,227\nAnd more SSDP, blah blah blah.\n\n1332\n01:09:12,184 --> 01:09:13,206\nThere.\n\n1333\n01:09:13,206 --> 01:09:18,000\nPNRP, so here we've got it for\nRemote Assistance.\n\n1334\n01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,625\nSomebody local on our network\ntrying to manage us, so again,\n\n1335\n01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:25,668\na scoped rule that's only going to allow\ncertain people to do PNRP to find us.\n\n1336\n01:09:25,668 --> 01:09:31,020\nAnd, anybody else?\n\n1337\n01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,320\nGo with Skype, gotta have that one.\n\n1338\n01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:35,990\nYou know, we never even\ninstalled Skype on this machine,\n\n1339\n01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,170\nI wonder how that ended up in there.\n\n1340\n01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:41,550\nAnd that looks like about it, so\n\n1341\n01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:46,000\nhere's PNRP, just for Windows peer\nto peer collaboration foundation.\n\n1342\n01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,420\nAnd that's about it.\n\n1343\n01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,020\nSo I found several rules referencing PNRP.\n\n1344\n01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,630\nNone of them are turned on.\n\n1345\n01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:55,680\nIf I leave it this way,\nI can still use PNRP,\n\n1346\n01:09:55,680 --> 01:10:00,630\nI can use it to find other people,\nbut they won't be able to find me.\n\n1347\n01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:04,450\nSo that's one of the big\nproblems we have with PNRP,\n\n1348\n01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,770\nis getting it setup this way,\nwe'll need to open up firewall rules.\n\n1349\n01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:11,670\nEither for\nthe specific applications we want,\n\n1350\n01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:17,220\nlike they were listed here; Windows Home\ngroup or Remote Assistance or whatever.\n\n1351\n01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:21,080\nOr we need to create our own rules, that\nopen it up for every application to be\n\n1352\n01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,530\nable to use, for doing that main\nresolution on the local network.\n\n1353\n01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,910\nNow, a couple of commands for\ntrouble shooting PNRP.\n\n1354\n01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:32,620\nI'm gonna switch to my laptop\ncause it is on my laptop.\n\n1355\n01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,630\nA couple of commands that we can use.\n\n1356\n01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:39,060\nThe way PNRP works,\nis it defines what are called clouds.\n\n1357\n01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:43,482\nEach of your IPv6 network interfaces\nare identified as having a cloud.\n\n1358\n01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:47,772\nIt maps names to IPv6 addresses and\nties them to a cloud cache, so\n\n1359\n01:10:47,772 --> 01:10:50,347\nit's got a cache for each of the cloud.\n\n1360\n01:10:50,347 --> 01:10:53,354\nAnd you know a cloud, it's just a network,\nso each network that it sees,\n\n1361\n01:10:53,354 --> 01:10:54,730\nit identifies it.\n\n1362\n01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,740\nSo the three commands that I use for\ntroubleshooting.\n\n1363\n01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:02,050\nFirst off,\nyou can pull up a list of your clouds.\n\n1364\n01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,750\nSo just give me a list of\nthe clouds that I've got.\n\n1365\n01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,810\nYou can pull up a detailed list of your\nclouds using another netsh command.\n\n1366\n01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,829\nSo netsh is kind of our go to guy for\nthis.\n\n1367\n01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:18,200\nOnce we see our clouds,\nthen we can test PNRP, and\n\n1368\n01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,970\nyou test it by doing, basically a ping,\nusing PNRP for the lookup.\n\n1369\n01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:28,364\nBecause ping by default will use DNS and\nso it's not a good way to test PNRP.\n\n1370\n01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:31,458\nwe need to use a netsh command to do it.\n\n1371\n01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:35,189\nIf we want to see that in action,\nI can try and find Ronnie's machine,\n\n1372\n01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:38,000\nif I want to find his on the network.\n\n1373\n01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,958\nSo let me let me open up a command prompt\nhere, and Let me just resize this window.\n\n1374\n01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:48,199\nI've got it a little bit over sized here,\ndon't I?\n\n1375\n01:11:54,264 --> 01:11:57,570\nAll right, so let's start with\njust kinda looking at the network.\n\n1376\n01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:59,140\nSo I wanna find Ronnie's machine.\n\n1377\n01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,984\nNow I already know the name\nof Ronnie's laptop.\n\n1378\n01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:01,580\nRight.\n\n1379\n01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,170\nOr I could use my laptop for that matter.\n\n1380\n01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,750\nBut I already know the name.\n\n1381\n01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:09,440\nI wanna test whether PNRP is working or\nnot, all right?\n\n1382\n01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,710\nSo the first thing I need to do is I\nneed to know the name of my Cloud.\n\n1383\n01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:15,380\nNow, I've got multiple\nnetworks in my laptop,\n\n1384\n01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:18,290\nbecause I've got a wireless\nnetwork adapter.\n\n1385\n01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:20,150\nI've got a wired network adapter.\n\n1386\n01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:22,000\nI've got a Bluetooth network.\n\n1387\n01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,120\nSo I've got at least three\nnetworks that are on my device.\n\n1388\n01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,350\nSo that's where the first\nnetsh command comes in.\n\n1389\n01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:36,592\nNetsh p2p because it's peer to peer,\npnrp cloud show list.\n\n1390\n01:12:36,592 --> 01:12:42,180\nThat's gonna give me a summary of\nthe Clouds that are present on my laptop,\n\n1391\n01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,950\nand I currently see two.\n\n1392\n01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,828\nI had a virtual one for Hyper-V that I\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1393\n01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:48,010\n>> Uninstalled during one of the breaks.\n\n1394\n01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:50,270\nNow I'm down to just two.\n\n1395\n01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:53,230\nOne of these will correspond\nto my wireless network.\n\n1396\n01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:55,990\nAnd the other one will correspond\nto my wired network, all right.\n\n1397\n01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,660\nWhich is which?\n\n1398\n01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:58,872\nI don't honestly know.\n\n1399\n01:12:58,872 --> 01:13:02,413\nThey've got zone numbers attached to them,\n53 and 9.\n\n1400\n01:13:02,413 --> 01:13:07,422\nAnd if I do an ipconfig/all,\nand I look at my output here,\n\n1401\n01:13:07,422 --> 01:13:10,300\nwhich I can't see my scroll bar.\n\n1402\n01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,613\nLet me resize my window again.\n\n1403\n01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:17,720\nThere we go.\n\n1404\n01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:22,110\nIf I go back and\nI look at my ipconfig output.\n\n1405\n01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:26,490\nI can see here, see the percent 53\nzone attached to that IPv6 address?\n\n1406\n01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,720\nSo this is my wired adapter.\n\n1407\n01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,166\nAnd I can see that it's zone 53.\n\n1408\n01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:31,866\nAnd that's the one I'm\nplugged into right now.\n\n1409\n01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:36,945\nSo I should be able to spot Ronnie\non that Cloud number 53, right?\n\n1410\n01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:40,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So kinda going back to this one.\n\n1411\n01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,960\nNow, it's not effective on my laptop.\n\n1412\n01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,470\nBut on some people's\nmachines they can actually\n\n1413\n01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:49,470\nfigure that out a little bit easier,\nusing another command.\n\n1414\n01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:54,820\nInstead of doing cloud show list,\nyou could do cloud show names.\n\n1415\n01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:58,250\nAnd it gives you more detailed\noutput of the Clouds.\n\n1416\n01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:02,360\nAnd sometimes it will actually say,\nthe name of the adapter.\n\n1417\n01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,250\nAnd you can see that on desktops\nwith integrated adapters.\n\n1418\n01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,435\nOn my laptop it doesn't-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1419\n01:14:07,435 --> 01:14:09,940\n>> It gives you basically the same output,\n\n1420\n01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,200\nso not useful for me.\n\n1421\n01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,550\nBut now that I know the name of\nthe Cloud that he's connected to,\n\n1422\n01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:16,500\nwhich was this guy up here.\n\n1423\n01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:21,710\nIt was, link local ff00 which\nis a multicast address ::%53\n\n1424\n01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:27,500\nthat means my IPv6 address on that nic /8.\n\n1425\n01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,940\nThat's the Cloud.\n\n1426\n01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:31,660\nI should be able to\nfind him on that Cloud.\n\n1427\n01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:39,894\nAnd I can do a netsh p2p\npnrp diag ping host.\n\n1428\n01:14:39,894 --> 01:14:41,970\nAnd now I'm gonna try to PNG his machine.\n\n1429\n01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:48,881\nNow, his machine is serenity01,\nand then I'll say cloud equals.\n\n1430\n01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:53,345\nAnd I'm gonna paste in that cloud\nname I copied before and pasted.\n\n1431\n01:14:53,345 --> 01:14:54,203\n[CROSSTALK] Yep.\n\n1432\n01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:55,317\nAnd now it's gonna reach-\n>> So easy.\n\n1433\n01:14:55,317 --> 01:14:56,165\n>> Out on the network.\n\n1434\n01:14:56,165 --> 01:14:56,804\n>> There it is.\n\n1435\n01:14:56,804 --> 01:14:59,930\n>> And if PNRP is working,\nI should find him.\n\n1436\n01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:01,220\nI should get that source that messaged.\n\n1437\n01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:06,230\nThere it is, there is his IPv6 link\nlocal address that I talked to him with.\n\n1438\n01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:10,460\nAnd he's out there and\nI know it used PNRP to find him.\n\n1439\n01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:14,327\nIf it failed, 9 times out of 10 you've\ngot a firewall issue between them.\n\n1440\n01:15:14,327 --> 01:15:15,850\n>> Yeah.\n\n1441\n01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:19,200\n>> Or\none of the systems is not running PNRP.\n\n1442\n01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:19,840\nAll right?\n\n1443\n01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,770\nSo not the easiest commands to remember.\n\n1444\n01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:25,973\nBut the key things to remember here\nis don't rely on the regular PNG\n\n1445\n01:15:25,973 --> 01:15:26,760\ncommand because-\n>> Right.\n\n1446\n01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,910\n>> It will use DNS and even NetBIOS.\n\n1447\n01:15:29,910 --> 01:15:32,490\nIt won't use PNRP by default.\n\n1448\n01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:34,309\nThat's why we've got to go\nto these netsh command.\n\n1449\n01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:37,107\n>> Right.\n\n1450\n01:15:37,107 --> 01:15:42,080\n>> All right, that's really about it\nfrom the PNRP there's not much to it.\n\n1451\n01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,460\nTo restart the service, open the firewall\nuse the right diagnostic tools.\n\n1452\n01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,930\nThat's about the whole deal.\n\n1453\n01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,420\nWe still need to talk about DNS sec,\n\n1454\n01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,560\nbut we've kind of run to\nthe end of this segment.\n\n1455\n01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,690\nSo we still have,\nwell we've actually got quite a bit.\n\n1456\n01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:55,669\n>> We did.\n>> We might have to do a part\n\n1457\n01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:56,180\ntwo on this one.\n\n1458\n01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:56,880\n>> Maybe.\n\n1459\n01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,600\n>> All right.\n\n1460\n01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,970\nWhen we get back we need to talk\nabout DNS sec or security NS.\n\n1461\n01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:04,430\nAnd how that works?\n\n1462\n01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:06,140\nAnd how our clients get involved with it?\n\n1463\n01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,680\nAnd then yeah, I don't think we're gonna\nbe able to get to all of our objectives.\n\n1464\n01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,179\nSo we'll have to do\na part two on this show.\n\n1465\n01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:11,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n1466\n01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:14,420\n>> So that we can spend enough time\ntalking about wireless connectivity\n\n1467\n01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:15,770\nas well as IPsec.\n\n1468\n01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,504\nAnd other network security firewall stuff-\n>> Right.\n\n1469\n01:16:17,504 --> 01:16:18,234\n>> And all of that.\nSo\n\n1470\n01:16:18,234 --> 01:16:22,280\nyeah, that's a good spot to leave it at.\n\n1471\n01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,960\nAll right, let's stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n1472\n01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,690\nWhen we get back, DNSSec after this.\n\n1473\n01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:29,489\n[SOUND]\n\n1474\n01:16:29,489 --> 01:16:35,087\nAll right.\n\n1475\n01:16:35,087 --> 01:16:36,580\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n1476\n01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:39,860\nSo for our last segment, we want to talk\na little bit more about some DNS issues.\n\n1477\n01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,533\nAnd we've gone a-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1478\n01:16:41,533 --> 01:16:42,600\n>> Little further in depth on some of\n\n1479\n01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,520\nthe topics than we planned.\n\n1480\n01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,730\nSo what we'll do is we'll talk\na little more about DNS and\n\n1481\n01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:46,880\nwe'll probably wrap the show there.\n\n1482\n01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,640\nAnd then we'll do a part two and\nwe'll cover some of those other things.\n\n1483\n01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,280\nBut the other DNS issue or\n\n1484\n01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:57,590\ntrouble shooting thing that we might\nhave to get involved with is DNSSec.\n\n1485\n01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:00,880\nNow, if you're not familiar with DNSsec or\nD-N-S-S-E-C.\n\n1486\n01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,350\nIt's a new security protocol that's\nbeing implemented on the root DNS\n\n1487\n01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,130\nservers on the internet.\n\n1488\n01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:10,190\nAnd it's the reaction to a number of\n\n1489\n01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,590\nhigh visibility DNS attacks that\nhave happened in the last few years.\n\n1490\n01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:19,640\nIt's primarily a server to server method\nfor authenticating DNS servers and\n\n1491\n01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:24,280\nensuring that we're not getting malicious\nor poisoned DNS results, right.\n\n1492\n01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:29,410\nThe DNS cache on a DNS server is a high,\nit's a big target, right?\n\n1493\n01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,130\nSo DNSSec is designed to fix that.\n\n1494\n01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:35,800\nWell, if it's a server technology and\nit's protecting servers,\n\n1495\n01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,770\nyou might ask yourself, why do we need\nto talk about it in Windows 8 show?\n\n1496\n01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:41,780\nAnd I would agree with you on that.\n\n1497\n01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:44,060\nRight?\nThere's not really a whole lot we do here.\n\n1498\n01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:47,170\nBut Windows 8 is one of\nthe few operating systems,\n\n1499\n01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:50,230\nthat's an operating system\nthat is DNSSec aware.\n\n1500\n01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:50,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n1501\n01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:53,870\n>> And what that means is that\nwhile our Windows 8 machines can't\n\n1502\n01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,210\nactually do DNS validation themselves.\n\n1503\n01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,518\nWe can still use them for\n\n1504\n01:17:57,518 --> 01:18:01,385\ntroubleshooting and verifying that\nDNSSec is operational, right?\n\n1505\n01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:02,046\n>> Yeah.\n\n1506\n01:18:02,046 --> 01:18:06,491\n>> And that is what Microsoft is\ncalling out in this objective,\n\n1507\n01:18:06,491 --> 01:18:09,463\nwhich is where they just say and DNS set.\n\n1508\n01:18:09,463 --> 01:18:10,055\n>> Yeah.\n\n1509\n01:18:10,055 --> 01:18:13,473\n>> What they're saying is not necessarily\ntroubleshooting DNS sec on a Windows 8\n\n1510\n01:18:13,473 --> 01:18:15,238\nmachine, cuz it can't do validation.\n\n1511\n01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:18,160\nBut just using it to troubleshoot\nproblems on our servers.\n\n1512\n01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,610\n>> Yeah, some of the things that ended up\nhappening right with that DNS cache is\n\n1513\n01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:23,560\nyou may actually go to a DNS server.\n\n1514\n01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,110\nHow do you know that you're actually\ngetting the right response back?\n\n1515\n01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:30,450\nSo one of the things we can do is actually\nbuild or use some of the DNS utilities\n\n1516\n01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:34,870\nthat prove that we're actually getting the\nactual right record from the right server.\n\n1517\n01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:35,548\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1518\n01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:38,790\n>> So with DNSSec basically what\nhappens is the servers start to\n\n1519\n01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:41,160\ndigitally sign their zones.\n\n1520\n01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:44,410\nAnd if there's ever an update that comes\nthrough it has to have a digital signature\n\n1521\n01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:45,000\nthat matches.\n\n1522\n01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,727\n>> Right.\n>> And you can quickly validate\n\n1523\n01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:49,563\nthe results you're getting\nare from a trusted server.\n\n1524\n01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:53,710\nA server that has a certificate\nthat you validated, and you accept.\n\n1525\n01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:58,320\nSo the problem is when you configure on\na server how do you verify that it works?\n\n1526\n01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,500\nAnd that's where you need a client\nthat's DNSSec aware to test with it.\n\n1527\n01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:05,820\nIn Windows 8 we got a snazzy little\nPowerShell command that we can use just\n\n1528\n01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:06,640\nfor that purpose.\n\n1529\n01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,740\nSo let me pull up my Windows 8 machine,\nwhich I got a ton of windows open on.\n\n1530\n01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:15,588\nAnd what we can do is in\nthe PowerShell we have\n\n1531\n01:19:15,588 --> 01:19:19,644\na command which let's\nus do name resolution.\n\n1532\n01:19:19,644 --> 01:19:23,446\nSo we can do resolves\nnot resolved dash name,\n\n1533\n01:19:23,446 --> 01:19:26,860\nit is really poor resolve dash DNS name.\n\n1534\n01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:28,617\nThere we go.\n\n1535\n01:19:28,617 --> 01:19:29,520\nThere.\n\n1536\n01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,950\nResolve-dnsname.\n\n1537\n01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,416\nIt's a PowerShell command\nthat's a part of Windows 8.\n\n1538\n01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:35,708\nAnd it let's us do name lookup, all right?\n\n1539\n01:19:35,708 --> 01:19:38,090\nWell, as far as doing\njust a basic name lookup,\n\n1540\n01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:42,090\nthe way the command works is you specify\na name and you specify a server.\n\n1541\n01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:44,833\nAnd then it just does\na regular DNS lookup.\n\n1542\n01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:49,000\nBut there's a cool modifier for the\ncommand, let me just bring that up here.\n\n1543\n01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,770\nAnd, you know,\nmy notes are getting a little messy, so\n\n1544\n01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:53,870\nlet me just kind of get it so\nit's the only thing on the screen.\n\n1545\n01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:54,960\nThere we go.\n\n1546\n01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,570\nSo what you can see is resolve-dnsname,\nand we specify a name and a server.\n\n1547\n01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:04,470\nNow, If we just do it that way,\nit's the same thing as NSlookup.\n\n1548\n01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:09,060\nIt's looking up the host name on a DNS\nserver and providing you a result.\n\n1549\n01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:14,940\nBut if you add this extra flag,\nDnssecOk, right?\n\n1550\n01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:19,160\nThat says, verify that DNS security\nis turned on and okay, and\n\n1551\n01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,960\ngive us a little bit of\ninformation about it.\n\n1552\n01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,482\nIt's a great way to test and see whether\nyour servers are properly handling DNSSEC.\n\n1553\n01:20:25,482 --> 01:20:29,440\nAll right, so\nI just set up a little example.\n\n1554\n01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,060\nI created two zones.\n\n1555\n01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:37,450\nI created a zone called signedzone.com and\nanother one called unsignedzone.com.\n\n1556\n01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:41,980\nAnd I digitally signed the signedzone.com\nand I didn't do it on the other one.\n\n1557\n01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:46,770\nSo we can use resolve-dnsname to verify\nwhether or not those are signed or not.\n\n1558\n01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,690\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n1559\n01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:52,142\nSo let me just go back to my server here,\nand let me just break out of that.\n\n1560\n01:20:52,142 --> 01:20:57,140\nAll right, and so\nI'm going to say resolve-dnsname, and for\n\n1561\n01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:04,150\nthe name I'm just going to\nsay host.unsignedzone.com.\n\n1562\n01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,260\nDid I spell it right?\n\n1563\n01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:05,940\nYes.\n\n1564\n01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,930\nAnd then for the server,\nI'll specify my server.\n\n1565\n01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:13,430\nNow, if I just leave it like this,\nit's just doing a normal DNS lookup.\n\n1566\n01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:15,710\nIt'll give me the same\ninformation that NS lookup would.\n\n1567\n01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:19,940\nHere's the IP address of that host.\n\n1568\n01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:20,920\nOkay?\n\n1569\n01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:27,790\nBut if I add the DnssecOK flag, all right?\n\n1570\n01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:30,510\nIt's also going to validate DNSsec.\n\n1571\n01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,870\nNow when I run it here,\nI get my query back and\n\n1572\n01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:37,600\nI get my result, but\nthere is no certificate information.\n\n1573\n01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,540\nAnd that's because this\nis an unsigned zone.\n\n1574\n01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,450\nDNSsec is not enabled on this one.\n\n1575\n01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:49,290\nBut if I switch, and lookup against\nmy signed zone that I created.\n\n1576\n01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:51,810\nThis is the one that I digitally signed.\n\n1577\n01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:56,365\nWhen I run it,\nin addition to the lookup, I get that\n\n1578\n01:21:56,365 --> 01:22:01,620\nit was able to pull an RSA signature.\n\n1579\n01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,870\nSo it was able to pull\nthat digital signature.\n\n1580\n01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,770\nI got an answer back from that server.\n\n1581\n01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:08,680\nIt was signed by signedzone.com.\n\n1582\n01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,570\nThe certificate expires March 3rd, 2014.\n\n1583\n01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:15,050\nSo I can see that it is\na valid certificate.\n\n1584\n01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,430\nFrom a host that I trust.\n\n1585\n01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,430\nAnd I allowed it.\n\n1586\n01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,180\nAnd it's a good connection.\n\n1587\n01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:19,750\nAll right?\n\n1588\n01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:20,500\nSo, quick and\n\n1589\n01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:24,550\neasy way that we can validate that DNSsec\nis working on our server, versus not.\n\n1590\n01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:26,600\nWhen it's working, we see the certificate.\n\n1591\n01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,810\nWhen it's not working,\nwe don't see the certificate.\n\n1592\n01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:30,600\nRight?\n\n1593\n01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:35,880\nAnd if you're just doing the DNS lookups\nthemselves, right, just for the unsigned\n\n1594\n01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:41,180\nand for the signed, you don't notice, you\ndon't see whether DNSsec is being used.\n\n1595\n01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:46,700\nAll right, so keep in mind that\nwith DNSsec, basically you're\n\n1596\n01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:50,990\nvalidating whether or not the result\nyou're getting back is from a true server.\n\n1597\n01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:53,400\nAnd those servers can do that,\nthey can validate.\n\n1598\n01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,020\nSo, when DNS records are being handed off\n\n1599\n01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:59,660\nrecursively from server to server to\nserver to server, they can validate.\n\n1600\n01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:01,260\nThey can ensure they haven't\nbeen tampered with and\n\n1601\n01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,460\nthey're not from malicious sources.\n\n1602\n01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,920\nFrom a client, we can't do that.\n\n1603\n01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,750\nWe can just see that it's happening by\nquerying the server using resolve-dnsname.\n\n1604\n01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:14,980\nAnd it's a great idea to remember that\ncommand right there for the exam,\n\n1605\n01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:19,530\nespecially with the extra\nlittle add on of DnssecOK.\n\n1606\n01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:21,970\nIt's not the easiest one to remember.\n\n1607\n01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,950\nBut that's basically DNS security.\n\n1608\n01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:31,160\nIt's a great technology,\nit's rolled out already on the Internet so\n\n1609\n01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:36,170\nyou can actually run this kind of test\nagainst servers out there on the Internet.\n\n1610\n01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:37,900\nLet me try, we'll experiment.\n\n1611\n01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:44,161\nLet's do a lookup for www.google.com.\n\n1612\n01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:49,780\nAnd I'll do it against\none of Google's servers.\n\n1613\n01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,020\nNow this isn't a root server.\n\n1614\n01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:55,020\nThe root servers are where DNSsec was\nrolled out in the very beginning.\n\n1615\n01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:59,930\nWhen I run a query against them,\nnope, they are not running DNSsec.\n\n1616\n01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:02,690\nLet's try Level3,\nwe'll see if we can find somebody.\n\n1617\n01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:06,650\nNope.\n\n1618\n01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,410\nLet's pull an actual root server.\n\n1619\n01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,410\nLet's go crazy.\n\n1620\n01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:11,402\nThey might not be\nallowing me to do DNSsec.\n\n1621\n01:24:11,402 --> 01:24:15,920\nYou know, when you do DNS lookups,\n\n1622\n01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,350\nthey expect you to do it against\nthe down-level server, not a root.\n\n1623\n01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,490\nSo, I'm gonna give it a shot here, and\ntry against one of the root servers.\n\n1624\n01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:25,290\nI'll just take the first\none that I find here.\n\n1625\n01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:29,525\nI'm kinda curious to see what'll happen.\n\n1626\n01:24:29,525 --> 01:24:33,960\n[LAUGH] It's probably gonna\nbe very anticlimactic.\n\n1627\n01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,770\nYou know we feel like something\nreally cool is gonna happen.\n\n1628\n01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:43,850\nAnd resource unavailable,\nRCODE server failure.\n\n1629\n01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:44,440\nThat's different.\n\n1630\n01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:49,910\nI'm gonna get rid of my trailing dot.\n\n1631\n01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:54,999\nResource unavailable.\n\n1632\n01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,450\nThat server must not be\nallowing direct connections.\n\n1633\n01:25:01,850 --> 01:25:05,260\nLet me try one of the Icam ones,\nwe'll try a different IP.\n\n1634\n01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:08,280\nIf it doesn't work, they might not\nbe allowing client connections.\n\n1635\n01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:12,120\nThe root servers are very busy handling\nreferrals from other DNS servers.\n\n1636\n01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:16,360\nSo they are more than likely just\nblocking the connection from a client.\n\n1637\n01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,790\nWhy let a client do a run\nagainst an actual root server?\n\n1638\n01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:22,049\nThat would be crazy talk.\n\n1639\n01:25:25,543 --> 01:25:27,088\nYeah, that must be what's going on.\n\n1640\n01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:28,757\nSo on my own internal servers, though,\n\n1641\n01:25:28,757 --> 01:25:30,880\nI am allowing connections\ndirectly from a client.\n\n1642\n01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,150\nAnd so I can see it,\njust against our server, just fine.\n\n1643\n01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:37,220\nAnd that's just a great way to verify,\nmaking sure that works.\n\n1644\n01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,580\nYou've got to verify from somewhere and\nthis'll do it.\n\n1645\n01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:44,435\nIt applies on the server also, so\nit's really just that same process.\n\n1646\n01:25:44,435 --> 01:25:49,924\nYeah, let me just do one\nmore with a signed host.\n\n1647\n01:25:54,185 --> 01:25:54,730\nThere we go.\n\n1648\n01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,640\nAgain, just validating that\nwe got that certificate.\n\n1649\n01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,180\nAll right.\nSo, that's all we really need to\n\n1650\n01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,230\nknow about DNSsec.\n\n1651\n01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,720\nSo, if we run through\nthose commands again.\n\n1652\n01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,530\nWe had PNRP, right, where we needed\nto verify that our firewall had ports\n\n1653\n01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:07,610\nopen and that we were able to\ndetect other people on the network.\n\n1654\n01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:10,730\nBut DNSsec, we just need to be able to\nvalidate that a certificate is showing up\n\n1655\n01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:12,350\nfor that zone and that we trust it, right?\n\n1656\n01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:14,340\nThat we're allowing\nthe results to come through.\n\n1657\n01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,480\nAnd the other bullet point in\nthe objective was just straight up,\n\n1658\n01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,160\nregular name resolution.\n\n1659\n01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,620\nThere we need to worry about what\nnameservers we specified in our config,\n\n1660\n01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,200\nas well as our DNS suffixes.\n\n1661\n01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:28,270\nAnd that they can come from multiple\nplaces like the domain that we've joined,\n\n1662\n01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:30,880\nthe suffix we attached\ndirectly to the interface, or\n\n1663\n01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,320\nsuffixes that we learned\nfrom a DHCP server.\n\n1664\n01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,350\n>> Remember in the IP configurations\nthat we actually had,\n\n1665\n01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:40,620\na lot of problems really do stem\nfrom static configurations.\n\n1666\n01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:43,490\nWhere we tend to have more, again,\n\n1667\n01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:47,795\ntypos than anything else, as well\nas just missing information, right?\n\n1668\n01:26:47,795 --> 01:26:52,710\nTaking a look at this subnet mask,\nverifying the idea of the default gateway\n\n1669\n01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:56,340\nand the actual IP address of that\nhost are on the same network, too.\n\n1670\n01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:01,190\n>> All right, well, Ronnie,\nthat's probably a pretty good spot for\n\n1671\n01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,350\nus to wrap up the show.\n\n1672\n01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:03,330\n>> Sounds great.\n>> Like I said,\n\n1673\n01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:05,370\nwe do have two more bullet\npoints in this objective.\n\n1674\n01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:06,790\nWe've got wireless networks and\n\n1675\n01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:09,520\nconnections that we need to work\non troubleshooting and managing.\n\n1676\n01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,367\nAnd then lastly, we've got network\nsecurity including Windows Firewall and\n\n1677\n01:27:13,367 --> 01:27:15,240\nIPsec, right, IP security.\n\n1678\n01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:18,685\nThere's a pretty big topic right there, so\nwhat we're gonna do is we're going to go\n\n1679\n01:27:18,685 --> 01:27:20,990\nahead and wrap it up right here for\nthis show.\n\n1680\n01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:23,861\nStay tuned, though, because it'll\nprobably be, oh, today's Friday.\n\n1681\n01:27:23,861 --> 01:27:26,500\nSo it'll definitely be next week\nbefore we get into park two.\n\n1682\n01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,876\nBut in next week's episode,\nwe'll jump into part two and\n\n1683\n01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,775\nwrap up those other objectives and\nmake sure we get it all covered.\n\n1684\n01:27:31,775 --> 01:27:34,559\nSo keep in mind,\nif you have any questions,\n\n1685\n01:27:34,559 --> 01:27:37,889\nlive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1686\n01:27:37,889 --> 01:27:40,591\nYou'll see the chat room\nright beneath the video.\n\n1687\n01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:42,135\nYou can post your questions.\n\n1688\n01:27:42,135 --> 01:27:45,067\nWe monitor and\nanswer live during the show.\n\n1689\n01:27:45,067 --> 01:27:49,370\nAlso, if you have questions after\nthe show, just hit that Q and\n\n1690\n01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,590\nA link at the top of the page.\n\n1691\n01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:53,640\nEvery ITProTV page has that Q and\nA link at the top.\n\n1692\n01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:56,440\nYou click on that, it'll take you\nto our question and answer pages.\n\n1693\n01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,250\nYou can post a question,\nwe monitor it and we answer it,

right.\n\n5\n00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:37,390\nWelcome back to another\nfantastic episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,280\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,070\n>> Yes.\n\n8\n00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,880\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,948\n>> Pretty good.\nPretty good.\n\n10\n00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:45,280\nHow, how was lunch today?\n\n11\n00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,030\n>> It was, it was wonderful.\n\n12\n00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,522\nHow was the flower arranging class?\n\n13\n00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:50,560\n>> [LAUGH] How was, how was what?\n\n14\n00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,750\nOh, the flower class?\n\n15\n00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,095\n>> Yeah, your flower arranging class.\n\n16\n00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,420\n>> I'm, I'm sorry I couldn't\nattend to be your partner there.\n\n17\n00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,140\nI, hopefully you took a lot of pictures so\nI can see.\n\n18\n00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,500\n>> I only took one picture.\n\n19\n00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,110\n>> All right, well make sure you-\n>> Not of you.\n\n20\n00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,720\n>> Oh, yeah.\nMake sure you scrap book it.\n\n21\n00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,813\n>> That's right.\n\n22\n00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:11,900\nAll right [LAUGH] so today we've got a,\nthe 7688 objective today.\n\n23\n00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,781\nAnd, for the official objectives,\nscrolling down in the list of things.\n\n24\n00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:20,183\nAll right, there's gonna be a 2.1.1.4.\n\n25\n00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:21,123\n>> Wow.\n\n26\n00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:21,703\n>> I know.\n\n27\n00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:22,260\nA network security.\n\n28\n00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,967\n>> That's quite a subtopic.\n\n29\n00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,619\n>> I know they should of\nnest that in there, right?\n\n30\n00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:29,470\n[LAUGH] Network security including\nWindows Firewall and IP security,\n\n31\n00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,915\nwhich IP security will be IPsec,\nor IP sec.\n\n32\n00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:34,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And and\n\n33\n00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,500\ntoday-\n>> I love IPsec.\n\n34\n00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,878\n>> Yeah, IPsec so today we'll block an app\nat the firewool at the firewall by using\n\n35\n00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:46,350\nby using a, a rule and\nthen we will encrypt our ping packets.\n\n36\n00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,706\nAnd, sniff it out and look at it.\n\n37\n00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:50,240\n>> Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,949\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n39\n00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:54,496\n>> Now remember that in terms of\nnetwork security for us, right?\n\n40\n00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:57,083\nWe do have to actually\nprovide security in-depth,\n\n41\n00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,271\nwhere we defend at\nthe edge of our networks.\n\n42\n00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:03,835\n>> As well as on individual devices\nwithin our network as well, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:07,369\nSo when we start think thinking and\ndealing with things like that, right?\n\n44\n00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,280\nWe actually provide different layers of\nsecurity that really do help protect our\n\n45\n00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,360\nindividual computers as well.\n\n46\n00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,130\nWe only provide it at\nthe edge of our network,\n\n47\n00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,220\nthat protects us from the outside\nworld such as the internet.\n\n48\n00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,530\nBut what happens though if an attack\nalready gets through that?\n\n49\n00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,820\nOr originates from the inside?\n\n50\n00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,000\nWell this is where we can actually use\nthings like the Windows Firewall to help\n\n51\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,090\nus, as well as the way to establish\nthe idea what we call a tunnel connection\n\n52\n00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,792\ninside, to also help us to\nprotect our traffic there.\n\n53\n00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:37,020\nSo we wanna take a look at\nthe implementation of these and\n\n54\n00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,040\nwe'll also wanna talk about the idea of\nwhy we actually need to do this, okay?\n\n55\n00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,340\nSo when we start thinking about this idea,\n\n56\n00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,940\nthere are common network security\nthreats that we all must be aware of.\n\n57\n00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,520\nEven if you're actually just\ngetting into the Windows 8 world,\n\n58\n00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,850\nthere are multiple ones that we want\nto actually take a look at here.\n\n59\n00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,290\nSo we will try this once again [LAUGH] and\n\n60\n00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,670\nmy incredible incredible lack\nof drawing skills, I would say.\n\n61\n00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,450\n>> No, that's really good.\n\n62\n00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,730\nThat-\n>> Try and help us here.\n\n63\n00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,410\n>> That's professional\ndrawing right there.\n\n64\n00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,630\n>> Well that's not actually a drawing.\n\n65\n00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,720\nThat's actually a Visio diagram for us.\n\n66\n00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,130\nBut I'll, I'll take the credit for\nthis one in terms of implementation.\n\n67\n00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,180\nSo some of the things that we're worried\nabout in terms of protecting our network\n\n68\n00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,600\nhere is the idea of what we\ncall eavesdropping attacks.\n\n69\n00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,180\nOkay?\n\n70\n00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,660\nNow, the idea of the eavesdropping attack.\n\n71\n00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,500\nNotice that if you connect in,\n\n72\n00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,720\nall the devices are essentially\nconnected to the same network here.\n\n73\n00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,900\nWe have a PC on one side.\n\n74\n00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,050\nWe have a server on the other side here.\n\n75\n00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,280\nAnd we have somebody that actually\nhas plugged into the network.\n\n76\n00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,840\nNow there are ways,\nif I can get everything to work here.\n\n77\n00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,290\nLegitimate traffic can be\ngoing on between the PC and\n\n78\n00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,380\nthe actual server at this point.\n\n79\n00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,395\nBut there are ways that\nwe can actually do this.\n\n80\n00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:50,520\nWhereas a copy of that traffic goes on,\na copy of it sent through the switch\n\n81\n00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,510\ncould also be sent down here,\nas well as here, giving the attacker\n\n82\n00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,590\nessentially a copy of all the traffic that\nis going on between these two machines.\n\n83\n00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,500\nSo that is unauthorized access to\nthis traffic and they're now able to\n\n84\n00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,110\nessentially just take a look at everything\nthat we actually have going on here, and\n\n85\n00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,610\nsee what information that they need,\nand then they can move on.\n\n86\n00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n87\n00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,265\n>> It's pretty dangerous, especially\nif your information's sensitive.\n\n88\n00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:14,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n89\n00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,820\n>> Sensitive stuff.\n\n91\n00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,440\n>> Yeah.\n\n92\n00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,980\nI, of course, I mean with the like, like\nstreaming all your movies that you do at,\n\n93\n00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,130\nat, at home that would I guess that would\nbe kind of nice because then if you,\n\n94\n00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,080\nyou know, and then people could tune\nin for the My Little Pony show.\n\n95\n00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,790\nAnd watch it.\n\n96\n00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,500\n>> Yes.\n\n97\n00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,005\nYes, they could.\n\n98\n00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n99\n00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,920\n>> Yeah.\n\n100\n00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,350\nAnother type of attack here\nthat we could also have, for\n\n101\n00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,200\nexample, is what we call\na denial-of-service.\n\n102\n00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,670\nA lot of times you see it\nwritten out as DOD, or\n\n103\n00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,660\nthere's even what they call a distributed\ndenial-of-service attack as well.\n\n104\n00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,060\nSo, I don't know why I said DOD.\n\n105\n00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,680\nIt should be DOS.\n\n106\n00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,655\nThat's me for not thinking.\n\n107\n00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:51,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Here.\n\n108\n00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,024\nSo it should be DOS here.\n\n109\n00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:54,375\nDenial-of-service attack.\n\n110\n00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:59,090\n>> A denial-of-service attack,\nif I can get this going on here.\n\n111\n00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,304\nOkay.\n\n112\n00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:05,920\nIt's, no, again,\nmy ability to do this correctly here.\n\n113\n00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,220\nIs we still have the same\nnetwork going on, but\n\n114\n00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,880\nwhat we can do is have the attacker flood\n\n115\n00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,940\nthe server with so many requests here,\nas just an example,\n\n116\n00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,710\nwhere the legitimate traffic going on,\nit just doesn't have a chance.\n\n117\n00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,080\nSo, we have one stream, and\nit maybe ought to get a packet in.\n\n118\n00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,850\nBut maybe the server at this point\ndoesn't have enough resources\n\n119\n00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,910\nto be able to reply back to that.\n\n120\n00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,040\nSo, this allows for that resource\nessentially to be blocked off\n\n121\n00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,300\nto where it really can't\nhandle anything else, okay?\n\n122\n00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,780\nSo that's when we, we,\nwhere we can do that.\n\n123\n00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,857\nA lot of times when you see this\nat the edge of the network,\n\n124\n00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:45,173\nyou see the router is actually\nthe one that's being attacked.\n\n125\n00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:47,669\nThey simply go ahead and\nthey overload the router where,\n\n126\n00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:51,371\nagain they can't even respond back out to\nthe, the rest of the network here, okay?\n\n127\n00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n128\n00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,573\nSo if if, if that was the case then,\nso if the,\n\n129\n00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:58,807\nif the router on the edge of the network\nthen is, is being overloaded of course,\n\n130\n00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:02,680\nall of the communications on the inside\nof the network would be just fine.\n\n131\n00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,235\n>> Yeah\n>> As,\n\n132\n00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:07,526\nas far as I don't know like printing\nout stuff that you need to print,\n\n133\n00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:08,631\nit'll all go fine,\n\n134\n00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:13,466\nbut just all those external connections\nto the outside would then be limited.\n\n135\n00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:15,491\n>> Yeah, and if you're actually\nrunning a business, right?\n\n136\n00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:19,213\nAnd your, you know, your network actually\ndepends on that particular connection,\n\n137\n00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,521\nwell then if they can deny access to\nsomebody trying to purchase something,\n\n138\n00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,080\nwell you're in trouble.\n\n139\n00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,460\nNow you can do it on the inside as well,\nand people can do it inadvertently\n\n140\n00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,940\nby simply just connecting and,\nand leaving their connections up.\n\n141\n00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,810\nWhere now, there's a legitimate need for\n\n142\n00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,730\na resource, we don't have any connections\navailable for somebody to gain access to.\n\n143\n00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,090\nNow, the next one here is what\nI call port scanning, okay?\n\n144\n00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,990\nNow the port scanning type of attack,\nthe attacker has software\n\n145\n00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,340\nrunning on his bigger computer\nthat he can target the actual\n\n146\n00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,720\nmachine that he wants to try and see what\nports are actually open for connections.\n\n147\n00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,820\nSo on his particular machine, he sends\nover essentially a list of questions,\n\n148\n00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,490\nI guess is the easiest\nway to describe it here.\n\n149\n00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,520\nIt says hey, is port 20 open?\n\n150\n00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,140\nWell, servers are saying yeah,\nsure, why not?\n\n151\n00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,350\nI can respond back to that.\n\n152\n00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,740\nBut then there comes a time in\nwhich a port is not actually open.\n\n153\n00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,130\nWell then it may not\nget a response at all.\n\n154\n00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,980\nAnd that means that the attacker\nthen actually knows that particular\n\n155\n00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,390\nport may not be open to\nactually any attack.\n\n156\n00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,200\nNow, on that sense right?\n\n157\n00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,480\nThere is ports that you're gonna\nalways need to be open here, so\n\n158\n00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,220\nthis means you have to be careful\nwith the ports that you leave open.\n\n159\n00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,900\nYou wanna turn off all the ports you don't\nwant to actually leave open as well.\n\n160\n00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,940\nSo this type of attack is more of\nwhat we call a reconnaissance or\n\n161\n00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,490\nfootprinting, where they're just trying\nto take a look at what's around here and\n\n162\n00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,632\nwhat surface they can actually get in,\nget in key into.\n\n163\n00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,785\nSo that so that, let me see running.\n\n165\n00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that, the attacker PC there, so\n\n166\n00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,030\nhe's asking if server one is running FTP?\n\n167\n00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n168\n00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,410\n>> And to see if he has SSH open?\n\n169\n00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,270\n>> Nice, ooh.\n\n170\n00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,010\nVery good.\n\n171\n00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,450\n>> And Telnet.\n\n172\n00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,190\n>> Telnet, yeah.\n\n173\n00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,254\n>> And of course if he's got his\nhis web server running there, too.\n\n174\n00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:06,650\n>> Very good at the port numbers.\n\n175\n00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,239\nYeah, very impressive.\n\n176\n00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:07,888\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n177\n00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,721\nVery impressive.\n>> Nice, what do I, what do I win?\n\n178\n00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,319\n>> You, you, you you win whatever you win.\n\n179\n00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There you go.\n\n180\n00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820\n>> Thanks, Ronnie. [LAUGH] >> Yeah,\nyeah, now, you, you're welcome.\n\n181\n00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,468\nSo, and, and plus,\nthere was a skill there.\n\n182\n00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:19,542\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay?\n\n183\n00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,930\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> The last\n\n184\n00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,270\none is what we'll call\na man in the middle type.\n\n185\n00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,040\nNow there was no easy way for\nme to draw this the way that I wanted to.\n\n186\n00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,850\nSo I just had to kind of finish it.\n\n187\n00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,430\nThe attacker is no longer off to the side,\nso no, they're no longer out of band,\n\n188\n00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,360\nsimply just making their\nthicker connections coming in.\n\n189\n00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,010\nWhat they do instead is that they\nliterally put themselves in-between\n\n190\n00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,960\nthe actual traffic itself.\n\n191\n00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,980\n'kay.\n\n192\n00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,330\nSo that was the only way I could figure\nout how to actually make this work,\n\n193\n00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,580\nand of course I can't draw it,\ndrop it exactly on top of the way, what,\n\n194\n00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,080\nwhat I wanted it to, but its close enough.\n\n195\n00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,850\nBy inserting themselves in between, right.\n\n196\n00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,620\nNow PC one here,\neven though originally he thought\n\n197\n00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,260\nhe was talking to server one, he really\nnow is actually talking to the attacker.\n\n198\n00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,190\nThe attacker's actually responding back,\nand then the server 1 responds back,\n\n199\n00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,500\nit actually again talks\nback to the other side.\n\n200\n00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,420\nSo he puts himself in between here,\nessentially eavesdropping, again, but\n\n201\n00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,610\nthis time he's actually inserted himself\nin and not getting a copy of it instead.\n\n202\n00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,610\nNow, the problem that we have with\na majority of these attacks here Kay, so\n\n203\n00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,660\neaves dropping attacks that we just talked\nabout here, or port scanning attacks,\n\n204\n00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,360\nor man in the middle attacks that we have.\n\n205\n00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,640\nThese are attacks that can go on and\n\n206\n00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,340\nthe user may not ever know\nthat it's actually happening.\n\n207\n00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,480\nIf the attack actually finishes and\n\n208\n00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,840\nthe attacker disappears, They may\nnever know that anything is happening.\n\n209\n00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,390\nSo very difficult to catch after the fact.\n\n210\n00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,800\nOkay, in other words,\nonce it's done, it's done.\n\n211\n00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,455\nYou have to try and\nactually catch it while it's happening.\n\n212\n00:09:54,455 --> 00:09:58,290\nNow, if you're like me, I would never,\n\n213\n00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,660\never know that I need to be\non guard against this stuff.\n\n214\n00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,460\nSo it's very difficult to protect\nagainst this type of attack.\n\n215\n00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,850\nSo that's why we need to think about\nthe idea of not just defending,\n\n216\n00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,410\nbut strategically actually saying, well,\nwhat can we do against these attacks?\n\n217\n00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,640\nI, 24 hours a day,\n\n218\n00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,690\nI can't know if somebody's just\ndoing an eavesdropping attack.\n\n219\n00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,880\nI don't have access to\neverything on my network, okay?\n\n220\n00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,180\nI may not ever be able to tell if there's\na man in the middle attack or if someone's\n\n221\n00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,320\nactually just again doing some type of,\nof scan, port scanning attack very easily.\n\n222\n00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,180\nSo, what do we do?\n\n223\n00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,990\nWell, there's several mitigation\ntechniques that we can actually talk\n\n224\n00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,400\nabout here, just briefly,\nas we move through this.\n\n225\n00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,170\nSo, Ronny so let me ask you which,\nwhich attack is your favorite to do?\n\n226\n00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,305\n>> I, I think eavesdropping would probably\nbe the only one that I could probably do.\n\n227\n00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,670\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n228\n00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,430\n>> Yep.\nMan,\n\n229\n00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,930\nI know well I'm gonna have to protect\nmy PC from eavesdropping then.\n\n230\n00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,840\n>> Yes.\nMm-hm.\n\n231\n00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,500\n>> Yeah.\nCuz I, when I put my ear up to it,\n\n232\n00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,350\nI hear everything.\n\n233\n00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,460\n>> Oh, yeah the, oh like, like fans?\n\n234\n00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,350\nAnd my hard drive driving?\n\n235\n00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,010\n>> Yeah.\nThat's it.\n\n236\n00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,660\nThat's the only thing I can do.\n\n237\n00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,170\n>> Have, have you ever heard an SSD grind?\n\n238\n00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,320\nHard drive\n>> No\n\n239\n00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320\n>> As it calculates?\n\n240\n00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,190\n>> I have not.\n\n241\n00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,340\n>> Do they, do they make noise?\n\n242\n00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,600\n>> I think so, since they have so\nmany moving parts.\n\n243\n00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,810\nIt's just incredible.\n\n244\n00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,610\n>> So,\nyou need moving parts to make noise?\n\n245\n00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,490\n>> In theory\n>> Hm.\n\n246\n00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,015\n>> Unless you're actually just dragging\nthe SSD on the ground itself, yes.\n\n247\n00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I believe you need moving,\n\n248\n00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:21,990\nmoving parts.\n\n249\n00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,240\n>> Just rubbing it on-\n>> Yes.\n\n250\n00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,120\n>> Okay.\n>> You know, like,\n\n251\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,181\nwhen you were scratching your CDs back and\nforth to make the-\n\n252\n00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:27,884\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:28,510\n>> The music.\n\n254\n00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,370\n>> Your records.\n\n255\n00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:29,917\nRecords.\n\n256\n00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,795\n>> Yeah, it's a record, so-\n>> Record.\n\n257\n00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:32,733\n[LAUGH] Man.\n\n258\n00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,680\nThat's funny.\n\n259\n00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,660\nAll right all right, so\nwe've got these different network.\n\n260\n00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,260\n>> Attacks that we have\ngoing on on our network.\n\n261\n00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,610\nSo, the, so what's first?\n\n262\n00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,470\nWhat's first in trying to,\nmitigate ourselves, or\n\n263\n00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,520\nprotect ourselves, from,\nfrom these attacks?\n\n264\n00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,050\n>> Yeah, it's a great question for us to\nactually have here when we start thinking\n\n265\n00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,250\nabout\n>> There are many mitigation techniques.\n\n266\n00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,720\nRight?\nThat we actually have.\n\n267\n00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,370\nOne of the first ones that we\nalways think about, right?\n\n268\n00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,240\nIs the ability to protect\nthe individual machine itself.\n\n269\n00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,790\nOkay?\n\n270\n00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,266\nSo, we might think about\ninstalling things like anti-virus.\n\n271\n00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,560\nAnd again, anti-malware here.\n\n272\n00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,810\nWell, as much as that hel, helps to, to,\n\n273\n00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,710\nprevent the idea of viruses getting\non the computer and malware from\n\n274\n00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,250\nstealing some of the information, the type\nof things that I actually mentioned\n\n275\n00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,350\nare actually attacks of being able to\nget the data directly off the wire.\n\n276\n00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,000\nAnd for what they really are.\n\n277\n00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,580\nAnd so, for\n\n278\n00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,740\nus here, we might need to actually\nthink about some other things as well.\n\n279\n00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,230\nNow, even though we might think about\nthe idea of anti antivirus and,\n\n280\n00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,290\nand again, anti-malware things\nAntifreeze Antifreeze is another one\n\n281\n00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,210\nthat help cool our computer system down,\n[laugh] is another possibility.\n\n282\n00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:49,655\nBut the other thing that also comes from\nthis is having a sound network policy.\n\n283\n00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:53,670\nMm-hm, as well that is in place\nthat says what we can do.\n\n284\n00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,660\nNow remember that for\nus policies occur in two ways.\n\n285\n00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,360\nOne is a written policy and\n\n286\n00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,540\nagain something I should say,\nHere's the acceptable use policy, Nathan.\n\n287\n00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,212\nFollow it.\n\n288\n00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:04,795\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Nathan could look right at it and\n\n289\n00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,580\nsimply just toss it away.\n\n290\n00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,050\nI wouldn't do that, though.\n\n292\n00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,830\n>> No, never.\n\n293\n00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,200\n>> No, you, you follow policy,\nthat's right.\n\n294\n00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,080\n>> That's what it's there for.\n\n295\n00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,270\n>> You always follow policy.\n\n296\n00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,480\n>> And that's a great idea, as long as\neverybody understands that you do it.\n\n297\n00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,610\nSomebody can simply just take that\npiece of paper and just toss it, and\n\n298\n00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,970\nnot even think twice about it,\nand then at that point\n\n299\n00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,850\ntheir computer can actually be opened\nup to any attack on the server.\n\n300\n00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,520\nThe other way we can do it\nis we can enforce policy\n\n301\n00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,170\nby using things like active directory\ngroup policy that we have, and\n\n302\n00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,610\neven individual local group that we\nhave on the computers themselves.\n\n303\n00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,960\nAnd that enforces the policy,\nit says Nathan will comply.\n\n304\n00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,980\nI don't care what Nathan says.\n\n305\n00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,990\nI don't care what Nathan\ndoes with a piece of paper.\n\n306\n00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,120\nIt's gonna happen.\n\n307\n00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,170\nHow about that?\n\n308\n00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,120\n>> Yeah, well, that's fine because it,\nit wouldn't even be an issue.\n\n309\n00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,540\n>> Yep.\n>> Because I, I would follow the rule.\n\n310\n00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,190\nAs a matter of fact, I'd probably be\nthe one writing the dang gone policy.\n\n311\n00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,490\n>> You probably would be.\n\n312\n00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,700\nYes, yes, you would.\n\n313\n00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,250\n>> Al lright.\n>> You're a much better writer than I am.\n\n314\n00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,280\nSo, yeah.\n\n315\n00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,436\n>> I don't know, my,\nmy English and grammar ain't good.\n\n316\n00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:06,558\n>> Ain't good.\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Yeah, thanks, Ronnie.\n\n317\n00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:07,881\nI went to public school.\n\n318\n00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,608\n>> Very proud, very proud.\n\n319\n00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:11,119\n>> Thank you.\n\n320\n00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:11,620\nYes.\n\n321\n00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,860\n>> All right.\n\n322\n00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,190\nSo, the first thing that we'll do,\nI suppose as far as, you know, I\n\n323\n00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,740\nguess enforcing these types of policies is\nto do it on the, on the local system here.\n\n324\n00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,990\nWe have a, I guess as far as an example\ngoes we have a, an app We have the,\n\n325\n00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,200\nthe steam client that that\nwhat we'll do I guess is\n\n326\n00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,680\nuse the Windows firewall to block this\nguy from, I guess running essentially.\n\n327\n00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,186\n>> Yeah\n>> Mh-mm.\n\n328\n00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:40,920\n>> Yeah, now when we start talking about\n\n329\n00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,750\nthis on the individual policy level or\nthe individual computer level here.\n\n330\n00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,800\nThere's a couple of other things\nwe need to think about as well,\n\n331\n00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,610\nright, in protecting the overall\nmachine and network, too.\n\n332\n00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,870\nIs that we can provide some kind\nof encryption of our traffic,\n\n333\n00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,920\nand that's what we're\ntalking about as well.\n\n334\n00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,580\nSo, on the Windows 8 machine, we really\nhave two things that are built in for us.\n\n335\n00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,110\nI'm going to take a look at these\nrelatively in-depth here when we do this,\n\n336\n00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,850\nand, and show you all the options\nthat are actually there for us.\n\n337\n00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,380\nThe idea of the Windows firewall\nis where we're going to go first,\n\n338\n00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,770\nand we're going to go ahead and\ntake a look at this idea too.\n\n339\n00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,170\nNow, when we start talking\nabout the idea of a firewall,\n\n340\n00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:19,790\nNate do you know where the term firewall\noriginates for our security purposes.\n\n341\n00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,120\n>> Firewall like on a\n>> A car, or in a, a building, and\n\n342\n00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,900\nit's a a wall that keeps things out,\n\n343\n00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,340\nlike engine exploding, and\nfrom fire from burning you up.\n\n344\n00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,300\n>> Yes.\n>> Is that right?\n\n345\n00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,340\n>> That is, that is true, yes.\n\n346\n00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,970\n>> Oh, no way.\nNice.\n\n347\n00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,730\n>> Yeah, so it keeps the engine\nbay separated out from the cab\n\n348\n00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,140\nwhere people are actually\nnormally sitting here.\n\n349\n00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,210\nAnd that particular wall right there,\nright, is designed to help the head and\n\n350\n00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,410\nalso the fire to not get in to\nthe cab as quickly as we want to.\n\n351\n00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,530\nAnd inside of building you\nmay also see this too.\n\n352\n00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,893\nYou might see where they rate it as\na two hour wall or a one hour wall.\n\n353\n00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:57,443\nIt takes a lot of time\nbefore you can get through.\n\n354\n00:15:57,443 --> 00:16:01,545\nA firewall is designed for\nus- To simply burn off traffic or\n\n355\n00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:06,400\nto deny traffic that we don't want\nto come through that entryway.\n\n356\n00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,140\nOkay.\n\n357\n00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,340\nNow on the r, edge of our networks right,\nnormally when you start hearing about\n\n358\n00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,540\nthings like that you hear\nabout a hardware device.\n\n359\n00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,270\nThat plugs in between the internet and\nyour network, or\n\n360\n00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,530\nin between your router that's connected\nto your internet connection, and\n\n361\n00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,940\nthe rest of your network here.\n\n362\n00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,240\nAnd that is, again,\nproviding that firewall protection for\n\n363\n00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,840\nus that we can block unwanted\ntraffic from getting in.\n\n364\n00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,280\nWe can also block traffic from getting\nout of the actual network as well.\n\n365\n00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,370\nBut down on the individual systems,\nlike our Windows 8 desktops that we\n\n366\n00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,670\nmight actually be sitting at here,\nwe also have the Windows firewall.\n\n367\n00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,040\nAnd it really comes in two factors here.\n\n368\n00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,998\nYou wanna demonstrate-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n369\n00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:46,405\n>> What we're talking about here as we-\n>> Yeah.\n\n370\n00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,100\n>> Proceed-\n>> Yeah, demonstrate like physically-\n\n371\n00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,790\n>> Like, actually do it.\n\n372\n00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,744\n>> Oh, [LAUGH] yes.\n\n373\n00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:52,500\n>> All right.\n\n374\n00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,706\nYes, Ryan.\nGreat.\n\n375\n00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:58,192\n>> [COUGH] So on,\non my PC here, we, oh, yeah,\n\n376\n00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:01,960\nfor this one we'll use a,\nvirtual machine I got up and running.\n\n377\n00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,530\nAll right, so we, we kinda have two\nflavors of Windows firewall more or less.\n\n378\n00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,290\nWe have just regular straight up Windows\nfirewall I would say, and then these,\n\n379\n00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,375\nthe Windows firewall with advanced\nsecurity where we have a,\n\n380\n00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,780\na lot more options to a, to go there.\n\n381\n00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,380\nAnd just like many things in Windows\nthere are many ways to get somewhere.\n\n382\n00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,200\nI'll use actions sooner\nto get to control panel.\n\n383\n00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,210\nWhich we will do system and\nsecurity, and Windows firewall.\n\n384\n00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,500\nNow here we go we just\nstarted up Windows firewall.\n\n385\n00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,530\nWe have our network\nlocations that are up here,\n\n386\n00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,990\nI am currently connected to the domain\nnetwork and green check mark so\n\n387\n00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,520\nthat Windows firewall is on,\nits running, its listening.\n\n388\n00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,120\nAnd it is blocking or allowing according\nto what we have set it up for.\n\n389\n00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,880\n>> Yeah.\n\n390\n00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,510\nNow with that Windows Firewall\nthat we're seeing right here,\n\n391\n00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,040\nnotice it's blocking in three\ndifferent network types, right?\n\n392\n00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,970\nThe idea of the domain for\nus is where our work is going to be and\n\n393\n00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,000\nthat one actually allows for\nmost of the actual computer network and\n\n394\n00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,750\napplications to be let through.\n\n395\n00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,760\nThe reason why is because a lot of\ntimes we're also protected inside\n\n396\n00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,410\nwith other network security\ndevices that we have.\n\n397\n00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,030\nOkay?\n\n398\n00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,811\nSo that domain setting actually allows,\nor is actually less restrec,\n\n399\n00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:18,380\nleast restrictive, sorry,\nby comparison as we as we go through this.\n\n400\n00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,670\nNow the other one that we\nhave is the private network.\n\n401\n00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,920\nCan you go ahead and\nclick on that chevron?\n\n402\n00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,780\n>> Yes, man.\n>> Thank you.\n\n403\n00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,820\nSo notice here the way it\nactually describes it.\n\n404\n00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,690\nIt says incoming connection,\n\n405\n00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,980\nblock all connections that are not on\nthe list of approved or allowed apps here.\n\n406\n00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,170\nAnd then it says, notify me.\n\n407\n00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,760\nOkay?\n\n408\n00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,740\nNow one is actually saying, what?\n\n409\n00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,270\nLet's let's do the same thing here.\n\n410\n00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,510\nLet's block everything.\n\n411\n00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,220\nOkay?\n\n412\n00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,880\nAnd the other one here is actually\na little bit more restrictive as well.\n\n413\n00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,220\nSo the private one normally is going to\nbe home, network at that point where you\n\n414\n00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,210\nmight have some devices that are not\ngoing to be behind a lot of protection.\n\n415\n00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,820\nAnd then you have your individual one.\n\n416\n00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,580\nAnd then absolutely lastly\nhere is the public,\n\n417\n00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,220\nwhere it is by far\nthe most restrictive here.\n\n418\n00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,130\nThis one doesn't even allow you to\nbe seen on somebody else's network.\n\n419\n00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,105\nSo if you're sitting at Starbucks,\ngetting your $7 cup of coffee, Nathan,\n\n420\n00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:07,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n421\n00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,190\n>> And sitting there, looking suave and\ndebonair in your mo hair.\n\n422\n00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,278\nWhat no alpaca!\n\n423\n00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,318\nAlpaca sweater!\n\n424\n00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:16,450\n>> Mm-hm.\nYes, thank you.\n\n425\n00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,470\nI know with on my bright color Vespa.\n\n426\n00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,990\n>> That's right.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n427\n00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,992\n>> On your blight,\nbright-colored Vespa with a pink helmet.\n\n428\n00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:22,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n429\n00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,605\n>> And you'll be ready to go.\n\n430\n00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:24,105\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n431\n00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,340\nCoffee in one,\n\n432\n00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,260\ngot the handlebar in the other hand.\n\n433\n00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,770\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n434\n00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,430\nBut you're just sitting there at\nStarbucks with this private network here,\n\n435\n00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,585\nit allows us to essentially\njust block everything, okay.\n\n436\n00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:35,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n437\n00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,000\nBy default.\n\n438\n00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,700\n>> By default.\n\n439\n00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,310\n>> By default, of course that, the,\nall these settings we can go in there and\n\n440\n00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,565\nwe can allow ourselves to be\nseen on the public profile.\n\n441\n00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:45,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And and\n\n442\n00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,820\nwe can also allow ourselves not to\nbe seen on the private and domain.\n\n443\n00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,710\nSo, I mean,\nwe have a lot of control over this stuff.\n\n444\n00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,380\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n445\n00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,140\n>> And we take a look on the left\nhand side of this particular window,\n\n446\n00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,800\nyou can see where it says change\nnotification settings, so notice that\n\n447\n00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,960\nthere's options over here that we have\n>> And\n\n448\n00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,380\nnotice you can completely\nturn this off if you want to.\n\n449\n00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,290\nNow, notice it actually says what,\n\n450\n00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,060\non the off,\nnot recommended is what it actually says.\n\n451\n00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,500\nSo it's telling you, you can do it but we\nreally don't want you to actually do this.\n\n452\n00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,240\nNow, is it important that we have\nthree different profiles that are,\n\n453\n00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,680\n>> You know, in an important, convenient,\n\n454\n00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,220\nyes.\n\n455\n00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,284\n>> Okay.\n\n456\n00:20:22,284 --> 00:20:25,468\n>> So that, you know, on, on each one\nof these, these network locations.\n\n457\n00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:26,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n458\n00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,050\n>> The the domain, the private,\nand the public here.\n\n459\n00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,680\nNow we can have certain firewall rules,\n\n460\n00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,650\nthat will kick in depending on\nwhere we are, or not where we are.\n\n461\n00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,770\nWell, yeah, kind of where we are,\nbut on our network location.\n\n462\n00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,860\nSo, we can be blocked from being\nseen on the public profile.\n\n463\n00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,170\nWe can be seen while we're on\nthe the private profile and\n\n464\n00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,585\nwith you know, the domain profile,\nI guess whatever policy gets pushed up.\n\n465\n00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:52,291\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, with the more restrictive\n\n466\n00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,427\nsecurity settings that we have, right?\n\n467\n00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:58,770\nWe're saying that hey, the network that\nI'm on is less secure than I think it is.\n\n468\n00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,650\nSo we may have a more restrictive\nprofile on that public one.\n\n469\n00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,320\nAnd won't actually keep it that way.\n\n470\n00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,690\nWhereas inside of your domain now there's\nother that are things protecting you may\n\n471\n00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:14,140\nwanna allow more in a, a, less\nrestrictions than we would normally have.\n\n472\n00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,860\nSo you can go in here and\nchange this up to.\n\n473\n00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,660\nNow, just when I said that,\neven though you can change them,\n\n474\n00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,110\nif you're inside of a business network,\nthey may not allow you to change them,\n\n475\n00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,330\nespecially if your computer's\npart of that network.\n\n476\n00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,380\nYou may see that some of these\noptions are grayed out where you\n\n477\n00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,560\ncan't change them at all.\n\n478\n00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,060\n>> Mm-hm..\n\n479\n00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> That is true and\n\n480\n00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,450\nyou know with all the little\nshields next to everything,\n\n481\n00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,240\nthat is a surefire indicator that\nyou will need to have admin rights\n\n482\n00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,070\nto be able to change, change these things.\n\n483\n00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,180\nSo UAC will be invoked\nto change this stuff.\n\n484\n00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,940\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n485\n00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,080\n>> And now, the other feature behind this,\n\n486\n00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,650\nin, in a couple of ways here,\nis the one that doesn't have a shield,\n\n487\n00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,990\nwhich is right above it.\n\n488\n00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,700\nThe allow and app are featured\nthrough the firewall as well.\n\n489\n00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,090\nNow remember firewall is\nexactly like it sounds here.\n\n490\n00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,690\nAll the ports are really kind of closed\noff and what we want to come through.\n\n491\n00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,710\nWe actually allow to come through.\n\n492\n00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,010\nIt's like punching a hole\nthrough that firewall.\n\n493\n00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,380\nSo here it gives us the ability\nto be very granular.\n\n494\n00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,040\nIf I only want one app to go through,\nI can actually go ahead and\n\n495\n00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040\nadd that app in here.\n\n496\n00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,940\nNow, notice that there is a lot of\nthem that are actually on by default.\n\n497\n00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,120\nWindows 8 opens up more than\nI would normally say that's,\n\n498\n00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,340\nthat should be allowed.\n\n499\n00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,150\nEspecially with just\n\n500\n00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,980\nall the stuff that they come through\non that Windows Store that we have.\n\n501\n00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,270\nBut it gives you that\nability to control that.\n\n502\n00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,650\nIf you actually need\nan app to come through,\n\n503\n00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,520\nbecause your business wants it there.\n\n504\n00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,570\nAnd now only wants it to go through on the\ndomain setting but not on everything else.\n\n505\n00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,460\nYou can control that access here.\n\n506\n00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n507\n00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,580\n>> Yeah.\n\n508\n00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n509\n00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,915\nNow for, for some applications\nthat may not be, on this list.\n\n510\n00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:42,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> [COUGH] We'll say like, audacity here.\n\n511\n00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,310\nOf course, this audacity's a,\nan app v app.\n\n512\n00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,990\nSo, you know, so audacity it is not,\nnot in this list o,\n\n513\n00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,580\nof items, if you do have an application\nthere is a button here, allow other app.\n\n514\n00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,990\nYou can click on this and\nthere is audacity so\n\n515\n00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,910\nwe can now add this guy to the list.\n\n516\n00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,299\nAnd there he is up at the top and so\nnow we can control wether audacity has\n\n517\n00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,700\nconnections to the,\nyeah the three different network profiles.\n\n518\n00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,460\nWe could allow them on the domain and\non a private, lock him on the public.\n\n519\n00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> And yeah.\n\n520\n00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,870\n>> So on the one that we have\nset up here for audacity, right?\n\n521\n00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,048\nNotice that it means that if he is\nconnected into his work network,\n\n522\n00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:22,608\naudacity's allowed just fine.\n\n523\n00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:26,390\nBut on the other two that he doesn't\nhave checked, it's really not allowed.\n\n524\n00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,256\nSo that should, does give us\nthat granularity that we want so\n\n525\n00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:32,346\nthat if Nathan does bring his\nlaptop outside of the network here,\n\n526\n00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:35,815\ncuz he sits at Starbucks again,\naudacity may not be allowed to connect.\n\n527\n00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n528\n00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yep, now now so Ronnie and\n\n529\n00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,276\ni were having a little bit of fun before\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n530\n00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:44,690\n>> For the show with the, the steam app.\n\n531\n00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> The steam app wa, was pretty crazy.\n\n532\n00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,100\nSo, we would go into allow and\napp through.\n\n533\n00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,749\nWe would purposefully block the app\nfrom going through using this, the,\n\n534\n00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:57,370\nthe simple way and and\nsteam would add a new entry.\n\n535\n00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,842\nSo there would be stream and\nit would be blocked.\n\n536\n00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:01,680\nIt would add another entry\nbelow it that say, stream.\n\n537\n00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,022\nAnd it had all three profiles checked off.\n\n538\n00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:04,244\n>> Yeah.\n\n539\n00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:04,988\nUncheck it.\n\n540\n00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:08,617\nIf I had the same client, add yet\nanother thing on there, so\n\n541\n00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:10,950\nit was a a bit, persistent.\n\n542\n00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Persistent getting in there, but\n\n543\n00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,300\nwe did find a way that,\nwe did block this app.\n\n544\n00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,530\nAnd of course,\njust Steam being an example.\n\n545\n00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,690\nIt could be a, you know,\na bit torrent client, or a, you know,\n\n546\n00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,620\nsomething like that, running on a client\nmachine that we would want to block.\n\n547\n00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, we can use the Windows with\n\n548\n00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,420\nadvanced, the Windows Firewall with\nAdvanced Security to, block that guy.\n\n549\n00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,750\nAnd, and that's what it finally took,\nto block the Steam client.\n\n550\n00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,483\n>> Yeah.\n>> Um-hm.\n\n551\n00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:38,274\n>> And so that bring us to that other part\nof the firewall that we really want to\n\n552\n00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:39,450\ntake a look at here.\n\n553\n00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,187\nSo, Nathan, let, let's demonstrate\nwhat we're talking about here, and\n\n554\n00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:46,015\nthen we'll talk about this\nadvanced firewall, as well.\n\n555\n00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,360\n>> Mm-hm.\nSo it would, which part?\n\n556\n00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,300\n>> Just show them how to, Steam connects.\n\n557\n00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,005\nOr is, is, [CROSSTALK] in or not?\n\n558\n00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:51,934\n>> What?\n\n559\n00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:52,561\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n560\n00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:53,095\nYeah, yeah, yeah, it should connect.\n\n561\n00:24:53,095 --> 00:24:53,606\n>> All right.\n\n562\n00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:54,454\n>> I deleted all that rule out.\n\n563\n00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,500\nSo it should fire right up.\n\n564\n00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,030\n>> And once the guy connects up,\nsure enough, there we go, we have the,\n\n565\n00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,030\nthe Steam client.\n\n566\n00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,350\nNow the, the Steam client is a like a,\n\n567\n00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,470\na game portal\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n568\n00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,461\n>> You can use for\nplaying games buying games.\n\n569\n00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:10,140\n>> Look you can get a wick, weekend deal.\n\n570\n00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,840\n>> Yeah, we can deal.\n\n571\n00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,360\nI haven't, clicked through all the,\nnew deals yet today.\n\n572\n00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,950\nBut, so yeah, that,\nthat's the purpose of this now.\n\n573\n00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,120\nOn a, business environment,\n\n574\n00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,450\nyou may not want your client PCs running-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n575\n00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,980\n>> The, the Steam client, or, or maybe so.\n\n576\n00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,090\nIt could be a, you know,\n\n577\n00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,110\nwe might require it if you know you're\ngoing to have fun on lunch break.\n\n578\n00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,910\n>> Sure.\n\n579\n00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,930\n>> But yeah, so there we go.\n\n580\n00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,920\nSo it, it connects up and\neverything is is great.\n\n581\n00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,220\n>> So we weren't able to do this\nexactly like we wanted here.\n\n582\n00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,000\nBut we can still block this.\n\n583\n00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,460\nSo let's see what happens\nwhen Nathan goes and\n\n584\n00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,280\nshows us-\n>> Mm-hm\n\n585\n00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,620\n>> How we can block this thing.\n\n586\n00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,040\n>> All right, so are we going to\nget in to the advanced security and\n\n587\n00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,560\njust block the guy outright?\n\n588\n00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,252\n>> Yeah.\n\n589\n00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:52,380\nAll right, so, so to do this, like I said,\ngoing through this, this list here, and\n\n590\n00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,910\nit might already have\nmore than one in there.\n\n591\n00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,490\n>> Yep, there it is.\n\n592\n00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,410\n>> So we stopped at two, so we,\nwe, I haven't checked the domain,\n\n593\n00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,080\nwhich what we are on.\n\n594\n00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,612\nAnd when, it couldn't connect it added\nitself again, and gave himself all access.\n\n595\n00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,728\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which it didn't quite work,\n\n596\n00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:11,894\nI didn't see any settings in\nthere to I guess the UPNP.\n\n597\n00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:14,930\n>> Right.\n>> Or what not, to turn that stuff off.\n\n598\n00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,840\nWhat we can do, however,\nis go in to the advanced settings here.\n\n599\n00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,588\nAnd so this is the Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n600\n00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:28,040\nAnd we have a much more of a granular\ncontrol on what goes in and what goes out.\n\n601\n00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,370\nWe also can create custom rules and\nthose sorts of things.\n\n602\n00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,910\nWhich is what we will do for this one.\n\n603\n00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,209\nAnd for the outbound rules, so\nthis is traffic leaving the PC.\n\n604\n00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:41,849\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We will right-click on this guy, and\n\n605\n00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,490\nchoose a new rule.\n\n606\n00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:50,450\nAnd in the new rule here, we will choose\nto block a program from going out.\n\n607\n00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,640\nAnd there's you have ports predefined,\npredefined stuff,\n\n608\n00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,390\nso like a Remote Desktop, and\nNetwork File and Sharing, stuff in there.\n\n609\n00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,370\nWe can do a, a cust, you know,\nwe'll just do a custom rule.\n\n610\n00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:00,890\n>> Okay.\n\n611\n00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,650\n>> We'll do that.\n\n612\n00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,230\nClick on Next here.\n\n613\n00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:09,510\nAnd, so we can block by, program, program\npath, which we will do a program path.\n\n614\n00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,768\nAnd we'll just browse.\n\n615\n00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:13,740\nDa, da, da, all right, so\nyeah it found the location already.\n\n616\n00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,850\nSo, Program Files and\nwe'll go into the Steam, and\n\n617\n00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,800\nwe'll find that exe which\nI believe was this one.\n\n618\n00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:26,295\nOpen that guy up, and da,da, da.\n\n619\n00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,535\nSo we'll click on Next here.\n\n620\n00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:32,865\nAnd so we have the protocol type, protocol\nnumbers, the local ports, you know,\n\n621\n00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:36,585\nand, and for this one, we will just\nleave the, leave the, the defaults.\n\n622\n00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:40,215\nSo we could choose a certain protocol\nthat, is coming off of this client,\n\n623\n00:27:40,215 --> 00:27:44,270\nbut we're just gonna block\neverything off of this guy.\n\n624\n00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,060\nAll right, and so which,\n\n625\n00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,410\nwhich IPs I guess is getting a little more\ngranular than what I was looking for.\n\n626\n00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,790\nAnd so, we'll just straight\nup block the connection.\n\n627\n00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,610\n>> Sounds good.\n>> We choose to allow it,\n\n628\n00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,510\nallow, if it secure, we'll just block it.\n\n629\n00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,130\nAnd now we get to pick the domain\nprofiles onto which it, or,\n\n630\n00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,170\nthe network locations,\nit'll just choose all of them.\n\n631\n00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,865\nAnd then we'll just give it a name\nblock Steam and there we go.\n\n632\n00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:16,870\nSo there's that rule that's up there at\nthe top, and should be blocked, right?\n\n633\n00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,911\n>> Well, let's see.\n\n634\n00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:19,750\n>> All right, so\nwe'll go back into our client.\n\n635\n00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,130\nSure enough,\ncould not connect to the Steam network.\n\n636\n00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,380\nIt appears you are not currently\nconnected to the Internet.\n\n637\n00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,670\n>> Hm.\nThat's what it says.\n\n638\n00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,473\n>> Are you connected to the internet?\n\n639\n00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:30,135\n>> Pretty sure.\n\n640\n00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:31,632\n>> I see.\n>> Let's fire it up and go to MSN.\n\n641\n00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:32,770\n>> Up, there ya go, sure enough so.\n\n642\n00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,030\n>> So, so Steam, it,\nit doesn't see any internet.\n\n643\n00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,628\nWhy?\nWell because we are blocking it at our\n\n644\n00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:40,880\nfirewall from even getting out.\n\n645\n00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,590\n>> Yep.\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n646\n00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,550\n>> So it's pretty amazing that this\npiece of software can do this.\n\n647\n00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:50,230\nNow notice that we can block by the entire\napplication, which is really neat.\n\n648\n00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,660\nWe're right in time for our break right\nnow, but when we come back, we wanna show\n\n649\n00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,200\nyou that we can also block by individual\nprotocol or port numbers as well.\n\n650\n00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,350\nWe'll do a demonstration of that and\n\n651\n00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,560\nthen we'll talk about the idea\nof How we can block or\n\n652\n00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,070\nnot block but secure our traffic\nbetween two machines as well.\n\n653\n00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:10,122\n>> Sweet, so we, so we can get all that\nstuff right up here after the break.\n\n654\n00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:18,271\n[MUSIC]\n\n655\n00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,970\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n656\n00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,210\nAll right, so where we left\noff with the Windows Firewall.\n\n657\n00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,010\nWe've got a few more little\nmake-believe examples,\n\n658\n00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,730\nscenarios to go through\nabout blocking stuff.\n\n659\n00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,360\n>> Yeah, so right before the break\nwe took an application, Steam,\n\n660\n00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,200\nthe one that was running on,\non Nathan's computer here, and\n\n661\n00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,920\nblocked it from making\na connection outside.\n\n662\n00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,272\nSo that way when the when that\napplication tried to make a connection,\n\n663\n00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:46,987\nit says I don't think they're\neven connected to the Internet.\n\n664\n00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:50,460\nSo the firewall allowed us to\nblock that entire application.\n\n665\n00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,250\nSometimes we don't need to block\nthe entire application, but\n\n666\n00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,000\nI do need to block lets say\na specific port number, okay?\n\n667\n00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,380\nIs what we wanna do.\n\n668\n00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,090\nSo, let's go ahead and\ndo that demonstration right now, and\n\n669\n00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,815\nshow that this can be done\non that level as well, okay?\n\n670\n00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:04,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, Nathan,\n\n671\n00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,800\nI'm gonna ask if you'll connect to my web\nserver that I've set up on my machine.\n\n672\n00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,050\n>> You're running a web server inside?\n\n673\n00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,050\n>> I am running a,\na web server on my machine.\n\n674\n00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,900\n>> Is that authorized?\n\n675\n00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,870\n>> It is not authorized.\n\n676\n00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,110\n>> All right.\n\n677\n00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,024\nLet me click here and go here.\n\n678\n00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:25,653\n[NOISE] all right.\n\n679\n00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:28,045\n>> There it is.\n>> 10.10.5.222?\n\n680\n00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:28,637\n>> Yep.\n\n681\n00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:32,840\n[SOUND]\n>> Oh see some protection already.\n\n682\n00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,060\n>> Will my domain credentials work?\n\n683\n00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,386\n>> It should.\n\n684\n00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:40,536\n>> Look at that, okay.\n>> Yeah.\n\n685\n00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:42,626\n>> Now I didn't set this up as fancy,\nit's just a default.\n\n686\n00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:43,840\n>> All right, like.\n\n687\n00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,580\nCool website.\n\n688\n00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,190\nLooks familiar.\n\n689\n00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,600\n>> I know, yeah.\nIsn't that, isn't that awesome?\n\n690\n00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,640\n>> Yeah, it looks default.\n\n691\n00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,710\n>> Yeah, it is default.\n\n692\n00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,385\nIt's as default as it\ngoes in terms of IIS.\n\n693\n00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:52,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Here, which is the,\n\n694\n00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,235\nthe Windows web serve version for us.\n\n695\n00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:59,485\nNow, normally of course, we would not want\n\n696\n00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:04,555\nusers to be running their own web\nservers internally on our network, okay?\n\n697\n00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:07,100\nSo we want to actually\njust block that one out.\n\n698\n00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,000\nWe don't need to block everything,\n\n699\n00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,410\nlike I don't need to block\nInternet Explorer, okay?\n\n700\n00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,300\nFrom actually running,\n\n701\n00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,970\nI just need to block that from actually\nbeing a destination port for us.\n\n702\n00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:23,470\nSo, inside of the Windows Firewall,\nif I go to my computer, if I can find it.\n\n703\n00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,570\n>> It's right in front of you, Ronnie.\n\n704\n00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,390\n>> It it certainly is.\n\n705\n00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,010\nOh, fire,\nI thought you meant your home PC.\n\n706\n00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,938\n>> Oh, of course you did.\n\n707\n00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:30,658\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n708\n00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:31,412\n>> Cuz that's the way it is.\n\n709\n00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:37,409\nAll right, that's not what I was\nlooking for, but that will work.\n\n710\n00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:43,110\nAll right so I just went back out here and\nover on the left hand side where I have\n\n711\n00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,810\nthe Windows Firewall,\nI'm looking for advanced settings.\n\n712\n00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,940\nThat brings me into the Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security.\n\n713\n00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:57,038\nAnd then inside of the Advanced Security I\ngo to Inbound rules.\n\n714\n00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,560\nAnd, if I scroll all\nthe way down to the bottom.\n\n715\n00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,291\nThere is a default rule that was here.\n\n716\n00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,770\nAnd it is turned off by default, okay?\n\n717\n00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,920\nSo in other words, if you actually\nhave a rule that's in here, and\n\n718\n00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,725\nit's off, it means it's going to block it.\n\n719\n00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,690\n'Kay, by default that's actually it.\n\n720\n00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,990\nNow I opened it up to allow for\nNate to, to be able to connect in and\n\n721\n00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,160\nsome other people.\n\n722\n00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,780\nBut if I wanted to, I could simply right\nclick, and I could disable that rule.\n\n723\n00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,050\nNow what if I wanted to actually just\ndisable it, not for everyone, but\n\n724\n00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,460\njust for Nathan?\n\n725\n00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,510\nI could go in here to Properties.\n\n726\n00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,560\nYep.\n\n727\n00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,150\nAnd notice all of the different properties\nthat we have acc, accessible here.\n\n728\n00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,130\nRight now it says I can allow\nthe connection to come through.\n\n729\n00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,330\nI could've simply left it on and\nselected block if I wanted to,\n\n730\n00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,600\nand that would've stopped it as well.\n\n731\n00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,430\nI can go in here to, where am I?\n\n732\n00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,130\nI'm look, oh look!\n\n733\n00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,780\nScope.\n\n734\n00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,482\nSo it's right here that\nI could actually say,\n\n735\n00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:59,860\na local computer on remote IP addresses.\n\n736\n00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,620\nIf I knew what Nathan's actual\nremote IP address good,\n\n737\n00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,560\nI could actually block it from there, but\nnot block anybody else if I wanted to.\n\n738\n00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,750\n>> I could tell you if you wanted.\n\n739\n00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,550\n>> No, thank you.\n\n740\n00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,085\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah.\n\n741\n00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,670\n[LAUGH] I know what it is,\nI'm just joking.\n\n742\n00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,510\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n743\n00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,840\n>> But, we can actually do that.\n\n744\n00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840\nSo, we're just showing the scope here.\n\n745\n00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,650\nTo show how we can actually do\nthis if we wanted to as well.\n\n746\n00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,270\nSo notice you have the same option.\n\n747\n00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,210\nNow, you're looking at this like\nwhy does this sound familiar?\n\n748\n00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,930\nWell, the rule that Nathan created\nat the beginning to block steam\n\n749\n00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,710\nactually fills in all the content here.\n\n750\n00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,070\nSo lets say that you go through and\nyou create the default or\n\n751\n00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:38,870\na custom role really quickly, but you go\nhey I need to actually do it this way.\n\n752\n00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,390\nYou can always go back in and\nchange the actual connections here.\n\n753\n00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,480\nUsually a lot of times what\nyou want is really right here.\n\n754\n00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,759\nAnd I could have let it on and\nselected block this connection here.\n\n755\n00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,620\nAnd that would have actually\ndone it as well, okay?\n\n756\n00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,370\nSo notice, we can enable it, if we want\nto and block the connection, you name it.\n\n757\n00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,590\nThere's several different things,\n\n758\n00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,930\nbut having the scope option can really\nmake it incredibly granular, okay?\n\n759\n00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:09,260\nNot only block the idea of anybody\nconnecting, but just one IP address or\n\n760\n00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,330\na particular range of IP\naddresses is pretty neat.\n\n761\n00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,530\nAnd even,\nnotice that authorized computers and\n\n762\n00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,090\nexceptions says only allow these\nconnections from these computers.\n\n763\n00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,655\nWe can limit it in that way as well.\n\n764\n00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:21,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n765\n00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,930\n>> So there's a lot of options\nthat we actually have here.\n\n766\n00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,850\nOkay.\n\n767\n00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,510\nSo let me see, what did I wanna do.\n\n768\n00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,420\nOh, I just turned it off.\n\n769\n00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,330\nLet me turn it back on here.\n\n770\n00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,900\nAnd then let's go ahead and\njust block it in this way.\n\n771\n00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,740\nSo normally it is off by default.\n\n772\n00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,340\nThey don't really want\nanybody running this thing.\n\n773\n00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,940\nSo if I just go ahead and\nblock the connection, all right.\n\n774\n00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,840\nNow let's see now,\nif Nathan closes out of his web browser,\n\n775\n00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,157\nlet's see if he can connect\nback in at this point.\n\n776\n00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:52,900\nAlright [COUGH] so,\nfire good old Internet Explorer back up\n\n777\n00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,176\nand http://10.\n\n778\n00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:58,924\nRight there.\n\n779\n00:34:58,924 --> 00:34:59,971\nUh-oh.\n\n780\n00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:01,020\nUh-oh.\n\n781\n00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,240\n>> Oh, that's not good.\n\n782\n00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,670\n>> Nope.\n>> Maybe I should've asked you\n\n783\n00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,660\nto disable that then.\n\n784\n00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,940\n>> Hm.\n>> Well, that's not good.\n\n785\n00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,339\nLet's try it with it disabled then.\n\n786\n00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,890\nI wonder why it actually allowed\nme to go through, that's weird.\n\n787\n00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,890\n>> Was it cached?\n\n788\n00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,090\n>> It may be cached,\ndid you close out of the browser?\n\n789\n00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,470\n>> Yes, I did.\n\n790\n00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,000\n>> Well, it shouldn't.\n\n791\n00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,755\nLet's try it again.\n\n792\n00:35:18,755 --> 00:35:21,370\n[LAUGH] I just disabled.\n\n793\n00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,085\n>> All right,\nI'll try in InPrivate browsing.\n\n794\n00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:27,185\n[SOUND]\n>> It allows you back in,\n\n795\n00:35:27,185 --> 00:35:27,856\nI don't know what we did.\n\n796\n00:35:27,856 --> 00:35:32,568\nIt was working before, I know that.\n\n797\n00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:35,739\nhttp://10.\n\n798\n00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:38,007\nright there.\n\n799\n00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:40,280\n[COUGH]\nWell,\n\n800\n00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,080\nI'd say it's not working is a better sign.\n\n801\n00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,300\n>> You know, that's actually another\none that we might have, yeah.\n\n802\n00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,452\nSo in this sense, I don't know why the\nblock and actually leaving it open didn't\n\n803\n00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:53,950\nactually work, but\ndisabling the role worked very easily.\n\n804\n00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,020\nAnd like I said, that's what you would\nnormally have by default anyways.\n\n805\n00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:02,050\nSo we can block it on a port or by\nthe individual application as well, okay?\n\n806\n00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:05,200\nSo being able to block the traffic that\nwe need to block is actually really good.\n\n807\n00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,100\nWe showed you an outbound\nrule on the application.\n\n808\n00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,280\nWe then showed you an inbound\nrule here on the port number.\n\n809\n00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,900\nDon't forget there's a lot of options\nwhen you do create these rules here,\n\n810\n00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,580\nusually inside of a domain.\n\n811\n00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,990\nIt tells you that the rule that you're\nprobably gonna create is that first one,\n\n812\n00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,260\nthat's an isolation rule.\n\n813\n00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,300\nIn other words,\n\n814\n00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,735\nyou're pinpointing the target that you\nwant to actually build a connect back in.\n\n815\n00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:26,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n816\n00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,640\n>> So when you do this now Nathan created\na custom rule, which is perfectly fine.\n\n817\n00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,580\nAnd here again if you select Program and\nthe net, what am I doing?\n\n818\n00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,460\nI'm doing the wrong thing, aren't I?\n\n819\n00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,050\n>> I'm not sure.\n\n820\n00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,590\n>> What was, no,\nI think I was doing the wrong one again.\n\n821\n00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,300\nI think my mind went on to\nthe connection security rules.\n\n822\n00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,820\n>> Oh, really?\n\n823\n00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,620\n>> That I was going to.\n\n824\n00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,351\nAnd since we're actually there,\ngood time to talk about it.\n\n825\n00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:50,954\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.\n\n826\n00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:52,481\n>> My fault.\n>> Which one, connection security rules?\n\n827\n00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:53,740\n>> Connection security rules.\n\n828\n00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,160\n>> Connection security rules.\n\n829\n00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,310\nThese are ways that we can set up,\ncertain rules, and\n\n830\n00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:03,560\ncertain things to apply when\na connection is, is, is being made.\n\n831\n00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,100\nWe'll set it up to yeah for IPsec.\n\n832\n00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,310\nSo we'll use the good old\nIPsec to secure stuff,\n\n833\n00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:16,330\nand yeah, I guess secure that traffic\nas it goes out onto the wire.\n\n834\n00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,952\nAnd keep those eavesdroppers.\n\n835\n00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,741\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Those man in the middle guys from\n\n836\n00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,352\nintercepting our data.\n\n837\n00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:25,250\n>> All right, so, since we've talked\nabout the idea of, of IPsec here,\n\n838\n00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,395\nwe might as well go ahead and,\nalso describe it if I can.\n\n839\n00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:28,938\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n840\n00:37:28,938 --> 00:37:33,514\n>> So let me bring up my computer and just\nmake a couple of notes here as we go on.\n\n841\n00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:34,892\nWell, maybe.\n\n842\n00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:35,392\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n843\n00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:41,228\n>> Excellent.\n\n844\n00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:43,353\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah my computer's\nworking really fast today.\n\n845\n00:37:43,353 --> 00:37:45,936\n>> Yeah and your, your mouse.\n\n846\n00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:48,902\nThat's crazy how the [CROSSTALK]\nmouse is just so far off.\n\n847\n00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,556\n>> Yeah, who would've guessed.\n\n848\n00:37:50,556 --> 00:37:52,140\n>> Good old IVGA software.\n\n849\n00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,830\n>> Yep.\n\n850\n00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,280\nAlright so, since Nathan mentioned this.\n\n851\n00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,075\nConnection security rules.\n\n852\n00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n853\n00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,280\n>> Okay,\nthey essentially help us to do what?\n\n854\n00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,220\nThey help us to provide a secured\nconnection between two end points.\n\n855\n00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,065\n>> That was a good way of putting it,\n\n856\n00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,030\nRonnie\n>> Thank you.\n\n857\n00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,500\n>> Yeah, you're welcome.\n\n858\n00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,000\n>> You and that grammar.\n\n859\n00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:15,280\nHm.\n\n860\n00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,880\nWe're between two end points\nthat we actually have.\n\n861\n00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,670\nNow, when we do this, right,\nthe way that we provide that\n\n862\n00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,210\nis that we need the idea of\nsomething that can provide it for\n\n863\n00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,355\nus, we of coursecall Authentication,\nokay, or Origin Authentication here.\n\n864\n00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:33,565\nWe need the ability to provide data\nintegrity and we need the ability,\n\n865\n00:38:33,565 --> 00:38:38,195\nof course, to provide privacy\nbetween our two, devices here.\n\n866\n00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:41,375\nNow Origin Authentication\nwhat is that about?\n\n867\n00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:45,565\nThat ensures that the device that sent\nit is actually who he says sent it.\n\n868\n00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:49,540\nWe also need a way to verify that\ndata goes through that connection,\n\n869\n00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,030\nthat the data that was sent is\nthe same data that arrived.\n\n870\n00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:58,300\nAnd lastly, we need the ability to hide\nthat data as it's traversing or crossing\n\n871\n00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,810\nour connection in between so that nobody\ncan do the man in the middle attacks.\n\n872\n00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,390\nOr the actual eavesdropping\nattacks as well.\n\n873\n00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,210\nSo that's what it needs to provide.\n\n874\n00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:12,150\nThe way that we provide that in\nour networks here is by using what\n\n875\n00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,700\nNate mentioned here,\nwhich a lot of people call IPsec.\n\n876\n00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,860\nNate called it IPsec.\n\n877\n00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,760\nOther people call it IPsec as well.\n\n878\n00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,930\nSo, that's what, what we'll call it here.\n\n879\n00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,880\nWe'll call it IPsec,\nto help Nate out, okay?\n\n880\n00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:30,300\nSo, IPsec for us, IPsec here,\nstands for IP security.\n\n881\n00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,760\nThis is the type of security that is used,\non the Internet.\n\n882\n00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,760\nBetween two different networks here,\nour traffic, is going to,\n\n883\n00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,580\ngo across a public network, and\n\n884\n00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,450\nwe're going to use IPsec to essentially\nsecure that traffic between them.\n\n885\n00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,230\nNow on the Internet,\n\n886\n00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,680\nbecause you have thousands of miles\nin between some these routers,\n\n887\n00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,180\nor even hundreds of miles, you have\ntwenty or thirty routers you're crossing.\n\n888\n00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,736\nHow do you know, the data that left one\nnetwork over on router number 1, data\n\n889\n00:39:57,736 --> 00:40:03,830\narrives on a another network at router\nnumber 25, is actually that same network?\n\n890\n00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,680\nYou have to provide a way to do that.\n\n891\n00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,920\nSame thing in terms of the data that's\ngone through 20 different routers.\n\n892\n00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,810\nHow do you know that that data's\nthe same as when it left?\n\n893\n00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,280\nAnd how can we protect that across\n\n894\n00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,680\nmillions of people possibly\nlooking at that data going across.\n\n895\n00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,320\nWell IPsec here does that.\n\n896\n00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,740\nNow there's an easy way I remember\nwhat IPsec actually provides you.\n\n897\n00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,255\nI say, easy, it's easy for me.\n\n898\n00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:28,550\nMm-hm, you the man.\n\n899\n00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,710\nK, and it's actually an acronym, that,\nthat ends up forming out here, okay?\n\n900\n00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,220\n>> H.\n>> Yep.\n\n901\n00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,490\nH, here actually gives us\nthe idea of hashing, okay?\n\n902\n00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,220\nSo we need a hash value here, okay?\n\n903\n00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,570\nNow hash for\nus is a unique code that is generated\n\n904\n00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,610\nwhen we run our data through\nsome type of hashing algorithm.\n\n905\n00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,460\nAnd it generates what we call a fixed\nlength hash that can really only be, a,\n\n906\n00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,520\nagain, if you actually run that same\nmathematical algorithm at the receiving\n\n907\n00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,370\nend, okay,\nyou should come out with the same value.\n\n908\n00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,560\nAny change in it would actually be, again,\n\n909\n00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,420\na different value that\nyou'd come out with.\n\n910\n00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,280\nSo you'd pick a hashing,\nalgorithm there to help you out.\n\n911\n00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,750\nThe other thing that we need\nhere is what we call encryption.\n\n912\n00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,010\nSo to be able to protect our data\nwe need some type of symmetric\n\n913\n00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,610\nencryption algorithm.\n\n914\n00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,420\nThat again helps us to provide for\nthe privacy of our data going in between.\n\n915\n00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,090\nWe also need authentication.\n\n916\n00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,470\nI misspelled it, of course.\n\n917\n00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,390\nOkay, authentication.\n\n918\n00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,680\nWhat method are we going to use?\n\n919\n00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,690\nWe actually have many different\nmethods that we can use here.\n\n920\n00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,190\nWhen we do it, we're going to use just\na pre-shared key, which is, of course,\n\n921\n00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,270\nthe one they don't recommend, but it's\nthe easiest one for us to set up here.\n\n922\n00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:46,839\n>> Yep.\n[LAUGH]\n\n923\n00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,490\n>> So we're gonna use a pre-shared key.\n\n924\n00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:52,710\nAnd then, lastly for\nus, [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n925\n00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,702\nWe need what we call the idea of\n\n926\n00:41:57,702 --> 00:42:04,306\na Diffie Hellman group number, okay?\n\n927\n00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:08,580\nNow there are many different strengths\nhere, but this is about how in the world\n\n928\n00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,853\ndo we actually have the public and private\nkey that we need to be able to exchange\n\n929\n00:42:12,853 --> 00:42:17,877\ndata without actually sending any private\ninformation across a network connection.\n\n930\n00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:20,141\nSo there are different groups of this and\nnot so\n\n931\n00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:22,325\nimportant that we actually know every one.\n\n932\n00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:25,600\nYou're gonna see it's gonna default to I\nthink two is the one that we're going to\n\n933\n00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,550\nactually have here that\nit's going to default to.\n\n934\n00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,890\nAnd on that one then you also have\nthe idea of a time limit or a timeout.\n\n935\n00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:36,480\nIn other words how long is this\nconnection by default going to last?\n\n936\n00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,580\nMost of them actually last for\nabout a day or\n\n937\n00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,580\nan hour, I can't remember which one\nit actually does here on Windows.\n\n938\n00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:48,520\nSo, usually on default, I know in\nCisco it's like about 28,400 seconds,\n\n939\n00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,200\nor the other one, 24,800 seconds, whatever\na day equals to in terms of seconds here.\n\n940\n00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,820\nSo, you actually can have that.\n\n941\n00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:01,595\nSo here, you actually see, that with us\nhere, when you have that you have head\n\n942\n00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:07,220\nH-E-A-D, and that's how I actually know\nin terms of, of how to this happens.\n\n943\n00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,100\nMm-hm, yeah, that's true, no.\n\n944\n00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,470\n>> Sweet.\nThat's nice seeing Ronnie as a,\n\n945\n00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:17,620\na a matter of fact, the so these virtual\nmachines that we're using are off site\n\n946\n00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,410\nand we're actually communicating to these\nvirtual machines through an IPsec tunnel.\n\n947\n00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,610\n>> We are.\n\n948\n00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,130\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's pretty darn cool.\n\n949\n00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,240\n>> Yeah, it is pretty cool.\n\n950\n00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,871\n>> Yeah, so, so here we go.\n\n951\n00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:31,070\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna show you how to set this up.\n\n952\n00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,480\nNow when we set this up both sides,\n\n953\n00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,438\nthe virtual machine that's on Nathan's\ncomputer and the one that's on mine.\n\n954\n00:43:37,438 --> 00:43:41,070\nThey're gonna end up forming a secured\nconnection between them, and then we're\n\n955\n00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,370\ngonna actually encrypt the data that's\ngoing through that connection as well.\n\n956\n00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:47,010\nThe key here is to remember that\nwe need a mirrored configuration.\n\n957\n00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,980\nSo, Nate you want to demonstrate that for\nus?\n\n958\n00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,215\nAnd I'll kind of mirror\nyou on the other side.\n\n959\n00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:51,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n960\n00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,910\n>> Is what I'll do.\n\n961\n00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,380\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n962\n00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,564\nSo on so on the computer here,\nwe'll [SOUND] all right, so\n\n963\n00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:05,228\nwe got to get back into good old\nControl Panel and System and Security,\n\n964\n00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:11,188\nWindows Firewall, Advanced Settings,\noh gosh, long, lot of clicks.\n\n965\n00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:16,123\nAll right, and now, it's, okay, so to set\nthis thing up [COUGH] we need to start off\n\n966\n00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:18,604\ngoing to the connection security rules.\n\n967\n00:44:18,604 --> 00:44:23,010\nAnd we will right-click on that and\nchoose New Rule.\n\n968\n00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,020\nAnd, and, you know, some of these steps\nwill look a little, a little familiar.\n\n969\n00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:33,230\nSo, of these types that we have,\nthe isolation,\n\n970\n00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:39,910\nwe have authentication exemption, server\nto server, tunnel and custom rule and\n\n971\n00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,820\ndepending on what kind of connection\nsecurity that you're looking for,\n\n972\n00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:48,420\nyou know, for us, we're just gonna choose\ncustom, cuz we're all about custom, right?\n\n973\n00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,786\nCustom install, or custom whatever.\n\n974\n00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:52,956\nAll right, so now, we have,\nwhich computers are in the,\n\n975\n00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,770\nthe different end points.\n\n976\n00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,720\nAll right, so, for us, for my end\npoint one, I'm going to choose myself.\n\n977\n00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,940\nSo, I am one end point.\n\n978\n00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:07,480\nAll right, so I'll click on add, and\nI'll put in my own IP address 221.\n\n979\n00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,140\nAll right, and click okay.\n\n980\n00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,678\nAnd so, who is the other endpoint?\n\n981\n00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:18,007\nWell, we'll be creating a,\na IPsec connection to Ronny's computer.\n\n982\n00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:22,930\nAll right, and so,\nwe will choose these IP addresses.\n\n983\n00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,200\nClick on, Add, and\nI will add in his numbers.\n\n984\n00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,021\nSo, 1010.5.222.\n\n985\n00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:34,860\nAll right, now, [COUGH] now let's\nsay if this was a some kind\n\n986\n00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:40,180\nof server that was hosting you know, so,\nfor which computers are in in point two,\n\n987\n00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,050\nor whether it's listening or,\nor going out to.\n\n988\n00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,445\nWe could choose any IP address.\n\n989\n00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:47,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So then any connection coming into our\n\n990\n00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,005\nPC would have to be secure.\n\n991\n00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:50,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> In that situation we could use any IP\n\n992\n00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:56,790\naddress, but for this example,\nwe'll go and define our addresses.\n\n993\n00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,280\n>> Yeah, now, on my end,\nit just switched it around it, right?\n\n994\n00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,110\nSo, my first endpoint is my IP address.\n\n995\n00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:05,116\nThis second endpoint is Nate's IP address.\n\n996\n00:46:05,116 --> 00:46:05,888\n>> All right?\n\n997\n00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,790\n[COUGH] And then, clicking on through.\n\n998\n00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,895\nSo, now, we have the, these,\nthese different settings.\n\n999\n00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Request authentication for\n\n1000\n00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,205\ninbound and outbound.\n\n1001\n00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:14,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, this will be so,\n\n1002\n00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,320\nwhen the connection is is, is being made,\nit's just gonna request and say,\n\n1003\n00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,710\nhey is this is this gonna be secure?\n\n1004\n00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:23,560\nIf it is, great.\n\n1005\n00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:27,490\nIf not, that's all right,\njust go ahead and, and do it anyways.\n\n1006\n00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:31,940\nThe next item I require, authentication\nfor inbound connections, and\n\n1007\n00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,930\nrequest it for, for outbound.\n\n1008\n00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,815\nSo, I'll say, hey, if you're gonna be\ntalking to me, it better be secured.\n\n1009\n00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:40,620\nBut going out talking back to you\nit doesn't really have to be.\n\n1010\n00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,505\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1011\n00:46:41,505 --> 00:46:46,085\n>> And then the third one there require\nauthentication for inbound and outbound.\n\n1012\n00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:50,130\nSo both ways must be secured for\nthis connection to happen.\n\n1013\n00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,335\nAnd then the very last one,\ndo not authenticate.\n\n1014\n00:46:52,335 --> 00:46:52,960\n>> Okay.\n\n1015\n00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,720\n>> So, so what we're gonna do,\nwe'll just choose the top one, just,\n\n1016\n00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,140\nwe're just gonna request it.\n\n1017\n00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,210\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1018\n00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,460\n>> All right, and now for\nthe authentication method.\n\n1019\n00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:05,550\nSo how are we going to prove\nwho we are to, to one another?\n\n1020\n00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:09,400\nYou know,\nwe could use the we could use that stuff.\n\n1021\n00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,420\nAnd, you know, for us, advanced, right?\n\n1022\n00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,450\nDon't you always click advanced for\neverything?\n\n1023\n00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,856\n>> Absolutely.\n>> We'll click on customize.\n\n1024\n00:47:16,856 --> 00:47:19,750\nNow for, for this stuff here, so\n\n1025\n00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:26,440\nwe have two types of authentication,\nor two, two different ones here.\n\n1026\n00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We'll just click on\n\n1027\n00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,010\nadd here to add one.\n\n1028\n00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,632\nAnd so we've got the Curb ROS,\nwe've got the, NTLM.\n\n1029\n00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:38,690\nWe have the, computer certificates,\nwhich I think typically, what you know,\n\n1030\n00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:42,570\nbusiness in the environments, what they\nwould want is the use certificates to\n\n1031\n00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,330\nsecure the stuff but for us,\nfirst things you do is a pre-shared key.\n\n1032\n00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,470\nAnd for our pre-shared key,\nwe'll just put in password.\n\n1033\n00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,793\nAll lowercase password.\n\n1034\n00:47:51,793 --> 00:47:52,570\n>> Okay.\n\n1035\n00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,130\n>> And now for any, so for\n\n1036\n00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,840\nRonny's computer, he would have to\nuse the exact same pre-shared key.\n\n1037\n00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,980\nThis is how we're going to\nauthenticate each other.\n\n1038\n00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,232\nSo when t, goes back up, I say hey,\nwhat is that pre-shared key?\n\n1039\n00:48:06,232 --> 00:48:08,634\nWhat is, what is the password, okay?\n\n1040\n00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:10,437\nIs it password, oh yeah it is password.\n\n1041\n00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:12,195\n>> Yeah.\nWe agree, sweet.\n\n1042\n00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:14,476\n>> Yeah, when,\nwhen you start troubleshooting this,\n\n1043\n00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:17,930\nthis is one of the key components that\npeople do miss, because of typos, right?\n\n1044\n00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:22,120\nUsually, a lot of times, because this\nwizard walks us through it, we may again\n\n1045\n00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,555\njust kind of fat finger it and, and\nthat's where we have a problem on this,\n\n1046\n00:48:25,555 --> 00:48:27,145\nso, so\nthere's one of those configurations.\n\n1047\n00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:30,495\nNow, if you're wondering like why do\nthey list two authentication methods?\n\n1048\n00:48:30,495 --> 00:48:32,025\nEverything but the preshared key does.\n\n1049\n00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:36,515\nAnd that's because you can have\nmultiple different tries here.\n\n1050\n00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:40,400\nSo in other words, as long as one of\nthose policies on the other end matches\n\n1051\n00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,310\nYou may be connecting to a machine\nthat actually also has different\n\n1052\n00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:46,870\nmultiple policies already set up because\nit's actually connecting to, well,\n\n1053\n00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:50,280\ndifferent machines that require\ndifferent security settings.\n\n1054\n00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,860\nSo on your end, if you actually are using\none of those other authentication methods,\n\n1055\n00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,260\nyou can try one and be like oh, okay.\n\n1056\n00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,880\nThat doesn't match, then I'll go and\ntry another one, and the same thing here.\n\n1057\n00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,200\nWe can actually go ahead and\nset up those as well.\n\n1058\n00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,760\nBut for us, when we use a preshared key,\n\n1059\n00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,220\nit's not gonna give us another\nchance to use another preshared key.\n\n1060\n00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,775\nAnd that's why we only have one here.\n\n1061\n00:49:07,775 --> 00:49:08,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1062\n00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,725\nYeah, you know, and on the the second\nauthentication over there.\n\n1063\n00:49:11,725 --> 00:49:12,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It says\n\n1064\n00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:16,550\nspecify user authentication methods or\na health certificate.\n\n1065\n00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,400\n>> There you go.\n\n1066\n00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,140\n>> A health certificate, that would be\nthe part of the network access protection.\n\n1067\n00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,760\n>> That's right.\n\n1068\n00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,990\n>> Which as a matter of fact, I,\n\n1069\n00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:26,945\nI believe in the next set of objectives-\n>> Yeah, it's coming up.\n\n1070\n00:49:26,945 --> 00:49:28,269\n>> It is coming up,\nto troubleshoot that stuff?\n\n1071\n00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:31,030\n>> That's right\n>> More of, that good stuff to come later.\n\n1072\n00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,450\nAnd with the pre-shared key, right,\nwe just hit once, we'll say OK to that.\n\n1073\n00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,930\nAnd we're back to this menu,\nso we'll click on Next.\n\n1074\n00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,880\nAlright, so now this is,\nwhich, which protocol type, so\n\n1075\n00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,840\nwhichever protocol Then is,\nis sending out, it will invoke this\n\n1076\n00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:51,670\nthe connection security rule and\nlook to secure this, this connection.\n\n1077\n00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:56,718\nAnd for the sake of our example here,\nwe're gonna choose good old ICMPv4.\n\n1078\n00:49:56,718 --> 00:49:58,987\nNow Ronnie, what is ICMPv4?\n\n1079\n00:49:58,987 --> 00:50:00,145\n>> That's our pings.\n\n1080\n00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:01,675\n>> Pings.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1081\n00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:02,805\n>> Correct.\n\n1082\n00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:04,625\nAll right, so we're, we're-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1083\n00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:05,327\n>> We're gonna,\n\n1084\n00:50:05,327 --> 00:50:08,822\nwe're gonna build up an IP set\nconnection for ping traffic.\n\n1085\n00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:10,942\nNow, what do we have going on here, okay?\n\n1086\n00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:16,372\nBefore the actual tunnel connection can be\nbuilt up, right, the rule on one side or\n\n1087\n00:50:16,372 --> 00:50:21,072\nthe other has to be able to identify\nwhat has to go through that connection.\n\n1088\n00:50:21,072 --> 00:50:25,100\nSo normally what happens here is that if\nwe don't specify anything, that means any\n\n1089\n00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,770\ntraffic that is made between those two\nconnections will build that tunnel up.\n\n1090\n00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,040\nBy specifying this we're\nactually identifying what we call\n\n1091\n00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,520\ninteresting traffic.\n\n1092\n00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,500\nIs what we're doing.\n\n1093\n00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,400\nWe're saying only trigger that\ntunnel connection if this type of\n\n1094\n00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,740\ntraffic goes across.\n\n1095\n00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,698\nEvery other connection is\nnot going to be secure.\n\n1096\n00:50:39,698 --> 00:50:40,635\nMm-hm.\n\n1097\n00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,970\nYep.\n>> All right, so, choose, yep.\n\n1098\n00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:43,680\nChoose that guy.\n\n1099\n00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,370\nWe'll click on Next.\n\n1100\n00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,220\nAll right, and then now, it's the which\nnetwork locations are gonna be on for\n\n1101\n00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,740\nthis connection security\nrule to be active.\n\n1102\n00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,990\nAnd for this one, we're just\ngonna choose all three for ours.\n\n1103\n00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,850\nWe'll click on Next,\n\n1104\n00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:01,670\nand we'll give it a, a name,\nwhich I'll just call this one, crypt ping.\n\n1105\n00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:02,710\nSo just short and sweet.\n\n1106\n00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,460\nAll right, crypt ping and\nwe'll click on Finish, and there we go.\n\n1107\n00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,890\nSo let me minimize firewall.\n\n1108\n00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:13,210\nAll right, so for\nour connection security rule, there we go.\n\n1109\n00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,770\nSo there's our, our name, our crypt rule.\n\n1110\n00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:16,648\nIt is enabled.\n\n1111\n00:51:16,648 --> 00:51:19,280\nThere's Endpoint 1, Endpoint 2 are out.\n\n1112\n00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,980\nAuthentication method, mode,\nend points, yada yada.\n\n1113\n00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,470\nProtocol.\n\n1114\n00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,870\nSweet.\n\n1115\n00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,440\nAlright, there we go.\n\n1116\n00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,160\n>> So,\nnow that we have this rule in place, okay.\n\n1117\n00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,870\nIf we were to go ahead and try and\nsee if this tunnel is made.\n\n1118\n00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,360\nWe can go back in, and we can look\nunderneath the connection security rules.\n\n1119\n00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,920\nWhere it says monitoring.\n\n1120\n00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,990\nOkay, so let's see.\n\n1121\n00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,520\n>> I'm just clicking through.\n\n1122\n00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,150\n>> Okay.\n\n1123\n00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,880\nAll right.\nSo over here on the left hand side\n\n1124\n00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,940\nwhere you see the term monitoring over\nhere, if I can go to the connection, or\n\n1125\n00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,500\nactually the security associations, and\n\n1126\n00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:58,740\nthe main mode, notice nothing is actually\nappearing right here at this point.\n\n1127\n00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,970\nSo, I'm a little bit disappointed Nate,\nthat\n\n1128\n00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:06,600\nthat I don't actually have a tunnel being\nbuilt up between my computer and yours.\n\n1129\n00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,000\n>> Oh, Ronnie because we need\nthat interesting traffic.\n\n1130\n00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,195\n>> We need the interesting traffic.\n\n1131\n00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:10,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So,\n\n1132\n00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,825\nwithout the interesting traffic, the,\nthe tunnel is not actually created here.\n\n1133\n00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:14,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1134\n00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,820\n>> So, let's go ahead and\ngenerate some interesting traffic and\n\n1135\n00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,250\nlet's see what we have here.\n\n1136\n00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,110\nYou want me to ping?\n\n1137\n00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:23,850\n>> Yeah and you know and, and real quick\nRon so with the with the main mode and\n\n1138\n00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:28,060\nthe quick mode, right so the way this\nIPsec is going to work, we have the,\n\n1139\n00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:33,970\nthe main mode that will, build that,\nthe like the initial connection.\n\n1140\n00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,740\nI'm sure you have all the right words to\nuse, but it's going to use that main mode\n\n1141\n00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:41,710\nto to establish it and then it, once\nthey've agreed on it, then they'll use a,\n\n1142\n00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:47,090\na faster, algorithm, or\na faster method for the quick mode.\n\n1143\n00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,680\n>> All right.\n>> And they'll use that quick one to,\n\n1144\n00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,030\nsend everything.\n\n1145\n00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,080\n>> Yup.\nFor us to generate what we actually\n\n1146\n00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,620\nneed to here.\n\n1147\n00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,460\nRight?\n\n1148\n00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,570\nThe idea of when you see the,\nthe main mode and\n\n1149\n00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,580\nthe quick mode here, okay, one generates\nthe establishment where they exchange and\n\n1150\n00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:04,660\nthey agree on how this connection is\ngoing to take place securely, okay.\n\n1151\n00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,500\nSo once they agree on that, that's the\nmain mode actually getting done what it\n\n1152\n00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,950\nneeds to, the quick mode then\nis them actually saying,\n\n1153\n00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,650\nokay we're going to use triple desks, or\n\n1154\n00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,280\nwe're going to use AES to actually send\nthe data through, whatever It's gonna be.\n\n1155\n00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,214\nSo one is using to establish\nthe asymmetric key encryption,\n\n1156\n00:53:20,214 --> 00:53:22,940\nI can't remember what\ni was gonna call here.\n\n1157\n00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,710\nAnd the other one is to establish\nthe symmetric encryption, right?\n\n1158\n00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:30,120\nIt is what we have here to secure\nthe traffic as we go through, okay?\n\n1159\n00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,278\nSo, let's generate some\ninteresting traffic here, hm, so\n\n1160\n00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:40,117\nim going to ping\n>> Maybe.\n\n1161\n00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:40,858\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1162\n00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:43,850\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh.\n\n1163\n00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:47,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe you might have to ping me.\n\n1164\n00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,250\n>> All right, I'll just-\n>> Man, see?\n\n1165\n00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:49,810\nLook at that.\n\n1166\n00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,270\nIt's not working.\n\n1167\n00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,520\n>> Man, what'd you do to it?\n\n1168\n00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,040\n>> I don't know.\n>> Let me let me ping you.\n\n1169\n00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,880\nPing, oops.\n\n1170\n00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,900\n>> Let's see.\n\n1171\n00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,430\nThen we-\n>> Hm.\n\n1172\n00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,740\nMaybe I broke it.\n\n1173\n00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,400\nOh, look at that.\n\n1174\n00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:06,950\nAll right.\n\n1175\n00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:09,700\nYeah, I wonder what,\ndid you block me on the firewall Ronnie?\n\n1176\n00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:12,490\n>> How did I block you on the firewall?\n\n1177\n00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,002\nYou would have blocked me.\n\n1178\n00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:19,950\n[LAUGH] So sometimes we do have other\ndefault rules that are actually there\n\n1179\n00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,870\nbecause mine is actually\nagain a web server.\n\n1180\n00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,730\nIt probably did do some blocking.\n\n1181\n00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,130\n>> Hm.\n>> That was actually going on it.\n\n1182\n00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:27,660\nKay?\n\n1183\n00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,010\nSo now at this particular\npoint as we take a look here.\n\n1184\n00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,250\nUnder our security associations,\nnow notice there is the main mode.\n\n1185\n00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,460\nAnd you see now where it's\nactually built this up.\n\n1186\n00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,200\nAnd now you can see some of the different\nthings we were talking about with IPset.\n\n1187\n00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,950\nSo notice that it actually does\nshow the pre-shared key here for\n\n1188\n00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:47,520\nthe first authentication method,\nshows the encryption method here,\n\n1189\n00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,890\nand we're using AES with a cypher-block\nchaining here, with a 128-bit encryption.\n\n1190\n00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:57,230\nWe're using in terms of our\nhashing algorithm Sha one here.\n\n1191\n00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,760\nAnd then notice the exchange\nin terms of group two.\n\n1192\n00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,160\nOkay, if I go to the quick mode,\nyou can see this one as well.\n\n1193\n00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,090\nAnd this is where it generated\nthat interesting traffic.\n\n1194\n00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:11,960\nIt is only blocking the idea of ICMP,\nokay, for us too.\n\n1195\n00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,940\nNow, at this point we're going\nto take a look here, cuz,\n\n1196\n00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,210\nit's actually neat to be able to see\nthat this traffic is encrypted, and\n\n1197\n00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:23,915\nNate has Wireshark that he's gonna run on\nhis computer and generate some more pings.\n\n1198\n00:55:23,915 --> 00:55:25,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we can see this.\n\n1199\n00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,430\n>> All right.\n\n1200\n00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,960\nSo, we'll get up into here, and\n\n1201\n00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,280\nwe'll browse to old Wireshark,\nand we'll fire this guy up.\n\n1202\n00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,710\nAlright, and,\nwe'll just begin the capture here.\n\n1203\n00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:41,100\nAnd we'll just fire off some more pings.\n\n1204\n00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,970\nDuh, duh, dum.\n\n1205\n00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,720\nAlright, we'll quickly stop this\nguy before we get overwhelmed.\n\n1206\n00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,820\nDuh, duh, dun.\n\n1207\n00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,820\nduh, duh.\n>> All right.\n\n1208\n00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:54,040\nSo once we stop this what we should\nnormally see here is the ICMP messages.\n\n1209\n00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,750\nNow as Nate scrolls back through here,\nwe're not gonna see any ICMP messages,\n\n1210\n00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,920\nbut we do see a protocol here called ESP.\n\n1211\n00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,808\nWhich stands for\nencapsulating security payload.\n\n1212\n00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:10,607\nSo this is how we can actually see\nfrom his machine .221 going to my\n\n1213\n00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:15,075\nmachine he sent the ping And\nmy machine replied back to them, but\n\n1214\n00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:18,500\nnotice it doesn't show up\nas being a ping at all.\n\n1215\n00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,600\nIt just says hey,\nthere's some encapsulated,\n\n1216\n00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,180\nthere's some security stuff here but\nI can't see anything else.\n\n1217\n00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,118\nSo in this point, you really can't.\n\n1218\n00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,865\nNow, Nate, if you right click\non one of those with ESP.\n\n1219\n00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:33,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1220\n00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,390\n>> Normally what you would\nactually find here, right?\n\n1221\n00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:38,650\nIf you could actually look into it, is\nyou'd go down to where it says follow TCP\n\n1222\n00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,960\nstream, or UDP stream, and\nthat would actually show you\n\n1223\n00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,820\nwhat data's actually going across\nin that particular connection.\n\n1224\n00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,160\nBut notice,\nthat those are actually grayed out.\n\n1225\n00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,920\nIt's saying what?\n\n1226\n00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,824\nI can't even look into this thing.\n\n1227\n00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,970\nSo Wireshark, which is a packet-sniffing\nutility force in the protocol analyzer,\n\n1228\n00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,850\ncan't even see the traffic that's\ngoing between these two computers.\n\n1229\n00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,480\nAnd even worse than that, right?\n\n1230\n00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,060\nNate's actually running this\non one of the endpoints.\n\n1231\n00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,650\nSo even on his endpoint,\n\n1232\n00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:09,150\nhere, is he's actually seeing the traffic\ncoming through the network adaptor.\n\n1233\n00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:13,050\nSomebody from the outside trying to\npeer in, can't even tell what this is.\n\n1234\n00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,175\nIt's only the response that\ntells him what it is, is a ping.\n\n1235\n00:57:15,175 --> 00:57:16,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That he knows what's going on,\n\n1236\n00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,940\non his end.\n\n1237\n00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,710\n>> So, let let, let's say this then,\nso, if let's say,\n\n1238\n00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,100\nif you're company then blocks, Netflix.\n\n1239\n00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,164\nThen can you just click on IPSec and\nsecure that shark on the way out so\n\n1240\n00:57:28,164 --> 00:57:31,850\nthat the policy doesn't see that Netflix.\n\n1241\n00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:35,370\n>> In theory, it's possible, but more\nthan likely it's not gonna be probable.\n\n1242\n00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:38,555\nBecause they're probably gonna block\nNetflix anyway as that perimeter firewall.\n\n1243\n00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,130\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1244\n00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,980\n>> Right?\nWell I guess you can always\n\n1245\n00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,030\n>> You can try.\n\n1246\n00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,770\n>> You always use,\nI don't know, something.\n\n1247\n00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,210\n[INAUDIBLE] Whatever.\n\n1248\n00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,150\nSomething, use a smartphone.\n\n1249\n00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,120\n>> Yeah, encrypted traffic is\nvery difficult, actually for\n\n1250\n00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,770\nfirewalls to deal with.\n\n1251\n00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:54,840\nSo again,\n\n1252\n00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,920\nyou migh, it might be possible if you can\nactually open those ports up as well.\n\n1253\n00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,910\n>> Sweet, all right.\n\n1254\n00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,830\nSo, so there we go.\n\n1255\n00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:03,530\nSo now we can you know,\n\n1256\n00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:07,480\nwe can use the Windows firewall to\nblock those programs from even.\n\n1257\n00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,159\nWhat were you saying?\n\n1258\n00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:09,181\n>> No, go ahead, yeah.\n\n1259\n00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:09,785\n>> Okay.\n\n1260\n00:58:09,785 --> 00:58:12,895\n>> No, go ahead, you got it.\n\n1261\n00:58:12,895 --> 00:58:14,086\n>> I'm just kidding, that was it.\n\n1262\n00:58:14,086 --> 00:58:14,596\nI'm done.\n\n1263\n00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:16,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can go.\n\n1264\n00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:21,871\n>> All right, so now that we see where\nhe's blocked pings up, I went ahead and\n\n1265\n00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:24,800\nenabled that rule again, in terms of HTTP.\n\n1266\n00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,380\nSo let's see if we can fire\nup the web browser here.\n\n1267\n00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,070\nVerify that it actually did that.\n\n1268\n00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:29,880\nAnd let's see here.\n\n1269\n00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,160\nNow keep, now go ahead and\nopen up Wireshark as well,\n\n1270\n00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,165\nand that way we can see if we,\nyou can see this coming across.\n\n1271\n00:58:37,165 --> 00:58:38,232\nYep, I've actually enabled it.\n\n1272\n00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:42,564\nAll right so open up your browser,\nand let's see what we can get.\n\n1273\n00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:54,505\nAll right.\n\n1274\n00:58:54,505 --> 00:58:55,947\nSo that's coming on through there.\n\n1275\n00:58:55,947 --> 00:58:58,515\n>> All right I stopped it.\n\n1276\n00:58:58,515 --> 00:58:59,265\nIs that what you wanted to do?\n\n1277\n00:58:59,265 --> 00:59:00,510\n>> Yep.\n\n1278\n00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:02,854\nGo ahead and stop it here.\n\n1279\n00:59:02,854 --> 00:59:06,057\nAnd let's see if we can\nfind some HTTP traffic.\n\n1280\n00:59:08,752 --> 00:59:09,970\nThere it is.\n\n1281\n00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:12,960\nOkay, so if you actually go\nup to that filter box and\n\n1282\n00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,560\ntype in HTTP,\nthat will help us filter it out.\n\n1283\n00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:18,320\n>> All right.\n\n1284\n00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,000\n>> And hit Apply.\n\n1285\n00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,580\nAll right.\n\n1286\n00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,370\n>> All right.\n\n1287\n00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,700\nSo notice that we actually\nnow have HTTP traffic here.\n\n1288\n00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,435\nSo go ahead and\nright click on one of those.\n\n1289\n00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:31,250\nNo that's,\nno that's going out to the internet there.\n\n1290\n00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,860\nRight click on the one going to me, 222.\n\n1291\n00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,520\nYeah.\nThere you go.\n\n1292\n00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,920\nAnd now go to Follow TCP stream.\n\n1293\n00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,230\nNotice that it actually shows\nup all the information here,\n\n1294\n00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,379\n'kay, that you actually see.\n\n1295\n00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:50,620\nSo here you can see the actual\ninformation that's going across here.\n\n1296\n00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,760\nSo keep going down.\n\n1297\n00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,700\nYou can actually see the entire web page.\n\n1298\n00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,797\nAnd now notice you have unauthorized,\n\n1299\n00:59:56,797 --> 00:59:59,209\nyou have some different things\nthat are going across here.\n\n1300\n00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:00,126\nI can see the web page.\n\n1301\n01:00:00,126 --> 01:00:02,355\nLooks like just a bunch of junk to me.\n\n1302\n01:00:02,355 --> 01:00:03,434\n>> Yeah.\n\n1303\n01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:04,677\n>> I don't see any graphics.\n\n1304\n01:00:04,677 --> 01:00:05,710\n>> Nope.\n\n1305\n01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:08,068\nThey're located somewhere else.\n\n1306\n01:00:08,068 --> 01:00:12,020\nAll right, so there,\nnotice that you can actually read this.\n\n1307\n01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:16,110\nNow, this is the same connection,\nbut because Nathan only opened, or\n\n1308\n01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:20,550\nonly allowed for the,\nICMP to be encrypted here, and\n\n1309\n01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,700\nallowed for HTTP to be seen and\ncaptured right here.\n\n1310\n01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,640\nAnd so Nathan has just performed\nan eavesdropping attack on me.\n\n1311\n01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,350\n>> All right.\n\n1312\n01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:27,865\n>> There we go.\n\n1313\n01:00:27,865 --> 01:00:29,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n1314\n01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,965\nSo you can see where we can restrict\ncertain traffic, and not restrict other.\n\n1315\n01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:32,900\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n1316\n01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:33,940\nThere you go.\n\n1317\n01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,480\nNice.\n\n1318\n01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,930\n>> Yeah, we got we got you\nknow we paid today, Ronnie.\n\n1319\n01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,480\nDo you want to use your hand check and\nsee if your check went in?\n\n1320\n01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:39,990\n>> Sure, go ahead.\n\n1321\n01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,030\n>> No,\nare you going to use yours to do it?\n\n1322\n01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,300\n>> Oh, yeah.\nYeah, sure, sure.\n\n1323\n01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,710\n>> Are you gonna do it right now?\n\n1324\n01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,960\n>> Yeah, I'm gonna do it right now.\n\n1325\n01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,700\n>> All right.\n\n1326\n01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,980\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n1327\n01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,840\n>> Let me know right before you do it.\n\n1328\n01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,100\n>> Sure will.\n\n1329\n01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,850\nNever.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, good deal.\n\n1330\n01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,265\n>> Yes, so, so that's all I have.\n\n1331\n01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:57,940\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> Nathan, anything else in terms of\n\n1332\n01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:02,040\ngetting ready for\nthe 7688 exam that we can tell them?\n\n1333\n01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,480\n>> Oh, man.\nYes, a lot.\n\n1334\n01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,970\nBut as, as far as this stuff goes I think\nwe've just about exhausted the yeah,\n\n1335\n01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:12,620\nthe over overview of yeah,\nsecuring your stuff, what tools to use,\n\n1336\n01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,350\nhow to do it, and how it works.\n\n1337\n01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:14,875\n>> Okay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1338\n01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,780\n>> Remember, practice is the key here.\n\n1339\n01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:22,348\nGetting used to those interfaces is really\nimportant, especially for that 7688 exam.\n\n1340\n01:01:22,348 --> 01:01:24,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, get into the firewall here.\n\n1341\n01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:28,020\nTry and practice creating these\nconnection security rules, okay?\n\n1342\n01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,550\nTake a look at all the options\nthat you have, and\n\n1343\n01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:34,600\nrealize that if you know how to set it up\ncorrectly, it's gonna be a lot easier for\n\n1344\n01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,005\nyou to troubleshoot\nwhen things don't work.\n\n1345\n01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:37,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1346\n01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,310\nYeah, and you know what I'd say\nto to be aware of the defaults.\n\n1347\n01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:43,275\nJust be aware of what\nthe default settings are.\n\n1348\n01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:44,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Perhaps,\n\n1349\n01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:47,520\nyou know if you were asked about\nsomething, then you would know if whether\n\n1350\n01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,030\nor not you would need to you know\njust enable or enable with changes.\n\n1351\n01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:52,141\nAnd that sort of thing.\n\n1352\n01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:52,717\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n1353\n01:01:52,717 --> 01:01:55,900\nalways be aware of the default\nsettings and stuff.\n\n1354\n01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,065\n>> Yep, sounds good.\n\n1355\n01:01:58,065 --> 01:01:58,690\n>> Yep.\n\n1356\n01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,250\nAll right.\n\n1357\n01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,680\nWell anything else then?\n\n1358\n01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,515\nI guess that's it.\n\n1359\n01:02:01,515 --> 01:02:03,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right,\n\n1360\n01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,373\nwell if you ever have any questions,\nbe sure to check us out,

00:01:43,690\n>> Wow.\n>> Encrypting file system,\n\n32\n00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,282\nincluding data recovery agent.\n\n33\n00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:48,840\n>> Yeah, that's quite a bit of stuff.\n\n34\n00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,800\n>> Yeah quite a bit of,\noh at just that one point?\n\n35\n00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,570\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n36\n00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,088\n>> Oh, yeah?\n>> Why not?\n\n37\n00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:53,749\n>> Yeah, EFS?\n\n38\n00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:54,495\n>> Yeah.\n\n39\n00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:58,622\n>> Well, you encrypt the file,s then you\nhave a data recovery agent that will allow\n\n40\n00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:00,631\nyou to, or someone else to decrypt it.\n\n41\n00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:01,484\nAnd that's it.\n\n42\n00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:02,030\n>> That's right yeah.\n\n43\n00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,856\nYeah.\nAs long as you're just the user,\n\n44\n00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:06,592\nthat's exactly right,\nthat's all you have to understand.\n\n45\n00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:11,450\nIs that, hey, I can encrypt stuff and\nthen, what did you say about the data\n\n46\n00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,490\nrecovery again here,\nthat somebody else can decrypt it?\n\n47\n00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's all you have to worry about.\n\n48\n00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,520\n>> That's it.\nAnd we're done.\n\n49\n00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,880\n>> But because you are an IT professional\ngoing into support Windows 8.1,\n\n50\n00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,420\nit means you have to know more than that.\n\n51\n00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,490\nYou have to know at least\nas much as Nate knows.\n\n52\n00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,920\nAt least that much,\nif not even more than that to be able\n\n53\n00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,400\nto continue on to be the IT professional\nthat you want to be, right?\n\n54\n00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,624\n>> So if it's everything that I know,\nit would be a pretty short show, right?\n\n55\n00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:39,803\n>> Oh no, no, it's going to be huge.\n\n56\n00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:41,098\n>> Man.\n>> That's right.\n\n57\n00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:42,090\n>> Right.\n\n58\n00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,070\n>> All right, well, so EFS,\nencrypting file system,\n\n59\n00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,820\nit's a component of the NTFS file system.\n\n60\n00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,680\nSo if we have a thumb drive, or\nsome other drive, or a drive somewhere\n\n61\n00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,990\nthat's on FAT32, or that new one ReFS,\n\n62\n00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,480\nyou cannot use EFS on that,\nso only NTFS drives.\n\n63\n00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,842\n>> So let's do a little reminder here.\n\n64\n00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:07,540\nRemember that, for\n\n65\n00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,335\nus here, NTFS is the native filing system\nthat we tend to use in Windows today.\n\n66\n00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:17,240\nAnd so when we have it we can actually not\nonly again, do all the neat things that we\n\n67\n00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,160\ncan do with NTFS permissions, and\ndisk quotas, and compression here.\n\n68\n00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,970\nOne of the advantages of it is also\nthe ability to do what we call\n\n69\n00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,290\nfile encryption as well.\n\n70\n00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,810\nNow, the file encryption\nis not done dependent on\n\n71\n00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,370\nany one particular application itself.\n\n72\n00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,440\nIs on the file system itself, so\nthat means that for us here it happens\n\n73\n00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,880\nearlier and it actually makes sure that no\none particular application can come in and\n\n74\n00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,310\njust really kind of decrypt\nit very easily for us.\n\n75\n00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,700\nSo because it happens earlier and\nfaster, or\n\n76\n00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,670\nmuch farther at the beginning than\nthe process of where applications come in,\n\n77\n00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,255\nit really is a good system for\nus here, okay?\n\n78\n00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:58,875\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:04,120\nYeah so, because it does come earlier in\nthe process when accessing this document,\n\n80\n00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,790\nit's transparent to other documents.\n\n81\n00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,370\nSo if you're using Word or\nsomething else to open up\n\n82\n00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,840\na Word document that isn't encrypted,\nWord doesn't know whether or\n\n83\n00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,440\nnot it's encrypted or not,\nit just opens up that document.\n\n84\n00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,200\nAnd so it's all transparent for the user.\n\n85\n00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,413\n>> Yeah, not only for the application\nlike what Nate was mentioning, but for\n\n86\n00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:23,434\nthe users themselves.\n\n87\n00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:28,311\nWhen they use EFS here, usually if I\nactually encrypt a file, when I go and\n\n88\n00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:33,519\naccess it, I really am not gonna know\nthat it's already been encrypted here.\n\n89\n00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,610\nA lot of times I'll never actually\nknow it unless I was actually\n\n90\n00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,020\nthe one encrypting it here.\n\n91\n00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,920\nI don't actually see\nthe encryption process happening.\n\n92\n00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,570\nIt's happening relatively\ntransparently for us as well.\n\n93\n00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,740\nSo it's a huge system that we can use.\n\n94\n00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,840\nBut there's some little\nkind of quirks about it\n\n95\n00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,480\nthat we actually have to\nunderstand as well, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,860\nSo that's where this show is really\ngoing is that we do have some issues\n\n97\n00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,610\nthat we have to be able to discuss and\nunderstand as we move forward here.\n\n98\n00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,835\n>> Issues like what?\n\n99\n00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:07,210\n>> Well, a lot of issues here having\nto deal with the very fact that if you,\n\n100\n00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,480\nat least at this point, for\nus here, on an individual computer,\n\n101\n00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,240\nthat means everybody that logs in can\nactually have their own file encryption.\n\n102\n00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,118\nWhich is good, until you actually\nneed everybody's files at one time.\n\n103\n00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:23,126\nWell they can't actually see each other\nand so it's lot more difficult to manage,\n\n104\n00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:25,139\nespecially in a corporate environment.\n\n105\n00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,680\n>> Right, so\nthen what's the solution to that then?\n\n106\n00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,306\n>> Yeah.\nSolution to that is to use some\n\n107\n00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,538\ntype of data recovery agent as well, okay?\n\n108\n00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:34,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n109\n00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,170\n>> And what we actually have to do, and so\nwe're gonna actually show that as well.\n\n110\n00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,080\nBut, before we do it,\n\n111\n00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,467\nlet's go ahead and talk about some\nof the other things with EFS.\n\n112\n00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:44,705\n>> All right so like some of\nthe characteristics of EFS, or\n\n113\n00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:46,903\njust even how it works in general?\n\n114\n00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:47,600\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,525\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n116\n00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:53,502\nSo EFS right,\nhow it all works, it uses PKI.\n\n117\n00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:55,232\nWhat is that, public key infrastructure?\n\n118\n00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,410\n>> Public key infrastructure.\n\n119\n00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,922\n>> A public key and a private key\nto encrypt and decrypt these files.\n\n120\n00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:06,180\nAnd pretty slick on how it all works.\n\n121\n00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,270\nAnd should we get into the drawing\nstuff now, you think or what?\n\n122\n00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,290\n>> Well, a little bit, right?\n\n123\n00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,130\nLet's talk about the concepts and\nthen we'll draw it out and\n\n124\n00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,155\nmake sure that we understand\nwhat's going on, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:14,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n126\n00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,900\none of the things that we wanna do of\ncourse, is that we rely, everybody relies\n\n127\n00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,768\non the idea of some type of encryption\nto keep our data private, okay?\n\n128\n00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:27,280\nUsually that particular type of encryption\nis what we call the idea of symmetric\n\n129\n00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,400\nencryption or symmetric key encryption.\n\n130\n00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,090\nThat means we use the same key\nto encrypt as we use to decrypt.\n\n131\n00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,970\nWe then actually have one other issue,\nafter we actually encrypt our data.\n\n132\n00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,519\nIs the issue of how do we actually\nprotect what we actually just used here?\n\n133\n00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,128\nIn other words,\nthe key that we just used to encrypt it,\n\n134\n00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:47,248\nhow do we protect that particular\nkey from getting out in the open?\n\n135\n00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:52,188\nSo we're gonna actually do a little\ndemonstration here on the ability of what\n\n136\n00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,150\nEFS really does for us.\n\n137\n00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,650\nIt allows us on a single system\nto be able to encrypt our files\n\n138\n00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,050\nin a relatively strong encryption.\n\n139\n00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,640\nAnd it also helps us to\nprotect the encryption key.\n\n140\n00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,300\nAnd so we use both the ideas of\nsymmetric key encryption and\n\n141\n00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,630\nasymmetric key encryption to\nensure that that happens.\n\n142\n00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,080\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n143\n00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,430\nSo the symmetric key encryption,\nwhen does that come into play?\n\n144\n00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,570\n>> That comes into play when we actually\nencrypt the documents themselves,\n\n145\n00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,900\nthe data itself.\n\n146\n00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,685\n>> All right, so the symmetric key\nis used to encrypt the data itself.\n\n147\n00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:25,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then the public and\n\n148\n00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,640\nprivate key is to encrypt the key\nthat was used to encrypt the file?\n\n149\n00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,580\n>> Yep, that's it.\n\n150\n00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,760\nSo if you wanna bring up a drawing,\nwe can try and talk this out.\n\n151\n00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,310\n>> Oh, yeah?\n>> Yeah.\n\n152\n00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,428\n>> All right.\n\n153\n00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,230\n>> Let's do it.\n>> Sweet, so\n\n154\n00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,860\nyou know there's another host on here,\nMike Roderick,\n\n155\n00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,210\nand he is the master at drawing\nstuff on this white board and\n\n156\n00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,260\njust-\n>> And now he's turned that over to Nate.\n\n157\n00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,370\n>> Yeah, so I'm gonna give it a shot.\n\n158\n00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,102\nI installed the program on here.\n\n159\n00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,924\n>> Yeah, see he actually stole\nMike's white board here.\n\n160\n00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,283\n>> Yep, classic white board.\n\n161\n00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:56,339\n>> Classic white board.\n\n162\n00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:57,559\n>> All right [COUGH].\n\n163\n00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,615\n>> Let's draw some data.\n\n164\n00:07:58,615 --> 00:07:59,822\nWe can draw a file.\n\n165\n00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,146\nAll right, well look at that.\n\n166\n00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:02,099\nVery nice.\n\n167\n00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,039\nI'm going to take my time.\n\n168\n00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,160\nAll right, so there is a file,\nwith data inside of it.\n\n169\n00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,843\n>> And so\nwhen we need to protect this file,\n\n170\n00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:14,700\nthe first thing we need to do is to ensure\nthat nobody else can actually view it.\n\n171\n00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,020\nNow, when we do that we're going to do\nsome kind of symmetric encryption here.\n\n172\n00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,620\nSo, we're going to actually use some\nkind of symmetric key encryption is\n\n173\n00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,570\nwhat I should say.\n\n174\n00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,450\nSo is where we actually use\na huge encryption algorithm\n\n175\n00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,430\nin which the key to encrypt and\nthe key to decrypt is exactly the same.\n\n176\n00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,310\nSo, notice that Nate has now\ndrawn a single key and so\n\n177\n00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,550\nnow we actually now use the symmetric\nkey and encryption algorithm here.\n\n178\n00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,880\nWe add in this key to essentially\nkind of unique for us and\n\n179\n00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,420\nthat protects the data so nobody else\ncan really see what the data's going on.\n\n180\n00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,275\nSo, you can draw, yep.\n\n181\n00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,260\n>> All right.\n\n182\n00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,830\nSo, that key then encrypts the data.\n\n183\n00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,190\n>> Yeah.\n>> Within that document.\n\n184\n00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,330\n>> Yep.\n>> So, just the data?\n\n185\n00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,020\n>> Just the data itself that we have.\n\n186\n00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,490\nNow, once we have this particular key\nthere, okay, If I wanna ensure now\n\n187\n00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,060\nthat the problem that we have is that if\nsomebody were able to steal the key, okay.\n\n188\n00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,300\nWhat we have now is an issue, right?\n\n189\n00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,170\nIf they steal the key and\n\n190\n00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,880\nthey steal a copy the document, they can\nactually just read the document, okay?\n\n191\n00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,370\nSo we need a way to protect\nthat encryption key.\n\n192\n00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,450\nAnd what Nate has drawn\nnow are two sets of or\n\n193\n00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,000\ntwo pair, or key pair,\nI should say, is what we have here.\n\n194\n00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,960\nOne key is going to be used to encrypt\nwhatever we want to, and the second\n\n195\n00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,260\nkey is going to be tied in with that key\nso that we can actually decrypt that.\n\n196\n00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,820\nSo we use one to encrypt.\n\n197\n00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,520\nWe use the other one to decrypt it.\n\n198\n00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,635\nYou want to show them how that?\n\n199\n00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:38,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n200\n00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:38,740\nYep.\n\n201\n00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,700\nAll right, so\nwe have this the symmetric key, right.\n\n202\n00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,164\nAnd that symmetric key,\nda, da, dum, all right so\n\n203\n00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:51,730\nwe'll just, the file encryption key.\n\n204\n00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,580\nAll right?\nSo that file encryption key,\n\n205\n00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,860\nit is stored in the header,\non that document.\n\n206\n00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:01,450\nPut this out and grab that marker.\n\n207\n00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,380\nAll right?\n\n208\n00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,000\nSo that key is stored in the header,\nright there.\n\n209\n00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,560\n>> All right?\n\n210\n00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,370\n>> All right?\n\n211\n00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,340\nSo now we have the green key.\n\n212\n00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,500\nSo we'll call the green key,\nthat one will be our public key.\n\n213\n00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,140\nThe red key will be our private key.\n\n214\n00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,470\n>> Sure, sounds good.\n\n215\n00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,350\n>> So\nwhat we do then is we use our public key.\n\n216\n00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,500\nOh yeah, and this field up here.\n\n217\n00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,210\nLet me get the black one.\n\n218\n00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,900\nThis field up here is called\nthe the data decryption field.\n\n219\n00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,920\nSo we will use our public key.\n\n220\n00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,380\nThen to encrypt that file encryption key.\n\n221\n00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,060\n>> Yeah.\n\n222\n00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,470\nNow at this point this is\nreally important for us, right?\n\n223\n00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,880\nIf somebody steals a copy of that file,\n\n224\n00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,070\nthe file encryption key is\nnow attached to the header.\n\n225\n00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,810\nWe now need to protect that header so\nthat if they do get this, they can't get\n\n226\n00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,860\naccess to that encryption key very easily\nto then be able to decrypt the data.\n\n227\n00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,900\n>> All right.\n\n228\n00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,980\nAnd so now, what we would do then\nis just use our private key.\n\n229\n00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,520\nSo whenever we go to open this\ndocument that our private key,\n\n230\n00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,104\nso this is the red key, will then be\nused to decrypt the file decryption key.\n\n231\n00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,830\nSo we'll pull that then out of the header,\nand\n\n232\n00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,470\nthen use that key to decrypt\nthe data inside our document.\n\n233\n00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,140\nNow, we can share or add more people\nto be able to decrypt this document.\n\n234\n00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,850\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,580\nSo when we get into the demonstration,\nwe'll go through and\n\n236\n00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,900\ndemonstrate that,\non how you would encrypt a file, and\n\n237\n00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,160\nby default only you can decrypt it and\nlook at it and do stuff with it.\n\n238\n00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,020\nWell, you can add other people\ninto the access for that document.\n\n239\n00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,642\nAnd you'll be able to share it.\n\n240\n00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:47,770\n>> All right, now why in the world\nwould this be a good idea?\n\n241\n00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,240\nWell, let's talk about it this way, Nate.\n\n242\n00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,830\nWhat happens if that particular header\nnow at this point is corrupted.\n\n243\n00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,450\nOkay?\n\n244\n00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,630\n>> Wait, if what, sorry.\n\n245\n00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,040\n>> If the header gets corrupted here,\n\n246\n00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,120\nto where that actual key is no longer\naccessible now that you've encrypted it.\n\n247\n00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,620\n>> Which key?\n\n248\n00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,720\nAny of them?\n\n249\n00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n250\n00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,110\n>> Well, it's lost.\n\n251\n00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n252\n00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,070\nYou know, yeah, I mean, once the key\nis damaged then, you know, it's gone.\n\n253\n00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,586\nIt's lost.\n\n254\n00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:20,050\nYou know ESF it, you know, from,\n\n255\n00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,805\nI guess as of now,\nit's not very easily broken into.\n\n256\n00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:25,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n257\n00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,040\n>> At, you know, if you encrypt something\nwith EFS and you have those keys there,\n\n258\n00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,960\nand if those keys are gone,\nyou lose them or what not, you know, if\n\n259\n00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,313\nyour file gets damaged then essentially,\nthat file is now gone forever.\n\n260\n00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:38,962\nYou're locked out.\n\n261\n00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:43,180\n>> It's not very easy at least to be\nable to try and recover anything.\n\n262\n00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,720\nSo, what Nate was just\nmentioning is that now,\n\n263\n00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,200\nwe can also have the ability then\nto actually think about doing more\n\n264\n00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,050\nthan just this one key here, and\nattaching it to a single person.\n\n265\n00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,750\nThat's what we have right here is that\nwith encrypting file system here, what we\n\n266\n00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,400\nhave is a regular standard symmetric key\nencryption algorithm with a symmetric key,\n\n267\n00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,700\nwhich is what we need.\n\n268\n00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,050\nBut that public and\n\n269\n00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,430\nprivate key are actually tied to my user\nprofile, tied to Nate's user profile,\n\n270\n00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,670\ntied to yours when you log in to\nthe actual computer at that point, okay.\n\n271\n00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,740\nSo that means that it's unique to you and\nme.\n\n272\n00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,090\nTo that point where if\nNate were to try and\n\n273\n00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:28,260\nuse his private key to decrypt a file that\nyou encrypted here, it just wouldn't work,\n\n274\n00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,810\nbut what we can do then is actually\nadd in more and more headers.\n\n275\n00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,360\nOkay.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n276\n00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,615\n>> To actually be able to do that, and\nwe're gonna show that in a little bit.\n\n277\n00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:35,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n278\n00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,470\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah and so you know,\n\n279\n00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,555\nthat process of adding\nsomeone else's key to that.\n\n280\n00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:41,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n281\n00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,045\n>> Is that you know, it would create\nanother data decryption field and\n\n282\n00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:49,865\nit would create another file encryption\nkey, and add it to the header.\n\n283\n00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:55,375\nAnd then let's say if, if I was adding\nRonnie's certificate to my file,\n\n284\n00:13:55,375 --> 00:14:02,530\nthen Ronnie would then take his public\nkey, and encrypt that file encryption key.\n\n285\n00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:08,660\nSo then, then he would get that copy and\nability to un-encrypt or decrypt the file.\n\n286\n00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,190\nAnd the same thing works when\nadding a data recovery agent.\n\n287\n00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,570\nThe data recovery agent adds\nhis key to another header, and\n\n288\n00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,120\nthere with its own file encryption key or\nanother copy of that file encryption key.\n\n289\n00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,980\nAnd you can go and get that key out.\n\n290\n00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,550\nAnd decrypt the documents.\n\n291\n00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,690\n>> Yep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n292\n00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n293\n00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,820\nSo in terms of, of really protecting\nour data, 'kay, EFS is really\n\n294\n00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,150\ngood at actually doing it here, but like\nwe said, there are some issues with it.\n\n295\n00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,720\nThe very fact is somebody could,\n\n296\n00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,490\nif we're not careful right, be able to get\naccess to that symmetric key encryption.\n\n297\n00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,060\nWhen they do, they've already got it.\n\n298\n00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,300\nSo when we protect it, that's one thing.\n\n299\n00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,570\nBut then we also have to protect\nourselves against, again that\n\n300\n00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,220\nkey becoming corrupted, or getting lost,\nor whatever it might be here.\n\n301\n00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,100\nWell, we can't recover the data.\n\n302\n00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,520\nWhere we normally see issues like this,\nis in the workplace.\n\n303\n00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,250\nWhere you may have a possibility of\nsomeone that gets hired in the company.\n\n304\n00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,650\nThey start encrypting files inside,\nand then they leave.\n\n305\n00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,640\nWell, guess what?\n\n306\n00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,070\nThis particular encryption we are talking\nabout, EFS actually makes it possible to\n\n307\n00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,770\nthis point where even it you're actually\na network administrator you can't open it\n\n308\n00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,600\nunless you do set up the ID\nof data recovery agent, so\n\n309\n00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,950\nthat they can actually get their\naccess back into that file.\n\n310\n00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,300\nSo for us here if we don't have this\nset up, there's a problem we have.\n\n311\n00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,220\nA lot of times in big environments they're\neither going to use something else\n\n312\n00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,130\nto actually ensure that\nthey can get back in.\n\n313\n00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,390\nOr they're really just going to disable\nthis idea so they can actually say,\n\n314\n00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,605\nwe'll provide our own level of encryption.\n\n315\n00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n316\n00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,356\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah,\n\n317\n00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:45,774\nit goes past the point\nof the NTFS permissions.\n\n318\n00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:49,758\nSo let's say that on a regular document,\nthat a person,\n\n319\n00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:54,163\nan administrator doesn't have\nread access to this document.\n\n320\n00:15:54,163 --> 00:16:00,029\nWell, by default, an administrator can\nseize ownership of a of an object and\n\n321\n00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,570\ngive himself permissions to it.\n\n322\n00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,800\nWell, if it's encrypted it doesn't matter.\n\n323\n00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,970\nI mean it, it's encryption is,\nI mean that's, that's the end of the line.\n\n324\n00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,980\nSo even if you are creator owner of that\nobject or if you're an administrator and\n\n325\n00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,750\nyou're trying to seize ownership of it,\nit's not gonna do any good.\n\n326\n00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,300\nI mean, it's encrypted.\n\n327\n00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,540\nAnd unless you have the key to\npull out that file encryption key,\n\n328\n00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,310\nthere's really nothing else you can do.\n\n329\n00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,900\n>> Yeah.\n\n330\n00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,145\n>> And, Nasaad, I'll share a little story.\n\n331\n00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:29,998\n>> Okay.\n\n332\n00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:35,154\n>> [CROSSTALK] So at my house,\nI have a folder where I have all of our,\n\n333\n00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:41,650\nyou know, tax returns, filings we have,\nstudent loan applications in there,\n\n334\n00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,355\npassword lists where we type\neverything out what we have.\n\n335\n00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:51,520\nAnd gosh, like credit reports and\nall sorts, I mean just everything.\n\n336\n00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,480\nEverything that somebody could\nuse to steal someone's identity.\n\n337\n00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,230\nWe have that all on the computer.\n\n338\n00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,760\nAnd so\nI encrypted that folder with the EFS.\n\n339\n00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,030\nEncrypted it.\n\n340\n00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,900\nIf anything happens to the hard drive or\nthe computer or\n\n341\n00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,700\nto who knows what, you know,\nit's encrypted and I feel better about it.\n\n342\n00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,642\nWell I did not back up those, the key.\n\n343\n00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:18,080\nAnd, you know, I format a computer\nevery now and then and sure enough.\n\n344\n00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,970\nSo I copied all my information off,\nformated the computer,\n\n345\n00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,450\nreinstalled Windows,\ncopied all my information back.\n\n346\n00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,497\nAnd it came down to getting\nto that folder, that's it.\n\n347\n00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:28,370\nThat's it, that's out.\n\n348\n00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,520\nWell, the second time,\n\n349\n00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,840\nthe second time I exported my certificate\nwhich we'll show that here in a minute.\n\n350\n00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,190\nI exported my certificate and\nstuck it on a little micro SD card, and\n\n351\n00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,520\nI put that micro SD card in\nanother little case and I,\n\n352\n00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,000\nI set it somewhere out of the way where it\nwouldn't be damaged, it wouldnt be lost.\n\n353\n00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,920\nAnd so then, if I ever I formatted\nthe computer without forgetting to give\n\n354\n00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,680\nit my certificate, I would at\nleast have a backup or an archive.\n\n355\n00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,270\nRight?\nSo I archive that certificate,\n\n356\n00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,280\nand I can have it for later.\n\n357\n00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,455\nUnfortunately, I hid\nthat SD card from myself.\n\n358\n00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so now,\n\n359\n00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,430\nI cannot find that SD Card and it's.\n\n360\n00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,340\nWho knows where it's at?\n\n361\n00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,050\nI tried looking for it.\n\n362\n00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,139\n>> That's called protection, yeah.\n\n363\n00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:10,722\n>> [LAUGH] I know so.\n\n364\n00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,540\n>> But he brings up a good point here,\nright?\n\n365\n00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,730\nThere are other ways that we\ncan actually back up this key.\n\n366\n00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,520\nSo it doesn't actually get corrupted here.\n\n367\n00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,260\nAt the same time we also wanna make sure\nthat we offer the protection that we need\n\n368\n00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,265\nin the situation that we're in.\n\n369\n00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:27,380\nSo today in Windows 8.1,\none of the advantages in terms\n\n370\n00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,600\nof doing EFS is that you really\ndon't have to do anything.\n\n371\n00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,910\nJust like anytime before.\n\n372\n00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,490\nAll you have to do is actually\nknow how to encrypt a file.\n\n373\n00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,601\nAnd once you actually\nstart encrypting a file,\n\n374\n00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:41,000\nthat will begin to generate your\nfirst EFS Key that you need.\n\n375\n00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,980\nNow in terms of actually\nstoring that key somewhere,\n\n376\n00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,290\nwe normally don't think about it.\n\n377\n00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,710\nBut you can export that key like\nwhat Nate was talking about.\n\n378\n00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,560\nAnd a lot of times they, like Windows 8.1,\n\n379\n00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,540\nthey recommend the usage of smart\ncards to store those keys on.\n\n380\n00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,375\nSo that way if you actually do want log in\nwith a smart card as soon as you plug it\n\n381\n00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,330\nin, it's got that in there, and\nthen you're ready to go so.\n\n382\n00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,755\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There, there are different ways\n\n383\n00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:08,155\nhardware ways that we can actually\nmake sure that we back everything up.\n\n384\n00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:12,330\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, you know and\neven for recovering documents.\n\n385\n00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,690\nNo, if an administrator is\na data recovery agent that\n\n386\n00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,970\nperson can then stick that\nrecovery key on a smart card.\n\n387\n00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,970\nAnd then to recover someone's data,\nit'd be as easy as going up and scanning\n\n388\n00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,520\nyour smart card or logging in with it\ndepending on, you know, however it's used.\n\n389\n00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,200\n>> Yep.\n>> And that's it.\n\n390\n00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then you're, you're signed in, and\n\n391\n00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,050\nthen EFS will then pull the certificate\noff of that smart card, and\n\n392\n00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,736\nthen use that to decrypt the stuff.\n\n393\n00:19:36,736 --> 00:19:37,810\nPretty slick.\n\n394\n00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty slick.\n\n395\n00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,400\nSo, you know, Windows 8.1, so it fully\nsupports the certificates on smart cards.\n\n396\n00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,540\n>> Yeah so we've seen a couple of\nthe different disadvantages there.\n\n397\n00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,320\nAnother one that we can actually mention\nis especially if you're not using a smart\n\n398\n00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,530\ncard or something, right?\n\n399\n00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,480\nThat's bad enough where if you lose it and\nsomebody's able to actually get\n\n400\n00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,900\naccess to it, but usually it\nrequires at least a pin number but\n\n401\n00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,380\nwhat if you're actually only using\njust a regular password here?\n\n402\n00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,910\nWell, all somebody has to do now is,\nif they know how you log in,\n\n403\n00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,100\nthey can now enter your password in and\n\n404\n00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,418\nthey can actually decrypt everything\nthat you have on your own drive as well.\n\n405\n00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:17,570\nSo Windows 8.1 really does recommend that\nif you're going to do this, to back it up,\n\n406\n00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,380\nand actually the very first\ntime you encrypt a file,\n\n407\n00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,050\nit leaves a little notification down in\nthat notification area that says, hey,\n\n408\n00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,590\nyou haven't backed up your EFS Key yet.\n\n409\n00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,260\nDon't you want to do that now?\n\n410\n00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,470\nAnd it really sits there in that\nnotification tray until you actually say,\n\n411\n00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,180\nyes, I'm gonna back it up.\n\n412\n00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,320\nOr you just turn it off and say,\nhey, don't do that anymore, okay.\n\n413\n00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,700\nSo you do have some issues that\nyou actually have to contend with\n\n414\n00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,220\nif you choose to use EFS in that sense.\n\n415\n00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,760\nSo it's great as an addition to solid\nsecurity that you've already set up.\n\n416\n00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,920\nBut by itself, it is not gonna be\nthe biggest defender in the world for\n\n417\n00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,870\nyou, it's not a single point of\nsecurity that you should just rely\n\n418\n00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,850\non because of the other\nweaknesses that we have.\n\n419\n00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,585\n>> Mm, you know, Ronnie, yeah,\nyou bring bring up a very good point.\n\n420\n00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:11,835\nSo the security, right, of let's say,\nyou have some documents, and\n\n421\n00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,635\nyou're like man, these documents\nare really important, you know,\n\n422\n00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:16,565\nthey're really private, confidential.\n\n423\n00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:19,347\nI'm gonna encrypt these things so then\nsomebody can't get in there and get it.\n\n424\n00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:24,069\nWell, you know, whenever a user signs in,\non his or her computer, then you know,\n\n425\n00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:27,977\nthey're automatically able\nto decrypt their own stuff.\n\n426\n00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:32,440\nWell, if a person is able to\nget their user ID and then\n\n427\n00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,010\ntheir password to log into their account\nthen they can get at all those documents.\n\n428\n00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,920\nSo really the security of protecting\nthose encrypted documents really\n\n429\n00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,220\ncomes down to the security of the password\nyou use to log into your account.\n\n430\n00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:47,775\n>> Yeah.\n\n431\n00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:52,109\nAnd if it's a weak password, if you share\nit with people or if you hand it out or\n\n432\n00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:56,180\nif you write in under your keyboard or\nstick it in your pocket then someone\n\n433\n00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,280\ncan still get in there and decrypt\nall your stuff with your certificate.\n\n434\n00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,870\n>> So there are disadvantages,\nthere are advantages to using this here.\n\n435\n00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,650\nBut you've got to actually\nuse it all together, right.\n\n436\n00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,100\nSo don't think of this as being\na single layer of defense for you.\n\n437\n00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,600\nNow when we get into demonstrating this in\na few minutes here, okay, we want to make\n\n438\n00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,780\nsure that we go over the things that are\nactually going to be required on the exam,\n\n439\n00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,730\nbut you're also going to see that it can\nbe a little bit challenging at times.\n\n440\n00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,080\nWe spent a few minutes in making sure\neverything actually worked here.\n\n441\n00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,180\nBut you can see some of the issues\nthat you can run into and so\n\n442\n00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,490\nwe're gonna demonstrate all that as it\ncomes up and what we're actually gonna do.\n\n443\n00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,070\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n444\n00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,609\n>> So anything else we need\nto draw out there by chance?\n\n445\n00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,747\n>> Ryan, let me ask you this.\n\n446\n00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:42,578\n>> Okay.\n\n447\n00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:47,986\n>> So what do you think happens\nwhen I have a encrypted document,\n\n448\n00:22:47,986 --> 00:22:49,963\nI encrypt it with EFS.\n\n449\n00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:53,369\nAnd I copy it to a shared\nfolder somewhere,\n\n450\n00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:56,881\nwhat do you think happens\nto that document?\n\n451\n00:22:56,881 --> 00:23:00,684\n>> What do I think\nhappens to that document?\n\n452\n00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:04,874\n>> I don't want to lead you in\nthe direction I'm going after but\n\n453\n00:23:04,874 --> 00:23:09,570\nis it encrypted 100% from your\ndrive to the destination drive?\n\n454\n00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,580\n>> I would love to think that it is,\nbut we would be wrong.\n\n455\n00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,812\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nencryption doesn't work like that.\n\n456\n00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:20,457\nRIght, encryption works as long as the\nfile's stored, usually what we actually\n\n457\n00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:24,200\nhave then is that when you transmit\nthe actual document, right.\n\n458\n00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,130\nSo you have an encrypted file stored on\nyour hard drive It then has to decrypt it,\n\n459\n00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,190\nsend it across the wire and\n\n460\n00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,450\nthen it re-encrypts that\ndocument on the other drive.\n\n461\n00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,370\nNow this actually kinda leads to\na little bit of a conundrum as well.\n\n462\n00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,471\nThis is same true when Windows has access\ndocuments that you're talking about.\n\n463\n00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:45,655\nHas to again decrypt it so\nthat it can be used.\n\n464\n00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:50,067\nAnd then when you close out if it, has to\nactually again now encrypt it back So,\n\n465\n00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:53,866\nthere is a big performance hit when\nyou start encrypting a lot of files.\n\n466\n00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:54,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n467\n00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,127\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, so if you have a file server on\n\n468\n00:23:57,127 --> 00:24:01,038\na network, and you have a bunch\nof encrypted documents stored on\n\n469\n00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,965\nthat file server, and you access those\ndocuments over the network, well, they\n\n470\n00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:11,420\nare decrypted as they make their way from\nthat file server over to your machine.\n\n471\n00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:17,260\nAnd let's say if somebody's sitting on\nthe wire and listening to the traffic,\n\n472\n00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,410\nas that file is transmitted across\nthe wire it's all in plain text.\n\n473\n00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,940\nAnd so, I mean, that could be a bad thing.\n\n474\n00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,100\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n475\n00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,240\n>> And that's once again why EFS is not\nthe single point of security that we\n\n476\n00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,610\nshould rely on, right?\n\n477\n00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,040\nSo this is where, yes,\nyou do go into other protection mechanisms\n\n478\n00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,795\nthat will help you to encrypt data\nwhile it's in transit as well, okay?\n\n479\n00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:40,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n480\n00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,357\n>> So, there's a lot of features that\nwe've just talked about here, okay,\n\n481\n00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,620\nreally in the sense for\nan individual, right?\n\n482\n00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:54,040\nIt encrypts individual files for you and\nme, okay, using your own personal\n\n483\n00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,650\nencryption key to actually again protect\nthe file that's just been encrypted.\n\n484\n00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,410\nSo, that means as long as you\ndon't have access to my account,\n\n485\n00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,800\nyou're really not gonna gain access\nto it very easily at all, okay?\n\n486\n00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,690\nSecondly, it works transparent, right?\n\n487\n00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,430\nThe very fact is that, all I have to do\nis actually kinda right-click on a file,\n\n488\n00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,800\ngo to Properties and really just put\na check box there and that's it.\n\n489\n00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,600\nI don't have to actually pick\nany level of encryption.\n\n490\n00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,570\nI don't have to actually know\nexactly how the encryption works,\n\n491\n00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,921\nhave to do any of that, okay?\n\n492\n00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,886\nBut, all I have to do is actually\njust right-click on it, and\n\n493\n00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:27,090\ndo that, and we have it.\n\n494\n00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,570\nSo, it's very easy for\n\n495\n00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,960\nus to be able to actually work\nwith in that sense there, okay?\n\n496\n00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,141\nThe other advantage of it, again,\n\n497\n00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:38,785\nis the privacy that it really\noffers in that sense, right?\n\n498\n00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:42,595\nI guess that's pretty much the same\nthing that we just talked about here at\n\n499\n00:25:42,595 --> 00:25:44,100\nthe first point that I made.\n\n500\n00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,340\nBut I mean it's just so easy and\nencrypts incredibly well for\n\n501\n00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,950\nus, and it just make it easy for\n\n502\n00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,030\nusers that don't even really have\na lot of technical understanding.\n\n503\n00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,420\nSo, there's a lot of benefit in that.\n\n504\n00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,210\nBut remember we talked about\nsome disadvantages as well.\n\n505\n00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,890\nThe very fact is keeping\nthat encryption key\n\n506\n00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,540\nfrom corruption is an important\npart of it but it's hard, okay?\n\n507\n00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,796\nYou have to manually kinda\ndo it on your own here,\n\n508\n00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:12,340\nhave to be told at least that\nyou need to do this, okay?\n\n509\n00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,500\nCan these keys become corrupt?\n\n510\n00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,151\nYes, okay?\n\n511\n00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:19,090\nWindows 8.1 absolutely believes\nit will become corrupt.\n\n512\n00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,890\nSo, they tell you right away when\nyou encrypt your first file,\n\n513\n00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,500\nyou better go ahead and\nsave a copy of this encryption key, okay?\n\n514\n00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,780\nSo, there's other things in a corporate\nsense managing it can be easy\n\n515\n00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,370\nif you use things like Group Policy, okay,\nto actually make sure that this is done.\n\n516\n00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,426\nBut overall though on the individual\ncomputers not as easy, okay?\n\n517\n00:26:38,426 --> 00:26:39,187\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n518\n00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:39,696\n>> Yeah.\n\n519\n00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:44,250\n>> Yeah, you mentioned earlier\nin the beginning of the show, so\n\n520\n00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,215\nlet's say you have a disgruntled employee.\n\n521\n00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:46,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n522\n00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,050\nSo this employee maybe just barely\ngot fired, or he's about to be fired,\n\n523\n00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,300\nor the guy is gonna quit,\nor who knows what.\n\n524\n00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,900\nThis user could log in to the file server\nand encrypt everything on the file server,\n\n525\n00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,650\nand when he's done,\nhe could just wipe out his profile.\n\n526\n00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,680\n>> Well, those documents, it's gone.\n\n527\n00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,800\nThe key use to get out of that file\nencryption key is now gone, so\n\n528\n00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:18,030\nin a corporate environment controlling the\nuse of EFS it could be a really big deal.\n\n529\n00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,640\nSo you can keep tabs on\nwho can get the keys, and\n\n530\n00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,130\nwhen they do get the keys to make sure\nthat they come from a source where you can\n\n531\n00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,610\nI guess keep tabs on it and\nhave that data recovery agent in there.\n\n532\n00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,580\nAnd yeah, have a backup of it, not only to\nprotect the user from him or herself but\n\n533\n00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,480\nto protect the company as well from\nemployees encrypting stuff and\n\n534\n00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,470\nwiping those keys out and\njust locking away.\n\n535\n00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,400\n>> That's it, fair enough.\n\n536\n00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,010\n>> Yep, sure enough.\n\n537\n00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,310\n>> All right, well,\nit's pretty close to our break time.\n\n538\n00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,260\nLet's go ahead and do this, Nate.\n\n539\n00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,640\nLet's take our break, come back and\nwe'll get ready to do some demos of this.\n\n540\n00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,350\n>> Sweet.\n\n541\n00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,820\n>> How's that?\n>> All right, yep, sounds good.\n\n542\n00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,298\nWe'll get into some more\ndemo action after the break.\n\n543\n00:27:56,298 --> 00:28:04,656\n[SOUND].\n\n544\n00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:05,341\nAll right.\n\n545\n00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,664\nWelcome back.\n\n546\n00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:11,624\nAll right, so where we left off,\nwe're talking about the characteristics,\n\n547\n00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:17,035\nfeatures, potential pitfalls, downfalls,\nand cons of using EFS in light of all its\n\n548\n00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:22,960\ngreat and fantastic great things that it\ncan do for us in protecting our documents.\n\n549\n00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,070\nAnd so now,\nwe are moving on to demonstrating it.\n\n550\n00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,620\n>> Yep.\n>> So we're actually gonna put what we\n\n551\n00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,965\ntalk about to work, protection.\n\n552\n00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:36,822\n>> So, we wanna make sure that we know\nexactly what we're talking about and\n\n553\n00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:37,527\nhow to do it.\n\n554\n00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:40,950\nNow, this is not gonna be your\nlast time in covering EFS.\n\n555\n00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,550\nIf you've already taken a look at\nthe 687 show, we cover it there.\n\n556\n00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:48,580\nWhen you go into 410, I believe\nyou actually cover it there again.\n\n557\n00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,990\nSo, you'll see it all over the place.\n\n558\n00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,330\nSo, this is a little bit more in\ndepth than what we would've had\n\n559\n00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,330\nin terms of the introductory content,\nbut we wanna see how this works.\n\n560\n00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,705\nNow, we're gonna take this\nin kind of two parts here.\n\n561\n00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:01,680\nIt's gonna be one kind of a demo but\nin two parts.\n\n562\n00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,693\nOne, first of all,\n\n563\n00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:06,275\nof course just show you how easy it\nis to actually encrypt a file, okay?\n\n564\n00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:10,439\nAnd then we wanna show you the details\nbehind that in terms of what it does when\n\n565\n00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:11,380\nwe do it.\n\n566\n00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,575\nAnd then we wanna actually talk about\nthe idea of the data recovery agent as\n\n567\n00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:15,203\nwell, okay?\n\n568\n00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:16,329\nSo that's where we gonna go.\n\n569\n00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:19,870\n>> Yeah, it's in the 7411.\n\n570\n00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,305\n>> 411.\n\n571\n00:29:21,305 --> 00:29:22,864\n>> Yes, revisit EFS.\n\n572\n00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:24,580\n>> Yes.\n>> Not quite how it works and stuff,\n\n573\n00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,508\nlike what we do here.\n\n574\n00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:29,445\nBut yeah, how to get that data\nrecovery agent on the enterprise and\n\n575\n00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:33,172\nauto enrollment for the user, so\nthey get that certificate and\n\n576\n00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:36,078\nthey can't create there\nown other great stuff.\n\n577\n00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:37,940\nSo yeah, 7411.\n\n578\n00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,850\n>> 411, yeah, there we go, okay?\n\n579\n00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:44,590\nSo on my computer, what I have is,\n\n580\n00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,510\nI've got three separate accounts\nthat I've created here.\n\n581\n00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,900\nI have one called Ronnie.\n\n582\n00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,050\nThat's the actual account that I used\nwhen I first installed Windows 8.1 on it.\n\n583\n00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:57,120\nAnd so that is actually, a kinda like\na built-in administrator account.\n\n584\n00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,080\nThen I created two other accounts here.\n\n585\n00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,940\ni created one for Nate, okay?\n\n586\n00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,630\nAnd I also created another\naccount called Ronald here.\n\n587\n00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,550\nNow, the account called Ronald\nis just a standard user account.\n\n588\n00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,610\nSo, he's not an administrator\non the computer.\n\n589\n00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,020\nHe has no real administrative\ncredentials at all, okay?\n\n590\n00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,760\nHere's what we have.\n\n591\n00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,510\nWe're gonna login with that\nparticular account here.\n\n592\n00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,310\nAnd then we're gonna actually show\nthe data recovery agent using either well,\n\n593\n00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,700\nNate or Ronnie, okay?\n\n594\n00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,750\nHere's what we're gonna do.\n\n595\n00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,120\nSo, let me go ahead and\nlogin with Ronald's account here.\n\n596\n00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,210\nAnd yes, it is, oops, well maybe.\n\n597\n00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,260\n[LAUGH] The first thing\nthat actually protects you,\n\n598\n00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,060\nis not being able to\nremember your password.\n\n599\n00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,075\nSo, because I can't remember the password,\nthat actually helps out quite a bit.\n\n600\n00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:40,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, on this just default install of\n\n601\n00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,840\nWindows 8.1 here, I'm going to go\nahead and get into my desktop.\n\n602\n00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,230\nAnd from here, I'm just going\nto create a file in a folder\n\n603\n00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,780\non the hard drives, on Local Disk C here.\n\n604\n00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,753\nI created a folder earlier\ncalled Important Docs, okay?\n\n605\n00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:02,037\nSo just as a example of\nwhy mine encryption,\n\n606\n00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:05,743\nsomething I believe is important, and\nI wanna make sure nobody else can\n\n607\n00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:09,950\nactually put their prying eyes\ninto my particular documents here.\n\n608\n00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,200\nSo let's say that,\nthat folder was actually created, and\n\n609\n00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,290\nI created a sub folder, because I want\neverybody that uses this machine to be\n\n610\n00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,220\nable to have a place where they actually\nput their important documents here.\n\n611\n00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,070\nSo, here's a sub folder that\nI also created earlier.\n\n612\n00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,970\nAnd so, inside of my own folder,\nI'm just going to right-click, and\n\n613\n00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,930\ncome down to New, and as a example I'm\njust going to to create a document here.\n\n614\n00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,601\nAnd we'll call this one\n[CROSSTALK] Game Codes?\n\n615\n00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:36,770\nYou and your game codes.\n\n616\n00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,247\nAll right, let's see Game Codes.\n\n617\n00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:44,790\nGame Codes, okay?\n\n618\n00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,430\nDo you really need game codes\nto play things like Freecell,\n\n619\n00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,040\nand Minesweeper, Solitaire.\n\n620\n00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,085\n>> Yeah, if you want to win.\n\n621\n00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:52,778\n>> Really?\nThose games are hard.\n\n622\n00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:53,322\n>> Are they?\n\n623\n00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:54,078\nYeah?\n>> Mm-hm..\n\n624\n00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,423\n>> That's the only games I play.\n\n625\n00:31:55,423 --> 00:31:56,677\nSo there we go.\n\n626\n00:31:56,677 --> 00:32:01,539\nSo here's Here's game codes\nhere that we actually have.\n\n627\n00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:02,178\nOkay?\n\n628\n00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:05,900\nNow, when we right-click\non that file itself, and\n\n629\n00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,216\nI go to Properties,\non the actual Properties dialogue box,\n\n630\n00:32:10,216 --> 00:32:15,255\nI'm looking for this last grouping\ndown here under attributes.\n\n631\n00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:18,795\nAnd it's because it is actually\nrunning ntfs that I have this,\n\n632\n00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:21,355\nthat I can click on the advanced button.\n\n633\n00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:23,445\nAnd it is here relatively,\n\n634\n00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:27,930\nsimply like we said, just a single check\nmark that I actually need to put in there.\n\n635\n00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,860\nNow when I put this checkmark in,\nit's gonna actually generate that\n\n636\n00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,040\nfile encryption, that certificate that\nwe're gonna talk about for the public and\n\n637\n00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,910\nprivate key pair,\nis also gonna clip this document,\n\n638\n00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,700\ntake the encryption key that,\nthat we actually generated, and\n\n639\n00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,120\nthen lock it down with that particular\na public key that we were talking about.\n\n640\n00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,480\nSo I'm going to click, OK, and\nthen I'm going to click, Apply,\n\n641\n00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,310\nit's going to ask me\nwhat I want to encrypt.\n\n642\n00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,410\nI just want to encrypt the file at\nthis point, just as an example.\n\n643\n00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,850\nAnd so there it goes.\n\n644\n00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,720\nIt actually changes the actual created,\nmodified, accessed dates and\n\n645\n00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,460\neverything that we actually have here.\n\n646\n00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,960\nAnd I can visually tell that it's\nbeing encrypted because it changes,\n\n647\n00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,560\nthe actual color of the wording over here,\nokay.\n\n648\n00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,550\nSo these are things that you might\nhave actually seen before, okay.\n\n649\n00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,970\nIf I go back into Advanced\nat this bigger point,\n\n650\n00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,500\ntells me that the file contents\nare encrypted but I click on Details.\n\n651\n00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,650\nNow notice that I don't have what we'll\ncall a recovery certificate yet, but\n\n652\n00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,340\nnotice here we have this particular user,\nand\n\n653\n00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,330\nhe now has actually encrypted it\nwith his certificate here, okay?\n\n654\n00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,020\nSo there we go, okay?\n\n655\n00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,960\nNow, at this point, we have an encrypted\ndocument, that is protected.\n\n656\n00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,150\nLet's verify that.\n\n657\n00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,520\nThe easiest way to verify that,\nof course, is to log out as this user and\n\n658\n00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,550\nlog back in as someone else.\n\n659\n00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,740\n>> All right, so,\nthe first time that a file is encrypted.\n\n660\n00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,750\nSo that the very first time, then those,\n\n661\n00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,960\nthat key pyramid is automatically\ngenerated by Windows, and\n\n662\n00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,490\nit creates that pyramid and\nsticks it in your user profile.\n\n663\n00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,110\nThe next time that you go to encrypt\na document, it will use that.\n\n664\n00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,370\nSame key pair to encrypt that document.\n\n665\n00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,330\nSo it's only created\nautomatically on the first time.\n\n666\n00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,840\nAs you can see, we didn't get\nanything fancy or new or whatnot.\n\n667\n00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,740\nIt's just all in the background.\n\n668\n00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,350\n>> Yeah.\nThis was the very first time I'd\n\n669\n00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,540\never created this, right.\n\n670\n00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,960\nIn other words,\nI'd ever actually encrypted a file.\n\n671\n00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,070\nIt would normally warn me,\nyou better back this thing up, okay.\n\n672\n00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,256\nBut already created one\na little bit earlier.\n\n673\n00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:35,324\nHere so, I'm going to simply log off.\n\n674\n00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,480\nOr sign out, that's the new proper term\nis sign out here, is what I want to do.\n\n675\n00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,130\nAnd then I'm gonna log back in and\nlet's use my account, Ronnie.\n\n676\n00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:58,470\nThis is the one which, when I've installed\nWindows in this virtual environment,\n\n677\n00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,430\nit says here's the administrative\naccount you need to create.\n\n678\n00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,950\nSo if anybody has access to everything,\nit's this account.\n\n679\n00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,640\nOkay.\n\n680\n00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,910\nAnd once again I use my\nsuper secret lab password.\n\n681\n00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,050\nTo get access in.\n\n682\n00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,560\nAnd so now,\n\n683\n00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,110\nlogged in with that account that I\ncreated when I installed Windows here.\n\n684\n00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,800\nI should be able to navigate\nback into that folder.\n\n685\n00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,420\nSo I'm gonna go down and find\nthe Windows Explorer icon on the task bar.\n\n686\n00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,875\nAnd then over in local disk C,\nimportant docs is right there.\n\n687\n00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:34,820\nAnd there's the Ronald folder.\n\n688\n00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:40,550\nAnd there's the game codes file\nthat we were talking about.\n\n689\n00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:46,100\nAnd if I double click on that, notice it\nsays access to this, has been denied.\n\n690\n00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,980\nNow this is actually that administrative\naccount that was created at\n\n691\n00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,590\nthe very beginning but yet,\nnotice, that access is denied.\n\n692\n00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,820\nThat's pretty serious here.\n\n693\n00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,410\nOkay, so that means that it does\neven protect, even from just regular\n\n694\n00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,710\nadministrators, from being able to\ntake a look inside of your files.\n\n695\n00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,380\nOkay?\n\n696\n00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,650\nSo this is where is one of those\nissues at this point, right?\n\n697\n00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,760\nIf now Ronald is a disgruntled employee,\nand he say look, all of this stuff\n\n698\n00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,580\nthat I've been working on for the last\nmonths, Nathan doesn't appreciate me.\n\n699\n00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,040\nAnd he's starting to fire me here,\nwhat do I do?\n\n700\n00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,240\nI can go in, and in theory, encrypt all\nof the files in that folder here, and\n\n701\n00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,800\nit may be actual important stuff that\nactually relates to the company.\n\n702\n00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,130\nAnd when I leave, I leave.\n\n703\n00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:33,510\nOkay, and then if there isn't some\nway that I can actually recover that,\n\n704\n00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,040\nthat's where we actually have an issue.\n\n705\n00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,710\nOkay, because remember,\neven this guy can't get in,\n\n706\n00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,610\nNathan surely isn't going to be able\nto get access to them, either, yep.\n\n707\n00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,440\n>> So, yeah let them.\n\n708\n00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,640\nSo, on that, on the game code.\n\n709\n00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,870\nLet's right click on that guy.\n\n710\n00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,329\nLet's choose properties.\n\n711\n00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,840\nAnd let's click on the Security tab and\n\n712\n00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,090\nlet's take a look at\nwhat we've got in there.\n\n713\n00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,340\n>> Let me see if I can\nmove it up a little bit.\n\n714\n00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,090\n>> All right, so\nlet's click on Administrators and\n\n715\n00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,870\nlet's see what permissions they have.\n\n716\n00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,760\nYeah so full control over that document.\n\n717\n00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,430\nSo Ronnie is an administrator on there.\n\n718\n00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,980\nAnd according to that, yeah, I mean,\nyou should have full control over that.\n\n719\n00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,530\nOpen it up and do, yeah,\nshoot, whatever you want.\n\n720\n00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n721\n00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,380\n>> I guess being encrypted\nis locked out of it.\n\n722\n00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,360\n>> That's right.\n\n723\n00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,745\nRemember that there's only\none data decryption field\n\n724\n00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:28,085\non the header of that document right now,\nand it surely is not mine.\n\n725\n00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:31,735\nIt is only that user,\nwhich is Ronald's at this point, and so\n\n726\n00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:34,160\nwe've got a,\na fairly protected document here.\n\n727\n00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,735\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n728\n00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:35,685\n>> 'Kay.\n\n729\n00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:38,270\n>> So, all right, so then what,\n>> What's the next step?\n\n730\n00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,000\n>> Yeah.\n\n731\n00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,950\nSo, a couple of different things here,\nbecause I don't remember actually creating\n\n732\n00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:48,780\na document with mono, and see if I can\nbring up that little notification here.\n\n733\n00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,310\nSo, in that important documents, I'm going\nto just create another folder here, and\n\n734\n00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:53,940\nI'll call it Ronnie.\n\n735\n00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,300\nAnd I want to se what happens if I-\n>> Try to encrypt\n\n736\n00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,710\na file of mine cuz I don't\nremember if I did this.\n\n737\n00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,880\nIf I did, it won't show up.\n\n738\n00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:08,260\nSo this one we'll call company maybe try.\n\n739\n00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,532\nI love my touchpad.\n\n740\n00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:16,620\nIt's wonderful thing of the world here for\nmy company policy.\n\n741\n00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:22,050\nIf I can spell policy.\n\n742\n00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,550\n>> It looks good.\n\n743\n00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,450\n>> Right click, and I go to properties.\n\n744\n00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,350\nAnd then the advanced button.\n\n745\n00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,550\nAnd I encrypt the contents, click okay.\n\n746\n00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,790\nHit Comply and\nI'll se if I encrypt the file.\n\n747\n00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,147\nThere it is, that's what I was looking for\nis right there.\n\n748\n00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:39,707\nOops.\n\n749\n00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:42,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No there it is, okay.\n\n750\n00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,170\nI went ahead and clicked it so\nthat you could see this.\n\n751\n00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:49,300\nSo the very first time,\nthat's when it generates the EFS key for\n\n752\n00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,180\nus and notice here,\nit says essentially Windows 8.1 is saying\n\n753\n00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,060\nthat we believe that this thing\nis going to get corrupted.\n\n754\n00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,480\nIt happens all the time.\n\n755\n00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,220\nHard drives get corrupted, and\n\n756\n00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,270\nwe end up in situations like one\nNate was describing earlier here.\n\n757\n00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,010\nWhere, hey, I can't actually\nget access to these documents,\n\n758\n00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,120\ncuz I either lost where\nI actually have this.\n\n759\n00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,450\nSo now they actually have this here.\n\n760\n00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:16,120\nCreating this backup file helps you\nto avoid permanently losing access.\n\n761\n00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,630\nKinda a cool feature.\n\n762\n00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,570\nYeah.\n\n763\n00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,870\n>> Let's click on backup now.\n\n764\n00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,930\nLet the, we'll just go through\nthat little wizard quick.\n\n765\n00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,990\n>> All right.\n>> So like it now, backup later,\n\n766\n00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,575\nnever backup, then backup later.\n\n767\n00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:28,408\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It'll prompt you after a day or so,\n\n768\n00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:29,428\na couple days.\n\n769\n00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:32,510\n>> It'll prompt you until you do it,\nor until you tell it to stop doing it.\n\n770\n00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,590\nIt pretty much will happen.\n\n771\n00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,200\n>> All right, so here we go on\nthe certificate export wizard.\n\n772\n00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,270\nAll right?\nA little intro screen.\n\n773\n00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:38,990\nLet's click on next.\n\n774\n00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,310\n>> All right.\n>> Even though Don prefers that\n\n775\n00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,600\nwe read through that stuff.\n\n776\n00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,340\n>> Yep.\n\n777\n00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,320\n>> And so there we go.\n\n778\n00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,890\nSo we just get the one option that we have\nright there, the PFX A key to export.\n\n779\n00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,540\n>> Yep.\n\n780\n00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,580\nSo this is actually going to export that\nprivate key and everything for us here.\n\n781\n00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,007\nAnd then from this point it's\nasking me to secure this, okay.\n\n782\n00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:01,967\nSo it's gonna actually ask for a password.\n\n783\n00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:07,306\n>> And because this includes your private\nkey,- It wants a password to secure this.\n\n784\n00:40:07,306 --> 00:40:08,058\n>> Yup.\n>> You know,\n\n785\n00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:11,513\nif you're exporting out just your public\nkey then, I mean, it's not required,\n\n786\n00:40:11,513 --> 00:40:13,000\nbut this one, yeah it is.\n\n787\n00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,670\n>> So,\nthis way we actually protect this, so\n\n788\n00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,980\nthat even if somebody\ngot access to this file,\n\n789\n00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,240\nit would still need at least the password\nto be able to get access to this again.\n\n790\n00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,970\nClick next, and\nnow it's gonna ask me for a name.\n\n791\n00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:30,932\nLet's see if I can put it on my desktop\nhere, and we will call this one,\n\n792\n00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:35,705\nRonnie, just so that we can see it.\n\n793\n00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:40,222\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Ronnie's keys to the documents\n\n794\n00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:44,908\nthat I have [LAUGH] Ronnie's keys.\n\n795\n00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,450\nSo Mike and I were talking about so\nthat's what I do.\n\n796\n00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:58,360\nI name things very specific and\nMike looks at me and he's like, you know,\n\n797\n00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,280\nif you name it something like that then\nsomeone's gonna want to go out and get it.\n\n798\n00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,760\nIf you name it something really Yeah.\n\n799\n00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,622\n>> Yeah.\nSomething, real,\n\n800\n00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:06,170\nreal you know, would know.\n\n801\n00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,260\n>> Yeah.\n\n802\n00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,930\nSo, there it is, and notice that there's\na little tiny key on the outside here,\n\n803\n00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,200\na little certificate on the inside.\n\n804\n00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,690\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n805\n00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,290\nSo that is actually the key.\n\n806\n00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,990\nNow, Tell me you wouldn't store\nthis on your desktop, but-\n\n807\n00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,565\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n808\n00:41:19,565 --> 00:41:22,545\n>> You would wanna put\nit on a smart card or\n\n809\n00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:25,745\na thumbdrive that you wanna\nactually put away some place safe.\n\n810\n00:41:25,745 --> 00:41:26,865\n>> Right.\n>> Some place you remember.\n\n811\n00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:28,055\n>> Micro SD card.\n\n812\n00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:29,315\n>> Yup, micro SD card.\n\n813\n00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:29,955\n>> And you tuck away.\n\n814\n00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:31,650\n>> And that you tuck away and you forget.\n\n815\n00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,810\nWhere you placed it.\n\n816\n00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,680\nThat's awesome until you actually need it,\n\n817\n00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,770\nso always make sure that you\nactually do back this key up, okay?\n\n818\n00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,710\nSo, you always wanna do this, okay?\n\n819\n00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,950\nSo, that's one of the important\nfeatures that 8.1 really just says, no,\n\n820\n00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,770\nlook, don't even risk it at this point.\n\n821\n00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,240\nJust go ahead and do this, and\nthen again, storing it on your desktop,\n\n822\n00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,300\nnot the greatest.\n\n823\n00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,990\nIf I actually could access and\nput it on the thumb drive,\n\n824\n00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,955\nthat would be the way to go.\n\n825\n00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:56,180\nMm-hm.\n>> If I was really using this.\n\n826\n00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,730\nBut this is just our demo at this point.\n\n827\n00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,710\n>> Yeah, and shoot, I mean,\n\n828\n00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,570\nit only took just a few minutes just\nto click through that and there you go,\n\n829\n00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:06,940\nnow you can email it to yourself or\nstick it in one drive or something.\n\n830\n00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:09,320\nNo\n>> No?\n\n831\n00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,430\n>> No\n>> No you won't put in [INAUDIBLE]\n\n832\n00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,140\n>> No, you don't want to put it in some\n\n833\n00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,640\nplace that someone might\nbe able to access it.\n\n834\n00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,970\nYou want to put n only in places in\nwhich you would be able to access.\n\n835\n00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:23,770\nSo, storing it by sending it across\nthe internet may not be your best bet.\n\n836\n00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:24,270\nYeah.\n\n837\n00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,840\n>> Fair enough.\n\n838\n00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,600\n>> Yeah,\nyou could just put it on Facebook and-\n\n839\n00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,820\n>> Facebook has file storage?\n\n840\n00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:32,728\n>> They'll love it.\n\n841\n00:42:32,728 --> 00:42:35,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sure, why not.\n\n842\n00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,590\n>> So now we've got our certificate.\n\n843\n00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,240\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, we click through the wizard.\n\n844\n00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,630\nSo, now what?\n\n845\n00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:46,390\n>> So now that we have this EFS,\nso now we know how a works here.\n\n846\n00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:50,890\nWe've proven, not only can we encrypt\na file, but we've also showed that even\n\n847\n00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:55,620\nthe actual built in administrator for\nthis 8.1 machine, can't really get access.\n\n848\n00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,980\nOkay, once they built in, but\nthe initial administrator.\n\n849\n00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,700\nThe one that should have access to\neverything, really cannot get access in.\n\n850\n00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,410\nWell, once again that sounds great,\n\n851\n00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,520\nokay, until something\nhappens to that thicker key.\n\n852\n00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,630\nOkay, so if that were actually\nsomething that happened to that\n\n853\n00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,900\nkey then that's where we would\nactually have a problem.\n\n854\n00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:22,455\nSo, exporting it really, apparently my\nmachine just rebooted here, or turned off.\n\n855\n00:43:22,455 --> 00:43:26,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, that may not be the best,\n\n856\n00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,200\nthat was kind of unusual.\n\n857\n00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:35,650\nAll right, so at this point here right\nOnce we actually have access to it, okay,\n\n858\n00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:42,743\nwe are ready to go, but what would\nbe better, my machine will, whoa!\n\n859\n00:43:42,743 --> 00:43:45,470\nYeah, that was weird, okay.\n\n860\n00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,750\nSo, it's like someone was\ntrying to access my machine.\n\n861\n00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,668\nAre you playing around with my machine?\n\n862\n00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:49,918\n>> No.\n\n863\n00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:54,508\n>> So, what we want to do though is we\nwant to actually be able to offer the idea\n\n864\n00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:57,260\nof being able to recover the data.\n\n865\n00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,650\nIn case the key does get corrupted,\nokay, and\n\n866\n00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,720\nit actually no longer\nmatches what we have.\n\n867\n00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,068\nThis is where we can add in\nthe data recovery agent, right.\n\n868\n00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:06,885\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n869\n00:44:06,885 --> 00:44:08,090\n>> Yup.\n>> All right,\n\n870\n00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,895\ngo to data recovery agent, so.\n\n871\n00:44:09,895 --> 00:44:13,125\nYou know, in a business\ncorporate environment, you know,\n\n872\n00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:16,405\nthe set up on that would be much different\nthan what we're going to do here.\n\n873\n00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:19,655\nAnd Ronnie, if I'm not mistaken,\nsort of be using a command line.\n\n874\n00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:22,295\n>> Yeah.\n>> With a command tool utility called\n\n875\n00:44:22,295 --> 00:44:22,875\nSyfer.\n\n876\n00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:23,745\n>> Syfer.\n\n877\n00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,265\n>> A couple of key presses and\ncreate our data recovery agent.\n\n878\n00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:28,265\n>> Yes we are.\n\n879\n00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,215\n>> Sweet.\n\n880\n00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:30,055\n>> All right.\n\n881\n00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:34,590\nSo what we're going to do is,\nwe are going to Make Nate\n\n882\n00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n883\n00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,100\n>> Our data recovery agent for\nour machine here.\n\n884\n00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,360\n>> Yes.\nI'll, I'll take care of everything.\n\n885\n00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:39,900\n>> Excellent.\n\n886\n00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,380\nYes he will, 'kay?\n\n887\n00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,910\nSo let's go ahead and log in as Nate.\n\n888\n00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:49,445\nYep.\n\n889\n00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:50,967\nI tell you, I can't type that password in.\n\n890\n00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:55,165\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I\n\n891\n00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:57,975\ncan't tell you how many times I've\ntyped that password in over the past\n\n892\n00:44:57,975 --> 00:44:59,035\neight years-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n893\n00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:01,190\n>> But it's still,\nit still kind of gets me.\n\n894\n00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,430\nYeah, these are just lab machines, Ronnie.\n\n895\n00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,080\nYou could just have, if you turned\noff your complexity requirements,\n\n896\n00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,100\nit could just be a and\nthat could be your whole password.\n\n897\n00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,710\n>> Yes.\n\n898\n00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,010\n>> And you wouldn't have to\nworry about that anymore.\n\n899\n00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,810\n>> That's true.\n\n900\n00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:16,290\nThat is absolutely true, but keeping\nthe best practices, I will not do that.\n\n901\n00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:16,920\nOkay?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n902\n00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,790\n>> All right, so\n\n903\n00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,760\nnow, how do we actually make a NATE,\nthe data recovery agent?\n\n904\n00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,290\nWell, on this machine, I can go to\nthe command line here To do that.\n\n905\n00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:30,930\nNow for us, I'm gonna actually\nuse the old power shell.\n\n906\n00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:37,200\nI heard it from a good friend of mine, Jay\nBerkia, another host on our shows here.\n\n907\n00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,410\nHe says hey, anything that you\ncan do on the command line\n\n908\n00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,910\nYou can do in power shell,\nand that's probably true.\n\n909\n00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,370\nI'm still gonna use the regular\ncommand line utilities to help us.\n\n910\n00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,820\nRight, still don't know what\nthat's about but there we go.\n\n911\n00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,900\nJust want to make it\na little bit larger here.\n\n912\n00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,420\nSo notice where you actually are into,\nokay?\n\n913\n00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:00,430\nSo for me to be able to find where this\nparticular file is actually gonna create,\n\n914\n00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:05,590\nor the certificates gonna create here It\nis going to be stored where error, yeah,\n\n915\n00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,030\nso, notice it's actually inside Nathan's\nprofile or Nate's profile at this point.\n\n916\n00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:14,540\nSo there is a command that we\ncan use that we call cipher and\n\n917\n00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,000\nonce again I always recommend this.\n\n918\n00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,170\nIf you haven't actually explored this\ntool always do something like, okay,\n\n919\n00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,830\ncipher or the forward slash question\nmark and see the syntax And\n\n920\n00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,828\nsee how many different\noptions that you have, 'kay?\n\n921\n00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:25,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n922\n00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,470\n>> What we are trying to do is we\nare going to create a recovery\n\n923\n00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,010\ncertificate is essentially is\nwhat we're doing here, and\n\n924\n00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:37,230\nthen we do a colon and we do the name\nof the actual file at this point.\n\n925\n00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,106\nSo I'm just gonna call it well, Nathan.\n\n926\n00:46:39,106 --> 00:46:39,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n927\n00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,205\n>> Why?\nBecause well, I can.\n\n928\n00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:43,453\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, and Nathan's not typing so\n\n929\n00:46:43,453 --> 00:46:44,259\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n930\n00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,968\n>> I don't worry about it.\n\n931\n00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:46,540\n>> Okay.\n>> All right?\n\n932\n00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,180\nNotice that here it is, right?\n\n933\n00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,200\nIt's essentially walking through and\ndoing the same thing.\n\n934\n00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,230\nThat we just did in that GUI interface,\nright?\n\n935\n00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,860\nIt's asking me for\na password to protect this thing.\n\n936\n00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,990\n>> The letter A, no you're gonna\ntype out that long password again?\n\n937\n00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:10,210\n>> I just did, and notice,\nwe have now our dots CERNRPFX here.\n\n938\n00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:14,330\nAnd so, the other one is actually for,\nof course, using the public key and\n\n939\n00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,380\nthe other one's actually for\nour private here.\n\n940\n00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,150\nSo, both of them were essentially created.\n\n941\n00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,850\nNow, this actually creates a file, and\n\n942\n00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,520\nit's kind of a little bit tricky here,\nokay?\n\n943\n00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:28,230\nAt the beginning, I have just created what\nis called a self-signed certificate, okay?\n\n944\n00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:32,190\nSo, there is nothing that verifies\nthis certificate that we've just made.\n\n945\n00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:37,700\nSo, the computer says, when I look in my\ncertificate store, I don't really see,\n\n946\n00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,740\nwell you did, okay, but\nyou're the only one who can testify that.\n\n947\n00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,700\nSo, you're gonna actually see where it's\ngonna talk about the idea of an unknown\n\n948\n00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,150\nuser, or something like that.\n\n949\n00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,710\nWhen we do actually put it in\nplace where we need it, okay?\n\n950\n00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,320\nSo we just generated the first\npart of this to actually help us\n\n951\n00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,640\nin terms of our data recovery.\n\n952\n00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:57,490\n>> So now that we have our certificates.\n\n953\n00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:58,939\nNow I'm gonna go into where it was saved.\n\n954\n00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:01,319\nSo it will be and the Nathan profile.\n\n955\n00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:02,085\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n956\n00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:06,416\n>> And import that into our\nuser's Certificate profile.\n\n957\n00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,054\nOr into the certificate store.\n\n958\n00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:08,774\nCorrect?\n\n959\n00:48:08,774 --> 00:48:09,540\n>> Yes.\n\n960\n00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,036\n>> Nice.\n\n961\n00:48:11,036 --> 00:48:14,830\nAnd Nathan profile.\n\n962\n00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,020\n>> So, oops, I forgot.\n\n963\n00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,100\nThis is where we actually did\na little bit earlier too.\n\n964\n00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,860\nSo one way or the other one here,\nI'm gonna assume the later one here.\n\n965\n00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,020\nYep the later one.\n\n966\n00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,230\nThe time period matches here.\n\n967\n00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:32,285\nSo the one that I want for data recovery,\nis of course gonna be the private key,\n\n968\n00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:33,109\nright?\n\n969\n00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:35,640\nIsn't that right?\n\n970\n00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,140\nYep, that's right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n971\n00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n972\n00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,850\n>> Yeah, we ended up throwing both\n\n973\n00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,970\nof them in there.\n\n974\n00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:43,580\n>> Yeah, so\nwe might do the same thing just in case.\n\n975\n00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,250\nSo I know it's difficult to tell, and\nI wish I had that zoom in tool that could\n\n976\n00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,860\nreally, but being full screen here\ndidn't zoom in very well for me.\n\n977\n00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,260\nThere's a little tiny key here that tells\nyou that that's the actual key for us.\n\n978\n00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:56,819\nSo if I right-click.\n\n979\n00:48:59,046 --> 00:49:00,991\nDid this one work on this one?\n\n980\n00:49:00,991 --> 00:49:02,562\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay, I can't remember if this,\n\n981\n00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:05,570\none of these didn't work when we\ntried the little shortcut there.\n\n982\n00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,130\nSo there we go, okay.\n\n983\n00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:10,140\nSo, right here notice that it says\nWelcome to the Import Wizard, so\n\n984\n00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,738\nthis is gonna import it into that\ncertificate store is what we're gonna do.\n\n985\n00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:17,670\nSo it's gonna be to the current user,\nthe one that's logged in.\n\n986\n00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,789\nClick Next and it's gonna say the file\nthat I want to actually want to import,\n\n987\n00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:25,606\nand there it is,\nI believe that that's the correct one.\n\n988\n00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:26,106\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n989\n00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:32,575\n>> Well, if I can click on it, and\nnow it's asking me for the password.\n\n990\n00:49:37,024 --> 00:49:42,132\nAnd notice, strong private key protection,\nmark this as exportable.\n\n991\n00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:45,240\nAllow you to transport or\nback it up at a later time.\n\n992\n00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,540\nYeah, you can actually do all that.\n\n993\n00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,790\nWe're just gonna just do this here.\n\n994\n00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:53,450\nClick Next, Automatically Select?\n\n995\n00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,660\n>> Let's go in and do it ourselves.\n\n996\n00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,623\n>> All right, so let's manually place it.\n>> Let's make sure that we, yep,\n\n997\n00:49:56,623 --> 00:49:58,445\nthat we stick it in our personal store.\n\n998\n00:49:59,835 --> 00:50:03,425\n>> And so, notice that in your own\ncertificate store there's a folder here\n\n999\n00:50:03,425 --> 00:50:04,045\ncalled Personal.\n\n1000\n00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:05,995\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Click OK.\n\n1001\n00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:06,645\nClick Maybe.\n\n1002\n00:50:07,985 --> 00:50:08,835\n>> All right.\n>> That's good.\n\n1003\n00:50:08,835 --> 00:50:11,510\n>> Yep.\n>> And we'll click Next.\n\n1004\n00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:12,310\nAnd so there it is.\n\n1005\n00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,973\nIt's actually just showing us a summary\nof what we're about to do here.\n\n1006\n00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:17,335\nAnd we click Finish.\n\n1007\n00:50:19,722 --> 00:50:20,494\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1008\n00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:21,493\n>> Yep.\n>> Okay?\n\n1009\n00:50:21,493 --> 00:50:22,038\n>> Yeah.\n\n1010\n00:50:22,038 --> 00:50:22,839\n>> Sweet.\n\n1011\n00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:26,174\n>> Yeah, now, if you're like me, because\nyou've done this wrong so many times,\n\n1012\n00:50:26,174 --> 00:50:28,296\nyou want to verify that\nthat actually got in there.\n\n1013\n00:50:28,296 --> 00:50:31,912\nSo we want to make sure that\nwe can verify that it did.\n\n1014\n00:50:31,912 --> 00:50:35,620\nNow, the normal way that we do\nthis is we create we call an MMC,\n\n1015\n00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,950\na Microsoft Management Console.\n\n1016\n00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,860\nSo I went to the Start screen and\nI typed in MMC, and\n\n1017\n00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,730\nthat would generate a generic console for\nme.\n\n1018\n00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,460\nThen I can go to File.\n\n1019\n00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,180\n>> And Remove Snap-Ins.\n\n1020\n00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,460\n>> And Remove Snap-Ins.\n\n1021\n00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:49,960\nWell, maybe.\n\n1022\n00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,805\nAnd then we're looking for certificates.\n\n1023\n00:50:53,805 --> 00:50:55,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1024\n00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,059\n>> I'm gonna use our account here.\n\n1025\n00:50:58,752 --> 00:50:59,252\nClick OK.\n\n1026\n00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:04,999\n>> Click on our personal.\n\n1027\n00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:07,443\n>> And there, well maybe.\n\n1028\n00:51:07,443 --> 00:51:11,200\nOh, I forgot I had created\na short cut earlier too.\n\n1029\n00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,060\nThat's what happens when I don't look,\nokay?\n\n1030\n00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,050\nSo there it is.\n\n1031\n00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,610\nSo we've just added this one in here,\nthe one that we actually wanted.\n\n1032\n00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,380\nAnd notice the intended purpose here.\n\n1033\n00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,470\nOops.\n\n1034\n00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,510\n>> Your mouse today.\n\n1035\n00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,860\n>> Yeah, it says File Recovery.\n\n1036\n00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,120\nNow, a little bit small, but\n\n1037\n00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,830\nthat's what we actually see here,\nis that this is actually for\n\n1038\n00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:34,850\nthe idea of file recovery at this point,\nis what we can actually do, okay?\n\n1039\n00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,827\nThat's been imported in there as well.\n\n1040\n00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:39,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1041\n00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,060\nAll right.\n\n1042\n00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,810\nSo, now that we have created that\ncertificate that we can use to add\n\n1043\n00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,100\nto the data recovery agent.\n\n1044\n00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,840\nSo now the next step will be to\nlog back into the profile that we\n\n1045\n00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,850\nencrypted that document in there,\ngo into those details, and\n\n1046\n00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:58,270\nthen add that as the data recovery agent,\ncorrect?\n\n1047\n00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:01,800\n>> Yeah, now there's a possibility we can\ndo that, but normally we also put it into\n\n1048\n00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:07,530\nour local policy editor as well, okay?\n\n1049\n00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:13,010\nSo what we wanna do now is also add it\ninto what we call the local policy, right?\n\n1050\n00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,470\nSo we want to do that here.\n\n1051\n00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,790\nAnd so what I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna switch on over.\n\n1052\n00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,880\nNow Nathan, the one thing I\nshould have mentioned here, okay,\n\n1053\n00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,880\nwhich is that you want to be an\nadministrator to do this on that machine.\n\n1054\n00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,030\nYou want to be an administrator\nto be able to do this.\n\n1055\n00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,180\nIf your account is just\na regular standard user,\n\n1056\n00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,140\nit's not gonna give you\nthe ability to do this.\n\n1057\n00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,020\nSo you need to actually be\nan administrator to do this, okay?\n\n1058\n00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:42,051\nSo here on the Start screen,\nI'm just gonna type in,\n\n1059\n00:52:42,051 --> 00:52:46,442\nwell maybe, gpedit.msc here.\n\n1060\n00:52:46,442 --> 00:52:49,303\nAnd that will bring up our group policy,\nwell maybe,\n\n1061\n00:52:49,303 --> 00:52:52,364\nif I could actually type it\nin correctly that would help.\n\n1062\n00:52:52,364 --> 00:52:55,470\nOur locally policy editor\nis where we wanna go.\n\n1063\n00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,040\nAnd it is in here, and please do,\n\n1064\n00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,570\nplease explore this local policy editor\nwhen you are preparing for the exam.\n\n1065\n00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,834\nIt’s very important that you do this.\n\n1066\n00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:09,140\nRemember that we have\nthe computer configuration,\n\n1067\n00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,980\nwe have the user configuration here, and\nwhat we're gonna do at this point is go\n\n1068\n00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:18,910\ninto our Windows settings, and\ninto our security settings here.\n\n1069\n00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:21,380\nAnd then,\nbecause we're actually using a public and\n\n1070\n00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,550\nprivate key pair here,\nnotice where it says Public Key Policies.\n\n1071\n00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,360\nAnd now we actually have these\nthree options underneath,\n\n1072\n00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:33,180\nEncrypting File System, Data Protection\nhere, BitLocker Drive Encryption.\n\n1073\n00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,940\nWell, the only one we're really\nworried about at this point\n\n1074\n00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,040\nis gonna be the EFS system, okay?\n\n1075\n00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,950\nThe encrypting file system.\n\n1076\n00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,610\nAnd that's what we're actually wanting\nto be able to associate our data\n\n1077\n00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:43,165\nrecovery with.\n\n1078\n00:53:43,165 --> 00:53:44,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1079\n00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,961\n>> Right-click.\nWe wanna add a data recovery agent.\n\n1080\n00:53:48,924 --> 00:53:49,696\nWell, maybe.\n\n1081\n00:53:54,004 --> 00:53:58,735\nHere, and then it's gonna say hey,\nwhat is actually gonna happen here?\n\n1082\n00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,660\nSo it says, select the users you wanna\ndesignate as your recovery agent.\n\n1083\n00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,090\nYou may select users directly from\nthe active directory if you have them,\n\n1084\n00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:07,860\notherwise you need a .cer.\n\n1085\n00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,310\nWell remember we actually\ngenerated two of them, right?\n\n1086\n00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:14,300\nWe generated the actual pfx.\n\n1087\n00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,062\nWe now have the .cer that we also need.\n\n1088\n00:54:17,062 --> 00:54:19,430\nSo I'm gonna click on Browse Folders.\n\n1089\n00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:23,559\nAnd notice that we actually have.\n\n1090\n00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:26,110\nOh, what?\n\n1091\n00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,260\nOkay so I'll select this one.\n\n1092\n00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,460\nSo earlier it actually\nshowed up without a name.\n\n1093\n00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,010\n>> Here, scroll over all the way.\n\n1094\n00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:33,510\nJust make sure.\n\n1095\n00:54:36,585 --> 00:54:37,600\nAll right.\nOkay.\n\n1096\n00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:40,695\nYeah that's the right.\n\n1097\n00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:41,609\nYeah, that's the right one.\n\n1098\n00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:42,109\n>> All right.\n\n1099\n00:54:45,755 --> 00:54:47,432\nAll right, so now it says hey,\nwait a minute.\n\n1100\n00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:50,520\nAre you sure this is\na self-signed certificate?\n\n1101\n00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,570\nI don't have a certificate\nauthority to verify this against.\n\n1102\n00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,130\nDo you still wanna install this?\n\n1103\n00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,580\nSay Yes.\n\n1104\n00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,145\nAnd there it is.\n\n1105\n00:54:58,145 --> 00:54:59,960\nNotice it says, user unknown, okay?\n\n1106\n00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,930\nThat's cuz it can't really verify\nwhere this certificate came from,\n\n1107\n00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,180\neven though it came from itself.\n\n1108\n00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Click Next, and then click Finish.\n\n1109\n00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,800\nAnd now notice, there it is.\n\n1110\n00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:16,150\nAnd notice the intended purpose of this\none again is also the file recovery.\n\n1111\n00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1112\n00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,900\nNice.\n\n1113\n00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,080\nAll right, yep, so there we go.\n\n1114\n00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,690\nSo now we got our data\nrecovery agent all lined up.\n\n1115\n00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,345\nNow, Ronnie, so this would be\na good place to take a break,\n\n1116\n00:55:26,345 --> 00:55:30,080\ncuz we are coming up, actually yeah,\nwe hit our break time.\n\n1117\n00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,631\n>> Yup, I see that now.\n\n1118\n00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:31,410\n>> All right, sweet.\n\n1119\n00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,420\nSo we'll go and take our break, and then\nwhen we come back we'll log into our other\n\n1120\n00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,210\nstuff and we'll try to open that file with\nother things and see that it breaks and\n\n1121\n00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,394\nthat we can open, and more EFS stuff.\n\n1122\n00:55:40,394 --> 00:55:41,773\nSweet.\nAll that after the break.\n\n1123\n00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:47,557\n[SOUND]\n\n1124\n00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:51,428\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n1125\n00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:56,488\nAll right, so where we left off is\nwe just added Nathan's certificate\n\n1126\n00:55:56,488 --> 00:56:01,325\ninto the local group policy and\nadded him as a recovery agent.\n\n1127\n00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,322\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, so now what's next?\n\n1128\n00:56:03,322 --> 00:56:07,548\nSo now we need to sign in as As Ronald.\n\n1129\n00:56:07,548 --> 00:56:08,222\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1130\n00:56:08,222 --> 00:56:11,905\n>> And we'll go and check and make sure\nthat Nathan then shows up in that access\n\n1131\n00:56:11,905 --> 00:56:13,870\nlist as being a data recover agent.\n\n1132\n00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n1133\n00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:18,550\nSo don't forget some of the other basic\nskills that you'll also be learning in 688\n\n1134\n00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,000\nif you haven't already, is that when\nyou do create the group policy,\n\n1135\n00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,400\nyou may want to actually go ahead.\n\n1136\n00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,880\nAnd run something like gpupdate, right,\n\n1137\n00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,670\nthat actually enforces the policy\nthat should take place right then.\n\n1138\n00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,470\nYou may wanna actually wait here.\n\n1139\n00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:32,981\nWe'll wait at this point and see, okay?\n\n1140\n00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:37,174\nSo even though we actually created\na computer policy, let's see what happens\n\n1141\n00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:40,811\nwhen we just simply log off at this\npoint and log back in as right now.\n\n1142\n00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:46,520\nBefore I do that, I'm gonna create\na file and encrypt it, right?\n\n1143\n00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,280\nThat way we can also have\nan encryption key ready to go.\n\n1144\n00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,530\nSo on my desktop here,\nI'm just gonna right-click and go to New.\n\n1145\n00:56:54,530 --> 00:57:00,055\nAnd I'm just gonna create a document here,\ngame codes 2.\n\n1146\n00:57:00,055 --> 00:57:00,555\nNice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1147\n00:57:00,555 --> 00:57:01,832\n>> There you go.\n\n1148\n00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:05,970\nRight-click, go to Properties and\n\n1149\n00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:08,135\nAdvanced and do the encrypt.\n\n1150\n00:57:08,135 --> 00:57:09,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1151\n00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,760\n>> Click OK, and\nremember what this is doing.\n\n1152\n00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,325\nThis is now creating an encryption key for\nNathan himself, or for Nate.\n\n1153\n00:57:16,735 --> 00:57:21,155\nClick Apply, and I'm just gonna encrypt\nthat one file instead and there it is.\n\n1154\n00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:24,403\nSo the first time even with Nate's\nprofile we actually went ahead and\n\n1155\n00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:25,531\nmade that encryption.\n\n1156\n00:57:25,531 --> 00:57:31,817\nSo now we have a key that we can actually\nuse to encrypt once the encryption's done.\n\n1157\n00:57:31,817 --> 00:57:37,351\nAnd we also now have a data recovery\nagent certificate as well that we have.\n\n1158\n00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:42,235\n>> You know what, Ronnie, so you do\nhave that saved snap in the console.\n\n1159\n00:57:42,235 --> 00:57:45,229\nThere, let's open that up and\njust take a look at it.\n\n1160\n00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:45,867\n>> Sure.\n\n1161\n00:57:45,867 --> 00:57:47,317\n>> So we're signed in as Nathan.\n\n1162\n00:57:47,317 --> 00:57:51,368\nAnd so, sure enough, so in the\ncertificates we have two of them, right?\n\n1163\n00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:52,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1164\n00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:57,040\n>> The bottom one is the one that\nis used for our data recovery.\n\n1165\n00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,330\nSo our decrypting of documents.\n\n1166\n00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:01,750\nAnd the top one is the one\nthat we just created,\n\n1167\n00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,390\njust now, that would be used\nto encrypt our documents.\n\n1168\n00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,030\n>> Yep, sweet.\n\n1169\n00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,070\nSo, they are in there and\nthat's what we wanted to see.\n\n1170\n00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,330\nSo, now I should be able to log off.\n\n1171\n00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:16,260\nMaybe, sign off, sign out.\n\n1172\n00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,832\nThat always gets me.\n\n1173\n00:58:17,832 --> 00:58:20,766\nDid that just kick me out of the entire,\nokay.\n\n1174\n00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:21,749\nYou never know.\n\n1175\n00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:24,703\n[LAUGH] Just when I think, yeah that's.\n\n1176\n00:58:30,351 --> 00:58:34,030\nRight, let me do a full view here.\n\n1177\n00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,440\nAll right, that was kind of interesting.\n\n1178\n00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,570\n>> Yeah, whenever you switch\ninto an advanced session,\n\n1179\n00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:45,420\nit takes you out of that console and\nsigns you into like your remote desktop.\n\n1180\n00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,690\nWe learned all about that in four ten.\n\n1181\n00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,190\n>> Yes, you do.\n\n1182\n00:58:48,938 --> 00:58:50,368\nIn the Hyper-V section?\n\n1183\n00:58:50,368 --> 00:58:52,072\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1184\n00:58:52,072 --> 00:58:53,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n1185\n00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,475\n>> You wanna watch it?\n\n1186\n00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:55,397\n>> I probably will watch it.\n\n1187\n00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:59,354\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Local disk C, oh no, yeah, and\n\n1188\n00:58:59,354 --> 00:59:02,510\nthe important docs is where we wanna go.\n\n1189\n00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:08,910\nAnd this is actually under Ronald, and\nthe game codes here, if I right-click,\n\n1190\n00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:13,340\nand I go down to Properties, and\nI select the Advanced button.\n\n1191\n00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,760\nNotice that it's still encrypted here.\n\n1192\n00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,200\nAnd I click on Details, okay?\n\n1193\n00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,440\nNotice what got added in\nby default down here.\n\n1194\n00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,552\nAgain, it's a little bit hard for\nus to see on the screen but there it is.\n\n1195\n00:59:25,552 --> 00:59:28,689\nIt actually says Nathan down\nhere is what is does say.\n\n1196\n00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:30,134\nI wanna see if I can,\n\n1197\n00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:34,728\nlet me see if I can get the zoom in\nto work a little bit better here.\n\n1198\n00:59:34,728 --> 00:59:39,680\nOh, look at that, there we go.\n\n1199\n00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,339\n>> Nice.\n\n1200\n00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:42,740\n>> I couldn't do the full screen but\nthere you go.\n\n1201\n00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,490\nSo now you actually see where it\nsays Nathan is now our recovery\n\n1202\n00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:48,450\ncertificate here.\n\n1203\n00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,310\nSo, that's where it actually is.\n\n1204\n00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:52,990\nSo, this is actually\npretty darn cool here.\n\n1205\n00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,070\nWe didn't actually have to go in and\nmanually add them in because we went ahead\n\n1206\n00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:59,960\nand did this and associated him\nin the group policy this way.\n\n1207\n00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,320\nThis is where it's gonna be.\n\n1208\n01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:08,860\nThen, let's go ahead and do this and\nthen we'll do something else here, right?\n\n1209\n01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,221\nSo, we do see this, click OK.\n\n1210\n01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:15,297\nOkay, now I should just\nbe able to do what?\n\n1211\n01:00:15,297 --> 01:00:16,625\nGet access in.\n\n1212\n01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:19,520\nOh, look at that, she did let us in.\n\n1213\n01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,440\nHere, and so, here I'll\n\n1214\n01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,808\nsay this in theory, Nate and\n\n1215\n01:00:29,808 --> 01:00:34,281\nRonald should be able to\n\n1216\n01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:39,221\nread this Ronnie cannot.\n\n1217\n01:00:39,221 --> 01:00:41,655\n>> And\nNate won't be able to read it either.\n\n1218\n01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:42,425\n>> Hm?\n\n1219\n01:00:42,425 --> 01:00:43,575\n>> Nate won't be able to read it either.\n\n1220\n01:00:43,575 --> 01:00:44,745\n>> Yeah, not yet.\n\n1221\n01:00:44,745 --> 01:00:45,956\n>> Mm, oh, I see.\n>> You're stealing the thunder.\n\n1222\n01:00:45,956 --> 01:00:46,687\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1223\n01:00:46,687 --> 01:00:47,307\n>> You're killing us.\n\n1224\n01:00:47,307 --> 01:00:47,808\n>> Okay, no, no, no.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1225\n01:00:47,808 --> 01:00:49,075\n>> It's still undone.\n\n1226\n01:00:49,075 --> 01:00:51,120\nNo, that's fine.\nYeah, okay.\n\n1227\n01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,323\nI was just looking out for you.\n\n1228\n01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:53,773\n>> No, I Appreciate it.\n\n1229\n01:00:53,773 --> 01:00:54,846\nHe is right, okay?\n\n1230\n01:00:54,846 --> 01:00:55,817\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1231\n01:00:55,817 --> 01:01:00,442\nSo, if we actually do this, right,\nat this point, Nate is right,\n\n1232\n01:01:00,442 --> 01:01:03,150\nhe would not be able to read this.\n\n1233\n01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,040\nBecause, if you take a look\nat the top edge here.\n\n1234\n01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,480\nI'm trying to get us working again here.\n\n1235\n01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:18,257\nOkay, notice what it says\nhere on the document itself.\n\n1236\n01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,768\n>> There you go.\n\n1237\n01:01:19,768 --> 01:01:23,297\n>> Okay, users who can access this file.\n\n1238\n01:01:23,297 --> 01:01:26,190\nWell, it doesn't actually say Nate here,\nokay?\n\n1239\n01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,500\nIt doesn't say that at all.\n\n1240\n01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,860\nSo even though I did this I was trying\nto beat Nate to the punchline and\n\n1241\n01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,050\nhe beat me to the punchline.\n\n1242\n01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:33,950\nHe's right.\n\n1243\n01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:38,631\nHe would not be able to do this because\nhis name is not actually in here, okay?\n\n1244\n01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:42,906\nThe only time his name can appear\nthough is if we do find that\n\n1245\n01:01:42,906 --> 01:01:45,100\nencrypting file system key.\n\n1246\n01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,105\nIn other words the one that is\nactually designed for file encryption.\n\n1247\n01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:51,190\nIf we don't have that, in other words\nif I didn't actually go ahead and\n\n1248\n01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:54,350\ncreate a file and encrypt it,\nI would not have that in there, okay?\n\n1249\n01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,790\nSo, what can we do?\n\n1250\n01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:00,290\nWell I can click on Add, and now notice\n\n1251\n01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:04,710\nthat here are three separate certificates\nthat I have that I can actually add in.\n\n1252\n01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:09,610\nSo remember earlier I had actually created\na file for Ronnie to be able to do so?\n\n1253\n01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:14,289\nSo I'm gonna leave him out of this and\nI'm gonna select Nathan.\n\n1254\n01:02:14,289 --> 01:02:18,140\nClick OK and just add those two in there.\n\n1255\n01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,270\nAnd then click OK again.\n\n1256\n01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:25,606\nA lotta OKs to click.\n\n1257\n01:02:25,606 --> 01:02:28,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Here's what we have, all right?\n\n1258\n01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,830\nSo now we're gonna log in successively.\n\n1259\n01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,110\nI'm gonna log in as Ronnie,\nverify can access the file.\n\n1260\n01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,925\nThen we should log in as Nate and\nverify we can.\n\n1261\n01:02:35,925 --> 01:02:38,280\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n1262\n01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,331\nNow, so adding somebody onto that list.\n\n1263\n01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:46,345\nYeah, anybody that you have add in there,\nthey'll be able to go in there and\n\n1264\n01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,621\nunencrypt your stuff?\n\n1265\n01:02:47,621 --> 01:02:49,053\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1266\n01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:49,553\n>> Yeah, pretty sweet.\n\n1267\n01:03:03,231 --> 01:03:08,257\nAll right, so what's the first\nstep now that we're in here?\n\n1268\n01:03:08,257 --> 01:03:12,349\n>> All right, so\nas I logged in as myself now, Ronnie,\n\n1269\n01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:16,359\nI'm just verifying to see\nif I can access the file.\n\n1270\n01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,928\nSo, I'll go back into my hard drive and\n\n1271\n01:03:19,928 --> 01:03:25,695\nto the important docs and\ninto Ronald's folder, game codes.\n\n1272\n01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,650\n>> Sure enough.\n\n1273\n01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:28,206\n>> Notice I'm still denied.\n\n1274\n01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:28,945\n>> It was close though, it was close.\n\n1275\n01:03:28,945 --> 01:03:29,583\n>> It was very close.\n\n1276\n01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,399\n>> I mean it looked like it was\ngonna open up there for a second.\n\n1277\n01:03:31,399 --> 01:03:36,550\n>> Yeah, it sure did, but\nnotice I can't actually get access to it.\n\n1278\n01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:39,740\nSo as I click OK, I'm perfectly fine.\n\n1279\n01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,290\nNow let's put the real test here.\n\n1280\n01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:47,130\nNow that we've added Nathan in not\nonly as the data recovery agent here,\n\n1281\n01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:51,715\nokay, but\nalso as a person that can read this file.\n\n1282\n01:03:51,715 --> 01:03:53,247\n>> Let's go to View and\nclick on enhance [CROSSTALK]\n\n1283\n01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,726\n>> There we go, I forgot.\n\n1284\n01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:56,543\n>> It'll make you sign again, but\n\n1285\n01:03:56,543 --> 01:03:59,788\nthat's fine cuz we're gonna\nsign in as Nathan anyways.\n\n1286\n01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:01,530\nSo that works.\n\n1287\n01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:02,982\nAnd the password.\n\n1288\n01:04:02,982 --> 01:04:04,630\nOr I could just change the a.\n\n1289\n01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:08,631\n[LAUGH].\n\n1290\n01:04:08,631 --> 01:04:09,350\nGood job Nate.\n\n1291\n01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:09,990\nI know.\n\n1292\n01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:12,200\nI thought, hey it was going to be slick.\n\n1293\n01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,240\nNo, we're like a 30 second timer now.\n\n1294\n01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,500\nIs it a 30 second timer?\n\n1295\n01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,970\nSomething like that.\n\n1296\n01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,350\nOr it's gonna be like 10 minutes.\n\n1297\n01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:19,265\nJust wanted to do.\n\n1298\n01:04:19,265 --> 01:04:20,440\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n1299\n01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,810\nSo right now we're waiting\nuntil Ryan [LAUGH] Responds,\n\n1300\n01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:26,470\nthe weird thing is I can blame Nate for\nthis one at this point here.\n\n1301\n01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,350\nWell.\n\n1302\n01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:32,700\nIf it, you know if it would work that way\nthen it would have been much fewer clicks.\n\n1303\n01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,850\nYou know to click on that stuff.\n\n1304\n01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:37,610\nHuh, Yeah, Now Now what are you gonna do,\nI guess you could uncheck in that section\n\n1305\n01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:41,970\nand go in there and sign back in,\nbut there we go so it works.\n\n1306\n01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:45,125\nYep, keep going Nate [LAUGH].\n\n1307\n01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:49,688\nIt wasn't a compliment, its fine.\n\n1308\n01:04:49,688 --> 01:04:51,056\nAll right.\n\n1309\n01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,800\nSo, now, if we go back to that\nsame file in the Important docs.\n\n1310\n01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:02,260\nWhat do you think?\n\n1311\n01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,350\nPing codes, yeah, it's gonna work now.\n\n1312\n01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,010\nIt's gonna work.\n\n1313\n01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:04,720\nYeah.\nSure?\n\n1314\n01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,400\nSure enough.\n\n1315\n01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,070\nThere it is.\n\n1316\n01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,040\nThere we go.\n\n1317\n01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,270\nLook at that, okay.\n\n1318\n01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:12,390\nSo we are able to actually verify that\neverything's actually working, all right.\n\n1319\n01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:16,490\nSo that's good but\nwhy did I need the data recovery agent?\n\n1320\n01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:18,180\nTo unencrypt it, so let's do that.\n\n1321\n01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,790\nOkay, well let's try that out.\n\n1322\n01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:23,680\nSo let's close that out, and\nlet's right click on that file.\n\n1323\n01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:29,490\nSo let's say that Ronald's user profile or\nwhat not was wiped out.\n\n1324\n01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:34,420\nSo now that we are the data recovery agent\nlet's then go to the advanced tab, or\n\n1325\n01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:37,860\nbutton, and let's click on uncheck that.\n\n1326\n01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,230\nMaybe [LAUGH].\n\n1327\n01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:43,900\nAnd click okay, and\nokay, or apply and okay.\n\n1328\n01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,680\nSure enough, so\nnow the color changed from green to black.\n\n1329\n01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:52,770\nSo there's now an unencrypted document,\nand so now then Ronald could\n\n1330\n01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:56,963\ncreate a new EFS key and re-encrypt it.\n\n1331\n01:05:56,963 --> 01:05:58,730\nIf he wanted to or\njust leave it unencrypted,\n\n1332\n01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:01,110\nsince there's nothing really\nall that important in there.\n\n1333\n01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:01,630\nYeah, not yet.\n\n1334\n01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,550\nUntil we get some codes.\n\n1335\n01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:05,460\nYeah, now remember that this actually\nsomething that's neat, right?\n\n1336\n01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,000\nIt wasn't Ronald that\nactually unencrypted it.\n\n1337\n01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,920\nWho actually owned the file,\nthis is Nate, who has actually designed,\n\n1338\n01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:17,160\ndesignated as the data recovery agent was\nable to actually decrypt that file and\n\n1339\n01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,020\nunlock it for us.\n\n1340\n01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:21,370\nSo if for one reason or\nanother if that encryption key for\n\n1341\n01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:26,450\nRonald had again corrupted well,\nwe have the way to get back into it.\n\n1342\n01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:27,270\nAll right.\n\n1343\n01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:28,840\nThere you go.\nAll right.\n\n1344\n01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,940\nNow there is another little utility.\n\n1345\n01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,240\nOkay.\nAnd this utility,\n\n1346\n01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,640\nI haven't worked with it\na whole heck of a lot.\n\n1347\n01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,550\nBut it's used.\n\n1348\n01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:46,025\nIt's a program that we can to take our\nkeys and get them to go onto smart cars.\n\n1349\n01:06:46,025 --> 01:06:46,730\nMm-hm.\n\n1350\n01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:49,283\nAs a non elegant way of saying that.\n\n1351\n01:06:49,283 --> 01:06:49,852\n[LAUGH].\n\n1352\n01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:56,370\nBut yeah that we can take a, a file and\nessentially change out it's certificates.\n\n1353\n01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,000\nSo yeah, you know, kinda sweet.\n\n1354\n01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,060\nNow, to get that,\nyou go to R-E-K-E-Y-W-I-Z, rekeywiz.exe.\n\n1355\n01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,190\nYep.\nAnd Ronnie, it looks like,\n\n1356\n01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,270\ndid you, did you type that?\n\n1357\n01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,490\nI just typed it in.\n\n1358\n01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:11,040\nAll right, and- So rekeywiz.\n\n1359\n01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,930\nHit rekeywiz.exe and there is that\nlittle tool there and we can go in and\n\n1360\n01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:18,630\nsmash enter on that and it brings us up.\n\n1361\n01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,920\nSo there we go so and click files for\n\n1362\n01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,710\nadditional security use another to select\nor create files encryption keys and\n\n1363\n01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:30,890\ncertificates and back stuff up and\nset EFS to use on a smart card.\n\n1364\n01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:33,640\nSo if we were to implement smart cards,\nwe could use this, and\n\n1365\n01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,910\nthen to take the keys out of our personal\nstore, get them onto that smart card, and\n\n1366\n01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:39,390\nupdate previously encrypted files.\n\n1367\n01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:44,190\nSo our game codes file, if we wanted\nto just completely swap out those\n\n1368\n01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:48,560\ncertificates, then they could select\nthose and use this wizard to do it.\n\n1369\n01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,120\nYeah.\n\n1370\n01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,890\nIt's pretty impressive here in\nterms of what we need to do.\n\n1371\n01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:57,250\nIt's this third point that you really\nwanna also emphasize because Microsoft\n\n1372\n01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,370\nespecially with 8.1 is really pushing\nthis idea towards smart cards a lot.\n\n1373\n01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:06,410\nSo you actually do need to know\nhow to actually set your EFS.\n\n1374\n01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:10,320\nThe user smart card,\nthere is a way to actually do it, okay?\n\n1375\n01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,670\nBut, you know what, Ronnie,\nlet me ask you this real quick.\n\n1376\n01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:16,030\nIs there such thing as\na virtual smart card?\n\n1377\n01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,370\nThere are virtual smart cards.\n\n1378\n01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,110\nAnd do you know where it is,\nwhere it stays.\n\n1379\n01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:20,710\nWhere it stays, TPM.\n\n1380\n01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:23,240\nAlright, nevermind- Yeah,\nand- Oh, was I right?\n\n1381\n01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:23,740\nYeah, yeah.\n\n1382\n01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,360\nOh, my gosh.\n\n1383\n01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,010\nI know!\nYeah, crap.\n\n1384\n01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,290\nWhat in the world?\n\n1385\n01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:28,180\nI mean, that,\nthat makes me two for two today.\n\n1386\n01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,150\nWhat was the first one?\n\n1387\n01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:32,160\nWhatever I actually did\nright that you didn't.\n\n1388\n01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,570\nWhen was that?\n\n1389\n01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,760\nProbably- What happened?\n\n1390\n01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,490\nThe whole show.\n[LAUGH] I was not [LAUGH] No I'm joking.\n\n1391\n01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:39,200\nNo, yeah we're doing good, yeah.\n\n1392\n01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,160\nWe got two today.\n\n1393\n01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,780\nYes.\nYou tried to stump me earlier on the idea\n\n1394\n01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:47,090\nof what, of files actually when\nyou transfer them across a wire,\n\n1395\n01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:47,890\nare they encrypted?\n\n1396\n01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,670\nOh that's right, that was the first one.\n\n1397\n01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:51,360\nYeah and I was right.\n\n1398\n01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:51,990\nYeah you were right.\n\n1399\n01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,280\nYeah it happens.\n\n1400\n01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,720\nSo yep not only with\nthe physical smart cards.\n\n1401\n01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,000\nYou can also have the virtual smart cards.\n\n1402\n01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,445\nAnd with a virtual smart card,\nthen those are stored in the system's TPM.\n\n1403\n01:09:01,445 --> 01:09:02,510\nMm-hm!\n\n1404\n01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,990\nYup, there we go.\nMm-hm.\n\n1405\n01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:07,560\nSo here's that that,\nthat rekeywiz here, okay?\n\n1406\n01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,530\nSo don't forget that that's actually\ngonna be one of those concepts.\n\n1407\n01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:12,250\nIf I go out and click next and\n\n1408\n01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,650\nnotice that I can use the current\ncertificate that's on it,\n\n1409\n01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:19,459\nI can create a new one if I choose to, and\nthen I can just simply walk through this.\n\n1410\n01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,370\nAnd it's asked me who the current\ncertificate is issued to,\n\n1411\n01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:26,310\ncan I back it up now,\ndo I want to back it up later?\n\n1412\n01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:32,080\nI just going to select later because\nwe already backed up one [LAUGH]\n\n1413\n01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,234\nmaybe.\n\n1414\n01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:34,160\nOops.\n\n1415\n01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,630\nWent all the way to the end.\n\n1416\n01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,970\nI forgot one,\nwhen was there actually a password?\n\n1417\n01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:40,540\nIs what it was.\nSo\n\n1418\n01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:44,010\nI should've actually saved\nthe password there, but there we go.\n\n1419\n01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:47,185\nSo in the end here, this generates a new\nkey that then you can go back and.\n\n1420\n01:09:47,185 --> 01:09:47,980\nMm-hm.\n\n1421\n01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:48,820\nReassign.\n\n1422\n01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,060\nGood idea.\n\n1423\n01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,040\nSweet.\nYeah.\n\n1424\n01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,350\nNow notice the key here.\n\n1425\n01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:56,025\nDon't risk losing access to your\nencrypted files, back the certificate up.\n\n1426\n01:09:56,025 --> 01:10:00,325\nYou can't, you cannot overemphasize\nthis in terms of Windows.\n\n1427\n01:10:00,325 --> 01:10:02,275\nThey absolutely want you\nto back this key up.\n\n1428\n01:10:02,275 --> 01:10:07,805\nSo if you don't remember anything else\nin terms of EFS, okay, especially\n\n1429\n01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:13,455\nwhen facing the 688 exam, backing\nup the key I would say is important\n\n1430\n01:10:13,455 --> 01:10:17,550\nas you actually read through everything\nthat you do with the encryption keys.\n\n1431\n01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,620\nYeah.\n\n1432\n01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:23,790\nYeah, now one last point, I guess,\nwith EFS and keys and managing stuff and\n\n1433\n01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:30,660\nthat sort of thing, is that with Windows\n8.1, as a feature called selective wipe.\n\n1434\n01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:34,720\nAnd with that, let's say you have\na non-domained joined computer,\n\n1435\n01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:40,080\nthat some remote user works from home and\nhas some documents on there, right?\n\n1436\n01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,930\nThey are encrypted.\n\n1437\n01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:46,710\nThat PC is joined with Windows Intune\nwhich I think later in the series\n\n1438\n01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,650\nwe get into Windows Intune.\n\n1439\n01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:52,655\nBut through Windows Intune,\nyou can manage that key.\n\n1440\n01:10:52,655 --> 01:10:54,750\nMm-hm.\nSo let's say that you know,\n\n1441\n01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,660\nthe home user's sitting there\nworking away and burglar comes in,\n\n1442\n01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:00,070\nsmashes through the window,\ntakes the laptop, and, and runs out.\n\n1443\n01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:04,670\nWell, there's all those encrypted files in\nthere and if that, you know attacker or\n\n1444\n01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:08,890\nwhatnot can get into the user's\nprofile he can have his way with it.\n\n1445\n01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:13,675\nWell through Windows Intune\nyou can revoke those EFS keys.\n\n1446\n01:11:13,675 --> 01:11:14,210\nUm-hm.\nAnd\n\n1447\n01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:17,925\nthen those those files would\nThe attacker boots into that profile or\n\n1448\n01:11:17,925 --> 01:11:21,235\nwhatnot, he would not be\nable to open up those files.\n\n1449\n01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,685\nSo that key would be revoked.\n\n1450\n01:11:23,685 --> 01:11:25,055\nAccess then is denied.\n\n1451\n01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:29,895\nEven if he does successfully sign in as\nthat user, can't get in those documents.\n\n1452\n01:11:29,895 --> 01:11:30,825\nYeah.\n\n1453\n01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:36,325\nYeah, just remember as well,\nEFS is not your only line of defense here.\n\n1454\n01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:40,640\nIt needs to be used in conjunction\nwith stronger ideas of security for\n\n1455\n01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,110\nyour network and for your devices.\n\n1456\n01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:48,180\nSo if you actually just say, hey, this is\nthe only thing I need to run, it's not.\n\n1457\n01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,860\nIt's not enough here, right?\n\n1458\n01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,160\nSo we already saw where we,\nwe had some of those advantages.\n\n1459\n01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,550\nJust make sure, yeah, she realizes part\nof the overall security scheme and\n\n1460\n01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:57,655\nnot security unto itself.\n\n1461\n01:11:57,655 --> 01:11:58,990\nMm-hm.\n\n1462\n01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:00,240\nYep.\nSo, yeah, EFS right?\n\n1463\n01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:04,592\nI mean, works for encrypting just files\nand folders, and, you know, and Ronnie,\n\n1464\n01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:07,050\nand coming up, you know,\nwe do have- Bitlocker.\n\n1465\n01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:10,400\nBitlocker, which bitlocker would be\nused to encrypt the entire drive.\n\n1466\n01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,950\nDrive, there you go.\n\n1467\n01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:12,540\nYeah, pretty sweet.\n\n1468\n01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,360\nSo, Ronnie let me ask you this.\n\n1469\n01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:18,000\nSo if you have a drive that\nis bitlocker encrypted,\n\n1470\n01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,048\nwould you also use EFS for\nprotecting the documents?\n\n1471\n01:12:21,048 --> 01:12:22,760\nOn a bitlocker encrypted drive.\n\n1472\n01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:23,680\nYes, I would.\n\n1473\n01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,220\nOh, yeah?\n\n1474\n01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:24,910\nYou would?\nNo.\n\n1475\n01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,165\nYeah, I would.\n\n1476\n01:12:26,165 --> 01:12:29,580\n[LAUGH] That little layer of defense and\ndebts?\n\n1477\n01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,250\nThat's right.\n\n1478\n01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,400\nLayer of defense.\n\n1479\n01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,750\nThat would be the key.\n\n1480\n01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:34,690\nNice.\n\n1481\n01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:37,760\nAlright, Ronnie, well,\nthat is all that I have for EFS.\n\n1482\n01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,145\nDo you have anything else?\n\n1483\n01:12:39,145 --> 01:12:40,260\nFor EFS to throw in.\n\n1484\n01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,320\nNope, I do not and\nI think that we've covered it fairly well.\n\n1485\n01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:49,580\nYeah EFS, you know encryption you know\nbuilt in with TFS great tool, you know.\n\n1486\n01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,000\nI use it.\nRonnie do you use it?\n\n1487\n01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,510\nHuh I do.\n\n1488\n01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:55,580\nSweet, yeah, use it, it's out there,\njust make sure you back up those keys and\n\n1489\n01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:00,860\nif you ever have any questions during\nthe show be sure to check us out,\n\n1490\n01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:02,270\nwe have a chat monitor lined up.\n\n1491\n01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:03,500\nDrop a chat in

01:13:08,370\nYep.\nIf you have any questions\n\n1495\n01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:12,805\nafter the show be sure to go into the Q\nand A at the top of every webpage.\n\n1496\n01:13:12,805 -->

00:00:15,000\nI am Nathan Copeland,\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,910\n>> How you doing?\n\n5\n00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,210\n>> Pretty good, Ronnie, how are you today?\n\n6\n00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,250\n>> Doing good.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n7\n00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,740\n>> Ready to get started here on our on,\non our\n\n8\n00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,015\nworkplace I'm gonna say it wrong again,\nworkplace joins and homegroups today.\n\n9\n00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:26,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n10\n00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,370\n>> Yep.\n\n11\n00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,047\n>> Yep.\nSo so today we've got 7688 Windows 8.1,\n\n12\n00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:37,746\nand then specifically what we will be\ncovering in our overview objective list,\n\n13\n00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,230\nyou scroll on down.\n\n14\n00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:39,960\n[LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,520\nWe've got a.\n\n16\n00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,370\n>> Oh, there they are, yep.\n\n17\n00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,900\n>> Way down there.\n\n18\n00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,440\nHere we've got Homegroup and Workplace\nJoin that we'll be covering today and\n\n19\n00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,990\nidentifying potential issues that you\n\n20\n00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,659\nknow that can happen when we try to roll\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n21\n00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> some of these things out, and\n\n22\n00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,200\nand also just when one would use\none solution over the other.\n\n23\n00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,900\n>> Right, yeah there's a lot of times\nespecially when you are in a support\n\n24\n00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,420\nenvironment and what happens is that yes,\nshe needed one particular type of\n\n25\n00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,460\nsolution, but you're not exactly\nsure which to actually choose.\n\n26\n00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,220\nSo we're gonna go over just a couple\nof different scenarios in which we will\n\n27\n00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,090\nactually use either the homegroup or\nthe workplace joiner,\n\n28\n00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,140\nas I called it earlier for\nthe show, homeplace join.\n\n29\n00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,310\nWhich Nate said,\nyeah there's no such thing.\n\n30\n00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,710\nSo, so you'll never use that one.\n\n31\n00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,040\nHere's what will happen here.\n\n32\n00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,815\nSo let's talk about this idea of,\nof, homegroups for a moment, Nate.\n\n33\n00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:30,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n34\n00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,030\n>> Okay.\n\n35\n00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,360\nNow in terms of the home group,\nwell, I, I have no clue.\n\n36\n00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,760\nNate, when, when in the world should I,\nshould I use homegroups?\n\n37\n00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,440\n>> All right.\nSo homegroups it, it's a really easy way\n\n38\n00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,570\nto to, to share files, folders,\nprinters, when you're more or\n\n39\n00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,185\nless, actually yeah, when you're on a\nhomegroup and a more group setting right?\n\n40\n00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:55,103\n>> [LAUGH] So it's not part of a domain\nsee now you're giving me a ton.\n\n41\n00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:55,868\n>> Domain.\n>> So now you're giving me a hard time\n\n42\n00:01:55,868 --> 00:02:00,590\nwith that.\nAnd so yeah, so it so yeah, home users or\n\n43\n00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,610\nvery small work environments that you\nknow, are not members of a domain yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,135\nYeah, homegroups, yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n45\n00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:07,705\n>> Pretty easy,\n\n46\n00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:10,170\nit easy to share those files folders and\nprinters.\n\n47\n00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,220\n>> All right, so Nate if I, all I have to\ndo then in terms of homegroup, right, is I\n\n48\n00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,950\njust need to make sure that everybody on\nthat network here has the same IP address.\n\n49\n00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,850\nAnd so if I'm actually telling\nsomebody that need to do this\n\n50\n00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,660\nI need to make sure that they're\nassigned to the same IP network.\n\n51\n00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,510\nAnd that they know how to do that.\n\n52\n00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,120\nAnd that they share out files and\nfolders and do all that right.\n\n53\n00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,430\n>> Yeah, yeah more less.\n\n54\n00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,500\nThe all right so you know in our,\nour network our firewall or\n\n55\n00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,865\nour network locations right?\n\n56\n00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's got to be set to the private,\n\n57\n00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,756\nthe private setting able to use\nhomegroups, it's set on public, you\n\n58\n00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:48,948\ncan't use it, if it's set on the work or\non the domain profile, you can't use it.\n\n59\n00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:50,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you have to be on that private\n\n60\n00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,670\nnetwork location.\n\n61\n00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,890\nAnd yeah, and everybody on the,\non the same network.\n\n62\n00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,070\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now, there can only be one homegroup\n\n63\n00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,520\nper per network, so\nsomebody else has already created one,\n\n64\n00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,780\nyou'll have to either join that one or\nhave that person leave the homegroup or\n\n65\n00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,050\nju, you know,\nessentially tear that homegroup down.\n\n66\n00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,690\nAnd then then build up a new one.\n\n67\n00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,040\n>> Yeah the real advantage of\nthe homegroup for use though, okay,\n\n68\n00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,825\nis the very fact that we really don't have\nto tell everybody exactly how to do it.\n\n69\n00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:17,750\nOkay?\n\n70\n00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,210\nAll we have to do is tell them hey,\nI'm gonna create a homegroup.\n\n71\n00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,410\nAnd all you have to do is join it.\n\n72\n00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,010\nRight?\n\n73\n00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,650\nWe really don't have to make sure that\nthey're assigned everything, right?\n\n74\n00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,560\nIf they're actually gonna be on the same\nnetwork, their ability to actually\n\n75\n00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,720\nsee each other using homegroups is gonna\nbe right there and available for them.\n\n76\n00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880\nI don't have to teach\nthem how to network or\n\n77\n00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,590\neven how to actually share\nout file shares or anything.\n\n78\n00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,840\nUsing the homegroup here,\nit's gonna actually do that for us.\n\n79\n00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,575\nAnd then we'll see how easy\nit is to join a homegroup.\n\n80\n00:03:42,575 --> 00:03:43,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n81\n00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,405\n>> So let's go ahead an create one,\nand then we'll see how to join one.\n\n82\n00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:45,905\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n83\n00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:46,620\n>> All right, yeah, sure.\n\n84\n00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,760\nAll right.\n\n85\n00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,710\nLet me pull up this this machine, here.\n\n86\n00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,500\nAll right?\n\n87\n00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,730\nSo on this machine right here, what,\nwhat we'll do, is open good old Explorer,\n\n88\n00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,030\nand right here on the left-hand side,\nthere is homegroup.\n\n89\n00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,330\nClick on that, and there we go,\ncreate a homegroup.\n\n90\n00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,020\nSo we will click and next through this\nlittle wizard, and now here this option,\n\n91\n00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,960\nof course, all these settings\nwe can change after the fact.\n\n92\n00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,560\nBut the, but\n\n93\n00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,710\nhere we can choose what it is we're gonna\nbe sharing off the bat with our homegroup.\n\n94\n00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,670\nPictures, videos, music, not not the\ndocuments, but printers and devices, sure.\n\n95\n00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,380\nThat sounds fine.\n\n96\n00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,579\nWe'll click on Next.\n\n97\n00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,630\nAll right.\n\n98\n00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,600\nSo now Windows will automatically\ngenerate this password.\n\n99\n00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,670\nNot the easiest to remember, and so we'll\nwe can change that guy after the fact.\n\n100\n00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,600\nSo just click on finish, and\nthere we go, just like that.\n\n101\n00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,460\nNow, for Ronnie to join,\nhe is going to need that password.\n\n102\n00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,525\nNow, I didn't write it down.\n\n103\n00:04:44,525 --> 00:04:47,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we'll do is we can click over\n\n104\n00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,970\non the homegroup name, right-click,\ngo to Change HomeGroup settings.\n\n105\n00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,060\nAnd in this menu here,\nright there, change the password.\n\n106\n00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,640\n>> There ya go.\n\n107\n00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,217\n>> So, we'll click on that and\n\n108\n00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:04,181\nwe'll change the password to\nsomething much easier like, password.\n\n109\n00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,355\n>> All right.\n\n110\n00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,040\n>> Next.\n\n111\n00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:11,280\nAnd it should change that right there for\nus.\n\n112\n00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,860\nAll right.\n\n113\n00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,130\nThere ya go.\nThat is a new password for our homegroup.\n\n114\n00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,940\n>> All right.\n\n115\n00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,890\nNow the nice thing about\ncreating this homegroup,\n\n116\n00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,870\nright if na, Nate went ahead and\nchose the ability to share out\n\n117\n00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,810\nall the stuff that he actually chose to\nshare out, it automatically will do it for\n\n118\n00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,040\nus for anybody that joins\nthis particular homegroup.\n\n119\n00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,340\nNow you may be wondering like okay, so\n\n120\n00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,880\nnow that a homegroup's created\nthen how do I actually join one?\n\n121\n00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,600\nWell it's pretty much the same way.\n\n122\n00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,560\nSo on my machine I'm ready to\nactually join this homegroup here.\n\n123\n00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,230\nOkay.\n\n124\n00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,080\nSo, what I've done is I've increased\nthe font size a little bit here.\n\n125\n00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,930\nI would go to the same place\ninto the Windows Explorer.\n\n126\n00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,600\nAnd then in the WIndows Explorer here,\nyou might be noticing my\n\n127\n00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,800\nmagnifying glass icon here so\nthat we can see a little bit better.\n\n128\n00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,570\nOkay.\n\n129\n00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,700\nI'm going to go ahead and\nclick on homegroup.\n\n130\n00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,060\nAnd now, notice that this one does\nnot give me the option right now\n\n131\n00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,440\nto create a homegroup.\n\n132\n00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,200\nIt only gives me the option\nto join the homegroup.\n\n133\n00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,500\nNow, before Nate had\nactually created this, okay,\n\n134\n00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,960\nit actually gave me\nthe option to create one.\n\n135\n00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,670\nSo if I would have beat Nate\nin terms of creating it,\n\n136\n00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,270\nhe would have only had\nthe option to join a homegroup.\n\n137\n00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,510\nIt probably would have told him if he\nwas in the middle of creating one that,\n\n138\n00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,680\nhey, you really can only join one\nbecause another one actually exists\n\n139\n00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,650\non the same network that you're on.\n\n140\n00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,430\nSo here it is.\n\n141\n00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,670\nAnd notice it says,\nwith the homegroup then I can browse,\n\n142\n00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,760\nsearch shared files on other PCs and\nshared printers and other devices as well.\n\n143\n00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,128\nAnd it's actually protected by a password.\n\n144\n00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,805\nSo, what Nate would do is actually\nallow anybody that wanted to join this\n\n145\n00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:39,130\nhomegroup, go ahead and select join now.\n\n146\n00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,620\nAnd then, at this point,\nwe would simply follow the menu.\n\n147\n00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,580\nAnd I click next here.\n\n148\n00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,400\nAnd notice what we actually have here.\n\n149\n00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,380\nEverything is pretty much shared except\nfor his documents for right now and\n\n150\n00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,920\nI don't have to share mine either.\n\n151\n00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,060\nSo if I wanted to share everything else,\n\n152\n00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,420\nthese are the most commonly shared\nlocations on most computers\n\n153\n00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,670\nhere that we have that we want to be\nable to allow other people to see.\n\n154\n00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,728\nAnd then I click Next and then password,\n\n155\n00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:09,350\nif I've typed it in correctly,\nthat is the key.\n\n156\n00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,100\nAnd from there, I'll click Next again.\n\n157\n00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,465\nAnd we'll see right here in a moment\nwhether or not I've joined the homegroup.\n\n158\n00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,280\nNow I can see over on left hand side,\nNathan's name popped right up there.\n\n159\n00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,310\nAnd now my name has actually popped up.\n\n160\n00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,510\nSays now you can begin accessing files and\n\n161\n00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,690\nprinters shared by other\npeople in this homegroup.\n\n162\n00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,780\nSo now both of us are now in\nthis particular home group.\n\n163\n00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,270\nAnd now those locations that we just\ntalked about are now available for\n\n164\n00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,638\nus to share.\n\n165\n00:07:36,638 --> 00:07:40,151\nAnd notice, Nate didn't have to\nreconfigure a file share for me,\n\n166\n00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:43,994\nhe didn't have to go through and\nshare out his particular printer.\n\n167\n00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:46,374\nIt automatically shared it out for\nus, and so\n\n168\n00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:50,333\nno longer do we really have to worry\nabout somebody that's not as skilled.\n\n169\n00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,799\nAnd being able to do things like that.\n\n170\n00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:54,780\nBy putting it here,\nit makes it very simple for us.\n\n171\n00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n172\n00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,992\n>> Yeah.\n\n173\n00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:59,470\n>> All right, so, you know, so\non there, it just gave us those,\n\n174\n00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,480\nthose options right away\nof those items to share.\n\n175\n00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,710\nSo videos, the music, the pictures.\n\n176\n00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,496\nLet's say that there's\nsome other type of file or\n\n177\n00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:11,085\na folder somewhere else that you want\nto share it with that home group.\n\n178\n00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:11,712\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n179\n00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:13,610\n>> So it's pretty simple.\n\n180\n00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,800\nSo, let me close that down.\n\n181\n00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,940\nAll right, so there is a folder, a couple\nfolders, actually, on the C drive.\n\n182\n00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,001\nAs we've got game codes and game guides.\n\n183\n00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,501\nAll right, so these are things\ndefinitely to share and collaborate on.\n\n184\n00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:27,294\n>> Right.\n\n185\n00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:31,458\n>> So what I can do on these game codes,\nand we can just right-click, and\n\n186\n00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,320\nShare with,\nwe'll share with the homegroup.\n\n187\n00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,043\nNow we have two options,\nview and view and edit.\n\n188\n00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:41,734\nView just assigns read permissions and\nthe view and edit is view and\n\n189\n00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,254\nwrite permissions.\n\n190\n00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:44,001\n>> Okay?\n\n191\n00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,653\n>> All right so,\nlet's see Game Codes, sure, you know,\n\n192\n00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:48,850\nI'll just give Ronnie a view and\nedit on that one.\n\n193\n00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,030\nOn the Game Guides, well, you know,\n\n194\n00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,570\nwe'll just do Share with,\nI'll just do read only on that one.\n\n195\n00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,120\nAll right.\n\n196\n00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,140\nAnd that's really it.\n\n197\n00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,600\nNow let's check it out\non Ronnie's machine.\n\n198\n00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,780\n>> All right, so over on,\non my machine here,\n\n199\n00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,890\nif I wanted to get access\nto them let's see.\n\n200\n00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,924\nI could go to Nathan's computer here.\n\n201\n00:09:11,924 --> 00:09:14,310\nUnderneath the homegroup and from there,\n\n202\n00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,960\nnotice that these are the two extra\nfolders that Nate just shared out, right?\n\n203\n00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,392\nSo on the Game Codes here,\nthe one that he gave me read and,\n\n204\n00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:26,835\nand write access, Bad Dudes okay.\n\n205\n00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:29,276\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that's the one I could,\n\n206\n00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:32,320\nin theory then, create something.\n\n207\n00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,710\nLet's see.\nMy rich text document here.\n\n208\n00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,335\nOkay.\n\n209\n00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:40,543\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n210\n00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:41,501\nOkay.\n\n211\n00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:42,252\nSo, so there you go.\n\n212\n00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,210\nThere's your game code for Solitaire.\n\n213\n00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,517\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n214\n00:09:45,517 --> 00:09:46,543\n>> Yeah.\n\n215\n00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:47,043\n>> All right.\n\n216\n00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:47,751\n>> Yep.\n\n217\n00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:49,490\nAnd then let's check out the other one.\n\n218\n00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,534\nOkay, so I'm just going to click back\non Nathan's name on the bread crumb\n\n219\n00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:53,085\nbar up here.\n\n220\n00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:55,918\nAnd then I'm go to Game Guides and\nnow let's see, it's empty.\n\n221\n00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:03,259\nOh, there it is,\nnotice it actually says hey,\n\n222\n00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:07,880\nI need permissions to build or perform\nthis particular action for us, okay?\n\n223\n00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,418\nSo, it doesn't actually allow\nme to do that, so there it is.\n\n224\n00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:15,543\nWe have some control even when\nsharing this out over a home group.\n\n225\n00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:18,160\n>> All right so\nI just I quickly created a new file,\n\n226\n00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,987\njust called it new guide\n>> And yeah and so\n\n227\n00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,520\nRonnie, you should be able\njust to browse into that file.\n\n228\n00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,900\nCourse it,\nit would just be empty hanging out there.\n\n229\n00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,710\nOn on your machine there.\n\n230\n00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,440\nAnd so it yeah should be able\nto browse into that guy and\n\n231\n00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,510\neverything should be fine.\n\n232\n00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,750\nAll right.\nNow, as far as other settings,\n\n233\n00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,100\nright, into the homegroup you know,\n\n234\n00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,700\nWindows automatically manages\na lot of aspects of it.\n\n235\n00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,470\nSo you, you know, the shared files and\nthe folders, pretty pretty simple and\n\n236\n00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,840\nstraight up forward.\n\n237\n00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,120\nNow, as far the other setting\nalong with it you know,\n\n238\n00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,170\nwe can choose what we're sharing with\nthe homegroup with this item here.\n\n239\n00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,240\nIt brings us back to this, this menu.\n\n240\n00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,100\nYou know, change our password, or\n\n241\n00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,870\nwe just simply click there to leave\nthe homegroup, so we would leave.\n\n242\n00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,320\nNow, since I created it, if I leave,\nit still, it still stays there.\n\n243\n00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,020\nAs long as there are members\nstill joined to this home group.\n\n244\n00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,170\nThen Ronnie would you know,\n\n245\n00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,620\nhe would be the only,\nonly member in the little homegroup there.\n\n246\n00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,570\nAnd so to,\nI guess get rid of the homegroup.\n\n247\n00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,870\nIf Ronnie then left, then the home\ngroup would then cease to exist and\n\n248\n00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,930\nthen somebody else on the network\ncould then fire one up.\n\n249\n00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,600\n>> Yeah, so\nremember that on any one single network,\n\n250\n00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,960\nyou can only have one homegroup at a time,\nis what it comes down to.\n\n251\n00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,790\nOkay, and if there is one already created,\n\n252\n00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,990\nyou're not going to be able\nto create an extra one here.\n\n253\n00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,220\nSo only one can be there.\n\n254\n00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,990\nSo, as long as you actually have one,\ndon't worry about you know,\n\n255\n00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,015\nhaving to try and figure you\nwhose homegroup you're a part of.\n\n256\n00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:44,540\nMm-hm.\n\n257\n00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,627\n>> Yep, very easy.\n\n258\n00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:48,168\nYeah, you know, I,\nI use homegroups at at my house.\n\n259\n00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:48,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n260\n00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,835\n>> You know, we've got you know, I, I've\ngot this laptop, my wife has a laptop, and\n\n261\n00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:53,660\nI have a desktop.\n\n262\n00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,760\nAnd there's a,\na computer in the kitchen and\n\n263\n00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,630\nthe, the media server\nthat hosts all the files.\n\n264\n00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,750\nThey're all part of a homegroup.\n\n265\n00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,476\nAnd so to share files around,\nit is incredibly easy, straight forward.\n\n266\n00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:06,133\nJust a simple right-click and\nset things up there and yeah,\n\n267\n00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,876\nthat's awfully convenient.\n\n268\n00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:10,848\n>> Yeah, it makes it nice and\nconvenient for everyone,\n\n269\n00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:15,160\nregardless of what their particular\nnetworking skill actually is.\n\n270\n00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,280\nAll you have to do is say,\nhey, where can I find that?\n\n271\n00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,702\nYou go over to Homegroup and\nsay, point at that computer.\n\n272\n00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:21,218\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you're ready to go.\n\n273\n00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:21,848\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n274\n00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:22,930\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n275\n00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,950\nSo that so that, that's good for\nyou know, yeah, just a handful of people,\n\n276\n00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,760\nyou know, in the home not not too crazy.\n\n277\n00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,650\nBut let's say that you are part of\na of a domain that many computers,\n\n278\n00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,500\nthere's another solution out that's\na bit more easier to scale, so to say.\n\n279\n00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,585\nRight, a workplace join.\n\n280\n00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:42,705\n>> Yup.\n\n281\n00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:46,395\nNow, for us,\nin terms of this idea of work place join,\n\n282\n00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:49,645\nokay, this is kind of\nan unusual solution for us.\n\n283\n00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:50,405\nOkay.\n\n284\n00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:53,985\nFor us, in terms of networking, there's\nalways been either devices that are a part\n\n285\n00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:57,095\nof the network, or devices that\nwere not a part of the network, and\n\n286\n00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:59,075\nthat was the security\nboundary that we had.\n\n287\n00:12:59,075 --> 00:12:59,785\nOkay.\n\n288\n00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:00,855\nSo if you are part of a network,\n\n289\n00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:04,550\nyou could use the resources on that\nnetwork, if you weren't a part of network,\n\n290\n00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,710\nyou can use any of the resources that\nwere a part of the network here.\n\n291\n00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,310\nBut once again, because of the popularity\nof our favorite buzz phrase that we've\n\n292\n00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,900\nbeen using over and over again,\nBYOD, bring your own device.\n\n293\n00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,190\nThis has become a little\nbit more challenging, and\n\n294\n00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,620\nthe reason why is that\nthere are some devices\n\n295\n00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,160\nthat have no capability of becoming\npart of that particular security group.\n\n296\n00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,950\nOkay?\n\n297\n00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,480\nBut, there's also, of course, today, the,\nthe popular and the growing popularity\n\n298\n00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,980\nof the idea that there are more devices,\nmaybe even that are not a part of network,\n\n299\n00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,460\nthat still need access\nto resources inside.\n\n300\n00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,270\nSo you can think about the idea\nof someone, let's say,\n\n301\n00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,390\nthat's doing telecommuting, right?\n\n302\n00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,400\nSomeone that's working from home but\n\n303\n00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,080\nmay still need access to some of the\nresources that are on your network here.\n\n304\n00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,130\nBut, they don't have at their home,\nright, an extension to,\n\n305\n00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,080\nto reach out and\nto be a part of that domain here.\n\n306\n00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,880\nWhat we can do,\nespecially if it's a limited access,\n\n307\n00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,090\nis to create what we call\na work place join instead.\n\n308\n00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,157\nNow, the creation of the workplace\njoin for us is really more of\n\n309\n00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:10,168\nthe server level content in terms\nof creating it and doing it.\n\n310\n00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:12,793\nAnd the reason why is because\nit involves a lot of different.\n\n311\n00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:13,733\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n312\n00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:14,510\n>> S infrastructure.\n\n313\n00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,200\nRight?\n\n314\n00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,180\nIt involves you actually creating groups\n\n315\n00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,880\ninside of your active directory\ndomain if you want to.\n\n316\n00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,960\nIt involves you, again,\n\n317\n00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,180\nactually ensuring that you're running\nsome type of certificate server.\n\n318\n00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,360\nIt involves you creating, what we call, an\nactive directory federation service here.\n\n319\n00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840\nAnd even a proxy server,\n\n320\n00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,380\nso that you can actually get\naccess to some of those resources.\n\n321\n00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,495\nWell, we're not doing that here.\n\n322\n00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,530\n[LAUGH] Is what we're not doing.\n\n323\n00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,500\nBut we do want you to actually see that\nit is very possible for you to do it.\n\n324\n00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,593\nWhat makes this possible is not Windows 8,\nbut Windows 8.1.\n\n325\n00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,580\nOkay?\nWindows 8.1,\n\n326\n00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,475\nif you wanted to be able to do this,\nyou can.\n\n327\n00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:53,000\nAnd so, the good thing is,\nwe've got a demo set up here\n\n328\n00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,240\nto just show you how easy it is for\nit to be configured.\n\n329\n00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,860\nOkay?\n\n330\n00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,460\nSo, let me go ahead and\nbring that up here so\n\n331\n00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,720\nthat we can see it is what I want to do.\n\n332\n00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,310\nOkay?\n\n333\n00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,850\nNow, again,\nmy scree is just a tad bit small and\n\n334\n00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,560\nthat's just because of the,\nthe way the environment works.\n\n335\n00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,940\nNow I'm using a TechNet lab\nto kind of help us out here.\n\n336\n00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,070\nAnd I've now increased\nthe screen size a little bit so\n\n337\n00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,480\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n338\n00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,785\nI can't guarantee you'll\nsee it the greatest.\n\n339\n00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,030\n'Kay?\n\n340\n00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:25,175\nThis particular computer is not a part of\nthe actual network that it, that we're on.\n\n341\n00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:25,790\n'Kay?\n\n342\n00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,960\nSo, what we have here is the fictional\nnetwork called contoso.com, okay?\n\n343\n00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,130\nOne that Microsoft has put out there on,\nyou know,\n\n344\n00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,330\nthat you can actually go and, and to\nthe same lag, same lab from TechNet, okay.\n\n345\n00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,340\nBut it actually gives, gives us the\nability then to take this computer that\n\n346\n00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,870\nmay be sitting at home and notice this\nguy is, he's in a work group, okay?\n\n347\n00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,150\nSo he's not a part of the domain.\n\n348\n00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,095\nHe's logged in as a home user as a generic\naspect of, of what we can do, okay?\n\n349\n00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:55,649\nBut if I've got the infrastructure set up\nAnd I have devices again that are actually\n\n350\n00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,390\nright at the edge ready to\naccept these connections here.\n\n351\n00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,520\nI need that ability to\nactually be able to join\n\n352\n00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,790\nwhat we call the idea\nof the workplace join.\n\n353\n00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,040\n'Kay?\nThe way that Windows 8.1 does it and\n\n354\n00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,680\nthis is where it's key for\nus as technicians, right?\n\n355\n00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,650\nAnd we're helping someone set this up,\nis that we don't actually have to look for\n\n356\n00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,810\na, a ton of extra programs.\n\n357\n00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:21,010\nWe don't have to download anything, but\nwe simply go to our start screen and\n\n358\n00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,500\nI can talk in, type in, excuse me.\n\n359\n00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,190\nType in the word workplace and\nright here at the top.\n\n360\n00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,370\nSee if I can increase the zoom\njust a little bit here, 'kay.\n\n361\n00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,220\nRight here, oops, I did it again.\n\n362\n00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,650\nThere we go.\n\n363\n00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,730\nRight here, you actually see\nwhere it says workplace settings.\n\n364\n00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,670\nOkay?\n\n365\n00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,978\nSo, if I select the workplace\nsettings there, and\n\n366\n00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:57,498\nI click okay uh-oh.\n\n367\n00:16:57,498 --> 00:16:59,335\nLet me click.\n\n368\n00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:00,025\nThere we go, okay.\n\n369\n00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:02,342\nI was gonna say,\nI'm getting the wrong result here, okay?\n\n370\n00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:03,655\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was for me and\n\n371\n00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,535\nnot able to fall onto it\nthe way that I'm clicking it.\n\n372\n00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:11,405\nSo, right here it says, enter your\nuser ID to get workplace access or\n\n373\n00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,180\nto turn on device manager.\n\n374\n00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,480\nOkay?\n\n375\n00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,830\nNow, this is where it is something that\nyou have to actually monitor and, and\n\n376\n00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,956\nunderstand to know, okay.\n\n377\n00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:25,930\nThe workplace ID is actually an ID\nthat's usually identical to your,\n\n378\n00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,900\nyour workplace email, okay.\n\n379\n00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,590\nNot always, but\ngenerall it's gonna be that.\n\n380\n00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,245\nSo, the user that's actually a part of\nthis domain, his name is Ben Smith.\n\n381\n00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:36,365\nOkay.\n\n382\n00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:40,280\nAt contosa.com.\n\n383\n00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,970\nOkay.\n\n384\n00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,600\nNow even though it looks like an email\nit's, it's actually what they call some\n\n385\n00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,040\nother ID, you know as the, the user ID on\nthe network is what this one actually is.\n\n386\n00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,390\nAnd notice from here it\ngives me two options.\n\n387\n00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,030\n'Kay?\n\n388\n00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,770\nHey I may just want to\nturn on device manager.\n\n389\n00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,580\nThat's not what I wanna do.\n\n390\n00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,250\n'Kay.\n\n391\n00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,050\nBut notice what it does.\n\n392\n00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,390\nIt says with device manager turned on\nyour I, your IT admin can set up apps and\n\n393\n00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,810\nservices for you.\n\n394\n00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,740\nSound pretty cool.\n\n395\n00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,590\n'Kay.\n\n396\n00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,910\nBut the one we want is\nJoin Your Workplace Network so\n\n397\n00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:11,930\nthat you can use network resources like\ninternal, websites and business apps.\n\n398\n00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:15,700\nSo, this is really designed for\nus to actually be able to use again apps.\n\n399\n00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,180\nJust like things from the Window store and\nstuff like that.\n\n400\n00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,580\nThings that we set up on the proxy\nserver that we can access, okay.\n\n401\n00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,270\nSo, it doesn't really allow you\nto do everything in the world but\n\n402\n00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,320\nit really is about the idea.\n\n403\n00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,910\nThe limited number of things you can do.\n\n404\n00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,095\nOnce I select join, it should connect and\nwe should get this here.\n\n405\n00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:33,830\n'Kay?\n\n406\n00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,635\nWhere it says all right\nconnecting to the Contoso-ADFS.\n\n407\n00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:38,420\n'Kay?.\n\n408\n00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,250\nIf you do not have this show up, more than\nlikely it means that the infrastructure is\n\n409\n00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,970\nnot there for you and\nyou're not ready to actually connect yet.\n\n410\n00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,510\nADFS stands for active directory,\nFS, federation services.\n\n411\n00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,230\nOkay?\n\n412\n00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,830\nSo, here it is.\n\n413\n00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:59,170\nIt sees the user account I typed in there,\nand now it needs my password.\n\n414\n00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:05,092\nI just have to remember\nthe password here and\n\n415\n00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:08,308\nthen as long as I typed in\nthe password correctly,\n\n416\n00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:11,820\nit should connect to the work place and\nthere it is.\n\n417\n00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,610\nNow this account has\njoined the work place.\n\n418\n00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,370\nNow how do I know it's actually\njoined the work place?\n\n419\n00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,200\nWell let me show you what I,\nwhat we do here.\n\n420\n00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,811\nAll right so,\nI'm gonna go back to the desktop or\n\n421\n00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:28,831\nat least I hope I am and\nshow you a couple of things.\n\n422\n00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:29,621\nOkay?\n\n423\n00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:32,310\nSo, I'm going to take\na look at the certificates.\n\n424\n00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,050\nOkay?\n\n425\n00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,520\nAll of this is also based on\nthe idea of certificate services.\n\n426\n00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,800\nOkay?\n\n427\n00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,300\nThen being a part of the network already,\n\n428\n00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,906\nalready had the idea of a certificate\nof uniquely identifying him.\n\n429\n00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:45,656\nOkay?\n\n430\n00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:47,480\nSo, there it is.\n\n431\n00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,980\nThere's Ben Smith's\ncertificate right there and\n\n432\n00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,875\nagain let me kinda zoom in a little bit,\na little bit more so that we can see that.\n\n433\n00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,670\nOkay?\n\n434\n00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,570\nSo, there's Ben Smith's certificate and\n\n435\n00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,910\nyou see where it says\nContoso Enterprise Root here and\n\n436\n00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,810\nso he actually has this\ncertificate available to him.\n\n437\n00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,960\nTo be able to use.\n\n438\n00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,290\nBut the certificate that was just issued\nfor today, okay, oh, and not just for day.\n\n439\n00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,025\nNotice it expires in 50 years or so.\n\n440\n00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:12,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, whenever it is,\n\n441\n00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,940\nit's ten years from now,\nis what we have, right?\n\n442\n00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,450\nSo, this one right here.\n\n443\n00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,340\nOkay?\n\n444\n00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,420\nWell why is that important?\n\n445\n00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,400\nBecause this is what connects into\nmy domain that identifies that\n\n446\n00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,154\nthis computer can reach the domain and\ncan use the network resources.\n\n447\n00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:29,130\nOkay?\n\n448\n00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,050\nThe easiest way for us to verify this\nis to take a look really at these last\n\n449\n00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,910\nfour digits here, 'kay, oh I'm sorry\nmy mouse is a little bit skewed here,\n\n450\n00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:43,435\nthe last four digits right here as well\nas kinda these first four digits here.\n\n451\n00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:44,000\n'Kay?\n\n452\n00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,210\nNow it's hard to see but it with a AEF and\nthe last four digits here are 8533 Okay?\n\n453\n00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,420\nIs what we see.\n\n454\n00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,350\nSo, I'm getting a little bit of that\nscaling unusual aspect of this here.\n\n455\n00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:56,990\nOkay?\n\n456\n00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,672\nAll right so, that's what we need there.\n\n457\n00:20:58,672 --> 00:20:59,660\nAll right so,\n\n458\n00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,840\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\nswitch on over to the domain controller.\n\n459\n00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,310\nSo, the DC which is up at top.\n\n460\n00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,270\nI know the mouse doesn't\nlook like it's there but\n\n461\n00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,040\nI'm just switching on\nover to this machine.\n\n462\n00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,977\nAnd so,\nnow inside of the domain controller\n\n463\n00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:21,763\nhere I'm gonna bring up the server manager\n\n464\n00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,492\nand then from here I'm gonna go to manage,\nor not manage.\n\n465\n00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:33,020\nSorry.\nTools.\n\n466\n00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,300\nHid in the wrong one.\n\n467\n00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,550\nAnd this first link here that says active\ndirectory administrative center, Okay?\n\n468\n00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,270\nAgain my mouse is not exactly right but\n\n469\n00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,940\nit's the first link that\nyou see at the top.\n\n470\n00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,790\nAnd this is what you might have to do.\n\n471\n00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,790\nAs a technician if you're not able to get\naccess here you just need to verify that\n\n472\n00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,980\nthat certificate is gonna be where,\nwhere we normally would need it.\n\n473\n00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,400\nOkay?\n\n474\n00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,230\nSo, over on the left-hand side I'm\ngonna go into the Contoso link\n\n475\n00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,640\nover here on the side and\n\n476\n00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,320\nin the center detail section we're looking\nfor where it says registered devices.\n\n477\n00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,440\nNow I'm gonna move the mouse down there\nbut I'm way off the screen on my PC.\n\n478\n00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,760\nWhere it says registered devices.\n\n479\n00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,740\nLet me go ahead and click there.\n\n480\n00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:18,820\nAnd in the registered devices you\ncan now see that the certificate\n\n481\n00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,160\nwas registered not only with the machine\nwhere it was in the certificate store.\n\n482\n00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,200\nThe one that Ben Smith is on.\n\n483\n00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,870\nBut it is also here in the active\ndirectory management services here.\n\n484\n00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,410\nOkay?\n\n485\n00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:32,950\nSo, there it is.\n\n486\n00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,410\nIt begins with the A-E-F\nthat I told you and\n\n487\n00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,325\nnotice the last four digits over here\nif I could get the mouse over there.\n\n488\n00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:40,900\n8533.\n'Kay?\n\n489\n00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,420\nSo, even though that computer is\nnot joined to the network here\n\n490\n00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,290\nthe active directory network\nreally does see this computer and\n\n491\n00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,710\ncan now allow it because it is now\na registered device to be able to access\n\n492\n00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,472\nthe resources that we allow it to\nthrough that federation services proxy.\n\n493\n00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:01,336\n'Kay?\n\n494\n00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:05,230\nSo, In terms of the end user,\nokay, what do we have to support?\n\n495\n00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,690\nWe have to verify that they're\nreally on Windows 8.1.\n\n496\n00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,400\nOkay?\n\n497\n00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,890\nThey're not on 8.1, it's not gonna work.\n\n498\n00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:16,180\nSecondly they have to know what the actual\nuser ID is gonna be, and of course\n\n499\n00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,960\nthey actually have to be able to type in\nthe password that they're gonna have.\n\n500\n00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,620\nWhat you and I have to do of course then\nis verify in terms of the certificates\n\n501\n00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,540\nthat we do have the certificate\non there and that,\n\n502\n00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,620\nthat certificate is also registered\nright here underneath our\n\n503\n00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,885\nactive directory management console as\nwell under the administrative center.\n\n504\n00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:35,640\n'Kay?\n\n505\n00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,166\nSo, there's really not a lot that we\ncan do to troubleshoot in terms of\n\n506\n00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,560\nsupporting the actual\nuser here on Windows 8.1.\n\n507\n00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,870\nThe majority of the stuff here is gonna\nbe where it's gonna be a server admin or\n\n508\n00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,521\na network admin that's\ngonna have to come in and\n\n509\n00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:53,590\ngo all right what failed between this and\nthis server.\n\n510\n00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,002\nBut if it's set up and\nit's ready to go, we should be fine.\n\n511\n00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,268\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n512\n00:23:58,268 --> 00:23:59,247\n>> Nice.\n\n513\n00:23:59,247 --> 00:23:59,908\n>> There you go.\n\n514\n00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:00,807\n>> Yep.\n>> All right.\n\n515\n00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:01,900\n[COUGH] Good deal.\n\n516\n00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,030\nSo Ronnie, so let me ask you this then.\n\n517\n00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,340\n>> Okay.\n>> What, so\n\n518\n00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,120\nthen, so if they, active directory,\nso if it recognizes and, and\n\n519\n00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,895\nsees this machine, then in, in what cases\nthen would, would we use this workplace\n\n520\n00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:18,640\njoin as opposed to just joining that\nmachine up to the active directory.\n\n521\n00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,150\n>> Yep.\n\n522\n00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,160\nNow a lot of times,\n\n523\n00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,900\nit may be where you don't want to\nactually have a lot of machines\n\n524\n00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,840\nfloating outside of your network here that\nare just joined to your network, okay.\n\n525\n00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,060\nWhy?\nBecause somebody could pick up my laptop,\n\n526\n00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,240\nsteal it, and they may actually\nbe able to connect right in if\n\n527\n00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,180\nI've got all the VPN settings\non automatic, and they do that.\n\n528\n00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,370\nSo instead, what I can actually do is\nactually have this workplace join instead\n\n529\n00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,900\nwhere the device itself, even though it\nnow can use network resources, it's gonna\n\n530\n00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,710\nbe limited to only the ones that we\nwant to allow through that, that, what\n\n531\n00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,520\nwe call that proxy here, or the active\ndirectory federation services, okay?\n\n532\n00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,380\nSo it allows us to be able to do that.\n\n533\n00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,240\nSo there's also a lot of devices then,\nthat may not have again like I said at\n\n534\n00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,280\nthe beginning here, the ability to do\nwhat to actually join the network, okay?\n\n535\n00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,950\nSo for example, my iPad can't\njoin an active directory, no.\n\n536\n00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,210\nWell, again, using something like this may\nactually be an option that we have, yep.\n\n537\n00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:13,930\n>> Mm mm.\n\n538\n00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,090\nNice.\n\n539\n00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,380\nAll right, Good deal.\n\n540\n00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,010\nWell that yeah, anything else with\nthe workplace joined to toss out there?\n\n541\n00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,630\n>> Nope, remember that for us,\nthe setting here is, what?\n\n542\n00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,290\nis a couple of different\nscenarios regarding both of these\n\n543\n00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,660\ntechnologies, right?\n\n544\n00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,530\nWith workplace join, remember that\ncertain devices that are out there, okay,\n\n545\n00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,540\nthat really can't join the active\ndirectory network, but\n\n546\n00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,670\nstill needs access to those resources.\n\n547\n00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,010\nWith the home group, we make it easier for\npeople that may not actually know as,\n\n548\n00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,880\nas much as you know about networking, but\nalso, just may need to share files and,\n\n549\n00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,950\nand security's not really the biggest\nconcern in the world for us.\n\n550\n00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,855\nSo those are really two different\nscenarios that you may encounter.\n\n551\n00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:51,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n552\n00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> Quite quite a bit of contrast between\n\n553\n00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,330\nthat and you know,\nsetting up good old home groups.\n\n554\n00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> Um-hm.\n\n555\n00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,660\n>> Yeah.\n\n556\n00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,260\nThis one requires so\nmuch more infrastructure to be set up.\n\n557\n00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,890\nIt is,\n\n558\n00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,370\nit is incredible at how far reaching\nthat this technology can actually go.\n\n559\n00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,440\nHomegroup's nice and simple\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n560\n00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,260\n>> For sharing, but it is effective and\n\n561\n00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,060\nI guarantee you people will love you,\nyou can actually do that effectively.\n\n562\n00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,780\nEverybody loves being able to gain access\n\n563\n00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,630\nto Nate's Britney Spears\n>> Oh man.\n\n564\n00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:20,800\n>> Collection, you know of.\n\n565\n00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,440\n>> Nice.\n\n566\n00:26:21,440 -->

Pro TV,\n\n4\n00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:41,541\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,890\n>> Good morning.\n>> Good morning Ronnie.\n\n6\n00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,390\nHow are you?\n\n7\n00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,670\n>> All right.\nHow's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,660\n>> Yeah, it's going great.\n\n9\n00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,120\n>> Yeah?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n10\n00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,430\nI saw you speeding on\nthe freeway this morning.\n\n11\n00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,855\n>> Yes you did,\nat a whopping 65 miles per hour.\n\n12\n00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Since my car will max speed hit at 60,\n\n13\n00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,020\nyou did see me speeding.\n\n14\n00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,520\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n15\n00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,700\n>> That's as fast as it goes?\n\n16\n00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,879\n>> Yeah, downhill and- [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n17\n00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,460\nDo you remember those cars\nwhere you actually had to get,\n\n18\n00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,050\nout and I crank wind the front?\n\n19\n00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,650\nDid you have one of those?\n\n20\n00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,110\n>> I did not have one of those.\n\n21\n00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,120\n>> All right.\n>> I do have a Toyota Camry that has 88\n\n22\n00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,610\nhorsepower but that's about it.\n\n23\n00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,340\n>> A Camry?\n>> A Camry.\n\n24\n00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,540\n>> That's the number one,\nbest selling car in America.\n\n25\n00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,330\n>> In all time.\n\n26\n00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:19,860\n>> Yes.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n27\n00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,640\n>> Yes.\n\n28\n00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,925\nToo bad mines like from,\nyou know, the last century.\n\n29\n00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:26,930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well that then, yeah,\n\n30\n00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,820\nI don't have much to say about that.\n\n31\n00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,942\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's a, that's awesome.\n\n32\n00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:32,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,100\n>> All right, so today.\n\n34\n00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,480\nToday we have, for our episode today,\nis going to be in 70-688.\n\n35\n00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,290\n>> Right.\n\n36\n00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,672\n>> And for the official objective [SOUND].\n\n37\n00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:44,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As we scroll down,\n\n38\n00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,790\nso here we're skipping a few little\nbits in there and right there.\n\n39\n00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,730\nSo, under Support Data Security,\nidentify and\n\n40\n00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,640\nresolve issues related to, and we're\ngonna be covering today number three.\n\n41\n00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,270\n>> Number three.\n\n42\n00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,970\n>> Access to removable media.\n\n43\n00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> And by removable media,\n\n44\n00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,410\nwe're basically just talking\nabout USB drives, and\n\n45\n00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,495\nhow we can control access to them.\n\n46\n00:02:05,495 --> 00:02:07,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We can allow access,\n\n47\n00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,820\nwe can deny access.\n\n48\n00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,760\nWe can allow certain ones, and\ndeny certain ones, and we yeah,\n\n49\n00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,140\nI guess control who brings them in,\nand use what yeah.\n\n50\n00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,300\n>> Now, in terms of these,\ntypes of removable drives for us, right?\n\n51\n00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,420\nThere are so many different ones\nthat are actually out there.\n\n52\n00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,380\nAnd they all have different varying\ncapacities that we have, right?\n\n53\n00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,180\nSo, the original ones that I got were\nreally about the size of a thumb.\n\n54\n00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,120\nSo, a lot of times, it got that moniker,\nwhat we call a thumb drive here, and\n\n55\n00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,070\nthey supported varying capacities right?\n\n56\n00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,580\nThe very first one I ever got,\nactually supported like, I think it was\n\n57\n00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,300\nlike 32 megabytes if I remember is how\nmuch that thing actually supported.\n\n58\n00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,710\nAnd then it actually went up from that\nticker point up to 256, and then ended up\n\n59\n00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:59,330\ngetting gigs, and now they actually come\nin varieties of like 16 and 32 gigs.\n\n60\n00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,390\nAnd then you can now get portable hard\ndrives here that you can also stick in.\n\n61\n00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,350\nNow, in terms of those\nremovable drives for us,\n\n62\n00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,820\na matter of convenience, incredibly\nconvenient to be able to actually move\n\n63\n00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,430\na lot of data around on\nsomething that's fairly small.\n\n64\n00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,650\nThat I can put in my pocket, take on a\nplane, just go anywhere that I need to and\n\n65\n00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,270\nhave all that data with me.\n\n66\n00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,420\nOr I can simply take that drive,\nput data on it that I need to,\n\n67\n00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,900\nwalk it over to someone else.\n\n68\n00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,920\nAnd that drive is portable,\ncompact, usually relatively safe.\n\n69\n00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,730\nIn terms of actually moving\nall the stuff around.\n\n70\n00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,610\nBut, in the same sentence here,\n\n71\n00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,240\nwe can also talk about\nthe dangers of that as well.\n\n72\n00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,750\nIf I have a thumb drive.\n\n73\n00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,020\nThat's incredibly small.\n\n74\n00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,570\nI have one right now.\n\n75\n00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:48,700\nIt barely is a, like almost a quarter\ninch in terms of how wide it is.\n\n76\n00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,980\nBut, it can actually hold 16 gigs\nof data that I've put on there.\n\n77\n00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,920\nWell, what if I went into your\norganization and was doing research and\n\n78\n00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,684\nI took 16 gigs of your research,\nand put it on to that little\n\n79\n00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:05,840\ntiny removable drive here,\nstuffed it into my pocket and walked out?\n\n80\n00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,710\nYou may never know that it's gone,\nso in that sense, and\n\n81\n00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,850\nthe same time as easy as it is to use, it\nis one of the devices that you hate to say\n\n82\n00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,720\nyou have a love-hate relationship with.\n\n83\n00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,930\nThe very fact that it's easy, and\nwe can use it a lot is incredible.\n\n84\n00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,950\nI use one just about every day.\n\n85\n00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,620\nBut at the same time,\nif I'm worried about security.\n\n86\n00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,960\nI do not like these things, because of\nhow easy it is for them to get by without\n\n87\n00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,870\nanybody actually taking a look at that,\nand that's where we also have issues.\n\n88\n00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,860\nSo what Nate is talking about here,\nis that ability to control these devices,\n\n89\n00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,280\nand how they get access to your network.\n\n90\n00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,370\nNow, we have caveats here, right?\n\n91\n00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,950\nBecause, hey, let's put everybody,\n\n92\n00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,690\nand who cares what devices that\nthey bring onto your network, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,640\nOr, you can do like a lot of\nthe military installations,\n\n94\n00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,370\nwhere the USB drives are totally, or\nthe USB ports are disabled, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,760\nWhere you can't even do\nanything using a USB, at all.\n\n96\n00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,010\nI even went on base one time, where they\nhad literally actually went ahead and\n\n97\n00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,870\nremoved the actually USB ports\nin the laptops themselves,\n\n98\n00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,450\nwhich I did not know that\nyou could actually do.\n\n99\n00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,360\n>> Hm.\n\n100\n00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,730\n>> So, we want to talk about the idea that\nin the middle here, which is the control.\n\n101\n00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,120\n>> And so, you know Ronnie, you mentioned\nthat if you walked into a place or you\n\n102\n00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,000\nresearched the department or whatever and\nput on 16 gigs of information, you know.\n\n103\n00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,990\nOf course if they had the object\naccess auditing turned on, then yeah,\n\n104\n00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,060\nthey would know that you were\npulling those documents often.\n\n105\n00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,690\n>> Good stuff.\n>> That is true.\n\n106\n00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,590\n>> So there you go.\n\n108\n00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,130\n>> So yeah, as long as you're doing\nobject access auditing [LAUGH] almost.\n\n109\n00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,160\n>> And reviewing the logs.\n\n110\n00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,560\n>> And you're reviewing the logs.\n\n111\n00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,150\nYep.\n\n112\n00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,582\nAnd you've turned them on and you're\ndiligently at your job, you are correct.\n\n113\n00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,050\n>> Yeah so,\nyou know controlling access to these,\n\n114\n00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,670\nthese USB devices isn't that,\nif I'm not mistaken, you know how.\n\n115\n00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,890\nOr the Edward Snowdon.\n\n116\n00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,306\nDidn't, isn't that how he got\nall of his documents off,\n\n117\n00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:02,660\non a pulling them out drive?\n\n118\n00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n119\n00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,310\nThat's it.\n\n120\n00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,730\nWalking out with them.\n\n121\n00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,547\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then heading over to, the Ukraine,\n\n122\n00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:09,910\nor wherever he's at.\n\n123\n00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,360\nHe's somewhere in\nthe European Union right now.\n\n124\n00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,180\nI don't know where.\n\n125\n00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,240\n>> Yeah, so you know, so restricting\naccess to use these devices, right.\n\n127\n00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,330\nI mean, you can really be.\n\n128\n00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,420\nI guess yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,310\nI mean ran in the security in your,\n\n130\n00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,120\non your facility\n>> And make sure that people\n\n131\n00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,580\naren't putting these drives in and\nwalking away with information.\n\n132\n00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,110\nYou know, and\nalso from an administrative point of view,\n\n133\n00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,470\nit can come down to just\nsupporting these devices.\n\n134\n00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,584\nNow, most USB devices are plug and play,\nright, you get a USB drive you pop it into\n\n135\n00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:42,107\nyour Windows 8.1 PC and it goes [SOUND]\nand it pulls up and it pops a little\n\n136\n00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:46,809\nwindow and it pulls down whatever driver\nit needs to use it and there you go.\n\n137\n00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:47,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n138\n00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,240\n>> Now, almost all of them,\nright, work just like.\n\n139\n00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,040\nLike that and it could be that some may or\nmay not work quite as easily as that,\n\n140\n00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,450\nyou know, perhaps the,\ndepending on the PCs, or\n\n141\n00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,190\nhowever your company is by limiting\naccess to a certain approved device.\n\n142\n00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,870\n>> Yeah!\n>> Or perhaps a device that,\n\n143\n00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,730\nyou will only allow rights to\nUSB drives that are encrypted.\n\n144\n00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,770\n>> So, you know,\nyou can control that data.\n\n145\n00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,270\nMake sure that it is encrypted, when\nthose drives leave the office incase they\n\n146\n00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,565\nare dropped or misplaced and,\nspeaking of which, so Ronny.\n\n147\n00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:22,350\n>> Mm-hm?\n\n148\n00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,811\n>> How many USB drives have you lost?\n\n149\n00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,878\n[CROSSTALK] Mm-hm.\n\n150\n00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:28,897\n>> One.\n[LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,347\n>> Oh, that's it?\n\n152\n00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:30,874\n>> Yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:31,401\n>> Okay.\n\n154\n00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,980\n>> I keep track of things pretty well.\n\n155\n00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,270\n>> Right?\n>> But, I don't own that many, however.\n\n156\n00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,510\n>> Well, even that like little,\nteeny, tiny.\n\n157\n00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,870\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> You still know where it's at?\n\n158\n00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,510\n>> I know where it's at.\n\n159\n00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,070\n>> Ho.\n>> Yeah.\n\n160\n00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,830\n>> Well, there goes my hello example then.\n\n161\n00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,388\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> Well.\n\n162\n00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:44,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,558\n>> All right, so, what was your point?\n\n164\n00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:49,040\n[LAUGH]\n>> The point is that they're easily lost.\n\n165\n00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,662\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n166\n00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:52,080\nI mean, I've lost a handful,\nand who knows,\n\n167\n00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,057\nwho knows where they go, and-\n>> Yeah.\n\n168\n00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:57,875\n>> Who knows what was on them, and what\nnot, but you know, they get misplaced.\n\n169\n00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,442\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And they can be stolen.\n\n170\n00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:02,889\nPerhaps if a person knows what\nis on a particular device.\n\n171\n00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:03,797\nDevice.\n\n172\n00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:05,955\nThen, I mean, theft is incredibly easy.\n\n173\n00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,670\n>> Yea, by far.\n\n174\n00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,620\n>> Yea.\nLock down on, on a P.C., you know,\n\n175\n00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,130\na little bit harder to steal\nan entire P.C. than to wait for\n\n176\n00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,870\nthat opportune moment, to just grab\nthat little USB drive and head on out.\n\n177\n00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,470\n>> Yea.\n\n178\n00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,500\nYou know and I just thought\nof another idea here also on,\n\n179\n00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,440\nin terms of the security.\n\n180\n00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,610\nNot only with people leaving, but\n\n181\n00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,710\nif you allow users to bring USB devices\neven from home a lot of times, right.\n\n182\n00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,270\nWell, you don't know what their security\nsetup is on their own personal computers,\n\n183\n00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,960\nit could be that that particular\ndevice got loaded up with a virus and\n\n184\n00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,180\nthen when you plug it into your device\nat work there you go you have other,\n\n185\n00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,870\nissues that you also have to\nactually deal with at that point.\n\n186\n00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,750\nSo, so don't forget.\n\n187\n00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,390\nThere's a lot of different issues that you\nshould actually be considering here and\n\n188\n00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,670\nthat you may actually wanna be\nable to control, access to.\n\n189\n00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,290\nOr that, the type of access that you\nwanna give to these USB devices,\n\n190\n00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,790\nthese removable drives I should say.\n\n191\n00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,800\nYep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n192\n00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,320\nYeah, you know and it, it can also\nkinda be like a double edged sword.\n\n193\n00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,040\n>> Right.\n>> So let's say that, you know,\n\n194\n00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,580\nthat your company's worried about,\nyou know, leaking data, or\n\n195\n00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,300\nnot, out of, out of your company-\n>> Right.\n\n196\n00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,230\n>> And so they want to rein in,\nyou know, those who use these USB d,\n\n197\n00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,840\ndevices and\njust turn them off all together so\n\n198\n00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,652\nthat probably gets pushed out and\nit's now on your laptop.\n\n199\n00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:22,910\nYou know,you head out to a meeting or\nsomething,\n\n200\n00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,010\nand for some reason you can't\nget on to the network, and\n\n201\n00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,970\nyou need to share files and whatnot so\nif you can't just plug in a thumb drive\n\n202\n00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,570\nto be able to share information,\nthen you know kind of a unique scenario.\n\n203\n00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,462\nBut I mean it can severely\nhinder productivity.\n\n204\n00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:38,309\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n205\n00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,701\n>> For something that's easy,\nand convenient,\n\n206\n00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:44,128\nto wipe out that access in the event that,\nyou know, you do need it.\n\n207\n00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:44,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n208\n00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,688\n>> You know, and it's not there.\n\n209\n00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:46,438\n>> Right.\n>> I mean it can.\n\n210\n00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:47,780\nYeah.\n\n211\n00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,980\nI'd, I'd sure be mad.\n\n212\n00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,030\n>> Yeah.\n\n213\n00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,880\nSo we wanna take a look then at some of\nthe different ways that we can control,\n\n214\n00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,025\nthe accessibility with these\nremovable drives here, okay?\n\n215\n00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:58,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n216\n00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,620\nwhat's the first one that we\nwant to actually take on,\n\n217\n00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,990\nyou want to drive right into\nthe group policy editor or what?\n\n218\n00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,090\nWhat do you wanna do?\n\n219\n00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,390\n>> Yeah, you know, you know what?\n\n220\n00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,310\nYeah, yeah, we should now,\nto control access to these things, it's,\n\n221\n00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,545\nyou know, just about all of it is gonna\nbe controlled through group policy.\n\n222\n00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:14,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n223\n00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,140\n>> And that is where we will spend\nthe majority of our time and\n\n224\n00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,140\nso, on my PC here, right?\n\n225\n00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,300\nTo get over to that, group policy, right,\nwe will use the local group policy for\n\n226\n00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,220\nthis and so,\nwe'll go to gpedit.msc pull up\n\n227\n00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,092\nour local group policy editor, duh duh,\nduh, duh slide that over some,\n\n228\n00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:41,090\nall right and in here,all right we\nare gonna go to computer configuration,\n\n229\n00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:45,290\nadministrative templates,\nsystem into system,\n\n230\n00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,500\nthen we'll scroll on down\n>> No,\n\n231\n00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,700\ntoo far\n>> Go to,\n\n232\n00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,830\nduh duh duh,\n>> Device\n\n233\n00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,920\n>> Device installation\n\n234\n00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,345\n>> And devices selection higher.\n\n235\n00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:55,977\n[SOUND]\n>> What's that?\n\n236\n00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,670\n>> That's driver installation.\n\n237\n00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,330\nDevices selection.\n\n238\n00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,010\n>> Oh, am I, am I then.\n\n239\n00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,220\nI was look ahead.\n\n240\n00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,390\n>> Yeah.\nA little bit higher one more.\n\n241\n00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,270\n>> Thank you Ronnie.\n\n242\n00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,810\nAnd device installation, you, I,\nI did that once with Don too and\n\n243\n00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,000\nI was clicking on something and he's like,\noh, that's, that's the wrong one Nate.\n\n244\n00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,100\nI'm like, oh I'm looking right at it.\n\n245\n00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,805\n>> All right.\n>> Yes you are.\n\n246\n00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:11,652\n[SOUND] There you go.\n\n247\n00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,180\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n248\n00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,100\nDevice installation, restrictions.\n\n249\n00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,885\nNow I'll just pause it up here so\nyou know, let's so just briefly.\n\n250\n00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:20,070\n>> Mm-Hm.\n>> Let's go in and, and\n\n251\n00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,380\njust click through each one of them and\ndiscuss what what they are and\n\n252\n00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,880\nhow they can fit in the overall thing.\n\n253\n00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,730\nAll right, does this very first\none allow administrators to\n\n254\n00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,170\noverride device installation\nrestriction policies?\n\n255\n00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,550\nRight pretty straightforward.\n\n256\n00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,640\n>> Yup.\n>> You know, if you do rule this,\n\n257\n00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,180\nthis policy out and you know, and for, for\n\n258\n00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,320\nyour manager or someone,\nyou know, who is at that meeting\n\n259\n00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,690\nwho needs to quickly share files they are\nnot connected to the network or any other.\n\n260\n00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,405\nKind of a ad hoc connection\nwith the other devices,\n\n261\n00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,190\nthen you know,\nyou can allow those administrators to\n\n262\n00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,170\nI guess not have this policy applied\nto them, and and still be able, well\n\n263\n00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,140\nI guess you could always use filtering-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n264\n00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,240\n>> As well to block those guys out,\n\n265\n00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,140\nbut any how so yeah\n>> Yeah.\n\n266\n00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,780\nSo now it won't affect everybody and\ncame to good in some settings.\n\n267\n00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,030\nOr in some scenarios.\n\n268\n00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,160\n>> Yep.\n\n269\n00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,200\nThe second one there says the what it,\nallow installation of\n\n270\n00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,960\ndevices using drivers that match,\nthese device setup classes here.\n\n271\n00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,260\nNow that's a little bit more technical for\nus at this point and Yuri do you have\n\n272\n00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,880\na device already plugged in or is that-\n>> No that is data.\n\n273\n00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,980\nNo, I wasn't sure if that was the example.\n\n274\n00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,260\nNow here notice as,\n\n275\n00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,790\nhow she says for us here, Dash you have\nto match the actual setup classes.\n\n276\n00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,640\nAnd what those setup classes are actually\ndependant on, is where we actually have\n\n277\n00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,230\nthis kind of weird strange number that\nyou see over in the left-hand corner.\n\n278\n00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,610\nWe call it a guid or\na guide depending on who you listen to\n\n279\n00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,490\nthe globally unique identifier is what\nyou're actually having here, okay?\n\n280\n00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,920\nSo we can actually go ahead and do that,\nas long as they match that same one.\n\n281\n00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,610\nBut other devices here, right, so\n\n282\n00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,490\ndifferent manufacturers will end\nup with different, ones of here.\n\n283\n00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,130\nSo you can limit it essentially to that\none manufacturer, I guess, if you wanted\n\n284\n00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,275\nto or even that one particular type\nof that manufacturer's device.\n\n285\n00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n286\n00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,428\nYeah, you know, and, and with these,\nwith these GUID here, I mean they are,\n\n287\n00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:10,860\nyou know, just this like, global you know,\nglobally kind of identifier here, so\n\n288\n00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,240\nthen all USB drives-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n289\n00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,060\n>> Will have a, a particular GUID.\n\n290\n00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,030\nYou know, all all hard drives-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,865\n>> All CD Roms, everything will have the,\nthe same GUID on there.\n\n292\n00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:20,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n293\n00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,715\nthis is, you know\n>> Yeah,\n\n294\n00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:24,735\ncan be just a one stop shop\nto just wipe out you know,\n\n295\n00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:28,135\nthat that yeah, drive altogether.\n\n296\n00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:29,272\n>> Yeah.\n>> Anything else.\n\n297\n00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:33,298\n>> Yeah, so that way we limit our self\nto just this one drive, and that way so\n\n298\n00:13:33,298 --> 00:13:35,600\nif you want to say I only want.\n\n299\n00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,730\nYou know Corsair drives,\nyou could actually do it that way.\n\n300\n00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,560\nAnd then, somebody tries to bring in a\nKingston drive or something like that, or\n\n301\n00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,430\na Toshiba, it's not gonna work.\n\n302\n00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,170\n>> Mm, yeah now,\nnow to lock it down by manufacturers.\n\n303\n00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,131\n>> Yeah.\n>> That one will we can [CROSSTALK] so\n\n304\n00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:52,737\nwe can lock that one down on a a policy\ncoming up, so yeah, these ones.\n\n305\n00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:55,106\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, a bit a bit generic there.\n\n306\n00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:56,010\n>> All right.\n\n307\n00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,000\n>> Now, so there's, there's two different\nkind of strategies to go about,\n\n308\n00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,760\nrestriction access to removal\ndrives we can block everything, and\n\n309\n00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,070\nonly allow certain ones.\n\n310\n00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,080\n>> There you go.\n\n311\n00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:13,220\n>> Or we can, allow everything and\njust block certain ones.\n\n312\n00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:13,900\n>> All right sounds good.\n\n313\n00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,530\n>> All right.\n\n314\n00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,390\nAnd so this one so like in the very\nfirst one, it says, you know,\n\n315\n00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,730\nallow installation of, of just these ones.\n\n316\n00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,040\nAnd the one below it,\nis prevent installation in devices\n\n317\n00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,520\nusing drivers that match\nthese device set-up classes.\n\n318\n00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,260\nSo, you know, this one just,\nlike the other one that allows,\n\n319\n00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,930\nthis one just denies those\nfrom being installed.\n\n320\n00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,060\nAll right.\n\n321\n00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,020\nThis very next one\n\n322\n00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,320\ndisplay a custom message when installation\nis prevented by a policy setting now,\n\n323\n00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,020\nlet's say that you're a user\n>> Mm-hm\n\n324\n00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,898\n>> And you go in\n\n325\n00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:49,733\nyou pop your USB drive in there and, and\nnothing happens you hear windows [SOUND]\n\n326\n00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:54,568\nyou know the little thing saying that it\nrecognized a device is plugged in, and\n\n327\n00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:59,327\nthen but nothing happens, you know\nright there is is help a help desk call\n\n328\n00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,340\nright there hey I'm plugging my device\nin nothing is working well, right here.\n\n329\n00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,700\nSo we can have a,\na custom message be displayed now.\n\n330\n00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,120\nI've, I've turned these on [LAUGH] and\nI've used them, and\n\n331\n00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,400\nthere's only one place where I've\nseen these these things pop up.\n\n332\n00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,585\nLike you know, I was expecting some\nkind of like a balloon window.\n\n333\n00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n334\n00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,050\n>> Or something, to pop up.\n\n335\n00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,040\nAnd perhaps perhaps it's my PC but\nI didn't get any kind of balloon.\n\n336\n00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,110\nThere's only one spot,\nwhere I actually saw these messages.\n\n337\n00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,380\nOkay.\n>> Where was that?\n\n338\n00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,980\n>> Mm, you know, we'll we,\nwe'll get to it.\n\n339\n00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,570\n>> Oh you're, you're holding on to that,\nfor a big surprise.\n\n340\n00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,141\n>> Yeah, well I.\n>> Okay.\n\n341\n00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,090\n>> I mean you have to go into the,\nyou know, device manager and, and\n\n342\n00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,337\nchoose to interrupt the driver that way.\n\n343\n00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,557\n>> Oh there we go.\nYeah.\n\n344\n00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:41,420\n>> And\nafter it fails then it it finally shows.\n\n345\n00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,120\nWe got a, kind of a strange thing.\n\n346\n00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,643\nSo, and we have two different types of,\nof places or messages that it pops up.\n\n347\n00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:51,459\nSo we have the first one display a custom\nmessage when installation is prevented by\n\n348\n00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:52,309\na policy setting.\n\n349\n00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:53,004\n>> Okay.\n\n350\n00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:53,609\n>> And then a title.\n\n351\n00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:58,325\nAnd below it That's what a custom message\ntitle when device installation is,\n\n352\n00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,870\nis prevented.\n\n353\n00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,550\nAnd, and both of those appear, one on\ntop of the other, in the same place.\n\n354\n00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,235\n>> There you go\n>> And that's the only place that I've,\n\n355\n00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,059\nI've seen those guys.\n\n356\n00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:08,939\n>> Okay, we'll wait for\nNathan's top secret.\n\n357\n00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:09,959\n>> Yeah.\n\n358\n00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,179\n[LAUGH]\n>> Bubble message here.\n\n359\n00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,182\nAll right?\n>> [LAUGH] And the next one,\n\n360\n00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,840\nI'll allow installation of devices\nthat match any of these device IDs.\n\n361\n00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,159\nNow this one right here,\nwe can restrict it down to a manufacturer.\n\n362\n00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,640\n>> Mm-hm\n>> A type, a very specific one.\n\n363\n00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,148\nAnd there are different levels that that\nwhich we choose to restrict those devices.\n\n364\n00:16:29,148 --> 00:16:34,027\nWe can restrict it down, like in\nthe example down there it has a Gen disk.\n\n365\n00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:37,708\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Gen disk is like the lowest level Of I\n\n366\n00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,640\nguess, classifying these removable.\n\n367\n00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,780\n>> Yep.\n>> Devices.\n\n368\n00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,900\nAnd it, it's similar to the gosh, not,\n\n369\n00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,620\nnot software restriction policies,\nwhat's that app blocker.\n\n370\n00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,150\n>> App blocker.\n\n371\n00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,620\n>> App blocker.\nYou know, your app blocker and\n\n372\n00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,510\nyou go to restrict apps.\n\n373\n00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,589\nYou have that little slider bar.\n\n374\n00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:57,617\nAnd you can slide it all the way\nup to you know, to, I guess,\n\n375\n00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,789\nreduce the clear down to Microsoft.\n\n376\n00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:00,289\n>> Sure.\n\n377\n00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:06,774\n>> Or all the way down to restrict it to\nit's, the you know, the what's it doing?\n\n378\n00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,654\n>> The version of the application, right.\n\n379\n00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,420\n>> Okay.\n>> I mean you get real granular, and\n\n380\n00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,475\nthis is more or\nless kind of the same thing.\n\n381\n00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:15,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You're reduced down to USB, composite,\n\n382\n00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,200\nand it's pretty generic and we'll,\nfor this one, allow installation.\n\n383\n00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,910\nWill allow, yeah, yeah.\n\n384\n00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,255\n>> A majority of different ones.\n\n385\n00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:23,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n386\n00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,872\n>> Or the next one,\n\n387\n00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:29,479\nwhich is prevent installation of devices\nthat match any of these device IDs.\n\n388\n00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:30,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n389\n00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,450\n>> We can block it.\n\n390\n00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,999\nWe can block them down\nvery generically and\n\n391\n00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:38,654\nreally restrict these\nguy down quite a bit.\n\n392\n00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:42,192\nAll right, the next one here\ntime in seconds to force a,\n\n393\n00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:46,905\nto force reboot when required for\napplying these changes to take affect.\n\n394\n00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,169\nSo applying these changes roll out.\n\n395\n00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:52,289\nYeah, yeah set the time and\nforce that that reboot so\n\n396\n00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:54,120\nthese policies can take affect.\n\n397\n00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,460\nThis next one here, prevent installation\n>> Yep.\n\n398\n00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,340\n>> of removable devices.\n\n399\n00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,588\n[LAUGH]\n>> This one here will just\n\n400\n00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:03,250\nblock everything.\n\n401\n00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,478\n>> Yep.\n>> Right?\n\n402\n00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:08,639\nNothing, nothing will will work with\nthis guy so if you just want, you know,\n\n403\n00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,783\nnot allow them, I guess that\nsince you were at, at the base.\n\n404\n00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:12,303\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n405\n00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:14,880\n>> And I, yeah, USB port's disabled.\n\n406\n00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,730\n>> That's it.\n\n407\n00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,592\n>> This guy right here, I mean yeah,\nit would just block, yeah,\n\n408\n00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:19,519\nknock them all out.\n\n409\n00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,179\n>> Yep.\n>> Altogether.\n\n410\n00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,399\n>> But.\n\n411\n00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:23,499\n>> And the last one.\n\n412\n00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,260\n>> The very last one here, right?\n\n413\n00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,870\nPrevent installation of devices not\ndescribed by other policy settings.\n\n414\n00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,234\nNow with these policy settings to reduce\nthings depending on the types of scenarios\n\n415\n00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:39,159\nwhere you want to either allow or\ndeny certain ones deny everything and\n\n416\n00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,672\nonly allow, or allow everything and\nonly deny certain ones.\n\n417\n00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:46,570\nYou know, they, they work a combination\nof these policies settings.\n\n418\n00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n419\n00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,640\n>> And this one here, so, let's say,\nyou have a, a policy setting.\n\n420\n00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,540\nAnd let's,\nwe'll pick all right this oh right there,\n\n421\n00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,460\nallow insulation of devices that\nmatch any of these device IDs.\n\n422\n00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:06,540\nSo, we can allow certain ones and we can\nhave this posse here let us pull it up,\n\n423\n00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,920\nfor insulation of devices not described.\n\n424\n00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,270\nAnd this one, they will work together.\n\n425\n00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,870\nSo we can allow certain ones,\n\n426\n00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,560\nnow with this policy,\nwe can just block everything else.\n\n427\n00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,200\n>> Yeah.\n\n428\n00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,541\nSo it just pretty much is saying that for\nus, right,\n\n429\n00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,272\nif it's not explicitly called out,\nlet's go and block it.\n\n430\n00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:23,011\n>> Mm, yep.\n\n431\n00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:27,459\nNow with, you know, with, with some of\nthese, that, like the, that one there,\n\n432\n00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,620\nallows installation of\ndevices with the device ids.\n\n433\n00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,350\n>> Now, you know, there are a number of of\nUSB devices that will have the I guess,\n\n434\n00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,295\nfor how far you lock it down.\n\n435\n00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:38,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n436\n00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,535\n>> Can have the,\nthe same kind of device IDs on there.\n\n437\n00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:43,317\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And you know, and so\n\n438\n00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:47,106\nyou can end up blocking more than\nthan you want to or you know,\n\n439\n00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:50,147\njust kind of run into yourself\nblocking these guys out.\n\n440\n00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:52,950\n>> Yep.\n\n441\n00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,260\nSo for us, these policy settings are you\ncan see how granular you can get.\n\n442\n00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,110\nRemember that there's really two type\nof policies that were mentioned, okay?\n\n443\n00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,030\nIs either, let's explicitly list\nwhat we actually won't allow and\n\n444\n00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,600\nthen block everything else or we go ahead\nand say hey, let's prevent only these and\n\n445\n00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,040\nallow everything else.\n\n446\n00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,750\nAnd then at the end there we have the one\nthat says look, if it's not explicitly\n\n447\n00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,050\ncaught up anywhere in any policy,\nlet's just go ahead and block it.\n\n448\n00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,250\n>> All right so Ronnie.\n\n449\n00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,930\n>> Yes?\n\n450\n00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,500\n>> Let I guess let's\nconfigure some of these.\n\n451\n00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,250\n>> Let's configure.\n\n452\n00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,439\n>> And and put it to work for us.\n\n453\n00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,559\n>> Sounds good.\n\n454\n00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,250\n>> All right, so let so look,\nwe'll come up with a scenario.\n\n455\n00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,180\n>> Okay?\n>> All right let's say that ITProTV,\n\n456\n00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,910\nthat so we want to only allow\na certain kind of USB drive.\n\n457\n00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,010\n>> Okay.\n>> But block all the other ones.\n\n458\n00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,550\n>> All right.\n\n459\n00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,100\n>> All right.\n\n460\n00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,520\nSo, we have two USB devices here.\n\n461\n00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:51,019\nAll right, so we've got this guy\nhere has a USB 3.0 little drive,\n\n462\n00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:55,270\nso we'll use this one and\nthen we've got one here.\n\n463\n00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,110\n>> Little tiny one.\n\n464\n00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,660\nThere you go.\n\n465\n00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,756\nIt's small.\n>> This little this little tiny one I,\n\n466\n00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,880\nI have on a little key chain\nwith my fob little pen knife.\n\n467\n00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,410\nSo we will allow this little guy.\n\n468\n00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,050\n>> Okay.\n\n469\n00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,170\nSounds good.\n>> But we will block everything else.\n\n470\n00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,478\n>> Okay.\n>> And so we'll use this one here as a I\n\n471\n00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,429\nguess as one to I guess\nshow all the other ones.\n\n472\n00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:13,129\n>> The block.\n\n473\n00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,800\nMm-hm.\nSounds good.\n\n474\n00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,560\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n475\n00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,760\n>> All right.\n>> So.\n\n476\n00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,388\nBased off of what we just talked about.\n\n477\n00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:19,219\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n478\n00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:22,118\n>> What where are we going to begin?\n\n479\n00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:25,735\n>> You are going to begin by\nallowing the devices that match any\n\n480\n00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:27,049\nof these on the list.\n\n481\n00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:27,709\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n482\n00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:33,469\nAll right, okay so the very first one is\n>> I don't want the unit is.\n\n483\n00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:34,930\nWe'll, we'll grab the, the device review.\n\n484\n00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,430\n>> Yup, yeah.\n\n485\n00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,070\n>> All right.\n\n486\n00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,155\nSo first things first, what we'll do is,\n\n487\n00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:43,410\nthis is one that we'll allow and\nwe just pop it in the PC here.\n\n488\n00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,710\nYou know what's funny?\n\n489\n00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,647\n>> What?\n>> I didn't,\n\n490\n00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:49,129\nI didn't check to see\nwhat was on these things.\n\n491\n00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:51,104\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n492\n00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:54,110\n>> That's all right.\n\n493\n00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,120\n>> Might look like it's showing up.\n\n494\n00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,520\nOr is that not it?\n\n495\n00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,020\n>> Hm.\n\n496\n00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,700\nImagine that.\n\n497\n00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,160\n>> Imagine that.\n\n498\n00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,989\n>> So we have nothing applied, currently.\n\n499\n00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:13,580\nYep, nothing did you, did you apply\nsomething and not realize it.\n\n500\n00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,709\n>> [SOUND] There it goes,\nokay, I had to pull\n\n501\n00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:22,699\nthe slide USB port that's that's no good.\n\n502\n00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:23,878\n>> No.\n>> All right, so\n\n503\n00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:26,200\nnext time I'll just put it in slightly.\n\n504\n00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,730\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n505\n00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,000\n>> Gently.\n>> Gently, all right.\n\n506\n00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,660\nSo here we go.\n\n507\n00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,350\nSo there is the,\nthe one that we will allow.\n\n508\n00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,170\nNow we need to grab that device ID.\n\n509\n00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,320\nSo we can click on this guy.\n\n510\n00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,659\nAnd go into properties.\n\n511\n00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:42,244\nAnd yeah, there's more than one way\nto grab these device IDs but for\n\n512\n00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:47,393\nthis one we just click on hardware and\nthere's the internal SSD drive,\n\n513\n00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:49,500\nso we got that guy right there.\n\n514\n00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,350\nI'm gonna click on properties\nin the details tab.\n\n515\n00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,510\nAnd down in the hardware IDs.\n\n516\n00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,620\n>> There you go.\n>> And there's different ones.\n\n517\n00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,640\nAll right, so it kinda starts at\nthe top being the most specific and\n\n518\n00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,250\nworking the way down to\nbeing the most generic.\n\n519\n00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:13,050\nSo at the very bottom, gendisk, I mean\nthat, that'll cover everything moving up\n\n520\n00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:18,900\nright USB store and, and that one there\nKingston DataTraveler for those different\n\n521\n00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,240\nlines all the way up to the very top\nwhich would be for this specific one.\n\n522\n00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,840\nNow, what, we'll just choose.\n\n523\n00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,920\nDa dum, yeah,\nI guess that one right there is fine.\n\n524\n00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,460\nAll right, so I'll just right\nclick on that and choose copy.\n\n525\n00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,699\nAnd let's jump back to our policy and\nit was that one there?\n\n526\n00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:41,120\n>> Yep.\n\n527\n00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,319\n>> Turn that one on, and\nwe will enable this.\n\n528\n00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,860\nClick on Show.\n\n529\n00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,520\nAnd let's go and drop that one there.\n\n530\n00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,869\n>> Click on.\n>> All right, so\n\n531\n00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:56,163\nthe first thing we have to do is actually\nretrieve that hardware device ID and so\n\n532\n00:23:56,163 --> 00:23:59,367\nNate just showed us how to do\nthat using the control panel.\n\n533\n00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:04,830\nUh,and into the device manager for\nus to be able to find that device ID.\n\n534\n00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,000\nAnd then we're going to take it\nback to our group policy here and\n\n535\n00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,146\nhave it apply inside there.\n\n536\n00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:13,180\nAll right?\n\n537\n00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,888\n>> There we go, so now we're allowing,\nallowing this device.\n\n538\n00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:19,160\n>> Okay\n>> All right,so now let's just go ahead\n\n539\n00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,920\nand safely eject this guy since\nwe've got that part done, all right?\n\n540\n00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,940\nAnd now let, let's do a custom message.\n\n541\n00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,020\nAll right, so Ronnie\n>> Yes.\n\n542\n00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,550\n>> We've got 128 characters.\n\n543\n00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,200\nWhat is our custom message?\n\n544\n00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,630\nThis can pop up when it is\nbreeding prevented by policy.\n\n545\n00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,034\n>> This device is allowed.\n\n546\n00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:42,960\nOver is prevented?\n\n547\n00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,120\n>> When it's prevented?\n\n548\n00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,180\n>> When it's prevented?\n\n549\n00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,780\nOkay.\n\n550\n00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,032\nYour device is not allowed.\n\n551\n00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:55,760\n>> [LAUGH] Go straight there,\ndo not pass go, go straight there.\n\n552\n00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,310\n>> Straight to jail.\n\n553\n00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,925\nAll right, so we guess,\nnow we've got our custom message.\n\n554\n00:24:58,925 --> 00:24:59,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n555\n00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,320\n>> And so now what we'll do for\nthis scenario.\n\n556\n00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,890\nSo we want to allow this\none approved device,\n\n557\n00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,909\nso our little Kingston data traveler,\nwe want to block everything else out.\n\n558\n00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:10,603\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n559\n00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:12,880\n>> Right,so would it be this one here?\n\n560\n00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,220\nJust prevent installation removal devices?\n\n561\n00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,190\n>> And\nthat sounds like the other one, yep.\n\n562\n00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,100\n>> Now, this one right here, sorry,\nRonnie, this is a trick question.\n\n563\n00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,805\nIf we, if we turn this one on,\nthis will over ride that allow.\n\n564\n00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:25,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n565\n00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,720\n>> So this is a,\n>> Oh you need the last one.\n\n566\n00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,710\n>> The very last one.\n\n567\n00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:30,960\nAll right.\nPrevent\n\n568\n00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,398\ninstallation of device not\ndescribed by any other policy.\n\n569\n00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,560\nWe'll click enable,and so\n\n570\n00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,010\nin the options panel there we have\nnothing else really to, to put in.\n\n571\n00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,550\nAnd that, so there you go.\n\n572\n00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,740\nNow, perhaps if there is a device.\n\n573\n00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,130\n>> Mm hm.\n>> That we've been know to be problematic,\n\n574\n00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,780\nor if maybe things poorly made and\npeople lose there data all the time,\n\n575\n00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,665\nwell we just want to want\nwipe that one out completely.\n\n576\n00:25:52,665 --> 00:25:54,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So I don't have to have any you know,\n\n577\n00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,820\nsupport with it.\n\n578\n00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,035\nNow we can drop that one in here and\njust block a specific one.\n\n579\n00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And if we enable that one, and\n\n580\n00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,690\nthen just like the allow one,\nwe click in here, and\n\n581\n00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,250\ndrop in that you know, that device's\ndevice ID and lock it that way.\n\n582\n00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,870\nWe won't be, we won't use that right now.\n\n583\n00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,752\nAnd, all right so down there at, at\nthe bottom, so if we, if we prevented it.\n\n584\n00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:17,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n585\n00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,780\nThere's a check box down here,\n\n586\n00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:25,283\nalso applied to matching devices\nthat are all ready installed.\n\n587\n00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,780\nNow, a lot of stuff, if, if-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n588\n00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,620\n>> It's already installed,\n\n589\n00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,790\nif you've already used it before,\nthen sometimes the, the policy,\n\n590\n00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,140\nit will just kind of skip over it-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n591\n00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,290\n>> Since you're not adding any\nnew devices if it's already been\n\n592\n00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,937\nadded\n>> Yeah.\n\n593\n00:26:36,937 --> 00:26:41,195\n>> Then um,yeah, they sometimes they\ncan kind of skirt past this stuff.\n\n594\n00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:42,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n595\n00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,940\n>> So we can there's a check box there we\ncan also apply it to existing devices.\n\n596\n00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,960\n>> So if I already had used a existing\nUSB drive that was not that\n\n597\n00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,130\ndata traveller that we put in there and\nwe said it's sketchy,\n\n598\n00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,120\nwe don't like it, then if I put\nthat check mark what happens?\n\n599\n00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,510\n>> Oh, then wait what?\n\n600\n00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,930\nYeah, that'll just, it'll block it.\n\n601\n00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,570\n>> It'll block it now from this point on,\nright?\n\n602\n00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,950\n>> Yup, yeah.\nSorry, I was, I was reading ahead.\n\n603\n00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,252\n>> No, that's fine.\n\n604\n00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,210\n>> All right.\n\n605\n00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,420\nSo I'll just go ahead and\ncancel like that.\n\n606\n00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,960\nAnd all right.\n\n607\n00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,500\nYeah.\n\n608\n00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,230\nAnd there we go.\n\n609\n00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,270\n>> That's it?\n>> That's yeah.\n\n610\n00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,990\nShould be,\nthat should be all that we have, so, so\n\n611\n00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,360\nwe'll we'll take this device right\nhere and we will test it out.\n\n612\n00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n613\n00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:27,479\n>> Du, du, du, and we'll pop it right\nthere in our little device there.\n\n614\n00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,340\nA-ha.\n\n615\n00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,850\nSee?\n\n616\n00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,770\n>> Oh, look.\n\n617\n00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,110\n>> All right, it popped right up.\n\n618\n00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,320\nSo we'll go and safely eject this guy.\n\n619\n00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,550\nAnd with the policy here,\nlet me clear that out.\n\n620\n00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,320\nDa, da dum, mm-um.\n\n621\n00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,807\nIt's gonna refresh our policy [INAUDIBLE]\n>> There we go.\n\n622\n00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:54,047\n>> GP update [NOISE].\n\n623\n00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:58,040\nLet this guy, let this guy run,\nand then we'll try it again.\n\n624\n00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> And see what happens.\n\n625\n00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,030\n>> Yeah, remember that sometimes, policies\ntake a little bit of time to apply.\n\n626\n00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,130\nWhat we're doing here on\nthe command prompt remember,\n\n627\n00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,370\nis to tell it to actually go ahead and\napply the policy.\n\n628\n00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,080\nImmediately, and since we're forcing it,\nwe're not giving it any choice.\n\n629\n00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,750\n>> Mm, all right So, there we go.\n\n630\n00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,140\nWe'll take the early little test drive in.\n\n631\n00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:18,930\nPop that guy in.\n\n632\n00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,520\nRonnie, do you have any predictions?\n\n633\n00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,350\nAha.\n>> Oh, no.\n\n634\n00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,110\nWhat'd you do?\n\n635\n00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,440\n>> It popped right up.\n\n636\n00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,010\n>> Popped right up.\n\n637\n00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:27,880\nAll right.\n\n638\n00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,910\nAnd that is good, and\nwe have just the allow on du duh.\n\n639\n00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,030\n>> Oh no, what happened?\n\n640\n00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:40,452\n>> All right, so, let's go into [SOUND],\nturn that off and turn that off.\n\n641\n00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:46,450\nLet's go into Device Manager.\n\n642\n00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,460\n>> All right.\n\n643\n00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,080\n>> Let's remove that guy.\n\n644\n00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,662\n>> Okay.\n\n645\n00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:59,939\n[SOUND]\nAll right,\n\n646\n00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:01,450\nso we're going to uninstall that guy.\n\n647\n00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,500\nNow theoretically,\nwhen we connect this guy back in,\n\n648\n00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,720\nthen Windows will wanna go out and,\nand get the installation with this,\n\n649\n00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,340\nwhich should be prevented\nby our policy settings.\n\n650\n00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,440\n>> Okay.\n\n651\n00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,940\n>> All right, and\nnow we'll just pop that guy right back in.\n\n652\n00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,670\nHey, nothing yet?\n\n653\n00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,836\n>> Nothing yet.\n\n654\n00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:22,680\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n655\n00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,860\n>> Now, we do see a value.\n\n656\n00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,840\n>> There it is.\n>> So, it's under other devices, and\n\n657\n00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,770\nit's not plugged in.\n\n658\n00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,370\nIt's not not showing up.\n\n659\n00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,190\n>> There you go.\n\n660\n00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,825\n>> So, let's say, [INAUDIBLE] tech\nsurvey you know, employee here pops his,\n\n661\n00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,000\nhis drive in.\n\n662\n00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,700\nAnd now he's greeted with this, oh,\noh man, it's, it's not showing up.\n\n663\n00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,320\nSo he jumps over into a [INAUDIBLE] not\njumps over into device manager here.\n\n664\n00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,555\nSays, oh yeah, okay, it's, it,\nit's kind of recognized, right?\n\n665\n00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:48,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> He recognizes the 8 dat,\n\n666\n00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,760\nan 8 data drive which it is.\n\n667\n00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,250\nWe'll just update the driver software for\nit.\n\n668\n00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,650\nWe're gonna search automatically.\n\n669\n00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,840\nAs you go out and grind it and\nfind, try and find out.\n\n670\n00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,830\nSo there.\nThe installation of this device is\n\n671\n00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,645\nforbidden device.\n\n672\n00:30:01,645 --> 00:30:02,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's impossible.\n\n673\n00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,850\nContact your systems administrator\nright below that, Ronnie,\n\n674\n00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,860\nyou see what this is-\n>> Yup, I see it.\n\n675\n00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,460\nYup.\n\n676\n00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,130\n>> The he, this device is not allowed,\nyou go straight to jail.\n\n677\n00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,150\nThis is, is the only place I've seen our-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n678\n00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,090\n>> Custom messages appear.\n\n679\n00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,590\n>> Hm.\n\n680\n00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,860\n>> So, so, Ronnie, so how,\n\n681\n00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,340\nhow often do you think that somebody would\ngo through this and be able to see this?\n\n682\n00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,787\nIt's right here.\n>> Not easily.\n\n683\n00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:26,010\n[LAUGH] Yeah, not, not very often at all.\n\n684\n00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,900\n>> Nope.\nSo there we go.\n\n685\n00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,405\nSo now we've, we've blocked that drive.\n\n686\n00:30:29,405 --> 00:30:30,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n687\n00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,340\n>> And, let, let me pull this guy out.\n\n688\n00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,910\nAnd so we'll just make sure that our\napproved device is still approved.\n\n689\n00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,955\nAnd we're switching our USB.\n\n690\n00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:40,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n691\n00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,350\n>> To the one that we\nactually do have on our list.\n\n692\n00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:47,140\n>> I'm gonna slide it in a little bit,\ncuz last time, it didn't connect, or\n\n693\n00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,860\nsee it right away.\n\n694\n00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,780\n>> There it goes.\n\n695\n00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,635\nHey, look at that.\n>> There it goes.\n\n696\n00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:53,770\nAll right.\nSo there we have it.\n\n697\n00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,275\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n698\n00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:57,645\nnow we have blocked the other USB device.\n\n699\n00:30:57,645 --> 00:31:00,255\nAnd we have allowed our approved device.\n\n700\n00:31:00,255 --> 00:31:00,865\n>> Yeah.\n>> There we go.\n\n701\n00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,635\n>> So this shows very good\ncontrol of what we can\n\n702\n00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:05,500\nactually allow on our systems right now.\n\n703\n00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,580\nThe benefit of the policy right,\n\n704\n00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,820\neven though we're doing it on\nan individual computer means that we\n\n705\n00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,530\ncan also go up to the active directory\ngroup policy and also apply there.\n\n706\n00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,450\nAnd then that can then apply to whatever\ngroup we want to limit that to.\n\n707\n00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,130\nSo you might do it across your entire\norganization, or you might do it to\n\n708\n00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,642\na special security group that you\nhave instead, to be able to do this.\n\n709\n00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:26,152\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n710\n00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:28,975\n>> [INAUDIBLE] So\ntake a look at these policy settings.\n\n711\n00:31:28,975 --> 00:31:30,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n712\n00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,900\nSo Ronnie, so, so,\n\n713\n00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,970\nbased off what we just talked about-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n714\n00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:37,430\n>> Do you think that you will implement\nany of this at at your your place, or in\n\n715\n00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,590\nyour little group of friends to not allow\nthem bringing those, \"Yeah we see it.\n\n716\n00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,740\nOh yeah yeah yeah.\n\n717\n00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,370\nYeah that yeah that relative that\nbrought in a whole bunch of just\n\n718\n00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,050\ngames\n>> Yeah.\n\n719\n00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,120\n>> And stuff on USB drives,\nand stuck on your machine.\n\n720\n00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,140\nAre you going to now\nturn off your SB drives?\n\n721\n00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,845\n>> No.\nI just don't let them install games\n\n722\n00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:55,806\nanymore.\n\n723\n00:31:55,806 --> 00:31:58,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, at home, I better not do that.\n\n724\n00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,520\nThat would, that would be bad.\n\n725\n00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,850\nMy wife would probably\nnot appreciate that.\n\n726\n00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,450\n>> Wouldn't be a funny joke.\n>> No,\n\n727\n00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,219\nshe would not appreciate that, yeah.\n\n728\n00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:04,102\n>> It's, it's broke.\n\n729\n00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:05,774\n>> You know,\nshe would not appreciate that.\n\n730\n00:32:05,774 --> 00:32:06,680\n>> Buy a new laptop.\n\n731\n00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,096\nYep, sweet.\n\n732\n00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:13,770\n>> All right, Ronnie, well yeah, anything\nelse to put in on controlling access?\n\n733\n00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:18,800\n>> No, just remember, okay, at the 70-688,\n\n734\n00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,070\nyou are expected to be able to go\ninto the local group policy here.\n\n735\n00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,370\nSo take a look at those settings.\n\n736\n00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,820\n>> Understand what they are telling you.\n\n737\n00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,930\nRemember that a lot of times\nthey are used in conjunction.\n\n738\n00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:33,400\nSo, you know, sometimes you might set one,\ntake a look at all of\n\n739\n00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,010\nthem before you actually go into the exam\nso that you know where you're going to.\n\n740\n00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:40,540\nOne of the hardest things that I\nhave in terms of doing group policy,\n\n741\n00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,300\nis really about navigating around.\n\n742\n00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,800\nSo the more often you're taking a look\nat this, especially for the 688 exam,\n\n743\n00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,020\nthe better off you're gonna be.\n\n744\n00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,510\nOkay, so do remember that a lot of times\nit's not just one setting, it's multiple\n\n745\n00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:56,190\nsettings that really are actually what\ngives you the combination that you need.\n\n746\n00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,700\n>> Mm.\n>> And, you know what Ronnie,\n\n747\n00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,930\nnow it, the precursor to what, you know,\nwhat we'll be discussing not, not here but\n\n748\n00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,735\na little bit later.\n\n749\n00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:04,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As well as on my mind and\n\n750\n00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,790\nI guess it does kind of fall into\ncontrolling you know, device access\n\n751\n00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:14,040\na little bit but yeah back over here\nin the in our local group policy here,\n\n752\n00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,750\nand I don't mean to jump\n>> No that's fine\n\n753\n00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,370\n>> Back up in there but\n\n754\n00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,040\ndone in Windows components, and\n\n755\n00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,540\nin BitLocker drive encryption\n>> Oh, yep\n\n756\n00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,230\n>> There's a spot down here with removable\n\n757\n00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,280\ndata drives.\n\n758\n00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,260\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n759\n00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,450\n>> And in here, we can control these,\n\n760\n00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,150\nthese devices-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n761\n00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:36,450\n>> And, and whether or not you know,\nthey have to be encrypted and yeah.\n\n762\n00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,230\nShoot, those sorts of things,\nso, you know, and\n\n763\n00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,290\nforce drive encryption\ntype on removal drives.\n\n764\n00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,670\nAnd this one up here.\n\n765\n00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,970\nDeny write access to removable drive\nis not protected by, by BitLocker.\n\n766\n00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,200\nSo you know, perhaps yeah, if do want\npeople to be able use this company issue\n\n767\n00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,960\ndrive, maybe we want everybody to\nuse BitLocker to, to put on there.\n\n768\n00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,910\n>> And let's just say, you know,\n\n769\n00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,485\nwe, we did want to now to\nBitLocker this little drive here.\n\n770\n00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:09,050\nCuz you know, we'll we'll cover\nBitLocker in depth later.\n\n771\n00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,578\nBut it's just little right click,\nturn on BitLocker, that little guy.\n\n772\n00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:18,940\nAnd it's gonna analyze it and\ngive us an option to turn this guy on,\n\n773\n00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,240\nso we say oh yeah, let's, you know,\nuse a, a password, and A S D F,\n\n774\n00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,820\nand A S D F and click on Next and ha!\n\n775\n00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,740\nOh, oh they're saying, man I can't\nbelieve you're trying to do that.\n\n776\n00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,466\nNow, okay, well I guess we're-\n>> Yeah, short password.\n\n777\n00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,044\n>> Length, length requirements.\n\n778\n00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:36,210\n>> That' right.\n>> But you know but but\n\n779\n00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,390\nyeah we can go through that and\nyeah log these devices down.\n\n780\n00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,800\n>> Yeah, control it,\nyeah with BitLocker as well.\n\n781\n00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,010\n>> Yeah, sounds good.\n\n782\n00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,972\n>> Sweet.\n\n783\n00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:48,870\nAll right well that that's all I've got\nto, for controlling device access and.\n\n784\n00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,270\n>> Yep.\n>> Anything else Ronnie?\n\n785\n00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,850\n>> Nope.\nRemember,\n\n786\n00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,130\nstudying is the key,\ngetting into the operating system.\n\n787\n00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,410\nDon't just think that you can,\ncan know this just by reading about it.\n\n788\n00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,210\nYou've got to get in there,\n\n789\n00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,110\nyou've got to manually manipulate and\nknow how to actually do this stuff.\n\n790\n00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,590\nThe key, remember, behind the,\nthe group policy sentence, okay?\n\n791\n00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,390\nMultiple policies do apply.\n\n792\n00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,820\nRead whatever requirement they give you.\n\n793\n00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,270\nMake sure that it actually answers all\nof the requirements before you go,\n\n794\n00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,630\nokay, I'm just gonna turn this one on.\n\n795\n00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,435\nSo, make sure you do that.\n\n796\n00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:16,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n797\n00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,970\nSweet.\n\n798\n00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,770\nAll right, well, if you ever have any\nquestions for us

00:00:37,566\nAlright, welcome back to our\nfantastic episode of IT Pro tv.\n\n5\n00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:41,740\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,670\n>> How's it going Nate?\n\n7\n00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,340\n>> Pretty good Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:43,890\n>> Yes?\n\n9\n00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Had a good, good good day so far?\n\n10\n00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,990\n>> Pumped up ready to go?\n\n11\n00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,970\n>> It's pretty good.\n\n12\n00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,400\n>> That sounds good to me.\n\n13\n00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:50,950\n>> You?\n\n14\n00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,830\n>> Yes, doing well.\n\n15\n00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,690\n>> Okay.\n\n16\n00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,360\n>> Yes.\n\n17\n00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,770\n>> Okay, did you,\ndid you beat your high score?\n\n18\n00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,250\nI did not beat my high score.\n\n19\n00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,880\nMy free cell score is still six and.\n\n20\n00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,620\n>> Is that, is that good?\n\n21\n00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,380\n>> No.\n>> Oh.\n\n22\n00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,500\n>> It's terrible.\n\n23\n00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,330\n>> I don't, which one is free cell?\n\n24\n00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,700\n>> It's the one with cards.\n\n25\n00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,635\nRight,\n>> Yeah, I, I play it old fashioned way.\n\n26\n00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:10,885\nYou don't actually use a computer and.\n\n27\n00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:12,995\n>> Li, like real cards.\n\n28\n00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:14,115\n>> Yeah, like real cards.\n\n29\n00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,045\n>> And you'd shuffle them all out.\n\n30\n00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:16,145\n>> That's it.\n\n31\n00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:18,785\n>> Huh, man, right on, well that's cool.\n\n32\n00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:19,735\n>> Analog system.\n\n33\n00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:21,255\n>> And it does what.\n\n34\n00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:22,490\n>> Analog systems.\n\n35\n00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,300\nAnalog systems.\n\n36\n00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,010\n>> That's right.\n\n37\n00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,845\n>> Yep, well speaking of analog systems,\nwe have data storage.\n\n38\n00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:32,900\n[LAUGH] So today, on our objectives\nthat we'll be covering today is\n\n39\n00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:39,550\nthe 688 objectives, and the official\nobjective da da da as I pull this up.\n\n40\n00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,540\nThis, official objective we're\ngetting down in here to 2.4,\n\n41\n00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,460\nsupport data storage and\nspecifically about data storage.\n\n42\n00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,870\nWe have storage spaces.\n\n43\n00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,480\n>> Right.\n>> And why we would use those.\n\n44\n00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,800\nAnd we'll, go through and we'll set up\na quick little storage space pool and\n\n45\n00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,655\nwe'll be discussing branch.\n\n46\n00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:04,140\nCashe, and how a branch cashe would\nplay a part in data storage, and\n\n47\n00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,300\nwe'll go through the steps on how\nto set up the client for that.\n\n48\n00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,570\nAnd, then with good old DFS, distributed-\n>> Yup.\n\n49\n00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,580\n>> File system, that one's re,\npretty cool, we'll touch on that.\n\n50\n00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,270\nAnd, last, Skydrive.\n\n51\n00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,500\n>> Yeah, send up a little bit-\n>> Hm.\n\n52\n00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,580\n>> Skydrive,\ntalk about the the issue around that.\n\n53\n00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,010\nWell for us, now.\n\n54\n00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,460\nNow, for us here in terms of\nsupporting data storage, right.\n\n55\n00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,290\nYou as a, a desktop support technician,\n\n56\n00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,390\nneed to know what's available to you and\nknow the issues are surrounding those.\n\n57\n00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,120\nSo, a lot of times there\nare different reasons why you would\n\n58\n00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,250\nuse the technology that you have.\n\n59\n00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,590\nYou want to make sure that you\ncan identify these issues today.\n\n60\n00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,990\nSo for us, one of the key issues\nthat we can actually begin with,\n\n61\n00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,080\nis the local storage on our computers.\n\n62\n00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,330\nNow, a lot of times when youre working\nwith devices like laptops, right.\n\n63\n00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,750\nYou tend to buy one but\n\n64\n00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,720\nyou dont tend to upgrade laptops\nvery often, okay, if at all.\n\n65\n00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,940\nFor example, on my laptop that I have\nin front of me, I don't even know if I\n\n66\n00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,760\ncan actually really upgrade that\nparticular laptop at all, it's a,\n\n67\n00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,190\na 12 inch laptop that's super thin,\nand it has a 250 gig hard drive in it.\n\n68\n00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,520\nAnd there may be a chance that I\ncould upgrade it but I may not.\n\n69\n00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,720\nSo what are some ways that\nI might actually choose\n\n70\n00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,380\nto be able to increase my storage space.\n\n71\n00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,340\nLet's say even on this\nparticular computer here.\n\n72\n00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,160\nOkay?\nSo we want\n\n73\n00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,575\nto talk about this idea of storage\nspaces and with 8.1 what it can do.\n\n74\n00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n75\n00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,860\nYeah I guess you just put in a,\nthumb drive in the side.\n\n76\n00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,500\n>> Yeah that would do it.\n\n77\n00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,810\n>> And\nyou could increase your storage that way.\n\n78\n00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,614\n>> Yeah, but\nwhat if I actually use more than that?\n\n79\n00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:31,180\nWhat, what can I do?\n\n80\n00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520\n>> You could use sky drive.\n\n81\n00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,780\n>> I could possibly use sky drive.\n\n82\n00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,620\nYup.\n\n83\n00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,280\nWell, the idea here is behind actually\ntaking a look at this technologies that we\n\n84\n00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,570\ncall storage spaces.\n\n85\n00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,480\nRight?\n\n86\n00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,710\n>> Huh, yup.\n\n87\n00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,487\nNow with a, with storage spaces.\n\n88\n00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:47,310\n>> Right.\n\n89\n00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,695\n>> Storage spacious will allow us to\ntake a, a collection of hard drives.\n\n90\n00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Let's say we you know, and\n\n91\n00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,520\nit doesn't matter what interface.\n\n92\n00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,180\nSo, they can be IDE drives,\nthey can be SATA drives, SAS drives.\n\n93\n00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,890\nAny kind of drive.\n\n94\n00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,700\nThey can be internal drives,\nexternal drives.\n\n95\n00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,590\nThumb drives.\n\n96\n00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,360\n>> Yeah.\n\n97\n00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,580\n>> Any kind of drive.\n\n98\n00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,055\nAnd we can grab all these drives together\nand make a, I guess, one logical drive.\n\n99\n00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:13,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or a pool of all these drives.\n\n100\n00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,480\n>> Yup.\n>> And then from that pool,\n\n101\n00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,710\nwe can then slice off different\nvolumes to use for different things.\n\n102\n00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,370\nYeah.\n\n103\n00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,490\n>> Now, as we slice off those volumes,\nor, or, as I should say, as the,\n\n104\n00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,670\nthe pool is created, there's different\nI guess different ways we can create.\n\n105\n00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,395\nWe can create stuff where\nwe just get performance.\n\n106\n00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:34,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or we can create stuff to give us\n\n107\n00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,785\nfault tolerance.\n\n108\n00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:35,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n109\n00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n110\n00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,060\n>> And so for us here,\nwe need to know the,\n\n111\n00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,720\nthe idea here\n>> Right, that storage space\n\n112\n00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,880\nis available to us and that it can\nreally include all types of drives.\n\n113\n00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,190\nAnd unlike some of the other types of\nthings that we might consider like\n\n114\n00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,970\nRaid and.\n\n115\n00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,800\nand Raid 5 and stuff.\n\n116\n00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,810\nUsually those drives have\nto be the exact same size.\n\n117\n00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,720\nWhat we're talking about in storage pools,\nthey really don't.\n\n118\n00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,390\nThey can be any size drives, and we can\nactually use the capacity of those drives\n\n119\n00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,000\nto actually create the storage\npool that we're talking about.\n\n120\n00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,990\nAnd you can do it inside\nWindows 8.1 very easily.\n\n121\n00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,590\nOkay?\n\n122\n00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,300\n>> Yep, good.\n\n123\n00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,100\nNow there's, there's three types,\nthere's three types of, of pools, or\n\n124\n00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,490\nstorage spaces that we can make, right.\n\n125\n00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,310\nThere's the, the simple SimpleSpace.\n\n126\n00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,715\nSimpleSpace, right, you get a bit of\nperformance increase out of that.\n\n127\n00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:25,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But you don't any fall tolerance.\n\n128\n00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,440\n>> Huh.\n>> If one of those drives fails\n\n129\n00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,480\nin a SimpleSpace, you lose it.\n\n130\n00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,730\nYou lose everything.\n\n131\n00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,530\n>> That's it.\n\n132\n00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,655\n>> So not I mean you know,\ngood for performance.\n\n133\n00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:34,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But ya, for\n\n134\n00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,400\nheavens sake you lose one drive.\n\n135\n00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,250\nNow you know what.\n\n136\n00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,075\nBefore we get into it.\n\n137\n00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:38,760\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n138\n00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,195\n>> Ronnie, how many hard drives\nthroughout your many years of computing.\n\n139\n00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:46,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How many hard drives have you had fail?\n\n140\n00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,780\n>> Just about all of them.\n\n141\n00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,460\n>> Oh, no way.\n\n142\n00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,540\n>> Just about all of them, yeah,\nafter a period of time, yeah.\n\n143\n00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,340\nWow, yeah, goodness I think,\nman, I don't know.\n\n144\n00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,020\nMaybe just one or two drives.\n\n145\n00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,640\nI mean\n>> No.\n\n146\n00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,610\n>> not that often. I mean you get.\n\n147\n00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,300\n>> No, I'm, I'm a, I'm a\n>> Right?\n\n148\n00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,220\n>> bit harder on hard drives\n\n149\n00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,972\nthan you are, apparently.\n\n150\n00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:01,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,830\n>> Do you, I mean,\n\n152\n00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,860\nyou just put them in your computer and\nyou write stuff to it and then it works.\n\n153\n00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,730\nWhat, what.\n>> Yeah.\n\n154\n00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,020\n>> What else are you\ndoing to your machines?\n\n155\n00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,970\n>> Yeah,\nI'm running virtual machines on mine.\n\n156\n00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,510\nConstantly.\n\n157\n00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,290\n>> Oh, man.\n\n158\n00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, okay.\n\n159\n00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,990\nWell, I guess, poor, poor example.\n\n160\n00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But but\n\n161\n00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,940\n>> Just pick all of them, yeah.\n\n162\n00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,200\n>> Yeah, you know a hard drive,\nyeah, you know, for me,\n\n163\n00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,100\nI know hard drives they\ndon't fail that often.\n\n164\n00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,890\nBut but whe, when they do,\nyou know, the off chance\n\n165\n00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,160\nthat they do if you don't catch it-\n>> Yeah.\n\n166\n00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,730\n>> You know, the hard, if they,\nthey click, or you start getting errors\n\n167\n00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,280\non it, you know, you\n>> Swap that drive out before you start\n\n168\n00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,930\ngetting, you know, completely crashes.\n\n169\n00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,090\nBut, but yeah, you know, they do fail.\n\n170\n00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,960\nThey do happen and, you know,\nlosing data, I mean, horrible.\n\n171\n00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,696\n>> Yeah, pretty hefty.\n\n172\n00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:42,853\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n173\n00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:47,110\n>> And, don't, don't, in terms of what,\nwhat Nate's talking about Rob.\n\n174\n00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,200\nI've only had like four computers or\nfive computers over the last 20 years.\n\n175\n00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,612\nSo, [LAUGH] so it's not like\nits 45 hard drives here Nate.\n\n176\n00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:58,320\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, [LAUGH] so what like four or\n\n177\n00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,080\nfive hard drives?\n\n178\n00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,260\nYeah [LAUGH].\n>> Through 20 years?\n\n179\n00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,880\nMan!\n\n180\n00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,820\n>> I know [LAUGH].\n\n181\n00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,400\n>> Ronnie, wow.\n\n182\n00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,040\nOkay.\n\n183\n00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,330\nAll right.\nYeah, yeah.\n\n184\n00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,950\n>> For example.\n>> But, so yes.\n\n185\n00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,060\nHard drives you fail.\n\n186\n00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,420\n>> Yes.\n>> Now, there's a, so yeah,\n\n187\n00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,920\nso there's the simple space.\n\n188\n00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,200\nNow, the other space that we have.\n\n189\n00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,930\nRight?\n>> It's called mirror.\n\n190\n00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,480\n>> Yeah.\nMirror drives are mirrored spaces for\n\n191\n00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,320\nus, allow us to, to be able to\ncreate duplicate copies, right?\n\n192\n00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,240\nWe can actually mirror one drive,\nwhatever's written to one,\n\n193\n00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,740\nthe other side is also written to as well.\n\n194\n00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,520\nAnd for this one, we actually need\na minimum of, how many is it?\n\n195\n00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600\nThree?\n>> Two drives.\n\n196\n00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,390\n>> Two.\n\n197\n00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,760\nActually do the mirror.\n\n198\n00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,470\nYup.\nTwo drives to make a mirror and\n\n199\n00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,726\nthat will survive one disk failure.\n\n200\n00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:39,560\n>> Yup.\n>> One disk failure.\n\n201\n00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,030\nNow, if we want to do a three way.\n\n202\n00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,875\nSo, that's a two way mirror.\n\n203\n00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,880\n>> Mm-hm.\nIf we want to do a three way mirror,\n\n204\n00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,500\nthen we need five drives, and a three way\nmirror can suffer two drives failing.\n\n205\n00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,340\nSo that's for a three way mirror.\n\n206\n00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,090\n>> Yeah, so this is a little bit\nconfusing in terms of the math here.\n\n207\n00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,267\nBut, the minimum numbers is actually\nthe key here, and the good thing is,\n\n208\n00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:04,597\ninside a storage space it will tell you,\nIf you choose to create a three-way,\n\n209\n00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,830\nyou're gonna need a minimum of so\nmany drives here.\n\n210\n00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,720\nSo these are the defaults that\nwe'll actually end up seeing here.\n\n211\n00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,435\nSo to you, it,\n\n212\n00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:14,210\nit's not that we're trying to do some\nfancy math to make this work here.\n\n213\n00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,520\nIt's exactly what Windows 8.1 is\ntelling us what needs to be there,\n\n214\n00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,498\n'kay, is what we have.\n\n215\n00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,550\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right.\n\n216\n00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,370\nAnd, so for the, the third type\nof space is the parity spaces.\n\n217\n00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,086\nParity spaces it's it's,\nit's like, like a mirror.\n\n218\n00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:27,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right.\n\n219\n00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,225\nAnd it writes the, the,\nthe, the parity bit, right?\n\n220\n00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:33,072\nSo you know if you have a drive fail\nthat uses parity bit to, kind of,\n\n221\n00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:34,810\nrebuild the structure there.\n\n222\n00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:39,013\nAnd to create a parity space,\nyou need at least three drives and\n\n223\n00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:41,720\nthis will withstand one drive failure.\n\n224\n00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,026\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now you can have more drives than that,\n\n225\n00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:49,892\nso if you want to build a selfer from\ntwo failed drives then you need at least\n\n226\n00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:50,929\nseven drives.\n\n227\n00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,351\n>> Yeah.\n>> A pool of seven drives in a parity\n\n228\n00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:56,220\nspace withstands two disc failures.\n\n229\n00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,463\n>> Yeah.\nNow if you compare this\n\n230\n00:08:57,463 --> 00:09:01,297\nto things like what you already know from,\nfrom earlier studies like using the,\n\n231\n00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:04,110\nthe redundant array of independent disk,\nright?\n\n232\n00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,520\nUsually that helps you to recover\nfrom the failure of only one drive.\n\n233\n00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,350\n'Kay?\n\n234\n00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,500\nSo, in, in terms of mirror,\nyou actually have two drives.\n\n235\n00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,990\nAgain, you can actually only\nrecover one of those failures here.\n\n236\n00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,450\nEven if you do RAID, regardless of\nhow many disks you actually have,\n\n237\n00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,510\nit really can only help you recover\nfrom the, the failure of only one drive.\n\n238\n00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,240\n'Kay?\n\n239\n00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,940\nHere in terms of storage spaces,\n\n240\n00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,385\nthey're saying that they can actually\ndo those types of things, but better.\n\n241\n00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:34,020\n'Kay, now I don't think we actually still\nget the hardware performance level that we\n\n242\n00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,760\nwould get out of actually using\nsomething like, like a RAID array.\n\n243\n00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,566\nBut what it does give us though, is the\nadvantage of doing things like a three-way\n\n244\n00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:45,250\nmirror, or the idea of actually multiple\ndrive failures or, or at least two drive\n\n245\n00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,790\nfailures, in terms of that that, that\nlast one that we just talked about here.\n\n246\n00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,350\nWhich we called, what did we call it?\n\n247\n00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,240\nParity spaces.\n\n248\n00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,010\n'Kay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n249\n00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,500\n>> Is what we actually have here.\n\n250\n00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,590\n>> Yeah.\n[COUGH] Now in the event that there is a,\n\n251\n00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,890\na disk failure, you know, replacing\nthat disk is just as easy as, you know,\n\n252\n00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,520\npulling out the failed,\npopping in the new disk, and\n\n253\n00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,445\nthe storage spaces will\nbegin to rebuild that pool.\n\n254\n00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:10,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And save all your data together.\n\n255\n00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,320\nNow, and\nthe now using storage spaces in win,\n\n256\n00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,200\nWindows servers-\n>> Mm-Hm.\n\n257\n00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,500\n>> It's not on, on the client,\nbut in the server.\n\n258\n00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,965\nYou're gonna have hot spares.\n\n259\n00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:19,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Hot spares are put in there so\n\n260\n00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,260\nin, in the event of there is\na disk failure, then, you know,\n\n261\n00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,150\nthat, that disk that's just kinda sitting\nthere of to the side, not being used.\n\n262\n00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,200\nIt's just waiting in queue.\n\n263\n00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,180\nThen we know Windows can then\npull that disk into the pool and\n\n264\n00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,175\nrebuild that structure.\n\n265\n00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:32,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n266\n00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,900\n>> You know, in case you have another.\n\n267\n00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,820\nFailed disc before you can swap that,\nthat failed one out.\n\n268\n00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,110\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty sweet stuff.\n\n269\n00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,808\nYou know, there's,\nI guess more, more new stuff.\n\n270\n00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,110\nI'd, I'm a big fan of storage spaces.\n\n271\n00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,660\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'd, I like it.\n\n272\n00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,400\n>> Yeah, so, so this gives you that,\nthat need ability, right,\n\n273\n00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,615\nto be able to have multiple discs that\nmaybe you're not really using right now,\n\n274\n00:10:52,615 --> 00:10:55,300\ncuz you've just upgraded a computer,\nbut you still wanna include it in.\n\n275\n00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,200\nBecause the hard drive size is actually\nappropriate for us and we can do that.\n\n276\n00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,340\nSo, Nate, what's a better\nopportunity than right now for\n\n277\n00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,865\nus to actually create some storage spaces?\n\n278\n00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,570\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll Right.\n\n279\n00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,570\nYeah.\nSure.\n\n280\n00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,960\nAll right, so on here I do have, let's\nsee, a little virtual machine right here.\n\n281\n00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:19,140\nAnd on this virtual machine there are four\nhard drives, just kind of hanging out.\n\n282\n00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,470\nSo that we'll just go over there and\ntake a quick peek at those drives.\n\n283\n00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,910\nAnd end disk management.\n\n284\n00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,790\nSo there you go, so you got disk one, two,\n\n285\n00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,713\nthree and four they're all\n127 gigabytes hard drives.\n\n286\n00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:34,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n287\n00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,099\n>> And they are un-allocated and\njust hanging out.\n\n288\n00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:38,834\nSo to, oh were you going to say something,\nRonnie?\n\n289\n00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:39,454\n>> Nope.\n>> Oh my bad.\n\n290\n00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:42,032\nAll right, so, so\nwe create that storage space, right?\n\n291\n00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:45,719\nWe'll just go to storage, storage spaces.\n\n292\n00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:50,821\nAnd, you know, in, I mean, this total\nthing is just wizard, wizard-driven.\n\n293\n00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:51,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n294\n00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,960\n>> So pretty fancy.\n\n295\n00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,700\nSo Manage Storage Spaces,\nlet's just create a, a new pool.\n\n296\n00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,870\nAnd that would be the first step.\n\n297\n00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,790\nWe'll agree to that.\n\n298\n00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,721\nAnd now we need to pick which drives\nthat we want to include in our pool.\n\n299\n00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,114\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So if we have you know, all four,\n\n300\n00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:10,333\nthree, two you know,\nit would depend on which type of,\n\n301\n00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,011\nyou know,\nstorage pool we're wanting to set up.\n\n302\n00:12:13,011 --> 00:12:15,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If it's just a, a mirror, right?\n\n303\n00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,370\nYou know, maybe just two drives.\n\n304\n00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,890\nIf we want to set up a parity space,\nwe need at least three of those drives.\n\n305\n00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,770\nSo nothing really, really for four, so\nlet's just take one of those drives off.\n\n306\n00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,927\nAnd we will create a pool\nwith those three drives.\n\n307\n00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,235\nAnd we'll prep those drives,\nget those guys ready.\n\n308\n00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:40,623\nSo what do you think, Ronnie?\n\n309\n00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:42,965\nSo with three drives,\nwhat what shall we set up?\n\n310\n00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,290\nParity space?\n\n311\n00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,099\nTwo way mirror?\n\n312\n00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,911\n>> Yeah.\nLet's go ahead and do that, might as well,\n\n313\n00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:48,876\nand we actually have the ability to do so,\nsure.\n\n314\n00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:49,920\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right.\n\n315\n00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,058\nSo for the name of our storage space,\n\n316\n00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:55,741\nwe'll just accept the default\nStorage Space, drive letter e is fine.\n\n317\n00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n318\n00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,460\n>> File system NTFS.\n\n319\n00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,260\nNow we have the option to do the REFS,\nright?\n\n320\n00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,430\nOr the Resiliency File System.\n\n321\n00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,020\n>> Right.\n>> Now,\n\n322\n00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:09,910\nthe resiliency file system,\nit it's on, on the back end, you know.\n\n323\n00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,869\nIt it protects the, the data integrity.\n\n324\n00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:13,369\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n325\n00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:15,876\nIt just helps kind of keep things a little\n\n326\n00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,902\nbit better in the,\nin the event of a disk failure.\n\n327\n00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:21,021\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But we will just choose NTFS for\n\n328\n00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:22,025\nour types here.\n\n329\n00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,490\nAnd let's choose a parity.\n\n330\n00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,586\n>> Now notice that little\ninformation box there.\n\n331\n00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:31,746\nRight?\nRemember I told you that it,\n\n332\n00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:34,567\nit's not that, that we're trying to\nmake up some type of weird math of,\n\n333\n00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,814\nhow many drives we actually\nneed to create this, right?\n\n334\n00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:40,762\nInside that little box it tells us\nthat the parity storage that we have\n\n335\n00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:44,775\nrequires at least three drives here,\nfor one failure we actually do more,\n\n336\n00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:47,980\nwe're gonna have to actually\nhave more than that, 'kay?\n\n337\n00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,157\nBut that's the,\nwhere we're actually getting it from.\n\n338\n00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,289\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n339\n00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,177\nYup.\n\n340\n00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:53,935\nYeah, yeah, no doubt.\n\n341\n00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:57,795\nYeah, three-way mirror and it tells us\nright there you need at least five drives.\n\n342\n00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,015\n>> Do we have five?\n\n343\n00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,095\n>> No, we just have four.\n\n344\n00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:01,785\n>> Then we're probably not\ngoing to be able to do it.\n\n345\n00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:02,285\n[LAUGH]\n>> Nope.\n\n346\n00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,145\nI wonder what it would say.\n\n347\n00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,710\nIt did give me the, the option there.\n\n348\n00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,090\nOkay nevermind.\n\n349\n00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,970\nYeah.\nSo\n\n350\n00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,080\nit's all grayed out I didn't look ahead.\n\n351\n00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,040\nAll right, parity space.\n\n352\n00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,760\n>> Yep.\n\n353\n00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,620\n>> There we go.\n\n354\n00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,205\nAll right, so, now at this point\nwe can set the maximum size\n\n355\n00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:19,740\nthat we want to use over pool\ninto this storage space here.\n\n356\n00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And we will just use the maximum size.\n\n357\n00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,139\nNow the total pool\ncapacity is 375 gigabytes.\n\n358\n00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:27,778\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n359\n00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:31,400\n>> But\nthe size down there is 251gigabytes.\n\n360\n00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,580\nSo, Ronnie, why is our, our space gonna be\nsmaller than our total capacity of drives?\n\n361\n00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,160\n>> Formatting?\n\n362\n00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,430\n>> Formatting?\n\n363\n00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,130\n>> Formatting.\n\n364\n00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,800\n>> Right.\n\n365\n00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,670\nParity space?\n\n366\n00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,305\n>> Parity space.\n\n367\n00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:44,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n368\n00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,690\nYep.\nSo we won't,\n\n369\n00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,370\nwe know we wont be able to use\nthe entire amount of that space there.\n\n370\n00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,590\n>> There you go.\n>> Some some space will be required for\n\n371\n00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,810\nthat parity-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n372\n00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,810\n>> To rebuild the simulator.\n\n373\n00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,335\n>> Right.\n\n374\n00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:56,440\nRebuild that stuff, so, and that is it.\n\n375\n00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,370\n>> Yeah.\nNow, before you click next, right,\n\n376\n00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,420\ntake a look at information\nbox again down at the bottom.\n\n377\n00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,950\nStorage spaces can be larger\nthan the amount of a,\n\n378\n00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,285\navailable capacity on the storage pool,\n'kay?\n\n379\n00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,260\nWhat in the world is that about?\n\n380\n00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,810\n>> Right, what oh, you mean like thin and\nthick, or [CROSSTALK].\n\n381\n00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,366\n>> No, well, I mean that, yeah.\n\n382\n00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:15,000\nYeah-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n383\n00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,245\n>> If you actually take a look at that,\nright?\n\n384\n00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:17,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's saying that you can actually\n\n385\n00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,930\nmake it bigger if you choose to,\n'kay, than what's actually there.\n\n386\n00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,770\nAnd notice what it says,\n\n387\n00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,630\nit says here, it's because you\nhave the ability to do what?\n\n388\n00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,440\nEven if you create it now,\n\n389\n00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,510\nyou can add in more that will later\nactually expand that volume out.\n\n390\n00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,450\nSo if you, even though you\nchoose to actually make it,\n\n391\n00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,120\nthis large size right now,\nin the future can be expanded out more, so\n\n392\n00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,105\nyou could actually even create\na larger size if you wanted to.\n\n393\n00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n394\n00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,100\nShould, should we do it?\n\n395\n00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,660\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,600\n>> Cuz you're not adding anything anymore.\n\n397\n00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,730\n>> All right.\n\n398\n00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,490\n>> Yup.\n>> So there you go, so\n\n399\n00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,740\nwe'll just create that storage space.\n\n400\n00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,260\nAnd that is just about it.\n\n401\n00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> As far as creating a storage space.\n\n402\n00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,615\n>> Yeah.\nNow what should actually appear, though,\n\n403\n00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:54,502\nis when we get back into File Explorer,\n\n404\n00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:57,474\nwe'll just see a simple\nhard drive actually appear.\n\n405\n00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:58,340\nInstead.\n\n406\n00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,142\nNow the key that we actually had in\nthe very beginning when we actually went\n\n407\n00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:06,473\ninto the disk manager here\nis that Nate added in\n\n408\n00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:11,070\nhard drives that were called\nunallocated space, okay.\n\n409\n00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,760\nThat means that those drives haven't\nbeen assigned any formatting or\n\n410\n00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,790\nany drive letters at all on that\nparticular drive at this point.\n\n411\n00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,380\nSo, for\n\n412\n00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,986\nus here what happens if we actually\ndo something with a formatted drive.\n\n413\n00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:25,440\nKay.\nYou're probably\n\n414\n00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,110\ngoing to see that storage space and go I\ndon't really like to use these things.\n\n415\n00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,095\nIs what we have.\n\n416\n00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:31,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n417\n00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,100\nAlright, so here we go.\n\n418\n00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,980\nSo in our little overview here,\nfor our storage pool.\n\n419\n00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,940\nYou can up there that\neverything is healthy, right.\n\n420\n00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,240\nWe've got green lights everywhere.\n\n421\n00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,140\nWe can click down here on\nthe physical drives so\n\n422\n00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:50,380\nwe can see which drives are in our pool,\nand yeah, that's just about it.\n\n423\n00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,970\nSo we can jump back over\ninto the file explorer,\n\n424\n00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,830\nand as far as Windows is concerned\nit's just a single drive.\n\n425\n00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> A single hard drive that we can\n\n426\n00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,400\nwrite to, and create files,\nand do things on.\n\n427\n00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,720\n>> There you go.\n>> [INAUDIBLE] just create a file.\n\n428\n00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,090\nThere we go, sdf.\n\n429\n00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,093\nMm-hm.\n\n430\n00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:14,410\nAll right, there is our storage space.\n\n431\n00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,260\n>> Yeah.\n\n432\n00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,320\nNow, the other things of course, is what\nif you actually choose to change this up.\n\n433\n00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,200\n'Kay?\n\n434\n00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,640\nSo, once again notice that there are\ndifferent options over here on the right\n\n435\n00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,080\nhand side of some of\nthe things you can do such as\n\n436\n00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,670\nchanging the the adding drives here,\nor renaming the pool.\n\n437\n00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,970\nAnd, for us here you can,\nI think we can also change the actual\n\n438\n00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,910\nstorage space size under storage spaces if\nyou click on that link that says change.\n\n439\n00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,990\nOkay, so notice if you need to modify\nthis in terms of, hey I don't this entire\n\n440\n00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,660\nsize here, we change it down to whatever\nsize we want to, let's say 151 instead.\n\n441\n00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,980\nNope, doesn't like that size.\n\n442\n00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,400\nI wonder why that, oh, I don't know.\n\n443\n00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,430\n>> Guess we can go bigger, or not?\n\n444\n00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,635\n>> Go bigger, not smaller, yep.\n\n445\n00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:03,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You wanna change it?\n\n446\n00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,305\n>> Yeah, change it.\nThere you go.\n\n447\n00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:08,380\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, yeah.\n\n448\n00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,210\n>> Hm.\n>> So now it's gonna it's gonna\n\n449\n00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,810\nexpect you, at some point, even though,\n\n450\n00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:15,868\nyou're not using all the space, it can go\nto a maximum, at this point, of 500 gigs.\n\n451\n00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n452\n00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,157\n>> Yup.\n\n453\n00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:22,600\n>> All right, so, now, and, in what\nkind of situations would, all right so,\n\n454\n00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,360\nwe're really going over, like, like,\nthree different technologies on,\n\n455\n00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,775\nwell maybe four technologies to,\nfor our data storage.\n\n456\n00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n457\n00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,530\n>> So we've got these, the storage spaces.\n\n458\n00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,460\nNow, and what, what kind of\nscenarios would you choose this?\n\n459\n00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,280\nEh, we, I guess we haven't\n\n460\n00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,990\nreally talked about-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n461\n00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,060\n>> Branch cache-\n>> Yup.\n\n462\n00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,390\n>> Or EDFS, or Skydrive.\n\n463\n00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:39,970\n>> Right.\n\n464\n00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,835\n>> But you know, so, you know, what kind\nof situations would we prefer storage\n\n465\n00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:46,850\nspaces over, you know, other kinds.\n\n466\n00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n467\n00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,520\nWell, in this particular situation, right,\n\n468\n00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,700\nwhere we're not really relying on network\ndrives to access here, we're relying on\n\n469\n00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,560\nthe individual computer, this gives me\nthe ability to add in a couple of USB\n\n470\n00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,030\ndrives that I may not be currently using,\nto go ahead and be able to do that.\n\n471\n00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,550\nOr if I have extra drive bays,\nI may be able to do that, but\n\n472\n00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,190\nI don't want to actually write\nto six different drives, right?\n\n473\n00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,880\nThen I can combine that entire mass,\nor the entire capacity of those drives\n\n474\n00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,070\ntogether, and\nit should report as one drive here.\n\n475\n00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,290\nAnd then later on if I choose to\nupgrade an older drive, pull one out,\n\n476\n00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,590\nput one back in And\nwe're still ready to go.\n\n477\n00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,310\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n478\n00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,340\nSo, now we're on in, so in so at home-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n479\n00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,710\n>> I have a media server set up and\nall of my media files you know,\n\n480\n00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,825\nI set up a s, a storage spaces for\nit and it's on a, a p, parity space.\n\n481\n00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:34,363\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n482\n00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:36,860\n>> And I have put all of my media,\nand all the junk\n\n483\n00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,870\nsitting on there that I can stream out\nyou know, to the rest of the network.\n\n484\n00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,018\nAnd people can dial in and\nall that sort of\n\n485\n00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:42,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n486\n00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,640\n>> fun stuff.\n\n487\n00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,580\nWell, there's a problem with the machine.\n\n488\n00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,340\nAnd the, it just quit booting up and\nit did, e, essentially had failed.\n\n489\n00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,165\nAnd so, to replace the machine, I replaced\nit, well there's that storage pool.\n\n490\n00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:55,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n491\n00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,180\n>> Now on each one of those drives,\n\n492\n00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,205\nthe information about\nthe storage pool is written.\n\n493\n00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:04,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so I removed all those drives, and\n\n494\n00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,770\njust stuck then into the new computer.\n\n495\n00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,255\nAnd when I fired Windows Server back up.\n\n496\n00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:10,690\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd went into these storage spaces.\n\n497\n00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,980\nIt, it read the information\non each one of those drives.\n\n498\n00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,750\n>> Nice.\n>> And imported that pool right in there.\n\n499\n00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,270\nSo I, even though the computer failed,\nthe, the pool was, was saved.\n\n500\n00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,893\n>> So relatively portable as well,\nso that's some exciting news.\n\n501\n00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:23,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n502\n00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,970\nYeah, you know, and yeah, goodness sakes,\nyou know, with, with hardware raid I\n\n503\n00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,960\nhaven't had to, a lot of luck-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n504\n00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,760\n>> With hard, hardware raid, and computer\nfails, and having to rebuild structures,\n\n505\n00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,670\nbut you know, doing this here in software,\nit, it's incredibly easy.\n\n506\n00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,704\nSwap these drives out,\nit rebuilds the, the pool.\n\n507\n00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:41,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n508\n00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,535\n>> Very versatile,\nbuilt in with, with Windows.\n\n509\n00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n510\n00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,650\n>> Pretty pretty awesome.\n\n511\n00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,050\n>> Yeah, in this particular\nconfiguration right, the key for\n\n512\n00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,985\nus is knowing what types of drives\nthat you can create with this.\n\n513\n00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,940\nThe very simple volume, the mirrored or\n\n514\n00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,870\nthe parity volumes as well as\nunderstanding the number of hard drives\n\n515\n00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,190\nthat you need here to actually\nget each one configured.\n\n516\n00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,470\nSo they give you a, a, a, a,\npool here right, and, and\n\n517\n00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,130\nyou say hey here's,\nhere's what you actually have available.\n\n518\n00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,740\nMake sure you pay\nattention to those numbers,\n\n519\n00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,320\ncuz it's again going to be very\nimportant to us when we do this.\n\n520\n00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,240\nYou see the technology works fairly well,\nrelatively easily here, and\n\n521\n00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,070\nallows us to be able to set\nthis up again for customers.\n\n522\n00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,190\nThat, if we don't have the time right now,\nlet's say to take their computer offline\n\n523\n00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,390\nwe can set this up and actually create\nanother pool, pull all the stuff over\n\n524\n00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,675\nto it, and then maybe at some point in\ntime in the future replace smaller drives.\n\n525\n00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:33,911\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n526\n00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:41,600\nYeah, you know, and in the in 7410, 7410\ncovers storage spaces a bit more in depth.\n\n527\n00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,660\nBut when you have one of these\ndrive fails swap drives out and\n\n528\n00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,520\nhad to set it up to where you can\nrecover from those sorts of things.\n\n529\n00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,670\nAnd and a really awesome feature to\n\n530\n00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,620\nWindows Server 2012 R2,that is that\nstorage space is in enclosures.\n\n531\n00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,480\n>> Nice.\n>> That you can have\n\n532\n00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,668\nenclosure aware systems and all\nthe neat things that it does with that.\n\n533\n00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:04,900\nSo, you know, it has a bit more\nin depth storage spaces, but\n\n534\n00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,930\nas for as the client goes yeah,\nthe options and the, the wizard we\n\n535\n00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,470\njust ran through is just about all\nwe have on there to configure it.\n\n536\n00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n537\n00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,714\n>> So, neat technology, worth a look.\n\n538\n00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:21,100\nMake sure you, you at least know how to\nget access to it and know where to go.\n\n539\n00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,280\nRemember this is normally\nfound in control panel.\n\n540\n00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,100\nBut it's not one of the default\nones that you find there,\n\n541\n00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,880\nyou probably have to type\nit in to get access to it,\n\n542\n00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,180\ndon't forget you have the ability\nto change this option as well.\n\n543\n00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,430\nAll right.\n\n544\n00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,205\n>> All right, so there's storage spaces.\n\n545\n00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:36,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now the next technology that we have\n\n546\n00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,500\nlined up for data storage, is Google\n>> Cache.\n\n547\n00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,570\n>> Branch cache.\n\n548\n00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,110\n>> Branch cache.\n\n549\n00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,450\nSo what what's the story\nbehind branch cache?\n\n550\n00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,230\n>> Yeah.\nFor us in terms of branch cache, okay.\n\n551\n00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,860\nThis is really designed for\nbusinesses that have multiple sites, or\n\n552\n00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,660\nmultiple locations that they need to, to\nbe able to connect to and to share files.\n\n553\n00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,480\nSo it's not uncommon that, you know,\n\n554\n00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,280\nyou have a main office a lot of times and\nyou have a branch office.\n\n555\n00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,060\nAnd let's say that daily what\nends up happening is that\n\n556\n00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,500\npeople at the branch office are constantly\ngoing across the actual connection here\n\n557\n00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,910\nto retrieve copies of files and\ndownload them.\n\n558\n00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,120\nAnd it's not that it's a bad thing,\nbut let's say that you have ten or\n\n559\n00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,650\n15 users at that branch office and\n\n560\n00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,600\nthey're really retrieving let's say\nthe same copy of files all the time.\n\n561\n00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,910\nSo there's a lot of the same files\nthat are going across that link.\n\n562\n00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,170\nNow sometimes though\nthose links can be well,\n\n563\n00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,570\nrelatively anemic in terms of how much\ndata we can push through them at one time.\n\n564\n00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,050\nThey can become slow if you actually have\ndata transfers going on in the background.\n\n565\n00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:42,210\nSo what the idea of branch cache does for\nus here, okay, is gives us the ability\n\n566\n00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:47,020\nto essentially download the files\none time across that link.\n\n567\n00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,644\nAnd then instead of actually having\nevery other user at that site,\n\n568\n00:23:50,644 --> 00:23:53,630\ntry to connect all the way\nback over to the main office.\n\n569\n00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,818\nWhen they do it's gonna\nredirect them pass you,\n\n570\n00:23:56,818 --> 00:24:00,880\npoint to a local storage on their\nside of the network instead.\n\n571\n00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,946\nSo it really does help, especially over\nslow connections is where it really\n\n572\n00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:07,330\ndoes actually do its main job here.\n\n573\n00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:07,940\nYeah.\n\n574\n00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,560\nOkay?\n\n575\n00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n576\n00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,680\nYep.\n\n577\n00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,470\nNow, so yeah.\n\n578\n00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:15,570\nSo, you know, to, to check whether the\nfile has changed or not, it uses hashing.\n\n579\n00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it'll take a hash of that file and\n\n580\n00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,750\nas the client reaches out to look for\nthat file then the, the,\n\n581\n00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,410\ncache server will check with the content\nserver and if the hashes are the same,\n\n582\n00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,814\nthe file remains unchanged and then it is,\nyeah, sent down to the client.\n\n583\n00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:33,200\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yep, yep, from that cache.\n\n584\n00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,960\nAnd, of course, if it's changed then, you\nknow, as the client pulls down that new\n\n585\n00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,530\ncopy the, the caching server\nthen will keep a copy of it and\n\n586\n00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,270\nanybody else that needs to get it can then\nget it from that cached copy as well.\n\n587\n00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,130\n>> Yeah, so\n\n588\n00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,970\nthere's a lot of things going on in the\nbackground in terms of branch cache here.\n\n589\n00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,700\n'Kay?\n\n590\n00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,300\nNow for us,\nthere's really two basic systems of this\n\n591\n00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,910\nthat we have to understand\nwhat ends up happening.\n\n592\n00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:04,220\nIf your bigger office, that's the branch\noffice has a server ready to go.\n\n593\n00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,000\n'Kay?\n\n594\n00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,440\nWhat we can do is we can redirect all of\nthe actual caching happening into this\n\n595\n00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,050\none server.\n\n596\n00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,480\nAnd that is what we call BranchCache\nposted mode is what it is.\n\n597\n00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,950\nAnd what that means is when they actually\nget redirected they'll all actually pull\n\n598\n00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,140\noff this one file server,\nwhich is a really good thing.\n\n599\n00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,750\nOkay?\n\n600\n00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,620\nBut what if your site is a relatively new\nsite and you don't actually have any other\n\n601\n00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,920\nservers on your network, or not a server\nthat they want you to actually access.\n\n602\n00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,310\nWell, you can actually run what's\ncalled distributed mode here.\n\n603\n00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,770\nIn which if you're the first one to\nconnect, the information will be cached on\n\n604\n00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,550\nyour machine and then when a second\nuser tries to go on connect over and\n\n605\n00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,290\nif again the file hasn't changed, then\nI'll actually connect to your machine and\n\n606\n00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,690\ndownload it from there.\n\n607\n00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,240\nSo, it actually makes it a lot easier\nto actually be able to do this.\n\n608\n00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,970\n'Kay.\n\n609\n00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,170\nAnd then, actually work faster\nbecause your internal networks\n\n610\n00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,240\ngonna be a lot quicker than your\nconnection back over to the the,\n\n611\n00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,305\nthe connection to the main office.\n\n612\n00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:00,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n613\n00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,230\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah, you know,\n\n614\n00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,990\nand when using the distributed cache mode\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n615\n00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,910\n>> Let's say you're reaching\nacross the network and\n\n616\n00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,975\npulling down sensitive information.\n\n617\n00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:08,520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n618\n00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,060\n>> Right.\nWell if you have that stuff cached, you\n\n619\n00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,615\nknow, on a local machine, you know, it,\nit could impose a, a risk to that data.\n\n620\n00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n621\n00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,665\nWell, the distributed cache,\nit can be set up to use encryption.\n\n622\n00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that cache is encrypted.\n\n623\n00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,603\nAnd that way you don't have anybody being\nable to get into that local machine while\n\n624\n00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:28,096\nit's away from the file server or\nout of the, you know,\n\n625\n00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:31,740\nthe hands of you know, whatever you\nhave set up at the main office.\n\n626\n00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,260\nEncrypts it, so you know, it stays,\nstays safe as it sits there and rests.\n\n627\n00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n628\n00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,290\nNow for us, remember, we actually just\nhave to make sure that it is working for\n\n629\n00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:45,000\nus and that we're actually using the\ntechnology the way that needs to be done.\n\n630\n00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,810\nIn terms of setting up Brian's cache, that\nagain is actually one of our server shows\n\n631\n00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,450\nthat you can go and check out as well\nwhere we do set up the branch cache and\n\n632\n00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,550\nshows you how, how to get it set up,\nI guess, in both distributed and\n\n633\n00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,120\nhosted mode there so\nthat you can actually see how that works.\n\n634\n00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,780\nUsually at our end, right?\n\n635\n00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,040\nEither it's working or it isn't, 'kay?\n\n636\n00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,560\nWell, how do you know it is,\nhow do you know it isn't?\n\n637\n00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,350\nWanna talk about some of those\ndifferent things as well, okay?\n\n638\n00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,050\nIf it works fairly well, then we,\neverything is actually good.\n\n639\n00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,840\nSo, in,\nin terms of actually experiences, okay?\n\n640\n00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,575\nThe first person that connects over,\n\n641\n00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:20,410\nthey're gonna probably have\na relatively slow connection time,\n\n642\n00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,080\ndepending on whatever the link\nis back to the main office.\n\n643\n00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,540\nThen, the next person that goes to that\nparticular same location to retrieve those\n\n644\n00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,250\nfiles, their particular download is\ngoing to be almost lightning fast,\n\n645\n00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,220\nif not instantaneous at that point.\n\n646\n00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,650\nSo you can actually tell, in that way,\nin terms of the performance.\n\n647\n00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,710\nOkay?\n\n648\n00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,920\nAre there any other utilities\nwe can use to help us to\n\n649\n00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,745\nto be able to troubleshoot this\na little bit, for, or to help us out.\n\n650\n00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:45,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n651\n00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,250\nYeah, you know, there's a,\n\n652\n00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,800\na PowerShell command-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n653\n00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,680\n>> That we can use on the client side to\ncheck the you know, its configuration and\n\n654\n00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,360\nsettings-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n655\n00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,250\n>>

Yeah, yeah. >> Let's do it.\n\n659\n00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,870\n>> Yeah, sure.\nAll right.\n\n660\n00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,990\nSo I've got this machine right here.\n\n661\n00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,650\nAnd let's pull up good old PowerShell.\n\n662\n00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,578\nAnd we'll use an administrative one.\n\n663\n00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:12,364\n[MUSIC]\n\n664\n00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:13,398\nAll right.\nSo.\n\n665\n00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:16,022\nOh yeah, let me slide this guy over,\nshrink it down a little bit.\n\n666\n00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:20,578\nAll right.\n\n667\n00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:22,184\nSo, the first one that we can use.\n\n668\n00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:23,592\nRight?\n\n669\n00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:25,281\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n670\n00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:29,501\n>> Is get-bcstatus.\n\n671\n00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,215\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n672\n00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:37,120\n>> And this guy runs so there's a few\nitems here that will be worth looking at.\n\n673\n00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,760\nAs for our intents and purposes here.\n\n674\n00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,370\n>> Yup.\n\n675\n00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,940\n>> And go up here to the top.\n\n676\n00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,830\n>> There you go.\n\n677\n00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,400\n>> Yup.\nAll right.\n\n678\n00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,590\nThe very first one there\nBranchCacheIsEnabled.\n\n679\n00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,090\nTrue.\n>> Right.\n\n680\n00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,450\n>> All right, that is good.\n\n681\n00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,595\nSo, it's definitely enabled.\n\n682\n00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:55,688\nBranchCacheServiceStatus, just below that,\nit is running.\n\n683\n00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:56,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n684\n00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,980\n>> That's good.\n\n685\n00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,100\nDown under the client configuration,\nall right, CurrentClientMode.\n\n686\n00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,060\nSo, right now,\n\n687\n00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,815\nthis client that we're running on is\nset up as a, a hosted cache client.\n\n688\n00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:08,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n689\n00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,430\n>> So, it's going to be reaching out to a\ncaching server to grab those file shares.\n\n690\n00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,310\n>> Right.\n\n691\n00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:17,450\n>> Now the one just below it,\nthe, cache server list.\n\n692\n00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,510\nThese are the servers that are the-\n>> Right.\n\n693\n00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,280\n>> Hosted cache servers.\n\n694\n00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,415\nSo the ones that its gonna go to,\nto look for that hosted cache content.\n\n695\n00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:25,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n696\n00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,310\n>> Now new with Windows Server 2012 and\nWindows 8,\n\n697\n00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:33,920\nis that we can multiple\ncache servers in a site.\n\n698\n00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,360\nNow, under 2008 R2 and under Windows 7,\n\n699\n00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,100\nyou can only have one\ncache server per site.\n\n700\n00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,030\nBut now we can have more than that.\n\n701\n00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,790\nWe have two.\n\n702\n00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,995\n>> Now, before we go on from that, for\nus, right, if we can't retrieve a file,\n\n703\n00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:49,870\nit's going to be in that next section,\nthe content server configuration.\n\n704\n00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,380\nIf that says false that's an indication\n\n705\n00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,250\nthat you can't even get access\nto the files themselves.\n\n706\n00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,476\nSo you want to make sure\nthat says true as well.\n\n707\n00:29:57,476 --> 00:29:58,001\nYep.\n\n708\n00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:00,620\n>> Mm-hm, yeah you know and\n\n709\n00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,612\non, on the surface there,\nI mean that's, that is basically what,\n\n710\n00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:07,890\nwhat we're looking at and if any of those\nvalues are something different, False,\n\n711\n00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,060\nif it's not running or doesn't have a,\nserver list or anything now.\n\n712\n00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> At that point either escalate it or\n\n713\n00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,710\nit can start to narrow it down and,\nand find out what's going on.\n\n714\n00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:19,878\n>> Yeah, yeah, well at that point you're\ndefinitely not using branch cache.\n\n715\n00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:21,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's put it that way, right.\n\n716\n00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,030\nIf any of those are not True or\nFalse here, then,\n\n717\n00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,540\nthen we've got a problem, okay?\n\n718\n00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,910\nSo this actually goes out and\ngets the BranchCache status\n\n719\n00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,100\nupdated from the server error and says,\nhey, we're ready to go at that end.\n\n720\n00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,840\nSo, what do we need to do on our end?\n\n721\n00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,850\nOh, actually I,\nnow that I've took a look here and, what,\n\n722\n00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,040\nwhat we'll do is this, right?\n\n723\n00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,505\nIs that we have our break coming up.\n\n724\n00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n725\n00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,780\n>> Come back, we'll take a look at what\nwe need to do on the computer side,\n\n726\n00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,940\non our client side here to make\nsure that we actually have that\n\n727\n00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,875\nconfigured and ready to go.\n\n728\n00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:49,100\n>> Mm-hm, sweet.\n\n729\n00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,892\nAll right, so\nmore BranchCache stuff after the break.\n\n730\n00:30:59,368 --> 00:31:00,180\nAll right.\n\n731\n00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,870\nWelcome back.\n\n732\n00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,340\nAll right, so where we left off.\n\n733\n00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,105\nWe were talking about BranchCache.\n\n734\n00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:04,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n735\n00:31:04,880 -->

Mm-hm.\n>> So the client side\n\n738\n00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,710\nof the configuration.\n\n739\n00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,340\n>> Yep.\n\n740\n00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,630\n>> And an, anything I guess to\ntoss in before we jump into that?\n\n741\n00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,430\n>> No.\nRight,\n\n742\n00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,760\nonce the actual server-side is set up,\nright?\n\n743\n00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,600\nWe just need to make sure that our clients\nare ready to receive that connection.\n\n744\n00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,230\n>> Hm.\n>> That, that's what we need to do next.\n\n745\n00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,230\n>> All right, now to do that, all right,\nso there's a few different ways that we\n\n746\n00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,960\ncan set\n>> Right.\n\n747\n00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,720\n>> Set up for the, the client to\nparticipate in that branch cache.\n\n748\n00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,650\nWe can set up for, you know,\ndomain-joined clients and\n\n749\n00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,690\nit net processes different than\nif it was a non-domain-joined.\n\n750\n00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:44,960\nWe can set it up all manually\nthrough PowerShell or\n\n751\n00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,770\nwe can use group policy to push\nit out to all of our clients.\n\n752\n00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,120\nAnd for our purposes,\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n753\n00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,850\n>> Okay.\n>> We're gonna\n\n754\n00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,980\nuse group policy to push it out.\n\n755\n00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,750\nAnd, you know, in, in my opinion you know,\nwhen, when branch cache is deployed, most\n\n756\n00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,851\nlikely it will be in a business you know-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n757\n00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:02,710\n>> Enterprise-type environment.\n\n758\n00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,590\nAnd branch, or the group policy is\ngenerally what will be preferred.\n\n759\n00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,500\n>> Right.\n\n760\n00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n761\n00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,652\n>> Yeah, if we have to do this through\nthe local policy Which, it can be done and\n\n762\n00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:15,870\nyou'll see just about the same setup\nthat Nate's gonna walk you through.\n\n763\n00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,340\nIt gives more time for human error to\nclick on some of the different things here\n\n764\n00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,450\nby setting up in-group policy.\n\n765\n00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,350\nThen, what we can do is we\ncan push that policy out,\n\n766\n00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,150\nand that means all of the actual users and\n\n767\n00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,690\ncomputers will get the same Bigger policy\nsetting exactly the way that intended.\n\n768\n00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,990\nInstead of him calling me over to\nthe branch office saying, okay,\n\n769\n00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,860\non the twenty three computers you have\nover there make sure you click this and\n\n770\n00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,440\nmake sure it's actually the same each and\nevery time, right?\n\n771\n00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,660\nSo, yes, in a, in a regular business\nsituation, the way that we're about to do\n\n772\n00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,930\nis the way that you normally\nwould want to see See it.\n\n773\n00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,720\nBut these would be the same steps that\nyou could walk through in your local\n\n774\n00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,212\ngroup policy settings to do so as well.\n\n775\n00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:54,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n776\n00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,310\n>> Yup.\nAll right, so\n\n777\n00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,170\nthe first thing is that we'll jump\non to our domain controller, and\n\n778\n00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,390\nI do have the domain controller\npulled up right, right here.\n\n779\n00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,850\nAll right, and for the, the first step\nis that we have to get into our group.\n\n780\n00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,170\nPolicy management.\n\n781\n00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,610\nDuh, duh, duh.\n\n782\n00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,840\nAll right, and down,\ndown, duh down down down.\n\n783\n00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,400\nAll right.\n\n784\n00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,480\nSo, in our group policy,\noh jigsaw, collapse that guy.\n\n785\n00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,130\nIn our group policy objects, all right,\n\n786\n00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,620\nwe have different, our different\npolicies that we use, all right?\n\n787\n00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,140\nThere's And really we use this,\nwe roll back this domain every so often.\n\n788\n00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,760\n>> Right.\n>> So, it's, it's pretty empty, but\n\n789\n00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,240\nthe one that we are after,\nis this guy right here.\n\n790\n00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,850\nI created it before the show.\n\n791\n00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,980\n>> Yup.\n>> And so, for\n\n792\n00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,830\nthis one, we'll just chose to edit.\n\n793\n00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,550\nNow, if we're saving it from scratch,\nwe'd be creating this GPO and\n\n794\n00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,160\nthen editing this stuff here.\n\n795\n00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,530\n>> Yup.\n\n796\n00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,390\n>> All right, and so,\nwhat we will do is computer configuration.\n\n797\n00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:58,612\nAnd in policies, administrative templates\nand in network and BrancheCache.\n\n798\n00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:00,480\n>> BranchCache, yep.\n\n799\n00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,750\n>> Now, of these settings in here,\nthe ones that we're after for\n\n800\n00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,326\nour intents and purposes, right,\nis, of course, this very first one.\n\n801\n00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:10,273\nTurn on [CROSSTALK] cash.\n\n802\n00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:10,889\n>> Yeah, Yeah.\n\n803\n00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:14,400\nIf it's off you're not going to\nactually be able to make it work.\n\n804\n00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,440\nSo, we wanna make sure that it\nis enabled on the client so\n\n805\n00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,680\nthat if it does actually find a branch\ncash server, it can connect to it.\n\n806\n00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,235\nMake sense?\n\n807\n00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:21,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n808\n00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,020\nAll right, and so, this policy is enabled.\n\n809\n00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,600\nAll right.\n>> Mm.\n\n810\n00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,980\n>> Looks good, and the next one,\n\n811\n00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,920\nnow Depending on whether it's\nDistributed Cache or Hosted Cache, right?\n\n812\n00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:38,540\nSo, distributed the, the, the BranchCache\nis divided up among the client machines,\n\n813\n00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:44,560\nand then Hosted Cache a server is one\nthat holds all of that, cache data.\n\n814\n00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,540\nAnd for us, we're using Hosted Cache.\n\n815\n00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,520\nAnd we'll open up that policy there.\n\n816\n00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,150\nAnd it is enabled and then the name\nof our hosted cache server which for\n\n817\n00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:00,092\nthis one is itprotv-file.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n818\n00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:06,350\nAll right, and that is the hosted\ncache server so that is looking good.\n\n819\n00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,160\nAll right.\n\n820\n00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,860\nAnd this next one How?\n\n821\n00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,410\n>> Enable automatic posted cash\ndiscovery by service stash and point.\n\n822\n00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n823\n00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,010\n>> So, what this policy will do then is\nthe clients will be able to automatically\n\n824\n00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:25,600\ndiscover the posted cash service,\nbring another one up online later or\n\n825\n00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,770\nI guess either of the situations.\n\n826\n00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,020\nThe, the client.\n\n827\n00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,590\nWell, there's two ways right?\n\n828\n00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:35,430\nSo, they can automatically discover or\nwe can hard set who they talk to.\n\n829\n00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,150\n>> Right.\n\n830\n00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:40,250\n>> Right, and so, you know, and since we\nare in a, an active directory environment\n\n831\n00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,290\nthen automatically finding\nthem I believe is ideal.\n\n832\n00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:44,900\nSo, we've got that on.\n\n833\n00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,270\n>> All right.\n\n834\n00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:52,050\n>> Now let's say if they were not going to\nbe automatically automatically configured.\n\n835\n00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,630\nThis one right below it Is where we\ncould set those servers for a list.\n\n836\n00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,500\n>> Right.\n>> And they could go out,\n\n837\n00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,610\nbut automatically is good.\n\n838\n00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,260\nAnd the one below it.\n\n839\n00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,300\nAll right, configure branch cache for\nnetwork files.\n\n840\n00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,515\nOn this one Hold on,\nwe can set the link speed, right,\n\n841\n00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:13,950\nin latency in milliseconds on,\nwhen the caching actually begins.\n\n842\n00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,495\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n843\n00:36:14,495 --> 00:36:17,595\nlet's say if we're on a very fast link.\n\n844\n00:36:17,595 --> 00:36:20,060\nThen it may not be as necessary.\n\n845\n00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,625\nTo the cache out stuff.\n\n846\n00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:22,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n847\n00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,130\n>> Now, if we're on a very slow link.\n\n848\n00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,070\nOr, perhaps,\nif there's other services where, you know,\n\n849\n00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,110\nwe just needed to optimize,\nthe, the network.\n\n850\n00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,020\nYou know,\nthe the data optimization in there.\n\n851\n00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,420\nWe can set that here.\n\n852\n00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,140\nNow, by setting this number to zero\n\n853\n00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,167\nby default,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n854\n00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,280\n>> it's an 80.\n\n855\n00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,000\n80, 80 milliseconds.\n\n856\n00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,030\nBy setting it to zero, and that's,\nthat's gonna be pretty fast.\n\n857\n00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,540\nRight?\nLike instantaneous.\n\n858\n00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,700\nSo, caching is always enabled.\n\n859\n00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,200\n>> Yep.\n\n860\n00:36:50,738 --> 00:36:52,380\n>> All right, and so\nthere, so there we go.\n\n861\n00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,570\nSo these are the, the policy settings.\n\n862\n00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,910\nThat we need for the branch cache.\n\n863\n00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,220\nNow the second part that we will need.\n\n864\n00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> The firewall settings.\n\n865\n00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:09,490\nWe'll go into security And\nwindows firewall.\n\n866\n00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,340\nI feel like they nest this in that folder,\nbecause there's nothing in there.\n\n867\n00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,890\nIt's just down below it.\n\n868\n00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,410\nAlright, and\n\n869\n00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,840\nthen here we need to set inbound rules and\noutbound rules.\n\n870\n00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,760\nAll right, and for the inbound rules,\nthere are two that we are after.\n\n871\n00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,400\nAll right.\nVery first one, all right,\n\n872\n00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,180\nso there's, you're gonna be\ntwo inbound and two outbound.\n\n873\n00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,720\nAnd for the inbound, all right,\nthe branch cash content retrieval.\n\n874\n00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,290\nSo.\n>> Right.\n\n875\n00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:48,610\nHTTP and it's going to use this then to\nget out and retrieve that, that cache.\n\n876\n00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,020\nBy default on port 80 and\nthen, you can change it.\n\n877\n00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,280\n>> Yep.\n>> If, if you want to.\n\n878\n00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,301\nThe defaults work well and of course\nwe need to allow That connection.\n\n879\n00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:00,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n880\n00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,620\n>> And the other one here is\nthe branch cache peer discovery.\n\n881\n00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,266\nSo you can go out and\ndiscover the sosa cache.\n\n882\n00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:07,447\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n883\n00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:10,250\n>> Now the wsd\n>> Right, Ronnie?\n\n884\n00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,225\nYou know what little pop quiz.\n\n885\n00:38:12,225 --> 00:38:13,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know what that is?\n\n886\n00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,360\n>> No, don't have a clue.\n\n887\n00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,090\n>> Very bizarre.\n\n888\n00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,620\nThat is the the web web server.\n\n889\n00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,370\n>> Web server.\n\n890\n00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,860\n>> Web server, web services discovery.\n\n891\n00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,480\n>> Right. Okay. >> Right?\n\n892\n00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,550\nAnd, so\nthis allows the client computer to be\n\n893\n00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,340\nable to discover those services-\n>> Now?\n\n894\n00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,510\n>> On a local network.\n\n895\n00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,430\nYeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n896\n00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,080\n>> Okay.\n\n897\n00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,990\nNow before we move on from here, okay.\n\n898\n00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,790\nYou may go well, how the heck do we\nknow what, which ones to actually pick?\n\n899\n00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,730\nNate, if you'll go back up just to the\nWindows Firewall with Advanced Services.\n\n900\n00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,625\nThe, yeah.\nRight there.\n\n901\n00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:39,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n902\n00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,620\n>> Down at the bottom where it says\nGetting Started and inbound rules.\n\n903\n00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,510\nGo ahead and click on that, and\nthat way they can see where,\n\n904\n00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,410\nwhere this came from here.\n\n905\n00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,180\n>> Of course it doesn't.\n\n906\n00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,990\nWhy would it?\nI was hoping, yeah that.\n\n907\n00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,120\nSelect new rule, and then go down to that\npre-define and click that drop-down so\n\n908\n00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,400\nthat they can see there's several of\nthem that are actually right here.\n\n909\n00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,170\nAnd at the top notice that there's\nactually three of [INAUDIBLE] Them,\n\n910\n00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,590\nthe branch cast content retrieval hosted,\npeer discovery.\n\n911\n00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,800\nThese things are set in it, so\n\n912\n00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,550\nwe want something that Nate just picked\nout of the air, okay, and created.\n\n913\n00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,310\nThese are the ones that I said, look,\npeople are gonna actually wanna do this,\n\n914\n00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,630\nand so they want they firewall on\nthe client to be able to get access in.\n\n915\n00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,800\nSo, here's the ones that they\nmay actually want to pick out.\n\n916\n00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,040\nSo, so by using those pre-defined\nrules makes it easier or\n\n917\n00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,504\nyou can try manually do\nthis on your own as well.\n\n918\n00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:26,380\n[LAUGH] and create that.\n\n919\n00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,570\nSo, it's not something we\njust picked out of the air.\n\n920\n00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,132\nThey are here under the pre-defined list.\n\n921\n00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:32,360\n>> Thanks.\n\n922\n00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,110\nI forgot to bring that up.\n\n923\n00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,940\n>> Oh, that's fine.\n\n924\n00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,500\n>> Yet these are pre-defined rules.\n\n925\n00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,240\nSo we need those, too, for the inbound.\n\n926\n00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,680\nAnd on the outbound,\nit'll be the same, too.\n\n927\n00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,280\n>> 'Kay.\n>> Or\n\n928\n00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,230\nthe course this one,\ninstead of HTTP in, right?\n\n929\n00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,110\nThe, it's HTTP out.\n\n930\n00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:53,890\n>> Yup.\n>> And if we do look at the new rule, and\n\n931\n00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,510\nat predefined,\n>> There we go,\n\n932\n00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,840\nbranch cash content retrieval.\n\n933\n00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,570\nAnd the peer discovery.\n\n934\n00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,172\n>> Yep.\n\n935\n00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:07,538\n>> All right, so once we have those\nfirewall rule set, and we have the other\n\n936\n00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:12,210\npolicy settings set, for the client\nThen for this policy, we are done.\n\n937\n00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:16,583\nAnd the last thing would be to link\nthis policy to wherever that computer or\n\n938\n00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,700\nthe computers where we want\nto receive this policy.\n\n939\n00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,690\nSo at the remote office.\n\n940\n00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,200\nAnd we do have one that is off site.\n\n941\n00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,580\nHere in are the Jonesville division.\n\n942\n00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,380\nIt's, it's very small, so it's not a lot.\n\n943\n00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,695\nThere's one, there's one\ncomputer hanging out over there.\n\n944\n00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:33,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n945\n00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,790\nwe then have linked that policy there.\n\n946\n00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,565\n>> So this policy over a period\nof time about 90 minutes or so.\n\n947\n00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:44,445\nThe policy will push out to\nthat particular computer and\n\n948\n00:40:44,445 --> 00:40:46,765\nthen those settings will be applied.\n\n949\n00:40:46,765 --> 00:40:48,855\nFirewall rules will be in place.\n\n950\n00:40:48,855 --> 00:40:50,405\nThe branch cache will be turned on, and\n\n951\n00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:53,855\nthe other things that we also\nenabled will also be turned on.\n\n952\n00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:56,435\nOr if we have access to that,\nwe could actually either\n\n953\n00:40:56,435 --> 00:41:01,070\nreboot that particular computer or\nrun the idea of of our update, right?\n\n954\n00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,950\nThe gpupdate with the forward slash force,\n\n955\n00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,485\nthat will actually allow that\nsetting to take place right away.\n\n956\n00:41:06,485 --> 00:41:07,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n957\n00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,920\n>> For the policy to take place.\n\n958\n00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,790\n>> All right.\nYep.\n\n959\n00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,746\nAnd in that case, let to duh, duh, dum.\n\n960\n00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:14,435\nAll right.\n\n961\n00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:17,392\nLet me get connected over to\nthat client sitting over there.\n\n962\n00:41:20,248 --> 00:41:22,315\nAnd 151 minus N.\n\n963\n00:41:26,563 --> 00:41:30,675\n>> Mm, mm, mm.\n\n964\n00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:33,180\nSuper secret password.\n\n965\n00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,240\nIt's probably the same password you use.\n\n966\n00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,435\n>> It is possibly, yeah probably.\n\n967\n00:41:37,435 --> 00:41:39,630\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n968\n00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,590\nAll right.\nSo once we get connected to this client.\n\n969\n00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,870\nHey, yeah.\nThis is slow link, slow link day today.\n\n970\n00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,990\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n971\n00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,435\n>> It should have set\nup in 80 milliseconds.\n\n972\n00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:51,940\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n973\n00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,580\nWhoo.\n>> It's probably cuz that huge\n\n974\n00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,000\npolicy you were putting out\nacross the link at the same time.\n\n975\n00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,720\n>> I know.\nYeah.\n\n976\n00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,940\nYeah, goodness sakes.\n\n977\n00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,380\nBut yeah, so this here,\nit is indeed in a remote- it's off-site.\n\n978\n00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,580\nI guess that explains why it\nwas taking a little long.\n\n979\n00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,020\nAlright, so let's say you know we\njust configured that policy and\n\n980\n00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,010\nwe just barely linked it.\n\n981\n00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,987\nSo now we go to this client right here and\n\n982\n00:42:17,987 --> 00:42:22,945\nwe can either restart this machine or\nduh, duh, duh.\n\n983\n00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:31,557\nAnd I'll do that just for fun.\n\n984\n00:42:31,557 --> 00:42:35,573\nA gpupdate/force.\n\n985\n00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:38,963\nAll right, and so now this will\nreach out to that domain controller,\n\n986\n00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:42,470\nit will check to see if there's any\nnew policies that he needs to apply,\n\n987\n00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,470\nand it will apply that,\nand apply everything else.\n\n988\n00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,559\nAll right.\n>> See all the other policies that we\n\n989\n00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:48,917\nhave linked to this guy.\n\n990\n00:42:51,725 --> 00:42:53,001\nAs it reaches out and does that.\n\n991\n00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,050\nNow.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n992\n00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,230\n>> The next thing it will do is,\n\n993\n00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,455\nonce it refreshes this,\nis that branch cash service.\n\n994\n00:42:58,455 --> 00:43:00,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We need to do, stop the service and\n\n995\n00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,320\nthen restart that service.\n\n996\n00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,120\nMake sure that things are, are running.\n\n997\n00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,730\n>> Yup.\n\n998\n00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,940\n>> After that we should be good to go.\n\n999\n00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,150\n>> Right.\n>> It should be configured, ready to go.\n\n1000\n00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,300\nWe can start retrieving\nthose items that we.\n\n1001\n00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,305\nWe have flagged four branch cache.\n\n1002\n00:43:12,305 --> 00:43:13,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1003\n00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,820\n>> On the, on the file server.\n\n1004\n00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,600\nAnd beginning cache in that that content.\n\n1005\n00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,150\n>> There you go.\n\n1006\n00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,952\n>> As it reaches out.\n\n1007\n00:43:20,952 --> 00:43:23,690\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It does take a little bit of\n\n1008\n00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,590\ntime for it to actually do this.\n\n1009\n00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,510\nSo, yup.\n\n1010\n00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,830\nYup.\n\n1011\n00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,930\nNow, for us, right?\n\n1012\n00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:33,440\nAgain, knowing these steps\nare really what helps us.\n\n1013\n00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,270\nSo it's to be able to troubleshoot, right.\n\n1014\n00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:39,280\nSo from this point we know that the server\nwas setup correctly and we can go back and\n\n1015\n00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,790\nverify that this policy that we actually\nhave enabled, if it actually is there, we\n\n1016\n00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,290\nneed to now actually be able see in just\na moment here as it does it whether or\n\n1017\n00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,530\nnot it applied.\n\n1018\n00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,210\nSo at this point there's a couple\nways where we can do this,\n\n1019\n00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,700\nwe can either try and check it out or\nwe can run that command that we're running\n\n1020\n00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,515\non a previous show here which\nis the GP result, right?\n\n1021\n00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And see what happens.\n\n1022\n00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,610\n>> Should we run it right now?\n\n1023\n00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,470\n>> Yeah, let's run it.\n\n1024\n00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,510\n>> Do the dash r or the /r, whichever one.\n\n1025\n00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:10,960\n>> I always get that one wrong.\n\n1026\n00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,332\nThat PowerShell thing\nkills me with a dash.\n\n1027\n00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:21,238\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1028\n00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:22,934\nLet's go to Skype here to the top.\n\n1029\n00:44:22,934 --> 00:44:29,494\n[NOISE] Hey, look at that,\napplied group policy objects.\n\n1030\n00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:30,561\n>> Mm?\n\n1031\n00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:32,420\nWhich one are we looking for Nate?\n\n1032\n00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,410\n>> Alright, the branch cache client.\n\n1033\n00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:34,950\n>> There we go.\n>> So\n\n1034\n00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,370\nthat posse there and then pull that down.\n\n1035\n00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,510\nSweet.\n\n1036\n00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,260\n>> Yup.\n\n1037\n00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,900\nSo on that particular computer\nin Jonesville right now, right?\n\n1038\n00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,990\nWe know that the policy\nhas pushed out there so\n\n1039\n00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,779\nat this point we can go ahead and\ntest it and see if it's actually working.\n\n1040\n00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,860\nOkay.\n\n1041\n00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,680\nSo here Nate is actually\nrunning the service\n\n1042\n00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,970\nthat actually needs to be stopped here.\n\n1043\n00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,010\nAnd then we'll restart it.\n\n1044\n00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,610\nNotice it says branch\ncache services stopping.\n\n1045\n00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,230\nSo notice the name here as he\nactually uses the net stop command.\n\n1046\n00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:11,790\nAnd now he's gonna do a net start,\nas well.\n\n1047\n00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,210\nAnd so he's just kind of feel like,\nyou know,\n\n1048\n00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,370\ntoggling the switch is\nwhat he's doing here.\n\n1049\n00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,340\nAnd in terms of that service, to make sure\nthat everything is actually ready to go.\n\n1050\n00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,760\nOh, now he's going to go to powers.\n\n1051\n00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,190\nWhat's he getting?\n\n1052\n00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,780\nOop, he's getting status for us.\n\n1053\n00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,900\nWe'll scroll back up there and\nsure enough, so branch cache is enabled.\n\n1054\n00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,310\nTrue, right the service is running.\n\n1055\n00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,560\nWe are set up for the hosted cache and\nwe are reaching out to the correct server.\n\n1056\n00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,250\nYup.\n>> For that.\n\n1057\n00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,210\nGood to go.\n\n1058\n00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:46,750\nAll set up.\n\n1059\n00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,700\n>> So,\nthese particular commands that we use.\n\n1060\n00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,400\nOkay.\n\n1061\n00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,120\nAgain, they're not foreign commands.\n\n1062\n00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,050\nThey're not something you shouldn't go,\nI don't need to worry about that.\n\n1063\n00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,400\nThese are actually good\ntroubleshooting utilities for\n\n1064\n00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,100\nyou if it's not working right.\n\n1065\n00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,330\nIf it's not working, you might see that\nbranch cache is enabled says false, right?\n\n1066\n00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:09,490\nOr the actual status is not running\nwhich is another one for us here.\n\n1067\n00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,100\nAgain, the content server's enabled.\n\n1068\n00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,920\nIf it says false you're not gonna\nbe able to retrieve files, as well.\n\n1069\n00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,250\nSo, just make sure that you actually\nhave these things in mind when\n\n1070\n00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,540\nyou do troubleshoot this little bit.\n\n1071\n00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,400\n>> All right.\n\n1072\n00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,020\nSo, there we go.\nSo, there's,\n\n1073\n00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:27,250\nthere's BranchCache setting up on the\nclient side, make sure things are working.\n\n1074\n00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,316\nCorrectly.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1075\n00:46:28,316 --> 00:46:30,420\n>> Now moving on to the I guess,\n\n1076\n00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,050\nthe third little data storage\ntechnology that we'll cover.\n\n1077\n00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:33,675\nThat is DFS.\n\n1078\n00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:34,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1079\n00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,740\n>> The Distributed File System.\n\n1080\n00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,410\nDFS is, is pretty sweet, right.\n\n1081\n00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,080\n>> It is.\n>> So let's say you have a collection of\n\n1082\n00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,875\nnetwork shares that are spread\namong different file servers.\n\n1083\n00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:47,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well if you, if a, you know a,\n\n1084\n00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,060\na user, end-user needs to.\n\n1085\n00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,610\nNow you get to that file share.\n\n1086\n00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,715\nYou've got to know the server name and\nthe share name.\n\n1087\n00:46:52,715 --> 00:46:54,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To be able to get to that share.\n\n1088\n00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,580\nLet's say there's a let's say you've\ngot a, a large environment, right.\n\n1089\n00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,420\nAnd so,\nthere's these long server names I mean,\n\n1090\n00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,310\npoor old Betty in Accounting\nnow needs to remember.\n\n1091\n00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,330\nAll these different server names and\n\n1092\n00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,250\nshare names,\nshould be able to get to that share.\n\n1093\n00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:11,801\nAnd if they're all spread over the place,\nit can be texting or texting, taxing.\n\n1094\n00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:12,651\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1095\n00:47:12,651 --> 00:47:14,613\n>> Taxing on poor old buddy to get there.\n\n1096\n00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:18,646\n>> Yeah, when things actually again spread\nout because file shares were created\n\n1097\n00:47:18,646 --> 00:47:20,560\nagain, you know a little bit at a time.\n\n1098\n00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,280\nIn other words, when the design.\n\n1099\n00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,670\nIssue here is just we needed one,\nwe created one and now, all of the sudden,\n\n1100\n00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:27,516\nwe have 5 or\n\n1101\n00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:31,600\n6 different file shares where one would\nhave actually been enough as well.\n\n1102\n00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,250\nOkay?\n\n1103\n00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,750\nWith DFS, though,\nwe can do something about that.\n\n1104\n00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,850\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1105\n00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,410\nYeah.\n\n1106\n00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,865\nNow, now DFS, right, so the, at the very\nheart of it it has a, a name space.\n\n1107\n00:47:41,865 --> 00:47:42,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1108\n00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:47,370\nThis name space is where all of these\nshares can be combined together.\n\n1109\n00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:52,480\nSo it's like a logical folder,\nmore or less, a single location.\n\n1110\n00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,254\nWithin that single location\nwe can set up folders and\n\n1111\n00:47:56,254 --> 00:47:58,670\nthese folders can have targets.\n\n1112\n00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,170\nThose targets will then point\nto different file shares.\n\n1113\n00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,210\nSo let's say you have a file share on.\n\n1114\n00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,460\nServer A and file share server B.\n\n1115\n00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1116\n00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,782\n>> Well you can combine both of those\nshares as targets under one folder.\n\n1117\n00:48:12,782 --> 00:48:14,955\n>> Yeah.\n>> In the DFS name space.\n\n1118\n00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:17,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so add, so with, old Betty.\n\n1119\n00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,320\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1120\n00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,848\n>> So now she just has to go to one place,\n\n1121\n00:48:20,848 --> 00:48:24,280\none folder to reach to\nall those other targets.\n\n1122\n00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,190\n>> Yeah, it makes it a lot easier for most\nend users instead of remembering which\n\n1123\n00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:31,810\none they have to go to, if they're\ngonna retrieve whatever file they need.\n\n1124\n00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,890\nSo the DFS name space works really well,\nokay?\n\n1125\n00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:38,260\nBut sometimes though, it may not.\n\n1126\n00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,840\nOkay?\n\n1127\n00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,470\nAnd so in that instance here if you\nare running the DFS, we do need to\n\n1128\n00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:47,060\nat least be able to know what are some\nof the things that can happen.\n\n1129\n00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,870\nOkay?\n\n1130\n00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:51,330\nSo one of them is you may not actually\nbe able to connect with that space.\n\n1131\n00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:55,450\nSo it could be, what, a,\na name resolution problem.\n\n1132\n00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:56,110\nHm, yeah.\n\n1133\n00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,090\n>> Yeah, you know in the, I, yeah at the,\n[LAUGH] at the heart right, so so\n\n1134\n00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:06,010\nthe DFS relies on, on the DF DNS\nto find the yeah that name space.\n\n1135\n00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,970\n>> Yeah?\n>> And you know to get to that name space,\n\n1136\n00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,674\nright, you, we can actually,\n>> We have DFS up and running in here.\n\n1137\n00:49:10,674 --> 00:49:11,910\n>> Ooh, nice.\n\n1138\n00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,310\n>> We can browse to it, right?\n\n1139\n00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:18,078\nSo we browse to it by // on your C path?\n\n1140\n00:49:18,078 --> 00:49:23,344\n>> Lab.itpro.tv [SOUND] tv/, and\n\n1141\n00:49:23,344 --> 00:49:28,992\nI believe that is called lab files.\n\n1142\n00:49:28,992 --> 00:49:30,130\nOoh, ooh.\n\n1143\n00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:35,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it is not, what did I name it?\n\n1144\n00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,211\n>> I do not know now.\n\n1145\n00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:40,430\n[LAUGH] You'll probably have to go and\ncheck because I don't know what you-\n\n1146\n00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,668\n>> It does say lab files doesn't it?\n\n1147\n00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:45,775\n>> Mm, yeah, that's why I mapped it I-\n>> No.\n\n1148\n00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,049\n[LAUGH]\n>> I made a, a preference.\n\n1149\n00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:47,583\n>> No.\n\n1150\n00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,341\n[LAUGH]\n>> So it, [LAUGH] so it,\n\n1151\n00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:50,524\nautomatically maps to-\n\n1152\n00:49:50,524 --> 00:49:51,634\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Every person-\n\n1153\n00:49:51,634 --> 00:49:52,227\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1154\n00:49:52,227 --> 00:49:54,920\n>> That that goes out there.\n\n1155\n00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,900\nBut you know what?\n\n1156\n00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,062\nLet let's just get down to the hardware.\n\n1157\n00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We can jump over the server.\n\n1158\n00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,060\nWe can grab that name.\n\n1159\n00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,660\n>> That's right.\n\n1160\n00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,360\nLet's grab the name.\n\n1161\n00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,810\n>> Duh, duh, dun.\n\n1162\n00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,060\nJust a little detour.\n\n1163\n00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,201\nWe're on 201,\nI believe that's the correct one.\n\n1164\n00:50:24,143 --> 00:50:26,160\nYeah, it, no, it says it's right.\n\n1165\n00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:26,950\nAnd that\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1166\n00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,380\n>> That is what you typed in.\n\n1167\n00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:28,960\nYeah, lab.\n\n1168\n00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,520\nAll right, yeah.\n\n1169\n00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:34,320\nSo I guess that now that we're in here,\nright, we can drill down so\n\n1170\n00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,250\nthere's our, our name space, right?\n\n1171\n00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,840\nLab files and under lab files, right,\n\n1172\n00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,230\nwe have just these, these few,\nthese three folders here.\n\n1173\n00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,620\nWhere we can stick our lab files in.\n\n1174\n00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,565\nAnd with these lab files\nthere's this one folder target.\n\n1175\n00:50:47,565 --> 00:50:48,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1176\n00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,740\n>> That is, yeah, it is there\n>> Yeah.\n\n1177\n00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,520\n>> So, yeah, not the,\ncrazy complicated setup.\n\n1178\n00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,136\nYeah, that is indeed the,\nthe, the correct name.\n\n1179\n00:50:58,136 --> 00:51:00,051\n>> Yeah.\n\n1180\n00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:00,654\n>> All right.\n\n1181\n00:51:00,654 --> 00:51:05,658\nSo let the,\nlet's get back to our clients [SOUND].\n\n1182\n00:51:05,658 --> 00:51:07,400\n>> See what's happened here.\n\n1183\n00:51:24,772 --> 00:51:28,425\n>> As it connects-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1184\n00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:29,550\n>> Well I guess this would give us\n\n1185\n00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,630\nan opportunity to to test\nthose couple commands.\n\n1186\n00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,396\n>> Yeah.\n\n1187\n00:51:32,396 --> 00:51:33,700\n>> Sure everything is up and running.\n\n1188\n00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,170\nOf course we do know everything is up and\nrunning.\n\n1189\n00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,400\nYou know, this lab file is here is mapped.\n\n1190\n00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,140\nAnd we do have our little\nconnections that we can browse into.\n\n1191\n00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:48,848\nAnd there's some endop stuff we can\ngrab things out of out of there.\n\n1192\n00:51:48,848 --> 00:51:49,556\nLet's just try it again.\n\n1193\n00:51:49,556 --> 00:51:54,456\nSo ah,// [SOUND]\n\n1194\n00:51:54,456 --> 00:52:02,952\nlab.itvpro.tvs/Labfiles\n\n1195\n00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:05,241\n[LAUGH].\n\n1196\n00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:08,840\nAll right, so, I didn't capitalize it\n>> [LAUGH] oh there you go, yeah\n\n1197\n00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,050\n>> I didn't put in the dagone capital L,\n\n1198\n00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:15,880\nso there we go so that is DFS namespace\n>> Yeah.\n\n1199\n00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:21,180\n>> Now if, so if these folders then were\nscattered out through all, all these,\n\n1200\n00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,030\nthese different file servers, which,\nI mean, they're not in this one but.\n\n1201\n00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,859\n>> Yeah.\n>> They could be.\n\n1202\n00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:26,791\n>> Yeah.\n>> Before the end user it will look\n\n1203\n00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:27,740\nall the same.\n\n1204\n00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,920\n>> Yeah.\nIt'll look like one figure location\n\n1205\n00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,710\nthat their going to.\n\n1206\n00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:34,200\nSo these things did resided\non three separate, servers.\n\n1207\n00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,040\nWe can again combine them together.\n\n1208\n00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,060\nOkay, and so\n\n1209\n00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:42,320\nthis is a fairly popular technology\nthat we do have for for what we need.\n\n1210\n00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,470\nNow the, the best thing about it is the,\nthe resiliency behind it, right?\n\n1211\n00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:49,310\nThe ability to actually be able to,\nto change things up.\n\n1212\n00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,320\nAnd the lab, and\nthe name not as she, end up matter.\n\n1213\n00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,650\nSo, so for us, right, with the itpro,\nthe lab at itpro.tv, right?\n\n1214\n00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,210\nIf we added in more folders\nit doesn't mean that what,\n\n1215\n00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:06,170\nBetty, as we're using your example,\nhas to use a new figure path to go to.\n\n1216\n00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:10,350\nGo to the same location and those new\nfolders would also appear there, as well.\n\n1217\n00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,445\nSo, so it really does help in that sense,\nfor us.\n\n1218\n00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:14,560\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1219\n00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,900\nYeah, you know, and, with DFS, right?\n\n1220\n00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,580\nSo, it does have replication.\n\n1221\n00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,340\nSo we have different sites scattered\naround that can that, you know,\n\n1222\n00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:28,150\nthat can replicate this, the yeah,\nthese files to that location.\n\n1223\n00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:30,730\nWe're gonna have referral lists for\nour clients.\n\n1224\n00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,120\nThat based on their location,\n\n1225\n00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:37,420\nthey can reach out to certain you know\ntheir own site to retrieve this content.\n\n1226\n00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,800\nAnd if that content goes down,\nor that server goes down,\n\n1227\n00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,620\nit can be redirected to another\nsite to grab that stuff.\n\n1228\n00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:48,630\nAnd, you know, even if the server\nnames change or, or whatever.\n\n1229\n00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,665\nIt doesn't matter to the end user.\n\n1230\n00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:50,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because they're going\n\n1231\n00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,202\nto that namespace right?\n\n1232\n00:53:52,202 --> 00:53:58,475\nThe //lab.itpro.tv or you know,\n/Labfiles or whatever it's set up to be.\n\n1233\n00:53:58,475 --> 00:54:00,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You can always go to that one location\n\n1234\n00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,340\nand it will replicate out and\nalways stay up.\n\n1235\n00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,200\n>> Yeah.\nMm-hm.\n\n1236\n00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,270\nSo if things aren't working what are some\nof the commands that we were just about\n\n1237\n00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,020\nto share?\n\n1238\n00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,461\nOr do we want to wait until\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1239\n00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:09,936\n[INAUDIBLE].\n>> Yeah, let's yeah we'll we'll,\n\n1240\n00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:11,169\nwe'll leave it on a cliff\nhanger right there.\n\n1241\n00:54:11,169 --> 00:54:12,120\n>> Okay, we'll leave it on a cliff hanger.\n\n1242\n00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,855\n>> Right there, so\nwe'll get into some DFS commands and\n\n1243\n00:54:15,855 --> 00:54:18,262\ncheck in on stuff after the break.\n\n1244\n00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:25,494\n[MUSIC]\n\n1245\n00:54:25,494 --> 00:54:27,050\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n1246\n00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:30,930\nAll right, so where we left off\nwe're talking about DFS and\n\n1247\n00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,666\nabout some commands-\n>> Yep.\n\n1248\n00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:35,929\n>> That we can use to I guess\ntest our DFS settings and\n\n1249\n00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:38,525\nto make sure everything works.\n\n1250\n00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,535\nAlthough, if you can't browse to it,\nsomething's broke.\n\n1251\n00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:44,355\n>> Yeah.\nIf the namespace isn't working right?\n\n1252\n00:54:44,355 --> 00:54:46,895\nThat's where you actually do have\nan indication that something is not\n\n1253\n00:54:46,895 --> 00:54:48,115\nworking correctly.\n\n1254\n00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:50,962\nBut the problem is,\nmost of the time, for us right?\n\n1255\n00:54:50,962 --> 00:54:53,902\nIt's not something that we're\ngonna be able to fix usually,\n\n1256\n00:54:53,902 --> 00:54:56,542\nunless we've all ready set\nup the DFS here on our own.\n\n1257\n00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:59,652\nSo again, this is gonna be a place where\nwe might actually have to say hey,\n\n1258\n00:54:59,652 --> 00:55:01,708\nwe've gotta go and find you know.\n\n1259\n00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,210\nWhy this name space isn't working and\n\n1260\n00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,360\nthat may be an escalation\nissue at this point, okay?\n\n1261\n00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,690\nBut there are some things that we\ncan do to actually verify that\n\n1262\n00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:09,670\neverything is working.\n\n1263\n00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,690\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, a couple of commands.\n\n1264\n00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:13,100\nSo we'll we'll touch on them.\n\n1265\n00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:17,150\nSo I have my client machine up and\na command window here.\n\n1266\n00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,430\n>> Nice.\n>> And there is one command, right?\n\n1267\n00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,161\nSo,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1268\n00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:29,785\n>> dfsutil /spcinfo.\n\n1269\n00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:30,355\nAll right.\n\n1270\n00:55:30,355 --> 00:55:32,920\nSo we get,\na little bit of information back, right?\n\n1271\n00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,590\nNow, of course, if we had replication and,\nand, a lot of servers and targets, things\n\n1272\n00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:42,290\nparticipating in our DFS name space, the,\nthere'd be a lot more to this output.\n\n1273\n00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,870\nBut since ours is, is very small,\nwe get a little bit of output.\n\n1274\n00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:51,510\nBut so, but right away we can\nsee that we can contact our,\n\n1275\n00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:55,005\nour name space, and\nwe are seeing the correct server.\n\n1276\n00:55:55,005 --> 00:55:55,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right?\n\n1277\n00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:56,990\nEverything looks pretty good.\n\n1278\n00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:57,540\nYep.\n\n1279\n00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,130\nAll right.\n\n1280\n00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,630\nSo there is another one, right?\n\n1281\n00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:06,300\nThe good old dfsdiag and\nif we do a little space /?\n\n1282\n00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,715\nWe see that we have some\ncommands here to test things.\n\n1283\n00:56:09,715 --> 00:56:10,835\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1284\n00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:11,335\n>> All right.\n\n1285\n00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:13,215\nSo for us.\n\n1286\n00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:17,040\nLet's go dfsdiag\n\n1287\n00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:24,435\n/testdfsconfig /dfs:\\\\ and\n\n1288\n00:56:24,435 --> 00:56:28,260\nthen our name, so\n\n1289\n00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:34,892\nlab.itpro.tv\\labfiles.\n\n1290\n00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,450\nAllright.\n\n1291\n00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:41,850\nAnd so now, this will test\nthe configuration of our DFS name space.\n\n1292\n00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:42,350\n>> Okay?\n\n1293\n00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:45,480\n>> And it should return,\nyeah, some results here.\n\n1294\n00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,910\nThere it goes.\nAll right so it's now querying everything.\n\n1295\n00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,140\nAnd checking on all that stuff.\n\n1296\n00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:56,510\nAnd as it comes back sure enough, success!\n\n1297\n00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:00,868\nRight, so\nthat name space service is started, and\n\n1298\n00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:02,970\nit's running, it's validating our stuff.\n\n1299\n00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,940\nNow, I am a fan of the baby blue text,\n\n1300\n00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,940\nlike you know, when you get a command\nwrong in PowerShell, right?\n\n1301\n00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,740\nIt was all this red-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1302\n00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,240\n>> Text.\n\n1303\n00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,380\nIt's, like, my eyes,\n\n1304\n00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,030\nkinda scarring to see all that red text.\n\n1305\n00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:16,650\nBut-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1306\n00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,080\n>> Yeah, here we get a pretty blue, so\n\n1307\n00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,710\nI, I like that.\n\n1308\n00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,675\n>> Yup.\n>> Yup.\n\n1309\n00:57:19,675 --> 00:57:23,830\nAllright, so, so this really does help\nus to test that out and get it set up.\n\n1310\n00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:26,260\nSo some of the issues\nthat we can also face,\n\n1311\n00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,440\nis the very fact like anything in DN,\nDNS, right, using namespaces.\n\n1312\n00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,700\nThe information can be cached.\n\n1313\n00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,240\nSo it could be that you\nchanged a namespace, and\n\n1314\n00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,500\nit's still getting the actual\nold namespace in it, okay?\n\n1315\n00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,750\nSo that happens.\n\n1316\n00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,840\nThere are things that you can do, such\nas restarting the computer to actually\n\n1317\n00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,420\nmake it cache that information again.\n\n1318\n00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,550\nBut there's another place that you can go\ninside of your computer, to actually tell\n\n1319\n00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,290\nit to chan, or actually, there's,\nwe, we can change the timing here.\n\n1320\n00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:56,950\nBut let's go ahead and, and\n\n1321\n00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:01,160\ntake a look at my computer as where\nwe're going at this point too.\n\n1322\n00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,280\nOkay, so this is under the local\ngroup policy, and, again,\n\n1323\n00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,650\nthis can be set up in, in the active\ndirectory group policy as well.\n\n1324\n00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,000\nSo I expand it out.\n\n1325\n00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,310\nThe computer configurations,\nadministrative templates, and\n\n1326\n00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:18,100\nthen from there, network,\nand it is at network here.\n\n1327\n00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,385\nThat's down here at the bottom.\n\n1328\n00:58:19,385 --> 00:58:20,400\n[LAUGH]\n>> I thought so.\n\n1329\n00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,400\n>> That I have, yeah.\n\n1330\n00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,760\nLet me see if I can zoom in here.\n\n1331\n00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,730\nOoh, there we go.\n\n1332\n00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:26,430\nOkay.\n\n1333\n00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:31,660\nHow to, configure how often\na DFS client discovers,\n\n1334\n00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,060\nyou know, the domain nameplace.\n\n1335\n00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,260\nRight?\nThe domain controllers, as well.\n\n1336\n00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:37,770\nNow.\n\n1337\n00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,330\nThis one actually says\nthe domain controller,\n\n1338\n00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,720\nnow that's where we\nactually had it set up.\n\n1339\n00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,280\nAnd notice that it can actually talk to\nthat, to actually be able to do that.\n\n1340\n00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,340\nAnd you can, and I think the minimum\nhere is only ten minutes.\n\n1341\n00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,040\nOops.\n\n1342\n00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,130\nIt won't let me actually change it.\n\n1343\n00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,590\nLet's see, see if I can do zero.\n\n1344\n00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,330\nNope.\n'Kay.\n\n1345\n00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,885\nOh, 15 is actually the minimum.\n\n1346\n00:58:59,885 --> 00:59:00,840\nMm-hm.\n>> So I, I couldn't re,\n\n1347\n00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,280\nI thought it was 10 or\n15, I couldn't remember.\n\n1348\n00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,840\nNow can you change this?\n\n1349\n00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,890\nYes.\nOne of the utilities that Nate actually\n\n1350\n00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:12,480\ndid type in, using that DFS util, it gives\nyou the ability to actually override\n\n1351\n00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,280\neven this bigger command, if you wanted\nto, by using DFS util cache, I think, and\n\n1352\n00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,570\nthen I think you can actually\nset what the number is.\n\n1353\n00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,340\nBut usually, this is where\nyou actually would set it up.\n\n1354\n00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:25,090\nSo that way, it actually does every so\noften go ahead and\n\n1355\n00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:28,015\nretrieve that name and\nnot keep that old stuff cached in.\n\n1356\n00:59:28,015 --> 00:59:28,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1357\n00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,340\n>> Is another place here.\n\n1358\n00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,145\n>> Yep.\n\n1359\n00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:34,670\nAllright, so we started out kind\nof focusing on the local side\n\n1360\n00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:35,420\nside of things\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1361\n00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,770\n>> So with our storage spaces,\nI can use that to protect our data.\n\n1362\n00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:42,810\nWe can have redundancy in,\nin case of you know, we, we lose a drive,\n\n1363\n00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:43,800\nwe can still retain that data.\n\n1364\n00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,099\nAnd then to get a little bit more\nadvanced, right, we have branch cache.\n\n1365\n00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:50,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Allright, so that we reach out locally.\n\n1366\n00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,930\nI guess not super locally,\nbut within our little site.\n\n1367\n00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> And gets in the cache content.\n\n1368\n00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,560\nAnd then now DFS, right,\nwhich is pretty sweet, you know, DFS.\n\n1369\n00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,530\nOf course, all this is all built in to,\nto Windows.\n\n1370\n01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,990\nIt's Roles and Windows server 2012.\n\n1371\n01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,120\nPretty fancy stuff.\n\n1372\n01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,775\nI think everybody should use DFS.\n\n1373\n01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:10,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So now we're kind of stepping.\n\n1374\n01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:15,320\nOutside of our domain for the last bit\nof data storage, which is SkyDrive.\n\n1375\n01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:15,980\n>> SkyDrive.\n\n1376\n01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,850\n>> Or OneDrive.\n\n1377\n01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:17,390\n>> OneDrive.\n\n1378\n01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,080\nYup.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1379\n01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,580\n>> So SkyDrive is the initial name for\n\n1380\n01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:25,320\nMicrosoft's way of doing cloud storage for\nus here.\n\n1381\n01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,020\nAnd, so, for this, us,\nthis technology has changed.\n\n1382\n01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,620\nSo since Windows 8 and Microsoft got sued,\nit's now called OneDrive.\n\n1383\n01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,360\n>> Hm.\n\n1384\n01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,890\n>> Even though everything is\nstill named SkyDrive here.\n\n1385\n01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:38,380\nSo, so\nyou might see both them on the exam.\n\n1386\n01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:41,200\nThere, there's no guarantee that\nyou're gonna see one over the other.\n\n1387\n01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,940\nSo just, kinda,\nrealize that that's what they mean whe,\n\n1388\n01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,680\nwhen they start talking about this here.\n\n1389\n01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,975\n'Kay?\nNow in Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, there's\n\n1390\n01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:54,290\nactually two, two particular ideas of\nSkyDrive that we have to be familiar with.\n\n1391\n01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:58,123\nThere's a regular SkyDrive and then\nevery once in a while you will actually\n\n1392\n01:00:58,123 --> 01:01:00,880\nsee something called SkyDrive Pro,\n\n1393\n01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,510\nokay, that you actually have there,\nfor us to do this.\n\n1394\n01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:05,190\nOkay.\n\n1395\n01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:08,680\nNow when we start taking,\nwe got both of those here, okay?\n\n1396\n01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:14,850\nBoth of those give us, gives us access to\nmore storage that we can actually access,\n\n1397\n01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:18,800\nbut the storage is normally\nlocated in the cloud or\n\n1398\n01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,000\ninside of a SharePoint storage space\nis where we would actually have it.\n\n1399\n01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,770\nOkay?\n\n1400\n01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:27,870\nIf you're using regular SkyDrive,\nokay, the,\n\n1401\n01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:31,760\nthe little icon that comes\nwith Windows 8 or 8.1 here.\n\n1402\n01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,260\nThat not only gives you\naccess to regular SkyDrive,\n\n1403\n01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:38,570\nwhich then connects you into the,\nthe cloud services.\n\n1404\n01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:44,060\nAnd that is designed for\na consumer class storage unit, right.\n\n1405\n01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:48,560\nRight now, you can actually go to, to the,\nthe OneDrive and you can sign up for\n\n1406\n01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,307\na free account and they'll give you\nseven gigs of storage space for free.\n\n1407\n01:01:52,307 --> 01:01:54,000\n'Kay?\nAnd you can actually use that in, and\n\n1408\n01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,770\noff, and you're ready to go.\n\n1409\n01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:59,110\nSo you know, once you have that,\n\n1410\n01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:02,800\nthat is your own storage space out there\non the cloud, which is perfectly fine.\n\n1411\n01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:09,140\nBut if you are running Office 365,\nin other words, Office, you know,\n\n1412\n01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:14,820\nthrough the cloud, or\nif you've actually purchased Office 2013,\n\n1413\n01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:18,990\nokay, one of the options that you\nactually did have when installing\n\n1414\n01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:21,620\nit is to install the idea\nof Sky Drive Pro.\n\n1415\n01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,500\nSky Drive Pro is not really\nconnecting to that one\n\n1416\n01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,540\nthat one drive storage space out there,\nin other words a consumer account.\n\n1417\n01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:35,710\nIt is really designed to connect\nto your own SharePoint services\n\n1418\n01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:39,630\nthat will then give you access to be\nable to store files up there instead.\n\n1419\n01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,400\nAnd then your entire organization\ncan actually use that, too.\n\n1420\n01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,810\nSo those are really where\nyou actually go for that.\n\n1421\n01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:50,079\nNow, that means that there's a lot of\nissues that can go along with this, right?\n\n1422\n01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:53,750\nThe issues that we have with the idea of\n\n1423\n01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,710\nstoring things in the SkyDrive\nis fairly simple.\n\n1424\n01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,920\nIt's the synchronization stuff, right?\n\n1425\n01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,120\nIf you delete something up on SkyDrive,\n\n1426\n01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,190\ncan it also delete something\non your hard drive as well?\n\n1427\n01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,330\nYeah, okay.\n\n1428\n01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:08,730\nSo if it actually is synchronizing up,\nthat's what will also end up happening.\n\n1429\n01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:11,610\nSo, I don't know if I should\nturn it back on, on my machine.\n\n1430\n01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:15,610\nI disabled it because I am on\na satellite internet connection now and\n\n1431\n01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:19,152\nSkyDrive synchronizes essentially\njust about every ten minutes.\n\n1432\n01:03:19,152 --> 01:03:19,700\nOkay?\n\n1433\n01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1434\n01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,350\n>> And I can't have that.\n\n1435\n01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:22,030\nI don't need that,\n\n1436\n01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:25,828\nthat idea of synchronizing every ten\nminutes over a satellite connection.\n\n1437\n01:03:25,828 --> 01:03:27,230\n>> Uh-hm.\n>> So I disabled it.\n\n1438\n01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:33,710\nBut, by default, let me see if it's\nactually back up on my computer here.\n\n1439\n01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:36,530\nYep, so when you actually do see it.\n\n1440\n01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:39,490\nOver here inside of the file explorer for\nus here,\n\n1441\n01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:43,550\n'kay, notice that I have this link\nthat says Skydrive right here.\n\n1442\n01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,270\nSo, inside the file explorer.\n\n1443\n01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:49,450\nAnd it just looks like just another\nlocation on my hard drive and there it is.\n\n1444\n01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:52,650\nThere are some some subfolders\nthat I have right there.\n\n1445\n01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:55,410\nAnd I can actually go right in and\nactually store things right there.\n\n1446\n01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,380\nAnd that doesn't look like I'm storing\nthem anywhere besides my local computer.\n\n1447\n01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,379\nBut I'm caching a copy here, and it's\nalso sending the copy to be synchronized\n\n1448\n01:04:03,379 --> 01:04:06,550\non SkyDrive, is what it's\nactually doing in the background.\n\n1449\n01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,514\nSo this is really natively designed,\nthis side of Windows 8.1,\n\n1450\n01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:12,190\nto be able to do this, okay?\n\n1451\n01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:16,740\nSo once it's actually there,\nyou really don't worry about it and\n\n1452\n01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,190\nyour applications tie right into it, okay?\n\n1453\n01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:26,040\nSo if I wanted to create a,\nlet's say a pow, let's do Excel.\n\n1454\n01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:32,670\nIf I wanted to create something\nin Excel here, use a blank\n\n1455\n01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:37,820\nworkbook and I do file,\nand then, let me save it.\n\n1456\n01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,940\nNotice I can actually go\nup to the one drive now.\n\n1457\n01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:42,410\nIt's actually, kind of converted here, and\n\n1458\n01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:45,375\nthat actually saves up there\nin the cloud for me, as well.\n\n1459\n01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,700\n'Kay, so I can save something up there and\n\n1460\n01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,580\nretrieve it directly and\nactually have it stored here.\n\n1461\n01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,360\nEverything that is\nsynchronized in one place, so\n\n1462\n01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:56,694\nI can go to any device that's out\nthere and be able to use this drive.\n\n1463\n01:04:56,694 --> 01:04:57,932\nSo it's fairly neat.\n\n1464\n01:04:57,932 --> 01:05:00,050\n>> Mm-hm.\nSo, when if you had a, well like a,\n\n1465\n01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:05,090\na service tablet or you know your one of\nthose one of those mobile phone, iPhone,\n\n1466\n01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:06,270\nI, it's that what you're gonna switch to?\n\n1467\n01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:06,910\nYou're next, Ronnie.\n\n1468\n01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,100\n>> You better believe it.\n\n1469\n01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,560\nI want the 86 megapixel camera-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1470\n01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,540\n>> On my my phone next.\n\n1471\n01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,870\n>> Ronnie, you take a lot of pictures?\n\n1472\n01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:14,945\n>> No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1473\n01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:15,900\n>> Oh, all right.\n\n1474\n01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,960\nYou just, just want it for\nthe numbers game?\n\n1475\n01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,260\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1476\n01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:19,780\n>> Nice.\n>> You know,\n\n1477\n01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,190\nthe larger the number, the better.\n\n1478\n01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:26,450\nExcept on Xbox 360, apparently Xbox one\nis better because its a smaller number.\n\n1479\n01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,270\nI dont get it.\n\n1480\n01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:34,570\nYeah, but sky drive for your personal use,\nyou use sky drive pretty extensively.\n\n1481\n01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:35,082\nI do.\n\n1482\n01:05:35,082 --> 01:05:40,950\nAll right, any reason you use it over,\nlets say Google drive or drop box?\n\n1483\n01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:41,900\nYes, there is.\n\n1484\n01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:42,700\nOh, okay.\n\n1485\n01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,310\nThe reason why i use it over that Its\nbecause at one time, they actually gave me\n\n1486\n01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:49,600\na time limit and said, hey Ronnie,\nif you will go back in and\n\n1487\n01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,055\nsign into your account that you\nessentially abandoned at this point.\n\n1488\n01:05:52,055 --> 01:05:54,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We will give\n\n1489\n01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,390\nyou 25 gigs of extra free space.\n\n1490\n01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:03,250\nI let 32 gigs sky drive account up there,\nI can't say everybody does, but I do.\n\n1491\n01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,190\nSo I use it.\n\n1492\n01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:04,700\n>> Hm.\n\n1493\n01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,400\n>> I really do.\n\n1494\n01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,350\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1495\n01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:07,670\n>> Have,\nhave you had any problems with it li,\n\n1496\n01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:11,210\nlike does it like when it syncs\nacross devices, does, I mean,\n\n1497\n01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:14,660\ndo you get any like bad files,\ncorrupted files, anything like that?\n\n1498\n01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:15,810\n>> Not yet.\n>> Mm-mm.\n\n1499\n01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:19,760\n>> Yeah, no, not yet, but I, I don't do\na lot of, I don't save a ton of stuff.\n\n1500\n01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,860\nI save things I normally, regularly do.\n\n1501\n01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:24,190\nSo again I work with documents,\nExcel files and stuff.\n\n1502\n01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,755\nStuff like that, but I do know someone,\n\n1503\n01:06:26,755 --> 01:06:31,430\nDon-he says, I'll never use it\nbecause it doesn't store XML files.\n\n1504\n01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:32,658\nSo there we go.\n\n1505\n01:06:32,658 --> 01:06:33,593\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1506\n01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:36,320\nthere are limitations\nbehind what we can do now.\n\n1507\n01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:40,200\nOne limitation I do want to mention is\nthat if you want to integrate like this,\n\n1508\n01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,290\nlike the way that I have it, where\nit's actually using your applications,\n\n1509\n01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:48,150\nyou do need to sign into your computer\nusing a Microsoft account, which, again,\n\n1510\n01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:52,110\nif you actually had Windows Live at\none point, if you created that or\n\n1511\n01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:55,210\na Hotmail account,\nit actually does work relatively well.\n\n1512\n01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:58,720\nAnd, so you can see in my upper\nright-hand corner a IM sign, that when,\n\n1513\n01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,560\nthat Microsoft Soft count.\n\n1514\n01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:04,360\nAnd that's how it actually has connected\nin, my entire that account right there,\n\n1515\n01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,770\nto be able to connect in.\n\n1516\n01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:06,620\nOkay?\n\n1517\n01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,650\nSo in terms of,\nof which one would you use?\n\n1518\n01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:14,160\nI have Skydrive pro, I have Skydrive.\n\n1519\n01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,910\nWell, if you are accessing your shared\nservices over a share point server,\n\n1520\n01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,350\nSkydrive pro is the way to go.\n\n1521\n01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:21,090\nOkay.\n\n1522\n01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:25,470\nIf you're accessing just your own personal\nstorage using the Microsoft account,\n\n1523\n01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,955\nyou can just use the regular SkyDrive,\nis what's gonna happen here.\n\n1524\n01:07:27,955 --> 01:07:29,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1525\n01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:33,220\nSo then so essentially, with with your\nSkyDrive storage, so you just added,\n\n1526\n01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,620\nhow much did you say you had?\n\n1527\n01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,490\n35?\n>> I have 32 gigs.\n\n1528\n01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,830\n>> 32 gigs.\nSo essentially,\n\n1529\n01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:40,165\nyou've expanded your hard\ndrive by 32 gigabytes.\n\n1530\n01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:41,890\n>> Mm-hm.\nBy saving and\n\n1531\n01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,450\naccessing data up there-\n>> Right.\n\n1532\n01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,580\n>> In you SkyDrive folder.\n\n1533\n01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:45,290\n>> Yup.\n>> Hm.\n\n1534\n01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:50,150\n>> And the, the ideas, again, is, is key\nfor me, because it means I don't have to\n\n1535\n01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:53,350\ncarry around an actual 32 gig\nthumbdrive a lot of times.\n\n1536\n01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:57,160\nIf I need to store files, I can actually\ngo up there, go to any computer,\n\n1537\n01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,300\nI can log in and especially if it's\na Windows A computer I can login with my\n\n1538\n01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:05,548\nMicrosoft account and gain access to\nwhen I need to just like I am here.\n\n1539\n01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,404\n>> Mm-hm nice.\n\n1540\n01:08:07,404 --> 01:08:08,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n1541\n01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:08,960\n>> Well, good deal.\n\n1542\n01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n1543\n01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,440\n>> All right Ronnie well\n>> Anything else to add for SkyDrive?\n\n1544\n01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:15,620\n>> Let's see.\n\n1545\n01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,140\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1546\n01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,000\n>> Remember the Microsoft,\n\n1547\n01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,490\nI'm trying to think of,\nremember the Microsoft account here, okay?\n\n1548\n01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:24,210\nRemember the differences between\nSkyDrive-Pro and the regular SkyDrive.\n\n1549\n01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:28,040\nNow, does that mean that people won't use\ntheir SkyDrive account even in businesses?\n\n1550\n01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,170\nNo, they'll use it.\n\n1551\n01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,540\n>> Owners tied to their own account.\n\n1552\n01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,860\nSo it's not tied to everybody, but\nyou do have the ability to go under and\n\n1553\n01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,110\nshare out files if you need to,\nas well, so\n\n1554\n01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:38,988\nthat you can actually let\nother users get access to it.\n\n1555\n01:08:38,988 --> 01:08:39,922\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1556\n01:08:39,922 --> 01:08:40,547\n>> Yeah.\n\n1557\n01:08:40,547 --> 01:08:42,230\n>> Yup.\nSo all right there you go.\n\n1558\n01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:45,550\nWe've got a number of ways\nto manage storage access,\n\n1559\n01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:49,480\nways to I guess it,\ntest it on the client's side of things.\n\n1560\n01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,460\nNow it, you know,\nin all these technologies may be other\n\n1561\n01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:56,370\nthan this sky drive that's, found a,\na lot there to, to diagnose with.\n\n1562\n01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:59,500\nIn a, with these technologies,\nthere is, there is so much more\n\n1563\n01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,620\nin depth that we can go with, with,\nwith branch cache in the server shows.\n\n1564\n01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:08,050\nAnd DFS and our server shows\nwe'll go even more in depth so\n\n1565\n01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:13,310\nif setting up this kind of technology\nis if you wanna set up in a test lab or\n\n1566\n01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,980\nroll it out for someone else then\ndefinitely jump over to the server shows\n\n1567\n01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:21,580\nand get down to the nitty gritty\non how to configure those devices.\n\n1568\n01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,250\n>> RIght.\n\n1569\n01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:25,540\nSo on these things right, again its for\n\n1570\n01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:28,470\nas a desktop support technician\n>> Being out offered\n\n1571\n01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,060\nthe solutions that need to be done.\n\n1572\n01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,740\nBeing out, at least, be you know, to start\nthe, the process of troubleshooting here,\n\n1573\n01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:37,770\nis pretty much the key in knowing\nwhat needs to be done next.\n\n1574\n01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:38,800\nWhether we're escalating or,\n\n1575\n01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,960\nwhether we're actually gonna troubleshoot\nfurther, is the key for us here.\n\n1576\n01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,100\nNow, yeah, I was trying to think.\n\n1577\n01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,330\nI did mention that we actually\nsigned in with a Microsoft account.\n\n1578\n01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:48,580\nI wanted to make sure\nthat I remembered that.\n\n1579\n01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:49,685\nYup.\nHere we go.\n\n1580\n01:09:49,685 -->

it is time to-\n>> Yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:57,847\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n43\n00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,317\n>> It is time.\n\n44\n00:01:59,317 --> 00:01:59,868\n>> Yep.\n\n45\n00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:04,400\n>> [LAUGH] So right down there,\nit's under 2.5.1.4.\n\n46\n00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,015\nAnd that is BitLocker and BitLocker To Go,\nand specifically about the Those.\n\n47\n00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:13,315\nWe have the Data Recovery Agent, and\n\n48\n00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:16,555\nMicrosoft BitLocker Administration and\nMonitoring.\n\n49\n00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:17,445\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n50\n00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:21,025\n>> Now for us here remember,\nwe're not going into to\n\n51\n00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:26,175\ntoo much in-depth about the process of\nBitLocker and locking things down here.\n\n52\n00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,135\nWe wanna talk about the, the idea here of,\n\n53\n00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:31,050\nreally the idea of recovery,\nmore than anything else.\n\n54\n00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,630\nNow we want to do a little bit of review,\n\n55\n00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,150\nmaking sure that we understand what\nthe concepts of BitLocker are and\n\n56\n00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,970\nBitLocker To Go, as well as actually\nthe idea of a data recovery agent.\n\n57\n00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,410\nAnd then we'll take a look at that last\none briefly when we talk about MBAM,\n\n58\n00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,030\nthe Microsoft Bit, BitLocker,\nAdministration and\n\n59\n00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,480\nManager or something like that.\n\n60\n00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,220\n>> And Monitoring.\n\n61\n00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,730\n>> Huh?\n\n62\n00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,330\n>> Monitoring.\n\n63\n00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,040\n>> Monitoring.\n\n64\n00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,860\nYeah, see.\n\n65\n00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,892\nSo you showed John,\nhow much I remembered out of that.\n\n66\n00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,380\n>> Man!\n[LAUGH] Man, yeah, I-\n\n67\n00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,270\n>> Is it monitoring?\n\n68\n00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> Managing, monitoring,\n\n69\n00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,740\n>> Administration and monitoring.\n\n70\n00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,300\n>> Administration and monitoring, yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,080\n>> Mm- hm.\n\n72\n00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,730\n>> I know, or you just say,\nM BAM for short.\n\n73\n00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,360\n>> Yeah, M BAM.\n\n74\n00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,500\nThat's why we Ya, so starting off,\nso what is bit locker.\n\n75\n00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,450\nNow, we have covered bit locker\nin the 687 objective and\n\n76\n00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,620\nbit locker it is essentially\njust whole disk encryption.\n\n77\n00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,910\nIt locks down.\n\n78\n00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,380\n>> If it if you use it with a TPN, then\nyou get the full bit locker experience,\n\n79\n00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,170\nwhere it can protect the boot process, and\n\n80\n00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,010\nkeep those root kits\nfrom getting in there.\n\n81\n00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,565\nIf it detects some change\nduring the boot process,\n\n82\n00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:39,755\nIt'll lock it down tight,\nrequiring a 48 digit key to unlock it,\n\n83\n00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:45,305\nor you can get a recovery agent involved,\nwe'll tough into that in a little bit.\n\n84\n00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:48,540\nAnd if you do not have a TPN,\nyou can still use bit locker,\n\n85\n00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,960\nwe'll need a startup password or\nsome kind of startup key.\n\n86\n00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,910\nWhich could be a USB drive that has\nthat startup,uh, key file on it.\n\n87\n00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,970\n>> Yeah, so in,\nin terms of BitLocker, right.\n\n88\n00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,620\nHopefully you've encountered it by now.\n\n89\n00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,590\nYou've go through the 687 show.\n\n90\n00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,580\nAnd you understand what it really\ndoes here in terms of hard drive.\n\n91\n00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,840\nIt encrypts the entire hard drive.\n\n92\n00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,740\nNow, if you're again, new to this process,\nand you're probably wondering like, well\n\n93\n00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,640\nI understand as an individual, why we need\nto encrypt the entire hard drive here.\n\n94\n00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,210\nBut why in the world would\na business need to do it as well?\n\n95\n00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,260\nAnd that is because, once again,\nbusiness data is fairly important.\n\n96\n00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,530\nIt just like your data is, and\nthere's a lot more of it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,970\nSo what we can actually do in terms\nof regular business networks here,\n\n98\n00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,980\nis to go ahead and\nactually use this technology\n\n99\n00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,800\nto help encrypt drives such as on laptops\nand even on regular desktops here.\n\n100\n00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,500\nBut even they would BitLocker\nto go we could even do it on\n\n101\n00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,330\nportable removable drives as well, okay?\n\n102\n00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,510\nNow for us the idea is simple.\n\n103\n00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,310\nIt is a protection, it is a security\nimplementation that we can put in place\n\n104\n00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,160\nthat really does help us to secure devices\nthat are actually going to be exposed at\n\n105\n00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,620\nsome time,\nusually outside of our network, right?\n\n106\n00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,900\nSo for example, on my laptop, if I take\nmy laptop off my network here, and\n\n107\n00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,620\nI happen to leave it somewhere and\nsomebody ends up taking it.\n\n108\n00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,660\nWell, if the laptop has now\nbeen taken off network and\n\n109\n00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,010\nI've shut it down, when they go to\nrestart it, bitlocker protects the drive.\n\n110\n00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,940\nWhen they go and launch back up it's gonna\nask them to either put in that recovery\n\n111\n00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,010\nkey like we said, or\nwe can have it automatically open OK\n\n112\n00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,970\nby using just that TPM\nchip that Nate mentioned.\n\n113\n00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,510\nOr I can actually recover a PIN number or\na password,\n\n114\n00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,890\nor whatever it is here that actually\nrequires them to enter something else in\n\n115\n00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,160\nbefore the drive is actually usable.\n\n116\n00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,830\nSo, bit locker is actually\na protection for us, really if\n\n117\n00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,240\nthe computer gets turned off and then\nsomebody tries to access the drive again.\n\n118\n00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,500\nNow in terms of a regular hard\ndrive on the computer right,\n\n119\n00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,740\nwhat if somebody If somebody\nwere to come into my network and\n\n120\n00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,460\nactually just grab a bunch of\nhard drives out of computers.\n\n121\n00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,190\nOkay?\n\n122\n00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,090\nAnd they just grabbed them.\n\n123\n00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,840\nThey thought they could actually later on\ntake them to their own computer and slave\n\n124\n00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,710\nthem in so that they could actually browse\nthe drives and pull files off of them.\n\n125\n00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,590\nBitLocker, again, still protects\nthose types of drives as well, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,600\nSo, there is our basic why we would\nactually want to use it, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,880\nAnd for us the technology that Microsoft\nprefers that you use, with Windows 8.1,\n\n128\n00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,020\nis gonna be the use of bitlocker, as well\nas the use of bitlocker to go, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,410\nSo, these are the two\nthat we actually have.\n\n130\n00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,880\nNow, most users really do not have\na problem using the ID of bitlocker.\n\n131\n00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,570\nIt seems perfectly fine, okay, and good\n\n132\n00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,790\nuntil maybe technology changes and they\nmay set the device down for a week or so.\n\n133\n00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,870\nAnd all the sudden now they have a drive,\nthey go you wanna know something?\n\n134\n00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,480\nI can't remember how to\nget into that drive.\n\n135\n00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,020\nOkay?\n\n136\n00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,980\nAnd that's where we actually\nare finding a lot of our issues here.\n\n137\n00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,990\nIs that sometimes they\njust don't remember, or\n\n138\n00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,860\nthey don't actually have the right things.\n\n139\n00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,380\nFor example, if your bit locker\nactually requires you to have a USB key\n\n140\n00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,280\nthat unlocks the computer, then what\nhappens when I misplace that, that key.\n\n141\n00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,450\n>> Then you'll have\na difficult time opening it up.\n\n142\n00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> And if you don't have the key,\n\n143\n00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,550\nthen you forget the password right?\n\n144\n00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,070\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n145\n00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,630\n>> And-\n>> A forty-eight digit password.\n\n146\n00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,720\n>> Yeah, and, and you know I would have\nput that 48 digit password someplace\n\n147\n00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,650\nsafe if I've misplaced that key.\n\n148\n00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,170\nYou know it's absolutely safe.\n\n149\n00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,180\nIt's so safe that I can't even find it.\n\n150\n00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,610\n>> Right.\nSo, it's so\n\n151\n00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,920\nsafe that you stored it\non your bit locker drive.\n\n152\n00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,290\n>> That's righ,t I stored\nit on the bit locker drive.\n\n153\n00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,010\nThat's true.\n\n154\n00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,800\nYeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n155\n00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,810\n>> So, we wanna talk about\nsome of those issues and\n\n156\n00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,330\nhow we can actually recover\n>> from things like that as well, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,950\nSo, how should we begin, Nate?\n\n158\n00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,940\nDo, do you just want to take a look,\nor what, what do you want to do?\n\n159\n00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,240\nYeah.\nSo, you know, we,\n\n160\n00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,010\nwe could start off by just spit lockering\nthe drive, we just start the process from\n\n161\n00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,080\nthe beginning\n>> Okay.\n\n162\n00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,010\n>> We'll just create a scenario.\n\n163\n00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,510\nOkay?\n>> Yeah.\n\n164\n00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,060\n>> So, we have a, a laptop.\n\n165\n00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,630\nShould we bitlocker this one?\n\n166\n00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,460\n>> Let's bitlocker.\n\n167\n00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,800\nYeah, we,\nwe can bitlocker your laptop, sure.\n\n168\n00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n169\n00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,960\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n170\n00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,840\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n171\n00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,922\nRight now.\n\n172\n00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:01,920\n>> Sure.\nLet's, let's do it.\n\n173\n00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,500\n>> Okay.\n\n174\n00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,170\nMm-hm.\n\n175\n00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,273\n>> So let's show the process of actually\ndoing the BitLocker and then we'll go\n\n176\n00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:09,315\nthrough and talk about what happens\nif Nate has forgotten his processor.\n\n177\n00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:09,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n178\n00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,530\n>> All right, well good deal.\n\n179\n00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:17,260\nWell, in that case, so this laptop\nhere does have a TPM inside of it.\n\n180\n00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,350\nAnd, yeah, so it is joined to a domain.\n\n181\n00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,530\nSo we will get into a, a data recovery\nagent, here in a, in a minute.\n\n182\n00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,480\nSo we are pulling those policies down.\n\n183\n00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,030\nAnd, you know, it,\n\n184\n00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,710\nit should be pretty safe\n>> Mm-hm\n\n185\n00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,820\n>> Just to bitlock of this guy.\n\n186\n00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,230\nHope it doesn't mess with any\nof these screen-sharing stuff.\n\n187\n00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,592\nOh, it's been messed with.\n\n188\n00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, to do that.\n\n189\n00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,680\nSo we won't sorry about\nme encrypting this.\n\n190\n00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,990\nThis is another yeah, another little deal,\nso we won't worry about that.\n\n191\n00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,490\nAll right.\n\n192\n00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,845\nSo, this one on our C drive or\nthis Turn on BitLocker,\n\n193\n00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,165\nand just go through and-\n>> Yeah.\n\n194\n00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:56,925\n>> Just check the configuration to make\nsure that it is possible to BitLocker.\n\n195\n00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:57,665\nAnd it looks good.\n\n196\n00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:02,972\nSo, let us proceed and,\nstuff with backing up and that's fine.\n\n197\n00:09:02,972 --> 00:09:11,025\n[SOUND] All right, preparing the drive,\ngetting all the stuff ready.\n\n198\n00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,136\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All ight, and we'll click,\n\n199\n00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,280\nyou know what?\n\n200\n00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,850\n>> What?\n\n201\n00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,630\n>> So, we'll have to drop out of here for\na second.\n\n202\n00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,380\nIt will want to restart.\n\n203\n00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,880\n>> Yup.\n\n204\n00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,024\nAll right, yeah, let's talk about those\noptions before we, we restart and\n\n205\n00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,187\neverything else.\n\n206\n00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:24,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, yup.\n\n207\n00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,040\nAll right.\n\n208\n00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,145\nSo we've got these,\nthese three options, right?\n\n209\n00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:29,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To, to save our,\n\n210\n00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,980\nour BitLocker recovery key.\n\n211\n00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,950\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> Right?\n\n212\n00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,780\nSo.\n\n213\n00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,590\nBut, yeah.\n\n214\n00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,990\nOn, oh, how to unlock on, on startup.\n\n215\n00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n216\n00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,500\nAll right, so I guess a PIN, right?\n\n217\n00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,710\nA PIN, yeah,\nsome four digit number that we can put in.\n\n218\n00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,910\nA USB flashdrive for our key.\n\n219\n00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,581\nOr we can let BitLocker automatically\nunlock the drive All right?\n\n220\n00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:52,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n221\n00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,130\n>> So what do you think, Ryan?\n\n222\n00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,420\nJust let it unlock it?\n\n223\n00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,240\n>> Sure.\n\n224\n00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,050\n>> All right.\n\n225\n00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,360\nAnd so now, we either save this save\nthis key to a USB drive, all right,\n\n226\n00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360\nsave it to a file or\nprint out this recovery key.\n\n227\n00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,960\nNow, So, so I, yeah I was looking at it,\nit's, it's kind of striking me a little\n\n228\n00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,060\nfunny, I guess,\nyou know it says join to a, a domain.\n\n229\n00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,890\nIf this does not join a domain and you\nwere logged in with a Microsoft account,\n\n230\n00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,930\nthen you would have the option to save\nyour key to you Microsoft account.\n\n231\n00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,200\nWhich is, I mean,\nto me it is very convenient.\n\n232\n00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,710\n>> Right.\n\n233\n00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,340\n>> It's safely stored up there and\nif you ever mess anything up you can just\n\n234\n00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,730\nlog in there and\nyou can pull that key down.\n\n235\n00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,250\nAll right.\nWe'll just go and\n\n236\n00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,077\nsave this to a file on the desktop.\n\n237\n00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:33,270\n[LAUGH]\n>> Maybe not.\n\n238\n00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:33,850\n>> Okay.\n\n239\n00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,810\nAll right.\n\n240\n00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,330\nThen, in that case, we'll save it\nto that other, that other drive.\n\n241\n00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,510\nGames, not sure what's in there.\n\n242\n00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,410\nDut dut dum.\n\n243\n00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,100\nAll right.\n\n244\n00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,100\nLooks good.\n>> Yup.\n\n245\n00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,880\n>> All right.\n\n246\n00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,870\nWe'll click on Next right here.\n\n247\n00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,700\nRight.\nEncrypt used disk space only.\n\n248\n00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,310\nNow, this is something new\nwith BitLocker for Windows 8.\n\n249\n00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,320\nOf course, you know,\nit carries over to Windows 8.1,\n\n250\n00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,660\nis BitLocker can only encrypt,\nwell, two options.\n\n251\n00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,070\nIt can Going to encrypt everything.\n\n252\n00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,400\nSo the entire C drive,\nfrom beginning to end.\n\n253\n00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,580\nOr you can only encrypt the used space, so\n\n254\n00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,750\nwith all that free space hanging\nout there won't encrypt it.\n\n255\n00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,160\nOne of the benefits to it, well,\nit saves on a lot of time.\n\n256\n00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,390\nSay you have a gigantic 4 terabyte drive,\nyou install windows on it.\n\n257\n00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,300\nNow you want a bit locker on it.\n\n258\n00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,030\nIt'll take over night, maybe the whole\nday I guess depending on the processor,\n\n259\n00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,530\nto encrypt that entire four terabytes.\n\n260\n00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:39,000\nWell, if you only encrypt the used disk\nspace, then it could take ten, 20 minutes.\n\n261\n00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,260\n>> And so for this demo,\nthat's what we will, and, do.\n\n262\n00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,110\nWe will just chose the disk space,\nclick on next.\n\n263\n00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,540\nAll right, and we're ready to encrypt\nthe drive and we'll click on continue.\n\n264\n00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,110\nAnd here shortly, dut dut dun.\n\n265\n00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,050\nAll right so it says that,\nthe computer must be restarted and\n\n266\n00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,600\nit will begin the blocker process.\n\n267\n00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,290\n>> Yeah.\n\n268\n00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,130\nNow this process does take\na little bit of time, right?\n\n269\n00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,120\nThe longer the drive,\nthe more data that's on it,\n\n270\n00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,920\nthe longer it's gonna\nactually take to encrypt.\n\n271\n00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,910\n'Kay?\n\n272\n00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,180\nSo, let's go ahead and\nrestart the process, and what,\n\n273\n00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,700\nwe'll talk about it from\na different standpoint as well.\n\n274\n00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,310\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n275\n00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,250\n>> So, as this process restarts for,\nfor Nate, we're gonna also go ahead and\n\n276\n00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,670\nshow you one in which the computer\nis not joined to the domain as well.\n\n277\n00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,300\nIs what we're going to show you too.\n\n278\n00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,410\nOkay?\nSo, if I.\n\n279\n00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,910\nLooks like I dropped again.\n\n280\n00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,800\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Let me send it on here, okay?\n\n281\n00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,430\nSo, as my software is dropping in and\n\n282\n00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,300\nout hopefully we'll be able to stay up,\nif not.\n\n283\n00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,830\nMy computer is not joined to the domain.\n\n284\n00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,950\nBut I want to talk about the idea\nof using Bitlocker to go.\n\n285\n00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,590\nRemember that this is actually for\nthings like thumb drives,\n\n286\n00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,990\nand, and portable drives here,\nthat are going to be removed.\n\n287\n00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,710\nNow these are actually kind of,\npesky to manage, right?\n\n288\n00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,910\nIn an organization where you might\nhave signed out fifty or a hundred or\n\n289\n00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,180\nmaybe a thousand of these things, right?\n\n290\n00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,100\nYes you need to be able to encrypt\nthat data that's actually on it, and\n\n291\n00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,960\nwe're actually gonna even take a look at\nsome of the ways we can restrict that.\n\n292\n00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,180\nI think we did that in the other show,\ndidn't we?\n\n293\n00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,280\n>> Where, where we,\nyeah we did this in another show,\n\n294\n00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,480\nwhere we actually showed you\nwhere you could limit those, what\n\n295\n00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,780\ntypes of drives are actually in there,\n>> But for\n\n296\n00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,410\nus here, we wanna go through this process,\nas well so that we can see that too.\n\n297\n00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,030\nNow instead of me actually encrypting\nthe entire drive and having to reboot,\n\n298\n00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,078\non my machine I have a thumbdrive\nthat's actually available to me.\n\n299\n00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,370\nAnd I right-click on that,\n\n300\n00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,550\nit's as simple as actually\nselecting that turn-on BitLocker.\n\n301\n00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,630\nSo this is a neat process for us.\n\n302\n00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,930\n>> in which we can right click\non the drive and go ahead and\n\n303\n00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,950\nenable the BitLocker here.\n\n304\n00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,470\nAnd notice it asks me how I want\nto actually unlock that drive.\n\n305\n00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,550\nAnd it gives me two options here, right?\n\n306\n00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,950\nThe ability to unlock the drive using\na password, or if I actually have some\n\n307\n00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,910\nhardware device, such as a smart card\nto be able to to do this as well.\n\n308\n00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,489\nOkay.\nSo I 'm just gonna choose a password here\n\n309\n00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,230\nAnd then, I'm going to click next.\n\n310\n00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,770\nAnd from this, notice that I have a couple\nof different options that I can have.\n\n311\n00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,410\nOkay?\n\n312\n00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,230\nThe most secure way to do this, of course.\n\n313\n00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,580\nI shouldn't say the most secure way.\n\n314\n00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,740\nThe.\nProbably the.\n\n315\n00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,420\n>> Most convenient.\n\n316\n00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,530\n>> The most convenient way is\nprobably the best, answer here.\n\n317\n00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,248\n>> Is to save it to the Microsoft account,\nbecause that's stored out in Microsoft's\n\n318\n00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:23,650\nnetwork somewhere, 'kay, wherever my pick\nor Microsoft account is actually stored.\n\n319\n00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,590\nAnd that means that as long as I\ncan get access to that account and\n\n320\n00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,180\nI have this drive,\nI should be able to unlock this drive.\n\n321\n00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,850\nSo that's probably the best way to do it.\n\n322\n00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,440\nOkay?\n\n323\n00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,830\nThe most convenient way.\n\n324\n00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,730\nI can save it to a file.\n\n325\n00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,760\nHey, I can't sign on to the account\nbecause I'm not logged on with that.\n\n326\n00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,840\nSave to a file here,\nwhich again is another one or\n\n327\n00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,570\nI can actually print\nthe recovery key right now.\n\n328\n00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,210\nAnd then make sure that I store that.\n\n329\n00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,000\nIf I save it to a file or a print recovery\nkey, I want to make sure that I store\n\n330\n00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,410\nthat in a secure location,\nthat I can always retrieve it.\n\n331\n00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,670\nDon't store it in a location that's so\nsecure,\n\n332\n00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,620\nyou can't remember where the location is.\n\n333\n00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,160\nOkay?\n\n334\n00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,680\nHere's what we have.\n\n335\n00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,050\nSo, again, I'm just going to do\nthe save to a file here, and\n\n336\n00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,210\nI'm going to save it to another drive.\n\n337\n00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,560\nJust like, what Nate did.\n\n338\n00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,164\nOh, I can't use that location apparently.\n\n339\n00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:11,676\nSure, let's save it to\nthe My Documents folder.\n\n340\n00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:14,048\nWhy not?\n\n341\n00:15:14,048 --> 00:15:19,540\n[LAUGH]\nYup.\n\n342\n00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,650\nAnd then we click Next.\n\n343\n00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,690\nAnd once again,\nit's gonna ask the same options, okay?\n\n344\n00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,020\nAnd that's only an eight-gig stick.\n\n345\n00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,050\nI'm not so worried about it so\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n346\n00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,300\njust encrypt the drive space.\n\n347\n00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,460\nAnd from there I'm gonna start encrypting\nit and it's not gonna take long.\n\n348\n00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,700\nYou can see right away,\nas now encrypting here, and\n\n349\n00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,640\nthat is complete cuz there's nothing on\nthis drive, it gives me the little icon\n\n350\n00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,550\nthat I have right here and\nthen we are ready We're good to go okay.\n\n351\n00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,690\nSo in this instance here, what happens\nwith me especially on thumb drives right,\n\n352\n00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,490\nis I have several of these,\nI have three or four of these.\n\n353\n00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,250\n>> Man, rich guy.\n\n354\n00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:56,820\n>> Yeah I know.\n\n355\n00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,880\nThese I probably bought like five or\nsix years ago.\n\n356\n00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,770\nAnd [LAUGH] I have several of\nthese in which this particular\n\n357\n00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,920\noptions sounds good Until I\ndon't use it for weeks.\n\n358\n00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,590\nRight?\n\n359\n00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,320\nAnd then I go and plug that\nthumbdrive in after I pull it out.\n\n360\n00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,085\nWell, that's where I would actually\nhave a problem at this point.\n\n361\n00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:19,430\nSo that is an issue when we actually\nstart doing something like that.\n\n362\n00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,940\nOkay?\n\n363\n00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,730\nSo right now as long as\nthe computer is actually up and\n\n364\n00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,670\noperating, notice the drive\nis actually unlocked.\n\n365\n00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,520\nAnd you can see that little unlock key.\n\n366\n00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,360\nSo we're perfectly fine here.\n\n367\n00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,568\nUntil that drive is removed, and\nthen I actually plug it back in again.\n\n368\n00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:33,688\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n369\n00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,363\nYup.\n\n370\n00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:35,040\n>> Yup.\n\n371\n00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,940\n>> Alright, so on this machine here,\nwe got it restarted.\n\n372\n00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,010\nAnd it's slowly grinding away.\n\n373\n00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,840\n>> Yup.\n>> So it's moving along at a decent pace.\n\n374\n00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,330\n>> Yup.\n\n375\n00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,430\nYeah.\nWe should probably,\n\n376\n00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,060\nit'll probably be up here in a little bit,\nready to keep going on it.\n\n377\n00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,020\n>> Just a tad bit of time\nhere as we do this, okay?\n\n378\n00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,740\nSo the key is simple for us, right?\n\n379\n00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,060\nOn an individual computer,\n\n380\n00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,910\nnotice the options that you\nhave available to you, right?\n\n381\n00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,420\nIn most scenarios, especially if\nyou're on a stand alone computer,\n\n382\n00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,570\nthe best bet is to actually have them,\nokay, for convenience sake and\n\n383\n00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,470\nfor storage sake, is to store them in\na particular Microsoft account, okay?\n\n384\n00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,090\nThat again allows them to take that\nthumb drive anywhere that they want to.\n\n385\n00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,670\nYou can access the Microsoft Drive\naccount, they can actually go ahead at\n\n386\n00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,520\nthat point here, and be able to recover\nthat instance of that thumb drive for us.\n\n387\n00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,810\nAlright?\n\n388\n00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,410\nNow, let's see.\n\n389\n00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,430\nYeah, so we're still encrypting.\n\n390\n00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,260\nThat's what we're doing?\n\n391\n00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,320\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n392\n00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,620\nSo there's gonna be a couple of different\nways that this is going to happen.\n\n393\n00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,060\nLet me go ahead and, yeah,\nthe only thing I actually have left to do\n\n394\n00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,420\nis to restart this thing so I can actually\nsee what happens when I disconnect this.\n\n395\n00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,780\nNow, that's not a real thumb drive,\n\n396\n00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,830\nit's a virtual thumb drive which is\nactually not exactly the, the same thing.\n\n397\n00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,160\nBut let's see what happens when\nI reboot the computer here.\n\n398\n00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,260\nOh no, I don't have the option,\nit's gonna update no matter what.\n\n399\n00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,950\nOh, all right.\n\n400\n00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,160\nAll right.\n\n401\n00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,520\nSo as the computer actually reboots then,\nwhat should happen is that that drive\n\n402\n00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,000\ndisconnects, okay, and\nthen when it tries to connect back in,\n\n403\n00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,320\nit's gonna require a pin\nnumber if I want to use it.\n\n404\n00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,465\nOkay?\nIs what's gonna happen.\n\n405\n00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:28,820\nAnd so, yeah, that's gonna take\na little bit of time for us as well.\n\n406\n00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,435\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n407\n00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:32,295\n>> So, at this point here,\nwhat we can do is we can go ahead and\n\n408\n00:18:32,295 --> 00:18:34,065\njust take a brief break right now and\nwe'll,\n\n409\n00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,115\nwe'll extend this to the\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n410\n00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,610\n>> Second segment out a little bit longer.\n\n411\n00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And we'll come back yeah.\n\n412\n00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,510\nSo you don't have to wait for our TV-\n>> Yeah, it has\n\n413\n00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,055\n>> Or updating here.\n\n414\n00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:46,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n415\n00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:46,810\nYep.\n\n416\n00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,880\nSounded great, Ronnie.\n\n417\n00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,200\n>> Sounds good.\n\n418\n00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,900\n>> More BitLocker stuff\nthen after the break.\n\n419\n00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,334\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back.\n\n420\n00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:01,064\nAll right, so like five minutes, right?\n\n421\n00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:06,334\n[CROSSTALK] After we broke at it went from\nlike 55 to 60 and then it finished up, so.\n\n422\n00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:07,284\n>> Yeah.\n\n423\n00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:07,980\nAll right.\nSo, yes.\n\n424\n00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,170\nSo, now the computer,\nBitLocker finished, everything is good,\n\n425\n00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,240\nand encryption of C is complete,\nso we're able to use it.\n\n426\n00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,015\nSo, it's not, it's not all hosed up.\n\n427\n00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:18,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n428\n00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,395\n>> That is a good thing.\n\n429\n00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:23,385\nSo the, ta, ta, ta, we close that out\nbecause we'll look at that somewhere else.\n\n430\n00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:28,385\nAnd then open this up and so sure enough,\nnow on CGI, we've got the little lock, and\n\n431\n00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,340\nit's grey.\n\n432\n00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,705\nIt's, the shackle is open,\nand it's an unlocked drive.\n\n433\n00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:36,915\nAnd when you click, right-click and\nchoose Manage BitLocker\n\n434\n00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:40,715\njust to get a little menu here,\nso BitLocker is turned on.\n\n435\n00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:41,395\nIt is unlocked.\n\n436\n00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,670\nAnd we can suspend protection.\n\n437\n00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,380\nPerhaps if we are going to be doing\nsomething else to this computer to where\n\n438\n00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,690\nwe know it could kind of screw\nup some of the boot process,\n\n439\n00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,710\nor something that will invoke BitLocker\nthinking, hey, I'm being tampered with.\n\n440\n00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,050\nI'm going to lock this computer down.\n\n441\n00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,440\nIf we know we're going to be\ndoing something like that, or\n\n442\n00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,605\ncould, we can suspend the protection, and\nit'll temporarily turn off BitLocker.\n\n443\n00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now it won't decrypt the drive.\n\n444\n00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,280\n>> Right.\n\n445\n00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,590\n>> But it just won't be monitoring for\nany of that stuff.\n\n446\n00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,960\n>> Yep.\n\n447\n00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,340\n>> Then we change how the drive\nis unlocked at startup.\n\n448\n00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,990\nWe can backup the recovery key again,\nand this turn off BitLocker will\n\n449\n00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,110\nessentially just be decrypt\nthe hard drive and just turn off.\n\n450\n00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,890\n>> Yeah\n>> Mhmm\n\n451\n00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,795\n>> Now for us here,\n\n452\n00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:29,034\nremember that sometimes you do\nactually have to go ahead and\n\n453\n00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:32,030\nturn off BitLocker and\nthen turn it back on.\n\n454\n00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,500\nIf you were having to.\n\n455\n00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,800\nI was trying to think of that scenario,\nand I can't remember what I was about to\n\n456\n00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,293\nsay here, but a lot of times it, if you\nactually know, let's say that you have now\n\n457\n00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:47,008\nofficially lost your recovery key, but the\ngood thing is you're still in the drive.\n\n458\n00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:50,440\nAnd you can actually get it back if you\ncan't back up your recovery key and\n\n459\n00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,590\nget it again for one reason or\nanother, you may actually just go and\n\n460\n00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,797\nturn off the Bitlocker here, and\nthen just re-encrypt it again and\n\n461\n00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,176\nthat way you will actually\nget a new recovery key.\n\n462\n00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,916\nAnd so if you think someone has tampered\nwith your key and they have it,\n\n463\n00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,210\nyou might wanna actually be\nable to do things like that.\n\n464\n00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,980\nSo sometimes, you do have to actually do\nthat where you turn it off and then turn\n\n465\n00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,995\nit back on, if you think that a keys been\ncompromised at some point in time as well.\n\n466\n00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,260\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Yep.\n\n467\n00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,770\n>> Yep.\n\n468\n00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,160\nNow there is a command line-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n469\n00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,670\n>> Tool that we-\n>> Okay.\n\n470\n00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,190\n>> We'll get into.\n\n471\n00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,580\nIt's here in a minute.\n\n472\n00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,070\nIt's called manage dash BDE.\n\n473\n00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now there are some switches in there\n\n474\n00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,630\nthat can reset the password.\n\n475\n00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,200\n>> Right.\n\n476\n00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,790\n>> And a few others reset a key and\nget a new key.\n\n477\n00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,420\nNow, I haven't used it a whole lot,\nand if I,\n\n478\n00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,530\nI can't, if I have lost my recovery key,\nor, you know, and,\n\n479\n00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,200\nthe thing is unlocked, sure there is a\ncommand line and there is a switch Story.\n\n480\n00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,530\nYou can reset it-\n>> Yeah.\n\n481\n00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,570\n>> Without decrypting it,\nbut, you know, for\n\n482\n00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,410\nthat, that surefire you know-\n>> Way.\n\n483\n00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,070\n>> Me, personally,\n\n484\n00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,360\nyes, I would, I would decrypt it-\n>> Yup.\n\n485\n00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,170\n>> And get a brand new key and\n\n486\n00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,600\nstart fresh all over again-\n>> Yeah.\n\n487\n00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,660\n>> Cuz you're relying on that well-\n>> Yeah.\n\n488\n00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,550\n>> It's, it's possible.\n\n489\n00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,570\n>> Yup.\nAnd don't forget.\n\n490\n00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,200\nYou might go, well how the heck would I\nre, if I can't remember the recovery key,\n\n491\n00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,810\nhow am I gonna remember that command line?\n\n492\n00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,980\nWell, those command\nlines are actually done\n\n493\n00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,480\n>> So that we can script those out\n\n494\n00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,690\nas computer administrators or\nnetwork administrators here.\n\n495\n00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,010\nI may choose instead to create\na script off of that command line, and\n\n496\n00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,330\nthen I email that script over\nto whoever needs it, and\n\n497\n00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,200\nthen they can run it on their machine and\nbe ready to go.\n\n498\n00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,770\nOkay?\n\n499\n00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,040\nBut a lot of times for\nus the easiest way is to do that.\n\n500\n00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,820\nSo you do know that something is\ngonna change on your computer.\n\n501\n00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,670\nSo the, the example that I was really\nthinking of was right here, right?\n\n502\n00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,120\nLet's say that on your computer,\n\n503\n00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,330\ninstead what ends up happening here,\nis that you upgrade some drive component.\n\n504\n00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,810\nOr, let's say you upgrade\nyour processor or something.\n\n505\n00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,500\nWell if you do that, right, remember that\nif you're running on a computer using\n\n506\n00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:51,490\nthe TPM, that Trusted Platform Module,\nthat's gonna re-key that TPM for us.\n\n507\n00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,848\nAnd change the hash value that's on it.\n\n508\n00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:58,170\nAnd now BitLocker's going to recognize\nthe computer as something new,\n\n509\n00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,170\nnot as the original computer.\n\n510\n00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,330\nSo before you actually do that, what you\nmay want to do is if you know when you're\n\n511\n00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:09,620\ngoing to upgrade your computer's hardware\ninstead, is you wanna turn BitLocker off,\n\n512\n00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,880\ndo the upgrades that you need to,\nreboot the computer, come back in, and\n\n513\n00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,458\nthen re-enable BitLocker when we need to,\nokay.\n\n514\n00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,289\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n515\n00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:22,045\nSo that That may be the effective way to,\nto do that in terms of what happens there.\n\n516\n00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n517\n00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,690\nAll right now so we have, so\n\n518\n00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,410\nthere are a number of policies-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n519\n00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,030\n>> That control the BitLocker and, and how\nwe can force up that data recovery agent,\n\n520\n00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,020\nhow we can have our keys\nsaved in to active directory.\n\n521\n00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,430\n>> Yep.\n>> That we can take a look at.\n\n522\n00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,010\nAnd right, should we do it now?\n\n523\n00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,200\n>> Let's do it.\n>> Want to jump in now?\n\n524\n00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,760\n>> Yep.\n\n525\n00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,490\n>> All right.\n\n526\n00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,714\nSo, for those policies, you do have that\n\n527\n00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:53,939\nsaved up onto a domain controller, and so\n\n528\n00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:58,884\nwe'll just, uh-huh, not that guy.\n\n529\n00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:03,192\n>> And this guy,\n\n530\n00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:07,504\n5.21 Hm.\n\n531\n00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:18,834\nAll right.\n\n532\n00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:25,690\n[COUGH] Now, for those policies, so, yes,\nhere we are in Window Search and 12R2.\n\n533\n00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,430\nAnd I want to jump into our\ngroup policy management.\n\n534\n00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,920\nOpen this guy up, dut dut dun.\n\n535\n00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,130\nAll right.\n\n536\n00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,180\nAnd so our group policy objects and\nBitLocker, we'll just go ahead and\n\n537\n00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,160\nedit this policy, and\n\n538\n00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,220\nwe'll take a look at some of those Paul\nsays that we can set to control BitLocker.\n\n539\n00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,237\nAll right,\nunder computer configuration and\n\n540\n00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:57,190\nin policies and\nadministrative templates and\n\n541\n00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,080\nin windows components,\nwe've got this guy right here.\n\n542\n00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,900\nBitLocker drive encryption.\n\n543\n00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,555\nNow there are a number of BitLocker\npolicies and they're organized.\n\n544\n00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:10,695\nThat we got some basic ones.\n\n545\n00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:14,300\nYour kind of cover all,\nall different types down here.\n\n546\n00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,655\nAnd we have fix data drives.\n\n547\n00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:17,415\nThese are for like,\n\n548\n00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:20,165\nif you have extra hard drives\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n549\n00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:21,395\n>> Stuck into a computer.\n\n550\n00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:25,495\nOperating system drives, which, you know,\ntypically would be the C drive.\n\n551\n00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:29,816\nAnd removable data drives for\nthumb drives and USB drives.\n\n552\n00:25:29,816 --> 00:25:33,699\nIt's also right there.\n\n553\n00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,656\nNow, for, to use a data recovery agent,\n\n554\n00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:39,635\nthere is a number of set-up items in\n>> Right.\n\n555\n00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:40,400\n>> there.\n\n556\n00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,590\nAnd we won't go through the whole\nset up we, you know, Ryan and\n\n557\n00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,760\nI, we set up the data recovery\nagent beforehand, and so\n\n558\n00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,498\nwe won't go through every single little\nstep on how to do it, right now but\n\n559\n00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:54,280\nbefore the policies can get up and\nrunning.\n\n560\n00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,670\nYou got this first guy up here.\n\n561\n00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,360\nThe store BitLocker recovery information\nin Active Directory Domain Services.\n\n562\n00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,140\n>> That's a key one.\n\n563\n00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,480\n>> Yep.\nAnd with this policy enabled,\n\n564\n00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,640\nwe can require the BitLocker backup to\nthe active directory domain services.\n\n565\n00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,510\nAnd then we have two little items here,\n\n566\n00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,038\nthe select BitLocker recovery\ninformation to restore.\n\n567\n00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:25,120\nNow, we can, all right, so\nwe can store the recovery passwords and\n\n568\n00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,075\nthe key packages or\njust the recovery packages only.\n\n569\n00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:30,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n570\n00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,000\n>> Now, the key packages, right.\n\n571\n00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,370\nNow those guys,\nif we need to repair anything.\n\n572\n00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,590\nRight, there is a switch repair-bde.\n\n573\n00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,570\nAnd, to be able to utilize that,\n\n574\n00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,570\nwe have to have those key packages\nstored into active directory.\n\n575\n00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,190\n>> Yep.\n\n576\n00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,690\n>> Yep.\n\n577\n00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,740\nAll right, and there's that guy.\n\n578\n00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,160\nWe just click on cancel.\n\n579\n00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,400\n>> And now notice that he already\nhas this one enabled, okay?\n\n580\n00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,140\nSo this means that when\nNate naturally did log on\n\n581\n00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,180\nto his machine that was joined the domain.\n\n582\n00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,090\nThis policy pushed out and\n\n583\n00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,140\nautomatically it's going to actually end\nup storing his particular recovery key,\n\n584\n00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,470\nor his recovery information right\nthere inside of the active directory.\n\n585\n00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,250\nNow you might be wondering\nwhy would he do that, well.\n\n586\n00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,640\nHe probably wouldn't, right?\n\n587\n00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,860\nThis would actually be that network that\nsays hey look, we don't want the user to\n\n588\n00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,050\nhave to worry about the very fact that\nthey have to worry about the recovery key.\n\n589\n00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,580\nSo we, I don't want to say not trust, but\n\n590\n00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,770\nif we don't want them to actually have\nto mess with it, and we want to actually\n\n591\n00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,120\ncentrally located, active directory\nis going to be encrypted anyways, so\n\n592\n00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,200\nfor us here storing it, here's actually\na central repository for us and\n\n593\n00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,485\nmakes it a lot easier for the computers\non our network as well as the users.\n\n594\n00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:47,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n595\n00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,640\nAll right.\n\n596\n00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,110\nIn this policy here the provide the unique\nidentifiers for your organization.\n\n597\n00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,285\nNow, the BitLocker drives, all right,\nhas to have this, this identifier.\n\n598\n00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:59,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This identifier in there.\n\n599\n00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,840\nAnd it has to have it.\n\n600\n00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,510\nIt's a very tough one.\n\n601\n00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,180\nThe BitLocker identification field.\n\n602\n00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,270\nSo I set this one to, to Chickabow, which\nis the name of the little domain here.\n\n603\n00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,140\nIt can really be any\nstring that you wanted.\n\n604\n00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,705\nThe second spot in there allow\na BitLocker identification field.\n\n605\n00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:15,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n606\n00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:19,010\n>> Now there is a,\nanother policy that says to deny\n\n607\n00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,330\nwrite access to removable drives\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n608\n00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,645\n>> If they are not BitLocker encrypted.\n\n609\n00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:25,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n610\n00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,475\n>> If they are BitLocker encrypted, and\nthey have that identification field,\n\n611\n00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,240\n>> Chickabow right in that second one.\n\n612\n00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,000\nThen it will allow right access\nto that removable drive.\n\n613\n00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,050\nSo there's two parts there.\n\n614\n00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,270\nNow click on cancel there.\n\n615\n00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,350\nAnd, you know and there's yeah,\nsome other in here and\n\n616\n00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,790\nyou can set the decipher\nstrength if we wanted to.\n\n617\n00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,258\nBy default, it is AES-128.\n\n618\n00:28:49,258 --> 00:28:51,730\nYou can change it to 256.\n\n619\n00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,390\nNow, so yeah, and everything you know,\n\n620\n00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,726\nI've been talking about is to\nprotect this recovery key.\n\n621\n00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:00,235\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n622\n00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:01,485\n>> Now, Ronnie\n>> Yep.\n\n623\n00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:06,165\n>> So, and if something is encrypted with\nAS128, if I don't have a key and it's\n\n624\n00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:10,525\nencrypted, how difficult would it be to\njust crack it open and get the stuff out.\n\n625\n00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:12,505\n>> Not a yes\n>> Yeah.\n\n626\n00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:13,085\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n627\n00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:13,790\nHundreds of years.\n\n628\n00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,145\n>> [LAUGH] Hundreds of years?\n\n629\n00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:16,200\n>> Hundreds of years.\n\n630\n00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,140\n>> Right.\nWhat if you've got like,\n\n631\n00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,140\na whole bunch of computers clustered?\n\n632\n00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,035\n>> Yeah, hundreds of years.\n\n633\n00:29:21,035 --> 00:29:23,980\n>> [LAUGH]\nYeah, so.\n\n634\n00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n635\n00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,160\n>> Keeping tabs on this recovery key.\n\n636\n00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,130\n>> Yeah, I mean\n>> Yeah.\n\n637\n00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,770\n>> If,if if you are unable to,\n\n638\n00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,630\nI guess, properly unlock\na BitLocker encrypted drive.\n\n639\n00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,690\nAnd, you know, anything like trucrypt or\nsome of those others are the same way.\n\n640\n00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean, it's gone, it's lost.\n\n641\n00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,510\n>> Mhm.\n>> All right, so, theres that.\n\n642\n00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:45,480\nAll right, so, now the next set of little\n\n643\n00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,515\npolicies here are in\nthe operating system drives.\n\n644\n00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:49,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n645\n00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,620\n>> And this one, all right,\n\n646\n00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,914\nnow this policy here requires\nadditional authentication at start up.\n\n647\n00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:58,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now let's say that\n\n648\n00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,970\nwe don't have a TPM and a computer.\n\n649\n00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> You can still BitLocker.\n\n650\n00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,060\n>> Right.\n>> You can still use BitLocker\n\n651\n00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,110\n>> But you know, you just\n\n652\n00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,200\nhave either that password a pin or a USB\n>> Key.\n\n653\n00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,470\n>> Key.\n\n654\n00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,020\nTo use those,\nyou have to have this policy enabled.\n\n655\n00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,060\nNow, just in case everything,\neverything went to,\n\n656\n00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,220\nwent to heck, I spun up a virtual\nmachine and BitLocker that one as well.\n\n657\n00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,620\nSo we could use that as a failsafe.\n\n658\n00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620\nAnd for that one I did have to\n\n659\n00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,730\nenable this policy\n>> And so\n\n660\n00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,520\nit says allow BitLocker without\na compatible TPM, yes, we've got that one.\n\n661\n00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,040\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n662\n00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,940\nthen we have the various\nsettings down there.\n\n663\n00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,490\nSo configure the TPM.\n\n664\n00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,495\nSo we will allow a TPM.\n\n665\n00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:39,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then these different\n\n666\n00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,650\n>> Possibilities.\n\n667\n00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,100\nNow we can use all of them, which I have\ndone here or you can use one of them.\n\n668\n00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,910\nIf you did not want to use it with\nthe pen, you say, you know, yeah.\n\n669\n00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,430\nDon't, do not allow it with the pen.\n\n670\n00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,130\nYou know?\n\n671\n00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,940\nDo not allow with a start up key, or\njust allow everything, which I did for\n\n672\n00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,538\nsimplicity and another option in here.\n\n673\n00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:07,005\nChoose how BitLocker protected\noperating system drives are recovered.\n\n674\n00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:09,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now this one here, that we do need,\n\n675\n00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,040\nall right?\n\n676\n00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,860\nThis one is enabled, all right?\n\n677\n00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,550\nConfigure user storage of the BitLocker\nrecovery key information, all right?\n\n678\n00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:19,090\nSo we're going to allow did\nyou recover your password?\n\n679\n00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,860\nSure, you know.\n\n680\n00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,530\n>> Yep.\n>> And,\n\n681\n00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,260\nright down there in that check box.\n\n682\n00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,240\nSecond one down.\n\n683\n00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,056\nSave BitLocker recovery information\nto Active Directory for\n\n684\n00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,040\nthe\n>> There it is.\n\n685\n00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,000\n>> So,\nwe have to have that one in there too.\n\n686\n00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,365\nSave it.\nAnd then for\n\n687\n00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:40,330\nthe operating system drives store the\nrecovery password and that key package.\n\n688\n00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:45,790\nSo, if the drive becomes corrupted or\nsomething, we can use that repair-PDE.\n\n689\n00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,390\nWith that key package and\nhopefully save our drive.\n\n690\n00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,070\n>> Yup.\n\n691\n00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,760\n>> Now this one is incredibly\nimportant to us, right?\n\n692\n00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,770\nIf it is a requirement by your security\npolicy that those BitLocker keys are not\n\n693\n00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,250\ngoing to be stored and files\nare actually going to be kept securely.\n\n694\n00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,365\nBut they need to be stored encrypted, and\n\n695\n00:32:05,365 --> 00:32:09,550\nprefer to be stored up in\nActive Directory here, okay?\n\n696\n00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,728\nYou want to make sure that you do have\nthis one actually checked here so\n\n697\n00:32:13,728 --> 00:32:17,860\nthat you can actually recover\nthe drives here by using it.\n\n698\n00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,150\nIf it's not enabled, you can't do it.\n\n699\n00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,205\nSo remember that by far.\n\n700\n00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:25,757\nIt's a good scenario for\nus to really keep in mind.\n\n701\n00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:27,995\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Mm-hm\n\n702\n00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:30,040\n>> Alright so, click cancel on that one.\n\n703\n00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,843\n[COUGH] Alright.\n\n704\n00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:35,040\nAnd then so we will be messing\naround with that BitLocker To Go.\n\n705\n00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,175\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so then,\n\n706\n00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:39,075\nlet's click down here on\nthe removable data drives.\n\n707\n00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:43,425\nAnd da ta da,\nI didn't enable anything in here.\n\n708\n00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,932\nLet's go ahead and turn some stuff on.\n\n709\n00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:49,637\nHere is that one policy,\ndenied write access to removable drives,\n\n710\n00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,334\nnot protected by a BitLocker.\n\n711\n00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:56,096\nAll right, so if we enable this one,\nthen it will look for\n\n712\n00:32:56,096 --> 00:33:00,772\na drive that has that identifier\nin there to write to it.\n\n713\n00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,820\nWe will control that one.\n\n714\n00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,070\n>> That one underneath,\nthe fourth drive, Yeah.\n\n715\n00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,052\nYeah.\n>> All right, we can turn this one on.\n\n716\n00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:17,970\nAll right, I see a force drive\nencryption type on removal drive so\n\n717\n00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,427\nwe can, we can force that on there.\n\n718\n00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:23,900\n[INAUDIBLE] Full encryption, use space.\n\n719\n00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,330\nWe can, just allow the user,\nwhich one Ron you think?\n\n720\n00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,340\n>> Let's just do the full\nencryption at this point here.\n\n721\n00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,840\n>> All right.\n\n722\n00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,920\n>> Now you might be wondering,\nwhy you would want to force this.\n\n723\n00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,220\nSo, why in the world would I\nwant to enforce the idea of\n\n724\n00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,860\nremoval of drives having to be encrypted?\n\n725\n00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:46,320\n>> Well, let's say it would, I guess, for\na rule of drive writing lots of files\n\n726\n00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,000\nto it on there, if you delete it, files\naren't always necessarily always deleted,\n\n727\n00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,230\nand so for a drive that has been used\na lot of times, it is possible for\n\n728\n00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:02,800\nsomebody to perform some kind of recovery,\nat the end of recovery of those drives,\n\n729\n00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,380\nand pull out some of that old data\noff there, with some success.\n\n730\n00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n731\n00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:11,520\n>> And, if we only encrypt the used space,\nwell then there's all that\n\n732\n00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,500\nextra space out there that, yeah,\nI mean it could be recovered.\n\n733\n00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,360\nIf we just full encrypt that sucker.\n\n734\n00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Then there's no\n\n735\n00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,315\nway anybody could try to\nrecover any data whatsoever.\n\n736\n00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:21,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n737\n00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,690\nNow, you may think, Duncan, in the place\nwhere I work nobody would do this, but\n\n738\n00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,070\nI hate to say it USB drives\ncan disappear very quickly.\n\n739\n00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:32,330\nIt could be plugged into your computer\none minute, you might actually see, and\n\n740\n00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,660\nI've seen this happen even here, where\ndrives have actually been left in the same\n\n741\n00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,420\ncomputer for day after day after day.\n\n742\n00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,690\nAnd nobody pays attention to it until\nthey go reach for it and it's now gone.\n\n743\n00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,760\nAnd when that drive now is gone,\nwell what can you say?\n\n744\n00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,400\nYou might actually now remember, hey, I\nstored some important information on there\n\n745\n00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,430\nand by actually ensuring that we enforce\nthe encryption on that particular drive\n\n746\n00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:01,230\nhere or choosing that, that now that drive\ndoes go out at least it's been encrypted.\n\n747\n00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,450\nThey'd have to at least\nget a password recovery or\n\n748\n00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,550\nsome type of recovery\nto be able to do that.\n\n749\n00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,340\nSo in forcing that drive encryption\non those removable drive, good idea.\n\n750\n00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,182\nOkay, this is what we have.\n\n751\n00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:12,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n[COUGH] All right.\n\n752\n00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:18,200\nAll right and so another policy is so\nthat we can turn on here, on this guy.\n\n753\n00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,855\nChoose how BitLocker protected\nremovable drives can be recovered.\n\n754\n00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:22,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right,\n\n755\n00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,880\nwe'll go ahead and, and able this policy.\n\n756\n00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,830\nWe will allow a data\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n757\n00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,740\n>> A data recovery agent to get that.\n\n758\n00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,540\nWe'll allow those other guys, most of the\nstuff we will just accept the defaults for\n\n759\n00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,390\nthis example and save the BitLocker\nrecovery information to active directory,\n\n760\n00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,540\nsure.\n\n761\n00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,920\nAnd we'll back up all of that stuff.\n\n762\n00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,120\n>> Yeah, and\nit's that last check box that I wanted to,\n\n763\n00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,040\neven though we don't actually\nhave it turned on there,\n\n764\n00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,820\nnotice it says do not enable BitLocker\nrecovery until the recovery information\n\n765\n00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,280\nis stored on the active directory\nbefore the removed album drops, right?\n\n766\n00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,260\nThis is a protection unto itself, okay?\n\n767\n00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,440\nIt says, look, we're not gonna actually\nencrypt something until we have what\n\n768\n00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,170\nthe recovery key for it.\n\n769\n00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,380\nSo it's a good idea.\n\n770\n00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,730\nIf you encrypt it and you don't\nactually know if the actual drive\n\n771\n00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,687\nhas a recovery key that might be,\nagain, a problem.\n\n772\n00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:17,140\nSo, another option that is\na very valuable option for\n\n773\n00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,080\nus here to try to remember, and\nreally is a protection for us as well.\n\n774\n00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,355\n>> Yeah, you know, let's say that\nwe don't enforce this, right?\n\n775\n00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:30,200\nThat we can allow the BitLocker drives\njust to be encrypted all over the place\n\n776\n00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,550\nwithout requiring that recovery key to\nbe backed up into active directory, and\n\n777\n00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,220\nit could be that a disgruntled user,\n\n778\n00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,960\nperhaps he has some information saved on\nhis hard drive or perhaps, some other hard\n\n779\n00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,420\ndrive somewhere else, who just locked the\nthing up, delete its key and walk away.\n\n780\n00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,710\nAnd essentially everything would be locked\ndown and lost, unless that disgruntled\n\n781\n00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:57,100\nuser, he keeps some kind of recovery\nkey for handsome, or who knows what.\n\n782\n00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,785\nIt can be horrible to the company.\n\n783\n00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:02,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n784\n00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,230\n>> So we can lock it down so\npeople can't do this.\n\n785\n00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,695\nSame thing with EFS.\n\n786\n00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:10,890\n>> Mm-hm. Yeah. When you and I talked\nabout EFS, we can lock that down so\n\n787\n00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,515\nthat users can't do anything like that.\n\n788\n00:37:13,515 --> 00:37:15,058\n>> Yeah.\nNow the key here for us,\n\n789\n00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:18,521\nespecially as we're preparing for the\nexam, is to make sure that you know how\n\n790\n00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:21,956\nto get to these policies and understand\nthe differences between the three.\n\n791\n00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:24,931\nWhen there's operating system drives,\nthere's fixed drives and\n\n792\n00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:28,374\nthen there's removable drives for us,\nand each of those do have things that we\n\n793\n00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:31,060\nactually wanna make sure\nthat we can go through.\n\n794\n00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,810\nAnd be able to chose what we need to,\n\n795\n00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,010\ngiven this scenario that is out there,\nokay?\n\n796\n00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,397\nNow, you might be thinking, well,\nRonnie, I'm studying for 688.\n\n797\n00:37:40,397 --> 00:37:47,160\nNate just showed us the whole thing in\nWindows 2012, active directory here,\n\n798\n00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,740\nhow in the world am I going to be able\nto take a look at all those policies.\n\n799\n00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,280\nWell, let me show you, okay?\n\n800\n00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,510\nI'm on a Windows 8.1 machine myself and\nso,\n\n801\n00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:03,200\ninside of Windows 8.1 notice that\nmine says local group policy editor.\n\n802\n00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,620\nIn the local group policy editor\non your very own machine,\n\n803\n00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,353\nthe same setting, I went exactly where\nNate did in the active directory policy,\n\n804\n00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:17,950\ncomputer configuration, administrative\ntemplates and under administrative\n\n805\n00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,740\ntemplates the Windows component and\nthen BitLocker drive encryption.\n\n806\n00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,420\nI was trying to make sure I follow along\nso that we weren't losing anything and so\n\n807\n00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,310\nthat I actually saw the same things here.\n\n808\n00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,120\nI saw pretty much the exact same things.\n\n809\n00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,440\nIn most organizations, it's gonna be\ndone by the network administrator or\n\n810\n00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,620\nthe desktop enterprise administrator\nthat's actually there, or whoever it is.\n\n811\n00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,330\nThey're gonna control that, but on your\nown, as you're studying for this, and\n\n812\n00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:47,330\nyou're actually realizing what needs\nto be done, if you're in a domain,\n\n813\n00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,940\nit's gonna be pushed down\nthrough group policy.\n\n814\n00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,230\nOn the individual computer though,\n\n815\n00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,670\nyes, you have the chance\nto explore these options.\n\n816\n00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,510\nSo take a look at them and\n\n817\n00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,680\nrealize that there are different\nscenarios that we actually have here.\n\n818\n00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,020\nAnd just take a look at some of\nthe option that we talked about.\n\n819\n00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,010\nOkay, very important.\n\n820\n00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,517\n>> All right, so Rodney, so on your\nmachine there is one option that we didn't\n\n821\n00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:10,290\nget to on this machine but\nwe can look at it on yours.\n\n822\n00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:15,159\nAll right, so just above Windows\ncomponents, in the tree over there,\n\n823\n00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:20,109\nif you just collapse Windows components\nand let's expand out system and\n\n824\n00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:24,265\ndown in the T's,\nlet's go to the trusted platform module.\n\n825\n00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:25,427\n>> Yep.\nThere we are.\n\n826\n00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:28,961\n>> All right, and da, da,\nda, so that very top one,\n\n827\n00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:33,500\nturn on TPM back up to active\ndirectory domain services.\n\n828\n00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,520\nSo on the policy on a little domain\ncontroller for our lab setting.\n\n829\n00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,425\n>> All right.\n>> This policy is enabled, and\n\n830\n00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:45,620\n[COUGH] what it does is this one\nsaves that TPM owner information and\n\n831\n00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,250\nthe, the stuff into active directory\nif we want to back that stuff up,\n\n832\n00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:53,153\nyou can use this policy to\nsave those items there.\n\n833\n00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:54,010\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n834\n00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,190\nSo, there's another location as well.\n\n835\n00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,840\nOkay, but the BitLocker location,\nmake sure you explore that as well, okay.\n\n836\n00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,936\nA lot of the options that you may\nunderstand why it's working this way is\n\n837\n00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:09,443\nbecause those things are actually set up\ninside of that active directory group\n\n838\n00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:12,583\npolicy for us And\nif you do have that policy pushed out,\n\n839\n00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:15,840\nthat may be controlling\nthe way it's working.\n\n840\n00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,370\nSo if you do find out that you're\nnot storing the Active Directory, or\n\n841\n00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,210\nyou're not storing the recovery\nkey in Active Directory,\n\n842\n00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,420\nI would check the policy settings,\nas well.\n\n843\n00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,230\nAnd then make the referral on that and\nactually understand that too.\n\n844\n00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,617\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n845\n00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:31,450\nAll right, Rodney.\n\n846\n00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,880\nSo now that we have our\npolicy settings set.\n\n847\n00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,960\nOur machine is joined to the domain.\n\n848\n00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,568\n>> Right.\n\n849\n00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:43,210\n>> Now it so, to have the recovery\ninformation successfully saved,\n\n850\n00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:46,300\nfrom our client machine\ninto active directory.\n\n851\n00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:46,910\n>> Right.\n\n852\n00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,360\n>> The, the best case is to have\n\n853\n00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,510\neverything on the back\nend set up before hand.\n\n854\n00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,820\n>> Right.\n>> The posses in effect and\n\n855\n00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,570\nthen, you BitLocker, or\nencrypt the drives after that.\n\n856\n00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,640\nSo that way, you know, make sure that\nall that information is stored over.\n\n857\n00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,040\nNow there is some manage\n[INAUDIBLE] commands to where\n\n858\n00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,790\nyou can register\nan Active Directory after the fact.\n\n859\n00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,642\nSo we can go over a few of those.\n\n860\n00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:16,240\nBut yeah, best case scenario though,\nhave everything set up beforehand.\n\n861\n00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,490\nAnd then encrypt our stuff.\n\n862\n00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n863\n00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,840\n>> So, now that we do have everything\nset up, what's what's next?\n\n864\n00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,050\n>> Yeah.\n>> What do you think?\n\n865\n00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,300\n>> We want to take a look at the,\n\n866\n00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,710\nthe kind of thumb drive that we\ntalked about encrypting here.\n\n867\n00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,510\nNow, my machine went a little bit nuts and\n\n868\n00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,910\nis dropping that I-V-G-A\nconnection to display here.\n\n869\n00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,780\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna re-encrypt that drive and\n\n870\n00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:39,860\nnot worry about 33 updates here, and\ntalk about the idea of Bitlocker To Go.\n\n871\n00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,500\nBitlocker To Go is a neat thing, okay,\n\n872\n00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,110\nas long as you can actually\nrecover those drives.\n\n873\n00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,970\nThe key is that you actually\nunderstand the recovery process here.\n\n874\n00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,566\nSo, Nate has a thumb drive\nthat we're gonna do this with.\n\n875\n00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:54,740\n>> Hm, all right, yep, so\nthere's this little, thumb drive guy here,\n\n876\n00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,790\nthis little tiny baby one\nI keep on my key chain.\n\n877\n00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,805\nPretty fancy it, but\nit is slower than dirt.\n\n878\n00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:06,740\nSo, we just have a few minutes\nleft here on our break.\n\n879\n00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,250\nLet me slide this guy in.\n\n880\n00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,650\nAnd, yeah, chances are if it\ngrinds away too much then\n\n881\n00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,040\nwe'll let it finish\nencrypting during the break.\n\n882\n00:42:18,132 --> 00:42:22,230\nAll right, so this guy popped up here,\ntraveller, that is the removal drive.\n\n883\n00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:27,900\nWe will right click on this guy and\nwe'll turn on Bitlocker for\n\n884\n00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:34,771\nit, and it will analyze this guy and\nwe'll continue on with the wizard no,\n\n885\n00:42:34,771 --> 00:42:39,373\nthe so we will use a password\nto unlock this drive.\n\n886\n00:42:47,756 --> 00:42:50,490\nAll right, and we'll click on next and\nif we had a smart card,\n\n887\n00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,155\nwe can use that to unlock this drive.\n\n888\n00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:54,300\nWhich I don't have any smart curves.\n\n889\n00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,430\n>> Me, neither.\n\n890\n00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,100\n>> You don't have any?\n>> Nope.\n\n891\n00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,930\n>> All right.\n\n892\n00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,870\nAnd then for our recovery key, sure,\nwe'll just save this queue to a file and\n\n893\n00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:06,960\nlet's choose the same place we saved\nthat other one on that other drive.\n\n894\n00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,140\nAnd the games folder, because then\nI'll never lose this games folder.\n\n895\n00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,230\n>> Never.\n>> That's for, that's for positive.\n\n896\n00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,420\nAll right.\n\n897\n00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,310\nNow, I'll save.\n\n898\n00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,330\nClick on Next.\n\n899\n00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,705\nAnd, okay.\n\n900\n00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:22,030\nSo, we did turn on that policy to,\nenforce whole disk.\n\n901\n00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,100\nLet's see.\nLet's see what it does.\n\n902\n00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,480\nLet's just choose.\n\n903\n00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:24,990\nUsed disc.\n\n904\n00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,700\nDut, duh, are you ready to encrypt?\n\n905\n00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,090\nSure, start encrypting.\n\n906\n00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,190\nIt didn't say anything.\n\n907\n00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,970\n>> Hm.\n\n908\n00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,150\n>> I didn't refresh policy.\n\n909\n00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,670\n>> Cuz they added that on there.\n\n910\n00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,940\n>> Oh.\nThat's fine.\n\n911\n00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,690\n>> Oh, you know what?\nI didn't refresh policy after\n\n912\n00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,865\nI even enabled the recovery\nkey to be backed up.\n\n913\n00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:40,670\n>> Uh-oh.\n\n914\n00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,250\n>> Well.\n\n915\n00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:41,860\n>> Here we go.\n\n916\n00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,870\n>> We'll we'll check it out.\n\n917\n00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,344\nWe'll run those, those manage commands.\n\n918\n00:43:44,344 --> 00:43:45,530\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n919\n00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,150\n>> And it makes sure everything\ngets gets backed up.\n\n920\n00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> But you know,\n\n921\n00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,750\nwe have just a couple\nminutes left on break.\n\n922\n00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,940\nBut before we go there,\nlets take a look at those recovery feeds.\n\n923\n00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,790\n>> Okay.\nSure.\n\n924\n00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,670\n>> And see what they look like.\n\n925\n00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,270\nSo I'll just drag this guy\noff to the side there.\n\n926\n00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,879\nLets go take a look at those keys.\n\n927\n00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,650\nAnd in the games folder.\n\n928\n00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,500\nI don't remember which one was, which-\n>> The second one is the-\n\n929\n00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,100\n>> I'll probably do the time stamps.\n\n930\n00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,050\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so\n\n931\n00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:15,480\nthis first key here will be for\nthe system drive.\n\n932\n00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,870\nAnd sure enough, so there is the disk\nidentifier and that recovery key.\n\n933\n00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:26,525\nNow, that identifier, so this recovery key\nwill be all, I mean, it'll be locked out.\n\n934\n00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:27,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n935\n00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,420\n>> If we're to like, like recover the key,\nlet's say, out of the Microsoft account.\n\n936\n00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,415\n>> I've had it before where bit locker,\nit detects something.\n\n937\n00:44:35,415 --> 00:44:37,290\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And locks this thing down.\n\n938\n00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,490\nSo when I log into my Microsoft account\nto go to recover that key it'll ask for\n\n939\n00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,235\nthe identifier.\n\n940\n00:44:42,235 --> 00:44:45,140\n>> Mm-hm\n>> After I provide the identifier\n\n941\n00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,100\nit will then return the key to me as well.\n\n942\n00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,930\nAnd also searching for\nan Active Directory.\n\n943\n00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,080\nYou can search for\nit a couple of different ways.\n\n944\n00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,765\nOne of the ways is searching for\nthis identifier.\n\n945\n00:44:56,765 --> 00:44:59,460\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then it will then return that key.\n\n946\n00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n947\n00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,850\nAll right.\nSo we got 2.3% on there.\n\n948\n00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:06,398\nThis is the slowest thumb drive-\n\n949\n00:45:06,398 --> 00:45:07,785\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ever.\n\n950\n00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:09,670\nBut maybe on the break, I'll go and\n\n951\n00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,060\nsnag a USB 3 1, and hurry,\nencrypt that one real quick.\n\n952\n00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,020\nAll right, Ronnie.\n>> Yeah.\n\n953\n00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,070\n>> Well, that yeah-\n>> Yeah.\n\n954\n00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,800\n>> That's that for right now.\n\n955\n00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,090\n>> Yeah.\nWhat we'll do, when we get back, right?\n\n956\n00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,930\nIs we'll take that thumb drive and\nwe'll put it into my computer, and\n\n957\n00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,765\nhopefully Nate can remember\nwhere he left his key.\n\n958\n00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,192\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we'll see if we can actually,\n\n959\n00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:32,280\ndecrypt it as we need to here.\n\n960\n00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,200\nAs well and that way we show\nthe process of recovering that,\n\n961\n00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,062\nmanually the way that we would.\n\n962\n00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:40,930\nAnd then, we can also show\nthe process of trying to use that, or\n\n963\n00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,440\nat least checking out that\ndata recovery agent as well.\n\n964\n00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n965\n00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,717\n>> Sweet.\nAll right so more BitLocker stuff,\n\n966\n00:45:46,717 --> 00:45:47,853\nafter the break.\n\n967\n00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:55,493\n[MUSIC]\n\n968\n00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:57,690\nAl lright, welcome back.\n\n969\n00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,710\nAll right.\nSo that, so the thumb drive,\n\n970\n00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,607\nright, is encrypted.\n\n971\n00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:07,145\n[LAUGH] And it, finally saved its,\ndata back into the active directory.\n\n972\n00:46:07,145 --> 00:46:10,890\nAnd so we do have that thumb drive that\nis in your computer, right now Ryan?\n\n973\n00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,620\n>> Mm-hm.\nRight.\n\n974\n00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,240\n>> All right.\n\n975\n00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,250\nAnd yeah, should we, I guess take a look.\n\n976\n00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:14,990\n>> Yeah.\n\n977\n00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:15,930\nMm-hm, yeah.\n\n978\n00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,780\nLet's just go ahead and take a look\nat how we manually would actually\n\n979\n00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,275\nneed to recover this so we have it right.\n\n980\n00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:23,880\nWe already saw the recovery key that\nNate showed us in that notepad,\n\n981\n00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,310\nthat tech file that we actually have.\n\n982\n00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,220\nAnd so now inserted into that drive, and\n\n983\n00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,095\nit takes a little bit of maneuvering\nto get it to show up here.\n\n984\n00:46:31,095 --> 00:46:32,680\n[LAUGH] But it did actually show up and\n\n985\n00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,710\nyou see where it's\nactually locked up here.\n\n986\n00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:39,050\nNow, again if I had walked\noff with 8 cepton drive and\n\n987\n00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,830\nstick it into my computer,\nthis is actually what would happen.\n\n988\n00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:46,710\nAt this point, I can double click on it\nand it will ask me to actually recover it.\n\n989\n00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,410\nIf I don't have the key.\n\n990\n00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,990\nI try to unlock it, note that it's\nasking me for the wrong password here.\n\n991\n00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:01,390\nNow I do have this option\nhere that says more options.\n\n992\n00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:07,410\nBut, there is also the recovery key that\nI can actually enter in there, as well.\n\n993\n00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,975\nAnd so when I do that, here is the actual\nrecovery key and this is where\n\n994\n00:47:10,975 --> 00:47:15,380\nI would enter in that 48 digit key\nto actually be able to run this in.\n\n995\n00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:15,915\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n996\n00:47:15,915 --> 00:47:16,435\n>> Okay.\n\n997\n00:47:16,435 --> 00:47:20,127\n>> Yep now on this one so\nbecause this computer is joined to\n\n998\n00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:21,085\na domain\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n999\n00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:25,165\n>> We did not save this recovery\nkey to other than that file.\n\n1000\n00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:26,275\n>> Right.\n>> Anywhere else.\n\n1001\n00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:31,255\nNow it was because we had those policies,\nit was automatically saved into\n\n1002\n00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:36,340\nActive Directory, where we can\ngrab that key and unlock this guy.\n\n1003\n00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:36,910\n>> Yep.\n>> Now,\n\n1004\n00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,760\nthere's two different ways that\nwe can get these recovery keys.\n\n1005\n00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,270\n>> All right.\n>> The first way is\n\n1006\n00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,210\nby trying to access that and\ngetting that recovery key that way, or\n\n1007\n00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:50,465\nwe can use a powershell command,\nto grab that key.\n\n1008\n00:47:50,465 --> 00:47:51,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To look this key up\n\n1009\n00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,210\nin Active Directory.\n\n1010\n00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:53,940\n>> Yep.\n\n1011\n00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,790\nSo that little eight digit key that we had\nis actually the one that we actually need\n\n1012\n00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,430\nhere to really help us\nout when we do this.\n\n1013\n00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,463\nSo that's the one we're and remember.\n\n1014\n00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,185\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n1015\n00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:06,855\nYep.\nWell let's take a look at the manage\n\n1016\n00:48:06,855 --> 00:48:08,045\nBD command.\n\n1017\n00:48:08,045 --> 00:48:08,545\n>> Sure.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1018\n00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:09,045\n>> Yep.\n\n1019\n00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:13,635\nAll right, so here on on my machine here.\n\n1020\n00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:17,135\nLet's expand this guy down.\n\n1021\n00:48:17,135 --> 00:48:20,677\nSo we will get into power show, and\n\n1022\n00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:24,990\na few commands that we'll go over.\n\n1023\n00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:30,660\n>> So we'll do manage dash BDE stats.\n\n1024\n00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:35,090\n>> This is the first one you should\nactually look for to verify whether or\n\n1025\n00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,470\nnot your drive is actually recovered or\n\n1026\n00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,409\nnot recovered, actually protected\nwith bit locker at this point.\n\n1027\n00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,310\nI'm going to shove that\nthumb drive back in there.\n\n1028\n00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:45,810\n>> Yep.\n\n1029\n00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,380\n>> unlocked.\n\n1030\n00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,880\n>> It says unlock it.\n\n1031\n00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,411\n>> It is locked, but\n\n1032\n00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:00,400\nOkay that got in there, all right.\n\n1033\n00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,650\nAll right sweet, so here we go.\n\n1034\n00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,920\nNow let's run that command again, so\n\n1035\n00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,650\nshowing us now the thumb drive\ndoes show up here in the status.\n\n1036\n00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,418\nAll right, so neat little things here,\nwe're going to see for\n\n1037\n00:49:15,418 --> 00:49:18,995\ntheir key protectors and\nwe do have a A data recovery agent.\n\n1038\n00:49:18,995 --> 00:49:19,850\n>> On here.\n\n1039\n00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:20,950\nSo that is that, now.\n\n1040\n00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,600\nso that identifier.\n\n1041\n00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,390\n>> Right, so let's say that,\non here, it does label that,\n\n1042\n00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:32,920\nidentifier, so this\n>> identification field and stand for\n\n1043\n00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,160\nthe volume C drive up here,\nthe identification field.\n\n1044\n00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,930\nIf you summaries in the identification\nfield did not take, or\n\n1045\n00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:42,770\nif we popped a drive in that\ndid not take policy yet\n\n1046\n00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:46,513\nto automatically set it,\nthere's a command for it.\n\n1047\n00:49:46,513 --> 00:49:51,183\n>> I manage bde and\n\n1048\n00:49:51,183 --> 00:49:55,848\nset identifier.\n\n1049\n00:49:55,848 --> 00:49:57,210\nAll right.\n\n1050\n00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,160\nAnd then whatever identifier we wanted.\n\n1051\n00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,700\nI won't run this one, I don't want\nto mess anything up on this one but\n\n1052\n00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,710\nwe would then do that there and\n\n1053\n00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:13,210\nof course actually specify which drive\nyou want to set that identifier to.\n\n1054\n00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,850\nSo we won't run this one to pose anything.\n\n1055\n00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:20,030\nRight?\nNow, let's say those recovery keys.\n\n1056\n00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:24,500\n>> All right, so the recovery information\nthat we need for these drives so\n\n1057\n00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:30,190\nwe have a managed BDE\n>> Protectors.\n\n1058\n00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,280\nAll right.\n\n1059\n00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,320\n>> And then a couple of commands here, so\nwe can say a get, and then whichever ones.\n\n1060\n00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,390\nWe'll say C drive, all right.\n\n1061\n00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:48,940\nSo we have on here, all right, we have a,\nthe TPM and it's stuff that it needs.\n\n1062\n00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,550\nWe have the numerical password is what\nwe'll use to recover that information.\n\n1063\n00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,340\nAnd we have the recovery\nagent certificate there, and\n\n1064\n00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,860\nwe could run the same thing for\nthe removal drive, so E.\n\n1065\n00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,940\nAll right, now this one so\nthere is no TPM.\n\n1066\n00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,690\nAll right, so for that manage dash BDE\ncommand, now we have the traveller drive,\n\n1067\n00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,570\nour removable thumb drive,\nwe can pull that up and\n\n1068\n00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:19,650\nsee the other commands, for\ndo pull up the, see the key information.\n\n1069\n00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:22,540\n>> Right.\n>> The hard drive, and on here,\n\n1070\n00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,400\nso we can run the suspend.\n\n1071\n00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:31,860\nManage dash BDE Hyphen protectors and\nthen the Get-command.\n\n1072\n00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:36,780\nSo we will get those protectors that\nkey information, for the C: drive.\n\n1073\n00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:42,230\n>> And we run that, and we can see there\nat the top it has the TPN information.\n\n1074\n00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,220\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n1075\n00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,750\nthis laptop does have a TPN inside of it.\n\n1076\n00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,580\nAnd then we add that numerical\npassword which is what we will use\n\n1077\n00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,640\nto recover the key.\n\n1078\n00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,185\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n1079\n00:51:52,185 --> 00:51:55,980\nthen, we have that data agent,\nrecovery agent.\n\n1080\n00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,650\nI said it backwards.\n\n1081\n00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,350\n>> Yeah.\n\n1082\n00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:01,570\n>> And we can also run that same one for\nthe E which is our removal drive.\n\n1083\n00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:05,440\nAnd running this one you see that\nthere is no TPM now onto it.\n\n1084\n00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,030\n>> Right.\n>> Of\n\n1085\n00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,040\ncourse there's no TPM on\na little thumb drive.\n\n1086\n00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,820\nWe have that information there.\n\n1087\n00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,900\n>> So let's say that we could\nbrowse over to active directory and\n\n1088\n00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,950\nthose queues aren't in there.\n\n1089\n00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,580\nSo it's not registered.\n\n1090\n00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:24,718\nWell, there is a command for\nthat one, manage-tde\n\n1091\n00:52:24,718 --> 00:52:32,970\nProtectors, AD backup.\n\n1092\n00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:38,576\nSee it won't let us do the thumb drive,\nso let's say E: and\n\n1093\n00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:43,730\nthen ID, and\nthen we need the numerical password\n\n1094\n00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,450\nLet me drop this down, and\nI don't want to type this out.\n\n1095\n00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,370\nSo I'll just select it.\n\n1096\n00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,650\nAnd since it is already in there,\nit may give us an error here, but\n\n1097\n00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,140\nwe'll just go in and\njust type it in through there.\n\n1098\n00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,340\nAll right, it's going to take it,\nbut it's that good, the i.d.\n\n1099\n00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,280\ngood, it, line up there.\n\n1100\n00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,740\nAnd I would say so.\n\n1101\n00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,630\nI would say that we wanted\nto also change the password.\n\n1102\n00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,690\nSo this drive is unlocked, right?\n\n1103\n00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,920\nSo I entered in this thumb drive,\nit's unlocked.\n\n1104\n00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,110\nAnd I don't know the password.\n\n1105\n00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,870\n>> All right.\n\n1106\n00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,710\n>> So there is a command for that one.\n\n1107\n00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:26,676\nSo manage-bde, change.\n\n1108\n00:53:26,676 --> 00:53:31,950\npassword and e:, all right.\n\n1109\n00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,560\nType in the new password.\n\n1110\n00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,060\n>> Yep.\n\n1111\n00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:39,010\n>> And confirm it.\n\n1112\n00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:40,560\nNow it doesn't display anything.\n\n1113\n00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,060\n>> Right.\n>> Although I am typing it in.\n\n1114\n00:53:48,712 --> 00:53:49,950\nAll right, there we go.\n\n1115\n00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,160\nSo that password is up there.\n\n1116\n00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,360\nAll right, and right so there we go.\n\n1117\n00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,060\nNow, let's say that we do need to go and\nrecover this information.\n\n1118\n00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:03,571\nNow, the recovery information is stored in\nactive [INAUDIBLE] with our data recovery\n\n1119\n00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:04,660\nagent and the sort.\n\n1120\n00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,363\nSo we'll, I guess well the agent could\ncome and put his, his key in it.\n\n1121\n00:54:08,363 --> 00:54:10,021\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Huh.\n\n1122\n00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:14,080\n>> And unlock it, but for that information\nlet's jump back into our domain\n\n1123\n00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:19,060\ncontroller, and we'll go into\ngood old users and computers.\n\n1124\n00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,460\nAll right, and\nthen in our computers container.\n\n1125\n00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,260\nAll right.\n\n1126\n00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:31,660\nSo this laptop here, that we've been doing\nall these demos from, is that CKBW-CL2.\n\n1127\n00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:36,340\nAre now, the, anything that was encrypted\n\n1128\n00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,150\nfrom this laptop will then be saved\nin this Computer's container.\n\n1129\n00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,230\nWe right click on it and\nchoose properties.\n\n1130\n00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:47,725\nAnd this tab up here,\nBitLocker [COUGH] recovery.\n\n1131\n00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:48,690\nAll right.\n\n1132\n00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:53,955\nAnd so now we have two, two password id's\nin there, one for the laptop itself, and\n\n1133\n00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:58,775\nthe second one for the thumb drive\nthat we encrypted using this laptop.\n\n1134\n00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:02,295\nAnd we can see the time stamps on there,\nso that, the bottom one, 9:30, so\n\n1135\n00:55:02,295 --> 00:55:07,220\nthat was the one for the laptop and\nthe top one there,10:35, that would be for\n\n1136\n00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:07,810\nthe thumb drive.\n\n1137\n00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:12,690\nAnd we have the password down here, and\nwhich computer, and all that other stuff.\n\n1138\n00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:17,180\nNow, there's also, let's say,\nyou have some user.\n\n1139\n00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,075\ncalls up the help desk and,\nand says, \"Hey,\n\n1140\n00:55:19,075 --> 00:55:24,800\nI locked out of my computer, or\nI locked out of my thumb drive.\n\n1141\n00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,240\nthey said, Okay Riley, what's,\nwhat's your computer's name?\n\n1142\n00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,410\nWell, let's say, there's thousands\nof computers spread all over and\n\n1143\n00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,000\nthe help desk guy doesn't want go and\n\n1144\n00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,945\nhave to search through everything\nto find Betty and Sel's Computer.\n\n1145\n00:55:37,945 --> 00:55:40,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I pull up that re,\n\n1146\n00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,278\nthat key recovery information.\n\n1147\n00:55:41,278 --> 00:55:41,829\n>> Yeah.\n\n1148\n00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:48,810\n>> So, [COUGH] what we can do then,\nis we can right click on our domain.\n\n1149\n00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,940\nAnd choose find bitlocker\nrecovery password.\n\n1150\n00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:57,530\nAll right, so now we need, the first\neight characters of that numerical ID.\n\n1151\n00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,580\nSo let's just minimize\nthat guy right there.\n\n1152\n00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:07,380\nLet's open up, our PowerShell again.\n\n1153\n00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,670\nAll right, so we'll use that one for\nthe, the thumb drive.\n\n1154\n00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,920\nAll right, so the first three.\n\n1155\n00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,050\nRight?\n\n1156\n00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,000\nSix or first eight, yeah, sorry.\n\n1157\n00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:24,000\n16, 4, C, B, C, F, B.\n\n1158\n00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,400\nSearch.\n\n1159\n00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,260\nWhat do we get?\n\n1160\n00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:30,860\nThere it is.\n\n1161\n00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,580\nIt's a nice day.\n\n1162\n00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:32,372\nAll right, buddy,\n\n1163\n00:56:32,372 --> 00:56:35,318\nlisten carefully cuz there's going to\nbe a lot of numbers coming your way.\n\n1164\n00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:37,197\n16, 4, CVFB, oh man.\n\n1165\n00:56:37,197 --> 00:56:38,338\nI have to repeat it again, Betty?\n\n1166\n00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:39,088\nYeah.\n>> You're fired.\n\n1167\n00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:42,400\n>> So [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, it works very well, right?\n\n1168\n00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,718\nAs long as somebody's actually located\nright there and can get access to it,\n\n1169\n00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:48,325\nthe administrator or\nwhoever it is that's managing\n\n1170\n00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:52,515\nthis should be able to get access\nto those passwords and do that.\n\n1171\n00:56:52,515 --> 00:56:54,865\nNow, there is a weakness in the system.\n\n1172\n00:56:54,865 --> 00:56:57,045\nSince the administrator\nactually has to do this,\n\n1173\n00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:59,615\nhe has to be able to give\nyou that information back.\n\n1174\n00:56:59,615 --> 00:57:01,767\nAnd he does, let's say, in email.\n\n1175\n00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:04,087\nA lot of times emails are unencrypted,\nwhich means, again,\n\n1176\n00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,127\nthat it's not protected.\n\n1177\n00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:09,117\nAlso, there could be a social\nengineering attack, okay?\n\n1178\n00:57:09,117 --> 00:57:12,617\nIn this sense, let's say that I\nactually take Nate's laptop and\n\n1179\n00:57:12,617 --> 00:57:16,023\nI just call up whoever the help desk is,\nand I tell them, hey,\n\n1180\n00:57:16,023 --> 00:57:22,283\nI'm on Chicakbow.CL2, and\nthey just simply read me off the password.\n\n1181\n00:57:22,283 --> 00:57:24,213\nThey don't have a clue whether or\n\n1182\n00:57:24,213 --> 00:57:27,473\nnot I'm actually the user that's supposed\nto be actually doing that or not.\n\n1183\n00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:29,563\nSo there's a lot of things\nthat actually have to be done.\n\n1184\n00:57:29,563 --> 00:57:32,150\nSo in other words,\nyou need other verification\n\n1185\n00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,940\nthat could possibly be in place\nto actually help you out.\n\n1186\n00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,620\nOkay?\n\n1187\n00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,400\nSo, even though the data\nrecovery agent is the great\n\n1188\n00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,002\ncentral management place that\nwe can go to do this here,\n\n1189\n00:57:42,002 --> 00:57:45,050\nand it really does help in an organization\nto have it centrally managed.\n\n1190\n00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,440\nAnd that way it's backed up as well and\n\n1191\n00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,890\nreplicated to the other\ndomain controllers here.\n\n1192\n00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,390\nIt really can be,\n\n1193\n00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:56,810\nin terms of recovery here, a bit of\nan administrative effort to do so, okay?\n\n1194\n00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,260\nSo if you only have a few machines,\nprobably not so worried about it.\n\n1195\n00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,870\nEven if you have hundreds,\nnot so worried about it.\n\n1196\n00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:07,120\nBut what if you're actually managing not\nonly machines on your network here that\n\n1197\n00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,160\nare connected, but also thumb drives and\nother devices that may possibly\n\n1198\n00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,710\ncome in as well, in which the policies\nare not gonna actually apply very easily?\n\n1199\n00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,390\nOkay?\n\n1200\n00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:20,980\nSo in this sense here, we actually\nhave another tool that we can use.\n\n1201\n00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,740\nWe can manually, again,\nsave the password to a file.\n\n1202\n00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,350\nOkay?\n\n1203\n00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:27,910\nWe can use that data recovery agent.\n\n1204\n00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,610\nAnd we can actually use that\ncombination of that managed\n\n1205\n00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:35,200\nBDE to help us to get the information we\nneed to retrieve that information as well.\n\n1206\n00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:40,354\nBut there is one last tool that we need to\ntalk about here, which is our favorite.\n\n1207\n00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:41,380\n>> [SOUND]\n>> No.\n\n1208\n00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,340\nNot really.\n\n1209\n00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:42,903\nIt is not.\n\n1210\n00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:45,270\n[LAUGH] It's our MBAM here.\n\n1211\n00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:48,654\nThe Microsoft Bit Locker Administration\nand\n\n1212\n00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:51,865\nMonitoring something is what we've got.\n\n1213\n00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:57,535\nMonitor, I guess,\nis pretty much the key here for us.\n\n1214\n00:58:57,535 --> 00:59:02,890\nNow, in this idea, okay, it helps\n\n1215\n00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:08,620\nreally in the idea of recovery because\nit gives us essentially a portal that,\n\n1216\n00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,770\nif somebody actually does lose their bit\nlocker information, that they can actually\n\n1217\n00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:18,140\nconnect to, okay, and be able to\nactually recover their own information.\n\n1218\n00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,850\nOkay?\n\n1219\n00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:22,930\nNow, to say that this is\n\n1220\n00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:28,640\na simple setup would be wrong.\n\n1221\n00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,150\nI'm trying to think of a great word for\nit.\n\n1222\n00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:35,190\nBut it normally requires a lot\nof additional setup, okay?\n\n1223\n00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:40,425\nFor those of you going on towards your\nserver classes, or your server shows here,\n\n1224\n00:59:40,425 --> 00:59:44,380\nyou'll actually be able to see\nwhere you'll set some of this up.\n\n1225\n00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,808\nBut they do make what they call\na standalone configuration.\n\n1226\n00:59:48,808 --> 00:59:51,460\nNate, how successful does\nthat standalone work?\n\n1227\n00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1228\n00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:52,930\n>> Yeah.\nFunny.\n\n1229\n00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,570\nYeah.\nFunny story.\n\n1230\n00:59:54,570 --> 01:00:01,320\nI've [COUGH] been messing around with MBAM\nquite a bit before we got the show going.\n\n1231\n01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,140\nAnd yeah.\n\n1232\n01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,725\nIt's a bit challenging to\nget everything set up.\n\n1233\n01:00:05,725 --> 01:00:09,350\nAnd just about mostly documentation,\non getting it-\n\n1234\n01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:10,190\n>> Sparse?\n\n1235\n01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:10,760\n>> Yes,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1236\n01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,365\n>> Sparser with a standalone.\n\n1237\n01:00:12,365 --> 01:00:16,730\nJust about everything out there is for\nsystem center configuration.\n\n1238\n01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:19,530\nAnd it gets a bit in depth.\n\n1239\n01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:23,420\n>> Yeah, and so anything that actually is\nessentially an add-on or an enhancement to\n\n1240\n01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,580\nwhat we would call System Center\nConfiguration Manager means that it\n\n1241\n01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:31,770\nnormally requires a ton, or I won't say\na ton, a lot more infrastructure set up.\n\n1242\n01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:32,410\nOkay?\n\n1243\n01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:36,310\nSo we're not getting into that part\nof the idea of the MBAM, okay?\n\n1244\n01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,600\nAnd so\nwe don't actually have that set up for us.\n\n1245\n01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,840\nBut we do want you to actually\nknow that once it's set up,\n\n1246\n01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:45,620\nit can really manage BitLocker for\nthe network fairly easily.\n\n1247\n01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,220\nOkay?\n\n1248\n01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:50,830\nSo in terms of least administrative\neffort, once it's set up, that is probably\n\n1249\n01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:54,190\nthe way that you would actually go\nis to use something like that, okay?\n\n1250\n01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,380\nNow what I'm about to show you,\n\n1251\n01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:59,430\nthis isn't any secret Microsoft\ndocument that I have here.\n\n1252\n01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,680\nThis is actually part of TechNet\nwhere you can actually go on and\n\n1253\n01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,510\nthey have what we call\nvirtual labs that are there.\n\n1254\n01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:07,580\nAnd what they've done in the background\nis that they've set up the actual\n\n1255\n01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,090\ninfrastructure, but they tell us right\nhere that in this particular setup,\n\n1256\n01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,300\nwhat you're gonna see on the client end.\n\n1257\n01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:19,480\nSo for us here, normally one you use\nMBAM and you get it set up here.\n\n1258\n01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,232\nRight?\n\n1259\n01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:24,380\nThat's gonna require some group policies\nthat are actually set up for us, but then,\n\n1260\n01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,300\nif you're on a machine that's joined\na domain and you are requiring BitLocker,\n\n1261\n01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:31,140\nwhat you'll normally see is something\nthat looks like this, okay?\n\n1262\n01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,010\nWhere it tells you that\nthe Microsoft BitLocker Administration and\n\n1263\n01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,350\nMonitoring has been turned on here, okay?\n\n1264\n01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:39,990\nAnd it says that your company\nrequires this computer to be secure\n\n1265\n01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:41,360\nusing BitLocker.\n\n1266\n01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,970\nSo it's not something you\nactually have to turn on.\n\n1267\n01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:44,960\nIt tells you.\n\n1268\n01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,590\nYou're gonna use it, okay,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n1269\n01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:51,280\nAnd all you do is you simply go ahead and\n\n1270\n01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,270\nif it gives you the option to\nrequest an exemption, you can.\n\n1271\n01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,001\nBut if it doesn't, it's just telling\nyou you're either gonna postpone it or\n\n1272\n01:01:57,001 --> 01:01:58,229\nyou're gonna start it,\n\n1273\n01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:02,340\nbut more than likely it locks down your\ncomputer until you actually do that, okay.\n\n1274\n01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,160\nSo, you actually end up walking\nthrough some of this here.\n\n1275\n01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:10,420\nAnd, like I said, you can go to TechNet\nand actually pull this document up.\n\n1276\n01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:14,208\nIf you go to the virtual labs and\ntype in MBAM, you actually see it, okay?\n\n1277\n01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:18,330\nSo then, when it actually says\nit's gonna require a shut down.\n\n1278\n01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,220\nAnd then it walks you through and\n\n1279\n01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,420\nyou actually see the system check up\nhere in the upper left-hand corner.\n\n1280\n01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,226\nTells you essentially the steps that\nyou're gonna go through to make this\n\n1281\n01:02:25,226 --> 01:02:26,600\nconfigured, okay?\n\n1282\n01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,470\nSo notice it's just a walk-through\n\n1283\n01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:33,120\nin terms of what you actually have\nto do to get it set up, okay?\n\n1284\n01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,940\nSo you enter a PIN number and there you\ngo, and now to encrypt the entire drive.\n\n1285\n01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,730\nAnd it tells you that\nthe encryption is successful, okay.\n\n1286\n01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,320\nSo you go, why is this better?\n\n1287\n01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,970\nWell, remember, this means that\nyou don't actually have to say,\n\n1288\n01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,680\nhey, make sure you turn on BitLocker.\n\n1289\n01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,652\nI don't have to actually worry about\nconfiguring every single step of\n\n1290\n01:02:51,652 --> 01:02:52,760\nthe policy.\n\n1291\n01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,940\nWith MBAM it's gonna\ncreate those policies and\n\n1292\n01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:58,790\nwe're gonna just verify that they're\nactually there and do what we need to.\n\n1293\n01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:00,830\nAnd so it really does make it easier.\n\n1294\n01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:05,860\nNow when I say that, easier on us in terms\nof support because we know with MBAM,\n\n1295\n01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:08,390\nthat means they've set\nit up correctly here.\n\n1296\n01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:12,490\nAnd what we're really worried\nabout is the recovery side of this\n\n1297\n01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:14,540\nrather than all the setup, okay?\n\n1298\n01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,330\nSo there they show you the experience\nhere of what happens when MBAM\n\n1299\n01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:19,820\nis turned on, okay?\n\n1300\n01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:23,370\nSo you simply walk through\nthe wizard is what you do, okay?\n\n1301\n01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,760\nNow, if you're requiring a PIN,\nwe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n1302\n01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,180\nWe already saw this part.\n\n1303\n01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:30,650\nBut where I wanna scroll\ndown to is right here.\n\n1304\n01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:33,980\nAnd actually, this actually shows\nme something I didn't know, okay?\n\n1305\n01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,410\nAnd it's because I don't know\nall the laws around the world.\n\n1306\n01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,970\nBut right here at the top, okay?\n\n1307\n01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:42,170\nIt says, another scenario that MBAM can\nactually help with is when the user\n\n1308\n01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:48,250\ntravels to a region where laws prohibit\nthe use of TPM with BitLocker.\n\n1309\n01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,220\nI never knew that there are but\n\n1310\n01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:54,620\napparently there are particular\nlaws in certain areas,\n\n1311\n01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:58,330\nwhich does not allow you to actually\nbe able to encrypt the drives that way.\n\n1312\n01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:01,660\nAnd you can see why, right, cuz you can\nhide information on your drives, and\n\n1313\n01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:06,050\nthen it's illegal for them to actually go\nin and take that information from you.\n\n1314\n01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:06,800\nSo here it is.\n\n1315\n01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:11,299\n>> You know, Ronnie, so\nthis past year during the summer,\n\n1316\n01:04:11,299 --> 01:04:15,340\nI took a trip to Peru for\nthree weeks with my family.\n\n1317\n01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,800\nAnd I tell you what.\n\n1318\n01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,735\nEvery thumb drive eh, the, this,\nthe laptop, everything I took I,\n\n1319\n01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,420\nI encrypted everything\ndad gum thing on there.\n\n1320\n01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,310\n>> Mm.\n>> You know if anything were to happen\n\n1321\n01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,210\nI mean heck you're out of the country\n>> Ya.\n\n1322\n01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,230\n>> Where you, I mean who knows what done.\n\n1323\n01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:30,710\nYeah, good thing that I never\n\n1324\n01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:31,675\nheard anything like that\n>> Yeah.\n\n1325\n01:04:31,675 --> 01:04:32,557\n[LAUGH]\n>> Cause ev,\n\n1326\n01:04:32,557 --> 01:04:36,370\nevery dag gone piece of electronics I have\nis locked down as tight as I can get it.\n\n1327\n01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:39,750\n>> Yeah.\nSo there you go, and a lot of times it's,\n\n1328\n01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,380\nresuming is pretty much the same nature,\nyou don't worry about it.\n\n1329\n01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,880\nIt works almost clo,\nflawlessly at the point, okay?\n\n1330\n01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,640\nNow here they talk about sending the\ninformation so that, if you are monitoring\n\n1331\n01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,590\nhundreds or thousands of these devices,\nwhether you're talking about BitLocker to\n\n1332\n01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:01,640\ngo, or the IBM, BitLocker devices here,\nthen you can actually send that back.\n\n1333\n01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,680\nAnd it gives you auditing.\n\n1334\n01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,090\nWhere we want to go is actually\nright down here after this.\n\n1335\n01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,520\nOkay.\n\n1336\n01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,700\nThat is the key.\n\n1337\n01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,610\nThat is.\n\n1338\n01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:14,070\nWhat makes this worth it when\nyou have a ton of devices\n\n1339\n01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,880\nthat you're trying to manage, right?\n\n1340\n01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,630\nSo, it even says right\nhere on the very top,\n\n1341\n01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:22,190\nthe primary feature of this [LAUGH] you\nknow, it, why you want to implement it.\n\n1342\n01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,190\nThat's what they're telling you.\n\n1343\n01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:27,380\nWhy in the world you want to implement it\nis the idea, the key recovery here, okay?\n\n1344\n01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:32,640\nAnd it says, where the user has lost\ntheir PIN or password for a drive here.\n\n1345\n01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,820\nAnd that provides right here,\nthat's the key.\n\n1346\n01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,970\nSelf service portal, okay,\nis what we actually have, right?\n\n1347\n01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:43,110\nAllowing users to recover\ntheir own recovery key\n\n1348\n01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,170\nwithout generating additional work.\n\n1349\n01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,810\nI like that, yeah.\n\n1350\n01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,420\nI think that's the,\nthe most amazing thing ever\n\n1351\n01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:53,490\nwhen it doesn't generate any additional\nwork for us is what we have here.\n\n1352\n01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:54,130\nOkay.\n\n1353\n01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:59,370\nSo in that sense, you know, once again,\nif we actually had this all set up,\n\n1354\n01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:04,060\nyou would also end up seeing that\nthere's a self service portal, then,\n\n1355\n01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,230\nwhen you actually lose it,\n\n1356\n01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:09,560\nthen you actually have to type in that\nrecovery key that we talked about.\n\n1357\n01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,740\nThat 48 digits.\n\n1358\n01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:16,640\nNow notice this a little bit funky here\nthis says you must use function keys.\n\n1359\n01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,430\nF1 through F9 for the digits.\n\n1360\n01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:19,050\nGo figure.\n\n1361\n01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:19,680\n>> Yeah.\n\n1362\n01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,220\n>> So it's not just straight up you know,\nkeyboarding it in.\n\n1363\n01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,770\nBut it even tells you what you actually\nhave to do which makes it a bit\n\n1364\n01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:26,960\nmore challenging.\n\n1365\n01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,830\nSo it's not a random generated type of\nthing that you can actually do there.\n\n1366\n01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:33,810\nSo from that point,\nthat is pretty much the,\n\n1367\n01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:37,060\nthe key in getting that,\nthat working out, okay.\n\n1368\n01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:42,280\nSo it automatically really does generate\nthis kind of nice, recovery portal, okay.\n\n1369\n01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,220\nThe rest of it's just explaining how it\ncan actually print it out to a document,\n\n1370\n01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:48,352\nis what it can also do, all right.\n\n1371\n01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:52,320\nYeah, so that's the reason for\nM Band, okay?\n\n1372\n01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,240\nI like it.\n\n1373\n01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,725\nIn that sense,\nI would hate to set it up but I like it.\n\n1374\n01:06:56,725 --> 01:06:58,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah no doubt.\n\n1375\n01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:02,310\nYou know Ronnie, so,\none thing about I just remembered.\n\n1376\n01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:03,480\nThere were two things.\n\n1377\n01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,930\nI well one thing I forgot\nto bring up end of show and\n\n1378\n01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:11,130\nthe second thing is one thing that, I'd,\nyeah, just have it, kind of skipped over.\n\n1379\n01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:15,220\nAll right, so on my machine here,\nso for two things.\n\n1380\n01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:19,680\nOne thing, right, is so this USB drive,\nso even when I entered,\n\n1381\n01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:25,070\nwhen I inserted this USB drive into my\nlaptop, it prompted for that password.\n\n1382\n01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:26,360\nWell it's kind of er,\n\n1383\n01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,060\nannoying, maybe it's some long\ncomplicated password or who knows what.\n\n1384\n01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:34,700\nAnd right click on this guy and\nwe can manage BitLocker and\n\n1385\n01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,830\non the E right down there which is.\n\n1386\n01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:42,810\nMy removable drive, auto unlock,\nI'm going to turn on auto unlock,\n\n1387\n01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,630\nand it's just one little click.\n\n1388\n01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:53,200\nAnd so now, let me just eject the thumb\ndrive, and put it back in delicately.\n\n1389\n01:07:56,892 --> 01:08:02,370\nAll right and so now,\nooh yeah it just pops right up.\n\n1390\n01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,236\nI can browse to it.\n\n1391\n01:08:03,236 --> 01:08:04,123\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1392\n01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:06,820\n[COUGH] I don't have to\nput in that key anymore.\n\n1393\n01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,040\nYou know it kinda, kinda convenient.\n\n1394\n01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:13,450\nAnd whichever laptop that I pop this\nkey in and I put in the password and\n\n1395\n01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:16,140\nI unlock it I will have the option\n\n1396\n01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:18,240\nto auto unlock on that machine\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1397\n01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,620\n>> So if you have a desktop at home or\n\n1398\n01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,540\non your computer\n>> Right.\n\n1399\n01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:24,250\n>> Or something else,\nI can turn this that feature on.\n\n1400\n01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,515\nThe other thing is adding\nthat data recovery agent.\n\n1401\n01:08:27,515 --> 01:08:28,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1402\n01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,840\n>> So, you know, we most of this stuff,\nwe know, we, we focused a lot on\n\n1403\n01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:38,700\ngetting that key out of the active\ndirectory before just setting that.\n\n1404\n01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,230\nRecovery agent.\n\n1405\n01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:45,740\nWe can drill down, so yes back on\nour server, and our group policy.\n\n1406\n01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:51,280\nAnd down into security settings and\npublic key policies.\n\n1407\n01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:51,940\nThere's that guy.\n\n1408\n01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:53,310\nBitLocker drive encryption.\n\n1409\n01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:56,350\n>> Oh, yea.\n>> Now, to add that recovery agent,\n\n1410\n01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:59,330\nright click, and add recovery agent.\n\n1411\n01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,580\nClick on Next.\n\n1412\n01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,300\nEither browse the active directory for\nsomebody.\n\n1413\n01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:08,030\nOr we can browse through\nthe folder to find a .cer file,\n\n1414\n01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:10,060\nwhich is what I did on this one.\n\n1415\n01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,090\nAnd there's key, key.\n\n1416\n01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:16,650\nAnd I had that key on there and then\nit brings me to this guy right here so\n\n1417\n01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:20,240\nwe can, issued, you know,\nto me from, took about CA for\n\n1418\n01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,400\nthe certification of authority,\nand entered that in yesterday for\n\n1419\n01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,455\nit's intended purpose of file recovery and\nthere we go.\n\n1420\n01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:33,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so now, I will be able to use this,\n\n1421\n01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,450\nyou know, my certificate,\n\n1422\n01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:39,160\nthen to unlock drives for\nRonnie's laptop if he loses his key...\n\n1423\n01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,330\n>> That's right.\nWith all Betty in sales.\n\n1424\n01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:42,990\n>> That's right.\nForgetting all that stuff.\n\n1425\n01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:43,515\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1426\n01:09:43,515 --> 01:09:44,270\n>> Okay.\n\n1427\n01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:47,790\nSo remember that this particular\nshow that we've done, right?\n\n1428\n01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,300\nReally is about the idea of,\n\n1429\n01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:54,300\nof how to recover BitLocker when,\nwhen we actually need to, right?\n\n1430\n01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,180\nWe have the manual way,\nwhere we can print the actual file out,\n\n1431\n01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,320\nstore it in a secured location.\n\n1432\n01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,440\nAnd then when we need to,\nif I cannot get back into it cause I\n\n1433\n01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,770\ncan't remember the password that I've set,\nor, you know, something else here.\n\n1434\n01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:10,850\nI can actually go ahead and type that in\nin that in that console, and be able,\n\n1435\n01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,470\nshould get back into the drive.\n\n1436\n01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,130\nOkay.\n\n1437\n01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:17,920\nEven though that's effective it is\nmanagement challenged in terms of\n\n1438\n01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,950\nmaking sure that users do store that\nsecurely, or score their picker, you know,\n\n1439\n01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:28,130\nUSB key securely, or whatever it might be,\nor where, you know, they may not, okay?\n\n1440\n01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,860\nSo, manually, even though we can do it,\n\n1441\n01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:34,190\nit's probably not the best situation\nin most networks that we have.\n\n1442\n01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:38,290\nAnother option, of course,\nis to use the Data Recovery Agent, and\n\n1443\n01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:40,820\nwe see that once we set up\nthe actual group policy and\n\n1444\n01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:46,490\nwe're on domain joined computers,\nit makes it relatively easy, at least for\n\n1445\n01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:51,660\nNate, to be able to receive the call from\nBetty when she actually does complain and\n\n1446\n01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:56,620\nstarts crying to him about the idea\nthat she can't get back into her drive.\n\n1447\n01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,470\nAnd Nate says I don't care.\n\n1448\n01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:00,460\nBut no, Nate would actually go and\nlook it up.\n\n1449\n01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:03,010\nOkay?\nSo, but he would actually not likely have\n\n1450\n01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:07,070\nto do that if he had five or six,\nor let's say fifty calls a day.\n\n1451\n01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:10,120\nJust having to repeat these,\nthese causes a back out, right,\n\n1452\n01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,470\nin terms of the numbers.\n\n1453\n01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:15,390\nNow, in doing that right, Nate could get\nfooled if he actually gets enough calls\n\n1454\n01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:19,137\nhere where he may think he's helping\na user out, but he may be helping the tack\n\n1455\n01:11:19,137 --> 01:11:22,700\naround as well just through some\ntype of social engineering.\n\n1456\n01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:27,280\nFor as good as it is, it does actually\nwork fairly well, but we want to actually\n\n1457\n01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:32,018\nchoose an even more advanced system\nsuch as the idea of, of M band, right.\n\n1458\n01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:34,740\nThe Microsoft BitLocker administration and\n\n1459\n01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:38,480\nmonitoring a set up that\nactually we have there.\n\n1460\n01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,280\nNow that again is actually on\na lot of configuration, but\n\n1461\n01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,980\nremember this means that\na user does do this.\n\n1462\n01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:46,620\nThey can automatically be\nconnected to a portal,\n\n1463\n01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,830\nthat will allow them to\nactually recover it.\n\n1464\n01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:54,490\nAnd they're not actually having to,\nto again, you know, worry too much of\n\n1465\n01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:57,680\nhaving to enter in some other information,\nthat they'll end up receiving.\n\n1466\n01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,710\nAnd then they'll be able to type it in and\nthey'll be ready to go as well.\n\n1467\n01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:01,610\n>> Mmhmm.\n\n1468\n01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:04,630\nSo Ronnie, so now everything that we've\ntalked about with, with BitLocker.\n\n1469\n01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:06,348\n>> Mmhmm.\n>> Are you going to start using BitLocker\n\n1470\n01:12:06,348 --> 01:12:08,020\non your thumb drives and on your laptop?\n\n1471\n01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:10,490\n>> It's possible.\n\n1472\n01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:13,580\nOkay, but probably not right away.\n\n1473\n01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,690\n>> All right, too bad.\n\n1474\n01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:16,450\n>> Yea, it's the idea of taking,\n\n1475\n01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:19,820\nyou know, hours of time away\n>> Right.\n\n1476\n01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,710\n>> When I need to use my computer for.\n\n1477\n01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,250\n>> Well.\n\n1478\n01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,330\nIf.\n>> Encrypting it.\n\n1479\n01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:26,900\n>> If you want, If you do,\nI can be your recovery agent, if you want.\n\n1480\n01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,610\n>> Oh thank you.\n\n1481\n01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,180\n>> I'll be there for\nyou and fulfill that role.\n\n1482\n01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,350\n>> Oh that sounds like a song.\n\n1483\n01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:31,930\nIs it?\n\n1484\n01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:32,890\n>> Maybe.\n\n1485\n01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:33,880\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1486\n01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,070\n>> Oh.\nYeah.\n\n1487\n01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:35,720\n>> Sweet.\n\n1488\n01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n1489\n01:12:37,330

going over,\n\n30\n00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,100\nlet me scroll down in here and\nto the website.\n\n31\n00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,210\nWe're getting down,\n\n32\n00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,420\nonce

operating system itself.\n\n47\n00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,950\nAnd the initial interaction\nwith most of this\n\n48\n00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,490\nis gonna be during the process\nof authentication okay.\n\n49\n00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,910\nAnd then we need to also understand the\nprocess of authorization as well, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,083\nSo, for us,\nthat's where it really begins here.\n\n51\n00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,880\nNow, with mi-, with Windows 8.1 for\n\n52\n00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,835\nus, we actually have more\nthan what we used to have.\n\n53\n00:02:58,835 --> 00:02:59,370\nRight?\n\n54\n00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,795\nWay back, and I'm going to use Nate's\nfavorite phrase here, back in the day.\n\n55\n00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:05,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Way back in the day we,\n\n56\n00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,470\nwe actually had really one\nsolid method of authentication,\n\n57\n00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,570\nwhich was really just user name and\npasswords.\n\n58\n00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,220\nOkay?\n\n59\n00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,300\nBut today though with Windows 8.1, we not\nonly can support the idea of user name\n\n60\n00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,830\npasswords, we can do things like picture\npasswords, we can use certificates.\n\n61\n00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,490\nWe can use biometrics, we can use\nvirtual smart cards, and, and there's,\n\n62\n00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,050\nthere's many more of these aspects that\nwe can actually have a, ahead of us.\n\n63\n00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,270\nSo there's many methods\nof authentication for us.\n\n64\n00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,980\nNow, we start talking about the idea of,\nof authorization a little bit.\n\n65\n00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,960\nOkay, in, in 8.1.\n\n66\n00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,500\nThis is actually telling\nus what we are actually,\n\n67\n00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,490\nthat we're allowed to do,\nwhen we use our, actually go in.\n\n68\n00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,940\nSo authentication for\nus is really basic identity, okay.\n\n69\n00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,630\nAnd remember you actually went over\nthese concepts in the, s, the, 687 show.\n\n70\n00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,940\nOkay, so\nwe're not going to go over those again.\n\n71\n00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,920\nAnd then,\nyou have the idea of authorisation.\n\n72\n00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,150\nWhich again,\nallows you to be where you are, and\n\n73\n00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,540\nto do the things that you\nare actually allowed to do, for us.\n\n74\n00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,430\nAnd so, that's what we have.\n\n75\n00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,590\nSo, when we start talking about\nthe context of authentication and\n\n76\n00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,530\nauthorisation, there's\nreally i guess three\n\n77\n00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,900\ndifferent context that we can talk of.\n\n78\n00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,390\nThis first one is on the individual\nstand alone machine, right.\n\n79\n00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,390\nIf you buy a machine and\n\n80\n00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,910\nyou take it home, you're not really\njoining an active directory domain, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,950\nYou're really just on\nyour own home computer.\n\n82\n00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,200\nSo you might hear about the idea of\nwhat we call local authentication,\n\n83\n00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,110\nwhere you actually log directly\non to the computer, okay?\n\n84\n00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,200\nBut, in a workplace setting.\n\n85\n00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,940\nIf you're part of an active directory\ndomain, you might hear about the idea of\n\n86\n00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,150\nactually needing to actually\nprovide your domain credentials.\n\n87\n00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,380\nIn which, remember that you're actually\nauthenticating against a centralized\n\n88\n00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,080\ndatabase instead.\n\n89\n00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,900\nBut 8.1 also throws another curve\ninto that, as well and, and\n\n90\n00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,590\nWindows 8 also did too.\n\n91\n00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,470\nWhich is, instead of actually logging\non in either one of those two places,\n\n92\n00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,820\nwhere can we log on to?\n\n93\n00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,120\nWe can log on to the world\nof the Microsoft what?\n\n94\n00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,140\n>> What [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n95\n00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,110\n>> Cloud.\n\n96\n00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,740\n>> The cloud?\n\n97\n00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,320\n>> Yeah.\n\n98\n00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,846\n>> Azure?\n>> Yeah\n\n99\n00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:09,824\n>> [CROSSTALK] No,\n\n100\n00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:11,022\nnot really.\nThe,\n\n101\n00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,616\nthe Microsoft account.\n>> Oh.\n\n102\n00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:13,745\n>> Yeah,\n\n103\n00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:18,671\nthe Microsoft account.\n>> I, it's alright.\n\n104\n00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,730\n>> You zoned out.\n\n105\n00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,272\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm in the cloud?\n\n106\n00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:21,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n107\n00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,030\n>> In Tune.\n>> In Tune.\n\n108\n00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,840\n>> But\nwe were going to talk about In Tune later.\n\n109\n00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,500\n>> Yeah we, yeah we are.\n\n110\n00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,060\n>> So that's why I thought\nyou were going for it.\n\n111\n00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,880\n>> But for us here, it is the idea of\nactually using a Microsoft account\n\n112\n00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,840\nin which we're not really logging onto\nour businesses, a domain controller to,\n\n113\n00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,790\nto try and again authenticate and,\nand get authorized here.\n\n114\n00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,870\nNor are we actually again relying on the\ncredentials stored on the local computer.\n\n115\n00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,230\nBut we're now actually gonna send our\ncredentials out to Microsoft, and\n\n116\n00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,910\neverybody loves to, to send their\ncredentials out to Microsoft, right?\n\n117\n00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,000\nSo those are, are kind of three\ncontexts that we're doing.\n\n118\n00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,660\nBut inside of that we can actually\nuse all these different things that,\n\n119\n00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,280\nin this list that Nate just\ntalked about here, okay?\n\n120\n00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,410\nAs we, get started and, and\ncontinued to move through here, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,770\nSo, as we take a look in our first,\n\n122\n00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,300\nfactor here, what we're actually\ngoing to be taking a look at.\n\n123\n00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,150\nWe wanna go ahead and start on the idea\nof multi-factor authentication,\n\n124\n00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,210\nis what we want to be able to do.\n\n125\n00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,314\nEither, either Nate's got an ant down\nhis pants or something, or, or ,or.\n\n126\n00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,320\n>> [LAUGH] What, what?\n\n127\n00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,107\nNo Jason was smiling.\n\n128\n00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:23,607\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm joking.\n\n129\n00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:24,163\n>> And giggling at\n\n130\n00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:24,768\nme.\n>> Okay.\n\n131\n00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:25,268\n>> And I was.\n\n132\n00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:25,965\n>> No, no, that's fine.\n\n133\n00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:27,740\n>> I was returning his, his gaze.\n\n134\n00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,212\n>> So, you know, so, so, let's talk.\n\n135\n00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:29,892\n[LAUGH] Woah,\n\n136\n00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:31,622\nlet's talk about the idea of.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n137\n00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:32,410\n>> Of multi-factor\n\n138\n00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,910\nauthentication a little bit, Nate.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n139\n00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,762\nAll right, so with with multi-factor\n\n140\n00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,028\nauthentication, right, so have, so\nthere's, there's three of them, right?\n\n141\n00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:40,360\n>> Yeah.\n>> Three that you know,\n\n142\n00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,453\nhave at least two of them for\nit to be multi-factor.\n\n143\n00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:43,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n144\n00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,881\n>> And it's something you have,\nsomething you know, and something you are.\n\n145\n00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:47,850\n>> Right.\n\n146\n00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,900\n>> So something, you know,\nright the, a username,\n\n147\n00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,540\na password, a PIN,\nsomething like that something you have,\n\n148\n00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,855\nsome kind of token whether a smart card,\nor something like that.\n\n149\n00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:01,480\n>> yup.\n>> And, something you are, like\n\n150\n00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,200\na fingerprint scanner, you know a retina\nscanner something, something like that.\n\n151\n00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,000\nSo then, combining, at least two of those,\n\n152\n00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,317\nright together is\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n153\n00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:16,670\nAnd Windows 8.1 supports all\nthe different types of yeah,\n\n154\n00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,570\nauthentication in there you know,\nbiometrics,\n\n155\n00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,090\ncompletely supports everything,\nsmart cards, everything's all build in.\n\n156\n00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,120\nAnd, and by built in and fully supporting,\nyou don't need, you don't have to load\n\n157\n00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,730\nin any third party utilities to be\nable to use those, those features.\n\n158\n00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,930\nWindows can manage all that stuff.\n\n159\n00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n160\n00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,060\nIt's amazing at what they've tried to\ndo to really move us away from that\n\n161\n00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,980\nold system of just the idea of\nusername and passwords anymore.\n\n162\n00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,020\nOkay?\nAnd again,\n\n163\n00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,400\nit's not that username is bad and\n\n164\n00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,716\npasswords are bad, it is just\na weaker form of authentication.\n\n165\n00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:51,377\nInstead what is actually\nconsidered better, of course,\n\n166\n00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:55,033\nis to provide multi-factor whereas you\nprovide at least two of these, right?\n\n167\n00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:58,275\nIf you happen to be able to\ngain access to my PIN number,\n\n168\n00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:01,662\nhopefully you're not able to\ngain access to my eyeball.\n\n169\n00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:02,650\nYou know.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,915\n>> We actually do a retinal scan, right?\n\n171\n00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:06,143\nYou just pluck my eyeball out and\nhold it up to the scanner.\n\n172\n00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,431\nNo matter what the movies say it's, I'm\nnot going to make it that easy for you is,\n\n173\n00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:11,690\nis what happens.\n\n174\n00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,390\n>> Right.\nWell, no.\n\n175\n00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n176\n00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,203\n>> Somebody I, I think it was,\nwas Adam Gordon.\n\n177\n00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,376\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So Adam Gordon, he was a,\n\n178\n00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:16,899\na speech\n>> Yep.\n\n179\n00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,192\n>> security guy, and he was saying\nsomething about that whenever you pluck\n\n180\n00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:23,029\nthe eyeball out of somebody's eye,\nsomething happens to it and so\n\n181\n00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,261\nit doesn't actually work.\n\n182\n00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,100\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n183\n00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,672\nI haven't tried that on my own so\nI'm gonna trust Adam.\n\n184\n00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:30,365\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n185\n00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:31,654\n>> I'll leave that to him.\n\n186\n00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:32,199\n>> Alright, yeah.\n\n187\n00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:34,277\nThat works.\nMaybe, nevermind, we won't get into it.\n\n188\n00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:34,898\n>> No, I understand.\n\n189\n00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:35,924\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But yeah,\n\n190\n00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:38,670\nmulti-factor authentication\nis a big one for us.\n\n191\n00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,066\nSo, we want to make sure\nthat we understand.\n\n192\n00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,799\nWe're going to just kind of list\na few of the different ones that,\n\n193\n00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,748\nthat we can actually use\nwith Windows 8 here.\n\n194\n00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:48,757\nAnd then we'll talk about it, and\ntalk about some of the issues that we may\n\n195\n00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,547\nface with it is what we want\nto take a look at, okay?\n\n196\n00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:53,509\n>> Yeah, so, certificates.\n\n197\n00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:58,169\nOkay, yeah, so we can load up\ncertificates and now like, all right, so\n\n198\n00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:01,783\nRonnie said we can use that\nto to verify who we are.\n\n199\n00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:03,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right.\n\n200\n00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,394\nNo, certifica, certificates can be issued\nby a CA on the domain, and smart cards,\n\n201\n00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:09,947\nnow, you know, smart cards or\nvirtual smart cards,\n\n202\n00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:13,050\nthere's another item here\nthat's called out on the exam.\n\n203\n00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,161\nAnd smart cards they\nalso use certificates.\n\n204\n00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:16,666\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n205\n00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:21,443\n>> As a way, a way to confirm that\nthat you are who you are, right?\n\n206\n00:09:21,443 --> 00:09:22,910\n>> Yeah.\n\n207\n00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,550\nYeah.\n\n208\n00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,060\nIn terms of certificates for us,\n\n209\n00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,870\nright, this is really the whole idea,\nof replacing truly the,\n\n210\n00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,420\nthe ridding of somebody actually\nhaving to remember passwords, right?\n\n211\n00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,440\nIf I can go ahead and\nactually get a certificate issued to me.\n\n212\n00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,130\nThat does verify my particular identity,\nthat someone can actually go and\n\n213\n00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,670\nask that certificate authority, and\nsay hey, did you issue this to this guy?\n\n214\n00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,220\nYes.\nOkay,\n\n215\n00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,510\nso, we can actually verify that for us.\n\n216\n00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,060\nNow for us to be able to do that,\nof course, means that we\n\n217\n00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,790\nare either gonna have a certificate\nauthority inside of our network, okay.\n\n218\n00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,500\nMost people at home are not gonna\nhave that or we're gonna be going out\n\n219\n00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,650\nto the internet here to a third\nparty certificate authority and\n\n220\n00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,670\nbeing able to verify it there, okay?\n\n221\n00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,640\nSo, this actually gives us that ability\nwithout me ever having to type in\n\n222\n00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,610\na password that I can, my machine can\npresent that certificate for me and\n\n223\n00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,193\nit can be validated, okay?\n\n224\n00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:15,159\nAnd then my credentials are normally good,\nokay?\n\n225\n00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,510\nSo, that is one of\nthe methods that we can use.\n\n226\n00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,994\nNow the other problem with that\nidea of the certificate though,\n\n227\n00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,964\nis that if somebody can\ncompromise that certificate,\n\n228\n00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:27,260\nthen we're actually going\nto have an issue, okay?\n\n229\n00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,900\nSo a lot of times for us here, we got to\nactually protect that certificate that has\n\n230\n00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,950\nour private key, you know, as well as the\npublic key that we can issue out and, and\n\n231\n00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,800\ndo whatever we need to to, but we have\nto make sure that we actually keep that\n\n232\n00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,890\nprivate key secured as much as possible.\n\n233\n00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,770\nAnd a lot of times we don't think about\nit, but private keys can become corrupt,\n\n234\n00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,372\nokay, or somebody can actually simply\nget access to your machine and\n\n235\n00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:51,140\nthey can get access to\nyour certificate store.\n\n236\n00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,590\nThey may even also be able to just\nmake a copy of it and there you go,\n\n237\n00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,929\nyou actually would have\nan issue at that point too.\n\n238\n00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,930\nNow Nate also mentioned the idea\nof virtual smart cards here, okay?\n\n239\n00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,290\nVirtual smart cards make this another\nfactor that we can actually use.\n\n240\n00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,360\nSo, instead of actually having\na physical card, usually for\n\n241\n00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,120\nus the idea of the virtual smart card\nliterally ties down the authentication\n\n242\n00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,110\nif we choose to for\nthat machine to that one device, okay?\n\n243\n00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,910\nSo it doesn't allow somebody to\ntransfer it over to any place here.\n\n244\n00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,400\nThe virtual Smartcard is essentially\nstored on that device here and so\n\n245\n00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,890\nif you don't have that device, you being\nable to actually put a certificate on\n\n246\n00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,680\nanything else it, it,\nit was lined up to that.\n\n247\n00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,160\nThat's pretty much it, okay?\n\n248\n00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,770\nSo it does make it much more difficult in,\nin that sense, for, for\n\n249\n00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,120\nsomeone to be able to, still to be\nable to actually have it stored there.\n\n250\n00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,390\nSo that way, as long as you actually\nuse that machine to authenticate,\n\n251\n00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,545\nyou're good, yep.\n\n252\n00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:42,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n253\n00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,641\nNow to so\nwith these virtual smart cards, right?\n\n254\n00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,242\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Pretty sweet and, and it,\n\n255\n00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:47,108\nit's just that.\n\n256\n00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:52,844\nIt's ba, basically a, a smart card\nthat is stored in the TPM on a device.\n\n257\n00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:55,369\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right, now there's a, a few things,\n\n258\n00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:59,230\nthat need to, need to happen in order\nto use these virtual smart cards.\n\n259\n00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,680\nAll right, for one, it has to be on\na computer that has joined to the domain.\n\n260\n00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,540\n>> Yep, that's a good thing.\n\n261\n00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,450\n>> It's gotta be joined to the domain.\n\n262\n00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,230\nAnd it must have a TPM chip inside.\n\n263\n00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,437\nNow unlike BitLocker, where BitLocker,\n\n264\n00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:14,132\nif you don't have a TPM you\ncan kind of get around it,\n\n265\n00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:18,840\nyou know and use a USB key here or\nsome other way or just a simple password.\n\n266\n00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,378\nWith a virtual smart card, yeah no way.\n\n267\n00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:24,430\nSo that certificate is\nstored inside there.\n\n268\n00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,945\nNow, with a Windows 8.1 machine, right,\nas far as connected smart cards,\n\n269\n00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:34,718\nit can only support up to ten smart\ncards connected at one time and\n\n270\n00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:37,046\nthese are physical and virtual.\n\n271\n00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,909\nNow it, ten.\n\n272\n00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:39,431\n>> Yeah.\n\n273\n00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:43,049\n>> Now, now Ronnie can, can you think of\na situation where there would be ten smart\n\n274\n00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:45,056\ncards connected at one\ntime into a machine.\n\n275\n00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,675\n>> Well, believe it or not,\nit is probably possible.\n\n276\n00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:50,080\n[LAUGH] But a lot of times, right, for\n\n277\n00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,620\nus, the idea is that if we're inside\nof a domain, we may actually have\n\n278\n00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,760\npeople that are actually roaming\nbetween different computers, right.\n\n279\n00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,530\nAnd so, they need to be able to store\ntheir particular credentials on\n\n280\n00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,910\nmultiple machines.\n\n281\n00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:07,389\nNow if I limit to only particular smart,\ncertificate to that smart card,\n\n282\n00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:13,080\nthe virtual smart card again or the, the\nTPM, I should say, if I limit it to that,\n\n283\n00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,040\nthen only one user would actually\nbe able to use that one machine.\n\n284\n00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,710\nSo, the idea of actually being able\nto move from one, you know, the third\n\n285\n00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,310\nfloor to the first floor and get access\nto your resource, probably not as easy.\n\n286\n00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,020\nSo, yes, you might actually see\nwhere you'll probably see up to the,\n\n287\n00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,760\nthe ten users a lot of times in that work\nenvironment where, where it may happen.\n\n288\n00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,660\nNot very often, maybe on, you know,\nlike, like Nate's computer, but.\n\n289\n00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,360\n>> Hm.\n>> You know,\n\n290\n00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,910\ncause he's kind of one the top dogs here.\n\n291\n00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,450\nBut on, on, on one of,\non one of us, right, the,\n\n292\n00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,380\nthe people that just work here.\n\n293\n00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,174\nYou now a, a normal guy like me,\nyou might see 15 people using the.\n\n294\n00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:44,358\n[LAUGH] you know.\n>> At the same time.\n\n295\n00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,267\n>> Yeah.\n>> Like move and shove you out of,\n\n296\n00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,301\nout of your chair.\n\n297\n00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:48,496\n>> Just, just shove you out,\nright out, that's right.\n\n298\n00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:52,949\n>> Man, that's that's too bad\n>> Well, all right, so for\n\n299\n00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:56,290\na virtual smart card,\nnow it can store 30 certificates.\n\n300\n00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,284\n>> Yeah.\n>> and one virtual smart card and\n\n301\n00:13:58,284 --> 00:13:59,710\nthat's quite a few.\n\n302\n00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,220\n>> It is.\n\n303\n00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,645\n>> Now, if you have a, a user, let's say\nthis user is roaming between devices as\n\n304\n00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:08,520\na desktop computer and a laptop or\nsomething, or, or two laptops.\n\n305\n00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,440\nI mean, who really has two laptops?\n\n306\n00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,050\nThat's crazy but maybe somebody does.\n\n307\n00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,900\nNow a, a certificate would have\nto be issued to both devices.\n\n308\n00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,310\nSo, once it gets loaded up into the TMP,\nthat's it.\n\n309\n00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,450\nIt, it's in there.\n\n310\n00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,460\n>> It's in there.\n>> It's not really exportable.\n\n311\n00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,780\nYou can't eject it and\nsomehow take it with you and\n\n312\n00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,040\nthen pop it into the next one.\n\n313\n00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n314\n00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,055\n>> Now it it does also work out well for\nlike, roaming users.\n\n315\n00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:32,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, so,\n\n316\n00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,370\nlet's say you have a user on a laptop and\nhe's going out.\n\n317\n00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,030\nAnd let's say this user needs\nto get into a company VPN.\n\n318\n00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,976\n>> Right.\n>> Well, let's say the company says, well,\n\n319\n00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:44,025\nyou can only use\n>> That one.\n\n320\n00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:46,478\n>> this computer to access\nthe company resources, right?\n\n321\n00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:49,400\nMaybe they've got NPS or something-\n>> Right.\n\n322\n00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,515\n>> You know, on to it and,\nand helping things out.\n\n323\n00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,067\nSo by loading on that first,\non the virtual smart card and\n\n324\n00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,266\nlocking that you know, that device down to\n>> Hm.\n\n325\n00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:58,809\n>> where you can only use it to log in.\n\n326\n00:14:58,809 --> 00:14:59,865\nThen you, you know,\n\n327\n00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,410\nthat company can ensure\n>> Right.\n\n328\n00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,228\n>> that the user is not, you know,\nloading up his credentials on\n\n329\n00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:04,785\n>> Yeah.\n\n330\n00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:06,390\n>> some untrusted computer out there.\n\n331\n00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,610\nAnd, you know, I mean, yeah.\n\n332\n00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,080\nYou can use it that way as well.\n\n333\n00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,940\nYeah, and, and\nagain this is a great security\n\n334\n00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,780\nbenefit of using something like Windows\n8 and 8.1 to really help us out here.\n\n335\n00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,860\nTo be able to limit the devices that are\nactually going to be able to authenticate\n\n336\n00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,780\nby using this idea of\nmulti-factoral authentication.\n\n337\n00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,680\nNow, we, we do have a coworker of ours,\n\n338\n00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,480\nMike, he, he absolutely hates this idea of\nthe virtual smart card because he really\n\n339\n00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,370\ndoesn't believe that it actually is a\nsecondary device like an actual you know,\n\n340\n00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,850\ncommon access card or anything like that,\ncuz he says, well, it's all ready there.\n\n341\n00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,337\nWell, again, remember it's multi factor\nbecause it does normally require a pin.\n\n342\n00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:40,964\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n343\n00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:43,942\n>> Something that you have or that you\nknow and then also the device itself.\n\n344\n00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,788\nSo there's multi factor in that sense.\n\n345\n00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:46,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n346\n00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,328\nYeah, and, you know, using a virtual\nsmart card, it does indeed require a pin.\n\n347\n00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:53,081\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah, at, at least something else.\n\n348\n00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,680\n>> Right.\n>> You can't do it with just,\n\n349\n00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,036\njust a virtual smart card.\n\n350\n00:15:56,036 --> 00:16:00,235\nNow let's say there is something\nwrong with the virtual smart card.\n\n351\n00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:01,278\n>> Mm.\nSomething wrong.\n\n352\n00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,125\nThere is a command line utility-\n>> Right.\n\n353\n00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:07,096\n>> That you can use to get in there and\nmess with it, and look for things and\n\n354\n00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,080\nstuff it does.\n\n355\n00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,295\n>> Yeah, let's go ahead and\ncheck that out since Nate already has it-\n\n356\n00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:10,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n357\n00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,200\n>> Ready to go.\n\n358\n00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,710\n>> Yep.\nAll right, so for\n\n359\n00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,800\nthat guy, say we'll save that for\nsomething else.\n\n360\n00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,318\nSo let's, that one, that one, mm-hm.\n\n361\n00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:19,999\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n362\n00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,770\nLet me make this just a little bit larger.\n\n363\n00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,460\nOh.\n\n364\n00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,450\nRight now is the fastest flip into\nthe command prompt I had ever seen.\n\n365\n00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,400\nYou're awesome.\n\n366\n00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,900\n>> 20, can you see that one Ronnie?\n\n367\n00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,260\n>> I can see that one, barely.\n\n368\n00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,930\n>> All right.\n\n369\n00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,640\n>> But it's cuz I'm old.\n\n370\n00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:42,510\n>> And so this one is tpmvscmgr.exe.\n\n371\n00:16:44,857 --> 00:16:47,746\n>> All right.\n>> Oh, that's right, there's one command.\n\n372\n00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:51,142\nAll right so, all right so there we go.\n\n373\n00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:52,511\nThat is the command.\n\n374\n00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,150\n>> Yep.\n\n375\n00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,580\n>> And now I don't have virtual smart\ncards on, on this, on this computer, and\n\n376\n00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,520\nI thought about it, you know,\nwhen prepping for this since these, both,\n\n377\n00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,050\nmine and Ronnie's laptops here,\nit does have a TPM inside.\n\n378\n00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,830\nAnd so I thought man, you know I should\nreally bring up a certificate of authority\n\n379\n00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,949\nand issue out some certificates and\nroll Ronnie in there and.\n\n380\n00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,276\n>> Yeah.\n>> Lock his computer down [INAUDIBLE].\n\n381\n00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:17,894\n>> That's right.\n>> Anyhow, with, with this command here.\n\n382\n00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:21,519\nYou can browse through, check it out,\nyou know, read some of these,\n\n383\n00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,206\nthese switches and options that you\ncan do to it to give some feedback and\n\n384\n00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:27,820\nbe able to manage that virtual smart card.\n\n385\n00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n386\n00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,380\n>> And check out the status of it and\nstuff.\n\n387\n00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,870\n>> Yeah.\nOne of the keys here, right,\n\n388\n00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,100\nis if you haven't seen this command\nbefore make sure you actually do launch\n\n389\n00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,060\nit and take a look.\n\n390\n00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,010\nThose examples are gonna\nbe really helpful for you.\n\n391\n00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,010\nI would say if you actually do take a look\nat them, especially in preparation for\n\n392\n00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,824\nthe exam here, about the idea of creating\nan actual smart card when needed.\n\n393\n00:17:47,824 --> 00:17:51,016\nIf you're actually make this,\nparticular device to actually be used,\n\n394\n00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:52,355\nwith your domain settings here.\n\n395\n00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:53,520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n396\n00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720\nYeah, you know, and\ngoodness, you know, and\n\n397\n00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,780\nwith a lot of these command line\nutilities and everything, it, you know,\n\n398\n00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,900\nhalf the battle is just knowing-\n>> Knowing what it is.\n\n399\n00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,470\n>> What it is that you can do.\n\n400\n00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,335\nYou know?\nAnd, I mean, heaven sakes,\n\n401\n00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,170\nwhen there's switches, and modifiers,\n\n402\n00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,040\nand you know, pipe stuff into\nwhatever commands and I mean, it's,\n\n403\n00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,680\nthere's a lot of things out there, but-\n>> Yeah.\n\n404\n00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,630\nJust being aware of what you can do and\nwhich utility you can do it with is, yeah,\n\n405\n00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,220\nI mean, half, half the battle.\n\n406\n00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n407\n00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,920\nYeah it is.\n>> All right?\n\n408\n00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,680\n>> Okay.\n\n409\n00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,010\nSo we've also mentioned the idea of\ncertificates and we wanna make sure that\n\n410\n00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,340\nyou actually understand that a lot of\ntimes when you're issued a certificate\n\n411\n00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,615\nyou do have to install that certificate on\nthe actual machine for it to work as well.\n\n412\n00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:31,230\nMm-hm.\n\n413\n00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,650\n>> So we wanna do that one\nas well right now, or?\n\n414\n00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,900\n>> Yeah, yeah let's do it right now.\n\n415\n00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,420\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, so, so on this machine here,\n\n416\n00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,200\nright, so,\n\n417\n00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,845\nyou know Ronnie, that, that security thing\nthat was in the news, right, Heartbleed?\n\n418\n00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:42,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Have you heard of that?\n\n419\n00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,020\n>> The Heartbleed, yes\n>> So with Heartbleed,\n\n420\n00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,740\nit's you can look it up, we won't go real\nin-depth into it, but it was you know,\n\n421\n00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,360\nit had to deal with OpenSSL and\nthere was a vulnerability in there\n\n422\n00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,990\nthat people could,\nit could even leak the private keys.\n\n423\n00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,360\n>> Right.\n>> You know, to one,\n\n424\n00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,255\nstory said it couldn't, and\nit was like update, actually, yes, it can.\n\n425\n00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:04,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, to at my house,\n\n426\n00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:10,210\nI have a firewall set up, and I use open\nVPN to connect to, to my house, right?\n\n427\n00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,440\nAnd so, I mean, there's nothing really at\nmy house that I think is real high target,\n\n428\n00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,430\nbut nonetheless the firewall\nI use is pfSense.\n\n429\n00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,360\nAnd pfSense they updated the,\nthe software for\n\n430\n00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,860\nit to repair this heart,\nHeartbleed vulnerability in there.\n\n431\n00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,210\nAnd so\nI updated the the software onto it, and\n\n432\n00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,230\nso I issued out new certificates,\nto my devices.\n\n433\n00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,830\nI use to VPN into, yeah,\nthe network of the house.\n\n434\n00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,215\nSo, now to do that, so\nI have a news certificate.\n\n435\n00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:42,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so, I should take the certificate\n\n436\n00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,260\nand put it into my certificate store.\n\n437\n00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,090\n>> Right.\n>> So I can\n\n438\n00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,090\nuse this to authenticate myself.\n\n439\n00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,993\n>> Okay.\n>> And log in.\n\n440\n00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:51,145\nSo on this machine here,\nthis is my real machine.\n\n441\n00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:57,005\nWhat we'll do is we'll\nopen up the certificate\n\n442\n00:19:57,005 --> 00:20:01,112\nstore and that is certmgr.msc.\n\n443\n00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:04,905\nAnd, hm,\n\n444\n00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:09,130\nall right.\n\n445\n00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,930\nAnd, now to import a certificate all\nright, so whether it's in the, the, the,\n\n446\n00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,460\ntrusted route if it was for like the,\n\n447\n00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,160\nthe web management page\n>> Mm-hm\n\n448\n00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,930\n>> And I could stick it in there, but for\n\n449\n00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,810\nme, right, or for, you know,\n\n450\n00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,950\nthe certificate that we're working with\nnow, it's gonna go in the personal.\n\n451\n00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:30,840\nSo I can highlight it and right click,\nand choose All Tasks > Import.\n\n452\n00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,800\nAll right, it's grayed out since\nI am with the current user.\n\n453\n00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,089\nWe can click on Next, and\nnow I need to find that certificate.\n\n454\n00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,810\nSo browse and this will be in,\n\n455\n00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:45,070\njust stick on this little thumb drive and\nI didn't, all right?\n\n456\n00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:50,990\nAnd it isn't there in the config,\nAll files,\n\n457\n00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,350\nthere that guy is right there,\nopen him up and click on Next.\n\n458\n00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,980\nAw man.\n\n459\n00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,770\n>> Oh no.\n>> Yeah,\n\n460\n00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:03,568\nit has this big long super password for\nit too.\n\n461\n00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:04,808\n[LAUGH].\n\n462\n00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:07,289\nI'd have to get into\nLastPass to go do that.\n\n463\n00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:09,187\n>> It's all right.\n\n464\n00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:10,156\n>> To go dig that thing out.\n\n465\n00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:12,760\nBut, but anyhow, so yeah.\n\n466\n00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,680\nSo you know, this, this had to go get\nthat, that key for it, which, yeah, it's,\n\n467\n00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,550\nit's buried.\n\n468\n00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,220\nIt's really long.\n\n469\n00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,200\nI didn't memorize it.\n\n470\n00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> But, yeah,\n\n471\n00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,950\nthe key though in the, the password there.\n\n472\n00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,220\nAnd it'll import the certificate into\nyour, your cer, your certificate store.\n\n473\n00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,980\n>> Right.\n>> And that's stored in your, you know,\n\n474\n00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,880\nyour profile there, and\n>> So\n\n475\n00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,100\nthat way when I go to,\naccess the open VPN then it will,\n\n476\n00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,970\nlook for the certificate and\nvalidate that I am who I am.\n\n477\n00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, let me get in there.\n\n478\n00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,530\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n479\n00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,620\n>> Yeah, so for us here.\n\n480\n00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,520\nA lot of times, if you actually\nare experiencing issues with certificates,\n\n481\n00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,020\nnormally we don't, but if you are,\n\n482\n00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,220\nmake sure that you do have the certificate\nthat you're actually supposed to have\n\n483\n00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,850\nInside that certificate store is really\nthe key when it comes down to it.\n\n484\n00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,660\nBut, since Nate's not able to do that,\nhe will not be, no, kidding, yeah, so\n\n485\n00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,680\nthere you go, yeah.\n\n486\n00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,677\n>> All right, well as far as multi\nfactor authentication, all right so,\n\n487\n00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:08,250\non the exam, it does call out a,\nanother method.\n\n488\n00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,870\nRight?\n\n489\n00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,110\nPicture passwords.\n\n490\n00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n491\n00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,400\n>> Now, we did cover picture\npasswords pretty in-depth in the,\n\n492\n00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,540\nthe 687 set of shows.\n\n493\n00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you know, how to set them up and\n\n494\n00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,740\nwhere to go in the, and the, and the\ngestures, and all those sorts of things.\n\n495\n00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,880\nNow, with picture\npasswords is a quick recap.\n\n496\n00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,000\nIt's, it allows you to use a picture,\nand on that picture, you know, and\n\n497\n00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,640\nit it best practice is that it\nshould be a, a busy picture, right?\n\n498\n00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,320\n>> Right.\n>> Or a picture with many points of\n\n499\n00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,790\ninterest, or POIs.\n\n500\n00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> A kind of funny acronym that\n\n501\n00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,320\nwas in the, the writeup.\n\n502\n00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,740\nBut yeah, so a picture with\na lot of points of interest,\n\n503\n00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,570\nand then there's three gestures\nthat you can do, right?\n\n504\n00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,425\nYou can do a, a circle, a line and a dot.\n\n505\n00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:53,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now the line, right, the line can be,\n\n506\n00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,470\nyou know, all different ways and\ndifferent lengths.\n\n507\n00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,070\nThe dot is always just a dot.\n\n508\n00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,560\nAnd the circle can be little circles,\nbig circles, and\n\n509\n00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,360\nit can be counterclockwise or\nclockwise circles.\n\n510\n00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,590\n>> Yeah directionality is important.\n\n511\n00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,500\n>> Directionality, directionality?\n\n512\n00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,300\nIs that?\n\n513\n00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,370\n>> It is a word.\n>> I thought you were good at Scrabble.\n\n514\n00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,390\n>> No.\n>> I know, I was,\n\n515\n00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,940\nI was always just poor at Scrabble.\n\n516\n00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,511\n>> Hm.\n\n517\n00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:18,229\n>> Anyways.\n\n518\n00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:21,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So the directionality matters.\n\n519\n00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,670\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n520\n00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:27,350\n>> Now, some people kind of claim that\npicture passwords are very secure.\n\n521\n00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,550\nAnd other people claim they are not so\nsecure.\n\n522\n00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, Ronnie,\n\n523\n00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,950\nlet me get your opinion on it right now,\ndo you use picture passwords?\n\n524\n00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,530\n>> I do use picture passwords.\n\n525\n00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,120\n>> Now, how do you feel about\nthe security of that picture password?\n\n526\n00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,830\n>> Well, again, that's,\n\n527\n00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,930\none of those things which is\na little unusual here, right?\n\n528\n00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,400\nThe idea of actually having a username and\n\n529\n00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,700\npassword for us is actually\nfairly a secure combination.\n\n530\n00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,160\nOkay, it's not the most secure, but again,\n\n531\n00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,935\nyou might be able to guess my username,\nshouldn't be able to guess my password.\n\n532\n00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,365\nYou might be able to guess the password,\nbut\n\n533\n00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:57,385\nnot associate with my\nparticular user name.\n\n534\n00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:59,096\nSo there's a lot of combinations there.\n\n535\n00:23:59,096 --> 00:24:03,652\nBut from what I've actually understood\nand, and read about picture passwords is\n\n536\n00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:08,406\nthat there are more challenges to that\nBecause you're now actually introducing\n\n537\n00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:12,896\na ton of different possible points along\nwith different gestures which actually\n\n538\n00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:17,585\nmakes the combination much higher than the\npossible combination of passwords that I\n\n539\n00:24:17,585 --> 00:24:20,900\ncould come up with,\neven on a regular keyboard.\n\n540\n00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n541\n00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,890\nYeah, you know, and with picture\npasswords you just get five tries.\n\n542\n00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,370\n>> And that's it.\n>> There's five tries to\n\n543\n00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,700\nget that thing wrong and\nthen it's no longer an option.\n\n544\n00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, and\n\n545\n00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,870\nso, you can't only have\njust a picture password.\n\n546\n00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,740\nSo, it's always a picture password and\n\n547\n00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,710\na PIN,or picture password and,\nyou know, a regular password.\n\n548\n00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,630\nYou know, a string of characters.\n\n549\n00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,880\nSo, you get five tries on that picture\npassword, and it locks that option out.\n\n550\n00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,390\n>> Does it?\n\n551\n00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,820\n>> So, then you have to type in,\n\n552\n00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,310\nyou know, your string of characters\nyour regular, regular password.\n\n553\n00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n554\n00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,040\nSo, the idea that picture password, if you\ndo wanna use it, that's perfectly fine.\n\n555\n00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,760\nBut remember that, in a business,\nunless they tell you what pic or\n\n556\n00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,530\nauthentication method you're gonna use,\nit's not gonna be a real choice for you.\n\n557\n00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,220\nNow, when people do actually have\nproblems with the picture passwords,\n\n558\n00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,920\nit normally is the idea that they've\nforgotten what gestures that they've used,\n\n559\n00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,105\nor they can't remember.\n\n560\n00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:17,380\nBecause they can't remember they actually,\nyou know, click on the wrong thing, or\n\n561\n00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,020\nthey, they do the wrong finger swipe for\nwhatever.\n\n562\n00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,820\nIt might be in terms of\nacross that picture.\n\n563\n00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,840\nThey get tired and\nover on the left hand side of the screen,\n\n564\n00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,480\nyou're gonna see that it\nsays use a password instead.\n\n565\n00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,720\nMost people probably forget and they\njust do that and just never turn it off.\n\n566\n00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,480\nSo, so\n\n567\n00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,420\nagain, if you do happen to forget that,\nit's gonna actually be a bad day for you.\n\n568\n00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,320\nYou know, after awhile your just gonna\nkeep having do a essentially a two step\n\n569\n00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,320\npassword process all the time when you\njust click on that button that says hey,\n\n570\n00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,040\ngo ahead and do this.\n\n571\n00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,080\nNow, some of the other requirements and\nsome of the other kind of issues of\n\n572\n00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,124\ncourse, is that people want to do this\non their regular workstation computers.\n\n573\n00:25:52,124 --> 00:25:52,624\n>> Okay.\n\n574\n00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:53,372\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n575\n00:25:53,372 --> 00:25:56,780\nThey can if they have that\nmuch control with their mouse.\n\n576\n00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,300\nIt was really designed for\nthe idea of an interactive log on\n\n577\n00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,950\nsuch as a touch screen more\nthan anything else, right?\n\n578\n00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,587\nSo, so don't get me wrong, you can do it\nas long as you're actually very good with\n\n579\n00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:11,506\nthose swipes and those gestures there,\nwith your clicker or mouse.\n\n580\n00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:14,638\nBut if not, it becomes more of\na challenge than you realize.\n\n581\n00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:17,250\n>> Mm-hm.\nNow another thing, You know,\n\n582\n00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,400\nif you are using ,using your fingers,\nso these are touch screen laptops.\n\n583\n00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,450\n>> Mm -hm.\n>> And so, you know,\n\n584\n00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,834\nI use picture passwords and know it's just\n[SOUND] you know, it's really convenient,\n\n585\n00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:30,559\nreally easy and you know my password\nis pretty long kind of complicated but\n\n586\n00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,085\ncharacters and everything.\n\n587\n00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:34,080\nIt's kind of a pain sometimes, but\n\n588\n00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,218\nit's really easy just to [SOUND]\njust to tap three spots.\n\n589\n00:26:37,218 --> 00:26:37,786\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n590\n00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:40,510\n>> And yeah, and go on now.\n\n591\n00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,570\nWe can turn off with your passwords.\n\n592\n00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,590\n>> Right.\n>> We can control it.\n\n593\n00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,150\nSo if in some organization you don't\nwant to use picture passwords for\n\n594\n00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,710\nwhatever reason,\nI find them extremely convenient and easy.\n\n595\n00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,470\nThere is a policy setting that\nwe can turn those guys off.\n\n596\n00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,640\nAnd if jump into good old gpedit.msc.\n\n597\n00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:08,020\nThen we drill down into\nthe computer configuration,\n\n598\n00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,485\nadministrative templates and into system.\n\n599\n00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,910\nAnd into log on.\n\n600\n00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,540\nAnd it is, turn off picture.\n\n601\n00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,680\nThere it is.\n>> Third one.\n\n602\n00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,890\n>> Third one down.\n\n603\n00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,530\nTurn off picture password sign in.\n\n604\n00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,110\nSo we can enable that and so\nnow it will disable the ability to use.\n\n605\n00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,954\nA picture password.\n\n606\n00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:33,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n607\n00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,100\n>> And of course, you know,\nthis sale doesn't really do anything and\n\n608\n00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,422\nnot configure doesn't really do anything.\n\n609\n00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:41,688\nBut yeah, so\nwe can turn it off if we want them.\n\n610\n00:27:41,688 --> 00:27:43,030\nAnd also, while we're in here,\n\n611\n00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,190\nwe didn't specifically call it out, but\nthere is the pin sign on right above it.\n\n612\n00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,780\nSo if you did want to use a pin, right,\nfour digit pin or what have you that\n\n613\n00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,840\nyou can turn this on and now this will\nappear as an option to sign in with.\n\n614\n00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,200\nNow of course, if you do enable the,\nthe picture password\n\n615\n00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,060\nto sign in with it you don't have to\nreally you know, give it anything else.\n\n616\n00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,840\nI mean, just circle ethereal gestures and\nlocks it.\n\n617\n00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,584\nSo it's not like you have to circle it,\nand enter a pin, and enter anything else.\n\n618\n00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:17,648\nKind of one stop thing.\n\n619\n00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:19,320\n>> Yeah.\nSo usually for us,\n\n620\n00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,760\nlike we said,\na lot of times you might find out\n\n621\n00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,780\nyou can't use the picture password if\nthat particular setting was turned on or\n\n622\n00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,470\ncontrolled by let say group policy and\nturned with your active directory domain.\n\n623\n00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,530\nSo, even though it might seem neat to use,\nagain your security\n\n624\n00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:37,430\npolicy will actually tell you whether or\nnot you can actually use it or not.\n\n625\n00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,950\nOkay?\n\n626\n00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,190\nNow, lets go and show where we actually\ngo and turn on the picture passwords,\n\n627\n00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,880\nif we showed them how to turn them off.\n\n628\n00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,245\nThis is pretty much what we want to do.\n\n629\n00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:45,230\nOkay?\n\n630\n00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:50,635\nSo, if we take a look here on my computer,\non my Windows 8.1, here.\n\n631\n00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:52,790\nOkay.\n\n632\n00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,460\nSo, all right.\n\n633\n00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,890\nOver on the left-hand side of the screen,\nI'm going to swipe, and\n\n634\n00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,120\nyou're going to actually\nsee my charm bar here.\n\n635\n00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,431\nAnd we might have to full screen that so\nthat we can see, here, and\n\n636\n00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:12,224\nover on the right hand side,\nlower left hand corner, I go to settings,\n\n637\n00:29:12,224 --> 00:29:16,979\nand then, we can go down to\nwhere it says change PC settings\n\n638\n00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,980\nYou might have to do your real computer.\n\n639\n00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,910\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n640\n00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,304\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n641\n00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:29,910\n>> Oops.\n\n642\n00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,670\n>> All right, it's not gonna let me do it.\n\n643\n00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,160\nOh yeah, something else that\nwe're going to get to later.\n\n644\n00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,300\n>> Yeah.\nSorry.\n\n645\n00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,650\n>> That's fine.\n>> I'm trying to close, all right.\n\n646\n00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:42,880\nSo, maybe that wasn't the best idea.\n\n647\n00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,240\nHere, from here,\nare we gonna do picture passwords later?\n\n648\n00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,902\n>> No.\n\n649\n00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:51,170\nNo, that, that was for a,\na separate, separate segment.\n\n650\n00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:51,940\n>> Oh, sorry.\n\n651\n00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,450\n>> Hm?\n\n652\n00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,030\n>> Yeah.\n\n653\n00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,050\nSo, it's from here that\nyou could actually go and\n\n654\n00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,180\nyou can see where it says to\ncreate a picture password.\n\n655\n00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,700\nSo, we don't actually have any pictures,\n\n656\n00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,665\nit would require me to\ntake a silly picture.\n\n657\n00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which now, of course,\n\n658\n00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,190\nmy mouse is no longer, oh there it goes.\n\n659\n00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,480\nSo I would actually be able to\npull a picture up, and then,\n\n660\n00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,760\nat that point, I could actually choose\nwhatever picture I wanted to and\n\n661\n00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,900\ncreate those points, as well.\n\n662\n00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,950\nAgain, in 687, you probably went\nover that a little bit more.\n\n663\n00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,568\nBut again, just as a brief reminder here,\nand nothing hard for us.\n\n664\n00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,705\nBut just remember that you\nactually do need to do that.\n\n665\n00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:21,835\nIt's right there.\n\n666\n00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:22,335\n>> Hm.\n\n667\n00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:25,885\nYeah, you know, I, you can jump\nover to my, my machine real quick.\n\n668\n00:30:27,235 --> 00:30:31,255\nAnd on I'm just yeah you know,\nsure enough just like what Ronnie said,\n\n669\n00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:32,810\nyou get in your charms bar.\n\n670\n00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,840\nAnd settings, change PC settings,\nit's sitting by by my face there, but\n\n671\n00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,140\nchange PC settings, and it opens up,\nand then click into accounts.\n\n672\n00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,650\nAnd so in the, the VME you were\nusing was joined to a domain and\n\n673\n00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,140\nso that it wasn't, wasn't working.\n\n674\n00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:53,680\nBut we're gonna do sign in options where\nthe options here to do a picture password.\n\n675\n00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:01,545\nWe can click add and\nenter in, Enter the password.\n\n676\n00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:04,120\nAnd so\nnow we can just go through the things.\n\n677\n00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,900\nChoose a password.\n\n678\n00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,050\nI don't,, I don't have any,\nany pictures on here.\n\n679\n00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,410\nI don't use picture\npassword on this account.\n\n680\n00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,250\nBut yeah, you choose a,\nyeah, a password and\n\n681\n00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,850\nyou run through the little wizard\ndeal set up those gestures.\n\n682\n00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,630\n>> Yep.\n\n683\n00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,255\n>> But accounts, sign in options,\nand then picture password.\n\n684\n00:31:19,255 --> 00:31:22,940\n>> Yep,and you can see the one for\nthe pin, just like we mentioned as well.\n\n685\n00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,749\nAnd even, directly instead of having to\ngo to the GP yet, I noticed you can even\n\n686\n00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:30,120\nchange your password policy from\nhere as well, so there you go.\n\n687\n00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,632\n>> Hm.\nWell, all right.\n\n688\n00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:37,200\n>> All right, now we are bumping\nup right up on break time.\n\n689\n00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,620\nWe do have a another option to get to,\nget to that after our break.\n\n690\n00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,135\nGood ol' biometrics.\n\n691\n00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:42,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n692\n00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,520\n>> And all right.\n\n693\n00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,182\nWell, sweet.\nWe'll get to that stuff after the break.\n\n694\n00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:53,555\n[MUSIC]\n\n695\n00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:55,386\nAlright, welcome back.\n\n696\n00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:58,767\nAll right, so where we left off,\nwe're just getting into\n\n697\n00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:02,851\ntalking about biometrics and\nhow Windows 8.1 can use biometrics.\n\n698\n00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:03,513\n>> Yeah.\n\n699\n00:32:03,513 --> 00:32:06,960\n>> Now On this laptop here\nI don't have any built in,\n\n700\n00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,434\nintegrated, biometric devices.\n\n701\n00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:10,006\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n702\n00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:14,274\n>> The Lenovo ThinkPads, I know those\nguys have the little fingerprint reader,\n\n703\n00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:17,264\nit's like a little like a little line,\nyou know.\n\n704\n00:32:17,264 --> 00:32:19,460\n>> A strip.\n>> A strip, it's got I don't know,\n\n705\n00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,780\ndifferent color little material on it,\nand you just run your finger along it and\n\n706\n00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,000\nsure enough, you know, the thing\nlights up and your computer turns on.\n\n707\n00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,300\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now to get to a lot of the menus and\n\n708\n00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:35,740\noptions to play with biometrics, Windows\n8.1 will, I guess hide, all of that stuff.\n\n709\n00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,575\nIt will, you know, turn it off if there's.\n\n710\n00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:40,348\n>> Right.\n>> There's nothing there to actually use\n\n711\n00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:40,959\nit, so.\n\n712\n00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,050\n>> Yeah, Windows 8.1 is smart enough\nthat you figure out whether or\n\n713\n00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,730\nnot your device has a biometric\nscanner on it, of some sort.\n\n714\n00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,610\nIf it does, it believes that you\nwant to use one of the stronger\n\n715\n00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,540\nmethods of security, or the idea of\nactually using multi factored security.\n\n716\n00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,070\nSo a lot of times you'll see on your,\n\n717\n00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,210\non your sign on screen here, will give\nyou that ability to actually do that.\n\n718\n00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,870\nOkay?\n\n719\n00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,930\nNow, unlike previous editions of Windows,\nlike Windows 7 here, the biometrics that,\n\n720\n00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,090\nthat we actually have\ntoday in Windows 8.1,\n\n721\n00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,870\nto support it, are actually better\nthan what we had in Windows 7.\n\n722\n00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,505\nSo even though Windows 7 might have\nsupported a limited number of biometric\n\n723\n00:33:18,505 --> 00:33:20,037\ntypes of scanners here, well,\n\n724\n00:33:20,037 --> 00:33:24,070\nWindows 8.1 actually just supports\nmore sophisticated ones as well.\n\n725\n00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,030\nSo this is actually becoming very,\nvery popular in today's world.\n\n726\n00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,330\nBecause once again, biometrics,\neven by itself, is a stronger\n\n727\n00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,820\nauthentication factor than just the idea\nof regular passwords, to a point, right?\n\n728\n00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,480\nDon't get me wrong,\nyou can actually go ahead and\n\n729\n00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,710\nguess a ton of different passwords.\n\n730\n00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,490\nBut again, there are things that you can\nleave behind with biometrics that might\n\n731\n00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,560\nmake it easier.\n\n732\n00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,820\nBut it's still more difficult than\nyou think you know, a lot of times.\n\n733\n00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,620\nSo, the idea, right,\nthat a lot of people do, like,\n\n734\n00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,740\nwe mentioned this in the idea\nof the picture passwords.\n\n735\n00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,840\nWe might not have mentioned it,\n\n736\n00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,140\nbut, the idea that your fingers\nleave behind little oils, right?\n\n737\n00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,910\nIf, again, somebody could take your screen\nand kind of, you know, angle it at light,\n\n738\n00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,890\nthey might be able to see where your\nparticular combinations are and go,\n\n739\n00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,440\nhey I know exactly what,\nwhat Ronnie's actually doing.\n\n740\n00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,320\nBut at, at that bigger point here, again,\n\n741\n00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,280\nif they're actually going that far\nthey're probably going to get in anyways.\n\n742\n00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,845\nBut they still can't steal\nmy eyeball out of my head.\n\n743\n00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:18,721\n>> Hm.\n>> Nor can they cut my finger off,\n\n744\n00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:22,840\nto actually be able to run it across the,\nthe biometric scanner.\n\n745\n00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,970\nAgain, not saying it's not possible,\nbut this is a lot harder than,\n\n746\n00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,150\nthan we think it.\n\n747\n00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,810\nBut Windows 8.1 is actually designed\nto work with the more sophisticated\n\n748\n00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,280\ntypes of biometrics and\nactually does a lot more.\n\n749\n00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,710\nAnd it does also include in,\nlike what we mentioned before here is,\n\n750\n00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,470\nwe don't have to install in third party\nutilities here to make them work.\n\n751\n00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,110\nMost of the actual ones are built\nin to what Windows calls\n\n752\n00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:48,115\nthe Windows Biometric Framework,\nokay to, to make sure that that happens.\n\n753\n00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:49,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n754\n00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,875\nNow there are some group policies.\n\n755\n00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:54,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That we can use to control how\n\n756\n00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,005\nbiometrics, I guess how it's used on.\n\n757\n00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:58,530\n>> Yeah.\n>> On our systems.\n\n758\n00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:06,310\nNow to get to that policy setting,\nwe'll jump back onto good old gpedit.msc.\n\n759\n00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,477\n[SOUND] Slide that over.\n\n760\n00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:11,337\nAll right.\n\n761\n00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:15,717\nAnd we'll drill down into\nComputer Configuration,\n\n762\n00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:20,240\nAdministrative Templates, and into System.\n\n763\n00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,770\nI'm sorry, Windows Components.\n\n764\n00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,835\n>> I think you're right.\n\n765\n00:35:25,835 --> 00:35:28,965\n>> And then the biometrics folder.\n\n766\n00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:32,135\nNow, there's not a whole lot in here,\nright?\n\n767\n00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:32,649\nJust four.\n\n768\n00:35:32,649 --> 00:35:35,100\n>> Yep.\n>> But the one right here, right?\n\n769\n00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,774\nAllow the use of biometrics, right?\n\n770\n00:35:37,774 --> 00:35:42,398\nSo we need to turn on the ability for\nWindows to, to use it.\n\n771\n00:35:42,398 --> 00:35:47,304\nSo we enable this policy and,\nand turn that on, right?\n\n772\n00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:50,935\nAllow users to log on using biometrics,\nright?\n\n773\n00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:55,910\nAnother policy that we can enable,\nand allow that stuff.\n\n774\n00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,180\nAnd then domain users and\nall that other good stuff.\n\n775\n00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,785\nSo not, not a whole lot of stuff in there.\n\n776\n00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:01,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But, so\n\n777\n00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,005\nwe can use these process\nthings to control that.\n\n778\n00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:06,180\n>> Yeah, now remember that,\nthat for us here,\n\n779\n00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,590\nright, pay attention especially on\nthese group policy settings here.\n\n780\n00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,770\nBecause you may find out it may\ntake a couple of them, right?\n\n781\n00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,680\nSo Nate, I'm assuming that, maybe,\nwe might have to actually allow the use of\n\n782\n00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,100\nbiometrics before we can\nauthenticate with it?\n\n783\n00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,400\n>> Probably.\n>> Yeah so,\n\n784\n00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,970\nso remember it's not just one of\nthose settings sometimes if you\n\n785\n00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,010\nactually need to.\n\n786\n00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,380\nIt might be a combination of those\nsettings that you might have to turn on\n\n787\n00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,305\nto make them work effectively for us.\n\n788\n00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:29,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n789\n00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,775\n>> Again another possible troubleshooting,\nthing that you might have to do.\n\n790\n00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:33,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n791\n00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,590\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n792\n00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,280\nNo doubt.\nNo doubt.\n\n793\n00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,285\nNow you know in a business corporate.\n\n794\n00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:38,396\n>> Yep.\n>> Type environment,\n\n795\n00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:42,802\nyou know, these group policy settings, a\nlot of times they're they're managed on a,\n\n796\n00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:43,815\non a domain, right?\n\n797\n00:36:43,815 --> 00:36:45,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, they're centrally managed, and\n\n798\n00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:49,190\nit's gonna be the you know,\nthe, I guess, the sys admin,\n\n799\n00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,280\nreally, that will get in there and,\nand manage these policies and,\n\n800\n00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,790\nand ensure that they're being\npushed out to the correct people.\n\n801\n00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,632\nBut, you know, from, the client side, you\nknow, I mean we, we can use these things,\n\n802\n00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:03,830\nyou know, locally,\nwith the local group policy, but you know,\n\n803\n00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,030\na lot of times we do run into problems\nwith this at, at the company.\n\n804\n00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,980\nIt would be something that\nwould need to be escalated.\n\n805\n00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,330\n>> Right.\n>> Unless, I guess, you know,\n\n806\n00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,440\nunless you had those,\nthose rights delegated.\n\n807\n00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n808\n00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,890\nDo you?\n>> It could be.\n\n809\n00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,820\n>> Yep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n810\n00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,660\n>> Sounds good.\n\n811\n00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,325\n>> All right, so that covers the,\nthe multi-factor authentication.\n\n812\n00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:21,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n813\n00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,970\n>> And next on the list of stuff that we\nhave [COUGH] there at, point b, right?\n\n814\n00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,970\nSo identify and resolve issues\nrelated to HomeGroup, computer and\n\n815\n00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,682\nuser stuff and those things.\n\n816\n00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:36,405\nNow HomeGroups,\nwe're gonna wait and do HomeGroups.\n\n817\n00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:37,320\n>> Yep.\n>> Towards the end.\n\n818\n00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,830\nThe, the lab machines that Ronnie and\n\n819\n00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,956\nI are using are joined to a domain,\nwhich won't work.\n\n820\n00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:43,466\n>> Yeah.\n>> With,\n\n821\n00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:48,310\nwith HomeGroups and just to ensure that we\ncan still use those those machines later.\n\n822\n00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,205\nSo we're gonna save home\ngroups til the end.\n\n823\n00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:50,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n824\n00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,350\n>> And so that way we can unjoin the\nunjoin it from the domain during break or\n\n825\n00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,170\nsomething\n>> Yeah.\n\n826\n00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,490\n>> And play around with, with home groups.\n\n827\n00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:01,380\nSo let's jump we'll just get it\nstarted there in I guess, point two or\n\n828\n00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,555\nII, one, one.\n\n829\n00:38:02,555 --> 00:38:03,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What's that, Ronnie?\n\n830\n00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,870\nTwo?\n\n831\n00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,090\n>> Yes, that's a roman numeral two.\n\n832\n00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,286\n>> All right.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n833\n00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:07,820\n>> All right, yeah roman numerals.\n\n834\n00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,035\nAll right, so computer and\nuser authentication.\n\n835\n00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:11,760\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n836\n00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,020\n>> Now, on a domain, so let's, let's talk\nabout the, the, the, the sign in process.\n\n837\n00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,770\n>> Okay.\n\n838\n00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,520\n>> All right.\nWell,\n\n839\n00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,000\na computer, right, authenticates when,\nwhen, when it turns on.\n\n840\n00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,880\n>> When it first starts up.\n\n841\n00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,760\n>> Yep.\nUh-huh.\n\n842\n00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,940\nAnd a user authenticates when?\n\n843\n00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,725\n>> When they log on.\n\n844\n00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:27,250\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Yep.\n\n845\n00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,470\n>> When they log on.\n\n846\n00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right?\n\n847\n00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:34,090\nSo, the process for us in terms of this,\nright, is that in a regular idea of\n\n848\n00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,280\ncomputers and users, right, especially in\nthe domain setting, both have to actually\n\n849\n00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,720\nbe able to do, to be a part of what\nwe call that sign on process, right?\n\n850\n00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,720\nSo if a computer is already a part of the\ndomain, okay, one of the first things it\n\n851\n00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,160\ndoes when it actually first turns on here,\nit goes ahead and it does\n\n852\n00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,880\nan authentication procedure and then when\nyou as a user log in it does it as well.\n\n853\n00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,170\nOkay, for your user account that we have.\n\n854\n00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,630\nNow, the process of this,\n\n855\n00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,620\nthough, is a little bit more,\nmore, detailed than that, right?\n\n856\n00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,310\nAnd you, as a technician that's\ngonna be supporting these computers,\n\n857\n00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,860\nyou do need to actually understand at\nleast the basics of the processor, right?\n\n858\n00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,570\nSo when you're computer first turns on\nokay, and then wants to actually do\n\n859\n00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:18,310\nthe authentication process here, we wanna\nmake sure that you actually understand\n\n860\n00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,840\nthat the computer has to know\nwhere to go to authenticate, okay?\n\n861\n00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,530\nSo, is it looking first, locally, or,\n\n862\n00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,700\nis it actually going to\npoint to somewhere else?\n\n863\n00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,110\nNow, for us here we're talking about\nthe idea of a domain authentication,\n\n864\n00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:35,520\nthe computer is actually going to go\nahead and contact the DNS server, okay?\n\n865\n00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,310\nNow how the heck does it actually know\nwhere the DNS server actually is.\n\n866\n00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,850\nWell, you and\nI may have configured it, okay?\n\n867\n00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,580\nIf we've statically assigned IP addresses,\nand subnet masks, and\n\n868\n00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,310\nthe DNS server, or DHCP may have\nactually given that to us, okay?.\n\n869\n00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,800\nSo, it actually contacts the DNS server.\n\n870\n00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,810\nThe DNS server is actually who says hey,\nthis is where you go and\n\n871\n00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,520\nauthenticate, up to the active\ndirectory domain control.\n\n872\n00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,123\nOkay?\n\n873\n00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:03,232\nSo one of the key factors of it right,\nis that the DNS service has to, again,\n\n874\n00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:04,851\nactually Actually be there.\n\n875\n00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:06,993\nOkay?\nSo we have them pointed to another DNS\n\n876\n00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:09,720\nserver, let's say a remote location.\n\n877\n00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,630\nIt's gonna take a lot longer for\na device to authenticate.\n\n878\n00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,540\nOkay?\n\n879\n00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,190\nSo normally what we wanna do is we wanna\npoint it to a DNS server that's fairly\n\n880\n00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,650\nclose in that environment,\nor at least in that site,\n\n881\n00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,370\nto make sure that we can actually\ndo the authentication process.\n\n882\n00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:22,990\nOkay?\n\n883\n00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,450\nSo once everything is authenticated\nagainst that domain controller,\n\n884\n00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,365\nwe're probably ready to go.\n\n885\n00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:28,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n886\n00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:28,990\n>> Yup.\n\n887\n00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,781\n>> Yeah.\nNow, that, so that domain controller,\n\n888\n00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:34,335\nright, so it it's going to check,\n\n889\n00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:38,791\nthe group memberships that that\ncomputer and that user is a member of.\n\n890\n00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:43,241\nBased off those group memberships,\nit will issue a security token, right, and\n\n891\n00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:47,120\nthen that security token will then\nbe used to accsource, accsource?\n\n892\n00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Access resources on the network, right.\n\n893\n00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,260\nSo let's say that\nthe computer reaches out and\n\n894\n00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,260\nit can't contact that domain\ncontroller to authenticate.\n\n895\n00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,354\n>> Yeah\n>> Well,\n\n896\n00:40:58,354 --> 00:41:01,720\nWindows it does cache credentials.\n\n897\n00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,147\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it could use,\n\n898\n00:41:03,147 --> 00:41:06,930\nit could use cache credentials\nto go ahead and, and log in.\n\n899\n00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,291\nNow it won't be able to,\nyou know, pull down your policy,\n\n900\n00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:14,260\nyour refresh policy, and\nthat sort of thing without that but\n\n901\n00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,110\nobviously I think it's\nthat that security token.\n\n902\n00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:22,670\nSo as far as you know kind of beginning\nto troubleshoot things, let's say that\n\n903\n00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,895\nyou know while that, while that user's\non cache credentials or what not.\n\n904\n00:41:25,895 --> 00:41:27,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Let's say that their membership\n\n905\n00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,460\nhas changed and so now they\nare allowed print to I don't know the,\n\n906\n00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,770\nthe really cool giant printer out in\nthe hallway, I don't know, something.\n\n907\n00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:40,128\nWell, that user, if you cannot print\nto that computer, or that printer,\n\n908\n00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:43,516\neven though he has been assigned\nthe permission to use it,\n\n909\n00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:46,906\nthen it could be that he's off\nthose cache credentials and\n\n910\n00:41:46,906 --> 00:41:50,890\nhe hasn't gotten that new security\ntoken to reach out to it.\n\n911\n00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,583\nSo just then a little log-on,\nlogoff for GP update and\n\n912\n00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:58,355\nthen get a new security token so\nthat then he, you know,\n\n913\n00:41:58,355 --> 00:42:03,360\ngets his latest policy permissions,\nthen goes out and accesses things.\n\n914\n00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,889\n>> So remember that for us, in terms of\ncache credentials, you haven't heard of\n\n915\n00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:10,258\nthis term before, okay, so cache\ncredentials are when you do log onto that\n\n916\n00:42:10,258 --> 00:42:13,860\ncomputer initially, and it goes through\nthat process that we just described.\n\n917\n00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,434\nBut it also stores the once it\nactually authenticates it stores\n\n918\n00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:22,940\nthat users credentials on that\nlocal individual machine.\n\n919\n00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,930\nWell, you might go why?\n\n920\n00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:29,410\nWell just in case, okay, it can't contact\nthe domain controller again very quickly\n\n921\n00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,980\nit can actually use those credentials to\nat least give you access to that machine\n\n922\n00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,140\nand whatever access those security\ntokens give you at that point.\n\n923\n00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,990\nOkay?\n\n924\n00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,550\nEvery time you log on,\n\n925\n00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,080\nyou may actually see where it does\ntry to use those cache credentials.\n\n926\n00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,750\nBut it normally tries to contact\nthe domain controller instead to,\n\n927\n00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,860\nto get, make sure it's updated and\neverything else.\n\n928\n00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,198\nIf it doesn't, that's when you\nend up with a cache credential.\n\n929\n00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:50,970\nBelieve it or not, a lot of times,\n\n930\n00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:55,040\nyou do want to see cache credentials on\ncertain machines inside of your network.\n\n931\n00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,090\nAnd actually having it on your\nlocal machines is very good too\n\n932\n00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,230\nbecause at least you can gain\naccess into the computer and\n\n933\n00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:04,590\nto use the resources that were\navailable to you at that point.\n\n934\n00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,860\nThat if you actually turn off and you can\nactually turn off cache credentials here.\n\n935\n00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,121\nYou can actually turn that off,\n\n936\n00:43:09,121 --> 00:43:12,380\nif you don't, you aren't able to actually\nconnect to the domain controller.\n\n937\n00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,940\nYou're not gonna be able to get access to\nthe machine, you're only able to use the,\n\n938\n00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,890\noh, I shouldn't say machine but\n\n939\n00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,890\nnetwork you only be able to use one of\nthe local credentials you have on here.\n\n940\n00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,030\n>> All right, so Ronnie.\n\n941\n00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,170\n>> Yes.\n>> Let me ask, let me ask you this.\n\n942\n00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:23,950\n>> Okay.\n\n943\n00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,770\n>> Let's say that you are a user.\n\n944\n00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,330\n>> Okay.\n>> And you have a laptop.\n\n945\n00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:28,890\n>> Okay.\n\n946\n00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,101\n>> And the laptop is not\nconnected to the network.\n\n947\n00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:32,141\nLet's say, no, no, no.\n\n948\n00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:33,181\nIt is connected to the network.\n\n949\n00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:34,590\n>> Okay.\n>> And you go ahead and\n\n950\n00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,258\nyou log in using your your\ndomain credentials and\n\n951\n00:43:37,258 --> 00:43:39,050\nyou do your work on it or something.\n\n952\n00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,250\nAnd let's say you take that laptop home,\nall right?\n\n953\n00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,570\nSo, it's gone.\n\n954\n00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,468\nWell, you come back to work and now you're\nworking on, on your desktop, and you know,\n\n955\n00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:50,330\nyou log into your account and\nyou change your password, right?\n\n956\n00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,989\nSo now you have a new password that\nyou're logging into the domain with.\n\n957\n00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,630\nWell you go home, and you get onto your\nlittle laptop there and you go to,\n\n958\n00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,200\nto log in, right?\n\n959\n00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,060\nAnd you put in your user name and the,\nthe password, and it's not working.\n\n960\n00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,250\nRight?\n\n961\n00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,230\nSo, you know what, what you would do?\n\n962\n00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,189\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I barely followed that\n\n963\n00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:14,980\nwhole thing.\n\n964\n00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,920\n>> Really, okay?\n>> No, but no, I yeah.\n\n965\n00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,600\nIf I couldn't log on,\n\n966\n00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,365\nI would probably try to log on with\nlocal credentials if I had access to it.\n\n967\n00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:22,410\n>> Mm-hm.\nRight.\n\n968\n00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,140\nThe the cached credentials are it.\n\n969\n00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,450\nSo, if you have a, a computer, maybe I\ndidn't explain the scenario very well.\n\n970\n00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,430\nBut if you have a, a computer, right,\nand it does have credentials that are,\n\n971\n00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:33,510\nare cached on it, and\nused to log in, and let's say, on a,\n\n972\n00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,010\nanother machine or what not.\n\n973\n00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,030\nYou know, you change your password or\nwhat have you.\n\n974\n00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:41,270\nWell, that machine that hasn't logged in,\nyou know,\n\n975\n00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,690\nsince, still has those\nold credentials cached.\n\n976\n00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:49,400\nSo, that could be one reason why a user\nis unable to log into their machine.\n\n977\n00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,300\nTry using the previous password.\n\n978\n00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,420\nMaybe those are the cash credentials\nyou can get into that machine or\n\n979\n00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,750\nyou can get it back onto the network.\n\n980\n00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,370\n>> Yeah.\n>> And, and log in that way.\n\n981\n00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,575\n>> Good, good recommendation.\n\n982\n00:44:58,575 --> 00:44:59,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n983\n00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,103\nYup.\nNow you did mention that we can turn off\n\n984\n00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:03,250\nor we can manage.\n\n985\n00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:03,950\n>> Manage, yeah.\n\n986\n00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,890\n>> Those cached credentials and\nonce again.\n\n987\n00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:07,630\n>> Group policy.\n\n988\n00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,090\n>> We can do it through group policy.\n\n989\n00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,930\nYou wanna take a look at it?\n\n990\n00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:12,150\n>> Let's take a look at it.\n\n991\n00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:12,690\nAll right.\n\n992\n00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,770\n>> Do it.\n\n993\n00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:19,711\n>> What let's minimize this stuff here.\n\n994\n00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:23,325\nAnd let's see, all right,

00:47:23,810\nor we would want to,\nI don't know, one or the other?\n\n1043\n00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:24,750\nYes cache or no cache?\n\n1044\n00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,746\n>> Well, yeah.\nYou know, in,\n\n1045\n00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:30,210\nin a high security environment, right, if\nyou don't want the ability for someone to\n\n1046\n00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:34,674\nhave their credentials cached because\nit could be that they end up you know,\n\n1047\n00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:38,952\nwhere that laptop might be exposed where\nsomebody could actually probably type in\n\n1048\n00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:43,450\ntheir old credentials, or using their\ncached credentials to gain access in.\n\n1049\n00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,620\nYou might wanna do that.\n\n1050\n00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,790\nMost of the time, it really is helpful for\nus, especially on servers,\n\n1051\n00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,054\nyou hate to say it.\n\n1052\n00:47:49,054 --> 00:47:53,134\nThat if you can't contact the domain\ncontrol to log in you might still need to\n\n1053\n00:47:53,134 --> 00:47:55,129\ngain access to that, machine.\n\n1054\n00:47:55,129 --> 00:47:59,471\nSo using cache credentials, is probably a\ngood one in terms of something like that.\n\n1055\n00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:02,452\nBut not every machine needs them And\nso, it is,\n\n1056\n00:48:02,452 --> 00:48:06,510\nit can be a security risk if we're not,\ncareful here on this one.\n\n1057\n00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,150\nOkay.\n\n1058\n00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,405\nSo, you know, we've gotta be careful.\n\n1059\n00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:09,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1060\n00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,470\n>> Is what it comes down to, on,\non the idea of cache credentials.\n\n1061\n00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,030\n>> Yep.\n\n1062\n00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,250\nAnd, and you know, and,\nand of course, you know,\n\n1063\n00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,610\nif, if the computer cannot contact that\ndomain controller for one reason or\n\n1064\n00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:22,020\nanother network connectivity you know,\nit, it, it reaches out to dns.\n\n1065\n00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,470\nDns says, hey, contact this machine,\nyou know, for, to authenticate to.\n\n1066\n00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,260\nAnd, you know, somewhere along the line\nif it does get, messed up, you know,\n\n1067\n00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,990\nyou can cash these credentials.\n\n1068\n00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,030\nAnd Ronnie, and, are.\n\n1069\n00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:36,830\nAre they kept for\na certain amount of time?\n\n1070\n00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,180\nI think like 30 days?\n\n1071\n00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,290\nOr something.\n\n1072\n00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:42,990\nIf you get 30 days and, and then,\nyeah, then it's, it's gone.\n\n1073\n00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:43,790\nYou can't use them anymore.\n\n1074\n00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,500\n>> Yep.\n\n1075\n00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,280\n>> Something like that.\n\n1076\n00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'll have to look that up and\n\n1077\n00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,628\nI'll put them up in the show notes.\n\n1078\n00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:49,540\nSo, what?\n\n1079\n00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,180\n>> Hm?\n\n1080\n00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,360\nOh, no.\nI was gonna\n\n1081\n00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,970\nsay yeah as we continue on here we're,\nwe are now moving just,\n\n1082\n00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:58,730\nI don't wanna say beyond the idea of cache\ncredentials, but we do wanna talk about\n\n1083\n00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,990\nthis idea since we can manage\nthings like cache credentials here.\n\n1084\n00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,740\nWe can go ahead and\n\n1085\n00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,060\ntake a look at the account policy since\nwe're already right in the group policy.\n\n1086\n00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,620\nWe were just showing it right there.\n\n1087\n00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,870\nWe can actually go ahead and\nalso limit, and, and\n\n1088\n00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,930\nthis is stuff you might have actually\nlearned from, from other places and\n\n1089\n00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:16,610\nyour own experience here about limiting\nthe type of password that we can use,\n\n1090\n00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:19,420\nthe length, or, or\nmaking sure we set a maximum length.\n\n1091\n00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,510\nand controlling that as well, 'Kay.\n\n1092\n00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,510\nSo let's, let's go ahead and show how\nwe can manage that since we're actually\n\n1093\n00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,079\nalready in the group policy\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1094\n00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,343\nAll right yea,\nBack in good old group policy, so\n\n1095\n00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:35,543\nit's still left up here where\nwe found that stuff there\n\n1096\n00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:39,049\njust above it, right, in the [NOISE]\n>> Account policy.\n\n1097\n00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,020\nKeep it running, all right we do have the,\nour password policies now.\n\n1098\n00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,011\nWe have visited these, these password\npolicies um,you know, we should\n\n1099\n00:49:50,011 --> 00:49:54,515\njust briefly just go through them again,\nbecause they're pretty cool and important.\n\n1100\n00:49:54,515 --> 00:49:55,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1101\n00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,210\n>> All right.\n\n1102\n00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,770\nUp there at the, at the very top right,\n\n1103\n00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:02,930\nenforce password history how may\npasswords that it, it keeps in there.\n\n1104\n00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:03,852\n>> All right.\n>> How many it remembers.\n\n1105\n00:50:03,852 --> 00:50:08,240\nSo it's cycling through\npasswords you know, I guess, is,\n\n1106\n00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,860\nmaybe the best thing is just to\nrun through like a scenario right.\n\n1107\n00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,760\n>> So yeah, you know, for us in terms\nof that first one there, right,\n\n1108\n00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,270\nthe idea of enforcing a password history\nlets us know exactly how many passwords\n\n1109\n00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,280\nI must use before I can\nreuse a password again.\n\n1110\n00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,490\nSo if I go and set it and\nI hear at a minimum of zero that, okay?\n\n1111\n00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,050\nThat actually means I can\nuse as many passwords or\n\n1112\n00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:33,910\nactually never have to change my password,\nreally in terms of the history.\n\n1113\n00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,030\nSo in other words if, even if I expire it,\nso here they actually show the maximum age\n\n1114\n00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:43,040\n42 days, I can just re-type the exact same\npassword again and it treats it brand new.\n\n1115\n00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,640\n'Kay?\n\n1116\n00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,480\nSo not exactly the best thing\nthat we would have here, but\n\n1117\n00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,930\nI think it also has a maximum like 24, you\nknow, is what we have here on this one.\n\n1118\n00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:52,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1119\n00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,460\nYep.\nSo maximum password age, right,\n\n1120\n00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,890\nso every 42 days we'll have\nto change that password.\n\n1121\n00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:02,075\nThe minimum password age is how long\nyou have to keep that password.\n\n1122\n00:51:02,075 --> 00:51:02,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1123\n00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,940\n>> So let's say that yeah so\nthere's, right?\n\n1124\n00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,110\nSo on this one there's, this is,\nthese are our defaults here.\n\n1125\n00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:07,845\nI haven't changed any of it.\n\n1126\n00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:08,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1127\n00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,345\n>> So there's zero days for\nthe password age.\n\n1128\n00:51:10,345 --> 00:51:10,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1129\n00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,450\n>> So let's say, yeah, a user has\na favorite password and you know, so\n\n1130\n00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,120\nthey have to change.\n\n1131\n00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,700\nTheir 42 days are up and\nthey have to change it and\n\n1132\n00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,070\nthere's no password history and so yeah.\n\n1133\n00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,540\nSo they can change it over and\n\n1134\n00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,455\nover and over again until they can get\nback to their, their favorite password.\n\n1135\n00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:28,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well by changing the minimum\n\n1136\n00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,775\npassword age,\nwe could change it to like one day.\n\n1137\n00:51:30,775 --> 00:51:31,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1138\n00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,110\nThat means they would have\nto keep that password for\n\n1139\n00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:37,428\nat least one day before changing anything.\n\n1140\n00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:38,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1141\n00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n1142\n00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:43,415\n>> And then if we you know, enforced\nthe password history, then you would,\n\n1143\n00:51:43,415 --> 00:51:46,370\nhave to cycle some before\nthey could get back to it.\n\n1144\n00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,660\nAnd then with the,\npassword length, which, crazy.\n\n1145\n00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,140\nSo, yeah, no password is even,\neven required.\n\n1146\n00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,760\nI'm changing this.\n\n1147\n00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,190\nSo I guess we don't have to have any,\na password at all right?\n\n1148\n00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:01,082\n>> Well, if you set it to zero, but\ngo ahead and set it to like, ten and\n\n1149\n00:52:01,082 --> 00:52:02,650\nwatch what happens to the top line.\n\n1150\n00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,500\n>> Do you think it's going to change?\n\n1151\n00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,550\nFrom no passwords\n>> You wanna bet?\n\n1152\n00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:08,420\n>> No, No.\nI'm not gonna bet this one.\n\n1153\n00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,300\n>> Oh look at that!\n\n1154\n00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,964\nYep glad I didn't take that bet.\n\n1155\n00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least yeah, ten characters, so\n\n1156\n00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:17,650\nwe can set the length.\n\n1157\n00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:18,788\n>> I was gonna win my soda back.\n\n1158\n00:52:18,788 --> 00:52:22,070\n>> [LAUGH] Man, I'm, man, I'm thirsty.\n\n1159\n00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,240\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so\n\n1160\n00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,530\nwe do have the complexity requirements.\n\n1161\n00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:26,370\n>> Right.\n\n1162\n00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,870\n>> I'm gonna turn this on.\n\n1163\n00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:33,020\nThat you know, we have to require\nuppercase, lowercase numbers,\n\n1164\n00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,910\nspecial characters those characters,\nitems, you know in the, in the password.\n\n1165\n00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,830\nThose are the complexity requirements,\nand this one, yeah, just save them.\n\n1166\n00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,790\nAnd then yeah store passwords using\nreversible encryption, right,\n\n1167\n00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,785\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n1168\n00:52:47,785 --> 00:52:49,380\n>> Right.\n>> If we need to go that,\n\n1169\n00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,896\ndisabled by default.\n\n1170\n00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:54,370\n>> Mm-hm you know and again, these\nare actually where we go to manage this,\n\n1171\n00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:58,280\nright, on a local computer where you\nmight have a shared inside of work group.\n\n1172\n00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,910\nYou want to be sure,\nthe idea of the complexity or\n\n1173\n00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:05,140\nto make sure that they're changing\ntheir password so often, you know.\n\n1174\n00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,010\nYou might want to do that.\n\n1175\n00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,730\nNot re-using the same passwords over and\nover again.\n\n1176\n00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,650\nUse the enforced password history as well.\n\n1177\n00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,230\n'Kay.\n\n1178\n00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,020\nNot, not exactly the most complex setting,\nbut you should know where this is and\n\n1179\n00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,295\nyou should know how, how to actually\nto configure this to best suit,\n\n1180\n00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,238\nyour your business needs.\n\n1181\n00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,355\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1182\n00:53:20,355 --> 00:53:21,287\n>> 'Kay.\n\n1183\n00:53:21,287 --> 00:53:21,850\n>> Yep.\n\n1184\n00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,030\nAll right, so you know we do have a,\n\n1185\n00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:27,990\nanother option here, but you know we\nare getting a little close to break here.\n\n1186\n00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,930\nWe do have more stuff with,\nour user accounts and, and\n\n1187\n00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,216\naccess and those sorts of things.\n\n1188\n00:53:33,216 --> 00:53:34,600\n>> Mm-hm.\nNow we can manage that stuff,\n\n1189\n00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,570\nso let let's go ahead and\ntake our break here.\n\n1190\n00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:38,320\n>> All right, sounds good..\n\n1191\n00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,191\n>> And when we get back ,we'll dive\nmore into more into, more into.\n\n1192\n00:53:42,191 --> 00:53:43,710\n>> We''ll dive deeper.\n\n1193\n00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:52,025\n>> Well dive deeper into more\naccount stuff after the break.\n\n1194\n00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:56,360\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n1195\n00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,712\nWelcome back so where we left off we\nwere talking about password policies and\n\n1196\n00:54:01,712 --> 00:54:06,199\nthose settings there that we can\ncontrol and enforce on our users and\n\n1197\n00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,735\nlock that stuff down.\n\n1198\n00:54:07,735 --> 00:54:09,687\n>> Right.\n>> Now what about the,\n\n1199\n00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:11,660\nthe user account Itself.\n\n1200\n00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,730\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1201\n00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:16,440\n>> Right so let's say a user is,\nI mean, can't, can't sign in.\n\n1202\n00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,980\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1203\n00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,230\n>> So typically we'll get some\nsort of error message and\n\n1204\n00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,390\nhopefully it will narrow it down some.\n\n1205\n00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,100\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1206\n00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,730\n>> But there are some\nsettings on the user account.\n\n1207\n00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,670\nThat, yeah, that we can control.\n\n1208\n00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,746\n>> Right.\n>> Or support.\n\n1209\n00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:28,775\n>> Yep.\n\n1210\n00:54:28,775 --> 00:54:29,465\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1211\n00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:32,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, all those settings, you know,\n\n1212\n00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:36,690\nreal quick, let, let's just take a look\nat our, like, a local user, user account.\n\n1213\n00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,700\n>> Okay.\n>> And just take a look\n\n1214\n00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,080\nat some of those things, alright.\n\n1215\n00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,980\nSo, on the machine here, let's see,\nI'll just use my machine.\n\n1216\n00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:53,340\nAnd we'll get into manage, [SOUND] and\ninto, local users and groups.\n\n1217\n00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:56,480\nAnd users, all right, and\nthere's me, right there.\n\n1218\n00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,180\nAll right, so\nthere's these little checkboxes,\n\n1219\n00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,220\noh yeah,\nlet me let me push that command there.\n\n1220\n00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,190\nAll right.\n\n1221\n00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,680\nAll right user must change\npassword at next logon.\n\n1222\n00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, when that is checked,\n\n1223\n00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:15,680\nnext time the user logs in that user would\nbe prompted to change the, the password.\n\n1224\n00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,270\nA user cannot password, right?\n\n1225\n00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> So we make sure that they\n\n1226\n00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,730\ndon't change it.\n\n1227\n00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:20,780\n>> Right.\n\n1228\n00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,020\n>> Ronnie, can you, can you think of a,\n\n1229\n00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:26,270\nof a situation where you wouldn't want\nsomebody to change their password?\n\n1230\n00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:29,240\n>> If anything, it'd probably be a service\naccount, more than anything else.\n\n1231\n00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,750\n>> Hm.\n>> Right so that way they don't actually\n\n1232\n00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:35,220\nmanage it or change it that, you know,\nthey just don't mess with it.\n\n1233\n00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,542\n>> Right fair enough.\n\n1234\n00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,520\nAll right we have a password\nthat never expires.\n\n1235\n00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,690\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Right so, I,\n\n1236\n00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,725\nI checked on almost all of mine because I.\n\n1237\n00:55:41,725 --> 00:55:42,660\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I don't want to mess\n\n1238\n00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,240\nwith nothing right?\n\n1239\n00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,790\n>> That's right.\n>> If what I put it in,\n\n1240\n00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:45,470\nI don't want to change.\n\n1241\n00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,090\n>> [LAUGH] I don't want to be prompted or\nasked or anything.\n\n1242\n00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,022\n>> So I check that one.\n\n1243\n00:55:49,022 --> 00:55:54,875\nAll right, so now we have account is\ndisabled and account is locked out.\n\n1244\n00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:59,536\nNow account is disabled, right,\nso if, if a user goes on,\n\n1245\n00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:04,610\nlet's say a mandatory vacation,\nor some extended leave.\n\n1246\n00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,030\nOr you know, they're fired,\n\n1247\n00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,750\nwe don't want to delete their account,\nthen we can disable the account.\n\n1248\n00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,360\nSo, it's not gone right, so\nif we deleted the account.\n\n1249\n00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,560\nLet's say the user.\n\n1250\n00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,020\nComes back and we make a new account.\n\n1251\n00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,030\nWell making that a new account,\nthe user will have a new SID, right?\n\n1252\n00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,170\n>> Right.\n>> A security identifier, and so\n\n1253\n00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,650\nthey won't be back in those same groups,\nthey won't have the same permissions.\n\n1254\n00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,010\nWe have to go back and\nassign everything again.\n\n1255\n00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,685\nSo we can just disable the account.\n\n1256\n00:56:30,685 --> 00:56:32,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Just kind of park it.\n\n1257\n00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:32,636\n>> Alright.\n>> And\n\n1258\n00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:36,260\nthen account is locked out\n>> By entering a password in too many\n\n1259\n00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,490\ntimes or something that would enforce\nthat, then their account would then be\n\n1260\n00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:44,950\nlocked out, and that checkbox would be\nhighlighted, and a little check in there.\n\n1261\n00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:48,930\nThen we just go in, you know,\nclick, clear it and apply it, and\n\n1262\n00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,860\nthen it's no longer locked out.\n\n1263\n00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,680\n>> That's true.\n\n1264\n00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,630\n>> All right.\n\n1265\n00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,110\n>> So let let's do this.\n\n1266\n00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,050\nAlright, so, let me zoom back out of here.\n\n1267\n00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:01,080\nLet me jump over to this\nmachine right here, alright.\n\n1268\n00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:07,490\nSo this is a a VM that's on a mythical\ncompany's domain, chickabow.net.\n\n1269\n00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,810\nAnd, let let's go ahead and\nlock Ronnie's user account.\n\n1270\n00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:11,620\n>> Why not?\n\n1271\n00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,150\n>> So we'll not, not a lockout.\n\n1272\n00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,420\nSorry.\nWere, were gonna disable your account.\n\n1273\n00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,690\n>> Disable the account.\n\n1274\n00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,300\n>> Disable the account, and then you know\nso we'll have R-Ronny try to log back in.\n\n1275\n00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,820\nAnd we'll just take look\nat that error message.\n\n1276\n00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,440\n>> Sure, sounds good.\n\n1277\n00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,370\n>> And then based off that error message\nyou will then try to see how we can\n\n1278\n00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,040\n>> Support, Ronnie, how does that sound?\n\n1279\n00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:29,600\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1280\n00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,130\nGood.\n\n1281\n00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,840\n>> Alright, let's do that.\n\n1282\n00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,020\nSo, we will use good old\nPowershell to do this.\n\n1283\n00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,830\n>> Yes.\n\n1284\n00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:44,140\n>> Right, and\nwhat we will do then is set AD user.\n\n1285\n00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,680\n>> Maybe put in a.\n\n1286\n00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,320\nA, AD user or not.\n\n1287\n00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,600\nI'm pushing the tab key, and\nit kind of auto fills it in there.\n\n1288\n00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:59,570\nSo set AD user right, enabled,\nlet me put a little money sign.\n\n1289\n00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:00,560\nRight now.\n\n1290\n00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,290\n>> We'll put in false, right.\n\n1291\n00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:07,400\nSo set ID user, so we're making\na change to an active directory user.\n\n1292\n00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,840\nWhat are we gonna change?\n\n1293\n00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,810\nWell the enabled parameter, and\nwhat about the enabled parameter?\n\n1294\n00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:13,950\n>> We're making it false.\n\n1295\n00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:14,650\n>> False, right.\n\n1296\n00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:19,190\nSo, so no longer,\nno longer enabled, right.\n\n1297\n00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:22,120\nAnd so the, the identity,\n\n1298\n00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,920\nso who we're making this change to,\nIt's going to be running.\n\n1299\n00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:33,260\nNow, with Powershell, if it spits out\na bunch of red text, then it was wrong.\n\n1300\n00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,610\n>> Yep, you entered it wrong.\n\n1301\n00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,670\n>> Something happened.\n\n1302\n00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:39,480\nWell, with no feedback,\nwe assume that it happened right.\n\n1303\n00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,140\nAll right, Ryan, so let's switch over to\nyour machine there, you are currently\n\n1304\n00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,440\nlogged in so I'm able to actually\nstay logged in at this point here.\n\n1305\n00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,860\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sign out.\n\n1306\n00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,890\nand I didn't give my free\nasparagus recipes again.\n\n1307\n00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:58,630\n>> We'll get it next time.\n\n1308\n00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:03,430\n>> I know, and now I'm gonna log back in.\n\n1309\n00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,080\n>> Here.\n\n1310\n00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,740\nEnter my super secret password and\nthere it is.\n\n1311\n00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,570\nOkay, so let me see,\nI think I do have mine turned on as well.\n\n1312\n00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:16,070\nI do.\n\n1313\n00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,880\nOh, look at that all right.\n\n1314\n00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,490\nSo there's the actual\nerror message that I get.\n\n1315\n00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,835\nThe user account is currently disabled.\n\n1316\n00:59:25,835 --> 00:59:27,710\n'Kay?\nWhich is what Nate set here.\n\n1317\n00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,950\nCannot be used for assistance, I need\nto contact my system administrator or,\n\n1318\n00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,710\nor technical support at this point.\n\n1319\n00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,340\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1320\n00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,120\n>> Now.\nAt this point I could actually get m,\n\n1321\n00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,680\nvery many different messages, right?\n\n1322\n00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,670\nIt could be where I call Nate up and he\nsays you need to speak to your supervisor\n\n1323\n00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,920\nand which would probably be a bad day for\nme if, if that happened.\n\n1324\n00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,640\nOr, they could actually check the account\nitself and find out that it was disabled\n\n1325\n00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,560\nand he would still need to go ahead and\nfigure out why it was disabled.\n\n1326\n00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,100\nFrom a supervisor or\nif it was just disabled by, for testing or\n\n1327\n00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,210\nsomething like that.\n\n1328\n00:59:58,210 --> 00:59:59,760\nBut at this point,\nhe could actually go ahead and\n\n1329\n00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,770\ncheck on his machine or\non the domain controller\n\n1330\n01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,940\nto figure out why my account was\nactually disabled at that point.\n\n1331\n01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,700\nIs what could be done.\n\n1332\n01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,080\nSo here it does clearly state that we\nneed to figure out what's going on.\n\n1333\n01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,840\nWe need to ask for assistance.\n\n1334\n01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,630\nAll right.\n\n1335\n01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,970\nSo, that so yeah.\n\n1336\n01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:17,920\nThe for this pretty pretty to the point.\n\n1337\n01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,630\nSo it is, it is disabled.\n\n1338\n01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:22,990\nSo let's enable his account and\ngive Ronnie access.\n\n1339\n01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:27,330\nSo let's say you know, we're like, well,\nyou know, we were going to let Ronnie go,\n\n1340\n01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,820\nbut we don't have anyone to bring us\ncoffee and donuts anymore every morning.\n\n1341\n01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,460\n>> That's right.\n\n1342\n01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,020\n>> So let's go ahead and\n\n1343\n01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,600\nbring him back onto the team and make\nsure that he keeps bringing that stuff.\n\n1344\n01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600\n>> Yeah. That's right. >> So.\n\n1345\n01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,540\n>> Let's jump over then to, this machine\nhere and so now what we will do,\n\n1346\n01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,930\nI'll just put the up arrow just\nto save a little bit of typing.\n\n1347\n01:00:48,262 --> 01:00:50,090\nAll right, so now we run that,\nthat command, right.\n\n1348\n01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:50,980\nSo set AD user.\n\n1349\n01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,450\nWe're making a change to\nactive director user, alright.\n\n1350\n01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,880\nWe would, huh, put in either.\n\n1351\n01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,640\nAll right, so we're gonna be changing\nthe enabled parameter of it,\n\n1352\n01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,750\nand we're now changing it to true.\n\n1353\n01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,810\nSo we want it to be enabled, so\n\n1354\n01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:08,080\nthe identity who we're doing this to or\nwhat, and Ronnie.\n\n1355\n01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n1356\n01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,800\n>> So push it, right,\nno red text, and you know by, and\n\n1357\n01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,370\nby red text I mean like,\n>> So\n\n1358\n01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,750\nwe misspell that, there's that red text.\n\n1359\n01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:18,900\nAll right, so, you know,\n\n1360\n01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,260\nwe didn't get anywhere when we ran\nthat command, so we should be good.\n\n1361\n01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,500\nAll right.\n>> Yep.\n\n1362\n01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,790\nSo for us, the nice thing about this,\nright, in terms of this red text you see\n\n1363\n01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:30,100\nright here, it tells you exactly\nwhat you did type in wrong.\n\n1364\n01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,470\n>> Right there as, as you take a look at.\n\n1365\n01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:33,050\nOkay?\n\n1366\n01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,230\nSo you see where it says\non that first line,\n\n1367\n01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:39,230\n\"A parameter cannot be found that\nmatches the parameter name\".\n\n1368\n01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,900\nSo, hopefully if you can spell.\n\n1369\n01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,540\nYou should actually g.\n\n1370\n01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,220\n>> Ha ha.\n>> Go oh yeah, I misspelled that.\n\n1371\n01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:43,990\nAnd then fix that.\n\n1372\n01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:44,520\n>> Oops.\n>> And,\n\n1373\n01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:48,270\nif it doesn't give you any more red texts,\n>> Then you're okay to go, okay?\n\n1374\n01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:51,570\nSo, for us hopefully that first\ncommand took place, and then,\n\n1375\n01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:55,010\nnow I should be able to log directly in.\n\n1376\n01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,210\nSo, I go to my machine.\n\n1377\n01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,810\nI can now go ahead and click connect.\n\n1378\n01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,810\nAnd now enter in my super\nsecret lab password.\n\n1379\n01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:08,250\nAnd it's asking me for\na certificate if I want to trust it.\n\n1380\n01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,550\n>> And there it is I am back\non the network, right here.\n\n1381\n01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:17,290\n>> Yea, so, you know, one example,\none example you know,\n\n1382\n01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,650\nany kind of problems with the account.\n\n1383\n01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:23,540\nWell I guess this one was more of\nan account problem rather than,\n\n1384\n01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,690\nyou know authentication problem.\n\n1385\n01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:31,370\nBut, nonetheless, the point behind it is\nthat we can use these error messages,\n\n1386\n01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:36,050\nto kind of pinpoint what it is, i guess\nnarrow down the possibilities of what is\n\n1387\n01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,910\nup with the account, see what we can do.\n\n1388\n01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:39,020\n>> Right.\n\n1389\n01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,610\n>> And, almost everything\ncan be done from Powershell.\n\n1390\n01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,320\n>> Yea, just about.\n\n1391\n01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:48,385\n>> All right, so so going on and\ncontinuing on with credentials.\n\n1392\n01:02:48,385 --> 01:02:51,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There is a really neat utility,\n\n1393\n01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:54,080\ntool you know all the proper words to use.\n\n1394\n01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:58,060\nBut this really cool thing\nin Windows 8 that is called.\n\n1395\n01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,590\nthe credential manager.\n\n1396\n01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,980\n>> Credential manager.\n\n1397\n01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,630\n>> That's right.\n\n1398\n01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:05,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> So now with the credential manager and\n\n1399\n01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:09,360\nthat it's it stores the,\nit stores the credentials.\n\n1400\n01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,120\n>> Yeah, that's what it does.\n\n1401\n01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,970\n>> So it can store the credentials for\nwebsites and for resources,\n\n1402\n01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:19,999\nright on the networks of computers and\nother things that you need to log in with.\n\n1403\n01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,930\nWindows can remember that, whenever\nyou go to access that resource again,\n\n1404\n01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,960\nit can stick those credentials\nin there and log on.\n\n1405\n01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,850\nAll right, so, yeah, anything?\n\n1406\n01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:36,790\n>> No, this is the place for us, right,\nif we need it, right, in terms of a user,\n\n1407\n01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:42,030\nnot needing to constantly having to type\nin a password for the website, or do this.\n\n1408\n01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,303\n>> This is actually fairly new kind of\nproductivity feature for us as well.\n\n1409\n01:03:45,303 --> 01:03:45,918\nKay?\n\n1410\n01:03:45,918 --> 01:03:47,840\nWhich gives us the ability to go ahead and\n\n1411\n01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,620\npre-store all those passwords\nin those locations here.\n\n1412\n01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,802\nAnd to have them where they're\nactually easily retrievable.\n\n1413\n01:03:52,802 --> 01:03:54,057\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1414\n01:03:54,057 --> 01:03:57,996\n>> All right so, let's take a look\nat credential manager, [CROSSTALK].\n\n1415\n01:03:57,996 --> 01:03:59,607\nSo on to this machine here,\n\n1416\n01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:03,251\nto get into good old credential manager,\nI'll open this up,\n\n1417\n01:04:03,251 --> 01:04:08,380\nand of course there's just always more\nthan one way to get to the same place.\n\n1418\n01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:12,670\nSo to get to control panel, one of my\nfavorite ways is I click here, and\n\n1419\n01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:16,320\nthen I click on open control panel, and\n\n1420\n01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,280\nthen into user accounts, and\nboo yeah, that's them right there.\n\n1421\n01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,220\nCredential manager.\n\n1422\n01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:27,070\nAlright, so I'll click on credential\nmanager and this little guy opens up here.\n\n1423\n01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,870\nAnd so now we have,\nthere are two different fields,\n\n1424\n01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:35,950\ntwo different spots where we can\nstore these credentials, right?\n\n1425\n01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:38,270\nSo these are,\nI guest they're called vaults.\n\n1426\n01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:39,580\nThese two vaults.\n\n1427\n01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:45,680\nSo we have one for web credentials, and\nthe other one for Windows credentials.\n\n1428\n01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,080\nSo then, you know,\nthere's stuff I have in here so,\n\n1429\n01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,430\nlet's just take a quick\nlook at web credentials.\n\n1430\n01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,350\nAll right.\n\n1431\n01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:56,370\nSo, these web credentials, it saves\nthings that we enter to on the web.\n\n1432\n01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:59,520\nNow, this one right here is saving forums,\n\n1433\n01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,570\nyou know, forums credentials\nsorts of things saving here now.\n\n1434\n01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:08,310\nIf there's some you know, kind of a extra\nnet websites or you know, internet\n\n1435\n01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:13,130\nwebsites, and you kind of company portals\nto log into, then, you know, that would be\n\n1436\n01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:16,345\nprimarily what would be going into these\nvaults so you could remember those things.\n\n1437\n01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:17,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1438\n01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,620\nNow how do you get it into the vaults?\n\n1439\n01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,690\n>> Oh.\n\n1440\n01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:26,450\n>> So, right now, so we've got XDA\ndevelopers and we've got jixer.com, yeah,\n\n1441\n01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:27,595\nthat site, horrible site.\n\n1442\n01:05:27,595 --> 01:05:28,330\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1443\n01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,250\nSo, let, let's go and check it out.\n\n1444\n01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,430\n>> All right.\n\n1445\n01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:35,690\nAll right, so there's one credential that\nthat's not saved in there, all right, and\n\n1446\n01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:39,633\nthat is to arstechnica.\n\n1447\n01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:43,270\nAll right, so arstechnica right, just a,\n\n1448\n01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:48,570\na news blog deal, and\nlet's go ahead and log in to this guy.\n\n1449\n01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:56,140\nSo log in, so enter that in,\nenter in the password.\n\n1450\n01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,520\nI'm gonna go and click logged in.\n\n1451\n01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:00,880\nClick on log in.\n\n1452\n01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,520\nSo sure enough, down there,\nwould you like to store this password for\n\n1453\n01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,739\narstechnica, sure, we'll click on yes.\n\n1454\n01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,420\nAnd that's it.\n\n1455\n01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:11,600\n>> Yep.\n>> All right.\n\n1456\n01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,200\nSo let's go on back here, let's go ahead\nand go back there, and click on this here.\n\n1457\n01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,040\nSure enough, so there we go.\n\n1458\n01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,620\nSo now, so, the so my credentials for\n\n1459\n01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:24,875\nthat webpage is now stored\nin credential manager.\n\n1460\n01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:26,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1461\n01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,700\n>> Now let's say if I\nchange the password or, or\n\n1462\n01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,810\nwhat have you,\n>> we're going to drop this little down\n\n1463\n01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:33,720\narrow and we get a little bit\nmore information about it.\n\n1464\n01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:41,400\nThat's right let me close that down now,\nI can use that tool.\n\n1465\n01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,242\nAnd slowly move my mouse down.\n\n1466\n01:06:44,242 --> 01:06:45,090\nAll right, so we got\n\n1467\n01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:50,090\na little bit of information about this\ncredential that's stored in there.\n\n1468\n01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:54,030\nThe web address, the username, roaming,\nwhether I can take it with me to other\n\n1469\n01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:58,790\nplaces, who save it and explorer save\nit and there's the password, and\n\n1470\n01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:01,450\nthen if I no longer want to keep\nthis credential in there, well,\n\n1471\n01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,280\nwe can just, click on remove and\nwipe that guy out.\n\n1472\n01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,260\n>> There you

right at the house so\n\n1475\n01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:18,450\nI don't have to type anything in and\nthen we've got security cameras right, so\n\n1476\n01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:21,670\nin case I heard a bump in the night,\nI can hurry and\n\n1477\n01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,650\nlog into the security cameras and\nsee what's roaming out there.\n\n1478\n01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:25,900\nApparently it's not.\n\n1479\n01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,020\nRonnie trying to take stuff\nout of my yard like that.\n\n1480\n01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:28,850\n>> That's right.\n\n1481\n01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:30,515\n>>

happen, right, or\n\n1499\n01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,860\njust part of the backup process,\nwe can back these guys up.\n\n1500\n01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:09,000\nClick on it, Backup to, let's

credentials.\n\n1523\n01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,980\nAnd later, we can restore them.\n\n1524\n01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,010\nWe're using the same method there.\n\n1525\n01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:35,120\n>> Yep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1526\n01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,535\nSo there we go, credential manager.\n\n1527\n01:09:36,535 --> 01:09:38,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> How we can save our passwords in there.\n\n1528\n01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:42,270\nOh, yeah, let yeah,\nwe didn't add anything.\n\n1529\n01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:43,320\nLet's add something in there.\n\n1530\n01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,940\n>> All right, so.\n\n1531\n01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,330\n>> Back in good old credential manager.\n\n1532\n01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:52,140\nLet's let's add a, a credential,\nso some

Nathan and then password,\nwinner and a, password, there you go.\n\n1539\n01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:13,565\nSo now when I browse two,\nten dot ten dot five dot 100.\n\n1540\n01:10:13,565 --> 01:10:16,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There are my credentials it will\n\n1541\n01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,045\nprompt, it will slap those guys in there\nand then I don't have to remember much.\n\n1542\n01:10:20,045 --> 01:10:21,581\n>> Yeah.\n>> It was a good thing.\n\n1543\n01:10:21,581 --> 01:10:22,191\n>> It is.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1544\n01:10:22,191 --> 01:10:23,657\n>> It makes it much

old credential manager and\nhow we can use that guy.\n\n1550\n01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,530\nNow let,\nlet's get back into our objectives.\n\n1551\n01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:40,930\nWe'll see where we left off at.\n\n1552\n01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,000\n>> Let's see.\n\n1553\n01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,895\n>> All right, work place join.\n\n1554\n01:10:43,895 --> 01:10:45,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1555\n01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,000\nYeah.\nWork,\n\n1556\n01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,240\nwork, work place join did we want\nto cover work, work place join?\n\n1557\n01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,560\nDid we want to wait on that guy?\n\n1558\n01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,810\n>> We, we can try and wait on that guy,\nbut let's, let's make sure at least\n\n1559\n01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:56,350\nwe cover this part, right,\n>> Um-hm.\n\n1560\n01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:57,870\n>> In terms of explaining what it is, and\n\n1561\n01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:58,740\nthen\n>> We,\n\n1562\n01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,790\nwe'd like to actually be able\nto do a lab on later here,\n\n1563\n01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:03,170\nit's just not worked as\nsuccessfully as we want it to.\n\n1564\n01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,740\nSo, so what we're wanna do is\nactually bring that up now.\n\n1565\n01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:08,560\nThe majority of workplace join in\nterms of lab is really not about the,\n\n1566\n01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,170\nthe Windows 8 side, believe it or\nnot it's all about the server 2012.\n\n1567\n01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:17,000\nSide, and you do get that in more detail\nis what ends up happening for the,\n\n1568\n01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,120\nthe idea of the workplace join.\n\n1569\n01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,490\nNow what the heck does\nworkplace join really about?\n\n1570\n01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:26,440\nThere is today the common\ntrend of you know BYOD.\n\n1571\n01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:30,220\nBring your own device so that you can\nactually use them in the workplace.\n\n1572\n01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:35,440\nSome of the devices will, again, work\nfairly well, join right into the domain.\n\n1573\n01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,340\nBut there's a lot of devices\nthat will not today.\n\n1574\n01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,940\nBut they still need access.\n\n1575\n01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,290\nAgain, the idea of what?\n\n1576\n01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:42,820\nWell, network resources.\n\n1577\n01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:46,940\nWorkplace join gives us the ability\nto have these devices instead of\n\n1578\n01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,758\nactually making them\nhave to do a domain join,\n\n1579\n01:11:49,758 --> 01:11:53,156\nthey can actually end up\nconnecting in something we call\n\n1580\n01:11:53,156 --> 01:11:56,796\nActive Direct Refederation Services\nto be able to access.\n\n1581\n01:11:56,796 --> 01:11:58,036\nResources that are on,\n\n1582\n01:11:58,036 --> 01:12:01,137\nthat are on our network here\nby using that workplace joint.\n\n1583\n01:12:01,137 --> 01:12:03,662\nNow, they're not directly auth,\nauthenticating or,\n\n1584\n01:12:03,662 --> 01:12:07,050\nI don't want to stay authenticating,\njoined to our network here.\n\n1585\n01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:10,570\nBut they are actually part of this\nfederated service here that allows them to\n\n1586\n01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:13,430\nactually be able to use certain resources\non our network [INAUDIBLE] ' Kay.\n\n1587\n01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,870\nSo, we want to make sure that\nwe at least cover that part.\n\n1588\n01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:20,150\nThe majority of the part for\nus, in terms of Windows 8 care,\n\n1589\n01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:22,890\nis really about how do\nwe gain access to it.\n\n1590\n01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:27,670\nWell, again, you would actually access\nwhat's called a claims aware application\n\n1591\n01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:29,620\nthrough a web browser.' Kay?\n\n1592\n01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:30,760\nAnd, through that web browser,\n\n1593\n01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:35,190\nthe, the easiest thing to do, is\nregardless of where you are in this world,\n\n1594\n01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:39,690\nis to make sure that you use your\ndomain credentials to gain access in.\n\n1595\n01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:40,490\n'Kay?\nand,\n\n1596\n01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:45,850\nthat is pretty much the key behind this\nin terms of, most of the time, regardless\n\n1597\n01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:51,260\nif whether you're actually on a, on a,\nlaptop, or on a tablet, or whatever it is.\n\n1598\n01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,610\nYou need to gain access to\nthat type of application.\n\n1599\n01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:54,410\nOkay.\n\n1600\n01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:59,520\nWell, you can't gain access to it using,\nif it provides no authentication at all.\n\n1601\n01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,420\nYou got to gain access using your\nparticular domain credentials,\n\n1602\n01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:03,830\nis what you have to do.\n\n1603\n01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:05,320\nSo for us, that is the key.\n\n1604\n01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:08,549\nOnce you enter those in, you'll see\nthat you'll gain access to those\n\n1605\n01:13:08,549 --> 01:13:11,980\napplications that are designed to\nuse that ideal workplace join.\n\n1606\n01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:12,590\nOkay.\n\n1607\n01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:15,690\nSo we just want you to at least have\nthat part, and then we'll come up and\n\n1608\n01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:20,485\nwe'll probably pick this one up again in,\nin a later future date, is what we'll do.\n\n1609\n01:13:20,485 --> 01:13:21,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1610\n01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,550\n>> Yup.\n\n1611\n01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:25,610\n>> All right.\nSo all right.\n\n1612\n01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,680\nYeah. Yeah. So, good deal.\n\n1613\n01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,210\nWe'll we'll do that.\n\n1614\n01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:31,640\nNow, getting in with the, so, so we,\nwe need to talk about the credentials and\n\n1615\n01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:36,680\nhow credentials are, are cached, and\nhow the, the whole sign in process.\n\n1616\n01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:40,030\nWell, with a with a, a computer, right,\n\n1617\n01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:44,990\nso, a computer, right, a computer has\nits own little computer account and\n\n1618\n01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:48,550\nit has a password as well,\njust like a, just like a user account.\n\n1619\n01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:51,740\nRight.\nAnd it is the, the SAM, the SAM,\n\n1620\n01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:55,350\nthe SAM account name, all right,\nfor, for that, that computer.\n\n1621\n01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,050\nAnd every 30 days, the computer, right,\n\n1622\n01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:03,390\nwill talk to a domain controller,\nand you get his password changed.\n\n1623\n01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:05,820\n>> Right.\n>> Every 30 days, it rotates.\n\n1624\n01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:11,570\nAnd the computer then will have that, that\nrelationship with the domain controller,\n\n1625\n01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:14,080\nand it it's called a secure channel.\n\n1626\n01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,780\nRight, a secure channel.\n\n1627\n01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,960\n>> That's the channel, yeah.\n\n1628\n01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,210\nNow, there are some times that\nsecure channel can break.\n\n1629\n01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:19,850\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1630\n01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:20,520\n>> Right?\n\n1631\n01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,020\n>> Right.\n\n1632\n01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,400\n>> And so, the computer can no\n\n1633\n01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,040\nlonger authenticate itself\nto that domain controller.\n\n1634\n01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now, what kind of things break it?\n\n1635\n01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:30,885\nWell, it it can be many things, right?\n\n1636\n01:14:30,885 --> 01:14:32,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Sometimes computers are,\n\n1637\n01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,870\nare pretty crazy but\nsome of the, the common ones.\n\n1638\n01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,770\n>> Is if the computer is running on\na you know, it's a virtual machine.\n\n1639\n01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:40,550\n>> Yeah.\n>> And this is one that that\n\n1640\n01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:43,328\nI run into a lot here,\nwith all these virtual machines.\n\n1641\n01:14:43,328 --> 01:14:47,120\nAnd we'd make configurations, and\nwe do things to them, and break them, and\n\n1642\n01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,150\nset things up.\n\n1643\n01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,190\nAnd we revert.\n\n1644\n01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:50,170\nRight?\nWe just re\n\n1645\n01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:52,500\nrevert these virtual machines\nto a earlier checkpoint.\n\n1646\n01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n1647\n01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,800\n>> And then the, the checkpoint,\n\n1648\n01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,010\nrolling it back,\n>> It, it breaks it.\n\n1649\n01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:57,660\n>> Alright.\n\n1650\n01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,590\n>> And so there's a command, so we'll show\nyou that command on how you can check to\n\n1651\n01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:04,010\nsee if there is that secure channel,\nif it's there, and if it,\n\n1652\n01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:06,790\nif it's broken, we can repair it.\n\n1653\n01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:10,400\n>> Now, a lot of times you might also end\nup seeing that duplicate names will also\n\n1654\n01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,720\nchange us an active directory domain.\n\n1655\n01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,730\nSo you happen to actually think that\nyou've used a particular password,\n\n1656\n01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:19,460\na particular computer name, but you\ndidn't know, and you typed it in again,\n\n1657\n01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,730\nsometimes this can also do it as well,\n\n1658\n01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:25,090\nwhere now the active directory sees\ntwo names that are exactly the same,\n\n1659\n01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:28,000\ndoesn't know which one to actually trust\nat that point, it can break it as well.\n\n1660\n01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,920\nThe other thing that can also happen\nis let's say that I'm traveling for my\n\n1661\n01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:35,730\ncompany, and I've been disconnected from\nmy network for a, a long period of time.\n\n1662\n01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:37,680\nI bring that computer back online,\nand it says, wait a minute.\n\n1663\n01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,920\nI don't know who you are.\n\n1664\n01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,840\nAnd, a lot of times that is because what?\n\n1665\n01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,810\nWell now, the computer name\naccount may have changed on the,\n\n1666\n01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:47,960\non the domain here but\nnot on my machine yet.\n\n1667\n01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,610\nSo, you just never know\nexactly what can happen.\n\n1668\n01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,870\nThere's a lot of different scenarios here.\n\n1669\n01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:56,110\nIn terms as establishing that channel.\n\n1670\n01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:59,420\nSo lot of times when you see that\nsecure channel breaks and you go and\n\n1671\n01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,170\nyou try to log in and\n\n1672\n01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:05,300\nit tells you it can no longer find a trust\nof some sort that's what you tend to see.\n\n1673\n01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,320\n>> Mhm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1674\n01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,420\n>> Yeah you know reinstalling the opera,\n\n1675\n01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:12,210\nyeah you know ,it exist, if\n>> If you erased all the operating system\n\n1676\n01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:14,520\nand you give the computer\nthe same computer name.\n\n1677\n01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,760\nYou try and join that guy up, right?\n\n1678\n01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,350\nIt's gonna reach out like,\nhey, there's a problem.\n\n1679\n01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:19,890\nI exist.\n\n1680\n01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:20,900\nI'm out there.\n\n1681\n01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,090\nBut you know, it's not me.\n\n1682\n01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:23,640\nRight?\n\n1683\n01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,210\nThe secured channel is broken or\nthe trust relationship something,\n\n1684\n01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,625\nsomething, not there.\n\n1685\n01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:32,020\n[LAUGH] So, if so, yeah.\n\n1686\n01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:32,620\nSo, signing in, now.\n\n1687\n01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,930\nThere is a way that we, that we can\ncheck to see if that secure channel is,\n\n1688\n01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:36,960\nin fact, there.\n\n1689\n01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,480\nIf you know, everything is working, and.\n\n1690\n01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,790\n>> Power Shell command, though.\n\n1691\n01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:41,730\n>> It is a Power Shell command.\n\n1692\n01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,210\n>> There we go.\n>> Good old Power Shell, and.\n\n1693\n01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:43,790\n>> Goodness sakes.\n\n1694\n01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:45,770\nSo you know everything from power shell.\n\n1695\n01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,850\n>> That's right.\n>> All right so, in on the machine here,\n\n1696\n01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,870\nlet's go ahead and fire up power shell, oh\n\n1697\n01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:58,300\nthat's the active directory one it should\nprobably work still, still the same.\n\n1698\n01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,830\nAll right, so, four go to old power shell,\n>> All right, so the command is.\n\n1699\n01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:06,630\nOh yeah, and, and to, to check this out or\nto, I guess, test for\n\n1700\n01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:11,220\nit, there is a er, test for it, repair it,\nchange it, do whatever you want to it.\n\n1701\n01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:13,330\nAnd there is like five\nutilities that do it.\n\n1702\n01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:17,698\nThere's Nltest, there's netdom.\n\n1703\n01:17:17,698 --> 01:17:18,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1704\n01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:19,890\nYeah.\n\n1705\n01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:22,360\n>> Goodness, then you have,\nsome of the others, but\n\n1706\n01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,505\nthe I remember the partial one because I\nthink the command is easy to remember.\n\n1707\n01:17:26,505 --> 01:17:27,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1708\n01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:30,730\n>> It is test dash

right.\n\n1712\n01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,430\nAnd we just hit enter.\n\n1713\n01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:37,345\nWe'll return one of two values.\n\n1714\n01:17:37,345 --> 01:17:38,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1715\n01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:38,620\n>> Right?\n\n1716\n01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,930\nTrue or false.\n\n1717\n01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:40,600\nRight?\n\n1718\n01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,310\nFalse is broken.\n\n1719\n01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,700\nTrue it works.\n\n1720\n01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:44,250\n>> Yep.\n\n1721\n01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:48,010\n>> So let's say that we run it and\nit does return false, right?\n\n1722\n01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:51,340\nWell It is pretty easy, right.\n\n1723\n01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,460\nWe could do repair.\n\n1724\n01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,370\nAll right, so we want to repair it.\n\n1725\n01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,060\nAnd if I run it,\nI wonder if it's gonna do anything.\n\n1726\n01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:05,120\nWell, it accessed denied,\nbut well, you know I,\n\n1727\n01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,390\nbecause it wasn't broken before,\nI wonder if that actually broke it.\n\n1728\n01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:09,170\nMaybe not.\n\n1729\n01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:12,280\nOkay. Whew. And\nI can still use these machines.\n\n1730\n01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,580\nBut the repair command,\nand I'm gonna, let's see.\n\n1731\n01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:20,448\nMystery rights x to, [SOUND] in a solar\ncareer as an active directory power shell\n\n1732\n01:18:20,448 --> 01:18:23,119\ncommandments got something to do with it.\n\n1733\n01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:26,691\nBut anyhow,\nthrowing the repair switch after it,\n\n1734\n01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:31,660\nthat will repair that channel if it\nis indeed broken or reporting false.\n\n1735\n01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:32,160\n>> Yup.\n\n1736\n01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,150\n>> So that that, that's that.\n\n1737\n01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:37,710\nNow, yeah.\nFor secure channel.\n\n1738\n01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,570\nSo, it may, may pop up, may not.\n\n1739\n01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:44,830\nBut if the computer's un, unable to,\nyeah authenticate in itself,\n\n1740\n01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:46,700\npull that group policy down.\n\n1741\n01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,380\nThat yeah, could be that secure channel.\n\n1742\n01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:48,880\n>> Yep.\n\n1743\n01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,500\n>> So, with that

we actually sign on using\n\n1775\n01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,350\na Microsoft account instead.\n\n1776\n01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:20,230\nThat will allow us really, the, the\nbenefit, right, that we have versus local\n\n1777\n01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:24,630\naccount, is the ability to synchronize,\nokay, certain settings that we have.\n\n1778\n01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:28,600\nNow, we have a whole list

have one of the other.\n\n1794\n01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:10,554\nLet's say you, like,\nyou work in a domain environment.\n\n1795\n01:21:10,554 --> 01:21:11,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1796\n01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:14,575\n>> Can you, you know, so\nyou sign in with your domain credentials.\n\n1797\n01:21:14,575 --> 01:21:16,670\nOr what if you need the Microsoft account?\n\n1798\n01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:17,330\nNow what.\n\n1799\n01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:18,370\nWhat do you hook into?\n\n1800\n01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:21,563\n>> Yeah, you can actually try to,\nto again sync those accounts up,\n\n1801\n01:21:21,563 --> 01:21:24,910\nusually in a domain setting, a lot of\ntimes that they're gonna ask you to do,\n\n1802\n01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,350\nof course is not do that.\n\n1803\n01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:29,020\nYou'll log out, log in with your\nMicrosoft account, and connect up and\n\n1804\n01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:32,570\ndo what you need to and\nthen log back in with your domain.\n\n1805\n01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,630\nBut if your domain allows you to, again,\n\n1806\n01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:37,345\nuse the Microsoft account,\nyou can do that as well.\n\n1807\n01:21:37,345 --> 01:21:38,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1808\n01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:42,630\nNow, there is a group policy\nsetting to where you can disable\n\n1809\n01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,930\nthe use of a Microsoft account.\n\n1810\n01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:44,660\n>> Right.\n\n1811\n01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:48,030\n>> And before our, you know, our example\nhere, you know, we're comparing the two.\n\n1812\n01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,420\nWe're not gonna shut that guy off.\n\n1813\n01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,270\n>> No. [LAUGH] >> But but yeah.\n\n1814\n01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:53,780\nSo, you you can use policies to do that.\n\n1815\n01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,980\nAnd lets, lets, see this so,\non this virtual machine here.\n\n1816\n01:21:56,980 --> 01:22:04,107\nSo this is a, a domain yeah,\nthis right here is a domain, PC.\n\n1817\n01:22:04,107 --> 01:22:06,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It does look kind of funny up there.\n\n1818\n01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:10,560\nAnd let's see, I, I want to get into the,\nthe Windows store and\n\n1819\n01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,688\ndownload something right.\n\n1820\n01:22:11,688 --> 01:22:15,706\nSome, some game, definitely

don't have an account.\n\n1854\n01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:26,420\nWhich is what we'll click on, and\nwe'll just create a, a new account.\n\n1855\n01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:26,920\nRight.\n\n1856\n01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:34,750\nSo go and we'll say,\nyou know, Nathan Copeland.\n\n1857\n01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,934\nWell, I don't want to have\nan Outlook address,

Hm.\n\n1875\n01:24:26,177 --> 01:24:27,614\n>> First try.\n\n1876\n01:24:27,614 --> 01:24:28,845\n>> Very good.\n\n1877\n01:24:28,845 --> 01:24:30,217\n>> Mm.\n\n1878\n01:24:30,217 --> 01:24:33,576\nAll right, so at this point,\nright, the little wizard stuff,\n\n1879\n01:24:33,576 --> 01:24:37,620\nI entered in a, a fake number because\nI don't really want it to call, and\n\n1880\n01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:41,913\nwe could try to have it email that address\nbut there's no mail server setup for it so\n\n1881\n01:24:41,913 --> 01:24:45,050\nwe'll say that, you know,\nwe can't do it right now.\n\n1882\n01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,664\n>> There you go.\n>> So it's all right, and\n\n1883\n01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:49,210\nit clicks on through, so there we go.\n\n1884\n01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:51,925\nWe've now connected our domain account.\n\n1885\n01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:53,430\n>> Mm-hm.\nTwo A Microsoft account.\n\n1886\n01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:55,855\nNow, I mean,\nit's not it's not verified, right?\n\n1887\n01:24:55,855 --> 01:24:56,410\n>> Right.\n\n1888\n01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:58,676\n>> So it's gonna send out, you, you know,\n\n1889\n01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:01,520\neither that text message or\nan email or something.\n\n1890\n01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,120\nSo right here it's gonna give an error and\nsay,\n\n1891\n01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,460\nwell we need you to verify that account.\n\n1892\n01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll just go and close on this, and\n\n1893\n01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,160\nyou know, and that's fine.\n\n1894\n01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:15,080\nNow one thing I,\nI should have done before we did that.\n\n1895\n01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,940\nIf we go into our change PC settings.\n\n1896\n01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:21,820\nI go into SkyDrive, and\n\n1897\n01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,460\nbefore I connect it to the Microsoft\naccount, if I clicked on like,\n\n1898\n01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:30,430\nCamera roll or Sync settings, there\nwould be red text up here that says that\n\n1899\n01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:33,140\nI must log in with a Microsoft account\n>> Um-hm\n\n1900\n01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:35,400\n>> Before I can sync those settings.\n\n1901\n01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:35,940\n>> Right.\n>> Well,\n\n1902\n01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:39,160\nnow that I'm partially synced\nup with that Microsoft account,\n\n1903\n01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,185\nit's kind of in the middle, right?\n\n1904\n01:25:41,185 --> 01:25:43,300\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So, it it now changed,\n\n1905\n01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,990\nand so I have to, I still have to verify\n>> That account before I can sink all\n\n1906\n01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:48,490\nthese setting across.\n\n1907\n01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:53,450\nBut now, I can login with my domain\ncredentials and still enjoy all\n\n1908\n01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:56,340\nthe benefits of using a Microsoft account-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1909\n01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:57,332\n>> Sink all my settings.\n\n1910\n01:25:57,332 --> 01:25:58,310\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1911\n01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:59,530\n>> Even though this is possible,\n\n1912\n01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:02,280\nmost of the time you're going to probably\nsee in the workplace they're not going to\n\n1913\n01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:07,472\nwant you to sync up your internal Business\naccount with Microsoft's account.\n\n1914\n01:26:07,472 --> 01:26:11,070\nSo even though it's really possible and\nMicrosoft would love for you to do that,\n\n1915\n01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:14,490\nyou're probably gonna see that security\npolicy generally it would probably say,\n\n1916\n01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:17,020\nyeah, we're not gonna\nallow you to do that.\n\n1917\n01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,020\nEven though it is possible, okay?\n\n1918\n01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:22,410\nSo the main benefit for us again is the\nsynchronization with Microsoft Accounts,\n\n1919\n01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:25,450\nas well as access to the the Windows\nStore, which is probably the biggest\n\n1920\n01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:30,600\nbenefit, that, that you'll end up having,\ni, is where we actually have that.\n\n1921\n01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,340\nOkay?\nSo for us,\n\n1922\n01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:32,410\nwe're gonna have a local account,\n\n1923\n01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:35,210\nreally only allows us to access\nwhat's on that computer.\n\n1924\n01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:37,290\nMicrosoft account, Windows Store.\n\n1925\n01:26:37,290 --> 01:26:41,920\nWe can again merge it or again sync that\nwith our active directory domain account\n\n1926\n01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,454\nas well and\ngain access to a whole lot more.\n\n1927\n01:26:46,454 --> 01:26:46,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yep.\n\n1928\n01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:51,317\n[COUGH] All right so, now of course,\nwith everything right, there's,\n\n1929\n01:26:51,317 --> 01:26:53,690\nwe can use group policy to control it.\n\n1930\n01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,190\nNow let's say that,\nyou know there's certain settings.\n\n1931\n01:26:56,190 --> 01:27:00,920\nThat we do want to allow users to sync\nwith and other settings that we do not.\n\n1932\n01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:01,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1933\n01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:03,550\n>> Or we can use policies to enforce that.\n\n1934\n01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:04,330\n>> Right.\n\n1935\n01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:11,888\nSo let's jump over to this machine here,\nand we'll go into good old gpedit.msc.\n\n1936\n01:27:14,836 --> 01:27:18,727\nAnd in here, computer conf,\n\n1937\n01:27:18,727 --> 01:27:24,364\nlet me drag this up and\npull this down, all right,\n\n1938\n01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:31,077\nin computer configuration,\nadministrative templates,\n\n1939\n01:27:31,077 --> 01:27:36,870\nWindows Components got\nthat guy right there.\n\n1940\n01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,620\nSync your settings.\n\n1941\n01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,810\n>> Yep.\n\n1942\n01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:46,246\n>> Now in here, we can set the policies,\nI need to minimize this and pull this up.\n\n1943\n01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:53,931\nSo under settings like we talked about,\nwe can sync certain items, right?\n\n1944\n01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:54,708\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1945\n01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:56,045\n>> Sync across our devices.\n\n1946\n01:27:56,045 --> 01:27:59,021\nSo, If, if we don't want to\nallow users to be able to sync,\n\n1947\n01:27:59,021

background?\n\n1955\n01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:11,815\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n1956\n01:28:11,815 --> 01:28:14,100\n>> [LAUGH] That would be funny.\n\n1957\n01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:14,770\n>> It would.\n\n1958\n01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:15,972\n>> Yeah, should we try it?\n\n1959\n01:28:15,972 --> 01:28:17,150\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n1960\n01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:19,050\n>> All right, so, yeah, there we go.\n\n1961\n01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,410\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> We can use these settings there to\n\n1962\n01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:21,460\ncontrol that stuff.\n\n1963\n01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:28,005\nNow as far as a, a benefit, right,\nof signing in with a Microsoft account, is\n\n1964\n01:28:28,005 --> 01:28:31,525\nthat Windows 8.1 has this, this feature-\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1965\n01:28:31,525 --> 01:28:35,195\n>> Right, this new feature called\npervasive device encryption.\n\n1966\n01:28:35,195 --> 01:28:39,026\n>> Yeah.\n>> Alright, so we have drive encryption-\n\n1967\n01:28:39,026 --> 01:28:39,537\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1968\n01:28:39,537 --> 01:28:41,410\n>> Which refers to, what?\n\n1969\n01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:42,670\nYour, your hard drive.\n\n1970\n01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:43,570\n>> Right.\n\n1971\n01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:44,540\n>> Bitlocker, okay?\n\n1972\n01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,110\n>> Yep, Bitlocker.\n\n1973\n01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:49,290\n>> Then we have device encryption,\nwhich goes towards the the,\n\n1974\n01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,426\nthe Windows tablets-\n>> Okay.\n\n1975\n01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:52,300\n>> Windows mobile phones.\n\n1976\n01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:52,800\n>> Alright.\n\n1977\n01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,080\n>> So, device encryption,\ndrive encryption.\n\n1978\n01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:59,032\nWell, Windows 8.1 does device encryption\n\n1979\n01:28:59,032 --> 01:29:01,230\nautomatically-\n>> Okay.\n\n1980\n01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,670\n>> When signed in with\na Microsoft account.\n\n1981\n01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:05,820\n>> Alright.\n>> It will encrypt\n\n1982\n01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:07,030\nyour drive-\n>> Nice.\n\n1983\n01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:08,820\n>> Automatically by doing that.\n\n1984\n01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:13,470\nNow, there's a a, a handful of\nparameters that have to happen first.\n\n1985\n01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:15,410\n>> Mm hm.\n>> So some pre-requisites.\n\n1986\n01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,680\nAnd to, to, to check on it-\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1987\n01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,431\n>> Whether or\nnot your device is, you know,\n\n1988\n01:29:19,431 --> 01:29:21,720\ndoes meet all those requirements-\n>> All right.\n\n1989\n01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,520\n>> There is a place where you can go to,\nto check, and\n\n1990\n01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:27,650\non this virtual machine, of course, I\ndon't have that Microsoft account set up.\n\n1991\n01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:33,160\nBut we can go into our settings,\nand change PC settings.\n\n1992\n01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,190\nLet me go back here.\n\n1993\n01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:42,568\nAnd if we go to PC and devices,\nand down in here to PC info.\n\n1994\n01:29:42,568 --> 01:29:49,250\nNow, in here, it should specify,\nand, I say, I say should, because I,\n\n1995\n01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:53,420\nI don't have it on, on here, but it should\nspecify whether or not your device is\n\n1996\n01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:58,830\nindeed encrypted automatically,\nby using that pervasive device encryption.\n\n1997\n01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:03,667\nSo when you're signed in with a Microsoft\naccount it should then have, of course,\n\n1998\n01:30:03,667 --> 01:30:08,070\nthere are some parameters behind the\nscenes that need to be met in order to,\n\n1999\n01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:10,699\nto enforce that, but a,\na huge benefit, right-\n\n2000\n01:30:10,699 --> 01:30:11,343\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n2001\n01:30:11,343 --> 01:30:14,450\n>> To using a Microsoft account\nto lock that stuff down.\n\n2002\n01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,870\n>> Sounds good.\n\n2003\n01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:20,176\n>> Alright, Ronnie, well, anything else\nto that you've got about local account,\n\n2004\n01:30:20,176 --> 01:30:21,402\nMicrosoft account?\n\n2005\n01:30:21,402 --> 01:30:22,990\nYou know sorry to cut you off.\n\n2006\n01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:23,720\n>> No, that's fine.\n\n2007\n01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,451\n>> But you, a lot of this stuff, I mean,\n\n2008\n01:30:25,451 --> 01:30:30,320\nwe did, visit a lot of these things in in\n687, but pulling over to the 688, there's,\n\n2009\n01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,000\nI guess, not really a whole lot of\ndifferent stuff between the two.\n\n2010\n01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,980\n>> Yep.\nNo, the,\n\n2011\n01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:38,440\nthe key again is remembering that you're\nlooking at it now from the standpoint of\n\n2012\n01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:42,720\na technician, that is gonna be\nsupporting the idea of Windows 8.1,\n\n2013\n01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,850\nknowing where to go, knowing the actual\nutilities that are actually available for\n\n2014\n01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:49,140\nyou, to be able to support the user\nin terms of authentication and\n\n2015\n01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,010\nauthorization are gonna be key.\n\n2016\n01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:53,900\nSo for you, that means you actually have\nto know the technology that's available\n\n2017\n01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:56,130\nto you, know how to get access to them,\n\n2018\n01:30:56,130 --> 01:31:00,220\nas well as know the basics of their\nprocess and what they're doing, so\n\n2019\n01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:04,230\nthat you can help the user again get\nthose things corrected if they're faulty.\n\n2020\n01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:06,120\nYep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2021\n01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:06,700\n>> That's it.\n\n2022\n01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,236\n>> All right, well.\n\n2023\n01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:12,864\nI guess that that wraps up the little bit\nof objectives that we had lined up that we\n\n2024\n01:31:12,864 --> 01:31:15,239\nare were out for you to cover today.\n\n2025\n01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:16,644\n>> Right.\n>> All right, well,\n\n2026\n01:31:16,644 --> 01:31:21,110\nif you ever have any questions during\nthe show, you log in to our live page and\n\n2027\n01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:23,520\ndown below the live video there's a chat.\n\n2028\n01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,390\nYou can jump in there,\ndrop us a line in the chat.\n\n2029\n01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:27,880\nWe got a chat monitor up here-\n>> Right.\n\n2030\n01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,870\n>> A big old TV that we look at and\nwe respond to.\n\n2031\n01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:33,590\nIf you ever have any questions\nafter the show, log into the Q and\n\n2032\n01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:35,530\nA section at the top of every

00:00:36,233\nAllright, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:38,122\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of I T PRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:39,940\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,220\nToday with Mr. Nate Copeland.\n\n8\n00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,823\nHow's it going Nate?\n\n9\n00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:43,240\n>> Pretty good, Don, pretty good.\n\n10\n00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,140\n>> I, I was debating right there to try\nand pronounce your name some other way,\n\n11\n00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,100\nbut\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,034\n>> failed to come up with something\n\n13\n00:00:48,034 --> 00:00:48,836\ncreative the last moment.\n\n14\n00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:49,970\n>> Um-hm.\n>> So [LAUGH].\n\n15\n00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,860\n>> That works.\n\n16\n00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,360\nThat's okay.\n\n17\n00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,620\n>> Anyhow, so, so we've got a neat\nepisode ahead of us, today.\n\n18\n00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,190\nWe're going to be taking\na look at some of the,\n\n19\n00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,670\nthe problems that can\nhappen with remote access.\n\n20\n00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,750\nAnd, you know, remote access can\nmean a lot of different things.\n\n21\n00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,790\nSo we're going to talk about some of\nthe different connectivity methods.\n\n22\n00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,154\nMost of which we've, we've really\nalready covered in the 687 show, right.\n\n23\n00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,050\n>> Um-hm.\n\n24\n00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,740\n>> But in those shows we were talking\nabout when everything worked right.\n\n25\n00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,340\nToday we're going to talk\nabout when things work wrong.\n\n26\n00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,443\nRight?\nHow we troubleshoot and\n\n27\n00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:23,440\nsupport those environments when they're\nnot quite working the way that we expect.\n\n28\n00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,050\n>> Yep.\nAllright.\n\n29\n00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,450\nSo, the official objective that we'll\nbe covering today and the 76, 88,\n\n30\n00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:35,660\nset of objectives is gonna be down in 2.2,\nand support remote access.\n\n31\n00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,450\nSo we'll be going over things like\nthe V P N, and the CMAK, wait,\n\n32\n00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,840\nso Don, let's try the CMAK, you you know\ndon't really like those abbreviations,\n\n33\n00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,380\nhow people make words out of them.\n\n34\n00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,360\nIs it C M A K?\n\n35\n00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,953\n>> Oh, no, this one, this was [CROSSTALK],\nyou know, I usually do say C M A K,\n\n36\n00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:52,994\nI don't, I don't usually say CMAK,\nbut this one is not that bad.\n\n37\n00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:53,958\n>> Mm\n>> Some of them are just stupid.\n\n38\n00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,473\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, fair enough.\n\n39\n00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:59,730\nSo then yeah,\nnext we have lined up is R D P, right?\n\n40\n00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,610\nAnd the remote desktop services gateway,\nright?\n\n41\n00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,930\nPretty fancy stuff.\n\n42\n00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,870\nAnd then last, but not least,\nnetwork access protection N A P or NAP.\n\n43\n00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,200\nThat you know, we can use to, I guess,\n\n44\n00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,890\ncontrol access to our network if\na particular client isn't compliant and,\n\n45\n00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,940\nyou know, we set those by\ncertain rules and such, and\n\n46\n00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,730\nwe can force that computer into\na remediation network until that\n\n47\n00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,080\nmachine does become compliant, and then\nwe can bring them back on our network.\n\n48\n00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,100\n>> Yeah, and, and remember this is for the\n70-688 exam, which is a Windows 8 exam.\n\n49\n00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,960\nSo, there's a lot of stuff on the server\nside, when it comes to setting up a V P N,\n\n50\n00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,090\nwhen it comes to setting up Remote\nGateway Services or, or NAP, you know,\n\n51\n00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,120\na ton of server side stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,940\nBut that's not what we're\nworried about here.\n\n53\n00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,500\nWe're looking at things from\nthe client perspective,\n\n54\n00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,370\nwhat happens when things go wrong and,\nand what we need to do to correct that.\n\n55\n00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,720\nSo, We're gonna take a look at,\n\n56\n00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,660\nat the correct way and some of the\ndifferent problems that might happen as\n\n57\n00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,275\nwe go to work with this stuff and, and\nultimatly fix a troubled connection.\n\n58\n00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,225\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, so Nate let's go ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:00,744\nget started with we'll,\nwe'll talk about V P N, right?\n\n60\n00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:02,260\n>> Mm-hm, all right.\n\n61\n00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,999\nYeah, you know so, we, we do have a, a lab\nset up for, for V P N and Don's, what I,\n\n62\n00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,510\nwhat, what kind of background?\n\n63\n00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,448\nCause this, I mean this is a, you know,\nwe do cover V P Ns and stuf,f and 687, but\n\n64\n00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:15,719\nfor, you know, on this bit it's, you know,\nI guess figuring out, you know, when,\n\n65\n00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,310\nwhen things aren't, aren't functioning.\n\n66\n00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,910\nSo, you, you think a little bit\nof a back story or anything on.\n\n67\n00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,730\n>> Just, just a bit.\n\n68\n00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,680\nI, you know how, how are people\nnormally gonna use a V P N, right?\n\n69\n00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,900\nSo if you are traveling,\nyou're outside of the office, and\n\n70\n00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,580\nyou need access to an internal resource,\nhow do you get that access?\n\n71\n00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,895\nIn the old days you could dial up, right?\n\n72\n00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:38,044\nYou'd dial in to, to your office network,\nbut it's gonna be slow and, and,\n\n73\n00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:40,529\nactually a lot of computers don't\neven have modems anymore so\n\n74\n00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,468\nit's going to be kind of\ndifficult to support.\n\n75\n00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:46,440\nSo instead we can use V P Ns,\nvirtual private networks.\n\n76\n00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,180\nRegardless of what you're connected to,\nyour D S L, cable,\n\n77\n00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,050\nT 1s, whatever, as long as you have\nan internet connection, you can hopefully\n\n78\n00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,160\nbuild a V P N connection back to your\nhome office, connect to that server, and\n\n79\n00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,210\nthen through that V P N server,\naccess all of your internal resources.\n\n80\n00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,370\nBut there's a lot of components involved.\n\n81\n00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,080\nA lot of places where things can go wrong.\n\n82\n00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,805\nSo what we're gonna to do is we're\ngonna to show you a V P N and, and\n\n83\n00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,787\nNate correct me if I'm\nwrong on any of this, but\n\n84\n00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,780\nwe've got a,a client that's gonna be\nbasically sitting out on the internet.\n\n85\n00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,170\nAnd it's going to V P N into a server,\n\n86\n00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,710\nwhich will then provide it access to\nthe private internal network, all right.\n\n87\n00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,500\nNow once that's up, I'll show you guys the\nsteps we kind of go through as we trouble\n\n88\n00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,350\nshoot to figure out where a problem\nmight be occurring if we're not\n\n89\n00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,250\ngetting through to a resource cuz there's,\nyou know, there's a ton of stuff involved.\n\n90\n00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,305\nThere's all the routers on the internet,\nthere's the V P N server,\n\n91\n00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:41,380\nthere's the internal source,\nyou know, there, there, or host.\n\n92\n00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,180\nThere's all sorts of stuff that can\nget involved in that communication.\n\n93\n00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,409\nSo it can be difficult to\ntroubleshoot sometimes.\n\n94\n00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,698\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n95\n00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:48,933\nNow on the client side,\non the client side, right.\n\n96\n00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:53,080\nSo there's, two different ways that\nwe can connect with this V P N.\n\n97\n00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,520\nThere's this little tool, right,\n\n98\n00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,548\ncalled the the connection\nmanager administration kit.\n\n99\n00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,580\nAnd that that kit it's,\nmade by an administrator, right,\n\n100\n00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,650\nand, and can push it out to the different\nclient machines or stay in and,\n\n101\n00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,030\nand use this to connect the V P N,\nor you can do it a manual way and\n\n102\n00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,880\nenter in the IP address and\nyour credentials and connect that way.\n\n103\n00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,720\nSo two different ways to get\nto the same the same thing.\n\n104\n00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,936\n>> Yeah and, and that C M A K,really,\nI remember when Microsoft released it, it,\n\n105\n00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:26,220\nit's been out for, I don't know,\n15 years and it, it really changed things.\n\n106\n00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,100\nBecause in the old days if you had to\nhave someone manually put in those\n\n107\n00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,930\nsettings, right?\n\n108\n00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,240\nSo you're talking to Bob\nin accounting and, and\n\n109\n00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,340\nhe's out in, in Vegas at a conference and\nhe's, he's half drunk, you know, and\n\n110\n00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,000\nhe's like I gotta get V P N'ed in and\nyou're trying to tell him,\n\n111\n00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,590\nokay, I need you to click on on\nL 2 T P and he's like, L what?\n\n112\n00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,643\nYou know, it, it just it goes downhill,\nit's difficult and there's so\n\n113\n00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:49,960\nmany rules for error and things like that.\n\n114\n00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,145\nWith the C M A K, as an administrator,\nI sit down and I run through a wizard,\n\n115\n00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,620\nand I pick all my options.\n\n116\n00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,260\nAlright, L 2 T P.\n\n117\n00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,540\nHere's the server's IP address.\n\n118\n00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,920\nHere's the credentials we expect.\n\n119\n00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,080\nAll these different things.\n\n120\n00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,910\nYou fill all it out in the C M A K, and\nit generates, a single installable file.\n\n121\n00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,074\nAnd then you just that\nsend that to the person.\n\n122\n00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:09,654\nYou say, okay Bob,\nI'm sending you this file.\n\n123\n00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:11,402\nDouble click on it, right?\n\n124\n00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:13,074\nMuch easier.\n\n125\n00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:13,694\nThey double click on it.\n\n126\n00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:17,297\nIt sets up the V P N connection and\nall that information is fine and\n\n127\n00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:21,430\nthen all they have to do is when they\nrun it just type in their password.\n\n128\n00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,430\nThat's all they have to do.\n\n129\n00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,790\nType in their password and\n\n130\n00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,130\nit will V P N it and you know the settings\nare right cause you did it yourself.\n\n131\n00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,750\nIf they have to manually enter it in,\nthey can get the server name or\n\n132\n00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,910\nservice IP wrong.\n\n133\n00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,145\nThey can pick the wrong authentication\ncredentials, authentication protocols,\n\n134\n00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,650\nencryption protocols, digital signatures.\n\n135\n00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,563\nAll the different settings involved with\nthe V P N connection they could get wrong.\n\n136\n00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:45,057\nAnd it, it's just a,\nit's a lot of room for error, right?\n\n137\n00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:46,499\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right, so, Don, so\n\n138\n00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:48,330\nI'm gonna throw this out, out there.\n\n139\n00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,020\nReady?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n140\n00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,010\n>> So, you know, be,\nbefore the show, right, so\n\n141\n00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,310\neverything was all configured and,\nand everything.\n\n142\n00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,670\nAnd, you know, earlier this\nmorning we had, I had to make a,\n\n143\n00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,140\na change to the whole admin,\nyou know, so a lot of things changed.\n\n144\n00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,040\nAnd just before the show,\n\n145\n00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,130\nright, so Don helped me and, and\neverything is, is working well.\n\n146\n00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,980\nNow there is one setting,\n\n147\n00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,340\none setting I think that we might\nrun into an authentication error.\n\n148\n00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,610\n>> Okay.\n>> There's some kind of,\n\n149\n00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,840\nof problem where it's not connecting.\n\n150\n00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,190\nAnd so we'll we'll go and\nset things up with that.\n\n151\n00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,540\n>> Okay.\n>> And then yeah, and\n\n152\n00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,720\nthen perhaps you can talk us through it\nand we'll see if yeah, if you can find.\n\n153\n00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,795\n>> See if I can figure out the problem?\n\n154\n00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:25,400\n>> Mm-hm, yup.\nCause I'd, I know the problem is.\n\n155\n00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,530\nIf, if we run into that error.\n\n156\n00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If we run into that error\n\n157\n00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,460\nthen then yeah.\n\n158\n00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,580\n>> You shouldn't have said anything.\n\n159\n00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,367\nAnd then you could have been all\nimpressive on the air, like,\n\n160\n00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,192\noh I can fix this.\n\n161\n00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:35,020\nAnd then, then I would have said,\nwow, Nate, you found it.\n\n162\n00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,780\nThat's amazing.\n\n163\n00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,570\n>> Nah, man I wouldn't have\nbeen able to pull it off.\n\n164\n00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,810\nI'd be giggling and, and\nsmiling and skipping.\n\n165\n00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,480\nAnyways.\n\n166\n00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,790\n>> Anyway.\n>> Yeah, straight face.\n\n167\n00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,100\n>> All right so, so let's take a look at\na V P N and let's take a look at what,\n\n168\n00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,990\nwhat I assume is a functional V P N and\nwe'll kind of sort things out from there.\n\n169\n00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,933\nSo do you want to demonstrate, Nate?\n\n170\n00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:54,601\n>> Yeah, should we start off with\nthe good old, with the CMAK?\n\n171\n00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:55,659\n>> We can, do you have it installed?\n\n172\n00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,520\n>> Is that good?\nWhat's that?\n\n173\n00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,600\n>> Do you have it installed?\n\n174\n00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,659\n>> Yeah.\n>> Awesome, yeah,\n\n175\n00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:01,780\nwhy don't you queue it up and, and\nwhile he's bringing it up here real quick,\n\n176\n00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,837\nlet me just mention the C M A K,\nthe connection manager administration kit.\n\n177\n00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:07,021\nYou can download it right\nfrom Microsoft's website.\n\n178\n00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:10,180\nIt's not like a for-charge product or\nanything.\n\n179\n00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,680\nIt used to be included on the Windows DVD.\n\n180\n00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,669\nDo you know is it still on there?\n\n181\n00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:14,319\n>> I don't think it is.\n\n182\n00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,888\n>> I'm not sure.\n\n183\n00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:20,540\nYou know on Windows Server 2012 R2,\nit's a feature.\n\n184\n00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,317\n>> Oh, okay so\nit's just right there in the OS.\n\n185\n00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:25,115\n>> Yeah, so I just turned it on and\nthen it was there.\n\n186\n00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:25,814\n>> Well there we go.\n\n187\n00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:27,520\nAll right, yeah, I think, but yeah,\n\n188\n00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,450\nI think for like Windows 8.1\nyou might have to download it.\n\n189\n00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,480\n>> If you're gonna run it on a client,\nyou have to download it.\n\n190\n00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,460\nYep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n191\n00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,990\nAll right.\nSo, on this machine here, right?\n\n192\n00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,370\nSo this is a domain controller that we\nhave that has that CMAK feature installed.\n\n193\n00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,650\nWe'll just click on Tools and\n\n194\n00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,230\nwe'll just go down to the good old\nConnection Manager Administration kit.\n\n195\n00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,820\nAnd we'll click on Next through there.\n\n196\n00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,660\nAnd on this screen we'll, yeah, should\nwe go through all the little different\n\n197\n00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,600\nmenus and, and\nhow to set this, this guy up?\n\n198\n00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,313\n>> Let's not spend a ton of time on it.\n\n199\n00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:58,856\nThe main thing we need to know and we\ncan go ahead and run through the wizard.\n\n200\n00:08:58,856 --> 00:08:59,494\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n201\n00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:02,058\n>> The main thing we need to\nknow is this is a chance for\n\n202\n00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:06,027\nus as administrators to put in the VPN\nsettings ahead of time, to put them in so\n\n203\n00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:07,574\nthe end users don't have to.\n\n204\n00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:08,475\nSo what's it gonna do?\n\n205\n00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:10,915\nIt's gonna make us pick\nall those settings, and so\n\n206\n00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:13,867\nthat's what we're seeing here\nas Nate goes through and, and\n\n207\n00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,760\nstarts to define what it is that he wants,\nall right?\n\n208\n00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,510\nSo right here, he's creating what's\ncalled a service name, right?\n\n209\n00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,560\nIn the old days, we used to see this from,\nwhat was that company?\n\n210\n00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,510\nProdigy.\n\n211\n00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,350\nProdigy would make these CDs that\nyou'd pop in your computer, and\n\n212\n00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,490\nit would set your computer\nup to be able to dial in.\n\n213\n00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,590\nAll they were doing was using the CMAK to\ncreate a brand of installer and that's\n\n214\n00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,730\nkind of what you're doing here, creating\na branded installer for your company.\n\n215\n00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,860\nSo he just put in his company name.\n\n216\n00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,900\nAnd now, he's picking from.\n\n217\n00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,560\nDid you do existing profiles,\nor all new one?\n\n218\n00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,000\n>> Well this is an all new one.\n\n219\n00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,555\n>> All new one, okay.\n\n220\n00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:47,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you picked to create a new profile,\n\n221\n00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,490\nwhere you have basically a phonebook.\n\n222\n00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,700\nAnd the phonebook is the list of\nservers that you can VPN into.\n\n223\n00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,760\nAnd a lot of organizations just have one,\nbut you might have more than one for\n\n224\n00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,830\nredundancy or more than one location.\n\n225\n00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,075\nAnd so you can add them all in right here.\n\n226\n00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:03,983\nAgain insuring that the end\nusers don't have to type it in,\n\n227\n00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,619\nwhich makes less room for error.\n\n228\n00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:06,803\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n229\n00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,420\nAll right then, yep.\n\n230\n00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,280\nNow on this phonebook stuff, right?\n\n231\n00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,420\nSo, we just kinda click\nNext through most of them.\n\n232\n00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,640\nAlthough on this menu here,\n\n233\n00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,920\nif I don't fill anything out\nin here it does bark at us.\n\n234\n00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,140\nSo it does want some\nkind of phonebook name.\n\n235\n00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,380\n>> Even if it's gonna be empty,\nit's gotta have a name.\n\n236\n00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,754\n>> So we'll just call this one, Courtbook.\n\n237\n00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,910\nAll right.\n\n238\n00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,510\nAnd then we have to give\nit some web address.\n\n239\n00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,210\nAnd then, so, we're working with the\nfictitious network chickabow.net and so\n\n240\n00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,640\nI will just put that, so\nI'll just put that in here.\n\n241\n00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,530\n>> Yeah.\nThe idea here is that once the software is\n\n242\n00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,680\ninstalled, what if you\nwanna update the phonebook?\n\n243\n00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,940\nWhat if you wanna add new\nservers to it down the road?\n\n244\n00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,410\nIf it has a web check in, it can check in\nand update those things automatically.\n\n245\n00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,030\nIf you just put in something fake like\nNate did, and we have an update later on,\n\n246\n00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,863\nwe'll have to send a new installer out\nto the machines to get it up to date.\n\n247\n00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:05,600\n>> Mm-hm, all right, so now we're here to\nthese, the networking properties here.\n\n248\n00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,820\nSo we can just click over and\n\n249\n00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,240\nconfigure how it's gonna get\nthe information that it needs.\n\n250\n00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,220\nAnd, yeah goodness,\nthink we'll just accept the defaults.\n\n251\n00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,370\nMost of the stuff won't really\nbe doing anything with IPv6.\n\n252\n00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,560\nAnd on the security here check v2.\n\n253\n00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,880\nOf course I guess depending on what kind\nof policies are in place or what is set\n\n254\n00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,540\nup on the server end, and we would match\nthose settings here on this client end.\n\n255\n00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,750\n>> And that, that's the important part,\nbecause you can use the CMAK to create\n\n256\n00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,120\nconnections to non-WIndows VPN terminator,\nor concentrators if you want.\n\n257\n00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,790\nSo, in those settings,\nthey had the option to choose like your\n\n258\n00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,330\nencryption protocol and\nyou can choose the different ones.\n\n259\n00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,160\nDrop that box down at the top Nate,\nwhat choices do we get there?\n\n260\n00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,380\nIf we're requiring encryption,\nmaximum whatever and\n\n261\n00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,700\nthen as you pick your authentication types\ndown at the bottom you can go in and\n\n262\n00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,080\npull up the properties there.\n\n263\n00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,270\nSo like if you wanted to use EAP\nthat's where you'd be able to specify\n\n264\n00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,884\nthe different types of certificate\nauthentication and additional information.\n\n265\n00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:07,320\nThis is all stuff that kind of just\nrelates to that VPN connection.\n\n266\n00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,470\nYou know, what it is that\nthe your VPN server requires.\n\n267\n00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,015\nNow, if you make a mistake here,\nthat mistake is\n\n268\n00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:16,860\ngonna get passed on to your end users and\nthey're gonna fail to connect.\n\n269\n00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,740\nSo, we generally make a package and\nthen test it, see if it works.\n\n270\n00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,925\nAnd if it does,\nnow it's ready to go out to the end users.\n\n271\n00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n272\n00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,450\n>> All right and routing table's here so\n\n273\n00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,650\nwe won't be putting in any custom\nroutes or any of that sort.\n\n274\n00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,820\nNo proxy settings.\n\n275\n00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,730\n>> And the, the default on this if\nyou accept that is that all traffic,\n\n276\n00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,255\nwhen somebody VPNs in,\n\n277\n00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:42,610\n100% of their traffic will go through\nthe VPN to your business, all right?\n\n278\n00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,020\nYou may not want that.\n\n279\n00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,700\nSome companies say,\nall right, when you VPN in,\n\n280\n00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,200\nif you're trying to reach an internal IP,\nsend that across the VPN tunnel.\n\n281\n00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,500\nBut if you're trying to reach an external\nIP, just go out to the internet directly.\n\n282\n00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,490\nDon't bother with a VPN.\n\n283\n00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,360\nAll right.\n\n284\n00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,810\nThat is called split tunneling,\nand it's not the default.\n\n285\n00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,752\nIf you choose the default, 100% of\nthe traffic goes over the VPN tunnel.\n\n286\n00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:04,134\nSo, that,\nthat's the way Nate has it right now.\n\n287\n00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:06,210\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right then I went ahead and\n\n288\n00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,230\nclicked Next through some of those\ndefault selections with icons and\n\n289\n00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,750\nthose sorts of things so\nwe won't pick anything for there.\n\n290\n00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:18,577\nAnd a custom help file we'll just\naccept the default help file here and\n\n291\n00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:21,450\nsupport information let's see.\n\n292\n00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,663\n>> This is displayed during\nthe installation so the end users know,\n\n293\n00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:27,820\nhey if I have a problem getting it\ninstalled, who do I call, right?\n\n294\n00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,270\nThis whole thing is creating\na branded application.\n\n295\n00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,810\nYou can do it with your company logo and\nall that.\n\n296\n00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,670\nSo they don't think, oh,\nI need to call Microsoft.\n\n297\n00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,990\nThey get, oh, I need to call\nthe corporate help desk and talk to them.\n\n298\n00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,810\nSo, it's all branded in and consistent.\n\n299\n00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,445\nThat's kind of the cool\npart about the CMAK.\n\n300\n00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n301\n00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,406\nAll right.\nSo here we go.\n\n302\n00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll put in some information and\n\n303\n00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,170\nclick on Next here.\n\n304\n00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,070\nAnd then any custom license agreement,\nwhich you know for\n\n305\n00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,270\nour purposes here we\nwon't toss any in there.\n\n306\n00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,850\nAnd any additional files that you\nmay want to package with this one.\n\n307\n00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,730\nAnd Don, so what, I mean, what kind of\nadditional files would you package along?\n\n308\n00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,750\nI mean, this administration kit, and what?\n\n309\n00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,110\n>> If you were doing like SSL VPN, or\nSSTP, you might want to push a root cert,\n\n310\n00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,940\nto have that installed on\nthe machine as part of this process.\n\n311\n00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,260\nThere may be other things,\nscript files, or just license IDs,\n\n312\n00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,240\nthings like that that you might\nwant to copy down to the machine.\n\n313\n00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,135\nYou can do that but\nyou don't necessarily need to.\n\n314\n00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,040\n>> Mm-hm, nice.\n\n315\n00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,362\nRight, thank you Donald.\n\n316\n00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,555\nAll right so just click on Next through\nhere, and there we go, all right.\n\n317\n00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:29,910\nClick on Next and\nit''ll build that little profile and\n\n318\n00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,690\nthen it sticks it right here in this path,\nProgramFiles/CMAK Profiles, yada yada.\n\n319\n00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,440\nSo I'll drag that out of the way,\nand so now we're gonna go in and\n\n320\n00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,580\nwe'll grab that this little\nexecutable that it built and\n\n321\n00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,910\nwe'll stick it in the network share and\nwe'll pull it over on to our client.\n\n322\n00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,530\nAnd before we yank them\noff of that network.\n\n323\n00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,140\nAll right, so we'll browse in there.\n\n324\n00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,798\nProgram files, CMAK,\nprofiles, Windows Vista.\n\n325\n00:14:57,798 --> 00:15:00,104\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And above, and Courtnet,\n\n326\n00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:01,350\nthat's what we made.\n\n327\n00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,130\nAnd in here,\nthese are just configuration files and\n\n328\n00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,020\nthings that were used to build this up.\n\n329\n00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,300\nIf we wanted to modify this later or\n\n330\n00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,060\nuse this as a template for another\nconnection profile, employees' files.\n\n331\n00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,629\nBut that guy right there\nis all we really need.\n\n332\n00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,263\nSo I'll copy him out.\n\n333\n00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:26,620\nAll right we'll stick him in there.\n\n334\n00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,950\nAll right so now yeah, so\n\n335\n00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,760\nwe should be gone-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n336\n00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,990\n>> So\nwe should be good with all that stuff.\n\n337\n00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,295\nSo, minimize that guy.\n\n338\n00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:34,467\nLet's jump over to our client.\n\n339\n00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,475\nAll right, so that is our little package.\n\n340\n00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:51,406\nAnd this is what would be distributed\nout to our clients or users what not.\n\n341\n00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:54,420\nSo Don, should we run this puppy now or\n\n342\n00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,320\nshould we yank them from the network and\nthen install it?\n\n343\n00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,990\n>> Let's we can pull it from the network.\n\n344\n00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,785\nYeah that'd make sense.\n\n345\n00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:00,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know it would be more like\n\n346\n00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,326\na client that's remote.\n\n347\n00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:05,508\nMaybe we mailed them a CD that had\nthe client on there or whatever it is.\n\n348\n00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:08,722\nYou know a lot of times when you're\nsetting up the company machine you,\n\n349\n00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:11,882\nyou set these things up at that time but\nYou know, one thing I, I,\n\n350\n00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:15,254\nI do here from time to time is, when\npeople say well, if you make this file,\n\n351\n00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:18,880\nand you send it out there and\nsomebody copies it, can't anybody VPN in?\n\n352\n00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,510\nWell, yes and no, right.\n\n353\n00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,860\nYes, anybody can try and VPN in, right?\n\n354\n00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,310\nThey have the settings to connect, but\nno, they won't be able to build a tunnel,\n\n355\n00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,700\nbecause you also need a username and\npassword.\n\n356\n00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,670\nThis contained everything except\nthe username and password to connect.\n\n357\n00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,810\nSo when somebody fires up this VPN\nconnection, they're gonna be prompted for\n\n358\n00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,390\ntheir Windows username and password.\n\n359\n00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,090\nSo, if this file were to get out,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n360\n00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,890\nSomebody would be able to know\nwhat your VPN settings were, but\n\n361\n00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,022\nthey wouldn't be able to establish\na connection without those credentials.\n\n362\n00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:50,304\n>> Mm-hm, sweet.\n\n363\n00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:52,590\nAll right, so\non this file right here right, so\n\n364\n00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,110\nwe'll just go ahead and click on it.\n\n365\n00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,160\nDo you wish to install corp net?\n\n366\n00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,550\nYeah, sure.\n\n367\n00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,500\nGo install it.\n\n368\n00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,248\nAnd we can do for\nall users or just my use.\n\n369\n00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:06,360\nWe'll just do for my use, and include a\nshortcut on the desktop, and there we go.\n\n370\n00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,442\nSo now we get this neat little\ngraphic guy right here popping up.\n\n371\n00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:13,050\nAll right Don, so\nwhat should we connect to it then?\n\n372\n00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,180\n>> Absolutely.\nLet's see if you got your settings right,\n\n373\n00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,860\nalthough, you know, we didn't really\nchange anything from the default,\n\n374\n00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,670\nso it should be pretty cut and dry.\n\n375\n00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,610\nBut you're just going to punch\nin your username and password.\n\n376\n00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,160\nAnd see how it didn't pre fill in\nthose usernames and passwords,\n\n377\n00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,680\nyou've got to have that information.\n\n378\n00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,700\nNow, the end user can choose to save\nthat password if they want, but\n\n379\n00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,870\nit's just not there by default.\n\n380\n00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:33,960\n>> Hm.\n\n381\n00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,080\nA phone number.\n\n382\n00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,002\n>> A phone number, what's that all about?\n\n383\n00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:40,640\nSo [LAUGH] the CMAK is\nactually pretty old.\n\n384\n00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,420\nI mean, it, it's been updated, but it was\ndeveloped originally for dial-up service,\n\n385\n00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,620\nthat it had all the dial-up\ninformation in there.\n\n386\n00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,300\nSo it does, it does support dial-up,\nas well as VPN, and\n\n387\n00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,670\nit it looks like this one is expecting\nto dial in, which is kind of funny.\n\n388\n00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,700\n>> So, sure enough, so\n\n389\n00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,440\nyou must provide a phone number before\nyou can connect to the service.\n\n390\n00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,620\nSelect a phone number.\n\n391\n00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,881\n>> So, I wasn't paying attention when\nyou were filling in the service name,\n\n392\n00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,240\nand what did you put in,\nwhat did you put in for the VPN server?\n\n393\n00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,470\nDid you not fill that in?\n\n394\n00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,890\n>> Oh shoot, I guess not.\n\n395\n00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,850\n>> I was gabbing about something.\n\n396\n00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,055\nSo yeah, taking a look at it here, from\nthe client's side, when they look at it,\n\n397\n00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,480\nright, they've got their, their basic\nsetting saved as, and under options and\n\n398\n00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,514\nsharing, they don't really see\na whole ton, a lot of options, right?\n\n399\n00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:30,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But let's go ahead and, and\n\n400\n00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,840\ncancel out of that, Nate.\n\n401\n00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,800\nAnd let's just go into your network\nsettings, your, your network and\n\n402\n00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,340\nsharing center.\n\n403\n00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,060\n>> Yep,\nI must've just clicked right on past that.\n\n404\n00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,560\n>> And go into change adapter settings.\n\n405\n00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,600\nAnd let's pull up the properties\nof that VPN corp net.\n\n406\n00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,860\nAll right.\n\n407\n00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,210\nSo here it is complaining\nagain about a modem, so\n\n408\n00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,600\nthat means that it is set up as\na dial-up connection and not a VPN.\n\n409\n00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,380\nSo we chose incorrectly during the CMAK,\nand so\n\n410\n00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,210\nthis goes back to what I said earlier.\n\n411\n00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,790\nIt's important to test these packages.\n\n412\n00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,000\nIf you choose wrong in the CMAK, then\nit's gonna be wrong on the client side.\n\n413\n00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,045\nAnd If you you say no to that,\n\n414\n00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,635\nNate, I don't think you can change\nit from dial up to VPN, can you?\n\n415\n00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:14,165\n>> Uh-uh, nope, not in this little window.\n\n416\n00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:18,575\n>> All right, so with the CMAK,\nif something is wrong, well, this is where\n\n417\n00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:22,090\nyou have to go back and edit the package,\nyou basically have to, to redo it.\n\n418\n00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,820\nAnd you can either redo it from scratch,\nre-running through the CMAK, or\n\n419\n00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,460\nif you saved all your files, which you\ndid, we could go back and edit the files.\n\n420\n00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,375\nYou know, the CMAK will let you load\nthat file and modify it, all right.\n\n421\n00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, that actually kind of\n\n422\n00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,680\nworked out well, Nate, because it does\nshow us that, that that you know,\n\n423\n00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,520\nthe errors kind of cross over.\n\n424\n00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,780\nNow, if we were to set this up manually,\n\n425\n00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,600\nwe're basically providing\nthe same information.\n\n426\n00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,750\nAnd, and is that a manual one that\nyou set up on the right there?\n\n427\n00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,205\nThe one that says VPN connection?\n\n428\n00:19:48,205 --> 00:19:49,640\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Pull up the properties on that one.\n\n429\n00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:53,800\nAll right, let's take a look at all the\nthings that we would have to put in with\n\n430\n00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,010\na manual connection, all right?\n\n431\n00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,100\nWe start off by putting in an IP address.\n\n432\n00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,350\nSo the, you know, you gotta have an IP\naddress for the server to connect to.\n\n433\n00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,020\nIt does accept host names,\n\n434\n00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,100\nyou can do a DNS name instead of IP,\nyou know, sometimes that's easier.\n\n435\n00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,400\nAfter that,\n\n436\n00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,740\nif you take a look at options, there's\nnot a whole heck of a lot here, right?\n\n437\n00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,740\nYou, you've got whether you want it to\nremember the credentials and so on.\n\n438\n00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,380\nUnder security,\nhere's where we have the type of VPN,\n\n439\n00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,590\nwhich is probably\nthe most important field.\n\n440\n00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,185\nNow Nate,\nyou've got yours set to automatic.\n\n441\n00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:22,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n442\n00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,780\nautomatic works great if you're\nconnecting to a Microsoft server.\n\n443\n00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,180\nIf you're connecting to\na non-Microsoft server, though,\n\n444\n00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,030\nthis can be problematic, all right?\n\n445\n00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,950\nSo if you're building a VPN connection\nup to a Cisco VPN concentrator, or\n\n446\n00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,060\na Juniper SSG or something like that,\n\n447\n00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,240\nI find that the automatic detection\ndoesn't work the way that it should.\n\n448\n00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,270\nSo, when you drop that down,\n\n449\n00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,710\nyou'll see where you can manually\npick what it is you want to use.\n\n450\n00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,640\nPPTP, L2TP, IKE version 2.\n\n451\n00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,680\nIKE version 2 is what you want when\nyou're connecting to a Cisco device.\n\n452\n00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,980\nBut you might do L2TP when\nconnecting to a Juniper device.\n\n453\n00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,175\nSo you can hard set it and say this\nis the protocol I want to use, right?\n\n454\n00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:58,750\n>> Mm-hm.\nYou know,\n\n455\n00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,670\nwhen, when it is set on automatic, when\nthe STOs reach out and try to connect,\n\n456\n00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,300\nit will start with the most secure first.\n\n457\n00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n458\n00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,602\n>> So we'll start with that IV2 and\n\n459\n00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:11,150\nit will work its way down the list\nto the least secure which is PPTP.\n\n460\n00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,785\n>> And I, I think that's what\nmakes the other devices so angry.\n\n461\n00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:16,670\n[LAUGH] You know, like when you\nconnect to a Cisco device, and\n\n462\n00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,965\nit's like just kind of\nmoving down the line.\n\n463\n00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:20,610\n[LAUGH] That it just, it ticks them off.\n\n464\n00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,969\nBut on a Windows server, it works great.\n\n465\n00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:23,726\nYeah, and\nit does save you a lot of effort.\n\n466\n00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,110\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Cuz when you set up the VPN side\n\n467\n00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,500\non a Windows server,\nit's set to support all these protocols.\n\n468\n00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,065\nSo negotiating out the most secure\nis a pretty beneficial thing, right?\n\n469\n00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:31,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n470\n00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,270\n>> Well look at some of\nthese other settings.\n\n471\n00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,730\nWe would have to match here\nwhat's on the server, so\n\n472\n00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,670\nwe'd have to specify our EAP type, right,\nour Extensible Authentication Protocol or\n\n473\n00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,260\ntypes there we allow these protocols.\n\n474\n00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,385\nYou'll see the other authentication\ntypes at the bottom.\n\n475\n00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:48,260\nWe'd have to choose,\nthere's just a ton of room for error.\n\n476\n00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,730\nSo, when a VPN fails to connect,\nthis is one of the first things that I do,\n\n477\n00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,690\nis go through and look at all these\nsettings, to spot where the error is.\n\n478\n00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,600\nIf you use the CMAK, though, and\nyou already put these setting in there,\n\n479\n00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,620\nthen you know these are, are right, unless\nthe end user went and messed with them,\n\n480\n00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,780\ncuz that, that's always possible too.\n\n481\n00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,985\nThey, they can go back and,\nand manipulate the values.\n\n482\n00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:10,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n483\n00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,900\nAll right Don, so what so\nwhat do you think?\n\n484\n00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,730\n>> So so let's go ahead and just get,\nwe, we'll connect with this one and, and\n\n485\n00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,360\nuse it, and you,\nyou mentioned a problem earlier.\n\n486\n00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,290\nDoes the problem exist for\nthis connection too?\n\n487\n00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,230\n>> I believe so.\nYes, it should.\n\n488\n00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,870\n>> Well, there we go.\n\n489\n00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,500\nAll right.\n\n490\n00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,580\nSo let's go ahead and get connected.\n\n491\n00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,470\nNow, getting connected is\nthe first leg of our journey.\n\n492\n00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,330\nWhen we VPN in, and you know what?\n\n493\n00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,990\nDo this, Nate.\n\n494\n00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,115\nPut in a, incorrect password on purpose.\n\n495\n00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:34,490\n>> 'Kay.\n\n496\n00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,860\n>> Getting connected is the first leg\nof our journey, and, and usually,\n\n497\n00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,970\nif it's just misconfigured settings, it's\na matter of going through and looking for\n\n498\n00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,540\nwhich settings don't match the server,\nall right?\n\n499\n00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,090\nMaybe the server is set for\nMS Chat version two, and yours is set for\n\n500\n00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,010\nPAP, or, or whatever.\n\n501\n00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,810\nYou know, those are, aren't matching.\n\n502\n00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,800\nOnce they match you can connect up,\nand you're in business.\n\n503\n00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,000\nOther things like an incorrect password,\nit'll tell you.\n\n504\n00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,040\nSee where it says the username or\npassword is incorrect?\n\n505\n00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,520\nSo very visible error message right there.\n\n506\n00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,020\nYou will get other error messages\nfrom time to time though,\n\n507\n00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,330\nwhere it says something like failed\nto connect, Error 916, all right?\n\n508\n00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,480\nAnd you look at that and\nyou go, huh, great, 916.\n\n509\n00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,960\nWonderful.\n\n510\n00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,230\nRight?\nSo, so, those are our good errors,\n\n511\n00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,020\nwhere we have know idea\nwhere the heck they are.\n\n512\n00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,120\nAnd you can go into the event viewer,\nand potentially get more information, or\n\n513\n00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,790\ngo to Microsoft TechNet, and\nyou can find tons of information there.\n\n514\n00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,410\nWhere it will tell you, oh,\nthat's caused by a phase\n\n515\n00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,030\none negotiat- Initiation problem, so\nyou've got some settings that don't match.\n\n516\n00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,080\nBut at the end of the day,\nwhatever the error code number is,\n\n517\n00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,960\nit almost always just means\nsome settings don't match.\n\n518\n00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,985\nAnd so you just go through and\nverify your settings.\n\n519\n00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:37,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, so go ahead and\n\n520\n00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,350\nget connected.\n\n521\n00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,230\nNow once we're connected.\n\n522\n00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,700\nOh, oh here's a great one, error 812.\n\n523\n00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,260\nWonderful.\n\n524\n00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,760\nError 812.\n\n525\n00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,732\nLet's see

00:24:01,960\nBoy, that's a lot of, of stuff.\n\n530\n00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,050\nSo, something's wrong with\nour authentication method, I,\n\n531\n00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,880\nI'm guessing, based by the fact that they\nsay authentication like ten times in\n\n532\n00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,695\nthat sentence.\n\n533\n00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:10,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So so here it is giving us some,\n\n534\n00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,240\nsome good information.\n\n535\n00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,467\nArea 1-2.\n\n536\n00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,884\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well, like I said,\n\n537\n00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:16,860\nit's just our settings\nare probably not matching, right?\n\n538\n00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,907\nSo we need to verify What's on\nthe server versus what's on the client.\n\n539\n00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:23,580\nNow, Nate do you know\nthe server settings offhand?\n\n540\n00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,100\n>> Yes.\n\n541\n00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,150\nAnd they are indeed correct.\n\n542\n00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:26,805\n>> Okay.\n>> So,\n\n543\n00:24:26,805 --> 00:24:32,340\nthis is the year that I bumped in so\nI know that we put the fixes to it.\n\n544\n00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,380\n>> Okay.\n\n545\n00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,630\nSo in my experience, the way that we fix\nthis is we need to know what the settings\n\n546\n00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,780\nare on the server so that we can compare\nthe clients to it and match them up.\n\n547\n00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,903\nThis is an authentication error, so, Nate,\n\n548\n00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:53,357\ncan you pull up the properties\nof our VPN setting?\n\n549\n00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:55,473\nAnd if we go in here and\ngo under security,\n\n550\n00:24:55,473 --> 00:24:58,444\nyou'll see authentication is\nright there at the bottom.\n\n551\n00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:00,628\nWe got two choices, two radio buttons.\n\n552\n00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:05,225\nOne is if we're using EAP, and\nthe other one is if we're not using EAP,\n\n553\n00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:08,151\nif we're just using these other protocols.\n\n554\n00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:11,843\nWe are currently set to\nuse MS chat version 2 and\n\n555\n00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,600\nnot automatically using our credentials.\n\n556\n00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,940\nNow I don't know what\nthe server is set to.\n\n557\n00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,850\nDo you know?\n\n558\n00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,105\nAre you willing to tell or\ndo we have to find it out the hard way?\n\n559\n00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:25,069\n>> No but it's set up to use MS chat v 2.\n\n560\n00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:26,293\n>> Oh so they actually set the same.\n\n561\n00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,174\n>> Yes.\n\n562\n00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:29,518\n>> Crazy.\n\n563\n00:25:29,518 --> 00:25:30,832\n>> It's a strange error.\n\n564\n00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:35,529\nAnd I find it humorous cuz when I was\ngoing through and prepping this stuff\n\n565\n00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:41,080\nhere, I ran into this and I went back and\nforth, was like, well everything matches.\n\n566\n00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,438\nEverything is the same, and\nthen [NOISE], and then it clicked.\n\n567\n00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:45,996\n>> Okay.\n\n568\n00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,080\n>> And then, yeah.\n\n569\n00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,420\n>> Well the other thing that I'm thinking\nof, and this may or may not be true,\n\n570\n00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:57,130\nI don't know, but, because MS chat is\nweak authentication, a lot of times\n\n571\n00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,440\nWindows won't allow it to happen unless\nencryption is in place on the tunnel.\n\n572\n00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,910\nAnd the setting up above\nunder data encryption says,\n\n573\n00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:06,790\noptional encryption connect\neven if no encryption.\n\n574\n00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,940\nI don't know how the server is set,\nbut normally we don't want that.\n\n575\n00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,490\nNormally you do not want to\nconnect without encryption,\n\n576\n00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,860\nso that might be causing us to fail\nbefore we even get to authentication.\n\n577\n00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,960\nDo you know, is the server allowing\nnon-encrypted connections?\n\n578\n00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,640\n>> I'm not sure,\nI don't remember setting that setting.\n\n579\n00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,470\n>> Okay, well let's flip that and\n\n580\n00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,300\nsay require encryption\ndisconnect if server declines.\n\n581\n00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,351\nWhat's the point of having a VPN\ntunnel if you're not going to encrypt?\n\n582\n00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:35,150\nI should clarify, you know maybe you\njust want to do digital signatures.\n\n583\n00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,140\nAnd ensure that your data\ndoesn't get modified in transit.\n\n584\n00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,360\nYou don't need encryption for that.\n\n585\n00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,040\nBut, most people want encryption.\n\n586\n00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,570\nSo we can say okay to that and\ngive it a shot.\n\n587\n00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,930\nBut if we still get the same error,\n\n588\n00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,770\nthen there's another setting\nthat's apparently not right.\n\n589\n00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,894\nAnd we just need to compare the two.\n\n590\n00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:54,970\nAll right, same problem.\n\n591\n00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,510\nThe connection was prevented because\nof a policy configured on the server.\n\n592\n00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:03,839\nSo, when we connect to a VPN server,\nwe've got the settings on the server,\n\n593\n00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,158\nthe settings on the client.\n\n594\n00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:08,930\nAnd then if we've got a network policy\nserver, we have our policies also, and so\n\n595\n00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,660\nwe may need to go take a look at those.\n\n596\n00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,052\nAm I going off on a tangent, Nate?\n\n597\n00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:12,552\nOr is that?\n\n598\n00:27:12,552 --> 00:27:15,432\n>> No, yeah, that's a\n>> I don't want to turn this into\n\n599\n00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:16,460\na four hour show.\n\n600\n00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,225\nBut it is warning us about our policies,\nso we might as well take a look at those.\n\n601\n00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:24,340\nNow an error of this level,\nlike a policy error,\n\n602\n00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,580\nis normally going to affect all\nof our clients and not just one.\n\n603\n00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,130\nSo this would be a pretty\nhigh visibility error.\n\n604\n00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,870\nBut definitely possible.\n\n605\n00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:32,480\nWell, let's trip over to the server.\n\n606\n00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,460\nWe'll take a peek.\n\n607\n00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,566\n>> Yeah, Don, you are on the right track.\n\n608\n00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:41,930\nAnd fortunately, going over nap\nproblems is a part of our objectives so\n\n609\n00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:46,740\nthen diving into nap and seeing the I\nguess kind of problems and what not.\n\n610\n00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,270\n>> Oh sure, should we wait,\nis this a nap related issue or.\n\n611\n00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:50,786\n>> It could be.\n\n612\n00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:53,038\n[LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n613\n00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,138\n>> Let's go take a look at the policies.\n\n614\n00:27:55,138 --> 00:27:56,940\nSee if we can get this guy to VPN in.\n\n615\n00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,920\nSo we're going to talk a little bit later\nabout Network Access Protection, or NAP.\n\n616\n00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,160\nAnd it is built on top of\nthe Network Policy Server, or NPS.\n\n617\n00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,160\nAnd NPS basically has a set of rules that\ndefine who is allowed to connect, how they\n\n618\n00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,860\ncan connect, and when they can connect and\nwe really use that with NAP a lot.\n\n619\n00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,510\nWith VPN, it's kind of optional,\nthat you're really just checking to see\n\n620\n00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,870\ndoes somebody have permission to VPN in or\nnot.\n\n621\n00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,040\nAnd if they don't have permission\nto VPN in then we don't let them.\n\n622\n00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,706\nThat's what we normally all we do.\n\n623\n00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,296\nI say normally cuz Nate's\nsmiling over here so\n\n624\n00:28:28,296 --> 00:28:30,184\nhe's probably done something\ncrazy with the server.\n\n625\n00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:34,610\n[LAUGH] No, not fast enough?\n\n626\n00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,690\n>> Nope.\n>> Well let's take a look\n\n627\n00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,312\nat the server then.\n\n628\n00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:39,280\n>> All right should we,\nin the routing remote access or\n\n629\n00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,960\nin the network access policy?\n\n630\n00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,330\n>> Let's go into the network\npolicies server.\n\n631\n00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,702\n>> Okay.\n>> The one you didn't say.\n\n632\n00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:49,187\n>> [NOISE] All right,\n\n633\n00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:52,476\nhere we are.\n\n634\n00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,299\nI believe I have that still open.\n\n635\n00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,122\n>> There we go.\n\n636\n00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:57,512\nSo when you set up a VPN server and for\n\n637\n00:28:57,512 --> 00:29:02,157\nmore on this we really cover VPN\nservers in, what do we cover them in?\n\n638\n00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,719\nIn 410, 7410?\n\n639\n00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:04,670\n410 correct.\n\n640\n00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,220\n>> Okay.\n\n641\n00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,482\n>> So in the 74 10 show we show how to set\nup a VPN server and how to go through all\n\n642\n00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:13,827\nthis, so i don't want to spend too much\ntime troubleshooting a server issue.\n\n643\n00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:16,810\nBut as part of it we define\nour policies right in here.\n\n644\n00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,176\nAnd if you look at connection request\npolicies, when somebody VPNs in,\n\n645\n00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,756\nthese are the policies that\nare called to find out whether or\n\n646\n00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:26,989\nnot they should be allowed to get in.\n\n647\n00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:30,685\nAnd there's a default policy,\nwhich is actually the bottom one for Nate,\n\n648\n00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,338\nthat says use Windows authentication for\nall users.\n\n649\n00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:37,409\nAnd it basically states that,\non your user account,\n\n650\n00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:41,940\nif there's a permission that says,\nallow dial in access.\n\n651\n00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,420\nIt's got three options, what is it?\n\n652\n00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,290\nYes, no, or permit, deny and\nuse policy or something?\n\n653\n00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,090\n>> Yeah, I use NPS.\n\n654\n00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,720\n>> Okay.\n\n655\n00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,130\nSo, I don't know how that's set for\nour user accounts.\n\n656\n00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,870\nWe'd have to look there but it basically\nsays if that is set to yes, let them in,\n\n657\n00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,870\notherwise don't.\n\n658\n00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,530\nSo it's a pretty simple one and I assume\nthat's what that bottom policy still says.\n\n659\n00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,730\nBut you've created a new one.\n\n660\n00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,609\nSo you've got this nap VPN one, and\nwhat are its rules, what's its condition?\n\n661\n00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,885\n>> So this condition, so\nanybody who is making a VPN connection,\n\n662\n00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:18,540\nit will bring this out/.\n\n663\n00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,440\nSo any, so the condition right, VPN,\n>> Okay.\n\n664\n00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,660\n>> Will match this, and the settings for\n\n665\n00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,465\nit\n>> Says authentication method EAP.\n\n666\n00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:30,790\nSo this would not apply to us,\n\n667\n00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:36,500\nbecause we are connecting in,\nwe're using MS Chat Version two, right?\n\n668\n00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,494\nSo we're VPNing, but we're not using EAP,\nor we're not using true EAP, right?\n\n669\n00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:45,240\nAnd so, this one would match, this one\nwould not approve us to get in, right?\n\n670\n00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,360\n>> So really all we should have to do\nhere is to add in what we're using.\n\n671\n00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,285\nI don't remember.\nWe were using what, MS chat version two?\n\n672\n00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,520\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So why don't you go ahead and\n\n673\n00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,100\ncheck that off.\n\n674\n00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:57,720\nOr we really need to figure\nout which one is wrong.\n\n675\n00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,055\nIs it the server that's wrong or\nis it the client that's wrong?\n\n676\n00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:03,035\nSo, the server is set to, hey, use EAP.\n\n677\n00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:06,685\nIf that's what we're supposed to be doing\nthen we need to reconfigure our client\n\n678\n00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:07,230\nto use EAP.\n\n679\n00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,455\nSo, which one is wrong, Nate,\nthe server or the client?\n\n680\n00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:15,365\n>> I guess the server would be\nthe one that ends up being wrong.\n\n681\n00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:16,365\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n682\n00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:20,115\nSo, this isn't really like what we\nwould see on the 688 exam, right?\n\n683\n00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:23,970\nBut on the 410 and\nthen this would be a server type problem.\n\n684\n00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,140\nBut we've got that client set for MS Chat\nversion two, and that wasn't in our list.\n\n685\n00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,450\nSo we're just kind of\nadding it to the list.\n\n686\n00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,080\nSo now we're VPNing in, and we're using MS\nChat version two, so we should match this.\n\n687\n00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,280\nWhat else do we need to do here?\n\n688\n00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,090\nEverything else should be good, right?\n\n689\n00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,540\nAm I missing something?\n\n690\n00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,000\n>> No.\n\n691\n00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,940\n>> All right, so let's go ahead and\napply that, and just double check for\n\n692\n00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,660\nme the bottom one, that use Windows\nauthentication for all users.\n\n693\n00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,679\nPull that one up real quick.\n\n694\n00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,421\nLet's just double check this one, go to\nconditions, and so this one says day and\n\n695\n00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:01,718\ntime, it's just 24 hours a day,\nand go to settings.\n\n696\n00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:05,070\nAnd we've got no authentication turned on.\n\n697\n00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,740\nThis one's just wide open, isn't it?\n\n698\n00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,340\nOkay.\nAll right.\n\n699\n00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,503\nGo ahead and cancel out.\n\n700\n00:32:13,503 --> 00:32:14,327\nAll right.\n\n701\n00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,350\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee about connecting,\n\n702\n00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,795\nsee if that solves our problem.\n\n703\n00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,730\nRight now we've got our\napproved connection.\n\n704\n00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,884\nAnd we should need that.\n\n705\n00:32:22,884 --> 00:32:24,540\nAnd we still have our network policy too,\n\n706\n00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,919\nso if it still fails to connect\nwe need to take a look at that.\n\n707\n00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:43,500\nOkay, so our nap policy well it did\nhave that kind of disconnect in it.\n\n708\n00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,410\nStill a problem, right?\n\n709\n00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:46,080\nSo we need to look at\nthe second part of that policy,\n\n710\n00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,620\nthere's two parts to every policy.\n\n711\n00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,931\nSo let's jump back over to that server and\npeak at the second part of that policy.\n\n712\n00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:59,098\nAll right, so when you look up there\nwe've got connection request policies and\n\n713\n00:32:59,098 --> 00:33:01,380\nthen we have network policies.\n\n714\n00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,610\nThe connection request that's just to open\nup a connection in the first place and\n\n715\n00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,290\nthen the second part is to\nactually build that tunnel.\n\n716\n00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,860\nAnd you'll see here we've\ngot VPN connections,\n\n717\n00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,970\nwe've also got the DHCP\na few other things.\n\n718\n00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,008\nAnd there's some of the other default\npolicies you'll see that are disabled down\n\n719\n00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:19,650\ntowards the bottom,\ngranting and denying access.\n\n720\n00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,860\nSo let's take a look at the VPN 1 and\n\n721\n00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,650\nyou've got this all spec out for\nnap already.\n\n722\n00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:33,700\n>> I don't want to drag too far away\nfrom the scope of what we're at.\n\n723\n00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,100\nSo I'll just throw it out there.\n\n724\n00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,870\nIt's just a group problem.\n\n725\n00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:45,580\nSo it wasn't in the correct\ngroup to be allowed to dial in.\n\n726\n00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,072\n>> Okay, so you've got a policy in there\nthat restricting it to a particular group?\n\n727\n00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:54,465\nYeah, yeah, so if we yeah jump back into\nthe client there and we'll just go and\n\n728\n00:33:54,465 --> 00:34:01,830\nconnect and we use This guy\nthen it connects right away.\n\n729\n00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,700\nSo it's yeah, a group thing,\na person but yeah.\n\n730\n00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,960\n>> So this is one of those where we need\nto know those server settings, right?\n\n731\n00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,690\nTo know that, hey,\n\n732\n00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,240\nthe server's only allowing users\nin this particular group to VPN.\n\n733\n00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,090\nThe error message really not indicating\nthat type of a problem, right?\n\n734\n00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,780\nSaying, the authentication\ntype was not allowed.\n\n735\n00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,710\nNot saying, hey permission denied, right?\n\n736\n00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,095\nYou're not in a group permission denied,\nit was saying authentication not allowed.\n\n737\n00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:29,660\nSo, really kind of tricky\nthose error messages and\n\n738\n00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,340\nthat's the big problem with VPNing.\n\n739\n00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,610\nThat's why we have the is that we need\nto be able to manually set that stuff up\n\n740\n00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,920\nto understand on the server side so that\nthe clients don't have to worry about it,\n\n741\n00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,642\nso the end users don't\nhave to fuss with it.\n\n742\n00:34:41,642 --> 00:34:43,160\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n743\n00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,520\nAnd while we are connected into that VPN,\n\n744\n00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:52,450\nwe should be able to then get access\nour little network share down there and\n\n745\n00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:56,290\nsure enough soon as I put up,\nthere is a little red x on it.\n\n746\n00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:01,110\nSo we can get to that network share and\nthat all works and then I guess just\n\n747\n00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,980\nquickly then, we disconnect from it again.\n\n748\n00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,910\nAll right, so\nnow we're disconnected from that VPN and\n\n749\n00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,660\nwe try to get into our network share.\n\n750\n00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,590\nAnd it'll sit there and just grind and\nair out, so now it's no longer able to and\n\n751\n00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,610\nget into our internal network.\n\n752\n00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,720\n>> Excellent.\n\n753\n00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,410\nAll right, well I wanna do a little\nbit more troubleshooting on VPNs but\n\n754\n00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,180\nwe've kinda run a little over for\nour segment here.\n\n755\n00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,080\nSo let's do this,\nlet's stop and take a break.\n\n756\n00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,218\nAnd when we get back I wanna show you guys\nsome of the steps of isolating network\n\n757\n00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:32,196\nissues inside of a VPN.\n\n758\n00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,461\nAnd then we'll move on to some of the\nother topics that we've got so stay tuned,\n\n759\n00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:36,597\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n760\n00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:44,156\n[MUSIC]\n\n761\n00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:45,352\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n762\n00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,665\nSo I wanted to talk just\na little bit more about VPNs.\n\n763\n00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:51,745\nI think we've covered everything that\nMicrosoft wanted us to cover for\n\n764\n00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:52,695\nthe exam objective.\n\n765\n00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:55,845\nBut there's one more kind of\ntroubleshooting technique or\n\n766\n00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:56,625\nskill or tool,\n\n767\n00:35:56,625 --> 00:36:00,375\nwhatever, that can be really handy when\nit comes to troubleshooting these things.\n\n768\n00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,890\nBasically, when you VPN in\n\n769\n00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,130\nyour putting a special set of\nrouting instructions on your client,\n\n770\n00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:10,910\nthat says instead of sending traffic\nright out your network card like normal.\n\n771\n00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,120\nTo instead encapsulate it and\n\n772\n00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,590\nsend it to a particular destination and\nso we need to verify that that's working.\n\n773\n00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,510\nAnd Nate, Nate showed us one of\nthese easiest way to do that.\n\n774\n00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,630\nCould you access that network resources,\nyes or no, right?\n\n775\n00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,460\nYes, if you can.\n\n776\n00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,720\nGreat, VPN worked.\n\n777\n00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,160\nNo, if you can't.\n\n778\n00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,540\nWell, VPN doesn't work.\n\n779\n00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,270\nWell, where is it broken?\n\n780\n00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,820\nWhere is that problem, right?\n\n781\n00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,840\nSo I like to do what's called\npinging from the inside outside\n\n782\n00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,680\nto figure out where our failure occurs,\nright?\n\n783\n00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,340\nSo let's jump back over to to\nNate's workstation there and\n\n784\n00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,090\nwe'll take a look at it.\n\n785\n00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,030\nNate are we VPN in right now?\n\n786\n00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,970\n>> Yes.\n>> Perfect.\n\n787\n00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:50,030\n>> I believe so and\nwe can double check on that and yes.\n\n788\n00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,150\n>> Correct.\nVPN connected, wonderful.\n\n789\n00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,120\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, so go ahead and\n\n790\n00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,990\nopen up a command prompt.\n\n791\n00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,240\nAnd let's say that Nate was VPNed in,\nit says he's VPN'ed in.\n\n792\n00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,060\nBut for some reason, he's not able to\nconnect to resources on the network or\n\n793\n00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,340\nwhatever, all right?\n\n794\n00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,750\nSo what I like to do is just kind\nof run through a simple series of\n\n795\n00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,020\npings to figure out where\nthat failure occurs, right?\n\n796\n00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,840\nSo I usually start by pinging myself and\nI ping the loopback address,\n\n797\n00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,790\nlet's go ahead and do this,\n127, I mean you know it.\n\n798\n00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,810\nI'm telling you something\nyou already know, 127.0.0.1.\n\n799\n00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,000\nPinging the loopback is just a chance for\n\n800\n00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,565\nus to test the TCP/IP protocol stack,\nright?\n\n801\n00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:27,800\nJust software, verifying that\nsoftware works and that it's okay.\n\n802\n00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,790\nSo this one's good, where fine, right?\n\n803\n00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:35,580\nThen we can test our hardware by\npinging our own IP address, all right?\n\n804\n00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,880\nNow, I don't know what our IP address is,\nwhat is our IP?\n\n805\n00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,171\n10.1.230.77.\n\n806\n00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:48,819\nSo let's go ahead and ping 10.1.230.77\nthat's our network adapter for\n\n807\n00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:50,578\nour individual machine.\n\n808\n00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:59,260\nThis is actually gonna touch hardware\nwhen you ping your loopback,\n\n809\n00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,990\nit's just doing software.\n\n810\n00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,650\nThis is gonna to touch hardware and\nmake sure that we're actually able to\n\n811\n00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,810\ncommunicate with our network adapter,\nright?\n\n812\n00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,620\nSo if this fails, you probably\ngot a network driver type issue.\n\n813\n00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,880\nIf this passes, then you're good, right?\n\n814\n00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,750\nNow the next step is gonna differ\ndepending on whether we can connect with\n\n815\n00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,040\nour VPN or not.\n\n816\n00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,170\nIf the VPN failed outright,\nthe next thing I would need is the public\n\n817\n00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,870\nIP of the VPN server, all right?\n\n818\n00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,500\nIf I was able to connect,\n\n819\n00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,185\nthe next thing I'd ping would be\nthe private IP of the VPN server, okay?\n\n820\n00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:34,845\nSo, let's say for example.\n\n821\n00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,250\nWell, we already know we're VPN here.\n\n822\n00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,100\nIf it was a public IP though you could try\nand ping that and if that failed you could\n\n823\n00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,340\nuse trace wrap to see where on the\ninternet that connection failed, right?\n\n824\n00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,750\nBut we were able to VPN in so\n\n825\n00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,860\nthe next thing we can do is we can\nping the private IP of the VPN server.\n\n826\n00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,260\nNow, you wouldn't be able to ping\nthis if you weren't VPN in, right?\n\n827\n00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,430\nIt's a private IP, so\nlet's go ahead and ping that,\n\n828\n00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:02,060\nthis is the internal IP of the VPN server,\nall right?\n\n829\n00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:06,640\nNow this means we're coming in\none interface on the VPN server,\n\n830\n00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,020\nthe public interface.\n\n831\n00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,850\nAnd getting routed to the internal\ninterface on that VPN server.\n\n832\n00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,770\nIf this failed,\n\n833\n00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,520\nthat would tell me we got a problem\nwith routing inside of the VPN server.\n\n834\n00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,910\nBut it succeeded, so I know that we're\nable to jump from one interface to another\n\n835\n00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,380\non the VPN server itself, all right?\n\n836\n00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,350\nNow, you might say, okay, great,\nI can get to internal IPs, I'm done.\n\n837\n00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,367\nBut there could be more to it,\n\n838\n00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,737\ncan we access resources inside\nof our private network, right?\n\n839\n00:39:33,737 --> 00:39:36,199\nSo is there a IP of another\nmachine on the private network?\n\n840\n00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:41,634\n>> Yes, and that guy is 201, that's\nthe domain controller that you were using.\n\n841\n00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:42,726\n>> Okay, perfect.\n\n842\n00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:45,378\nSo now can we go through\nthe VPN server and\n\n843\n00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:49,600\nthen on to another host inside\nof the network, all right?\n\n844\n00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,080\nIf this succeeds, the VPN is working fine,\neverything's up, we're in good shape.\n\n845\n00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,970\nBut if this fails,\n\n846\n00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:02,250\nthen our problem is not normally going to\nbe the VPN as much as it is our routing.\n\n847\n00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,320\nThat this server that we're pinging\nmight now know how to get back to us.\n\n848\n00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,805\nAnd so we might have router issues that\nare stopping that traffic from flowing\n\n849\n00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:11,477\nthe right direction to get through.\n\n850\n00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:15,219\n>> The way to test that out is to take\na second client and have it VPN in and\n\n851\n00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:17,006\nsee if it can ping the same host.\n\n852\n00:40:17,006 --> 00:40:20,033\nIf they both fail, then you know that\nthis is gonna be a routing issue and\n\n853\n00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,580\nthat we need to correct that.\n\n854\n00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,238\nAll right.\n\n855\n00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:24,762\nAnd you can correct that\nwith like route statements,\n\n856\n00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:28,186\nmanual route statements on the server or\nworkstations or whatever, but\n\n857\n00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:31,180\nit's better to handle that on\nyour actual corporate routers.\n\n858\n00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,813\nThat's to say,\nthis VPN subnet goes this way and so on.\n\n859\n00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:36,329\nSo as to build those connections.\n\n860\n00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:36,841\nAll right.\n\n861\n00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:39,990\nSo simple process testing inside out.\n\n862\n00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,476\n>> So Don, so if we are able to\nget to the inside network, right?\n\n863\n00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:48,950\nSo the one, the 10.10.5.211, so\nthat VPN servers it's internal.\n\n864\n00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:54,159\nIf we're able to PNG that would\nyou say that routing would work?\n\n865\n00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:57,656\nThat we can get from the outside to\nthe inside and then touch that one and\n\n866\n00:40:57,656 --> 00:41:00,560\nthen make our way back and\nthen could you rule out routing at\n\n867\n00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,412\nthe point\n>> Well,\n\n868\n00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:04,210\nthat's a good questions right there.\n\n869\n00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,501\nWe can reach all the way to the inside and\nget a response back, so\n\n870\n00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:08,821\nwe know routing is good.\n\n871\n00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:10,650\nWhat protocol we use doesn't matter,\nright?\n\n872\n00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,878\nRouting is layer three and\nwhen we start stacking on HTTP, HTTPS,\n\n873\n00:41:13,878 --> 00:41:16,774\nall those other protocols\nthat's higher in the OSI model.\n\n874\n00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,460\nSo this should be good, right?\n\n875\n00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,073\nBut what about even beyond this?\n\n876\n00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:22,740\nWhat about internet access?\n\n877\n00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,338\nRight?\nI can reach my corporate network,\n\n878\n00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:25,770\ncan I browse the internet?\n\n879\n00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,709\nWell, that depends.\n\n880\n00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:29,250\nSome companies allow that,\nsome companies don't.\n\n881\n00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,516\nSo there may be some networks that we\ncan't access just based on how the VPN is\n\n882\n00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:37,930\nsetup and for that stuff, that's what\nwe really cover on that 7410 show.\n\n883\n00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,195\nOn the client side though, we just need\nto make sure we can get to those internal\n\n884\n00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:42,930\nresources and we're in business.\n\n885\n00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,209\nIf we need to get to the internet and\nour corporate policy doesn't allow it,\n\n886\n00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:49,706\nthen you just hang up your VPN and then\nyou go and you access the internet, right?\n\n887\n00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:52,470\nIt's based on what your company allows.\n\n888\n00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,940\nAll right.\n\n889\n00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,860\nSo, I think that's about it for VPN's.\n\n890\n00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,103\nCan you think of anything\nelse that we're leaving out?\n\n891\n00:41:58,103 --> 00:42:01,438\n>> No, it, I guess as far as\nwhat we're concerned here on\n\n892\n00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:04,278\nthe client side that yeah,\nthat covers that.\n\n893\n00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:05,134\n>> Perfect.\n\n894\n00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:05,869\nAll right.\n\n895\n00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:08,525\nSo trouble shooting VPNs,\ndefinitely something that you're gonna\n\n896\n00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:11,300\nencounter in real life,\nbecause VPNs are becoming so prominent.\n\n897\n00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,059\nRight?\n\n898\n00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,670\nWhat else is on our list?\n\n899\n00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,890\nRemote desktop, right?\n\n900\n00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,014\nGood old remote desktop.\n\n901\n00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:18,220\nI use it everyday,\nI think you do too, don't you?\n\n902\n00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,170\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, I use it every day.\n\n903\n00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,693\nAs a matter of fact,\nwe're using it right now.\n\n904\n00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,277\n>> Oh.\n[LAUGH] Oh, that's right.\n\n905\n00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:26,430\nYou remoted into these servers.\n\n906\n00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,159\n>> I forgot about that.\n\n907\n00:42:27,159 --> 00:42:29,002\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See, the technology's so\n\n908\n00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:30,518\nseamless that you forget you're using it.\n\n909\n00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:32,160\nThat's the sign of a good technology.\n\n910\n00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,508\n>> Yeah.\n\n911\n00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:34,269\n>> All right.\nI think\n\n912\n00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:37,645\neverybody's familiar with remote desktop\nby this point, at least you should be.\n\n913\n00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:42,260\nAnd it just allows us to see the desktop\nof our machine, even though we're remote.\n\n914\n00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,033\nRight?\nSo we can see it as if we were sitting in\n\n915\n00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:46,070\nfront of that machine, very convenient.\n\n916\n00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,873\nAnd for the most part,\npretty easy to setup.\n\n917\n00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:50,056\nRight?\nThere's, there's only so much to check.\n\n918\n00:42:50,056 --> 00:42:52,619\nIf you can't remote\ndesktop into your machine,\n\n919\n00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,790\nthere's usually just a couple\nof possible problems.\n\n920\n00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,220\nProblem number one,\nremote desktop might not be turned on.\n\n921\n00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,760\nRight?\n\n922\n00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,791\nIt is turned off by default,\nso we may need to enable that.\n\n923\n00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:02,690\nAll right.\n\n924\n00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,110\nProblem number two, it might be on, but\nit might have it's security settings set\n\n925\n00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,163\na way that is not compatible with\nthe client that you're using to connect.\n\n926\n00:43:11,163 --> 00:43:12,437\nSo when it comes from a desktop,\n\n927\n00:43:12,437 --> 00:43:15,089\nthe first things that we need to\ncheck are just our basic settings.\n\n928\n00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,168\nRight?\n\n929\n00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:18,620\nLet's take a look at that,\nyour on a client right now, Nate.\n\n930\n00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,246\nRight?\nWhy don't you bring up your remote\n\n931\n00:43:20,246 --> 00:43:21,110\ndesktop settings.\n\n932\n00:43:24,242 --> 00:43:27,620\nSo the remote desktop settings,\nwe can get to them several different ways.\n\n933\n00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:31,128\nLet's get to the settings for\nactually turning it on, so\n\n934\n00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:33,185\ngo in your system Control Panel.\n\n935\n00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:34,067\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n936\n00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:34,720\nOh, I see.\nI see.\n\n937\n00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,973\nI see.\n>> Yep.\n\n938\n00:43:36,973 --> 00:43:40,230\nSo remember, I mentioned remote\ndesktop is not turned on by default.\n\n939\n00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,627\nSo if I want to remote into this client\nmachine, I'm gonna need to turn it on.\n\n940\n00:43:44,627 --> 00:43:46,290\nAnd Nate, you've already turned it on.\n\n941\n00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,365\nRight?\nSo if you go to remote settings,\n\n942\n00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:49,630\nthere we go.\n\n943\n00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,142\nSo Nate's already got it turned on and\n\n944\n00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:53,609\nyou'll see there's not a whole\nheck of a lot of options here.\n\n945\n00:43:53,609 --> 00:43:56,620\nIt's the bottom of this options screen.\n\n946\n00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,919\nSo you've got choose an option,\nthen specify who can connect.\n\n947\n00:43:59,919 --> 00:44:02,767\nIf you choose allow remote\nconnections to the computer,\n\n948\n00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,820\nthat It turns remote desktop on.\n\n949\n00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,131\nIf you choose don't allow,\n\n950\n00:44:06,131 --> 00:44:08,816\nthen it's obviously not gonna\nallow anybody to connect.\n\n951\n00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:12,240\nBut when you choose it,\nthere's two things to pay attention to.\n\n952\n00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,509\nAll right?\n\n953\n00:44:13,509 --> 00:44:17,370\nFirst, there's a big check mark right\nthere that says, allow connections from\n\n954\n00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:22,210\ncomputers running remote desktop with NLA,\nnetwork level authentication recommended.\n\n955\n00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:22,878\nAll right.\n\n956\n00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:24,864\nWell, prior to Windows Vista,\n\n957\n00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:30,380\nmachines would connect with remote desktop\nprotocol and it wasn't very secure.\n\n958\n00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,672\nSo they didn't really\ndo any true encryption,\n\n959\n00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,069\nany strong encryption on the VPN.\n\n960\n00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:38,370\nI mean, on the remote desktop connections.\n\n961\n00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,412\nSo in Windows Vista, they introduced NLA,\n\n962\n00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:44,178\nwhich would encrypt the remote desktop\nconnection, but they made it optional.\n\n963\n00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:45,200\nAll right.\n\n964\n00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,473\nIf you're remoting into this\nsystem from Windows Vista or\n\n965\n00:44:48,473 --> 00:44:51,360\nhigher, you support NLA and\nyou connect that way.\n\n966\n00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,173\nBut if you're on a Windows XP machine and\nyou're trying to remote desktop into\n\n967\n00:44:55,173 --> 00:44:59,176\na Windows 8 machine, if this option is\nchecked, you will not be able to connect.\n\n968\n00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:01,910\nYou'll fail to connect,\nbecause you don't support NLA.\n\n969\n00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,790\nAl lright.\n\n970\n00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:06,079\nSo be aware of that and not just with\nWindows XP, cuz that's really old.\n\n971\n00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,134\nRight?\nMost of us aren't running Windows XP\n\n972\n00:45:08,134 --> 00:45:09,359\nanymore, hopefully.\n\n973\n00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,250\nBut you might be using a third\nparty remote desktop client, right?\n\n974\n00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,179\nIf you're got a third party RDP connect or\nsomething like that,\n\n975\n00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:19,231\nthey may not support NLA either.\n\n976\n00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,800\nAnd if they don't, then you won't be able\nto VPN in unless you turn that option off.\n\n977\n00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,847\nThat's a good a problem that can turn\nup with third party RDP clients.\n\n978\n00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:31,157\n>> Yeah.\nAnd by default, just standard users cannot\n\n979\n00:45:31,157 --> 00:45:36,465\nRDP into a machine, you have to be\na part of the administrator's group.\n\n980\n00:45:36,465 --> 00:45:40,954\nNow however, [COUGH] down here\non select users to have here.\n\n981\n00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:43,974\nWe can go in and add people in here and\n\n982\n00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:48,324\nwe want to allow to connect,\nso it says here, Don.\n\n983\n00:45:48,324 --> 00:45:49,622\nRight?\nSo we were signed in right now.\n\n984\n00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,172\nHe is a member of\nthe administrator's group.\n\n985\n00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,065\nSo he already has access to it.\n\n986\n00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:57,389\nAnd of course, anybody else who's a member\nof that administrator's group can get\n\n987\n00:45:57,389 --> 00:45:58,372\naccess into it.\n\n988\n00:45:58,372 --> 00:46:01,090\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that is very important, right?\n\n989\n00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,086\nBecause should we be logging in as\nan administrator on a regular basis?\n\n990\n00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:09,550\nNo, we should be logged in as a standard\nuser and so we want to VPN in as the,\n\n991\n00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,215\nI mean, I keep saying VPN.\n\n992\n00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:13,120\nWe want to RAPN as that standard user,\n\n993\n00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,568\nwe're gonna need to add\nourselves to this list.\n\n994\n00:46:15,568 --> 00:46:18,973\nIf you forget, you won't be able to\nconnect, unless you make yourself\n\n995\n00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:23,100\nan administrator, which again\nis not good security practices.\n\n996\n00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,715\nAll right.\n\n997\n00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:26,675\nSo definitely keep that in mind with RDP.\n\n998\n00:46:26,675 --> 00:46:30,691\nThe only other thing on the client side\nthat we really have to worry about with\n\n999\n00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:33,500\nremote desktop is the Windows firewall.\n\n1000\n00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,594\nIf you're gonna VP, geez.\n\n1001\n00:46:34,594 --> 00:46:36,647\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just can't out of this VPN rut\n\n1002\n00:46:36,647 --> 00:46:37,489\nthat I'm stuck in.\n\n1003\n00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:42,917\nIf we wanna RDP into this client,\nwell, RDP uses TCP port 3389 and\n\n1004\n00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:46,600\nwe're gonna have open\nthat up in the firewall.\n\n1005\n00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,440\nNow Windows does that for us automatically\nwhen you turn on remote desktop,\n\n1006\n00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,663\nit automatically opens it in the firewall.\n\n1007\n00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:56,587\nBut if your company is controlling\nthe firewall configuration, there might be\n\n1008\n00:46:56,587 --> 00:47:00,500\na GPO or something that is setting it and\nstopping that from being opened.\n\n1009\n00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,560\nSo you may need to verify that.\n\n1010\n00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,182\nYou go into your Windows firewall\nwith advanced security screen and\n\n1011\n00:47:05,182 --> 00:47:06,670\ncheck to see if it's open.\n\n1012\n00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,022\nDo you think we can find that, Nate?\n\n1013\n00:47:09,022 --> 00:47:12,474\nI hate to do these on the show sometimes,\ncuz they're so many rules in\n\n1014\n00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:17,330\nthe Windows Firewall settings that it\ncan take a while to find them sometimes.\n\n1015\n00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,317\nWe'll, see how fast, Nate is.\n\n1016\n00:47:18,317 --> 00:47:18,826\nRight?\n\n1017\n00:47:18,826 --> 00:47:20,451\nFastest firewall in the West?\n\n1018\n00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:22,737\n>> Yeah.\nOnce it catches up, there we go.\n\n1019\n00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:24,685\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll full screen that.\n\n1020\n00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:26,297\nI'll drag this over.\n\n1021\n00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:29,020\nAll right.\nAnd so since it's remote desktop, so\n\n1022\n00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,590\nwe're coming inbound.\n\n1023\n00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:31,715\nInbound to a machine.\n\n1024\n00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,300\nSo, it would be in\nthe inbound rules up there.\n\n1025\n00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,725\nAnd it should be pretty\nalphabetical order,\n\n1026\n00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:41,375\nso I'll just check for remote desktop.\n\n1027\n00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:45,171\nAll right.\nSo there we go.\n\n1028\n00:47:45,171 --> 00:47:48,442\nSo we have, [COUGH] a few in here.\n\n1029\n00:47:48,442 --> 00:47:56,250\nNow depending on our network location, so\nwhether it's on domain, public or private.\n\n1030\n00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,513\nWe have different ones here, so\nthere's two of these shadow TCP-IN.\n\n1031\n00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:01,560\nRight?\n\n1032\n00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,374\nSo one is for public, the other one\nis set for the domain profile and so\n\n1033\n00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:08,460\nwe have those set for domain.\n\n1034\n00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,875\nNow if this client machine,\nif it was on the public network station.\n\n1035\n00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:17,566\nThen remote desktop would not\nbe enabled as per these rules.\n\n1036\n00:48:17,566 --> 00:48:20,070\n>> Yeah, and you'll see that for\neach of the remote desktop rules.\n\n1037\n00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,490\nSo then you've got\nRemote Desktop User Mode and\n\n1038\n00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:27,000\nthen I guess you just have\nthe four there for User Mode.\n\n1039\n00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,220\nAnd, you'll see on those where public,\nit's turned off, domain, it's turned on.\n\n1040\n00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,430\nSo, you may need to tweak those\nto get the settings that you need\n\n1041\n00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,020\nto enable that to connect.\n\n1042\n00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:36,640\nAll right.\n\n1043\n00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,420\nSo definitely pay attention\nto those firewall rules.\n\n1044\n00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,180\nRemember TCP port 3389,\nthat's what's used by default.\n\n1045\n00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,770\nAll right,\n\n1046\n00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,870\ncouple other things that we need to think\nabout with Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n1047\n00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,920\nIf your workstation is\nIs behind a NAT router.\n\n1048\n00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,030\nWhen somebody tries to connect to you,\n\n1049\n00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,160\nthey're trying to connect\nto your public IP.\n\n1050\n00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,900\nIf that public IP is hosted by the router,\nand\n\n1051\n00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,030\nyou're NATTed behind it, the router\nwon't know to connect to your client.\n\n1052\n00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:05,520\nSo, you may need to set up port forwarding\nto forward port 3389 down to your\n\n1053\n00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,860\nclient to connect.\n\n1054\n00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,910\nThat's fine if it's just\nyour machine at home.\n\n1055\n00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,140\nA lot of us do that.\n\n1056\n00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,130\nI do that with my own at home.\n\n1057\n00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,860\nIt's fine if you just have one machine.\n\n1058\n00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,910\nBut if you're a business, you might\nhave a hundred, a thousand machines\n\n1059\n00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:20,010\nthat you wanna enable this for and port\nforwarding is not an option at that point.\n\n1060\n00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,090\nIt's also not an option to assign a static\nIP to all of your different clients.\n\n1061\n00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:29,924\nSo instead, we might bring in something\nlike a Terminal Services Gateway,\n\n1062\n00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:34,467\nor TSG server, or now it's called\na Remote Desktop Gateway Services.\n\n1063\n00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:36,120\nIs that right?\nRemote Desktop Gateway Services.\n\n1064\n00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,989\n>> Yeah,\njust straight up Remote Desktop Gateway.\n\n1065\n00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:38,628\n>> Okay.\n\n1066\n00:49:38,628 --> 00:49:42,870\nSo, we can set up a server that\nhandles that translation for us.\n\n1067\n00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:47,470\nPeople remote to the server and the server\nproxies them on into the client, right?\n\n1068\n00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:52,164\nNow do you know which show we covered\nthat in, is that in 74-11 or 74-10?\n\n1069\n00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:53,450\nOne of those.\n>> 4-10, I believe.\n\n1070\n00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,070\n>> Okay.\n\n1071\n00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,730\nSo we cover how to set that server up in\nthe server show, but on the client side,\n\n1072\n00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,160\nit's actually really simple.\n\n1073\n00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,200\nAll you have to do is tell Remote Desktop,\nwhen you're about to connect in say,\n\n1074\n00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,520\ndon't try and go directly to this machine,\ninstead go to this gateway server.\n\n1075\n00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,145\nRight?\nNate, you wanna show how to set that up?\n\n1076\n00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:10,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1077\n00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:11,830\nYeah.\n\n1078\n00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,505\n>> Fire up the Remote Desktop Client and.\n\n1079\n00:50:18,097 --> 00:50:22,129\nAll right, so normally here in the Remote\nDesktop Client under the computer name we\n\n1080\n00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:25,210\nwould just punch in our computer's\nIP address or our name.\n\n1081\n00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:25,840\nRight?\n\n1082\n00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,890\nBut if it's a private IP,\nif it's 192.168.0.55, and\n\n1083\n00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:33,040\nyou're out there on the internet,\nthat's not gonna work.\n\n1084\n00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,520\nIf you VPN into your corporate\nenvironment it'll work, but\n\n1085\n00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,150\njust straight out over the internet,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n1086\n00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,700\nBut if you have a gateway server,\nyou could type in your private IP there.\n\n1087\n00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,680\nAnd then you go into your Options,\nand go to Advanced.\n\n1088\n00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,830\nAnd at the bottom you'll\nsee Connect from anywhere.\n\n1089\n00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,940\nThis is the gateway services.\n\n1090\n00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,300\nAnd if we choose that,\n\n1091\n00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,810\nyou can punch in a Remote Desktop Gateway\nserver to relay your connection through.\n\n1092\n00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:03,530\nSo while you may not have a direct\nconnection to the internal IP of your\n\n1093\n00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,570\nhost, you can bounce through\nthis gateway server.\n\n1094\n00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,100\nAll right?\n\n1095\n00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,440\nGo ahead and choose that.\n\n1096\n00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,626\nAnd basically,\nyou just put in the server name and\n\n1097\n00:51:10,626 --> 00:51:12,825\nhow you want to authenticate against it,\nright?\n\n1098\n00:51:12,825 --> 00:51:17,900\nSo let's say it is rd.itpro.tv, right?\n\n1099\n00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,330\nSo maybe we've got a server called\nrd.itpro.tv and that's our gateway server.\n\n1100\n00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,620\nNow somebody would have\nto set that server up and\n\n1101\n00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,480\nput it on the boundary of our network,\nand we don't have that.\n\n1102\n00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,611\nBut you punch that in there, and\nthen you specify how to authenticate.\n\n1103\n00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:33,434\nAll right?\nIf you drop that box down,\n\n1104\n00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:37,820\nyou'll see you've got two choices,\nwhich is NTLM and Smart card, right?\n\n1105\n00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,100\nIf you got a Smart card, great,\nthat's the best way to do it.\n\n1106\n00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,510\nA lot of us don't, and so we can use NTLM.\n\n1107\n00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,390\nIf you leave it to auto,\nit'll just figure it out as it goes,\n\n1108\n00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:50,020\nbut it does make things a little\nfaster if you go ahead and specify it.\n\n1109\n00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,740\nAll right?\n\n1110\n00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,780\nSo, we can set that option right there,\n\n1111\n00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:57,270\nand now it's saying when I try to connect,\nrelay through this other server.\n\n1112\n00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,690\nNow, we can hit OK and\ngo back to our Connection screen.\n\n1113\n00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:04,440\nAnd on our Connection screen we can\njust punch in, or under General, yeah.\n\n1114\n00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,330\nWe can punch in the internal IP or\ninternal host name of that client\n\n1115\n00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,870\nbecause we're not connecting\ndirectly to it anymore.\n\n1116\n00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:13,590\nWe're gonna connect to this public server,\nand tell that server,\n\n1117\n00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,910\nhey can you connect to my workstation for\nme?\n\n1118\n00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,990\nAnd it will do that, it'll establish that\nconnection to the internal workstation and\n\n1119\n00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:21,520\nthen render that screen to you, right?\n\n1120\n00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,212\nSo it's like a remote desktop proxy.\n\n1121\n00:52:23,212 --> 00:52:23,827\nRight?\n\n1122\n00:52:23,827 --> 00:52:25,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The common mistake we see here\n\n1123\n00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,010\nis simply typos,\nnot choosing the right server name,\n\n1124\n00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,791\nnot choosing the right\nauthentication method.\n\n1125\n00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:35,582\nBut aside from that, there's not really\nmuch else that can go wrong there.\n\n1126\n00:52:35,582 --> 00:52:42,265\n>> Yeah, now so\nthat's one way to key this up now.\n\n1127\n00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:46,055\nBefore the show,\nthere was another way as well.\n\n1128\n00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:50,161\nWe can just take a peek\nat that real quick.\n\n1129\n00:52:50,161 --> 00:52:51,821\nAnd up into here.\n\n1130\n00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:58,301\nAll right, so if we go https://\n\n1131\n00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:03,368\n[SOUND] And we'll click on Continue.\n\n1132\n00:53:03,368 --> 00:53:08,840\nSo, yeah, I didn't load in the machine\nthat server's certificate here.\n\n1133\n00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,130\nSo right now we're browsing\nto that router remote access.\n\n1134\n00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,960\n>> The gateway.\n\n1135\n00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,590\n>> Yep, the gateway.\n\n1136\n00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,623\nAnd it's running that roll onto it.\n\n1137\n00:53:18,623 --> 00:53:21,154\nAnd so now we can go through it this way.\n\n1138\n00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:27,406\nLet's say we'll just go ahead and\nenter in that now we're.\n\n1139\n00:53:31,881 --> 00:53:32,473\nAll right?\n\n1140\n00:53:32,473 --> 00:53:38,136\nAnd on here, this has some remote apps,\nso if we wanted to run some of these and\n\n1141\n00:53:38,136 --> 00:53:41,990\nhave it run here but\nexecuting there on that server.\n\n1142\n00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,200\nOr if we want to connect to a remote PC,\n\n1143\n00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,142\nthen we can go this way as well, and\nwe can just key in that PC here.\n\n1144\n00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:55,195\nWe'll run it full screen, run it in little\ndifferent sizes there, and that sort, so.\n\n1145\n00:53:55,195 --> 00:53:57,365\nAnother just two ways\nto do the same thing.\n\n1146\n00:53:57,365 --> 00:53:57,925\n>> Yeah.\n\n1147\n00:53:57,925 --> 00:54:00,725\nThe cool part about using the web\ninterface like this is that there's\n\n1148\n00:54:00,725 --> 00:54:01,775\nlittle room for error.\n\n1149\n00:54:01,775 --> 00:54:03,285\nRight?\nThe end user just goes in and\n\n1150\n00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:04,265\npunches in their machine name.\n\n1151\n00:54:04,265 --> 00:54:07,075\nThey don't have to worry about oh,\ndo I punch in the gateway,\n\n1152\n00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:08,525\ndo I do this or whatever?\n\n1153\n00:54:08,525 --> 00:54:10,525\nAnd so this works out pretty well.\n\n1154\n00:54:10,525 --> 00:54:13,765\nIt's building it over a web\nconnection to the gateway server.\n\n1155\n00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:16,215\nIt's 3389 for the remote desktop side, but\n\n1156\n00:54:16,215 --> 00:54:18,375\nthey don't have to know\nabout that gateway.\n\n1157\n00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,270\nSo this does make things\na little more simple.\n\n1158\n00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,780\nThis is a cool service that was introduced\nby Microsoft several versions ago,\n\n1159\n00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,460\nthey've kinda made it better and better.\n\n1160\n00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,644\nInitially it was just this screen, so you\ncould use Remote Desktop and that was it.\n\n1161\n00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:33,634\nThey added the remote app stuff later on,\nwhich is almost like Citric MetaFrame or\n\n1162\n00:54:33,634 --> 00:54:35,092\nXenApp, or whatever.\n\n1163\n00:54:35,092 --> 00:54:36,850\nYou get some real powerful\nfunctionality out of that.\n\n1164\n00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,625\nSo, really cool stuff.\n\n1165\n00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1166\n00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,390\n>> But yeah, so just remember when\nwe go to deal with this stuff,\n\n1167\n00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,570\nif we're using the Remote Desktop Client,\nthere's room for error.\n\n1168\n00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,120\nBecause we have to type in those values.\n\n1169\n00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,166\nIf we're using the web\ninterface like this, well,\n\n1170\n00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,318\neither they get to the web page or\nthey don't, right?\n\n1171\n00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:52,319\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz [LAUGH] that's\n\n1172\n00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:53,744\npretty hard to make a mistake here.\n\n1173\n00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:56,247\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah, and you know Don, and\n\n1174\n00:54:56,247 --> 00:55:01,358\nfrom the client point of view,\nthat's really as far as the errors go.\n\n1175\n00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:05,410\nIs just incorrectly entering\nin the IP address, or\n\n1176\n00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,015\nany kind of credentials,\nand logging in that way.\n\n1177\n00:55:08,015 --> 00:55:12,780\nBut the real bulk of where errors do\ncome across is on the server side.\n\n1178\n00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,510\nAnd of course, up to the client\nthen to relay any errors come up.\n\n1179\n00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:18,810\nAnd help kind of troubleshoot things.\n\n1180\n00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:19,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n1181\n00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,510\nYep and then just keep in mind\nthat there's always all sorts\n\n1182\n00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,950\nof other crazy things that could happen.\n\n1183\n00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,593\nYou could have some kind of\nhost based internet filter,\n\n1184\n00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:32,943\nor whatever, installed on your\nmachine that could get in the way.\n\n1185\n00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:34,824\nBut as far as the basic settings go,\n\n1186\n00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:38,740\nthere's not really all that much that\ncan go wrong on the client's side.\n\n1187\n00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:43,790\nAll right, the last thing we've got on our\nlist is NAP, Network Access Protection,\n\n1188\n00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:46,320\nand that's gonna take us a little\nbit of time to get through.\n\n1189\n00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,199\nSo, why don't we do this, Nate?\n\n1190\n00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,480\nWhy don't we stop here and take a break?\n\n1191\n00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,819\n>> Yeah.\n>> And when we get back,\n\n1192\n00:55:49,819 --> 00:55:51,873\nwe're gonna jump into\nNetwork Access Protection,\n\n1193\n00:55:51,873 --> 00:55:54,032\ntake a look at some of the stuff\nthat can go wrong there.\n\n1194\n00:55:54,032 --> 00:55:54,577\nSound good?\n\n1195\n00:55:54,577 --> 00:55:55,339\n>> Yep, sounds great.\n\n1196\n00:55:55,339 --> 00:55:57,463\n>> All right,\nstay tuned we'll be back in a few.\n\n1197\n00:55:57,463 --> 00:56:05,277\n[MUSIC]\n\n1198\n00:56:05,277 --> 00:56:06,914\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1199\n00:56:06,914 --> 00:56:07,973\nIn our final segment,\n\n1200\n00:56:07,973 --> 00:56:10,830\nwe're gonna be taking a look\nat Network Access Protection.\n\n1201\n00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:15,548\nAnd I know we talked about it a little bit\nearlier, but if you've never heard of NAP,\n\n1202\n00:56:15,548 --> 00:56:19,886\nit's just a super cool service that's\nbuilt into Windows Server 2012.\n\n1203\n00:56:19,886 --> 00:56:24,802\nAnd, what it allows us to do is, when\na client connects to our network via VPN,\n\n1204\n00:56:24,802 --> 00:56:28,396\nDACP, whatever,\nhowever they connect to our network.\n\n1205\n00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:30,786\nThat we can run assorted\nhealth checks on them,\n\n1206\n00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:35,225\nto make sure that they meet the minimum\nrequirements to connect to our network.\n\n1207\n00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,885\nDo they have antivirus installed?\n\n1208\n00:56:36,885 --> 00:56:38,295\nHave they run a virus scan?\n\n1209\n00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:40,225\nHave they been doing\ntheir Windows updates?\n\n1210\n00:56:40,225 --> 00:56:41,795\nWe can evaluate this stuff.\n\n1211\n00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:45,195\nAnd if a client doesn't\nmeet our requirements,\n\n1212\n00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:49,185\nwe can block them off of the network and\nnot allow them access, all right.\n\n1213\n00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:51,465\nSo, what we need to do is we\nneed to take a look at that and\n\n1214\n00:56:51,465 --> 00:56:53,775\nsee what it looks like on the client side.\n\n1215\n00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:56,150\nYou know, how is the client\ngoing to experience this?\n\n1216\n00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,090\nWhat do they do with\nthe information they get.\n\n1217\n00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,850\nAnd then how do they get\nhealthy on the network again?\n\n1218\n00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,710\nAll right?\nAnd, Nate,\n\n1219\n00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,690\nyou've got a demonstration set up for\nus, right?\n\n1220\n00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,600\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n1221\n00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,240\n>> Yep. All right. So, I've got\nthis client machine right here, and\n\n1222\n00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,065\nthese on our little network that\nwe've been using so far today.\n\n1223\n00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:15,710\nAnd, yeah, should we get right into\nthe thing and show the error thrown up?\n\n1224\n00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:16,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n1225\n00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,165\nLet's go full screen,\n\n1226\n00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:19,780\ncuz I think we're gonna need to see our-\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1227\n00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,980\n>> System, whatever that thing's called,\nlittle tray at the bottom right.\n\n1228\n00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,630\nThe notification area, there we go.\n\n1229\n00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:25,880\nI can use the right term.\n\n1230\n00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,930\n>> All right.\nSo here's our client here.\n\n1231\n00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:32,960\nAnd this guy, he does have the network\naccess protection, on, enabled.\n\n1232\n00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,020\nIt, it's running.\n\n1233\n00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:37,940\nAnd so it's evaluating its,\nthis machine's health.\n\n1234\n00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,825\n>> It's evaluating its life choices.\n\n1235\n00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:44,465\n[LAUGH]\n>> So we'll go into action center,\n\n1236\n00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:47,478\nthat's just a little quick way to\nget into the Windows Firewall.\n\n1237\n00:57:47,478 --> 00:57:50,576\nAnd one of the settings\nin there is whether or\n\n1238\n00:57:50,576 --> 00:57:53,940\nnot all the firewall is turned on.\n\n1239\n00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,460\nSo what we will simply do is turn\none of them off, we'll click on OK,\n\n1240\n00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,460\nand we'll get two little balloons.\n\n1241\n00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,210\nOne that says, turn on your firewall.\n\n1242\n00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,450\nAnd the second one, which I will click on.\n\n1243\n00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,110\nThis guy right here.\n\n1244\n00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:07,030\nNetwork access protection.\n\n1245\n00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,670\nSo this guy pops up right here and\n\n1246\n00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:14,250\ntells us that we are no longer\nin compliance with our policies.\n\n1247\n00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:19,440\nSo we click on here and so some security\nhealth agent, right, is unsuccessful.\n\n1248\n00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:19,950\nYadda, yadda.\n\n1249\n00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:24,100\nWe kind of read through some if it and\nthat's really it.\n\n1250\n00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,200\nSo the health agent cannot update\nthe security state, all right, and\n\n1251\n00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,900\nthe result's right down there and\nit tells us what it is that we need to do.\n\n1252\n00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,770\nSo the remediation results,\nan administrator must enable a firewall\n\n1253\n00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,990\nprogram that is compatible with\nthe Windows Security Center service.\n\n1254\n00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,640\nSo there we go.\n\n1255\n00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,420\n>> Yep.\nNow, keep in mind if you're the end user,\n\n1256\n00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,770\nyou're getting this message,\nyou're not able to connect to the network.\n\n1257\n00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:51,480\nYou're now in what's called\na remediation network.\n\n1258\n00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,060\nYou will show as being on the network.\n\n1259\n00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,330\nYou, you know, your network\nadapter will show a link light.\n\n1260\n00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,000\nYou'll have an IP address.\n\n1261\n00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,520\nBut if you start trying to access internal\nnetwork resources, you're only gonna\n\n1262\n00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,392\nbe able to access what your network\nadmins have deemed as acceptable, right?\n\n1263\n00:59:06,392 --> 00:59:10,470\nSo, looking at Nate's machine there,\nhe's got an internal IP.\n\n1264\n00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:14,750\nBut he's now being filtered so\nhe can only access certain hosts.\n\n1265\n00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,492\nWhen somebody builds a remediation\nnetwork what they normally do is put\n\n1266\n00:59:17,492 --> 00:59:19,603\nenough servers on there to\nbe able to fix your problem.\n\n1267\n00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:23,635\nSo if you have a requirement that says\nvirus definitions have to be up to date,\n\n1268\n00:59:23,635 --> 00:59:28,040\nthen the remediation network will normally\njust have access to antivirus servers so\n\n1269\n00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,180\nthat we can update our definitions.\n\n1270\n00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:30,740\nRight?\n\n1271\n00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,390\nOtherwise, you block somebody off and have\nno chance of getting onto your network.\n\n1272\n00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,825\nHere they at least have\na chance to make good.\n\n1273\n00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:36,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1274\n00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,020\n>> Same thing with, like, Windows Updates.\n\n1275\n00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,800\nIf we require them to have\ndone Windows Updates, their\n\n1276\n00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,270\nremediation network might allow them just\naccess to the Windows Updates website.\n\n1277\n00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:48,340\nAnd that way they can do their updates and\nbecome current, all right?\n\n1278\n00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:52,620\nSo, in this case,\nNate's machine is not in compliance, so\n\n1279\n00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,160\nhe's getting a message popping\nup that's telling him hey,\n\n1280\n00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,090\nNate you're not allowed to connect and\nhere's why, your firewall's not turned on.\n\n1281\n01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:00,710\nOkay?\n\n1282\n01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,110\nSo if we turn the firewall back on,\nwhat happens?\n\n1283\n01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,270\nLet's find out.\n\n1284\n01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:11,015\n>> We'll go in here and we will enable\nthat firewall so it'll flag down there,\n\n1285\n01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:15,110\nright, so, it doesn't take very\nlong at all, it turns from a red x,\n\n1286\n01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,830\nall right, and then sure enough,\nso here we go.\n\n1287\n01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:20,660\nNow this computer meets\nthe security standards set by\n\n1288\n01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,050\nour network administrator, cool.\n\n1289\n01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,955\n>> So, for the end user, they really\njust need to be able to read, right?\n\n1290\n01:00:27,955 --> 01:00:31,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Read that status message that pops up.\n\n1291\n01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:37,000\nI do want to mention one other thing that\ncan make NAP do a false block or whatever.\n\n1292\n01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,950\nAnd that is, in order for\nnetwork access protection to work,\n\n1293\n01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,640\nthe client has to be able to evaluate\nwhether it's in compliance or not.\n\n1294\n01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,500\nAnd it does that through a service.\n\n1295\n01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,730\nNate, can you bring up your\nservices administrative tool.\n\n1296\n01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:53,245\nThere is a service that's running\nthat's called, if I remember right,\n\n1297\n01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:55,186\nthe Network Access Protection Client.\n\n1298\n01:00:55,186 --> 01:00:59,806\nAnd if that client is stopped,\nright, if somebody's disabled it, or\n\n1299\n01:00:59,806 --> 01:01:05,060\nwhatever, then that's gonna make it where\nwe can't possibly pass a NAP check.\n\n1300\n01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,470\nWe might meet all the requirements.\n\n1301\n01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:07,868\nWe might have done our Windows updates,\n\n1302\n01:01:07,868 --> 01:01:10,600\nrun our antivirus,\nhave our firewall turned on.\n\n1303\n01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,609\nBut if the NAP client is not running to\nevaluate it then, then we don't know.\n\n1304\n01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:15,130\nRight.\n\n1305\n01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,520\noh, it's called the NAP agent.\n\n1306\n01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,390\nThe Network Access Protection Agent.\n\n1307\n01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,965\nI was close.\n\n1308\n01:01:18,965 --> 01:01:19,472\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1309\n01:01:19,472 --> 01:01:21,840\n>> Client agent, whatever, [LAUGH].\n\n1310\n01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,580\nSo you can see where Nate's is set\nto automatic and it's started.\n\n1311\n01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:30,823\nIf your IT department has turned on NAP,\nthey've probably written a policy that\n\n1312\n01:01:30,823 --> 01:01:35,853\nsays, manually, or automatically turn\non this process and get it running.\n\n1313\n01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:39,319\nBut if this is a new deployment,\nif you've got machines that aren't\n\n1314\n01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:43,470\njoined to your domain, they don't have to\nbe joined to the domain for NAP to work.\n\n1315\n01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,263\nIf that's the case,\nyou may need to come and\n\n1316\n01:01:45,263 --> 01:01:48,186\nstart this and not just start it\nbecause it's set to manual by default.\n\n1317\n01:01:48,186 --> 01:01:51,070\nSo if you just start it, the next\ntime you reboot it will be off again.\n\n1318\n01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:53,040\nSo you really need to change to automatic.\n\n1319\n01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,764\nTell it to start up automatically,\n\n1320\n01:01:54,764 --> 01:01:57,870\nthat way we're able to communicate\nwith NAP boxes, all right?\n\n1321\n01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:01,220\nNow Nate, do you remember,\ncuz I'm not sure that I do,\n\n1322\n01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:05,890\nthe NAP agent itself was introduced\nin Vista if I remember correctly.\n\n1323\n01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:09,750\nAnd if you're running an earlier operating\nsystem than that like Windows XP it\n\n1324\n01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:12,810\ndoesn't have the NAP agent on it and\nyou have to install it.\n\n1325\n01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:15,350\nSo you can get that from\nthe Windows Server machine or\n\n1326\n01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,580\nwhatever to install it on there.\n\n1327\n01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:19,240\nBut Windows 8, what's on the exam,\nit's got it built in.\n\n1328\n01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,030\nWe just have to turn it on.\n\n1329\n01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:22,010\n>> Mm-hm, yeah you know,\n\n1330\n01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:27,610\non the network configuration you see\nthat when we were not in compliance.\n\n1331\n01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,792\nSo it,\nit moved me into that remediation network.\n\n1332\n01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:33,740\nSo it's, so changing here it\ntook away the gateway here.\n\n1333\n01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:37,290\nAnd on the server side there is that\nremediation network that's set up,\n\n1334\n01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:42,930\nthat when this policy kicks in,\nyou can only talk to these guys over here.\n\n1335\n01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:46,410\nAnd we can see a period, restricted.net so\n\n1336\n01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:48,800\nwe know that we're in\nthat remediation network.\n\n1337\n01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:54,190\nAfter we fixed it, and ran good old IP\nconfig again, we see it gave me that\n\n1338\n01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:58,040\ngateway back, and it put me back\nin our regular business network.\n\n1339\n01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,990\nHere we are back in class.\n\n1340\n01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:04,100\n>> And so he's got the same IP,\nit was 10.10.5.221 both times.\n\n1341\n01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,432\nSo NAP has special filtering that\ninteracts with the operating system to\n\n1342\n01:03:07,432 --> 01:03:08,312\nblock that stuff.\n\n1343\n01:03:08,312 --> 01:03:11,145\nAnd the subnet mask and\ndefault gateway populating so yeah.\n\n1344\n01:03:11,145 --> 01:03:15,420\nNow he gets that full access all being\ncontrolled by the protection servers.\n\n1345\n01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,960\nIt's a great idea, especially in this\nbring your own device age, right?\n\n1346\n01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,700\nWhere people are bringing their\nown laptops and stuff from home.\n\n1347\n01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,890\nNAP gives us the ability to say,\nare you taking care of your machines?\n\n1348\n01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,010\nAre you doing the proper preventative\nmethods to ensure that you're not getting\n\n1349\n01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:34,500\ninfected and getting spyware and all\nthat other crazy stuff on your machine.\n\n1350\n01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,350\nWe can enforce that.\n\n1351\n01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:36,440\nSo really cool stuff.\n\n1352\n01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1353\n01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,310\nYeah.\nNow there are some commands on there,\n\n1354\n01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:45,300\nthat we can kind of view the status so\nwe can see what is being pushed out to us.\n\n1355\n01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,470\nAnd those are good old netsh commands.\n\n1356\n01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:49,310\nDon, do you remember all of your netsh?\n\n1357\n01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:50,700\n>> Oh, of course I got them memorized.\n\n1358\n01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,268\nI use them every day.\n\n1359\n01:03:51,268 --> 01:03:52,186\n>> Right?\n\n1360\n01:03:52,186 --> 01:03:55,728\n>> [LAUGH] > The first command\nis www.google.com [LAUGH]\n\n1361\n01:03:55,728 --> 01:04:00,229\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1362\n01:04:00,229 --> 01:04:02,432\n>> All right, so we've got netsh,\n\n1363\n01:04:02,432 --> 01:04:04,770\nnat client, show state.\n\n1364\n01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:07,760\nRight, so show me what state we're in.\n\n1365\n01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,077\nSo it spits some of\nthe stuff out right here.\n\n1366\n01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:17,330\nAnd we can dig through and\nsee what's being pushed out.\n\n1367\n01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:23,685\nNow, as far how NAP is being enforced,\nwe do have a couple of ways.\n\n1368\n01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:26,873\nDHCP, so we can enforce it by DHCP.\n\n1369\n01:04:26,873 --> 01:04:32,860\nAnd the next one down so DCB is set to\nyes and is being enforced that way.\n\n1370\n01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,350\nWe can enforce it through an IP SACK,\nremote desktop gateway.\n\n1371\n01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:38,140\nAll the stuff here is set to no.\n\n1372\n01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:42,150\nYou may say well, okay, well what\naspect of it is it being pushed out.\n\n1373\n01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,240\nSo we're gonna see that right there.\n\n1374\n01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,720\nMm.\nAnd there is another one.\n\n1375\n01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,142\nInstead of show state, show config.\n\n1376\n01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:55,370\nOnce again, same kind of things,\nwe can see what is being enabled.\n\n1377\n01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:56,100\nOr disabled.\n\n1378\n01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:03,482\nAnd then there is also,\nit's another little tool that we can use.\n\n1379\n01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:11,478\n[NOISE] Napclientconfig.msc.\n\n1380\n01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:13,709\nAll right so this right here is a,\n\n1381\n01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:17,634\nthis little configuration tool\nthat is runs client side.\n\n1382\n01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:20,075\nOops [LAUGH].\n\n1383\n01:05:20,075 --> 01:05:22,180\nI'll just get back this guy.\n\n1384\n01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,040\nStretch it out a little bit.\n\n1385\n01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,910\nAnd here we can make some changes.\n\n1386\n01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:30,290\nIf it wasn't being enforced by policy.\n\n1387\n01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:34,630\nI mean you see some things in\nhere in the enforcement clients.\n\n1388\n01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,680\nThese are those different things so\nwe saw in the command line.\n\n1389\n01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,780\nSo which ways is NAT being pushed out?\n\n1390\n01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:46,420\nWhen you see that just the DHCP\none is being utilized so\n\n1391\n01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,700\nwhenever this machine goes and reaches for\n\n1392\n01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:53,230\nthat DHCP address, it makes sure that\nthis guy here is communicating properly.\n\n1393\n01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:56,400\nAnd then there's all\nthose other ones there.\n\n1394\n01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,640\nAnd interface settings, so\nthat that little pop up that we got.\n\n1395\n01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,382\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That showed we weren't here.\n\n1396\n01:06:01,382 --> 01:06:06,340\nWe can modify that and\nput little pictures or custom text.\n\n1397\n01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:11,940\nAnd those sorts of things in there on\nthe health registration settings here.\n\n1398\n01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,217\nWhich of course on the clients side I\ndon't have anything configured here.\n\n1399\n01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:20,020\n>> Yeah, there's a lot to it you know for\nthe most part though,\n\n1400\n01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:22,470\nthe dream of NAP, right?\n\n1401\n01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:25,155\nThat we try and achieve is where\nit's all pushed out by policy.\n\n1402\n01:06:25,155 --> 01:06:25,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n1403\n01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,310\nthere's not a whole lot of room for error.\n\n1404\n01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,140\nI think pretty much the things\nthat Nate showed originally.\n\n1405\n01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:33,890\nThe making sure that service is started\nand making sure that you're in compliance.\n\n1406\n01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,420\nThose are things that we need to do.\n\n1407\n01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:38,000\nOn the server side, there's a ton of\nthings that can go wrong, though, so\n\n1408\n01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,900\nif you wanna see more of that,\n\n1409\n01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,480\ndefinitely jump over and check out the\n7410 show where we set up, or 7411 show.\n\n1410\n01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,375\n>> Yep, Nap is 411.\n\n1411\n01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,548\n>> 411, 7411 show.\n\n1412\n01:06:45,548 --> 01:06:48,479\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> One of the Windows server 2012 R2 shows\n\n1413\n01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:50,240\nand we show up how to set up NAP.\n\n1414\n01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,560\nBecause there's like five\ndifferent ways to set it up.\n\n1415\n01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,870\nEach one tailored to a different need or\n\n1416\n01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:58,380\nwhatever so\ndefinitely something worth checking out.\n\n1417\n01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,345\nIt's neat stuff, it really is.\n\n1418\n01:07:00,345 --> 01:07:02,970\nAlright so Nate I think that\npretty much raps this up.\n\n1419\n01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:06,440\nAs far as we did VPN's,\nwe did RDP and we did NAP and\n\n1420\n01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,070\nthat's pretty much, now are remote\nservices that we need to be aware of,\n\n1421\n01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:14,185\nas far as trouble shooting and\nmaintaining those, that's pretty much it.\n\n1422\n01:07:14,185 --> 01:07:16,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Anything else to throw in?\n\n1423\n01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:18,192\n>> No, that's it.\n\n1424\n01:07:18,192 --> 01:07:18,950\nOf course,\n\n1425\n01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:22,730\nall the stock fell off the back end and\nthere's a lot of things on the backside.\n\n1426\n01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:25,950\nAnd as you mention,\nthere's a lot more interested and\n\n1427\n01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:29,270\njump into those other shows, and,\nyeah, check out the nitty gritty,\n\n1428\n01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:32,080\nset the stuff up in a home lab and\nmess around with it.\n\n1429\n01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,530\n>> Yeah, that's really where\nyou have the fun, right?\n\n1430\n01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:34,410\nYou set it up in a lab.\n\n1431\n01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:37,911\nCuz that's where you truly get to see all\nthe things that can go wrong [LAUGH].\n\n1432\n01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:41,200\nAlright, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nhope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1433\n01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,920\nLet me just remind you, live, during

00:00:41,280\nI am Nathan Copeland\nhere with Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,320\n>> How are you doing today?\n\n5\n00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,310\n>> Pretty good Ronnie, how are

stories?\n\n11\n00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,570\n>> Yeah, no I was just gonna\nask you how it went with\n\n12\n00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,500\nthe catching up of your\nepisodes on TV last night.\n\n13\n00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,400\n>> Yeah, I was pretty sad.\n\n14\n00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,130\nI went over your house last night for\ndinner and\n\n15\n00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,800\nI was hoping that you would play\nthose Gilmore Girls all night long.\n\n16\n00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,940\nBut no, you didn't have them.\n\n17\n00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,551\n>> No, cuz I actually locked the door.\n\n18\n00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,940\nAnd [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n19\n00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,700\n>> Yeah too bad.\n\n20\n00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,300\n>> All right.\n\n21\n00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,500\n>> Maybe next time.\n\n22\n00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,020\n>> Possibly, possibly next time.\n\n23\n00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,620\nWe can actually go to your house and\n\n24\n00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,750\nwatch the Housewives of Some Other County\non the Planet that's out there.\n\n25\n00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,240\nI don't know.\n\n26\n00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,740\nWell we can try.\n>> Deal.\n\n27\n00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,680\n>> Deal.\n\n28\n00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,290\nNow today, we have our 7688 show.\n\n29\n00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,030\nThis is the one that is\nsupporting Windows 8.\n\n30\n00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,522\nOkay?\nSo as we continue to go on through here,\n\n31\n00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:46,210\nwe actually have several objectives\nthat we still need to cover.\n\n32\n00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,430\nAnd Nate, what are the objectives\nthat we are covering today?\n\n33\n00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,660\n>> All right, so the official objectives.\n\n34\n00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,086\n[SOUND] As we scroll on down the page.\n\n35\n00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:55,816\n>> Scroll down the page, yes.\n\n36\n00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:59,126\n>> And\n[SOUND] we get down here to number three.\n\n37\n00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:03,070\n3.3, Support Client Compliance.\n\n38\n00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,130\nClient compliance,\nsome great stuff with Windows Updates.\n\n39\n00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,990\nWe've got Client Security, so with our\nWindows Defender, and then down there at\n\n40\n00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:16,720\nthe end we've got some Internet Explorer\nstuff, and finally, group policy stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty exciting.\n\n42\n00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,800\n>> Yeah.\nNow, for\n\n43\n00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,210\nus here, remember that term client\ncan usually mean one of two things.\n\n44\n00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,410\nRight?\nThe actual user that's in place.\n\n45\n00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,590\nNow, we're not going to actually send Nate\nout there to actually put a wrestling\n\n46\n00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,810\nchokehold on somebody until\nthey actually do submit to him.\n\n47\n00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,630\nEven though he could do it, we know.\n\n48\n00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,600\n>> Would that fall under good\ncommunication and professionalism skills?\n\n49\n00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,550\n>> That would fall under bad communication\nand professionalism skills, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,750\n>> Oops.\n>> Now, that's not\n\n51\n00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,060\nwhat we're talking about, right,\nwhat we're talking about is ensuring that\n\n52\n00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,240\nthe computers that are connecting\ntogether, usually into a network here,\n\n53\n00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,031\nare actually coming underneath\nthe compliances that we need to.\n\n54\n00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:56,080\nSo a lot of the time we need to ensure\nthat our computers are getting updates,\n\n55\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,910\nwe need to actually put security settings\non our particular computers as well.\n\n56\n00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,830\nOkay, we need to actually be able to\ndo the anti-intrusion types of things.\n\n57\n00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,030\nIn other words, take,\nmake, and look, take and\n\n58\n00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,100\nlook, excuse me, at the idea of Windows\nDefender and what it can do for us and\n\n59\n00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,690\nmaking sure that it's running, as well as\nactually supporting not only users inside\n\n60\n00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,520\nof our network, but even users that\nare connecting in with their BYODs,\n\n61\n00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,850\nthey're bring your own devices,\nas they actually do connect in as well.\n\n62\n00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,250\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nall those different settings.\n\n63\n00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,310\nAnd then lastly,\n\n64\n00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,460\nwhich is probably gonna take up\nthe majority of what we're gonna do.\n\n65\n00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,950\nIs we're gonna talk a little\nbit about group policy and\n\n66\n00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,060\nhow that really does affect us.\n\n67\n00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,520\nAnd how incredibly it can\naffect an individual machine,\n\n68\n00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,487\nas well as multiple\nmachines at the same time.\n\n69\n00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,075\nYeah.\n\n70\n00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:42,960\n>> Yep.\nAll right,\n\n71\n00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,090\nRonnie, what do you say we\njust kick this thing off and\n\n72\n00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,700\nwe just jump right into Windows Updates?\n\n73\n00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,480\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n74\n00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,130\n>> Sound good?\n\n75\n00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,110\n>> Sounds good.\n\n76\n00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,080\nOkay.\n\n77\n00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,650\nYeah.\n\n78\n00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,830\n>> All right.\nNow, in terms of Windows Updates, right?\n\n79\n00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,950\nFor us, operating systems\nhave to be updated, okay,\n\n80\n00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,350\nno matter what we actually say.\n\n81\n00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,340\nI remember at one time it use\nto be this kind of school of\n\n82\n00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,590\nthought back in the days of Windows 95 and\n98, some of the updates actually said\n\n83\n00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,822\ndon't apply this update unless you're\nalready experiencing these problems.\n\n84\n00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,150\nOkay?\nSo it used to be that way.\n\n85\n00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,590\nBut today Microsoft has\npretty much put out there\n\n86\n00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,294\nthat by default when you install\nWindows 8.1 on your machine,\n\n87\n00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,110\nit's going to go ahead and set up what\nwe call Automatic Updates for us.\n\n88\n00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,940\nAnd that allows for us to actually\nbe able to contact Microsoft\n\n89\n00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,000\nautomatically in the background and\nthe machine can update.\n\n90\n00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,970\nUsually it updates during times when we're\nnot really using the actual machine.\n\n91\n00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,860\nAnd normally it's about 3 A.M. local time.\n\n92\n00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,260\nOkay, when we start taking\na look at that idea.\n\n93\n00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,477\nNow, the majority of updates that they do\npush out not only help us to fix things,\n\n94\n00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:48,160\na lot of them are also the idea\nof security updates as well.\n\n95\n00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,660\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look\nat the idea of the Windows Update\n\n96\n00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,593\nas it comes default on Windows 8.1.\n\n97\n00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:59,340\nDo I have it or do you have it?\n\n98\n00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,940\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n99\n00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,470\nLet me pull up some Windows Updates here.\n\n100\n00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,456\nAnd to get to our Windows Updates\nwe go in through [SOUND],\n\n101\n00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:14,198\nlet's see, there's always more\nthan one way to get to things.\n\n102\n00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:16,718\nWe're going to go open\nup our File Explorer.\n\n103\n00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:21,084\nWe go into our Properties and\ninto our System Properties,\n\n104\n00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:26,710\nwhich is just one of many ways,\ndown there at the bottom, Windows Update.\n\n105\n00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,730\nAll right, so now we are here\nat our Windows Update screen,\n\n106\n00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,820\nand we can see I am up to\nmy client compliance here,\n\n107\n00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,885\non this machine here,\nthat no updates are available.\n\n108\n00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:42,600\nWell now, the machine here will reach out.\n\n109\n00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,320\nThere's a frequency setting\nthat every what is it like,\n\n110\n00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,120\nevery 22 hours it will reach out and\ncheck for new updates and\n\n111\n00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,397\nit says the most recent check\nwas today at 8:50 right.\n\n112\n00:05:53,397 --> 00:05:56,272\nAll right, yeah that's well\nthat wasn't too long ago yeah.\n\n113\n00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,770\nAll right, so we can just go ahead and\nclick on the Check for updates over there,\n\n114\n00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,860\non the left hand side.\n\n115\n00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,490\nAnd sure enough, we are all good.\n\n116\n00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,270\nMost recent check now is at 9:08 AM.\n\n117\n00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,220\n>> Yeah.\n\n118\n00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,710\nNow, even though these\nare the default settings,\n\n119\n00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,730\na lot of times these can be changed,\n\n120\n00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,610\ndepending on what is required through\nthe security policy of your organization,\n\n121\n00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,840\nor whatever other policies we have to\nensure the idea of compliance here, right?\n\n122\n00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,670\nSo we wanna make sure that machines\nthat are plugged into our network\n\n123\n00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,150\nare actually getting updates.\n\n124\n00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,260\nAnd not only can we reach out\nto Microsoft directly to it, but\n\n125\n00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,110\nthen there are other things\nthat can actually affect this.\n\n126\n00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,310\nAnd we'll see that later on\nin terms of group policy.\n\n127\n00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,090\nBut Nate, let's go here on the left hand\nside and actually click on some of those\n\n128\n00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,840\nlinks over there such as the idea of\nchanging the settings over here, yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,320\n>> All right, yeah.\n\n130\n00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,760\nSo here we go.\n\n131\n00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,925\nSo, we can change some,\nactually, not many of these.\n\n132\n00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:46,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not many of these settings at all.\n\n133\n00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,810\nUp there at the yellow banner\nit says some setting are manage\n\n134\n00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,950\nby your system administrator.\n\n135\n00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,440\nNow Ronnie, so take a wild guess,\n\n136\n00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,580\nso why am I not able to change\nsome of these settings?\n\n137\n00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,060\n>> Well it says that your system\nadministrator is controlling some of these\n\n138\n00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,870\nand that probably means that there is\nsomething else affecting the updates.\n\n139\n00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,820\n>> Yeah, now on this machine right here,\nso you know Ronnie and I we have,\n\n140\n00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,900\nwe'll be talking about in\ntune here in a minute.\n\n141\n00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,680\nThis machine here is part\nof the Windows In Tune.\n\n142\n00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,150\nThe little client that's on\nthis machine here running and\n\n143\n00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,610\nis now tying me to Windows In Tune.\n\n144\n00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,750\nAnd so\nthat I believe is what is tying this up.\n\n145\n00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,150\nIt would be managed in\nthrough Windows In Tune.\n\n146\n00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,040\n>> Yep.\n\n147\n00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,610\n>> Now let's see, so\n>> Yeah, go ahead.\n\n148\n00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,042\n>> Yeah, yeah, let's see [SOUND].\n\n149\n00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:36,920\n>> Now, on some of those settings, right,\nif yes, you did have command of it.\n\n150\n00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,550\nAnd my machine is going\na little bit nuts here, or\n\n151\n00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,230\nI would be able to pull up\nwhat I was trying to show you.\n\n152\n00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,360\nLet's see if we can do it here.\n\n153\n00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,932\nOkay.\nNotice in going through the charms bar and\n\n154\n00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:54,656\nthen selecting the PC settings over here,\nI was able to go into Update and Recovery.\n\n155\n00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:57,927\nAnd then, into the Windows Updates here.\n\n156\n00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:02,397\nSo, this is also another place that you\ncan see it as an individual computer.\n\n157\n00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:06,665\nAnd then you can also see\nchoose how to get updates.\n\n158\n00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:09,465\nWhich is this link right here.\n\n159\n00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:12,650\nOkay?\nIf I select that link notice that mine is\n\n160\n00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,820\nnot controlled by anybody else.\n\n161\n00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,130\nAnd that means that this\nmachine is a stand alone.\n\n162\n00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,680\nNow we will actually encounter both\ninside of our support window, right?\n\n163\n00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,480\nSo we will encounter machines that will\nalready have settings made for us and\n\n164\n00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,760\nwe can't change them as you\nsaw over on Nate's computer.\n\n165\n00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,670\nOn mine, this is an individual\nstand alone computer.\n\n166\n00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,370\nIt's not joined to note, it's not\nbeing controlled by Windows Intune.\n\n167\n00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,420\nNotice I have the recommended\nsettings here turned on\n\n168\n00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,980\nwhich is to automatically update.\n\n169\n00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,240\nWhich means it goes out to Microsoft and\ndoes that.\n\n170\n00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,650\nI can download but\nchose when to actually install them.\n\n171\n00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,600\nI can check for updates and then choose\nwhether or not to install them as well.\n\n172\n00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,080\nNow in those settings here,\nnot as important anymore.\n\n173\n00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,290\nAt one time, when hard drives were small,\n\n174\n00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,910\nupdates could actually\noverwhelm this machine.\n\n175\n00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,830\nNow yesterday I brought up a Windows\n7 machine, and I just installed and\n\n176\n00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,770\nI brought it up and it had 133 updates and\nthat's something like 400 megabytes.\n\n177\n00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,910\nToday we go well what's the big\ndeal 400 megabytes, but\n\n178\n00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,610\nin the days when we had like\n10 gigabyte hard drives or\n\n179\n00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,340\neven smaller it actually\ncould make a difference here.\n\n180\n00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,140\nYou might actually chose to check for\nupdates, and\n\n181\n00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,030\nthen actually chose which one's you wanted\nto install or not install all of them, or\n\n182\n00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,430\ndownload them and not install them.\n\n183\n00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,700\nAnd that way you could pick and\nchose from a list.\n\n184\n00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,870\nOr of course the one they'd never want\nyou to actually be able to do here.\n\n185\n00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,945\nIs to never check for updates at all.\n\n186\n00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:34,770\nOkay.\n\n187\n00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,930\nNow if your machine is not\nconnecting internet and\n\n188\n00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,770\nyou're not bringing any foreign\ndrives onto your machine.\n\n189\n00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,430\nNo big deal, you can do that.\n\n190\n00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,050\nBut usually you wanna at least update the\nmachine here is as what you want to do.\n\n191\n00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,460\nOkay?\n\n192\n00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,770\nSo, there's not only these types of\nupdates here, but remember every Windows 7\n\n193\n00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,210\nmachine we can actually use those\nsettings to actually help us out.\n\n194\n00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,910\nAs well, okay?\n\n195\n00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,220\n>> All right so a few more things.\n\n196\n00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,730\nSo I did log into a virtual machine\nthat we have up here and running.\n\n197\n00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,600\nAll right so one important update,\nit says right here, is available.\n\n198\n00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,100\nAnd now we'll click on change settings.\n\n199\n00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,770\nUnlike mine, so it's not being managed.\n\n200\n00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,290\nNow we can change some of these things.\n\n201\n00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,470\nNow up here in the important\nupdates section, so\n\n202\n00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,000\nsimilar to what Ronnie's menu\nwas we have the options, right?\n\n203\n00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,630\nInstall updates automatically.\n\n204\n00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,400\nIt is recommended there by Microsoft.\n\n205\n00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,110\nAnd, download them and\nchoose whether to install them or not.\n\n206\n00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,450\nYep, checking for the updates and\nthen never check.\n\n207\n00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,590\nNow, there are some things\nthat we can change in here for\n\n208\n00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,770\nthe recommended updates.\n\n209\n00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,390\nSo, we have the important updates,\nthe criticals, in sorts of things, and\n\n210\n00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,400\nthen the recommended updates.\n\n211\n00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,440\nWhich aren't as critical as some\nof these security settings,\n\n212\n00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,460\nthe definition updates and\nthose sorts of things.\n\n213\n00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,720\nWe can choose to install them the same way\nas the important updates there at that\n\n214\n00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,460\ncheck box there.\n\n215\n00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,010\nNow, let's see, we click on back one.\n\n216\n00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,000\nNow, Ryan, so let's say there's\na particular update that has gone out.\n\n217\n00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,530\nAnd your administrator says hey,\nmake sure that you've got update blank.\n\n218\n00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,570\nYou know, KB yadda yadda yadda blah.\n\n219\n00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,110\nAll right, now, what would you?\n\n220\n00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,460\nHow would you know if you did\nreceive an update or not?\n\n221\n00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n222\n00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,510\nWell, you'd got to have actually go and\nview your picker update history here.\n\n223\n00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,920\nSo over on the left hand side you\nwould actually select that option.\n\n224\n00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,880\nAnd then you could go and actually search\nand see if the update's actually there.\n\n225\n00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,942\nAnd notice suggest you don't\n\n226\n00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:33,250\nhave the option to actually\nview all the installments.\n\n227\n00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,724\nBut notice the three or\nfour different columns that we have here.\n\n228\n00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,120\nRight.\nThe name of the update.\n\n229\n00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,060\nSo we could look for that particular\nknowledge base number that we wanted to,\n\n230\n00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,140\nthe way Nate described it, and I can see\nwhether it actually succeeded or failed.\n\n231\n00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,210\nNow on my computer I've actually had\nsome that said failed before and it's\n\n232\n00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,120\njust telling you that this update did not\nactually succeed in the way it wanted to.\n\n233\n00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,690\nAnd notice it does give you\na level of importance as well, and\n\n234\n00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,090\nthen you actually have\nthe time that it installed.\n\n235\n00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,900\nA lot of times inside of a business,\nright, that you have.\n\n236\n00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,835\nYou might actually have what we call\na Windows services update server.\n\n237\n00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:05,090\nOkay?\n\n238\n00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,470\nWSUS server, and\n\n239\n00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,710\nthat's the one that actually gets\nall the updates from Microsoft.\n\n240\n00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,410\nAnd then your particular client's\ncomputers can point to that one machine,\n\n241\n00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,610\nand they can dole out the updates,\nthe ones that we actually choose to.\n\n242\n00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,780\nAnd that might be a better way to control\nit if we only wanted certain updates to\n\n243\n00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,370\nactually come through, and not to flood\nlike we what we have here, at times.\n\n244\n00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n245\n00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,430\nNow, let's say that there is a particular\nupdate That we don't want anymore.\n\n246\n00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,460\nLet's say it's causing\nsome kind of problem or\n\n247\n00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,620\nit's conflicting with\nsome other application.\n\n248\n00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,640\nNow, Ronnie, true story.\n\n249\n00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,402\n>> All right.\n\n250\n00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:41,090\n>> All right.\nSo, here at our place there was\n\n251\n00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,030\na particular machine, and it required\na certain version of Internet Explorer.\n\n252\n00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,530\n>> Right.\n>> It was like, Internet Explorer 8 or\n\n253\n00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,900\nsomething like that.\n\n254\n00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,570\nWell, through the Windows updates\nit automatically downloaded and\n\n255\n00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,350\ninstalled Windows Explorer 10.\n\n256\n00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,828\nWell, this application that was running,\nit broke.\n\n257\n00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:59,750\n>> Right. It failed.\n>> And it ceased to work.\n\n258\n00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,470\nAnd through the trial and error, [COUGH]\nwe were able to figure out that it was\n\n259\n00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,650\nthe version of Explorer had been\nupdated and it broke the application.\n\n260\n00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,589\nWell, let's say that we had to\nremove that Internet Explorer.\n\n261\n00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:16,040\nWe had to roll back that update and\ngo back.\n\n262\n00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,780\nNow, of course Internet Explorer.\n\n263\n00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,600\nAs any other kind of update.\n\n264\n00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,840\nSo through this review\nyour update history.\n\n265\n00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,340\nWe can't roll back updates,\nor uninstall updates.\n\n266\n00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,060\nSo up there's a little link\nthat we can click on that and\n\n267\n00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,930\nup there at the top, uninstall an update.\n\n268\n00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,380\nWe can click through the stuff and\nlook for\n\n269\n00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,030\nany kinds of things when they see fit and\nwe can click on and\n\n270\n00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:50,375\nwe can uninstall these updates.\n\n271\n00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,868\nSo, there you go.\n\n272\n00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:56,590\n>> Yeah,\nuninstalling update is an actual viable\n\n273\n00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,270\nmeans of actually getting\nthings functioning again.\n\n274\n00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,070\nBut remember even after this you\nwanna do a little bit of research and\n\n275\n00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,790\nactually figure out why this end it's off.\n\n276\n00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,690\nEspecially if it says\nsecurity update right, and\n\n277\n00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,810\nthat broke your picker application.\n\n278\n00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,310\nUsually it's not gonna be that, but\nif it is, you wanna figure out why because\n\n279\n00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,320\nusually security updates are actually\nan important thing for us.\n\n280\n00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,040\nAnd the reason why I wanna update is\nto actually improve the security and\n\n281\n00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,400\nactually insure the idea of compliance for\nus.\n\n282\n00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,070\nThat is does meet our policies,\nthat we do have in place.\n\n283\n00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,670\nNow, because we have so many different\ncontrols here on an individual computer.\n\n284\n00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,130\nThis also means that if you show\nan end user how to do this,\n\n285\n00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,020\nthey could actually change it.\n\n286\n00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,830\nOkay?\nIn other words,\n\n287\n00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,150\nthey can modify those original defaults.\n\n288\n00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,510\nInstead of saying,\ndo automatic updates all the time,\n\n289\n00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,650\nthey could actually choose that not\nrecommended setting, and then turn it off.\n\n290\n00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,440\nAnd now you have a machine\ninside of your network.\n\n291\n00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,860\nAnd now its getting no updates at all,\nand now it becomes a possible or what we\n\n292\n00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,000\nwould call a threat or a vulnerability for\nus inside our network here, okay?\n\n293\n00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,368\nSo, some of the other\nthings that we can do,\n\n294\n00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:03,570\nis that we can actually\nlock these settings down.\n\n295\n00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,210\nBy using what we call the local\ngroup policy under it, right?\n\n296\n00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,510\n>> Yeah and now there are a number of\na local group policy settings that the do\n\n297\n00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,670\npertain to windows update and\n\n298\n00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,070\njust like Rye said we can use\nthose to lockdown these machines.\n\n299\n00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,060\nAnd make sure that,\nwhat we want as far as the updates go and\n\n300\n00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,010\nhow they're handled,\nthat we have control over that.\n\n301\n00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,860\nRight?\n\n302\n00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,140\n>> Should we get in there and\ntake a look at some of them?\n\n303\n00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,660\n>> Yeah,\nwe do wanna actually make sure that you\n\n304\n00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,570\nget in here because this is one of\nthe important topics on the exam as well,\n\n305\n00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,060\nis that they want you to be familiar\nwith at least the local root policy.\n\n306\n00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,060\nAnd we also wanna have at least\na basic understanding of using\n\n307\n00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,080\nthe active directory group policy as well.\n\n308\n00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,110\nSo this is the best place to get\nyour feet wet on this, okay?\n\n309\n00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,320\nYep, let's do it.\n\n310\n00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,150\n>> All right, so we'll close this out and\n\n311\n00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,550\nwe'll get into our local\ngroup of policies.\n\n312\n00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,328\nSo we'll go into Gpedit.msc.\n\n313\n00:15:53,328 --> 00:16:00,601\nGive this guy a minute here to fire up,\nwhile it grinds away.\n\n314\n00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:04,420\nAnd maximize this.\n\n315\n00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:14,060\nAll right, and then under\nthe computer configuration, right?\n\n316\n00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,440\nAnd actually we don't have any\nof the policy settings, but\n\n317\n00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,295\nwe'll go in through administrative\ntemplates and Windows components.\n\n318\n00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:29,264\nAnd we'll scroll right on\ndown to Windows update.\n\n319\n00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:37,576\nAll right, so a few items in\nhere that we can take note as.\n\n320\n00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:40,907\nNow this one right here\nI think is pretty neat.\n\n321\n00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:44,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I double-click on that as it opens up,\n\n322\n00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,160\nI'm enabling\nWindows Update Power Management to\n\n323\n00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,380\nautomatically wake the system.\n\n324\n00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,570\nNow let's say you have a machine\nas it sits in hibernation state.\n\n325\n00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,209\nBy enabling this policy,\nthe system, the Windows Update,\n\n326\n00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:04,620\nit can wake up the system and apply these\nupdates, and then put it back to sleep.\n\n327\n00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,800\nNow, you may think,\nwell what about battery power?\n\n328\n00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,610\nBut what about if it's on a laptop,\nsitting tucked away,\n\n329\n00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,490\nhibernating in your little bag?\n\n330\n00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,080\nI mean,\nthat would really kill the battery.\n\n331\n00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,670\n>> It would.\n>> If one of those updates senses that it\n\n332\n00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,690\nis on battery power,\nit won't apply any updates.\n\n333\n00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,550\nIt'll just put itself in suspend, and\n\n334\n00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,380\nthen after two minutes, the machine\nwill go back into its hibernation state.\n\n335\n00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,980\n>> That is a pretty neat setting, yeah.\n\n336\n00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,787\n>> And let's see.\n\n337\n00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:31,989\nYeah, how about that one right there?\n\n338\n00:17:31,989 --> 00:17:35,090\nConfigure automatic updates.\n\n339\n00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so it's right here, right?\n\n340\n00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,600\nYeah, goodness sakes.\n\n341\n00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,455\nConfiguring the automatic updates,\nwe enable this guy.\n\n342\n00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:47,300\nAnd we can set which of those settings\nthat we were looking at earlier\n\n343\n00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,435\nwill then take effect, right?\n\n344\n00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,990\nSo notify for download, notify for\n\n345\n00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,095\ninstall, automatically download and\ninstall.\n\n346\n00:17:55,095 --> 00:18:00,421\nOr down here at this last one, allow the\nlocal admin to choose the setting, right?\n\n347\n00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:05,150\nSo we can choose that one as well, and\nafter we pick one, we say notify for\n\n348\n00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,880\ndownload, notify for Install.\n\n349\n00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,250\nNow if it is going to install, Windows 8\nwill go through these maintenance periods,\n\n350\n00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,580\na scheduled maintenance period or\nwhenever the computer is not being used.\n\n351\n00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,540\nSo when it senses an idle time,\nthen Windows 8.1, it'll go and\n\n352\n00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,980\njust do some maintenance\ntest in the background, and\n\n353\n00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,912\nwe can also use that maintenance\ntime to install these updates.\n\n354\n00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:29,720\n>> All right.\n\n355\n00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,565\n>> And we can set the schedule,\nby default it is everyday at 3 AM.\n\n356\n00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:39,940\n>> Yep, and this gives us the ability\nagain to lock it down, right?\n\n357\n00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,570\nSo that we actually do allow,\nlike we said, either the auto update, or\n\n358\n00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:49,530\nallow local admin to choose the setting\nlike we have here to be able to do that.\n\n359\n00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,470\nThat actually can do that if\nsomebody else is using the computer.\n\n360\n00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,610\nThey probably won't be able to choose or\nchange the settings here.\n\n361\n00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,560\nSo this is another place where we'll\nactually add in more control, or\n\n362\n00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,780\nwe can enforce the compliance\non the computer as well.\n\n363\n00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,800\n>> All right, let's see, where's,\nright here is a good one.\n\n364\n00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,535\nAll right, we enable this one, right?\n\n365\n00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,880\n>> Yep.\n>> The detection frequency,\n\n366\n00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,139\nhow often it goes out and\nit checks for any of those updates.\n\n367\n00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:19,305\nAnd sure enough, so\nby default the interval here is 22 hours,\n\n368\n00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:22,682\nit'll go out and reach for new updates.\n\n369\n00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:26,923\nNow Ronnie, so\nyou mention the WSUS, right?\n\n370\n00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:29,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The Windows Server Update Services,\n\n371\n00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,500\nand they have four controlling updates.\n\n372\n00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,600\nNow with that it's a central\nlocation inside your network, or\n\n373\n00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,970\nthe server will go and download updates.\n\n374\n00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,550\nWell, I guess there's a lot of setting\non there exactly how it handles it.\n\n375\n00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,080\n>> Right.\n\n376\n00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,320\n>> But it'll go and it will get all\nthe updates where you can approve, deny,\n\n377\n00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,225\nyou can roll updates to certain groups\nbased on whatever rules that you set up.\n\n378\n00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:55,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well, that central place right,\n\n379\n00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,250\ndemands all your updates.\n\n380\n00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,100\nThis setting right up there,\n\n381\n00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,120\nspecify intranet\nMicrosoft Update Service Location.\n\n382\n00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,255\nIf we enable this one,\nthen in this field here,\n\n383\n00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:10,365\nthat we would specify\nwhere that server is.\n\n384\n00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:12,625\nSo we would tell our systems here,\n\n385\n00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,000\ndon't go out to Microsoft Update\nout there on the internet.\n\n386\n00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,685\n>> Right.\n\n387\n00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:21,255\n>> Go to our internal WSUS server for\nour updates.\n\n388\n00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,910\nAnd so we'll just put in like, HTTP,\n\n389\n00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,925\nI think our little domain controller is.\n\n390\n00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:35,172\nLet's see, gosh,\n\n391\n00:20:35,172 --> 00:20:41,139\nitprotvdc2.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n392\n00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:44,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And of course there's a port setting.\n\n393\n00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,000\nDo you remember what the default port is?\n\n394\n00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,370\n>> I do not.\n\n395\n00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,331\n>> It's like 8335 something.\n\n396\n00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:54,120\n[LAUGH] No, that's way too many.\n\n397\n00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,290\n>> Yeah, and usually just setting up the\nactual site here is pretty much the key.\n\n398\n00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,396\nNotice they even have a statistical\nserver site that you can again generate\n\n399\n00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:07,200\nthe statistics of it, you can send the\ninformation back to that server as well.\n\n400\n00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,260\nSo in large business you may have this,\nwhere they go and\n\n401\n00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,590\nthey test all the updates first before\nthey're pushed out the the machines here.\n\n402\n00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,050\nAnd so, here's a setting that you can also\ndo on the individual machine to tell it,\n\n403\n00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,480\nhey go and check that machine.\n\n404\n00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,240\nNow, usually if you actually\ndo have that large number,\n\n405\n00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,970\nyou're no gonna actually be\nsetting this setting here.\n\n406\n00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,930\nThat's gonna push down from what we call\nActive Directory group policy instead.\n\n407\n00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,230\nBut, here's one way you\ncan do it manually,\n\n408\n00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,689\nif you wanted your machine to\ngo to a different location.\n\n409\n00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,930\n>> All right, and yeah, so\nthere's a number of other settings here.\n\n410\n00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,950\nBut yeah, those are some, I think,\nthat are worth calling out.\n\n411\n00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,970\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n412\n00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,790\nEspecially in this one, right?\n\n413\n00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,050\nIn this one, in terms of support,\nyou want to make sure that your machines\n\n414\n00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,690\nare getting the actual proper place where\nthey're getting their updates from.\n\n415\n00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,317\nAnd so a lot of times, you might actually\neven see these ones that we at least\n\n416\n00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:02,500\nshowed you,\nyou're gonna probably see again.\n\n417\n00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,391\n>> Alright so, these items right here, so\n\n418\n00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:10,760\nfar what we've talked about is the Windows\nupdates on our client machine.\n\n419\n00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,990\nNow, we just talked briefly\nabout Windows Intune.\n\n420\n00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,210\nNow, with Windows Intune we can also\nmanaged client updates as well.\n\n421\n00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,460\n>> Right.\n\n422\n00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,132\n>> And so lets jump over and\ntake a gander at that\n\n423\n00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:24,410\n>> Now that remember for\n\n424\n00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,170\nus Windows Intune is\na Clouds Management Service, okay?\n\n425\n00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,230\nSo we don't have to have any\ninfrastructure on my business here.\n\n426\n00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,770\nIt's all hosted by Microsoft itself, and\n\n427\n00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:42,040\nnow if we actually have the Microsoft\nclient installed on the computer, okay.\n\n428\n00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,570\nWhat we can actually tell it to do then,\n\n429\n00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,390\nis that it connects to that\nWindows Intune site, and from there\n\n430\n00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,340\nwe can push out the updates, regardless\nof what the user actually wants.\n\n431\n00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,210\nAnd this is what they saw on Nate's\ncomputer a little bit earlier.\n\n432\n00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,950\nHe has the Windows Intune client\ninstalled on his computer, and\n\n433\n00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,410\nnow from Intune, he can actually control\nwhat bays are actually pushed out in that.\n\n434\n00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,080\nThe advantage of Intune,\n\n435\n00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,560\nthis is true regardless of whether Nate's\ncomputer is a member of my network,\n\n436\n00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,960\nor whether Nate's computer is not\na member of my network as well.\n\n437\n00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,680\nIf he is connected up to Intune and\n\n438\n00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,360\nusing that client, then he's gonna\nbe controlled by it as well.\n\n439\n00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,410\nOh, look at there.\n\n440\n00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n441\n00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,030\n>> Yeah.\n\n442\n00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,865\n>> Yeah, there it goes, installing up.\n\n443\n00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,720\n>> Yeah, now while Nate's computer is\nactually installing and he's trying to get\n\n444\n00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,590\naccess to the admin portal, I think\nis what he's trying to get access to.\n\n445\n00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:40,510\nLet's see, what we can do to\nat least get to this point,\n\n446\n00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,370\nand then we'll hand it back\nover to Nate here, okay?\n\n447\n00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,370\nSo I want to ask you to get over\nto the home page, or did I go to?\n\n448\n00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,740\nNo, that's right, okay?\n\n449\n00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:54,635\nSo I'm gonna log in as me at this point,\nif I can remember.\n\n450\n00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:59,293\nNow don't forget that you actually have\nthe ability to go to Windows Intune now,\n\n451\n00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:00,114\nand sign up for\n\n452\n00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:04,244\na 30 day trial account So that you\ncan test these settings out as well.\n\n453\n00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:04,996\nOkay?\n\n454\n00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:11,260\nIf I can spell Microsoft.com.\n\n455\n00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:14,090\n>> Hooray.\n\n456\n00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,790\nI win.\n\n457\n00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,798\n>> You win.\nYeah.\n\n458\n00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:16,993\nExcellent.\n\n459\n00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,350\n>> All right.\n\n460\n00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,650\nSo okay, so we got this Silverlight\ninstalled here on my machine and\n\n461\n00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,190\nwe are up and running.\n\n462\n00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,870\nNow, so to go to our place where\nwe can manage these updates,\n\n463\n00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,170\nover on the left hand side we\nhave the little button here.\n\n464\n00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,660\nUpdates.\n\n465\n00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,440\nWe can click on all updates here.\n\n466\n00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,360\nNow, the way that updates are handled\nthrough In Tune is a lot like\n\n467\n00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,630\nthe Windows Server update services,\nit's the way that we set classifications,\n\n468\n00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,380\nand we can set automatic approval rules,\n\n469\n00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,730\nand how we can approve or\ndeny certain updates, and rule them out.\n\n470\n00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,623\nTo certain computer groups\nthat's a lot like WSUS.\n\n471\n00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:07,600\nSo, the first thing we have are these\nlittle overview panel here.\n\n472\n00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,770\nIt's like somebody is not\ntaking their updates.\n\n473\n00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,600\nThree new updates to approve.\n\n474\n00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,870\nLet's just click on this and\nsee what we've got here.\n\n475\n00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,740\nUpdate for that.\n\n476\n00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,430\nUpdate for that.\n\n477\n00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,486\nBrowser choice screen update.\n\n478\n00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,511\nShould we [INAUDIBLE].\n\n479\n00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:23,330\n>> Mm.\nInteresting.\n\n480\n00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,925\n>> Yeah, let's just approve that one.\n\n481\n00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,050\n>> [LAUGH] Of course.\n\n482\n00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,840\n>> All right.\nWe'll approve that one and so\n\n483\n00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,770\nnow let's select who we\nare going to approve it for.\n\n484\n00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,650\nNow, we haven't really tested this,\nso let's definitely approve it for\n\n485\n00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,715\nall computers.\n\n486\n00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:38,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And for the approval level,\n\n487\n00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,210\nwe will say it is a required install.\n\n488\n00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,970\nAnd for a deadline,\n\n489\n00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,620\nnow there is the scheduled time that\nthe computers will install these updates.\n\n490\n00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,050\nNow, let's say some time passes\nit's off the network for\n\n491\n00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:58,880\nwhatever reason it gets up to a certain\ntime where it can set a deadline.\n\n492\n00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,540\nif you haven't installed this by such and\nsuch time.\n\n493\n00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,022\nNo matter what you have to schedule it and\ndo it.\n\n494\n00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,440\nSo that is for the deadline.\n\n495\n00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,980\nSo we'll just say a month.\n\n496\n00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,670\nSo in one month if it\ndoesn't do these updates.\n\n497\n00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,026\n>> So now, Nate just clicked on\nthrough that which is perfectly fine.\n\n498\n00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:19,363\nAt the bottom of that screen though,\n\n499\n00:26:19,363 --> 00:26:21,488\nIt told him something which\nhe probably should have read.\n\n500\n00:26:21,488 --> 00:26:22,960\nBut I don't know if he did or not.\n\n501\n00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,830\nWhich said hey, if you do this,\n\n502\n00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,080\nthis is one of these updates\nwhich can not be uninstalled.\n\n503\n00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,130\nSo just kind of be wary of stuff\nlike that as you go through.\n\n504\n00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,540\n>> All right there.\n\n505\n00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,970\nUpdate requirements.\n\n506\n00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,580\nThis update has update\ncan not be uninstalled.\n\n507\n00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,930\n>> Yeah, now you go why do we care?\n\n508\n00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,680\nWell once again, what if the update\ncauses some issue, like for\n\n509\n00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,890\nexample what Nate was talking\nabout here a little bit earlier.\n\n510\n00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,970\nThe update of Internet Explorer kind of\nhappened but we could roll that one back.\n\n511\n00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,710\nBut this update says what?\n\n512\n00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,800\nYou install it, you own it.\n\n513\n00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,060\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n514\n00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,740\n>> Well then let's\ndefinitely approve that one.\n\n515\n00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,370\n>> Absolutely.\n\n516\n00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,770\n>> It must be really important.\n\n517\n00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,270\n>> It's gotta be important.\n\n518\n00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,660\nAll right so I guess just for\ngood measures let's just click\n\n519\n00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,450\nthrough this last one here for\nall of our computers.\n\n520\n00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,070\nNow we didn't really set up any\nseparate computer groups at this time.\n\n521\n00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:22,284\nWe should just have two machines\nenrolled so we will approve that one\n\n522\n00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:27,600\nthat is going to be uninstalled,\nwe'll just set it up for two weeks.\n\n523\n00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,920\nNice.\nAll right.\n\n524\n00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,660\nSo, updates are scheduled.\n\n525\n00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,450\nThey are ready to essentially go out here.\n\n526\n00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,480\nAll right.\n\n527\n00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,960\nAnd your numbers changed\nup to 11 pending updates.\n\n528\n00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,830\nYeah, there you go, look at that.\n\n529\n00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,452\n>> Yup.\n11, 11 pending updates.\n\n530\n00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:46,650\nAll right, so now, up here, so\nhere's a little overview screen.\n\n531\n00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,910\nAnd down below we have all updates.\n\n532\n00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,760\nAnd click on all updates.\n\n533\n00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,360\nNow, these are all of the available\nupdates, across everything.\n\n534\n00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,560\nWell, I guess we'll see that\nacross certain classifications.\n\n535\n00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,470\nAnd there are many.\n\n536\n00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,905\nThousands upon thousands.\n\n537\n00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:05,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They scroll down.\n\n538\n00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,740\n>> A thousand plus, yeah.\n\n539\n00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,930\n>> It just blanks out,\nyeah, load them all up.\n\n540\n00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,970\nYeah many, many, many updates.\n\n541\n00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,040\nNow we don't really have\nto approve all of them.\n\n542\n00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,880\n>> Nope.\n>> There just kind of\n\n543\n00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,690\nsitting here waiting.\n\n544\n00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,420\nNow we can click over here and filter it\ndown, hopefully I don't click too fast and\n\n545\n00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,055\nhose it.\n\n546\n00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:24,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we can click on those and\n\n547\n00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,950\nfilter it down a little bit to\nview just the critical updates or\n\n548\n00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:32,370\njust the definition updates or\n>> The update service packs,\n\n549\n00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,270\nroll ups, mandatory, yep.\n\n550\n00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:39,380\n>> Now, so I did mention that we can\ncontrol which updates that we get to.\n\n551\n00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,450\nWe can set the automatic approval rules.\n\n552\n00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,280\n>> Right.\n>> And we can, but not from this.\n\n553\n00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:54,180\nSo down in the administration,\nwe'll click on updates, And so here we go.\n\n554\n00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,250\nSo now it says up here\nselect the product or\n\n555\n00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,920\ncategories of products for\nwhich you want to manage the updates.\n\n556\n00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,310\nSo let's see Ronnie.\n\n557\n00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,820\nLet's pick a couple.\n\n558\n00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,460\n>> All right.\n>> Which ones should we.\n\n559\n00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:09,490\n>> You could do that.\n\n560\n00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,390\nI don't know why you would.\n\n561\n00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,930\n>> Let's click on down here and find.\n\n562\n00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,680\nSo Office 2002,\nshould we get updates for that one?\n\n563\n00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,090\n>> Yeah, you should not.\n\n564\n00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,160\nSo whatever version of Office here,\nyou might want to check that one.\n\n565\n00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,380\n>> All right, we'll get Office 2013.\n\n566\n00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,910\n>> Oh, Skype!\n\n567\n00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,500\n>> Oh yeah, you want to do Skype?\n\n568\n00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,290\nAre you a big Skyper?\n\n569\n00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,170\n>> No, I'm not.\n\n570\n00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,080\n>> No.\nYeah.\n\n571\n00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,550\nIt doesn't work well over\nsatellite Internet connection.\n\n572\n00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,440\n>> Oh, that's right.\n\n573\n00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,960\n>> Yeah.\n\n574\n00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,830\nOops.\n\n575\n00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,880\nAll right, let's uncheck that one.\n\n576\n00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,220\nLet's just do, 8.1.\n\n577\n00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,080\nThat's probably good for us right now.\n\n578\n00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,160\n>> Yeah.\nSure.\n\n579\n00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,090\n>> We are in Assure Pak?\n\n580\n00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,090\n>> Yeah, you should do an Assure Pak.\n\n581\n00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,030\nThat's the best decision.\n\n582\n00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,540\nWindows Live.\n\n583\n00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,680\nMost definitely keep Windows Live.\n\n584\n00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,170\nAll right, good enough.\n\n585\n00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,550\nSo there are the product categories\nthat we'll then pull down and\n\n586\n00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,820\nmanage those guys.\n\n587\n00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,530\n>> So instead of getting every single\nupdate, right, what we're actually saying\n\n588\n00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,620\nis limit it, filter it out to\nthese picker updates as well.\n\n589\n00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,110\nScrolling on down for\nthe next section, right?\n\n590\n00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,150\nThe classifications.\n\n591\n00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,180\nWe did select, what did we select, the-\n>> Windows 8.\n\n592\n00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,320\nAnd office.\n>> Yup.\n\n593\n00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,330\nAll right, so within Windows 8 and\nOffice what kind of updates do we want?\n\n594\n00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,130\nCritical updates, security, definition?\n\n595\n00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,700\n>> Yes.\n\n596\n00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,280\nSo we can select those items there.\n\n597\n00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,420\nUpdate rollups, sure, why not?\n\n598\n00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,790\n>> Hey, look at that the rules.\n\n599\n00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,440\n>> And now, automatic approval rules.\n\n600\n00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,960\nSo, funny story, well maybe it's not that\nfunny, but another host we have here,\n\n601\n00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,670\nMike Rodrick, I was talking to Mike\nabout automatic approval rules.\n\n602\n00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,390\nAnd we hey, you know like,\nwhat a fantastic thing, you know?\n\n603\n00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,350\nYou can just set these automatic approval\nrules whenever you get a critical update\n\n604\n00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,640\nor your definitions update,\njust push those guys out, you know.\n\n605\n00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,970\nLeast administrative effort, right?\n\n606\n00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,600\nAnd so Mike he says, well,\nNate remember why we're\n\n607\n00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,380\ngoing by selecting these updates in\nthe first place, to test these updates.\n\n608\n00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,350\nIf you just approve everything,\nand spit them right out it kind\n\n609\n00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:16,620\nof defeats the purpose of testing updates\nand ruling them out to select groups.\n\n610\n00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,360\nYeah.\n\n611\n00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,400\n>> But you know for us Ronnie,\nlet's live on the edge.\n\n612\n00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:29,850\nSo we'll go and set,\nwe'll say this the rule to rule them all.\n\n613\n00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,350\n>> There you go.\n\n614\n00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,480\n>> Click on next, all right.\n\n615\n00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,250\nAnd so\nwhich products are affected by this rule?\n\n616\n00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,130\nAnd we'll kind of scroll on down here\nif I didn't pass it already Windows 8?\n\n617\n00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,870\n>> No, you didn't pass it.\n\n618\n00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,020\n>> Towards the bottom?\n\n619\n00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,730\n>> Yep.\n\n620\n00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,120\nThere you go.\n\n621\n00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,680\n>> We'll just do Windows 8.1,\nso it'll affect you and I.\n\n622\n00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,050\nYou and me.\n\n623\n00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,440\nAnd we'll just do it for\n\n624\n00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,970\nall class, nah, that's crazy\nDefinition updates and critical.\n\n625\n00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,350\nAll right, and we'll click on that.\n\n626\n00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,267\nAll right, and so now which groups\nare we gonna target this rule at?\n\n627\n00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:10,944\nAnd since it's just you and\nI, we'll do all computers.\n\n628\n00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:12,428\nAll right?\n\n629\n00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:13,362\nThat will get this rule.\n\n630\n00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:15,211\nWe'll just click on next in\nour little summary screen.\n\n631\n00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:17,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n632\n00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,060\n>> And finish.\n\n633\n00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,590\n>> And now we have a rule.\n\n634\n00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,490\n>> Right.\n\n635\n00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,370\nSo now that is our\nautomatic approval rule so\n\n636\n00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,310\nwhenever we get one of those critical\nupdates or definition updates,\n\n637\n00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,660\nthen Windows Intune will automatically\npush that update out to our machines.\n\n638\n00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,340\n>> Yup\n>> Pretty fancy stuff.\n\n639\n00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,420\nOh yeah, let's click on save.\n\n640\n00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:41,870\nIt was covered up by my picture\nthere when we clicked on save.\n\n641\n00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,350\nSo there it goes,\nthere's updates through Windows Intune.\n\n642\n00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,110\n>> Yeah.\n\n643\n00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,460\nNow we'll just mention this one too.\n\n644\n00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,830\nThere's other things that you can use,\n\n645\n00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,670\nsuch as System Center\nConfiguration Manager to do this.\n\n646\n00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,960\nAnd usually those are the machines that,\nfor us its a huge infrastructure.\n\n647\n00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,990\nYou can actually manage updates\nthrough that as well but\n\n648\n00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:04,710\nthey are only going to manage the devices\nthat are joined to your domain.\n\n649\n00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,915\nFor us here we want to ask\nyou to at least mention that.\n\n650\n00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:11,760\nYou're probably not going to see a lot of\nthat but here we've actually shown you\n\n651\n00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,860\nthe independent things that you\ncan do on the individual machine.\n\n652\n00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,900\nAs well as use a management console like\n\n653\n00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,930\nWindows NT which is our cloud management\nconsole for us to be able to do this.\n\n654\n00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,810\nThere's a lot to actually update then,\nright?\n\n655\n00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,880\n>> Yeah quite a bit.\n\n656\n00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,430\nQuite a bit of updates.\n\n657\n00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:32,090\nNow we can also manage\nnon Microsoft updates.\n\n658\n00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,350\nSo now going through the Windows\nupdate right like on our client.\n\n659\n00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,580\nWe can get other, non Windows updates.\n\n660\n00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,620\nSo we can get updates for\nOffice and other stuff.\n\n661\n00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,610\nOffice just comes to mind.\n\n662\n00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,414\nNow, through Windows Intune we can\nget those updates that are not\n\n663\n00:33:51,414 --> 00:33:53,250\nMicrosoft at all.\n\n664\n00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,560\nLet's say if we had an update for,\nwhat's something that gets updated a lot?\n\n665\n00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,880\nFlash.\n>> Yeah, Flash, Java.\n\n666\n00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,770\nAll the time, like three times a day.\n\n667\n00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,300\n>> So let's say we have some kind of,\n\n668\n00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,880\napart from that let's say we\nhave a line of business app.\n\n669\n00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,560\nA line of business app that is getting\nsome new update that we're rolling out.\n\n670\n00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,890\nWell we can roll that update\nthrough Windows Intune.\n\n671\n00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,390\n>> All right.\n\n672\n00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,820\nThen back over in our\nlittle Windows Intune deal,\n\n673\n00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,070\nwhen you click back on our updates.\n\n674\n00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:32,892\nFor our tasks,\nwe can click over there on upload.\n\n675\n00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:39,890\nNow it's gonna run the little plug-in\nhere and open up a new little wizard.\n\n676\n00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,028\nAs it clicks on through,\nyes, we'll click on run, So\n\n677\n00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:50,880\nRon, would you download something so\nquickly over your satellite?\n\n678\n00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,836\n>> Never\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n679\n00:34:52,836 --> 00:34:55,160\n>> What do you do with all that time?\n\n680\n00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,620\nWhile you sit there wait for stuff.\n\n681\n00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,895\n>> I do other things that\nare not Internet related.\n\n682\n00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:04,410\n[LAUGH] I guess you can't just go browse\nthe internet while somethings downloading.\n\n683\n00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:04,910\n>> No not easily.\n\n684\n00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:13,660\n>> All right once this guy pops up,\nlet me authenticate again.\n\n685\n00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,940\nSweet.\n\n686\n00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,230\nThere we go.\n>> It kept you signed in.\n\n687\n00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,670\nKeep signed in.\n\n688\n00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,490\nAt least.\n\n689\n00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,000\nIsn't Window's great?\n\n690\n00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,250\n>> It's wonderful.\n\n691\n00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:25,750\nI love it.\n\n692\n00:35:26,845 --> 00:35:29,007\n>> And once this guy slowly comes up.\n\n693\n00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:33,295\nNow the process of the uploading\none of these updates is a lot like\n\n694\n00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:37,080\nuploading software packages\nthrough Windows Intune.\n\n695\n00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,070\nAll right,\nhere we've got this little screen,\n\n696\n00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,635\nthis is Don Pezet's favorite screen,\noh, he's not listening.\n\n697\n00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:44,124\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so\n\n698\n00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:45,870\nnow we have to select which update.\n\n699\n00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,860\nNow, I don't have any particular\nupdates for the line of business app.\n\n700\n00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,300\nAnd on this machine.\n\n701\n00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,460\n>> I don't think we have any of them.\n\n702\n00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,780\n>> Yeah, goodness, I don't think\nwe have anything on this machine.\n\n703\n00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,100\n>> And this is the place where you would\nactually get that if you wanted to, right?\n\n704\n00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:05,140\nSo if you actually want to make sure that,\nagain, it's really about the BYOD stuff or\n\n705\n00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,980\nline of business apps that you\nwant to push out that are not\n\n706\n00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,510\nfound by Microsoft automatically,\nthis is where you would go to upload it.\n\n707\n00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,450\nAnd from that point you could push those\nout as well, is what it comes down to.\n\n708\n00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:21,643\n>> Sorry Ronnie, I was just getting a\nlittle sidetracked just to find something\n\n709\n00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:22,850\nthat we can put up there.\n\n710\n00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,538\nHow about Notepad?\n\n711\n00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:25,648\n>> All right.\n\n712\n00:36:25,648 --> 00:36:29,330\n>> So, this will be an update for\nNotepad which is, yeah,\n\n713\n00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,340\nall new Notepad, all right.\n\n714\n00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,590\nWell click on next here we'll,\nPublisher, we'll say.\n\n715\n00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,760\nMakers of Notepad right.\n\n716\n00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,718\nSo we'll fill this out classifications,\nupdates, description.\n\n717\n00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:47,552\nAll right, that works, and for\nthe architecture right X86 or\n\n718\n00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:51,670\nyeah, I see turbid, and operating system.\n\n719\n00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,390\nI'll just prove it forward just for us.\n\n720\n00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:57,090\nAnd all newer, all right, that works.\n\n721\n00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,960\nAll right, and now what kind of rule.\n\n722\n00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,550\nNow, let's say we're putting\nout this line of business app.\n\n723\n00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,810\nNow, how is Windows Intune\ngonna know whether or\n\n724\n00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,800\nnot one of our clients needs this update,\nright?\n\n725\n00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,510\nSo, we can create a rule here.\n\n726\n00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:15,400\nSo, we can tell Windows Intune\nwhether the file exists, right?\n\n727\n00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:23,040\nIt can look for a product code, we can\nset that, or some kind of registry key.\n\n728\n00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,410\nAnd we'll just say all right, you'll use\nthe default detection rules, all right.\n\n729\n00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,370\nAnd specify, oh yeah which now\nwe're starting to run into things.\n\n730\n00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,580\nOh yeah, sweet.\n\n731\n00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,910\nSo we'll say if you have Audacity,\nthen you need this update.\n\n732\n00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,660\nHow's that?\n\n733\n00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,170\n>> Sure.\n>> So\n\n734\n00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,470\nspecify the software in which\nthis update depends on.\n\n735\n00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,760\nAnd you of course, rather than\nselecting Audacity we would select\n\n736\n00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,440\nwhatever line of business\napp that this update is for.\n\n737\n00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:58,380\nSelect that and any other switches or\narguments for it we'll just say no.\n\n738\n00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:04,790\nHow do you want to specify\nthe installation codes are interpreted?\n\n739\n00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,780\nWell is we can set certain event codes.\n\n740\n00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,280\n>> Yeah.\n\n741\n00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,020\n>> Go through event viewer,\nwe check on those installation codes.\n\n742\n00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,580\n>> Right.\n\n743\n00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,480\n>> And\nperhaps we can set up a scheduled task,\n\n744\n00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,730\nthat if a certain event code does pop up,\nwe can notify somebody.\n\n745\n00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,750\nWe can notify you, Ronnie.\n\n746\n00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,300\n>> Right.\n>> But you know that everything\n\n747\n00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,296\ninstalls [CROSSTALK].\n\n748\n00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:24,295\n>> Is ready to go.\n\n749\n00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:25,154\n>> We'll just say no.\n\n750\n00:38:25,154 --> 00:38:26,792\n>> All right.\n\n751\n00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:28,800\n>> And our little summary screen.\n\n752\n00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,780\nAll right, everything looks good,\neverything looks fine.\n\n753\n00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,220\nAnd we'll click on Upload.\n\n754\n00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:39,370\nAnd now upload this update for our line\nof business app up into Windows Intune.\n\n755\n00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,580\nIt's now gonna use those detection rules.\n\n756\n00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:46,020\nWe're gonna find out who needs it and\nit can find out when it is installed.\n\n757\n00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,840\nThose event codes out there.\n\n758\n00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,400\nAnd there we go.\n\n759\n00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,410\nSo now we can manage those updates.\n\n760\n00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n761\n00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,350\n>> The key to ensuring that this works,\nright,\n\n762\n00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:58,180\nis to get that Windows Intune client\non the computer first, right.\n\n763\n00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,770\nSo that then it can connect and be able\nto actually connect to your Intune.\n\n764\n00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,090\nAnd then it can actually\nbe managed in this way.\n\n765\n00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:09,720\nNow that's a lot for the idea of\nupdating services here that we have.\n\n766\n00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,280\nBut all this again is in the hopes and\n\n767\n00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,740\nof course in the expectations that we\ncan bring our machines into compliance.\n\n768\n00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,920\nNow, Nate, we've blown through\nour particular time limit here.\n\n769\n00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,550\nSo that's fine.\nBut\n\n770\n00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,510\nit is actually a good time for\nus to take a break at this at this point.\n\n771\n00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,570\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that, and we've got more.\n\n772\n00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,430\nWe've got a lot more to actually show\nyou in terms of client compliance.\n\n773\n00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,933\n>> All right,\nall that stuff after the break.\n\n774\n00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:38,757\n[MUSIC]\n\n775\n00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:39,350\nAll right.\n\n776\n00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,360\nWelcome back.\n\n777\n00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,070\nSo where we left we were talking\nabout those non-Microsoft updates.\n\n778\n00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,010\nAnd just a couple more things\nto touch on before we move\n\n779\n00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,140\non past our little update section there.\n\n780\n00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,880\nSo on our Windows Intune machine.\n\n781\n00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,600\nSo we did get that updates\nuploaded up in there and\n\n782\n00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,140\nyou know we can view these update reports.\n\n783\n00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,498\nSo we can see what updates have gone out.\n\n784\n00:40:03,498 --> 00:40:05,662\nThen in our little over view,\n\n785\n00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:09,998\ndown there at the bottom we\nhave our non Microsoft updates.\n\n786\n00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:16,580\nSo, now, we can view that update that we\nput up in there, and we can edit things.\n\n787\n00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,193\nWe can right click on this guy and\nedit its properties.\n\n788\n00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:21,278\n>> Nice.\n\n789\n00:40:21,278 --> 00:40:24,254\n>> And we can view the computers\nwho haven't gotten it,\n\n790\n00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:26,600\nor all that fun stuff there.\n\n791\n00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,450\nNow, let's say, you have a line of\nbusiness app, and you're pushing it\n\n792\n00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:38,420\nout through a WSUS Server, or something of\nthat nature, and you're not using Intune.\n\n793\n00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,480\nWell, there is a policy that we can set,\nand it's not through Intune, but\n\n794\n00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,610\nback over in our local\ngroup policy settings.\n\n795\n00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,750\nSo, we'll just kind of go back down\nin our administrative templates, and\n\n796\n00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,000\nWindows components and\n\n797\n00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,210\ndown to Windows update, there is\na setting there at the very bottom.\n\n798\n00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:06,410\nAnd it says,\nallow signed updates from an Intranet,\n\n799\n00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:11,360\nthat'd be like our WSUS, our Intranet\nMicrosoft update service location.\n\n800\n00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,100\nAnd in this policy,\nit sets whether or not the automatic\n\n801\n00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,980\nupdates will accept signed updates\nthat are not from Microsoft.\n\n802\n00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,660\nNow, the signed updates has to be in\nthe Trusted Publishers Certificate Store\n\n803\n00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,070\non the local computer.\n\n804\n00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:37,170\nAnd if you have a line of business app,\nlike a modern UI style app,\n\n805\n00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,550\nchances are that we'll be a signed,\ntrusted app.\n\n806\n00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,816\nAnd if you need to push out an update\nthrough that, then enabling this policy\n\n807\n00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:49,380\nwill ensure that it'll get wrapped\nup in those automatic updates and\n\n808\n00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,630\nyou can push that out to your clients.\n\n809\n00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,280\n>> Now, this is something\nthat we've mentioned before,\n\n810\n00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,460\nthat a lot of times it's\nnot just standalone.\n\n811\n00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,039\nRemember, this is probably gonna be\nused in conjunction with specifying\n\n812\n00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,670\nthe Intranet update here as well.\n\n813\n00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,630\nSo, remember that both of these\nactually would have to be in effect for\n\n814\n00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,640\nthis to actually work.\n\n815\n00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,720\nIf you specify one, but not the other,\nit may not work as well as you want it to.\n\n816\n00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,440\nSo, a lot of times they have\nto work in conjunction.\n\n817\n00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,843\nSo, do remember that as well.\n\n818\n00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:14,379\n>> Yep.\n\n819\n00:42:14,379 --> 00:42:15,157\n>> Yep.\n\n820\n00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,120\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n821\n00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,550\nThat's what I've got for updates.\n\n822\n00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,498\n>> Wow, that's quite impressive\nin terms of updates.\n\n823\n00:42:21,498 --> 00:42:22,110\nIt is.\n\n824\n00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,102\n>> Yeah and updates are very important.\n\n825\n00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:27,500\n>> They are.\n>> Especially for our client compliance.\n\n826\n00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,830\nMake sure they stay up to date.\n\n827\n00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,630\nMake sure that they stay protected.\n\n828\n00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,600\n>> Yeah, and it is by far one of the more\nimportant things that we can do.\n\n829\n00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,840\nAnd actually helps us again, to ensure\nthat our machines are ready to function\n\n830\n00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,420\nthe way that we want them to\nactually function as well.\n\n831\n00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,715\nNow, we wanna move into\nthe area of protection, too.\n\n832\n00:42:45,715 --> 00:42:48,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A lot of times when we do this.\n\n833\n00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,330\nIn previous operating systems,\n\n834\n00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:54,850\nMicrosoft really didn't kind of\njump neck deep into this idea.\n\n835\n00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,480\nAnd they said, look, make sure you\nrun antivirus on the computer and\n\n836\n00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,850\nrun some type of anti-malware\non the computer.\n\n837\n00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,061\nAnd then, you had your choice of\nvendors that was out there, and\n\n838\n00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:07,589\nyou would pick whatever one that you\npicked here, that choose to run.\n\n839\n00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:14,463\nWell, Windows 8.1 already has built into\nit the idea of Windows Defender for us.\n\n840\n00:43:14,463 --> 00:43:17,772\nAnd so, really,\n\n841\n00:43:17,772 --> 00:43:22,848\nthis is the key component in\n\n842\n00:43:22,848 --> 00:43:27,492\nterms of our antivirus.\n\n843\n00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:29,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I couldn't remember the word I\n\n844\n00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:29,830\nwas trying to say.\n\n845\n00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,020\nI was trying.\nI was over there like it's not coming.\n\n846\n00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,934\n>> Sorry,\nI was gonna throw you a bone, but\n\n847\n00:43:33,934 --> 00:43:36,029\nI didn't know what you were going through.\n\n848\n00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,600\n>> So, for us here,\nI'm gonna just use the good old\n\n849\n00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,820\nsearch tool cuz apparently I can't\nfind it the way I wanted to.\n\n850\n00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,150\nI actually just went into\nthe control panel and\n\n851\n00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,740\nI typed in Windows Defender at this point.\n\n852\n00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,320\nAnd so, we really wanna take a look\na at the settings that we can actually\n\n853\n00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,880\nuse to control the updates that\nactually go on here, as well.\n\n854\n00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,720\nBefore I do that,\nlet me see if I can bring in my\n\n855\n00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,670\nzooming software here to try and\nhelp us out.\n\n856\n00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,130\nNow, it looks fairly plain and\n\n857\n00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,960\nrelatively vanilla in terms\nof what we actually do see.\n\n858\n00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,850\nSo, this is not one of those exciting\nantiviruses that you don't have\n\n859\n00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:22,460\na little jumping man across the screen,\nor some type of bells and whistles to it.\n\n860\n00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,430\nIt's the plainest one that I've ever seen,\nwhen it comes down to it, and so,\n\n861\n00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,590\non this homepage,\nthere's really not a lot you can do.\n\n862\n00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,830\nThis is installed by default that we have,\nand\n\n863\n00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,920\nnotice you have these different scan\noptions over here on the right-hand side.\n\n864\n00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,030\nAnd of course, you have the button\nthat tells it to scan right now.\n\n865\n00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,150\nIn terms of updates, and this goes back\nto what we were just talking about here,\n\n866\n00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,550\nnotice that we have the definitions\nthat Nate was pointing out, and\n\n867\n00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,580\nthis one is all the way up to date, and\n\n868\n00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:56,220\nwe can see the time the definitions were\nlast updated and created here, as well.\n\n869\n00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:01,110\nYou can also take a look at the history of\nthings, what has been quarantined at one\n\n870\n00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:05,940\npoint, allowed items not detected, to help\nspeed up the action of your computer.\n\n871\n00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,245\nAnd we actually know that there's some\nremovable drive and it detects it,\n\n872\n00:45:09,245 --> 00:45:11,237\nyou may choose not to\nactually run it there but\n\n873\n00:45:11,237 --> 00:45:14,400\nif you haven't actually run it before,\nyou may choose to.\n\n874\n00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,820\nSo, this way quarantine items,\nof course, you can scan on your own and\n\n875\n00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,470\nsee items that\nWindows Defender did pick up.\n\n876\n00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,856\nWhere we're really focusing in\non is right here at the end,\n\n877\n00:45:23,856 --> 00:45:26,033\nin terms of the settings that we have.\n\n878\n00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:31,490\nNow, I went through those but I know that\nthese settings may take a little bit.\n\n879\n00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,220\nHere, let's go ahead and\nkind of view them.\n\n880\n00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,430\nHere, okay?\n\n881\n00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,270\nSo, on the upper left-hand\ncorner of that settings tab,\n\n882\n00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,380\nthe real-time update, usually we're\ngonna leave this one turned on,\n\n883\n00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,360\nnotice the excluded files and location.\n\n884\n00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,520\nAgain, there's certain files, you go, hey,\nI don't want it to actually have to run\n\n885\n00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,640\nthrough all those things and\nlocations here.\n\n886\n00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,010\nYou can actually exempt some of these\nlocations, even certain file types,\n\n887\n00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,220\neven processes that are running.\n\n888\n00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,340\nWhat we really wanna do is actually\ntake a look at these last three,\n\n889\n00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,050\njust briefly, right here,\nto help protect us.\n\n890\n00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:08,355\nSo, I'm gonna click on\nthis advanced one here.\n\n891\n00:46:10,105 --> 00:46:12,375\nAnd then,\nlet me see if I can zoom in again.\n\n892\n00:46:13,465 --> 00:46:14,005\n>> You know, Ronnie.\n\n893\n00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:17,325\n>> Yeah.\n>> With those, excluding the files and\n\n894\n00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:17,975\nfolders.\n\n895\n00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,219\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, our other host here,\n\n896\n00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:21,498\nMike Broderick,\n\n897\n00:46:21,498 --> 00:46:26,880\nhas this folder on his computer that\nhas a lot of viruses and hacking tools.\n\n898\n00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm not sure what exactly.\n\n899\n00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,760\nHe says, they're for\ntesting purposes on his machine.\n\n900\n00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,600\nBut in this folder,\nit is just a giant folder that is full\n\n901\n00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,285\nof just a bunch of stuff that most people\nwould not want on their computers.\n\n902\n00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:42,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n903\n00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,430\nso, hopefully he has it somehow\nsafely contained in that folder.\n\n904\n00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,060\nBut so, if he runs Defender,\njust regular straight up,\n\n905\n00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,460\nit's gonna find that folder and\njust nuke everything in there.\n\n906\n00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,720\nSo, he's set up exclusions in\nthere to not scan that folder.\n\n907\n00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,440\nSo, it'll leave all those tools and\nviruses and\n\n908\n00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,220\nwhatever other junk he has stored up in\nthere, it'll just leave it all alone.\n\n909\n00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,969\nAnd he doesn't have to worry about\nDefender accidentally wiping it out.\n\n910\n00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:11,457\n>> Yeah, and again, those excluded file\ntypes, if you don't want them to actually\n\n911\n00:47:11,457 --> 00:47:15,100\ngo through and let's say,\nscan like ISOs or something like that,\n\n912\n00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,290\nyou can also do that, and then,\nother processes that are running.\n\n913\n00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,413\nBut it's really here under advanced,\n\n914\n00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:25,155\nwe wanna take a look at if I can get\nthis tool to work here, there we go.\n\n915\n00:47:25,155 --> 00:47:31,580\nAnd we can tell it what to scan and\nagain other exclusions as well.\n\n916\n00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,070\nScan archive files.\n\n917\n00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,320\nYou may choose to, you may not.\n\n918\n00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,680\nRemember that when you\ndownload a lot of times,\n\n919\n00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,970\nyou are actually getting zip files here.\n\n920\n00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,870\nAnd you may not actually\nknow what's in it.\n\n921\n00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,330\nSo, making sure you scan\nthose things is another one.\n\n922\n00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,070\nRemoval of drive.\n\n923\n00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,990\nNotice that this is not chosen by default.\n\n924\n00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,850\nAnd then, restore points.\n\n925\n00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,810\nThat may be something good that\nyou want to actually turn on.\n\n926\n00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,590\nSo, that you can bring the computer\nback to an earlier state and\n\n927\n00:47:54,590 --> 00:48:00,680\ntime before it actually does go ahead and\nremove anything as well.\n\n928\n00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,780\nAnd then, of course, the ability to\nactually do some of the other things here.\n\n929\n00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,240\nRemoving the quarantine files.\n\n930\n00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,975\nYou don't wanna keep building forever.\n\n931\n00:48:05,975 --> 00:48:07,884\nYou wanna be able to\ndelete it after a while.\n\n932\n00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:11,622\nAnd then, this last one is\nprobably one I'd turn off.\n\n933\n00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,577\nRight here.\n\n934\n00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:17,360\nSo send file samples automatically for\nfurther analysis.\n\n935\n00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,505\nA lot of times Microsoft is getting so\nmany of these, right, and\n\n936\n00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:23,090\nthey're like okay, we've already done\nthat, we're deleting it anyways.\n\n937\n00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,020\nUnless you believe that\nyou found a problem.\n\n938\n00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,840\nI don't know.\n\n939\n00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,769\nZero day virus.\n\n940\n00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:27,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n941\n00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,830\n>> Which we all believe\nthat is a zero day virus.\n\n942\n00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,060\nBut on just a little further\ninspection there probably isn't.\n\n943\n00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:37,132\nWhen it gets onto your computers here,\nyou may choose not to send this to.\n\n944\n00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:38,256\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n945\n00:48:38,256 --> 00:48:42,880\nYeah, sometimes a defender comes\nacross a particular file or something,\n\n946\n00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,060\nthat you may not know what it is or\nhow it's even needed.\n\n947\n00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,790\nThen that file will then\njust sit in quarantine.\n\n948\n00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:54,475\nAnd after a certain amount of time in\nfinding that it doesn't break something,\n\n949\n00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:56,425\nor it was an unneeded file.\n\n950\n00:48:56,425 --> 00:49:00,705\nThen yeah, sure, then it'll go and clear\nthat stuff out, at that specified time.\n\n951\n00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:05,625\n>> Yep, now here on this second\nto the last one that we have,\n\n952\n00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:08,515\nin this option down here,\n\n953\n00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:13,500\nnotice that this is getting involved into\nthe Microsoft community here as well.\n\n954\n00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:18,030\nThe Microsoft active protection services\nautomatically reports malware and\n\n955\n00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:22,840\nother forms of potentially unwanted\nsoftware to Microsoft, is want it does.\n\n956\n00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,670\nAnd you can tell it you don't want to\nbe apart of it, send basic information,\n\n957\n00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,660\nor even more that should\ndo more to help out.\n\n958\n00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,400\nSo, if you wanna be apart of that,\nof course, you can do that.\n\n959\n00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,000\nNow in all those other ones,\nright, there's really not a lot.\n\n960\n00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,620\nOkay?\n\n961\n00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,120\nIf you do have files and\nlocations you don't want scanned, again,\n\n962\n00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,640\nyou have the ability to do that.\n\n963\n00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,850\nBut on the advanced, doing some\nof the different settings there.\n\n964\n00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:46,915\nIt is here.\n\n965\n00:49:46,915 --> 00:49:51,230\nOkay, and the administrator one says,\nturn on this app.\n\n966\n00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,910\nNow, what is that about?\n\n967\n00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,070\nWell if you have your own antivirus,\n\n968\n00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:00,440\na lot of times Windows Defender\ndoes not play well with other anti.\n\n969\n00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,370\nAs soon as you go and install,\n\n970\n00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:04,650\nit's gonna tell you Windows Defender\nwould like you not to do this.\n\n971\n00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:08,880\nIt doesn't say that but it says,\nwe're already running this, don't do that.\n\n972\n00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,230\nBut here, notice here, okay, when this\ncheckbox is selected this app will alert\n\n973\n00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,500\nall users if spyware and other things\nare actually potentially running.\n\n974\n00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,410\nSo yes you actually do need\nto disable it or turn it on.\n\n975\n00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,040\nIn other words, it's not running.\n\n976\n00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,580\nYou're not actually using\na third party antivirus here.\n\n977\n00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,820\nYou may want to actually make sure\nthat you know that this is where\n\n978\n00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,968\nyou go to turn that on.\n\n979\n00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:33,631\n>> Now, with supporting client compliance,\nright, so\n\n980\n00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:37,530\njust like Windows Updates,\nyou get in your definitions,\n\n981\n00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:42,860\nmaking sure that your computer has been\ngetting its scans done is important.\n\n982\n00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,670\nAll right?\n\n983\n00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:49,565\nAnd so, just like with the updates, we can\ncontrol what it is, like these settings.\n\n984\n00:50:49,565 --> 00:50:54,690\nIf end users turn this off because\nthey say well if I turn this off my\n\n985\n00:50:54,690 --> 00:51:00,135\ncomputer will run faster, or the Internet\nwill be quicker if I turn this thing off.\n\n986\n00:51:00,135 --> 00:51:02,410\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Well we can control that, and\n\n987\n00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,490\nmake sure that they do not.\n\n988\n00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:10,350\nSo, to get back into our\nlocal group policy settings,\n\n989\n00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:15,930\nand computer configuration administrative\ntemplates, windows components,\n\n990\n00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:19,695\nand down here in the bottom in the Ws.\n\n991\n00:51:19,695 --> 00:51:20,925\nWindows Defender.\n\n992\n00:51:20,925 --> 00:51:23,775\nNow there's a lot of settings in here and\nwe won't cover,\n\n993\n00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,995\nwe won't really click through\nthese this time around.\n\n994\n00:51:26,995 --> 00:51:31,495\nBut depending on what it is that you're\nafter, chances are there is a setting\n\n995\n00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:35,885\nin here, where you can control what it is\nabout Defender that you want to do to make\n\n996\n00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:39,423\nsure that those clients stay\nin your company's compliance.\n\n997\n00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:40,926\n>> Mm-hm, correct.\n\n998\n00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:42,508\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n999\n00:51:42,508 --> 00:51:46,560\nNow, so this is Windows Defender and\nWindows Defender stuff.\n\n1000\n00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,370\nNow, Windows Intune,\nit also has its own little\n\n1001\n00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:56,450\nprogram that will check for viruses, and\nmalware, and the things lurking onto it.\n\n1002\n00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,110\nAnd we can pull that guy up.\n\n1003\n00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,780\nI believe I have it.\n\n1004\n00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:07,253\nOn the VM that's on my machine.\n\n1005\n00:52:07,253 --> 00:52:08,860\nAnd let's see.\n\n1006\n00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,830\nJason, can we go full-screen right quick?\n\n1007\n00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:18,050\nSo on my machine, we're gonna click\non our little arrow down there,\n\n1008\n00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,950\nand this little green shield right there.\n\n1009\n00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,330\nThat is the one that we are after.\n\n1010\n00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,480\n>> Oh, that's fancy.\n\n1011\n00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,410\n>> Just like that and click on Open.\n\n1012\n00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,280\nAll right.\n\n1013\n00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,810\nWindows InTune Endpoint Protection.\n\n1014\n00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,920\n>> Hey, that looks familiar, Nate.\n\n1015\n00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,870\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n1016\n00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:37,580\nIt does look awfully familiar.\n\n1017\n00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:44,060\nNow this is the little program\ncontrolled there with Windows InTune.\n\n1018\n00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:50,060\nAnd much like Defender, right,\ncheck our update history,\n\n1019\n00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,450\nand the history of certain\nitems if we have any in there.\n\n1020\n00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,572\nNo.\nMy history is all empty, so\n\n1021\n00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,125\nI am with compliance.\n\n1022\n00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:57,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1023\n00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,070\n>> And in through the settings it\ndoes look a lot like Defender.\n\n1024\n00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:01,570\n>> Yeah.\n\n1025\n00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:06,960\n>> And all of those settings,\nexcept this one is through Windows InFune.\n\n1026\n00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,790\n>> Notice that here it gives you that\nyellow bar, right, that says, hey,\n\n1027\n00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:14,260\nthis is gonna be managed somewhere else,\nokay.\n\n1028\n00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,610\nFor us, this is gonna be the idea of\nin tune is what we actually have.\n\n1029\n00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:22,010\nIn tune is now able to control this.\n\n1030\n00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,140\nThen that way,\nwe can go ahead and say look,\n\n1031\n00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,846\nNate's computer has not been\nscanned in a months time,\n\n1032\n00:53:26,846 --> 00:53:30,357\nwe can go ahead if we know that he is\nusing it right now, tell the scanner,\n\n1033\n00:53:30,357 --> 00:53:34,468\nokay, and actually go ahead and send that\nand it's going to be controlled that way.\n\n1034\n00:53:34,468 --> 00:53:39,572\nThis also helps us ensure that\nsomebody is not modifying it, in other\n\n1035\n00:53:39,572 --> 00:53:46,370\nwords just turning off the idea of the\nWindows Endpoint Protection is what it is.\n\n1036\n00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,770\nNow, the unusual thing is this.\n\n1037\n00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:51,060\nDidn't what you just showed me,\n\n1038\n00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,610\nwasn't that exactly what\nWindows Defender was doing?\n\n1039\n00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:55,700\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay,\n\n1040\n00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:00,800\nWindows Defender on the stand alone\nmachine is Windows Defender by itself.\n\n1041\n00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,840\nInTune really changes the name of it,\nbut also puts in hooks, so\n\n1042\n00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,330\nit can manage it again from that\ncloud services portal, okay?\n\n1043\n00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,340\nNow, if you are part of a large\norganization that was also running\n\n1044\n00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,516\nSystem Center Configuration Manager,\nyou would see this and do we,\n\n1045\n00:54:16,516 --> 00:54:19,718\ndo you know what the name of that is,\nactually, officially called?\n\n1046\n00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:22,558\nIs it the configuration\nmanager protection something?\n\n1047\n00:54:22,558 --> 00:54:24,551\n>> End point protection, I was.\n\n1048\n00:54:24,551 --> 00:54:25,800\n>> Is it still end point protection?\n\n1049\n00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,827\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it's probably the system center and\n\n1050\n00:54:27,827 --> 00:54:28,840\nprotection manager.\n\n1051\n00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,000\nAnd if you went into that,\nyou'd probably see a name change on top.\n\n1052\n00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,800\nInstead of Windows InTune,\nit would be System Center Configuration or\n\n1053\n00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,290\nConfiguration Manager\n2012 Endpoint Protection.\n\n1054\n00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:45,520\nAnd it would look the same, okay,\nis what it would actually look like.\n\n1055\n00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,031\nSo all three of those,\nin terms of the interface, kay,\n\n1056\n00:54:49,031 --> 00:54:53,590\nare really gonna be that way,\nwhereas the endpoint, or the InTune, and\n\n1057\n00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,218\nthe Configuration Manger is\ngonna be managed remotely.\n\n1058\n00:54:57,218 --> 00:55:00,385\nWindows Defender, you tend to manage\nright here on the individual computer.\n\n1059\n00:55:00,385 --> 00:55:01,087\nMm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1060\n00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,600\nNow with, let's say there's a custom\nsetting that you wanna roll out\n\n1061\n00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,620\nthrough Windows Intune to\nmanage the endpoint protection.\n\n1062\n00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,070\nLet's say for some computers,\n\n1063\n00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:18,390\nlet's say that you and\nI we want more relaxed policies.\n\n1064\n00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,460\nBut with Jason and\n\n1065\n00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,370\nhis computer I mean, who knows what\nthis guy does with his machine.\n\n1066\n00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:24,450\nSo we really want to lock that thing down.\n\n1067\n00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,040\nWe can set certain policies to control\nthe behavior of Endpoint Protection.\n\n1068\n00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,050\nAnd I believe, yeah, you and Ryan,\nwe did briefly cover policies before.\n\n1069\n00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,256\nAnd we can just click over here,\nand click on Add a Policy.\n\n1070\n00:55:38,256 --> 00:55:42,700\nAnd Intune Agent Settings is\nwhat we were after, all right.\n\n1071\n00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,630\nSo create and deploy a policy\nwith the recommended settings.\n\n1072\n00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,920\n>> Nah.\n>> We'll do a custom policy.\n\n1073\n00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,650\nSo once this guy grinds its way out.\n\n1074\n00:55:53,650 --> 00:56:02,009\nWe're gonna call this one\nJason's lockdown policy.\n\n1075\n00:56:02,009 --> 00:56:04,125\nAll right.\n\n1076\n00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:07,931\nAnd for this one, all right, yeah,\nnumber settings won't quite go through.\n\n1077\n00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:12,360\nAll of them but we will install\nthe end point protection definitely.\n\n1078\n00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,168\nAnd enable all this stuff.\n\n1079\n00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:15,265\nAll right.\n\n1080\n00:56:15,265 --> 00:56:17,765\nTrack malware, yes, that is all turned on.\n\n1081\n00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:20,320\nReal-time protection, definitely.\n\n1082\n00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:25,320\nWe will leave that guy turned on,\nand we will scan all the downloads.\n\n1083\n00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,112\nBasically, I guess every setting,\nwe should turn on for this guy.\n\n1084\n00:56:29,112 --> 00:56:31,900\nAll right, now for\na daily quick scan, yes.\n\n1085\n00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,065\nBut we're going to scan this for 1 p.m.\n\n1086\n00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,370\nJason eats lunch at his desk and\nbrowses the internet,\n\n1087\n00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:45,420\nas soon as he comes back from lunch,\nwe're gonna scan that guy.\n\n1088\n00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:52,080\nAnd a full scan, yes, we'll do every day\nat 6 p.m., so right after he leaves.\n\n1089\n00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,120\nAnd then all these options,\nyada, yada, yada.\n\n1090\n00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:00,720\nAll right, and\nthen we will save this policy, and\n\n1091\n00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,080\ndeploy this policy, definitely.\n\n1092\n00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,680\nNow, we don't have Jason's computer.\n\n1093\n00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:09,200\nI'd have logged into Windows Intune or\njoined to it, so yeah.\n\n1094\n00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,980\nWe won't push this one out right now.\n\n1095\n00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,640\nBut then we would select Jason's\ngroup that his computer is in,\n\n1096\n00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,655\nwhich will probably be all by itself.\n\n1097\n00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:19,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz he sits over there all by himself.\n\n1098\n00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,810\nAnd, so yeah.\n\n1099\n00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,460\nWe're gonna rollout that way.\n\n1100\n00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,590\nAnd we set those custom policies for\nfour different machines.\n\n1101\n00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,570\n>> Yep.\n\n1102\n00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,160\nIt looks good.\n\n1103\n00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:29,520\n>> All right.\n\n1104\n00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,370\nSo Ronnie, what do you have lined up?\n\n1105\n00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,990\nOr, does that answer everything with\n>> Yep.\n\n1106\n00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:35,830\nPretty much.\n\n1107\n00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,090\n>> Defender and Intune,\nEndpoint Protection?\n\n1108\n00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,335\n>> I believe so, yeah.\n\n1109\n00:57:39,335 --> 00:57:40,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So,\n\n1110\n00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,160\nremember that a lot of times you may see\n\n1111\n00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,960\nany one of those three varieties in\nwhatever you're actually setting up here.\n\n1112\n00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,960\nIf your organization is\nactually managing computers,\n\n1113\n00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,980\nnot only within the organization, but\n\n1114\n00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,760\nalso again users that are actually\ngonna be outside the organization.\n\n1115\n00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,130\nThey're working from their own laptops and\nstill need the control, you may be using\n\n1116\n00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:06,630\nthe Windows Intune Endpoint Protection.\n\n1117\n00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:09,940\nIf your really just talking about\nthe domain machines, okay, and\n\n1118\n00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,000\nyou have the infrastructure for it,\n\n1119\n00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,795\nprobably through the System Center\nConfiguration Manager 2012,\n\n1120\n00:58:13,795 --> 00:58:16,160\nyou're gonna see that name change there.\n\n1121\n00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,458\nAnd on the individual standalone\ncomputer working with Defender,\n\n1122\n00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,370\nkind of the same settings here.\n\n1123\n00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,060\nOn the standalone, you actually\nmanipulate the settings in Endpoint and\n\n1124\n00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,080\nin Intune, excuse me.\n\n1125\n00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,600\nIn Intune and the configuration manager,\n\n1126\n00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,562\nthey're going to be managed remotely,\nI think is the key for us.\n\n1127\n00:58:32,562 --> 00:58:33,562\n>> Nice.\n\n1128\n00:58:33,562 --> 00:58:35,730\nAll right,\nwell we have a few minutes left,\n\n1129\n00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:40,290\nDon, we did run a little over on\nlast time, so that wraps that up.\n\n1130\n00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:44,730\nNext, we have is getting into\ngood old Internet Explorer, and\n\n1131\n00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,620\nits settings and things that it can do.\n\n1132\n00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,170\nShould we jump into that now?\n\n1133\n00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,310\nShould we get it after the group?\n\n1134\n00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,030\nRonnie?\n>> Let's go ahead and\n\n1135\n00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,840\nget it after the break here,\nand then we'll come back and\n\n1136\n00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:58,180\nwe'll do our next segment here\non our Internet Explorer 11.\n\n1137\n00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,270\n>> Nice, all right.\n\n1138\n00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,936\nIE 11 after the break.\n\n1139\n00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:05,562\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1140\n00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:09,575\nwelcome back.\n\n1141\n00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:10,314\nAll right, so\n\n1142\n00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:14,580\nwhere we left off before the break is we\nwere getting into Internet Explorer 11.\n\n1143\n00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:20,780\nAnd how we can yield that tool to help\nus aid in supporting client compliance.\n\n1144\n00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,840\n>> You know now,\nit doesn't seem like it's that important.\n\n1145\n00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,356\nBut remember that the-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1146\n00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:25,290\n>> It really doesn't, right?\n\n1147\n00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,430\nEverybody uses it every day.\n\n1148\n00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,790\nWe don't even think about it as\nactually being a real important tool.\n\n1149\n00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:33,991\nBut if you don't have a web browser to\nactually browse out there somewhere, so\n\n1150\n00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:36,650\nthere it is, I'm catching up on my news.\n\n1151\n00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,320\nI just launched it is what I did here.\n\n1152\n00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:45,910\nBut companies use browsers all the time to\naccess Internet sites that they need to.\n\n1153\n00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:50,760\nBut we here at ITProTV,\nwe love the fact that we have our business\n\n1154\n00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,380\nactually up there on the Internet for\nyou to be able to go to as well, and\n\n1155\n00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,400\nto watch the previously recorded episodes,\ntoo.\n\n1156\n00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,680\nSo, it's really important in terms of\na business, or even on your own computer,\n\n1157\n01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,550\nthat we set these security settings\nthat we need to, to ensure that you can\n\n1158\n01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:09,960\nactually do the things that need\nto be down through your browser.\n\n1159\n01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,605\nAnd we're really focusing in on the\ndefault browser that comes with Windows\n\n1160\n01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:16,875\n8.1, which is gonna be\nInternet Explorer 11.\n\n1161\n01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:17,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1162\n01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,110\n>> Yep.\n\n1163\n01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:24,082\n>> All right so, there's a number of tools\nand things with Internet Explorer 11,\n\n1164\n01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:29,350\n[COUGH] that we can use to help keep our\nclients, [COUGH] excuse me, in compliance.\n\n1165\n01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:32,710\nAnd add it to our company's policy,\nand the first one,\n\n1166\n01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:36,020\nI suppose would be the compatibility view.\n\n1167\n01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,580\n>> Yeah.\n>> Caterpillar.\n\n1168\n01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,685\n>> Compatibility view.\n\n1169\n01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:42,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Will help Internet Explorer properly\n\n1170\n01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:48,070\ndisplay web pages that were meant for\nearlier editions of Internet Explorer.\n\n1171\n01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:48,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n1172\n01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:52,690\nEvery once in a while, you may pull up a\nweb page that either just doesn't display,\n\n1173\n01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:56,810\nand you knew it did at one point on\nanother version of Internet Explorer or\n\n1174\n01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,250\nsome other browser.\n\n1175\n01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:03,050\nAnd Internet Explorer 11 gives you that\nability to run that compatibility view\n\n1176\n01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:05,700\nto essentially make it run in\nan earlier version like 10 or\n\n1177\n01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,370\nmaybe even 9 at times, for what we need.\n\n1178\n01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:14,960\nSo this is one of the actually important\nsettings that we can go ahead and adjust.\n\n1179\n01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:20,490\nNow a lot of times on your webpages,\nInternet 11, Internet Explorer 11 normally\n\n1180\n01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:25,890\nautomatically, it actually senses that\na page may not display correctly.\n\n1181\n01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:30,940\nYou might see up here in the upper\nleft-hand corner on the address bar,\n\n1182\n01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,590\nlet's see if I can zoom\nin a little bit more.\n\n1183\n01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:40,939\nOn the address bar up here,\nTrying to get the pointer ready.\n\n1184\n01:01:40,939 --> 01:01:42,454\nSomewhere around this area,\n\n1185\n01:01:42,454 --> 01:01:45,970\nyou might see where there's\na little torn sheet of paper.\n\n1186\n01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:49,420\nIf it believes that that particular\npage may not display correctly,\n\n1187\n01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,620\nit may actually give you a little\ntorn sheet of paper right here.\n\n1188\n01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:57,170\nWe can simply click on it, and\nthat compatibility view comes right in for\n\n1189\n01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,810\nus, and that way,\nit automatically shows that up.\n\n1190\n01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:04,150\nBut what if you can't?\n\n1191\n01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:06,980\nWhat if the actual compatibility view,\nand you go, hey,\n\n1192\n01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,150\nI want to actually see\nwhat this page looks like.\n\n1193\n01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,600\nWell, over on the right-hand side,\nwe have, of course,\n\n1194\n01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,230\nthese three icons up here.\n\n1195\n01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,570\nAnd there, of course,\nis the home page, and\n\n1196\n01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,610\nthat's where your favorites are located.\n\n1197\n01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:23,350\nAnd it is here in the gear that\na lot of times you can click on and\n\n1198\n01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:27,500\nthen notice that on the drop down menu,\nthe third from the bottom here,\n\n1199\n01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,760\nI have where it says Compatibility\nView Settings that I can click on.\n\n1200\n01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,250\nAnd now I can simply add in the site\n\n1201\n01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:41,340\nthat I want to actually be able to display\nin compatibility view at this point.\n\n1202\n01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,290\nOkay?\nIt says,\n\n1203\n01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,720\nchange the compatibility view here.\n\n1204\n01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,060\nAnd I simply type in\nthe name of the website.\n\n1205\n01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,040\nAnd I'm just gonna add\nthis one in cuz I'm here.\n\n1206\n01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:50,640\nClick Add.\n\n1207\n01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:55,820\nAnd now, notice it says,\nuse Microsoft's compatibility list.\n\n1208\n01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,200\nNow this means everybody kind\nof generated a list here, and\n\n1209\n01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,570\nwe want to as well, to do this,\nbut we can add this one in.\n\n1210\n01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:06,020\nClose, and now you're looking like,\nwhat's the big deal?\n\n1211\n01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,110\nNothing.\n\n1212\n01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:10,526\nBecause this bigger site\nis rendered properly,\n\n1213\n01:03:10,526 --> 01:03:15,192\nhopefully since it is MSN here,\nthe Microsoft Network news here,\n\n1214\n01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:18,960\nthat this is what it's supposed to be and\nready to go.\n\n1215\n01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,388\nAnd that doesn't mean that every site by\nMicrosoft might do it, but for this one,\n\n1216\n01:03:22,388 --> 01:03:24,139\nit's not gonna display in differently.\n\n1217\n01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:28,754\nBut if you do happen to have a site\nthat you believe is not gonna display\n\n1218\n01:03:28,754 --> 01:03:34,130\ncorrectly, you can at least try this\ncompatibility view to make it work.\n\n1219\n01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:36,000\n>> Now once you set a site for\n\n1220\n01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,355\ncompatibility view, either other than\nadding it in to that little list.\n\n1221\n01:03:41,355 --> 01:03:45,193\nInternet Explorer 11 will remember those\nsites that are in compatibility view.\n\n1222\n01:03:45,193 --> 01:03:49,475\nAnd the very next time that you browse\nto it, it will kick that guy on there.\n\n1223\n01:03:49,475 --> 01:03:52,685\nNow one little check box, Ronnie,\nyours didn't have it checked.\n\n1224\n01:03:52,685 --> 01:03:53,725\n>> Yep, mine did not.\n\n1225\n01:03:53,725 --> 01:03:54,457\n>> It is checked.\n\n1226\n01:03:54,457 --> 01:04:01,194\nBy default, that is it down there, display\nIntranet sites in compatibility view.\n\n1227\n01:04:01,194 --> 01:04:03,239\nBy default the intranet sites, so\n\n1228\n01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:06,985\nsites that aren't necessarily\npublished onto the Internet.\n\n1229\n01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:12,043\nSites that You know, you can use more\nresources inside of your local network.\n\n1230\n01:04:12,043 --> 01:04:19,010\nIntranet sites, compatibility view is\nenabled for those sites by default.\n\n1231\n01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:22,780\n>> Yeah, and that's cuz a lot of times\nyour particular sites may not be ready for\n\n1232\n01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:28,070\nInternet 11, and they may be older\nthan Internet 11 actually came out.\n\n1233\n01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,910\nSo if you're not able to run it,\nyou may actually choose to do that and\n\n1234\n01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:33,890\nsee if everything works perfectly well,\nyep.\n\n1235\n01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:37,070\n>> All right,\nnow what about the security zones?\n\n1236\n01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:42,180\nAll right, so there are different security\nzones for Internet Explorer 11, so\n\n1237\n01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:48,930\nwe'll click on a little gear there and\ngo into our Internet Options.\n\n1238\n01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,600\nAnd on the Security tab, all right, so\n\n1239\n01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,580\nthere are four main security\nzones that we have here.\n\n1240\n01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:01,380\nSo we have the Internet zone, and\nnow this is for, I guess, all the pages,\n\n1241\n01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,910\nthere by default, for on the Internet.\n\n1242\n01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:07,680\nAnd different levels of security\nthat we have by default\n\n1243\n01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,550\nMedium High is what it is set at.\n\n1244\n01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:13,620\nAnd by dragging the bar up we can have it\n\n1245\n01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:16,845\nmore restrictive on what\nit does to reign things in.\n\n1246\n01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:20,190\nAnd we can drag it down even lower.\n\n1247\n01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:20,870\nMedium.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1248\n01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:25,850\n>> So, medium would be, is the lowest\nthat we can drag here for this zone.\n\n1249\n01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:31,290\nOn medium it says down there, unsigned\nActiveX controls will not be downloaded.\n\n1250\n01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:34,490\nPrompt before potentially unsafe content.\n\n1251\n01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,580\nSure, that sounds great.\n\n1252\n01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,840\nGreat and dandy for me there.\n\n1253\n01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,480\nAnd we can set custom levels for\nthis zone right here.\n\n1254\n01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,270\nAnd by default Protected Mode is on for\nthe Internet zone.\n\n1255\n01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,070\nThe local intranet zone, so\n\n1256\n01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:52,950\nwhat we were just talking about with\nthose compatibility view, right?\n\n1257\n01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:57,590\nSo, for this one, by default,\nMedium-Low is its settings, and\n\n1258\n01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:01,160\nof course what it can do right there.\n\n1259\n01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,920\nAnd by default, Protected Mode\nis turned off for these sites.\n\n1260\n01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:09,750\nThe next one here, Trusted Sites.\n\n1261\n01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:13,618\nSo if there is a particular\nsite that you go to, right?\n\n1262\n01:06:13,618 --> 01:06:18,048\nFor whatever it is, if you're getting\nproblems with the site, right?\n\n1263\n01:06:18,048 --> 01:06:20,230\nIf it's not displaying correctly.\n\n1264\n01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:24,130\nIf you need to enable cookies for it or\n\n1265\n01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,860\nsomething of that nature,\nyou can set it with the trusted sites.\n\n1266\n01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,570\nYou can add it to there.\n\n1267\n01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:32,310\nWe can click on sites here, I guess by,\n\n1268\n01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:35,620\nI guess I just pulled whatever\npage I was currently on.\n\n1269\n01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,580\nLet's add that for fun, right there.\n\n1270\n01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,210\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n1271\n01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:42,930\nSo now we've added that\ninto our trusted sites.\n\n1272\n01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:47,060\n>> And then, of course, there's restricted\nsites, which you can actually just block.\n\n1273\n01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:51,320\nWhatever site you want to and it's not\ngonna get access to your browser at all.\n\n1274\n01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,230\nNow a lot of times in terms of\nusing the trusted sites right?\n\n1275\n01:06:55,230 --> 01:07:01,180\nYou may actually be accessing something\nlike a partner's website, right?\n\n1276\n01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:04,220\nAnd you want to actually be\nable to allow your users,\n\n1277\n01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:07,910\nokay, to connect to it\nwithout having to worry about\n\n1278\n01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:11,610\nother security things that they\nalways have to click through.\n\n1279\n01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,750\nAdding that particular site into\nthe trusted sites may be the way to go,\n\n1280\n01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:17,210\nso that your users simply\ncan browse that site.\n\n1281\n01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:21,344\nAnd then they can connect without having\nto worry about responding to a lot of\n\n1282\n01:07:21,344 --> 01:07:25,410\nthe security notifications that\nactually pop up there for us.\n\n1283\n01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:29,200\nSo, when you do have scenarios like that,\nyou do want to pay attention to that.\n\n1284\n01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,367\nIf you actually are asked to\ndo something like that, right?\n\n1285\n01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:35,160\nAdding in trusted sites\nis pretty much a key,\n\n1286\n01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,116\nin a lot of things that we\ndo around here as well.\n\n1287\n01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:43,671\n>> All right, so other items here\nthat are worth bringing attention to.\n\n1288\n01:07:43,671 --> 01:07:48,515\nAnd on the Privacy tab,\nwe do have good old pop up blocker.\n\n1289\n01:07:48,515 --> 01:07:49,060\n>> Yeah.\n\n1290\n01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,370\n>> By default pop up blocker is enabled.\n\n1291\n01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:59,017\nAnd clicking on the Settings button we can\nset the functions for our pop up blocker.\n\n1292\n01:07:59,017 --> 01:08:03,590\nIf there is a particular website\nthat we want to allow pop ups for,\n\n1293\n01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:05,725\nwe can type in the address here.\n\n1294\n01:08:05,725 --> 01:08:09,375\nYou can add them to\nthe allowed sites right there.\n\n1295\n01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:13,290\nAnd so down here, Blocking level right, so\n\n1296\n01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:17,810\nblock ups will be automatically\nblocked for this guy right here.\n\n1297\n01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:18,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n1298\n01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,940\nYeah, in terms of the actual privacy\nsettings that you have, right?\n\n1299\n01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:25,970\nThis is all about the idea of\ncookies that we actually have.\n\n1300\n01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,680\nAnd cookies, again, is the information\nwhich the web server actually\n\n1301\n01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,000\nputs onto your computer to allow them to\nactually do, well, several things, right?\n\n1302\n01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,760\nSome of them can be malicious.\n\n1303\n01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,700\nSome of them, of course, are actually\nperfectly benign like the ones that you\n\n1304\n01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,670\nactually use when you go to our site here.\n\n1305\n01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:43,320\nThey allow us to be able to track\nthat you're actually on the page.\n\n1306\n01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,350\nSo, every time you actually go and\nmanipulate or navigate to a different\n\n1307\n01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,530\npage, that you're not kicked out and\nhave to log back in again.\n\n1308\n01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:50,080\nOkay?\nSo,\n\n1309\n01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,590\nwhen you go to our website, the cookies\nare actually there so that it can say,\n\n1310\n01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:56,740\nall right, you're actually the same user\nas what was previously logged in, so\n\n1311\n01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,930\nyou don't get kicked out and\nstuff like that.\n\n1312\n01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,200\nSo a lot of these settings that you\nactually have here are about that\n\n1313\n01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,220\npicker idea of what needs to be done.\n\n1314\n01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,600\nSo notice that this one says, select\na setting for the Internet zone, and\n\n1315\n01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,120\nthis one, am I on the right,\nyeah, on that page.\n\n1316\n01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,580\nOf course,\nyou can actually block all cookies,\n\n1317\n01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:17,920\nwhich would make just about the entire\nInternet inaccessible, if you want to.\n\n1318\n01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,070\nAnd of course, you can actually adjust\nthose to whatever your company's security\n\n1319\n01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:21,675\npolicy is.\n\n1320\n01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:25,070\nProbably the one of course, they don't\nrecommend is accept every single\n\n1321\n01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:27,130\ncookie that's actually out there, okay?\n\n1322\n01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,705\nCuz this can include all\nmalicious stuff that can go on and\n\n1323\n01:09:29,705 --> 01:09:31,696\ngrab information from\nyour computer as well.\n\n1324\n01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,387\n>> Mm-hm.\nAll right, so Ronnie, so\n\n1325\n01:09:33,387 --> 01:09:35,190\nlet me ask you this.\n\n1326\n01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:39,390\nNow what is one thing with Internet\nExplorer, or just even browsers in\n\n1327\n01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:44,610\ngeneral, that you find that users\nask to remove or help with?\n\n1328\n01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:45,550\nI don't wanna give it away.\n\n1329\n01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n1330\n01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:48,232\n>> That users need help with often?\n\n1331\n01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:52,630\n>> [LAUGH]\nUsers need help with often?\n\n1332\n01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:53,840\nTyping in the address.\n\n1333\n01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is that what you're talking about?\n\n1334\n01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,004\n>> I don't wanna to give it away, but\nit was kinda vague, but, add-ons.\n\n1335\n01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:00,608\n>> Add-ons.\n\n1336\n01:10:00,608 --> 01:10:01,357\n>> Add-ons.\n\n1337\n01:10:01,357 --> 01:10:02,972\n>> Yeah.\n>> Add-ons with Internet Explorer\n\n1338\n01:10:02,972 --> 01:10:03,920\n11, right?\n\n1339\n01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,774\nSo add-ons, these are like toolbars,\nlittle plugins there that\n\n1340\n01:10:08,774 --> 01:10:13,291\nsupposedly expand the functionality\nof Internet Explorer.\n\n1341\n01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:17,910\nMany times just get in the way of\nthings just a daggone nuisance.\n\n1342\n01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:23,850\nA lot of time these add-ons are bundled\nin with free software installs.\n\n1343\n01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:26,290\nKind of sneak in there out of the way.\n\n1344\n01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:29,620\nNow let's say we want to\nmanage these add-ons.\n\n1345\n01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:34,070\nWe want to remove some of them if they're\nbeing intrusive for who knows what reason.\n\n1346\n01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:37,690\nMaybe a bunch of blinky\nlights on the toolbars.\n\n1347\n01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:40,320\nNow, in with Internet Explorer 11.\n\n1348\n01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,980\nWhen you click on the little gear\nicon here, and down right there.\n\n1349\n01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,600\nManage add-ons.\n\n1350\n01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,036\nNow, in this window, all right so,\n\n1351\n01:10:51,036 --> 01:10:54,500\nwe can see what the current\ninstalled add-ons are.\n\n1352\n01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,904\nSo, on my machine, here,\nI just have the LastPass stuff.\n\n1353\n01:10:57,904 --> 01:11:00,180\nAnd it says we got Silverlight here.\n\n1354\n01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:03,950\nShockwave, and now let's say LastPass.\n\n1355\n01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:09,150\nIf LastPass was giving me lots of\nproblems, we can uninstall that guy.\n\n1356\n01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:15,220\nThe LastPass toolbar, by selecting\nthis guy, we can click on Disable.\n\n1357\n01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:18,050\nAll right, I like LastPass, so\nI won't disable this guy, right now.\n\n1358\n01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:23,950\nAnd we can browse through our other\ntypes of add-ons that I have in\n\n1359\n01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:26,060\nhere is the Bing add-on.\n\n1360\n01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,950\nWe should definitely leave that guy there.\n\n1361\n01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,905\nYeah, other items here, but\nthe toolbars and extensions,\n\n1362\n01:11:31,905 --> 01:11:37,625\nthis is where we can go to remove\nthose items from clients' machines.\n\n1363\n01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:41,659\n>> Yeah, usually for us in terms of\nadd-ons, right, Windows has at one point,\n\n1364\n01:11:41,659 --> 01:11:43,981\ntried to be all things to all people,\nright,\n\n1365\n01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:46,530\nand allowed everything to connect in.\n\n1366\n01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:49,921\nToday, they kind of limit it and say hey,\nif you want to actually be able to connect\n\n1367\n01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:53,560\nto certain things, and add in certain\nfeatures, you add them on yourself.\n\n1368\n01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,240\nAnd that way you can control them\na little bit easier, and better here,\n\n1369\n01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,164\nby saying whether you want them to run or\nif you want to disable them, you can.\n\n1370\n01:11:59,164 --> 01:12:01,880\nOkay?\nSo there are still a few basic things that\n\n1371\n01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,655\nthey do by default a lot of times,\nand they do put them in.\n\n1372\n01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,133\nSo like for some reason or another-\n>> Oh, you've got a lot.\n\n1373\n01:12:08,133 --> 01:12:10,083\n>> Yeah, I've got.\nMore than I realized here.\n\n1374\n01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:14,949\nSo here, the Microsoft Skydrive Pro\nBrowser Helper, which I went ahead and\n\n1375\n01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:18,000\ndisabled cuz I don't know\nif I need that or not.\n\n1376\n01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,140\nLink, I don't know why that's, and\nnotice this one says it's new.\n\n1377\n01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:27,440\nWhich, I don't know why my picker\nmachine is doing that, but there you go.\n\n1378\n01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,560\nAnd so a lot of times by visiting certain\nsites, they already start adding in\n\n1379\n01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,941\nthings, and you're supposed to actually be\nable to say yes to these things, as well.\n\n1380\n01:12:34,941 --> 01:12:38,322\nAnd then there's that, oh, look,\nJava, who would have thought?\n\n1381\n01:12:38,322 --> 01:12:42,490\nOh look, send to OneNote, I disable that\nand so you actually see some of these\n\n1382\n01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:47,070\nagain that really are about expanding what\nyour web browser can actually do for you.\n\n1383\n01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:48,830\nOkay?\nAnd not only do we have those,\n\n1384\n01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:51,120\nyou can add in the search providers.\n\n1385\n01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,590\nThese accelerators, I don't have any\naccelerators, do I need accelerators?\n\n1386\n01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,530\n>> Not, yeah no.\n\n1387\n01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:59,190\nNot in this day and age.\n\n1388\n01:12:59,190 --> 01:12:59,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n1389\n01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:00,770\nNot so much so.\n\n1390\n01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:03,890\nBut you actually see that these\nare other features that can be done.\n\n1391\n01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:06,940\nNow, in our business, we've actually\nhad this when people wanted to make\n\n1392\n01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:11,140\nthird party calls as well that required\na certain add-on that should be put\n\n1393\n01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,800\ninto the browser, so\nthey could connect in with that software.\n\n1394\n01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,450\nAnd I believe that's where\nthat link thing came in.\n\n1395\n01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:20,280\nI was testing it out at one point for\none of our people.\n\n1396\n01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,555\nAnd it worked perfectly fine\nin Internet Explorer 11 and\n\n1397\n01:13:23,555 --> 01:13:25,105\napparently I've never took it off.\n\n1398\n01:13:25,105 --> 01:13:28,700\n[LAUGH] This is what happens.\n\n1399\n01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:29,387\n>> All right.\n\n1400\n01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:34,697\nThey'll say there are some add-ons, right,\nthat can get buried in here where having\n\n1401\n01:13:34,697 --> 01:13:39,610\nInternet Explorer open, you cannot\ndisable or remove some of these add-ons.\n\n1402\n01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now there is the option,\n\n1403\n01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:46,420\nthe ability to remove these add-ons\nwithout firing up Internet Explorer, and\n\n1404\n01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,720\nin some cases you may need to.\n\n1405\n01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,060\nAnd to get there, right, so\nwe'll just go into our Start screen.\n\n1406\n01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:57,650\nWe'll just type in, Internet options,\nright, so on that second one right there.\n\n1407\n01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:01,150\nNow I do have Internet Explorer\nopen right now, but\n\n1408\n01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:05,200\nthis right here Internet Options,\nthis right here will open up regardless.\n\n1409\n01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,200\nWell you know what,\nlet's just go ahead and do that.\n\n1410\n01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:13,216\nI'll close that,\nwe'll close out all that stuff,\n\n1411\n01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:18,010\nclose out all the tabs,\n[SOUND] Internet Options.\n\n1412\n01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:22,882\nSo now we can get into our options, and\nwe can manage those things that we wish\n\n1413\n01:14:22,882 --> 01:14:26,388\nwithout actually opening up\nInternet Explorer and for\n\n1414\n01:14:26,388 --> 01:14:29,207\nany kind of stubborn add-ons or\ntoolbars or\n\n1415\n01:14:29,207 --> 01:14:33,589\nanything else in there that we need\nto clear out or clean or whatnot.\n\n1416\n01:14:33,589 --> 01:14:37,800\nWe can do that, yeah by going here without\nhaving to open up Internet Explorer.\n\n1417\n01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:41,340\n>> Now speaking of that where I thought\nyou were going with the idea of\n\n1418\n01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:44,520\nremoving things right,\nis where the browser itself\n\n1419\n01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,470\nalso tends to remember a lot of things for\nyou automatically.\n\n1420\n01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:51,500\nSo, a lot of times when you,\n\n1421\n01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:56,230\nI remember the first time, or sort of\nthe first time this happened, right.\n\n1422\n01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:01,580\nBack in the days of Internet Explorer 5 or\n6, I don't remember exactly the day.\n\n1423\n01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:06,300\nBut I went to go to a website, and\nthen I clicked on something and\n\n1424\n01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:10,290\nall of a sudden my information\nthat I had typed in\n\n1425\n01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:14,780\nduring the installation of that\nparticular operating system,\n\n1426\n01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:18,380\nit automatically filled out my name and\nmy address.\n\n1427\n01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:22,240\nAnd other things into a form on a site\nthat I had never been to before.\n\n1428\n01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:22,880\nOkay?\n\n1429\n01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,930\nAnd that kind of weirded\nme out a little bit.\n\n1430\n01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,220\nWhere in the heck did they get\nall this information from?\n\n1431\n01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,110\nWell where it actually comes in and\n\n1432\n01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:31,996\nInternet properties has been\naround forever and a day.\n\n1433\n01:15:31,996 --> 01:15:32,718\nOkay?\n\n1434\n01:15:32,718 --> 01:15:38,890\nAnd so on the content page here, okay,\ndown at the bottom or I should say\n\n1435\n01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:42,580\nsecond to bottom here, this auto complete\nis where I thought you were going.\n\n1436\n01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:43,110\n>> Oh, right?\n\n1437\n01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n1438\n01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:48,020\nSo in these settings here,\nthis is where I go, and\n\n1439\n01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:51,160\nso, by default in earlier versions,\n\n1440\n01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:55,935\nthese things actually had both of\nthese things checked up and all that.\n\n1441\n01:15:55,935 --> 01:15:58,650\nAnd so a lot of times when you\ndon't want that showing up,\n\n1442\n01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,870\nyou can simply go ahead and\nuncheck those two.\n\n1443\n01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:04,690\nNow this is also where you\ncan type in the address and\n\n1444\n01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:08,439\nautomatically fill out the rest\nof the address for you as well.\n\n1445\n01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,080\n>> All right.\n\n1446\n01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,590\nNow let's say that you're on,\nout in a field, or you're on somebody\n\n1447\n01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:19,700\nelse's computer and you need to get into\nInternet Explorer 11 to do something.\n\n1448\n01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,320\nBut it's on somebody else's computer, and\n\n1449\n01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,650\nyou don't want to leave any traces\nbehind so as you work on their machine,\n\n1450\n01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:30,770\nthere is an option and\nit is called in private browsing.\n\n1451\n01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:33,760\nAnd with in private browsing\nrunning in this mode,\n\n1452\n01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:39,140\nany history, any place that you've been,\n\n1453\n01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:44,410\nit covers up all the tracks on where\nyou've been with browsing on the Internet.\n\n1454\n01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:48,790\nAnd to get to that guy right, so,\nwe can click on the little gear here, and\n\n1455\n01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:52,302\nSafety, and In Private Browsing.\n\n1456\n01:16:52,302 --> 01:16:53,470\nRight there.\n\n1457\n01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:58,330\nNow it will open up a new window and\n\n1458\n01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:03,520\nin this window right here, it tells you\nright up here, in private is turned on.\n\n1459\n01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,489\nSo now as you browse through the Internet,\n\n1460\n01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:10,530\nnothing will be I guess of our of\nour history, places where we go,\n\n1461\n01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:13,590\nthings that we've done,\nit won't be saved here locally.\n\n1462\n01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:14,990\nIt would be wiped out.\n\n1463\n01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:20,350\n>> Yeah now this is a little bit a,\nthe term private, right?\n\n1464\n01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,840\nFor us means that,\nthat's what's going to happen.\n\n1465\n01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,000\nNow does that stuff get stored?\n\n1466\n01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,750\nYes.\n\n1467\n01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,652\nOkay, so wherever you go it's\nnot going to actually stop\n\n1468\n01:17:27,652 --> 01:17:30,760\npeople from being able to\nsee where you're going.\n\n1469\n01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,232\nBut it will as soon as you actually\ngo out and close this out.\n\n1470\n01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:36,910\nIt's gonna actually erase all\ntraces of where you have been.\n\n1471\n01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:37,920\nSo a lot of times people say hey,\n\n1472\n01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,560\nthat's the same as, so I can browse\nhere and this is completely anonymous?\n\n1473\n01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,510\nNot exactly.\n\n1474\n01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:46,130\nOkay, it is actually going to be anonymous\nafter you close out of the browser.\n\n1475\n01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:49,606\nBut not actually while\nyou're actually using it.\n\n1476\n01:17:49,606 --> 01:17:50,180\nYeah.\n\n1477\n01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,800\n>> And with everything else, right,\n\n1478\n01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,580\nthere are policies we can\nuse to lock this guy down.\n\n1479\n01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:00,230\nSo lets jump back into\nour virtual machine here.\n\n1480\n01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:06,456\nAnd [SOUND], so under Computer\nConfiguration and Administrative Templates\n\n1481\n01:18:06,456 --> 01:18:07,490\n>> Windows Components.\n\n1482\n01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:10,750\n>> And Windows Components and\nInternet Explorer.\n\n1483\n01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,230\nNow there are a number of items here and\n\n1484\n01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:17,370\nwe don't click through these guys,\nbut just about everything\n\n1485\n01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,825\nwith Internet Explorer you can\ncan control it through policy.\n\n1486\n01:18:19,825 --> 01:18:22,610\n>> Right.\n>> Now those compatibility settings,\n\n1487\n01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,210\nall right, for this policy here,\n\n1488\n01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:31,100\nwe can control those items there, and\nif we have a certain list of items for\n\n1489\n01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:35,060\nthat compatibility view,\nwe can turn that stuff on and\n\n1490\n01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,200\npush out to all of our clients so\nthat they don't have to worry about it.\n\n1491\n01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:39,700\nHeh.\n\n1492\n01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,305\nDelete browsing history.\n\n1493\n01:18:42,305 --> 01:18:44,385\nRight?\nI bet Jason's in this one a lot.\n\n1494\n01:18:44,385 --> 01:18:45,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n1495\n01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,170\nSo, [LAUGH] okay.\n\n1496\n01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:49,090\nJust kidding, Jason.\n\n1497\n01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:49,830\nAll right, so yeah.\n\n1498\n01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:54,050\nSo we can yeah,\ncontrol Internet Explorer 11 through\n\n1499\n01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:57,040\nhere to make sure that our\nclients are in compliance.\n\n1500\n01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,020\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1501\n01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:02,730\nSo there's a lot of settings for\nus here, in terms of actually getting\n\n1502\n01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:08,080\nInternet Explorer underneath what we need,\nto be controlled the way that we want to.\n\n1503\n01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,400\nNow, individually on\na standalone computer,\n\n1504\n01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,290\nif you're doing this, you're doing this\nfor all of the users that are actually\n\n1505\n01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:18,100\ngoing to be connecting into this,\nusing that local group policy, okay?\n\n1506\n01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,145\nAnd you can control that access that way.\n\n1507\n01:19:20,145 --> 01:19:23,520\nBut we're going to also take\na look in our next segment here\n\n1508\n01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,390\nabout doing the same things but\nactually for\n\n1509\n01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:29,860\nmore than one particular user as well,\nusing our group policy settings instead.\n\n1510\n01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:30,860\nYep.\n>> Yep.\n\n1511\n01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:34,050\nNow we do have a few minutes\nleft on the segment.\n\n1512\n01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:37,000\nBut, we are kind of shifting gears now and\n\n1513\n01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,190\nmoving into group policy,\ngroup policy settings.\n\n1514\n01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:48,450\nQuite a big topic here,\nit's covered heavily in our server exams.\n\n1515\n01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,160\nThat's what the deal is now.\n\n1516\n01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:55,330\nWe'll just kinda touch on it a bit more of\na client's perspective of group policy and\n\n1517\n01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:59,720\nhow we can I guess be able to\ntell what's going wrong and\n\n1518\n01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,905\nhow to find out what it is.\n\n1519\n01:20:01,905 --> 01:20:03,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n1520\n01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:07,008\n>> So I guess we'll get to all\nthat stuff after the break, right?\n\n1521\n01:20:07,008 --> 01:20:07,972\n>> Right.\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1522\n01:20:07,972 --> 01:20:09,720\n>> More group policy\nstuff after the break.\n\n1523\n01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:15,812\n[SOUND] [SOUND] All right,\n\n1524\n01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:19,775\nwelcome back.\n\n1525\n01:20:19,775 --> 01:20:21,584\nAll right, so where we left off,\n\n1526\n01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:24,880\nwe're just talking about\ngetting into group policy.\n\n1527\n01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,220\nGroup policy stuff.\n\n1528\n01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,120\n>> Right.\n>> For our client machines.\n\n1529\n01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:33,360\nAnd now we can kind of track down\nissues or maybe even determine that,\n\n1530\n01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:39,390\nwhere issues went wrong and whether or\nnot we can solve that stuff locally or\n\n1531\n01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:42,030\nif we need to escalate it\nto a system administrator.\n\n1532\n01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:46,180\n>> Now, for us, when we take a look at it,\nreally for you and\n\n1533\n01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:50,640\nme, it's gonna be inside of that\nlocal group policy editor and\n\n1534\n01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,430\nwe're working on standalone computers,\nright.\n\n1535\n01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:56,330\nThat's where we're going to go, but that\nparticular structure is a great place for\n\n1536\n01:20:56,330 --> 01:21:00,300\nyou to get started, because well that's\nreally the same structure that you tend to\n\n1537\n01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,830\nsee inside of what we call the active\ndirectory group policy which can affect\n\n1538\n01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:07,210\nmore than one computer at the same time,\nokay.\n\n1539\n01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:12,002\nSo when we start actually dealing\nwith this particular aspect, right,\n\n1540\n01:21:12,002 --> 01:21:16,793\nwe wanna make sure that we understand\nthat there's a lot of times where we\n\n1541\n01:21:16,793 --> 01:21:20,795\nmay have a policy that's pushed\nout to the computers here but\n\n1542\n01:21:20,795 --> 01:21:24,510\nit may not apply in the way\nthat we actually need them to.\n\n1543\n01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:30,318\nAnd so, we have to be able to effectively\ntry and figure out what has happened on\n\n1544\n01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:35,430\nthese bigger machines and\nwhy didn't it actually work out, right?\n\n1545\n01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,594\n>> Yeah.\nSo, then what kind of settings, or\n\n1546\n01:21:37,594 --> 01:21:41,070\nwhat kind of things that can go\nwrong with our group policy stuff?\n\n1547\n01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:44,119\nSo perhaps if we're supposed\nto be getting drive mappings,\n\n1548\n01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:47,500\ndrive mappings through policy\nthat aren't being applied.\n\n1549\n01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:52,040\nOr perhaps we're getting certain\nsecurity restrictions like updates.\n\n1550\n01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,090\nIf we find that our updates are saying\nthat they're being managed by\n\n1551\n01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:58,960\nan administrator or they're supposed to be\nand we aren't getting that notification.\n\n1552\n01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,585\nIf we can change things on our system\nthat we shouldn't be able to change.\n\n1553\n01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:05,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> There's some signs that it could be\n\n1554\n01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:09,670\na group policy issue that\nwe need to track down.\n\n1555\n01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:10,390\n>> Yeah.\n\n1556\n01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:14,750\nSo a lot of times, we can actually take a\nlook at some of the tools that we have at\n\n1557\n01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:18,940\nhand here to really help us out to\nbe able to figure this out, right?\n\n1558\n01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:23,850\nSo Nate did mention that if you actually\ndo know that a group policy has apply, or\n\n1559\n01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:25,700\nsupposed to have been pushed out but\n\n1560\n01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,390\nyou are able to actually change those\nthings, that you were trying to lock down,\n\n1561\n01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:33,070\nor restrict, well, then you know at\nthat point something else is wrong.\n\n1562\n01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:36,200\nAnd so from this point we wanna\nmake sure that we do take a look at\n\n1563\n01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,246\nsome of these settings here to help us\nout and understand what could go on.\n\n1564\n01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:45,320\n>> All right, Ronnie, so\nwe do have the local group policy and\n\n1565\n01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:48,660\nnow that stuff it just\nhandles the local stuff.\n\n1566\n01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,260\nSo, stuff on our machine here.\n\n1567\n01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:53,870\nBut then,\nyou brought up the active directory.\n\n1568\n01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:55,563\n>> Right?\n>> Active directory in the group policy\n\n1569\n01:22:55,563 --> 01:22:57,290\nsettings that we have in there.\n\n1570\n01:22:57,290 --> 01:23:00,070\nNow, it can affect everything, right?\n\n1571\n01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:03,850\nEntire domains, sites,\nright, entire forests.\n\n1572\n01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:08,080\nOf course, we won't dive too deep into\nhow everything is all structured up, but\n\n1573\n01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:14,740\nit's structured up in a hierarchical\nstructure of things, where we can put\n\n1574\n01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:19,360\nour computers and our users, and almost\nlooks like a little folder structure.\n\n1575\n01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:25,035\nAnd, depending on where items are located\nin that structure like a computer or\n\n1576\n01:23:25,035 --> 01:23:30,010\na user, certain policies will apply\nto that user or that computer.\n\n1577\n01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:34,768\n>> Yeah, now a great place for us to\nactually start is just an overview again\n\n1578\n01:23:34,768 --> 01:23:39,010\nof where a policy is actually created and\nhow this is done.\n\n1579\n01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:43,030\nSo we are gonna take a look at the local\ngroup policy here just, and then we'll\n\n1580\n01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:47,340\nmove from this point into the active\ndirectory group policy just briefly.\n\n1581\n01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:50,030\nSo I'm gonna bring up that\nlocal group policy, oops,\n\n1582\n01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:51,596\nit dropped out there for a moment.\n\n1583\n01:23:51,596 --> 01:23:59,210\nHere, okay, that's cuz I had that UAC\nturned on, is what end up happening, okay.\n\n1584\n01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:03,130\nSo, in terms of these two divisions\nthat we see right here, right?\n\n1585\n01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:06,840\nWe have a Computer Policy,\nwe also have a User Configuration.\n\n1586\n01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,090\nSo we have Computer Configurations and\n\n1587\n01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:12,420\nUser Configurations that\nwe actually deal with here.\n\n1588\n01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,060\nThese are two different settings for\n\n1589\n01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,140\nus that we actually have to\nunderstand at least the basics of.\n\n1590\n01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:17,930\nRight?\n\n1591\n01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:22,110\nThe Computer Configuration\napplies to well,\n\n1592\n01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:25,000\nanybody that logs onto\nthat particular computer.\n\n1593\n01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,620\nOkay, so it doesn't matter who logs on,\n\n1594\n01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:30,520\nthe computer configuration\nwill actually apply to them.\n\n1595\n01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,180\nSo if we wanted to for\nevery user that logs on,\n\n1596\n01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:37,900\nlet me see if I can expand out some of\nthis stuff here in terms of the, oops.\n\n1597\n01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:41,900\nWell, let me go down to\nAdministrative Templates here.\n\n1598\n01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,578\nAnd Windows Components,\n\n1599\n01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:48,008\nsomething that we can actually\naffect very easily here and updates.\n\n1600\n01:24:48,008 --> 01:24:52,781\nWhat else I'm thinking of, log on options\nhere, we can actually set this up, okay?\n\n1601\n01:24:52,781 --> 01:24:57,201\nAnd that means every user will\nactually have to deal with these\n\n1602\n01:24:57,201 --> 01:25:01,454\nparticular settings on that\nparticular computer, okay.\n\n1603\n01:25:01,454 --> 01:25:04,514\nNow, we can also affect this instead so\n\n1604\n01:25:04,514 --> 01:25:09,950\nwhen this actually applies,\nit normally applies periodically.\n\n1605\n01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:11,860\nOkay, every 90 minutes or so.\n\n1606\n01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:15,380\nOr it also applies when the computer\nrestarts is what we have, or\n\n1607\n01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,140\nwe can force it to do so.\n\n1608\n01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:22,520\nThe user configurations we can actually\nset those to specific users that log in.\n\n1609\n01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,810\nWe want that to also apply here too.\n\n1610\n01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:28,385\nSo this only applies at the log\nin of the actual computer.\n\n1611\n01:25:28,385 --> 01:25:29,910\nOkay?\nAnd so once again,\n\n1612\n01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:34,325\nyou actually have some settings that\nwill almost look exactly the same.\n\n1613\n01:25:34,325 --> 01:25:36,415\nSo notice that yes,\nyou do have two different ones.\n\n1614\n01:25:36,415 --> 01:25:39,765\nIt actually depends on where\nyou want that to happen or\n\n1615\n01:25:39,765 --> 01:25:42,825\nwhen you want that to happen,\nI should say.\n\n1616\n01:25:42,825 --> 01:25:46,727\n>> Yeah, and the computer configuration,\nso that block up there at the top.\n\n1617\n01:25:46,727 --> 01:25:52,287\nThat will affect the computer, regardless\non who logs in to that computer.\n\n1618\n01:25:52,287 --> 01:25:57,197\nAnd the user configuration settings,\nsettings that we set in there,\n\n1619\n01:25:57,197 --> 01:25:59,007\nwill apply to certain users.\n\n1620\n01:25:59,007 --> 01:26:03,270\nNow, on this local group policy here.\n\n1621\n01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:07,710\nNow, there is an order that\nthese things are applied.\n\n1622\n01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:10,650\nIt's called multiple local group policy.\n\n1623\n01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:13,670\nThere's three different levels, right?\n\n1624\n01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:17,080\nSo we have the,\njust called the local group policy, right.\n\n1625\n01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,660\nApplies to everybody, everything.\n\n1626\n01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:24,930\nThe next round of processing is for\nadministrators and non-administrators.\n\n1627\n01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:29,730\nAfter that round, we have user\nspecific group policy settings.\n\n1628\n01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:32,960\nSo that we can set certain policies for\n\n1629\n01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,535\ncertain users or we can set certain\npolicies for administrators.\n\n1630\n01:26:36,535 --> 01:26:40,685\nOr, we can set it for\nthe entire machine to rule out that way.\n\n1631\n01:26:40,685 --> 01:26:42,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n1632\n01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,560\nNow, since you actually mention it,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n1633\n01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:50,110\nshow how we can actually bring these\nthings up in terms of doing that, right?\n\n1634\n01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:54,270\nSo what I've just done is I've opened\nup a blank Microsoft Management Console\n\n1635\n01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:57,840\nby going to my Start screen and\ntyping in MMC, okay.\n\n1636\n01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,100\nMicrosoft Management Console,\nMary Mary Charlie,okay?\n\n1637\n01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:04,620\nBy doing this, I bring up this blank\nconsole called Console 1 up here, so\n\n1638\n01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:05,880\nit's generic.\n\n1639\n01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:11,240\nI can go into File and\nI can go to Add and Remove Snap-ins.\n\n1640\n01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:17,059\nAnd from this point here,\nwhat I'm looking for\n\n1641\n01:27:17,059 --> 01:27:21,810\nis the, where is my, the\n>> Group policy object?\n\n1642\n01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:22,700\n>> Group policy object.\n\n1643\n01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,600\nI was trying to read it, and\nI kept skipping over the G's.\n\n1644\n01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,470\nI was like, well that's unusual,\nit's not there.\n\n1645\n01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:33,090\nI click on Add right here, and\nnow on this picker point here,\n\n1646\n01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:37,890\nI can click on Browse and Users and\n\n1647\n01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:42,210\nnotice I can actually select\nthe Administrators here, okay,\n\n1648\n01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:47,010\nif I want to just create policies that\nwill actually affect administrators.\n\n1649\n01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:52,500\nNow, if I wanted to manage\nboth at the same time,\n\n1650\n01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,100\nI can select the Group Policy Object\nagain and click on Add.\n\n1651\n01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,140\nAnd then here in the Group Policy Wizard,\n\n1652\n01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:02,520\nI can click on Browse, and instead of\njust this computer I can do another one.\n\n1653\n01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,891\nBut here Users, I can select\nNon Administrators as well and then,\n\n1654\n01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:07,758\nthere we go.\n\n1655\n01:28:07,758 --> 01:28:12,898\nFrom this point, you'll notice that now,\nthese are user settings.\n\n1656\n01:28:12,898 --> 01:28:20,150\nThat will affect only administrators or\nonly non administrators instead.\n\n1657\n01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:22,030\nSo if you're a computer administrator and\n\n1658\n01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,670\nyou log in,\nthe policy that I set up here will apply.\n\n1659\n01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:29,620\nIf you're a non administer,\nthe policy down here will apply instead.\n\n1660\n01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:32,260\nSo you can very easily\nactually manage those,\n\n1661\n01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,866\nif you actually are needing\nto set those things up.\n\n1662\n01:28:33,866 --> 01:28:37,670\n>> Yep.\n\n1663\n01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:42,010\nNow, there are a number of tools,\nthree tools in particular\n\n1664\n01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:46,690\nthat we can check on which policies\nthat are actually being applied.\n\n1665\n01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,950\nDo we want to get into that right now?\n\n1666\n01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:49,610\n>> Sure.\n\n1667\n01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:53,360\n>> Which one do you want to do first?\n\n1668\n01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,870\n>> Pick one and we'll.\n\n1669\n01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:55,370\n>> Pick one?\n>> Yup.\n\n1670\n01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:59,071\n>> Let's do the GP result.\n\n1671\n01:28:59,071 --> 01:29:00,110\n>> Okay?\n\n1672\n01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:02,110\n>> There's a command line.\n\n1673\n01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:05,005\nCommand line, GP result.\n\n1674\n01:29:05,005 --> 01:29:08,906\nLet's just do a GP result and\na question mark.\n\n1675\n01:29:12,749 --> 01:29:16,100\nSo here are certain modifiers.\n\n1676\n01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:20,670\nCertain switches we can use to\nget back certain information.\n\n1677\n01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:25,910\nNow of these switches,\nwe can specify which domain,\n\n1678\n01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:31,440\na scope on how far reaching that\nwe want to include things in,\n\n1679\n01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:36,190\nwe can pull back the policy results for\na specific user.\n\n1680\n01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:42,313\nAnd now the slash r\njust displays the RSOP.\n\n1681\n01:29:42,313 --> 01:29:42,950\nAll right.\n\n1682\n01:29:46,189 --> 01:29:47,178\n>> Nope, wrong one.\n\n1683\n01:29:47,178 --> 01:29:49,866\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n1684\n01:29:49,866 --> 01:29:54,361\nonce this guy runs it'll spit out\na report and display all of the policies\n\n1685\n01:29:54,361 --> 01:29:58,305\nthat are currently being applied\nto this particular machine.\n\n1686\n01:29:58,305 --> 01:29:59,920\n>> Yup.\n\n1687\n01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:03,498\n>> So that is for\nyour machine and your user.\n\n1688\n01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:05,797\n>> Yep.\n>> Right, Ronald?\n\n1689\n01:30:05,797 --> 01:30:07,920\nIs all that-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1690\n01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:08,950\nNo, I just had to.\n\n1691\n01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,580\n>> So under the user settings, so\n\n1692\n01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:19,080\nwe can see those particular items that\nare being applied to just Ronnie.\n\n1693\n01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,260\nAnd these new policies are laid out there.\n\n1694\n01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:25,412\nIf you know that there's\na particular policy let's say like,\n\n1695\n01:30:25,412 --> 01:30:29,216\na drive mapping, as it being applied,\nthis command here and you'll be able\n\n1696\n01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:32,801\nto look through there see if indeed\nthat policy is being applied or not.\n\n1697\n01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:35,866\n>> Yeah.\n>> If it is, then you can go from there,\n\n1698\n01:30:35,866 --> 01:30:40,565\nif it is not, then you may need to\nescalate it to an administrator.\n\n1699\n01:30:40,565 --> 01:30:45,410\n>> Yeah, so here you can also find\nout specially from that use, what\n\n1700\n01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:50,290\npart this is actually gonna play in as\nwell, and actually put the results here.\n\n1701\n01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:55,020\nNow, you may actually wanna also be able\nto do just a couple of other things here.\n\n1702\n01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:58,720\nSo this can actually be\nput into let's say a GP\n\n1703\n01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:05,260\nresult, a text file here, I believe.\n\n1704\n01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:11,913\nI may be wrong.\n[LAUGH] Let's see, does it finish?\n\n1705\n01:31:11,913 --> 01:31:17,435\nIt finished here, so\nat this point if I do a DIR,\n\n1706\n01:31:17,435 --> 01:31:20,621\nI am looking for GP result.\n\n1707\n01:31:20,621 --> 01:31:27,994\nSo I can do notepad GP\nresult out txt here.\n\n1708\n01:31:27,994 --> 01:31:30,559\nOh, it's misspelled notepad.\n\n1709\n01:31:30,559 --> 01:31:32,413\nNot the GP result by all-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1710\n01:31:32,413 --> 01:31:33,354\n>> All means here.\n\n1711\n01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:34,549\nWho would've thought?\n\n1712\n01:31:34,549 --> 01:31:37,500\nNow you might go well,\nwhat is this useful for?\n\n1713\n01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:41,410\nWell now, if I actually don't know\nwhat's going on, I can run this.\n\n1714\n01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:43,600\nAnd then I can email this over to Nate.\n\n1715\n01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,310\nNate, can examine the actual\nresulting policy action.\n\n1716\n01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:49,515\nAnd tell me that Ronnie, you're a dummy.\n\n1717\n01:31:49,515 --> 01:31:51,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The actual policy did not apply.\n\n1718\n01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,780\n>> [LAUGH] No, I wouldn't say that.\n\n1719\n01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:55,440\nWhat are you?\n\n1720\n01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,010\nActually, I would use my\ngood professionalism and\n\n1721\n01:31:58,010 --> 01:32:02,880\ncommunication skills to communicate with\nyou and determine what the problem is.\n\n1722\n01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,370\nSo this is one of the primary ways\nthat we can actually do this.\n\n1723\n01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:08,100\nNow, we just focused in on local computer,\n\n1724\n01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:12,720\nbecause it's not that you may not\nhave access to the active directory\n\n1725\n01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:18,210\ngroup policy, but if you actually at\nleast understand the basic setup here.\n\n1726\n01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:21,250\nGoing and\nseeing the Active Directory Group Policy\n\n1727\n01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,770\nis where we're gonna find more tools.\n\n1728\n01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:25,190\nOr is there another one we want\nto show on the local computer?\n\n1729\n01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:29,060\n>> No, we can get into the main\ncontroller, that works.\n\n1730\n01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:33,130\n>> So what I've also got on my\ncomputer here, is where normally\n\n1731\n01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,390\nthe Active Directory Group Policy\nis also going to be managed from.\n\n1732\n01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:39,620\nAnd so this is our domain\ncontroller from our network, and\n\n1733\n01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,980\nhere we're running Windows Server 2012.\n\n1734\n01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:45,140\nI go to Tools,\nI already got it pulled up, but\n\n1735\n01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:50,400\nit's where the Group Policy Management\nconsole is gonna be.\n\n1736\n01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,960\nAnd so\nnotice that it actually looks like this.\n\n1737\n01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,910\nOkay, you're going well, that doesn't look\nanything like the local group policy.\n\n1738\n01:32:56,910 --> 01:33:00,430\nYou are correct, but over here on\nthe left hand side, here it is.\n\n1739\n01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:04,090\nLab.itpro.tv this is our domain and\n\n1740\n01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:06,340\neach of these little settings\nthat we see right here.\n\n1741\n01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:10,930\nLet me, I don't know if I can, it won't\nlet me, I'm trying to see if I can,\n\n1742\n01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:13,890\nI can't zoom in easily on this.\n\n1743\n01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:14,570\nI wish I could.\n\n1744\n01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,963\nOn this one here, you can see each of\nthese are actually little policies.\n\n1745\n01:33:21,936 --> 01:33:25,890\nSo we have a BranchCache hash,\nDefault Domain Policy.\n\n1746\n01:33:25,890 --> 01:33:28,740\nThat's the one that again,\napplies to all the users here.\n\n1747\n01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:35,490\nAll the computers, and map for everything\nthat's underneath that lab.itprotv.\n\n1748\n01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:39,310\nNow, if I right-click and go to Edit,\nthis where you'll see it will look fairly.\n\n1749\n01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:40,440\nOh, look at that.\n\n1750\n01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,970\nLooks almost exactly like\nthe Local Group Policy.\n\n1751\n01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:48,020\nAnd you have the Computer Configurations,\nthe policies, but\n\n1752\n01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:49,390\nwe also have what we call preferences.\n\n1753\n01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:53,205\nNow, where not gonna again, we're not\ndiving into the structure of this,\n\n1754\n01:33:53,205 --> 01:33:55,790\nbut this is where we do\nset up the policies.\n\n1755\n01:33:55,790 --> 01:34:00,292\nAnd once we set up those same things,\nnotice that Windows settings and\n\n1756\n01:34:00,292 --> 01:34:03,739\nAdministrative Templates\njust like we saw earlier.\n\n1757\n01:34:03,739 --> 01:34:05,611\nYou actually see all these\ndifferent things and\n\n1758\n01:34:05,611 --> 01:34:07,164\na few more other objects that you have.\n\n1759\n01:34:07,164 --> 01:34:09,258\nThere are thousands of settings in here,\nso\n\n1760\n01:34:09,258 --> 01:34:11,895\nwe don't have a chance to go\nthrough every single one.\n\n1761\n01:34:11,895 --> 01:34:13,570\n>> Yeah.\n\n1762\n01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:19,000\nNow, on the exam objectives there are two\ntools that it does specifically call out.\n\n1763\n01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,470\nThat is the Group Policy Modeling and\nthe Group Policy Results.\n\n1764\n01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:27,790\nNow, with Group Policy Results, that'll be\napplied too, you'll pick what items that\n\n1765\n01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:35,380\nyou want to scan for the policies that are\nbeing applied in that particular scenario.\n\n1766\n01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:37,380\nAnd Group Policy Modeling,\n\n1767\n01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:41,770\nyou can apply different policies\nto different items as like a test.\n\n1768\n01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:45,998\nSo you can find out what would happen if\nthese policies were being applied to these\n\n1769\n01:34:45,998 --> 01:34:48,625\nparticular users or\ncomputers or groups, even?\n\n1770\n01:34:49,865 --> 01:34:51,911\n>> So the easiest way to actually do this,\n\n1771\n01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:55,632\nis simply by right-clicking on\nthe Group Policy Results Wizard here or\n\n1772\n01:34:55,632 --> 01:34:58,742\nright-clicking on that and\ngo on to Group Policy Results.\n\n1773\n01:34:58,742 --> 01:35:02,027\nAnd of course, it brings up\na nice little wizard for us, and\n\n1774\n01:35:02,027 --> 01:35:06,254\nwe click next, and we can actually tell\nit what computer we are on right now.\n\n1775\n01:35:06,254 --> 01:35:09,752\nNow, we're gonna run on this one cuz I\ndon't have another computer that's up\n\n1776\n01:35:09,752 --> 01:35:13,220\nthere to join, but inside of this in\nthe Active Directory, you can do this.\n\n1777\n01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:15,010\nAnd say, for a specific computer,\n\n1778\n01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:18,957\nI want to see what is actually going on\nthat one and in terms of the group policy?\n\n1779\n01:35:18,957 --> 01:35:22,270\nAnd remember, we can control just\nabout everything in Group Policy.\n\n1780\n01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:26,490\nWe can control and actually put\nstrict compliance measures on that.\n\n1781\n01:35:26,490 --> 01:35:30,130\nWe can actually go ahead and use it for\nthe current user, and there it is or\n\n1782\n01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:31,810\nI can specify for a particular one.\n\n1783\n01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:36,450\nI'm gonna use the current one, and\n\n1784\n01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:40,880\nfrom that point, it's giving me a summary,\nand now, it's gonna actually generate it.\n\n1785\n01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,260\nLooks like it finished fairly quickly.\n\n1786\n01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:46,510\n>> Yeah,\nwe've got a pretty small directory, so\n\n1787\n01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:51,120\nthere's not a whole lot that\nwe have going on in here.\n\n1788\n01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:56,180\nNow, one thing with this\nGroup Policy Results the GP results,\n\n1789\n01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:58,580\nthe command line that we ran before.\n\n1790\n01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:02,980\nThe GP result is the command\nline version of this wizard.\n\n1791\n01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:07,940\nSo we get back the same results as if\nwe run it from this wizard here or\n\n1792\n01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:09,900\nthe command line that Ronnie,\nshowed earlier.\n\n1793\n01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,391\n>> Yep.\nSo here you actually see the results, and\n\n1794\n01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:14,847\nthat way you can view and\ntake a look at it.\n\n1795\n01:36:14,847 --> 01:36:15,991\nAnd figure out whether or\n\n1796\n01:36:15,991 --> 01:36:18,728\nnot things are actually applying\nin the way that we want to.\n\n1797\n01:36:18,728 --> 01:36:23,125\nNow, if you're not sure again,\nyou can use that\n\n1798\n01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:28,640\npolicy modeling instead to\nalso create another one.\n\n1799\n01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,410\nAnd then actually combine\ntogether the policies that\n\n1800\n01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:35,030\nyou want to actually take a look at,\nand see how it actually works.\n\n1801\n01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:38,508\n>> Now, this guy here has\na lot of more options here.\n\n1802\n01:36:38,508 --> 01:36:40,155\n>> Yeah.\n>> And let's just quickly kind\n\n1803\n01:36:40,155 --> 01:36:43,570\nof click through some of the stuff\nto see what it looks like.\n\n1804\n01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:47,890\nSo we can select which domain\ncontroller in the domain.\n\n1805\n01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:49,930\nWe want to push this policy against.\n\n1806\n01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:50,820\nThat's fine with that one.\n\n1807\n01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,670\nNow, which container?\n\n1808\n01:36:56,450 --> 01:37:00,200\nFor all the machines and computers\nthat are there in a specific one.\n\n1809\n01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,926\nLet's pick Jonesville, there.\n\n1810\n01:37:01,926 --> 01:37:06,753\nWe'll pick that one, so\nall the machines in that one\n\n1811\n01:37:06,753 --> 01:37:11,252\nwhich would just be a single\nlittle machine, for\n\n1812\n01:37:11,252 --> 01:37:15,985\ncomputer information,\nlet's do the same thing.\n\n1813\n01:37:15,985 --> 01:37:17,730\n>> So we're saying for all the users and\n\n1814\n01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:20,950\ncomputers in Jonesville,\n>> Actually, you know what?\n\n1815\n01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:23,740\nFor that top one,\nlet's change that top one.\n\n1816\n01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:28,220\nAnd let's just pick the users\ndown there at the very bottom.\n\n1817\n01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:32,090\nYeah, that works.\n\n1818\n01:37:32,090 --> 01:37:33,800\nWe'll click on next.\n\n1819\n01:37:35,970 --> 01:37:41,770\nAnd here's where we can set certain\nitems like the slow link policy.\n\n1820\n01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:44,630\nIf the computer detects\nit's on a slow link,\n\n1821\n01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:48,790\nsuch as a metered network,\ncertain policies may not be pulled down.\n\n1822\n01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:49,542\n>> Right.\n\n1823\n01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:54,316\n>> Large policies, it can cause an impact\non the way policy's are old out,\n\n1824\n01:37:54,316 --> 01:37:57,710\nin the timing and the sorts, so\nwe're gonna turn that on or off, and\n\n1825\n01:37:57,710 --> 01:37:59,170\nalso loop back processing.\n\n1826\n01:37:59,170 --> 01:38:03,340\nIf there's a particular computer\nwhere one of the user settings,\n\n1827\n01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:09,110\nto be applied to the computer portion\nwe can select that here or not.\n\n1828\n01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:11,000\nBut for here, we won't worry about it.\n\n1829\n01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,500\nAnd for site,\nthat is just our default site.\n\n1830\n01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:17,540\nSo we'll push it against that one,\nand next on through the course.\n\n1831\n01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:22,378\nAnd for this Policy Modeling Wizard\nthis is all like a theoretical setting.\n\n1832\n01:38:22,378 --> 01:38:23,951\n>> It's trying to see what happens.\n\n1833\n01:38:23,951 --> 01:38:27,470\n>> Yeah, just to see what happens,\nand authenticated users.\n\n1834\n01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:28,860\nYeah, that's fine.\n\n1835\n01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:35,960\nWe'll push that against that and yep,\nsame thing for that one the W my filters.\n\n1836\n01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:39,530\nNow, there are surge filters that we\ncan push out, perhaps if a computer has\n\n1837\n01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:44,930\na certain manufacturer or\na certain BIOS version.\n\n1838\n01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:48,380\nWe can target it against\nthose particular computers.\n\n1839\n01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:50,317\nBut for this we won't set any filters.\n\n1840\n01:38:50,317 --> 01:38:55,535\nIt's anything for computers and\nthe good old summary of what our\n\n1841\n01:38:55,535 --> 01:39:00,569\ntheoretical policy is going to be or\nthe result of the policy.\n\n1842\n01:39:00,569 --> 01:39:02,426\nAnd there we go.\n\n1843\n01:39:02,426 --> 01:39:05,420\n>> So here are the users on Jonesville.\n\n1844\n01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:07,774\nAnd we actually see what's going on.\n\n1845\n01:39:07,774 --> 01:39:08,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> Not much.\n\n1846\n01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:09,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1847\n01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,640\nNot a lot going on in\nour little domain here.\n\n1848\n01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:16,130\nAnd now underneath the modelling,\nunder the results,\n\n1849\n01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:21,100\nit does save the settings\nthat we just saved.\n\n1850\n01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,260\nAnd so, if we're to make any changes,\n\n1851\n01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:27,870\nwe can right-click on either\nthe users of Jonesville or whatnot.\n\n1852\n01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:32,709\nAnd we can choose to re run it, and\nto see what settings have taken effect.\n\n1853\n01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:35,861\nIf we were to make any changes\nto see what would happen?\n\n1854\n01:39:35,861 --> 01:39:37,510\n>> Yep.\n\n1855\n01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:38,160\nYeah.\n\n1856\n01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:42,740\nSo those were kind of the big ones that\nwe actually have in terms of the policy,\n\n1857\n01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:46,290\nnot actually applying there.\n\n1858\n01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:50,160\nSo we can always be able to view\nin this in the modeling wizard,\n\n1859\n01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:52,260\nin the results wizard.\n\n1860\n01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,422\nIf we don't see a policy\napplying that we expect to see,\n\n1861\n01:39:54,422 --> 01:39:56,265\nthen we know something\nis actually happening.\n\n1862\n01:39:56,265 --> 01:40:01,203\nNow, we want to talk about some of the\nother things as well, just briefly here.\n\n1863\n01:40:01,203 --> 01:40:05,480\nSo what are some of the causes\nof the policy not applying?\n\n1864\n01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:10,720\nAnd this is where Nate, was going with the\nidea of the process, in what we're doing.\n\n1865\n01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:15,400\nSo sometimes you have a policy\nthat you believe should apply, but\n\n1866\n01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,140\nthere's a process to the way\nthat policy is applied.\n\n1867\n01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:21,050\nSo in other words,\nwhat if you have contradictory policies?\n\n1868\n01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:26,030\nSo you have one that says hey,\ndon't allow for this to happen, and\n\n1869\n01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:28,870\nyou have another one that says hey,\nallow for this to happen.\n\n1870\n01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:32,810\nWell, it depends on when or\nwhere it actually is applied.\n\n1871\n01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:35,160\nSo Nate mentioned a ticker\nprocessing order,\n\n1872\n01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:39,330\ncomputer policies pretty much apply.\n\n1873\n01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:42,920\nSo if you actually set something\nup on the local group policy,\n\n1874\n01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:46,140\nit is going to apply, no matter what.\n\n1875\n01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:49,960\nBut what if now,\nin the active directory group policy,\n\n1876\n01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,930\nyou have it actually applying\nat a different level?\n\n1877\n01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:56,260\nSuch as the idea of a site or\na domain level?\n\n1878\n01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:59,350\nWell, it's actually about\nthe last one that applies.\n\n1879\n01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:06,660\nSo the order is local, site, domain, and\nthen another organization we call an OU.\n\n1880\n01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:10,860\nSo it actually applies in that order.\n\n1881\n01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:15,180\nLocal applies first, then site,\nthen domain, and then OU.\n\n1882\n01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:18,520\nSo if I have one policy that\napplies at the local level.\n\n1883\n01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:24,460\nBut then, I have the same policy with\ndifferent settings applying in the domain.\n\n1884\n01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:26,000\nWhich one's gonna apply, Nate?\n\n1885\n01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,600\n>> Well, the one on the domain.\n\n1886\n01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,870\n>> Yeah, the one on the domain.\n\n1887\n01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:30,955\nIt's not because it's more powerful,\neven though it is.\n\n1888\n01:41:30,955 --> 01:41:34,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's because it was applied last.\n\n1889\n01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:36,930\nSo it's whichever one's\napplied last that will happen.\n\n1890\n01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:41,470\nSo if it's contradictory, so you think\nI set this one up on the local, but\n\n1891\n01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:45,020\nNate went into the domain and\nhe set up that same policy and\n\n1892\n01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:46,670\nhe had a contradicting line.\n\n1893\n01:41:46,670 --> 01:41:48,960\nNate's policy would override mine.\n\n1894\n01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:53,450\nSo those are things that you can\nalso have to actually understand,\n\n1895\n01:41:53,450 --> 01:41:57,550\nis there another policy\nthat could override mine?\n\n1896\n01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:58,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n1897\n01:41:58,370 --> 01:41:59,599\nNow.\n\n1898\n01:41:59,599 --> 01:42:04,417\nYeah. Sweet. Now, the last objective\n[COUGH] that is cut out is\n\n1899\n01:42:04,417 --> 01:42:07,210\nGroup Policy Caching.\n\n1900\n01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:10,250\nA Group Policy Caching,\nnow it's intended for\n\n1901\n01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,843\na like a performance to help out-\n>> Increase.\n\n1902\n01:42:12,843 --> 01:42:13,946\n>> And to increase the performance.\n\n1903\n01:42:13,946 --> 01:42:15,270\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n1904\n01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:15,970\n>> Yep.\n\n1905\n01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:19,780\nYeah, for us in terms of Group Policy\nCache, every time that we ask you to log\n\n1906\n01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:24,260\nin or my Computer reboots,\nit's gonna pull those policies out.\n\n1907\n01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:25,760\nSo that makes sense.\n\n1908\n01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,820\nNow, if there's a lot of policies,\nthat can take a long time.\n\n1909\n01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:33,120\nTo actually pull down to apply,\nwhether they're user settings or\n\n1910\n01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,460\nwhether they're computer settings.\n\n1911\n01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:36,520\nIt depends on where you are in location.\n\n1912\n01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,540\nIs this a slow connection or not?\n\n1913\n01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:43,080\nIt can take a long time for Nate,\nto just get logged into the computer.\n\n1914\n01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:49,290\nBut with Windows 8.1, they do what\nthey call Group Policy Caching.\n\n1915\n01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:55,480\nAnd I think this is a default, that's\non in 8.1, where what they can say is,\n\n1916\n01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:58,810\nhey the first time that you do it,\nit's gonna take a long time.\n\n1917\n01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:03,080\nBut then from that from point, it's\ngonna cache it on that local machine, so\n\n1918\n01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:05,940\nthat now when Nate logs in again,\ninstead of actually go and\n\n1919\n01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:07,970\napply everything,\nit just checks and verifies.\n\n1920\n01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:10,340\nYep, Nate's the person he says he is.\n\n1921\n01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:12,860\nLet's go ahead, and have those\npolicies applied from the local cache.\n\n1922\n01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:18,210\nNow, this can be beneficial,\nbut is not always beneficial.\n\n1923\n01:43:18,210 --> 01:43:22,850\nBut it does actually make things work\na little bit faster, is what it does.\n\n1924\n01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:28,720\n>> Now, in the event log, in the event log\nit will [COUGH] say in there whether or\n\n1925\n01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:33,360\nnot a particular policy was\napplied from the cache or not.\n\n1926\n01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:38,797\nSo that's one place that you go to,\ncheck to see if that has been happened.\n\n1927\n01:43:38,797 --> 01:43:39,562\n>> Yeah.\n\n1928\n01:43:39,562 --> 01:43:41,520\nLet's take a look at that\ngroup policy setting.\n\n1929\n01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,040\nDo we have that here?\n\n1930\n01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,220\nHow we can verify that it's on?\n\n1931\n01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,940\nLet me see, if I can find it.\n\n1932\n01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:51,840\n>> Yeah, you can jump in at GP edit,\nwe can go look at it through there.\n\n1933\n01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,521\n>> Oops.\n[SOUND] Let me get that back up.\n\n1934\n01:43:54,521 --> 01:44:03,614\n>> And Computer Config > Administrative\nTemplates > System > Group Policy.\n\n1935\n01:44:03,614 --> 01:44:06,870\nAnd-\n>> And\n\n1936\n01:44:06,870 --> 01:44:12,347\nthis one is under the looking for\ncaching- Configure groups,\n\n1937\n01:44:12,347 --> 01:44:18,250\nlet's sort that by name there,\nand configure Group Policy Cache.\n\n1938\n01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,009\n>> There it is.\n>> Um-hm.\n\n1939\n01:44:21,009 --> 01:44:23,307\n>> And\nnotice that it says it's not configured.\n\n1940\n01:44:23,307 --> 01:44:26,605\nIf it's not configured that doesn't\nmean it's enables but believe it or\n\n1941\n01:44:26,605 --> 01:44:28,903\nnot that does actually mean it's working,\nokay?\n\n1942\n01:44:28,903 --> 01:44:33,550\nSo if you enable or do not configure\nthis Group Policy Cache information\n\n1943\n01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:37,720\nafter every background policy\nset change that we have.\n\n1944\n01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:39,734\nSo, that means it is working, okay?\n\n1945\n01:44:39,734 --> 01:44:44,000\nNow, it has happened in a certain order\nthere are again like it talks out here,\n\n1946\n01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,100\nbackground processing sessions and other\nthings that are here, but a lot of times\n\n1947\n01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:54,960\nfor us this is what really does make this\nthe computer, the network I should say.\n\n1948\n01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:59,949\nThe network has a ton of policies that\nare there to allow individual users to be\n\n1949\n01:44:59,949 --> 01:45:04,711\nable to log into a computer workstation\nrelatively quickly, rather than\n\n1950\n01:45:04,711 --> 01:45:09,390\ntaking forever and a day to do that,\nto have that apply, cuz there are big\n\n1951\n01:45:09,390 --> 01:45:14,534\norganizations which can have a ton of\npolicies apply to an individual himself or\n\n1952\n01:45:14,534 --> 01:45:19,266\njust to that organization, and\nit can take minutes to log on, minutes.\n\n1953\n01:45:19,266 --> 01:45:24,404\n>> Yeah, now, with group policy and\nhow they are applied or\n\n1954\n01:45:24,404 --> 01:45:29,620\nenforced or blocked or\ninherited, it is a huge topic.\n\n1955\n01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:34,400\nNow these, what we covered here is\njust a scratch on the surface on\n\n1956\n01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:39,610\nhow policy is rolled out,\nhow it is managed, how it affects PCs.\n\n1957\n01:45:39,610 --> 01:45:43,450\nFrom a client's point of view,\nthose few tools that we talked about\n\n1958\n01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:46,840\ncan determine whether or\nnot those policies have been applied.\n\n1959\n01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:49,040\nNow in the server exams,\n\n1960\n01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:53,770\nwe dive deep down into the nitty\ngritty on everything policy.\n\n1961\n01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:56,930\nSo even if you want to know more\nabout it or more questions or-\n\n1962\n01:45:56,930 --> 01:45:57,915\n>> Yeah, check out those sources.\n\n1963\n01:45:57,915 --> 01:45:58,774\n>> Yeah, anything, yeah.\n\n1964\n01:45:58,774 --> 01:46:04,380\nAnd jump into the server shows and\nget a lot more in depth in policy stuff.\n\n1965\n01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:08,965\n>> Yeah, and from your standpoint as\na support technician for Windows 8.1,\n\n1966\n01:46:08,965 --> 01:46:13,750\nright, you have to be able to at least\nunderstand the basics of the tool and\n\n1967\n01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:16,910\nunderstand that processing\norder that takes place, and\n\n1968\n01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:20,505\nsome things that can get in the way of\nthose policies getting push out, right?\n\n1969\n01:46:20,505 --> 01:46:21,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1970\n01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:22,400\n>> Okay.\n>> So, everything that we've done,\n\n1971\n01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:27,510\npretty much, for this entire episode\nis about the idea of making things work\n\n1972\n01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:30,730\nin the way that we want them to work,\nrather than the way\n\n1973\n01:46:30,730 --> 01:46:34,340\nthat Ronnie as an individual user\nchooses to make them work as well.\n\n1974\n01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:37,680\nSo we're actually talking about\nthe ideas of compliance here, right?\n\n1975\n01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:42,410\nSo we started off the episode by\nbeing able to control updating,\n\n1976\n01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:46,380\nwhich I wasn't gonna be able to say again,\nand then we took a look at the idea of\n\n1977\n01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:50,235\nWindows Defender or the antivirus\nin protecting our computers here.\n\n1978\n01:46:50,235 --> 01:46:52,780\n>> Um-hm.\n>> We also took a look at\n\n1979\n01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:57,440\nInternet Explorer 11,\nI wasn't gonna remember that one here.\n\n1980\n01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:01,690\nAnd then lastly, some of\nthe different things that you can use\n\n1981\n01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:06,693\nas a desktop technician here to\nhelp us to be able to troubleshoot\n\n1982\n01:47:06,693 --> 01:47:09,570\na little bit of whether group\npolicy is applying or not, and\n\n1983\n01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:11,950\nsome of the different things\nthat can happen there as well.\n\n1984\n01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:12,760\n>> Um-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1985\n01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:13,600\n>> Yep.\n\n1986\n01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,800\nAll right, well, if you

Nathan Copeland here with Ronny Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,360\n>> How's it going, Nate?\n\n5\n00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,920\n>> Pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,590\n>> Yes?\n\n7\n00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,590\n>> Yes, good.\n\n8\n00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,075\n>> Have you beat your own high\nscore on what, Dance, Revolution?\n\n9\n00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,620\n>> [LAUGH] Have I?\n\n10\n00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,500\n>> Yes?\n\n11\n00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,565\nNo okay.\n\n12\n00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No you still have the high score.\n\n13\n00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,968\n>> Well apparently I do, yeah.\n\n14\n00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:56,076\n>> [CROSSTALK] One of these days\nI'm gonna, I'm gonna beat you.\n\n15\n00:00:56,076 --> 00:00:58,400\n>> It is because I'm light on my toes.\n\n16\n00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,510\n>> You are.\n>> I can keep the beat.\n\n17\n00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,150\n>> I know.\nYeah, you hold onto that,\n\n18\n00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,330\nto the counter top so you can just\nlike skip around a whole bunch.\n\n19\n00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,230\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n20\n00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,040\n>> It is.\n\n21\n00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,780\n>> That's sweet.\n>> That's good.\n\n22\n00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,400\n>> That's sweet.\n\n23\n00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,440\n>> I mean the technique.\n\n24\n00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,070\nI can't beat that yet.\n\n25\n00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,860\n>> But one thing I can beat is in tune.\n\n27\n00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,890\n>> In tune.\n\n28\n00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,200\n>> I guess, I don't know.\n\n29\n00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,130\n>> Wow, what a segway?\n\n30\n00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,969\n>> It's kind of a stretch,\n[CROSSTALK] but I was good for it.\n\n31\n00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,889\nSo today, we are going over 70-688, and\n\n32\n00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:26,663\nthe official objective\nas we scroll on down,\n\n33\n00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:31,630\nI'm gonna skip a little bit of this stuff\nIn the middle to get to some neat things.\n\n34\n00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,150\nSo this is gonna fall under\nsupport Windows clients and\n\n35\n00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,300\ndevices, and specifically, number four,\n\n36\n00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,700\nmanage clients by using Windows intune and\nthe photo things under there.\n\n37\n00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,310\nSo, we got computer groups and\nmonitoring and policies.\n\n38\n00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,890\nAnd remote computers.\n\n39\n00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n40\n00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,960\n>> Now in terms of what intune actually\nis right, you might've actually all ready\n\n41\n00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,600\nheard about it you may not have, just as\na brief overview for us, that we have.\n\n42\n00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,890\nIn a lot of organizations one of\nthe things that we do have an issue with\n\n43\n00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:07,600\nis controlling the devices that\nget connect into our network.\n\n44\n00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,550\nSo we can use intune as\na way to kind of extend out,\n\n45\n00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,550\nthe control that we have other, over\ndevices that are not inside of our network\n\n46\n00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,510\nhere by using a cloud manage\nservice to help us out.\n\n47\n00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,970\nSo, intune is a product from Microsoft,\nand\n\n48\n00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,620\nthey already built up\nthe infrastructure for us.\n\n49\n00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,390\nSo that what we can do is have devices\nthat are outside of our network here, and\n\n50\n00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,370\nthey are going to access\nresources inside our network.\n\n51\n00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,380\nAnd we want to be able to control them,\nand in tune offers us a way to do that,\n\n52\n00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,240\nnot only with devices, but even users.\n\n53\n00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,756\n>> Yeah, you know, in intune it's\nessentially like a baby system center.\n\n54\n00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:45,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, so, I mean, system center,\n\n55\n00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,830\nvery complex, right, you know\n>> The most complex software that we have.\n\n56\n00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,810\n>> Yeah, very complex.\n\n57\n00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,415\nNo, intune it in a sense,\nit can sort of do the same things,\n\n58\n00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:00,200\nbut on a much simpler scale.\n\n59\n00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,610\nEasier to roll out, easier to manage.\n\n60\n00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,490\nI mean, I guess if Roy and I can roll out,\nintune, right, they can't be that bad.\n\n61\n00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,290\nYeah?\n>> That's right.\n\n62\n00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,090\n>> Yeah.\n\n63\n00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,836\n>> Yeah.\nSo it, but intune,\n\n64\n00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:12,150\nI mean manage people's computers.\n\n65\n00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,610\nYou're gonna roll out software with it,\n\n66\n00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,900\nlink the things you can integrate active\ndirectory into it an amazing platform.\n\n67\n00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,450\nI've grown to be a real big fan of it and\nyeah,\n\n68\n00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,470\nlooking forward to going\nover with it today.\n\n69\n00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,200\n>> Yeah, so one of the things that we do\nhave to understand a lot of times is that\n\n70\n00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,800\nif your organization or\nbusiness is considering the use of intune.\n\n71\n00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,900\nThat means that you as\nan MCSA in Windows 8 need\n\n72\n00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,570\nto be at least be familiar with\nthe technology of intune here.\n\n73\n00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,880\nEspecially about the idea of helping\nus to create user groups and\n\n74\n00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,550\nalso of course the adding in computers\nin intune, and even possibly\n\n75\n00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,110\nadding in policies and managing other\nremote things that we actually have to do.\n\n76\n00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,654\nSo, we do wanna take\na look at intune here.\n\n77\n00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:56,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n78\n00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,160\nNow, we can set up the the the PCs.\n\n79\n00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,840\nWe won't be doing this here today, but\n\n80\n00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,570\nwe can set up a active\ndirectory synchronization.\n\n81\n00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,065\nAnd so the user counts that we create.\n\n82\n00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:06,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right,\n\n83\n00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,660\nwill automatically sync\nup to Windows Intune.\n\n84\n00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,460\nWe can go that way, or,\nwe can manually create\n\n85\n00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,800\nthese accounts within Windows Intune\nwhich today as well as we'll be doing.\n\n86\n00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,310\n>> Yeah.\nNow you might be thinking,\n\n87\n00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,710\nlike well, where,\nwhere in the world do I get access?\n\n88\n00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,940\nThe good thing is Microsoft is very\ngenerous right now, and they are giving\n\n89\n00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,470\neveryone, okay, a free 30 day trial,\nso that you can actually go ahead and\n\n90\n00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,560\ntake a look at it and\nsee if it's actually right for you.\n\n91\n00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,570\nand so you can go and create your own\naccount and actually start to Try and\n\n92\n00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,210\nuse it right then and\nmakes it fairly easy for you to do so.\n\n93\n00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,380\nRelatively easy, I should say,\n\n94\n00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,562\nyou have to pick out a domain name\nwhich may be the hardest one.\n\n95\n00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:44,646\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like, you know,\n\n96\n00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:49,220\nI tried to do like test.com and apparently\nthat had been used like 64,000 and.\n\n97\n00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,085\n>> Oh right.\n>> So yeah.\n\n98\n00:04:50,085 --> 00:04:51,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n99\n00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,050\n>> Yeah, well, you know, yeah,\nso, so there's that 30 day trial.\n\n100\n00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,820\nAnd if you choose to keep Windows Intune,\nto roll out or test even further or\n\n101\n00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,390\nsomething like that, it's gonna run you $6\nper device enrolled in Intune per month.\n\n102\n00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,420\n>> Yeah, and so you might find out and\n\n103\n00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,960\ngo, that's a little bit too\n>> Too expensive but again depending on\n\n104\n00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,000\nyour organization you may take a look and\ndecide that it is worth it.\n\n105\n00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,910\nBut, at this point we wanna make sure that\nyou actually understand at least the basic\n\n106\n00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,180\nfunctionality of it.\n\n107\n00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,560\nAnd so that if you are actually\nhelping to manage a network\n\n108\n00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,730\nby using this that you at least\nhave the idea of what to do.\n\n109\n00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,390\n>> Yeah, now with what is in tune, right?\n\n110\n00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,740\n>> And we can,\nwe can managing and control, and\n\n111\n00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,550\nget reports on a number\nof different things.\n\n112\n00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,270\nWe can get you know,\nin point protection updates.\n\n113\n00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,950\n>> Right.\n>> You know,\n\n114\n00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,700\nroll out system software updates.\n\n115\n00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,760\nWe can manage mobile devices.\n\n116\n00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,750\nYou know, enroll computers and\nrun you know, malware scans with them,\n\n117\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,262\nall sorts of things now.\n\n118\n00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,770\nToday though,\nwe're just gonna focus on the, you know,\n\n119\n00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,150\nthe four little items that\nwe talked about earlier.\n\n120\n00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n121\n00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,030\nSo, lets start off here with the idea\nof talking about managing users and\n\n122\n00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,620\ncomputers.\n\n123\n00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,370\nNow, we have already created\nan actual in tune account for us, and\n\n124\n00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,030\nit's just a generic one that I created for\n\n125\n00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,590\nour show at this point here,\nwhat we want to do of course is then.\n\n126\n00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,240\nTo show you how to actually\nbe able to add in a user.\n\n127\n00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,390\nAnd also how to add in a computer.\n\n128\n00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,060\nAnd we've got these kinda stage\na little bit differently as well, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,790\nSo, let me go ahead and\n\n130\n00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,050\nshow you what I'm talking about\nhere in terms of intake, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,878\nSo, once you actually get set up with-\n>> You want to can you check your\n\n132\n00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:29,715\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> Did it die out again?\n\n133\n00:06:29,715 --> 00:06:30,528\nSure did.\n\n134\n00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,166\n>> So.\n\n135\n00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,605\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n136\n00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,498\n>> We may have it up.\n\n137\n00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:39,540\n>> Yeah, our screen sharing software,\nif you've seen a number of our,\n\n138\n00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,360\nearlier episodes with our screen share\nsoftware has a mind of its own sometimes.\n\n139\n00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,970\nIs it connecting up?\n\n140\n00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,380\n>> It says it is.\n\n141\n00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,750\n>> Yep.\n\n142\n00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,320\nThere we go.\n>> All right, we're up.\n\n143\n00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,030\nAll right.\n\n144\n00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,740\nSo here it is.\n\n145\n00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,250\nI already went ahead and\nset up the account.\n\n146\n00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,940\n>> And when you do so that actually\nbrings you in to your page and\n\n147\n00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,150\nyou can see here it is, I'm logged in.\n\n148\n00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,730\nAnd when you first get set up you\nactually notice that it kind of gives you\n\n149\n00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,910\nhate to say that a basic wizard, right?\n\n150\n00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,840\nYou want to start here in\nterms of what you want to do.\n\n151\n00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,130\nAnd so one of the first things we would\nwant to do is actually create an account.\n\n152\n00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,370\nNow, in terms that it's already\ncreated several accounts for us, but\n\n153\n00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,760\nwe can go ahead and\ndo the same thing here to do that.\n\n154\n00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,570\nNow, if I go and select add users, that\nwill then bring me into this account where\n\n155\n00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,290\nits, it says, apparently I have,\nI probably have timed out.\n\n156\n00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,070\nLet me get logged back in here, okay?\n\n157\n00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,400\nSo, once actually click on that,\n\n158\n00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,990\nnotice that it gives me the ability\nnow to create a new user.\n\n159\n00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,435\nAnd I can't remember,\nwe'll pick on West today.\n\n160\n00:07:41,435 --> 00:07:43,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n161\n00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,930\n>> Okay, now I went ahead and just clicked\non a name here and the username and\n\n162\n00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,400\nit's actually gonna come up with the name\nof the network that I created in\n\n163\n00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,320\nterms of intune, right?\n\n164\n00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,790\nSo test lab 10, 1001 and\nyou gotta be careful there.\n\n165\n00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,482\nThe on Microsoft.com is pretty much it.\n\n166\n00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:05,370\nThe more details you fill out now, you\nknow the better it's gonna be later on.\n\n167\n00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,286\nInstead of yes,\nyou have to go back and fill it in.\n\n168\n00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,290\nBut we're not gonna fill in any of these\nother details, for right now of course.\n\n169\n00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,590\n>> Oh, and then put in a username.\n\n170\n00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,180\n>> Oh, yeah I forgot all about that.\n\n171\n00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,910\nThere we go.\n\n172\n00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,080\nAnd then, it asked me right here, do I\nwanna actually give any particular type of\n\n173\n00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,090\npermissions in terms of\nadministrative roles or anything?\n\n174\n00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,800\nIf this is gonna be a standard user,\nprobably not.\n\n175\n00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,210\nBut if I wanted to, it's ready,\nof course has some prebuilt groups\n\n176\n00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,180\nthat we can actually add in\nhere at this point, okay.\n\n177\n00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,570\nSo, it goes from billing administrator\nto global administrator,\n\n178\n00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,680\npassword administrator.\n\n179\n00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,670\nService support administrator,\nand then user management as well.\n\n180\n00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,600\nAt this point,\nwe're just gonna create a simple account.\n\n181\n00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,240\nAnd then, we're gonna select the location\nof where that user's gonna be.\n\n182\n00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,410\nNow, some of this, it actually talks about\nthe idea of licensing restriction, so,\n\n183\n00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,110\nin other words, it's not the same for\nevery single country, so\n\n184\n00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,220\nwe're gonna put em right here.\n\n185\n00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,325\nAnd, the United States, cuz that's\nwhere he actually is, in the next room.\n\n186\n00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we do that.\n\n187\n00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,800\nAnd then here is the basic group that was\ncreated, which is just Windows Intune.\n\n188\n00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,680\nAnd you notice, I already had created\nthree or four accounts before this.\n\n189\n00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,860\nClick Next.\n\n190\n00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,848\nAnd now I could go ahead and\nsend them an email.\n\n191\n00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,830\nAnd I can just type in whatever\nemail that I want to in here, but\n\n192\n00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,950\nI'm just gonna go ahead and create one.\n\n193\n00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,450\nI'm just have it sent to me I don't\nwant to disturb him right now,\n\n194\n00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,500\ncuz I'm just using it as\na test account at this point.\n\n195\n00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,370\nUsually it generates at this\npoint a temporary password.\n\n196\n00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,350\n>> What is, yeah,\nwhat is that temp password?\n\n197\n00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,298\n>> It is [LAUGH] capitol COXO5553.\n\n198\n00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:41,990\n>> 'Kay.\nThere, in case we need it later.\n\n199\n00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,100\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n200\n00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,000\nSo it did get sent to my email,\nand now I've added in Wes here.\n\n201\n00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,190\nNow I've already created these other\naccounts for us here at ITProTV, so\n\n202\n00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,840\nthat we could used them if we wanted to,\nbut here it is.\n\n203\n00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,764\nSo there it is, I've just added Wes,\nright in there, okay.\n\n204\n00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,051\nAnd then at this point of course I\ncan go back and edit and do all of\n\n205\n00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:05,475\nthe other things that we actually need to,\nbut right now, that is as simple it gets.\n\n206\n00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:08,343\nNow, at this point, I have a user, so\n\n207\n00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:12,850\nthere anything else to do with the,\nthe user at this point?\n\n208\n00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,225\n>> You know you know, you know what,\nlet, let lets click on Wes's name\n\n209\n00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:17,232\n>> All right, let's go ahead and\n\n210\n00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:17,976\nclick on Wes's name.\n\n211\n00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:20,517\n>> Lets let's take a look at good ol Wes.\n\n212\n00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:22,494\nNow after we create, create the account.\n\n213\n00:10:22,494 --> 00:10:24,225\n[SOUND] Not a lot to do in,\nin that window, right?\n\n214\n00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:24,930\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n215\n00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,794\n>> So you know, after the fact we can\ngo in and edit some of his information\n\n216\n00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:33,248\nperhaps, you know, if we needed to put in\nhis home address for whatever reason we\n\n217\n00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:37,206\ncan go in there and, let's put on\nthe Settings tab, near the top.\n\n218\n00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:39,225\n>> Yeah.\n>> And in here, so after the fact,\n\n219\n00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:42,240\nif maybe Wes gets a promotion or\nsomething.\n\n220\n00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,983\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now we can assign him to those\n\n221\n00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:46,170\nthose group statuses, right there.\n\n222\n00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,335\nAnd from, and from here or just below\nthat we have the, Set sign-in status.\n\n223\n00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,488\nSo if we want to temporarily\ndisable Wes' account,\n\n224\n00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:57,071\nthen we can just turn that off\nright there, so then he will be\n\n225\n00:10:57,071 --> 00:11:01,602\nunable to log in or use any of his\nIntune services from that point.\n\n226\n00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:02,712\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Then, then,\n\n227\n00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:06,900\nI guess if Wes gets that crazy\npromotion and gets promoted to India.\n\n228\n00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,550\n>> There you go.\nYep, then we can change his location.\n\n229\n00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,710\n>> Then we can his his location in there.\n\n230\n00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,670\n>> Yeah\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n231\n00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,570\n>> Yeah, now for us to,\nto be able to apply different policies,\n\n232\n00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,310\nmaybe, we might also want to\ninclude him into a group.\n\n233\n00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,080\nNow at this point,\nwe don't actually have any groups.\n\n234\n00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,323\nSo, the only one he's included in is the\none that everybody else is just dumped in\n\n235\n00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:24,480\nat this point.\n\n236\n00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n237\n00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,820\nYeah, let, let's, let's create,\ncreate some groups.\n\n238\n00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,414\n>> All right.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n239\n00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:32,260\n>> Let me see, yep, need this page.\n\n240\n00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,656\nThere we go, 'kay.\n\n241\n00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:38,460\nSo here, I had went ahead and\ncreated just a couple of different groups,\n\n242\n00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,250\njust so that we could fill them in.\n\n243\n00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,340\nBut we can add in another one.\n\n244\n00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,016\nSo for, we'll click on New.\n\n245\n00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:48,138\nAnd what do we wanna call this group?\n\n246\n00:11:48,138 --> 00:11:52,641\n>> Let's call, [SOUND] yeah sales.\n\n247\n00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:54,210\nDo you already have a,\na sales, sales group in there?\n\n248\n00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,310\n>> I do not.\n>> All right.\n\n249\n00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,000\nSales group.\n\n250\n00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,660\nWe'll put Wes in, in sales.\n\n251\n00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,960\n>> Here we go.\n\n252\n00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,300\nAll right, so now that I've created\nthe sales group now I can go back in and\n\n253\n00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,740\nactually add in who I'd also\nlike to be in this bigger group.\n\n254\n00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,558\nAnd we're just gonna add Wes in here.\n\n255\n00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,430\nMaybe, if I can actually click on him.\n\n256\n00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,062\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n257\n00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:19,947\nthat now has actually added Wes right in.\n\n258\n00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n259\n00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,970\n>> And let's see there,\nis there an apply button down here?\n\n260\n00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,100\nOh, there is.\n\n261\n00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,580\nSave and close, gotta save and close.\n\n262\n00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,420\nAnd there we go.\n\n263\n00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,748\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, you know, I mean and\nheaven sakes there's not not really a,\n\n264\n00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:34,540\na whole lot to it.\n\n265\n00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,300\nYou know, creating those,\nthose users in those groups.\n\n266\n00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,145\nYou know, and, and while we're right here.\n\n267\n00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:39,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n268\n00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,050\n>> You know, we can see up towards the\ntop, the active directory synchronization.\n\n269\n00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,790\nClicking on the, on that so\nwe can go and, and and\n\n270\n00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,395\nthere's a link there that we can\nsetup our, our synchronization.\n\n271\n00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And it gives a, a list of you know,\n\n272\n00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,730\nsteps to follow.\n\n273\n00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,915\nYou know, there is a like\nanother little like portal.\n\n274\n00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Portal package that's downloaded.\n\n275\n00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,550\nAnd you install it onto the,\nthe main controller.\n\n276\n00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,650\nAnd then it will then sync up and\nyou can enable the synchronization for\n\n277\n00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,720\nyour active directory.\n\n278\n00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> And, yeah.\n\n279\n00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,680\n>> Takes a little while, but\n\n280\n00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,820\nthen once it's all synced up and\nready to go, that is the key.\n\n281\n00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,160\nSo, if you are actually running an active\ndirectory domain and wanna see how this\n\n282\n00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,750\ncan also work in terms of synchronizing\nwith Intune accounts, there you got it.\n\n283\n00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,490\n>> All right, now let you know, let's,\n\n284\n00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,530\nlet's click on the domains little\nbutton there under security groups.\n\n285\n00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,125\nNow, now on here, so right now we\nhave just the one domain, all right.\n\n286\n00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,399\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Our testlab1001.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n287\n00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,725\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now, by adding another domain, right,\n\n288\n00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:38,750\nso this, this domain, this would be our,\nour, our work, our work domain, right.\n\n289\n00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,034\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n290\n00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:45,116\nYou know, yeah, in a previous, previous\none is Intune, we added I have this\n\n291\n00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,556\nlittle test lab that I run and practice\nwith called the chickabow network.\n\n292\n00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,245\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah and we added in the,\n\n293\n00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:55,729\nthe chickabow domain on here and it, and\nit's synced up to that existing lab,\n\n294\n00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:58,375\notherwise we put it in,\ninto this guy here.\n\n295\n00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:02,638\nBut, yeah, following these steps we\ncan add that, that in there and so\n\n296\n00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:05,336\nwe can add multiple domains into,\none is Intune and\n\n297\n00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:08,380\nbuild a managed across,\nacross all those domains.\n\n298\n00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,940\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty, pretty slick stuff.\n\n299\n00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n300\n00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,436\n>> So once we have this though,\n'kay, it really un,\n\n301\n00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:19,050\nuntil the user actually\nis able to get access in,\n\n302\n00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,200\nwe really can't apply the policies or we\nreally can't control the user very easily,\n\n303\n00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,900\nin terms of giving them access to\nthe resources that we want to.\n\n304\n00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,760\nSo what we actually have\nto also do of course,\n\n305\n00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,695\nthen, is talk about the idea of adding\nin a computer for a user to use, right.\n\n306\n00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:34,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n307\n00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so so adding,\n\n308\n00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,695\nadding a PC, all right,\nso, so we've got Wes.\n\n309\n00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,360\n>> Mm-hm. [CROSSTALK] >> All right,\nWes is in there.\n\n310\n00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,190\nAnd now let's let's add a computer for,\nfor Wes.\n\n311\n00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,890\n>> All right.\n>> Now, a few different ways that we,\n\n312\n00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,245\nwe can load, load this on.\n\n313\n00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you know what let's,\n\n314\n00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,907\nso, across the top right, so\nthere's kind of grayed out links.\n\n315\n00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:53,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We have company portal,\n\n316\n00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,370\nwe have an admin console, and\nright now we are in the, just, admin,\n\n317\n00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,940\nwhich is the accounts portals.\n\n318\n00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,025\n>> Yeah.\nIs my page up?\n\n319\n00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:00,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n320\n00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,860\nYeah, let's click on the admin console.\n\n321\n00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,520\nAll right so we've got like, like two\ndifferent portals for, for Windows Intune.\n\n322\n00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,620\nWe had the page that we were just on,\nright, the account portal.\n\n323\n00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,540\nAnd this is like the,\nthe main administration page.\n\n324\n00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,640\nThe like the real low level stuff where\nwe can, you know, add those users,\n\n325\n00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,390\nadd those groups,\nset up the synchronization.\n\n326\n00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,600\nAnd then now we have this portal,\nright, the administrative portal.\n\n327\n00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,737\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And this is where,\n\n328\n00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:30,380\nif you have service administrators or\nread only administrators,\n\n329\n00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,940\nthis is the portal where they would\ngo to you know to, huh, dropped out.\n\n330\n00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,470\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, so that's the portal they,\n\n331\n00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,600\nthey would go to and\nyou know where there's just,\n\n332\n00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,540\nlike, the real meat of of Windows Intune.\n\n333\n00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,780\nYou can check on the reports and\nthe status and your,\n\n334\n00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,600\nyour assets, and, yeah, everything else.\n\n335\n00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,830\nEndpoint protection and,\nthose good things in there.\n\n336\n00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,992\nNow let, let's see what,\noh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n337\n00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:56,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And rolling, rolling devices.\n\n338\n00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,756\n>> Yep.\n\n339\n00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,436\n>> All right, so and, oh yeah?\n\n340\n00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:01,098\n>> No, no.\n\n341\n00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,635\nSo right here,\nwhat we're actually seeing here, right,\n\n342\n00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:05,268\nin our particular overview, right.\n\n343\n00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,609\nIn Windows in tune, it is already\nseeing that the system status,\n\n344\n00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:12,970\nwe don't have any of this stuff set up and\nthat's why there's no issues here.\n\n345\n00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,320\nBut notice right now, we only have one\ncomputer that's all ready signed up.\n\n346\n00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,900\nWe don't have any mobile\ndevices that are connecting in.\n\n347\n00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,560\nSo in one instance,\nout on the internet, right?\n\n348\n00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,615\nI'm connecting right out to Microsoft.\n\n349\n00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:27,430\nThey can actually see devices that\nwe have already connected in, and\n\n350\n00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,530\nfrom there I can even manage\nthat device to a point.\n\n351\n00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,558\nNow, before we do that,\nright, like I said,\n\n352\n00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:38,078\nwe actually have to go ahead and\nset up a device on here as well, okay?\n\n353\n00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:40,060\nSo is that what we want to do next here?\n\n354\n00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,600\nYou want to, take it?\n\n355\n00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,560\nAre you logged in?\n\n356\n00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,610\nReady to?\n\n357\n00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,370\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n358\n00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,320\nPoor little guys.\n>> All right.\n\n359\n00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,070\n>> Syncing up right now.\n\n360\n00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:53,390\nAll right, so what we're going to\ndo is yeah, she noticed that over\n\n361\n00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,480\nhere on the left-hand side there's this\nkind of sidebar that we have right here,\n\n362\n00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,440\nand we hover over it we get\nthese screen tips for us.\n\n363\n00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,120\nAnd if I go ahead

Yes.\n\n534\n00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:14,525\n>> Cross City, right?\n\n535\n00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:17,435\nOkay and then we have the,\nthe Cross City group of computers,\n\n536\n00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:22,372\nthat's, those ones would\nprobably be the Nevermind.\n\n537\n00:25:22,372 --> 00:25:23,582\n>> Nathan's being mean.\n\n538\n00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:26,882\n>> So, for this PC I installed here,\n\n539\n00:25:26,882 --> 00:25:30,432\nI didn't add it to any\ndevice as grouped yet.\n\n540\n00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:35,740\nSo it's under here, and ungrouped devices\n\"Then we see in total devices we have one,\n\n541\n00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,350\nlowly, little machine, and\nclicking on that guy, that'll\n\n542\n00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,630\nbring up to the,oh, look that!- here's\nthe message, it just barely installed.\n\n543\n00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,730\n>> It, just did\n>> Yeah, I see it.\n\n544\n00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,760\nCO1.\n\n545\n00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,150\npopped up.\n\n546\n00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,650\n>> There it is.\n\n547\n00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:57,360\n>> Now with so after you install\nthe little in tune client software,\n\n548\n00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,532\nit does take some time for\nthe PC to report in with everything and\n\n549\n00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:08,800\nI guess get all of it's little policies\npushed out to it and start talking.\n\n550\n00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,580\nAnd like on mine here, so\nI connected this one before the show.\n\n551\n00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,500\nWe'll double click on this guy and\none thing,\n\n552\n00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,670\nI think is very cool about Windows InTune\nis the reporting that it does.\n\n553\n00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:27,771\nSo up along the top we have this Hardware\ntab and yes, okay, so it has synched.\n\n554\n00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:30,280\nCool,all right.\n\n555\n00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,720\nOn this tab right here,\nthis lists everything on the PC.\n\n556\n00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:41,380\nSo, for goodness sakes, I think you\neven have the BIOS revision stuff,\n\n557\n00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,680\nand the numbers just about\neverything about the PC and\n\n558\n00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,350\nright next to it is the software tab.\n\n559\n00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,910\nAnd this,\noh okay this one hasn't reported in yet.\n\n560\n00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,910\nThis will list all the software\nthat has installed on the computer\n\n561\n00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,330\nboth managed software and\nunmanaged software.\n\n562\n00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,570\nSo unmanaged stuff, things that\nwere already included on the PC so\n\n563\n00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,200\nthen All of our modern UI style stuff,\n\n564\n00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,310\nso all that neat things in\nthere will appear on that list.\n\n565\n00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,100\nAnd, then any other apps\nthat we push out through\n\n566\n00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,300\nWindows Intune-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n567\n00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,040\n>> Which I believe we'll be getting.\n\n568\n00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,100\nYeah, somewhere around in here.\n\n569\n00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,950\n>> Yup.\n>> We'll yeah,\n\n570\n00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,300\nwe'll talk about wrapping packages up.\n\n571\n00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,070\nAnd or software in the packages and\npushing that stuff out.\n\n572\n00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,870\n>> Yeah.\n\n573\n00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,160\nNow, it says my computer\nhas just joined in here\n\n574\n00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,440\non the actual computer page itself\nwhere Nate was just showing us.\n\n575\n00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,910\nUnderneath all devices and\nall computers here.\n\n576\n00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,440\nIf you right click on\nthat particular computer,\n\n577\n00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,870\nnotice what you can actually\ndo to this thing, okay?\n\n578\n00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,720\nWe're gonna link a user amount because\nthat's where we actually really do find\n\n579\n00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,900\nthe grouping and\nthe power that we actually need.\n\n580\n00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,990\nWe can create a group\nfrom within that section.\n\n581\n00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,950\nHey, look at that, retire and wife,\n[LAUGH] okay, is what you can do.\n\n582\n00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,350\nRun a full malware scan at this point.\n\n583\n00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,405\nI can even remotely restart\nthe actual computer from Windows NT.\n\n584\n00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:05,230\nSo if I believe that a user is actually\nneeding to restart their computer.\n\n585\n00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,077\nWhoops, I don't wanna do that.\n\n586\n00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:10,505\n[LAUGH] I can actually do that,\nI probably could have.\n\n587\n00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:12,300\n>> [INAUDIBLE] your connection, you're-\n>> Oh I did it.\n\n588\n00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,800\nThere it goes.\n\n589\n00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,520\n[CROSSTALK] So again it's been\nawhile since this has happened but\n\n590\n00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,820\nsometimes you just have to deal with\nthe technology as it comes along here.\n\n591\n00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,440\nSo I don't know what's\nhappened on my computer it's\n\n592\n00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,040\nkind of flaking out a little bit.\n\n593\n00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,450\n>> Maybe intune's taking over.\n\n594\n00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,120\n>> Yeah, could be intune's taking over.\n\n595\n00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,690\n>> Could be.\n\n596\n00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,870\n>> And so you actually see a lot of\ndifferent things that you can actually\n\n597\n00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,813\nview right here immediately\nat this bigger point.\n\n598\n00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,671\n>> Mm.\nYeah.\n\n599\n00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:36,238\n>> Yeah.\n\n600\n00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:42,830\nPretty see stuff, the things that\nwe can do with these computers,\n\n601\n00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,100\nand of course a lot of this stuff for\nthose remote users, those\n\n602\n00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,100\nusers that are working from home are those\nroad warriors that are out of the office\n\n603\n00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,295\na whole lot to be able to manage their\ncomputer as they're away from the office.\n\n604\n00:28:55,295 --> 00:28:55,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n605\n00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,160\n>> Pretty, pretty sweet stuff.\n\n606\n00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,105\n>> It is impressive.\n\n607\n00:28:58,105 --> 00:28:59,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> By far\n\n608\n00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,330\nof all the things that we see here.\n\n609\n00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,730\nAnd mine has not yet\ncompletely updated yet.\n\n610\n00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,210\nYou see it's not reporting\nthe operating system.\n\n611\n00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,350\nAnd the update here.\n\n612\n00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:14,660\nSo once everything is done at that point\nyou actually have a nice ready to go.\n\n613\n00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,520\n>> Mhmm.\n>> Yep.\n\n614\n00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520\n>> All right.\n\n615\n00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,270\nAll right well sweet.\n\n616\n00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,720\nWell we are coming up\nright up on break here.\n\n617\n00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,870\nWe do have do a couple\nof other items to get.\n\n618\n00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,385\nToo with Windows Intune.\n\n619\n00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:25,790\n>> Right.\n>> So we will dive more into that stuff\n\n620\n00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,300\nafter the break.\n\n621\n00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,970\n>> Mhm.\n\n622\n00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:36,000\n[MUSIC]\n\n623\n00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,520\n>> All right welcome back.\n\n624\n00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,940\nAll right, so where we left off is we were\ntalking about the users and the groups.\n\n625\n00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,680\nWe got Ronnie connected up.\n\n626\n00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,960\nAnd with these in-tune center installed\non his virtual machine there.\n\n627\n00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,250\nAnd ready to get fired up.\n\n628\n00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,840\nSo now, lets link a person to a PC.\n\n629\n00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,850\n>> Yep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n630\n00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n631\n00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,900\nNow we're probably gonna, I'm gonna stick\nwith NATO since my IVGA keeps dropping out\n\n632\n00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,600\nhere in terms of what we're going to do.\n\n633\n00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,460\nBut, that is where we have to link\nan actual user that we have created into\n\n634\n00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,870\nan actual computer account.\n\n635\n00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,570\nAnd the good thing is,\n\n636\n00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:11,570\nwe have plenty of user accounts,\nwe have plenty of computer accounts.\n\n637\n00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,090\n>> Alright, alright.\n\n638\n00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,630\nSo, did you want me to go?\n\n639\n00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,270\n>> Yeah.\n\n640\n00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:15,890\n>> Alright.\n\n641\n00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,250\nSo, on my PC here, we've got.\n\n642\n00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,800\nSo, yeah,\nwe start out here in this overview panel,\n\n643\n00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,299\nand we'll go down to groups.\n\n644\n00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,700\nAnd da, da, da,\n\n645\n00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,830\nonce this guys refreshes up then we\ncan come down to computers, all right?\n\n646\n00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,390\nOh look.\n\n647\n00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,460\n>> Yeah, devices are now checking in.\n\n648\n00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,020\n>> Cool.\n>> And\n\n649\n00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,580\nyou can see where mine actually\nhas some different update statuses\n\n650\n00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,180\nthat are going on and\nwhat we actually need to do.\n\n651\n00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,360\nSo the good thing is those\ncomputers are reporting in exactly\n\n652\n00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,670\nwhat needs to be done.\n\n653\n00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,220\nYeah, 31 new updates Ronnie.\n\n654\n00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,790\n>> Yeah I know.\n\n655\n00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,050\n>> You don't update your machine?\n\n656\n00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,390\n>> No I don't.\n\n657\n00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,270\n>> Man.\n\n658\n00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,290\nMan, we need to remotely\nmanage your machine for sure.\n\n659\n00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:58,730\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n>> Alright let's go back to the,\n\n660\n00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,815\nall the computers here.\n\n661\n00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:01,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n662\n00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,370\n>> And get them all displayed.\n\n663\n00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,115\nAlright so here we have our, our PCs.\n\n664\n00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:06,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n665\n00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,500\nup at the top,\nwe have a little button here, link a user.\n\n666\n00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,790\n>> Right.\n>> [INAUDIBLE] So\n\n667\n00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,470\nyou wanna link me to mine and to yours?\n\n668\n00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,040\n>> Sure.\nThat sounds great.\n\n669\n00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,280\n>> All right, go on link user and so\nhere we go, and so now we just pick\n\n670\n00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,300\nwhich user that we want to link to\nthe computer that we had selected.\n\n671\n00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,190\nSo let's use my account here,\ndah dah dah, Click okay.\n\n672\n00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,605\nAlright, and that's it.\n\n673\n00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:35,680\n>> And you can actually see over on\nthe right, well, maybe you can't.\n\n674\n00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,320\n>> Oh yeah,\nlet's go full screen real quick.\n\n675\n00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,910\n>> In the lower right-hand corner,\nright underneath the general there,\n\n676\n00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,860\nyou'll see to the right of that,\nwhere it actually says the user\n\n677\n00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,485\nis now going to be Nathan on that machine,\nwhen we do that.\n\n678\n00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:48,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n679\n00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,160\n>> Now if we do the same thing with\nmine here what we actually need to pay\n\n680\n00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,660\nattention to is gonna be the dialog box\nthere that it says under the link user.\n\n681\n00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,918\n>> Yeah.\nIt looks like you're already linked.\n\n682\n00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,190\n>> Am I?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n683\n00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,100\n>> Well, there you go.\n\n684\n00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,725\nI'm already linked.\n\n685\n00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:02,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n686\n00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,320\n>> Now go ahead and just click on that\nlink user again cuz we may have actually\n\n687\n00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,820\njust kind of blown through what it said.\n\n688\n00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,995\nRight up there in the very\nfirst paragraph, right.\n\n689\n00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,902\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It says to link a different user to\n\n690\n00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:14,557\ncomputer, select a new user from\nthe list of

00:32:20,989\nWill replace One that's on there and\n\n694\n00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:25,610\nit says because a computer can be\nlinked only to one Windows Intune.\n\n695\n00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,844\nOkay?\n\n696\n00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,609\nA computer is what we actually have.\n\n697\n00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:29,166\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n698\n00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:32,439\n>> So, because a computer can\nbe linked to only one user,\n\n699\n00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:34,750\nexcuse me I said it backwards.\n\n700\n00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,590\nWhich apparently is\nwhat I do all the time.\n\n701\n00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,755\nSo if we wanted to replace my name,\nlet's replace it with Jason.\n\n702\n00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:42,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n703\n00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,960\n>> All I would do is select Jason,\nyep, and then click OK,\n\n704\n00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,830\nand now that will successfully link\n\n705\n00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,750\nthat particular computer with\nJason's account instead.\n\n706\n00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,255\nThere it is, yep.\n\n707\n00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:02,280\n[LAUGH]\nLove scroll bars.\n\n708\n00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,880\n>> Yep.\n\n709\n00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,520\n>> Yep.\n\n710\n00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,020\n>> There we go.\n\n711\n00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:05,817\nSo there we have it.\n\n712\n00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,770\nNow, we're not seeing\nthe advantage of that right now.\n\n713\n00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,880\nBut that is pretty much the key, that now\nJason is on this computer and he says,\n\n714\n00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,210\nhey, I'm the updates are telling me I\ncan't push it out, I can actually push out\n\n715\n00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,570\nupdates when I need to, we can apply\npolicies, we can do all the other things\n\n716\n00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,809\nthat we actually saw when we right\nclicked on any of those computer links.\n\n717\n00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,070\n>> And also,\none large thing with linking computers,\n\n718\n00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,860\nis that to install software\nfrom the Intune portal,\n\n719\n00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,400\nyou have to be linked to your PC\n>> Very good point to make, yep.\n\n720\n00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:39,927\n>> To a PC.\n\n721\n00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:41,305\nMm-hm.\nSo you need that for software.\n\n722\n00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:42,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n723\n00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,880\n>> So\nlet's say that what Jason did here right,\n\n724\n00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,070\nis that he was on that computer, okay.\n\n725\n00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,880\nBut at this point, he actually realized\nhe needed a piece of software to be\n\n726\n00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,780\ninstalled on his bigger computer.\n\n727\n00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,590\nOkay, but he didn't have any, he said,\n\n728\n00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,700\nI can't get access to it,\nnow I'm supposed to get it through too.\n\n729\n00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,830\nOkay, so we can try mine again if we want\nto, and then see how this works out for\n\n730\n00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,480\nus to do that.\n\n731\n00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,830\nNow, during the break,\n\n732\n00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,340\nwe just added a couple pieces of\nsoftware into it to help us do this.\n\n733\n00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,090\nSo I'll try this again here.\n\n734\n00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:18,910\nSo all right, so at this point where\ndo I simply go to be able to get this?\n\n735\n00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,730\n>> What we did we did\npush out the software.\n\n736\n00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n737\n00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,590\nyou know we will go through\nour little Intune portal\n\n738\n00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,500\nconsole guy that got installed.\n\n739\n00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,359\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But first we just barely installed this\n\n740\n00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,190\nsoftware.\n\n741\n00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Uploaded into Windows Intune.\n\n742\n00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,790\nWe need to deploy the software\n>> Yeah.\n\n743\n00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,930\n>> And the job and it dropped down.\n\n744\n00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:37,440\n>> Yep.\n\n745\n00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,341\n>> All right, so let's [CROSSTALK].\n\n746\n00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:40,879\n>> Yeah.\n>> So let's jump over to MIP,\n\n747\n00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,049\noh yeah you already did.\n\n748\n00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:43,170\n>> Sweet.\n>> Great job Jason.\n\n749\n00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,780\nAll right, so we will head on\nover here to the software tab.\n\n750\n00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:54,760\nAces, not quite on our little list of\nobjectives but we'll hit this real quick.\n\n751\n00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,090\nAll right, so we've got down here\non the managed software tab and\n\n752\n00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,635\nthese, we got these little softwares.\n\n753\n00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:01,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n754\n00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,013\n>> We'll pick,\nwe've got 7zip and audacity.\n\n755\n00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:06,445\nWe'll just pick old 7zip.\n\n756\n00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:12,795\nClick on manage deployment and so we will\npush it out to all users, that works.\n\n757\n00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:15,725\nAnd we can just click on all computers,\nI guess, as well.\n\n758\n00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:19,690\nAnd click on next and\nit can choose what kind of deployment.\n\n759\n00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,155\nLet's say a required install for\n\n760\n00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:26,480\nthe PCs and available install for\nthe users, gets there.\n\n761\n00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,705\nA little conflicting,\nwe'll just click on finish.\n\n762\n00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:37,100\nAll right, so, now that PC is now being\npushed out to those those devices.\n\n763\n00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,640\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Then I quickly open up the little\n\n764\n00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,830\nIntune center.\n\n765\n00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,910\nHere we go,\nget applications from the company portal.\n\n766\n00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,390\nAnd with Intune it does take a little\nbit of time to push everything out and\n\n767\n00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,160\nto sync up so\nwe may not see them right away.\n\n768\n00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160\nBut let me get signed in.\n\n769\n00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:04,448\nWhy not.\n\n770\n00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:09,206\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n771\n00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:11,029\nAre you the primary user of this computer?\n\n772\n00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:13,931\nSure.\n\n773\n00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:16,540\nError has occurred.\n\n774\n00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,120\nThat's too bad.\n\n775\n00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,630\nYes I am.\n\n776\n00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:26,020\nThe ground's [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK].\n\n777\n00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,770\nAll right.\n\n778\n00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:31,260\nSo it's not displaying any, so it is\nshowing that I am now linked to my device.\n\n779\n00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,940\nAnd the apps would show\nhere in this white space.\n\n780\n00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,570\nSo it's not showing.\n\n781\n00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,985\n>> Right\n>> Any apps yet.\n\n782\n00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,550\nAnd it does take a bit of time.\n\n783\n00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,970\n>> It takes a little time.\n\n784\n00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,590\n>> I mean just click on all apps, we'll\nprobably see that nothing has been yet.\n\n785\n00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,840\nThe [INAUDIBLE] yeah, all right.\n\n786\n00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,610\nSo, yep so\nit's not seeing that software yet.\n\n787\n00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,085\nI bet by the end of the show,\nwe'll see it up there.\n\n788\n00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:51,700\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n789\n00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,558\n>> All right so,\nall right so there's that.\n\n790\n00:36:55,558 --> 00:37:01,070\nNow the next point that we have\nto touch on is manage policies.\n\n791\n00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,790\n>> Yep.\n>> Under manage policies, so\n\n792\n00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,050\nthen here in the little\nconsole edit portal.\n\n793\n00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,410\nSo down there on the little\ntab there looks like a scroll.\n\n794\n00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,650\nWe have the policies, note the policies.\n\n795\n00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:20,096\nOver on the right-hand side under tasks,\nwe have add policy.\n\n796\n00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:22,977\nAnd we got a number of\npolicies to add on here.\n\n797\n00:37:22,977 --> 00:37:25,605\nSo we have the mobile\ndevice security policy.\n\n798\n00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,795\n[INAUDIBLE] manage out the mobile devices.\n\n799\n00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:28,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n800\n00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,584\n>> We have policies to manage\nthe Windows firewall built in,\n\n801\n00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:34,300\nWindows firewall or\nthe Intune agent settings.\n\n802\n00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,158\nAnd so this right here will manage\nlike your end point protection and\n\n803\n00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:41,555\nthose [INAUDIBLE] to get it turned on and\nto manage the scans.\n\n804\n00:37:41,555 --> 00:37:44,979\nAnd the very last one here,\nthe Intune center policies.\n\n805\n00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,900\nThat I'll manage the stuff with that.\n\n806\n00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> The contact information,\n\n807\n00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,980\nif you needed to get some help.\n\n808\n00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,280\nAnd yeah.\n\n809\n00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,170\n>> Yeah, using these templates\nreally kinda gives us the default\n\n810\n00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,420\nof what Windows Intune would like us\nto use, and then we can go back in and\n\n811\n00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,746\ncustomize them as we choose to.\n\n812\n00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:05,717\n>> Mm-hm, and so yeah,\nlet's roll out a policy.\n\n813\n00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,220\n>> Sure.\n\n814\n00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,048\n>> Lets do an Intune agent settings.\n\n815\n00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:10,914\n>> All right.\n\n816\n00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,392\n>> Recommend settings, nah,\nwe will do a custom policy.\n\n817\n00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,840\n>> That one.\n\n818\n00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,921\n>> This guy fires up now this one will\ncreate policies for end point protection,\n\n819\n00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:26,941\nand so on here, let's just call it,\nwhat do you wanna call it, Ronny?\n\n820\n00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:33,872\n>> Let's call it, security or, yeah.\n\n821\n00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:34,789\n>> Scan policy.\n\n822\n00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:35,602\n>> Scan policies.\n\n823\n00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:36,473\nThere we go.\n\n824\n00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:39,886\n>> All right, scan policy.\n\n825\n00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:42,312\nAll right, so now we, is the letters.\n\n826\n00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:43,020\n>> Yap.\n\n827\n00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,083\n>> Not a terribly big fan, the.\n\n828\n00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:50,180\nSo in this policy,\nwe'll just shut this guy up.\n\n829\n00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,090\nSo, install end point protection,\nwe've got yes or no.\n\n830\n00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,535\nIt's a little slider, we can click it on,\n\n831\n00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:59,585\nnow it's, that, this option will\nnot be included in our policy.\n\n832\n00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:00,405\n>> Right.\n\n833\n00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:03,569\n>> We'll click it so it will read,\ninstall end point protection,\n\n834\n00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:05,865\neven if third party\nprotection is installed.\n\n835\n00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:06,465\n>> Oh.\n\n836\n00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:07,965\n>> Sure.\n>> Yeah, why not?\n\n837\n00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:10,100\n>> Yep, and then we will enable it.\n\n838\n00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,510\nAnd disable, clone UI I'll say no,\n\n839\n00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,275\ncreate a system restore point before\nmalware remediation, definitely.\n\n840\n00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:18,190\n>> Yes.\n>> Why not.\n\n841\n00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,822\nWe did a show about system restore.\n\n842\n00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:23,290\n>> We did.\n\n843\n00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,170\n>> All right, triggers all,\nsure, sounds good.\n\n844\n00:39:25,170 -->

download.\n\n847\n00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,010\n>> That's right.\n\n848\n00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,140\n>> Sure, why not?\n\n849\n00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,800\nAnd network inspection, yada, yada.\n\n850\n00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,195\nAll right, the schedule, so\na daily scan, sure, are you running?\n\n851\n00:39:42,195 --> 00:39:42,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n852\n00:39:42,890 -->

Sure.\n\n856\n00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,170\n>> How about noon?\n\n857\n00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:49,866\n>> Okay, do it at noon.\n\n858\n00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:51,800\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, I was like,\nwhy do you even ask?\n\n859\n00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,660\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n860\n00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,540\n>> If you're gonna say what I do.\n\n861\n00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,060\nAnd quick scan, sure.\n\n862\n00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,750\nSchedule a full scan, so we'll do that\n>> Every day [LAUGH].\n\n863\n00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,268\n>> Every Sunday,\nyou know what, let's do it.\n\n864\n00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:03,850\n>> There we go.\n\n865\n00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,050\n>> Every Monday because who knows what\nRonnie's doing with his computer through\n\n866\n00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,610\nthe weekend.\n\n867\n00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,865\nSo we'll do Monday, 3 AM.\n\n868\n00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,040\n>> There we go.\n\n869\n00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,952\n>> Which hopefully you've\ngone to sleep by then.\n\n870\n00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:15,260\n[SOUND] it looks good.\n\n871\n00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,880\nWow.\n\n872\n00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,000\n>> You have a lot of options.\n\n873\n00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,716\n>> A number of options [CROSSTALK].\n\n874\n00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:24,144\nAnd then we'll save,\nwe'll save our policy.\n\n875\n00:40:24,144 --> 00:40:25,154\nDo you want to deploy the policy?\n\n876\n00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:26,221\n>> Yes, deploy it.\n\n877\n00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:28,149\n>> All right, let's deploy it.\n\n878\n00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:30,250\nAnd who do we want to deploy it to?\n\n879\n00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,956\nLet's just choose everybody.\n\n880\n00:40:31,956 --> 00:40:35,990\nAll computers, all devices,\nwill be getting this policy.\n\n881\n00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:39,250\nAnd there we go, and that's that.\n\n882\n00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:43,852\nNow, if we want to change it after\nthe fact we can manage deployment\n\n883\n00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:47,920\nyou know at this point we can change\nwho it is we push this policy out to.\n\n884\n00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,440\n>> All right\n>> So\n\n885\n00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,580\nthere's a lot of different\nsettings that we can do here.\n\n886\n00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,040\nNow, you might wonder well\nwhy would I need to do that.\n\n887\n00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,215\nWell remember if you do have,\n\n888\n00:40:56,215 --> 00:40:59,830\nagain computers that are not part of your\nnetwork here but they're going to be\n\n889\n00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,340\naccessing network resources here, you\nwant to go ahead and make sure that they\n\n890\n00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,230\nare running the actual at least security\nlevel that you're wanting them to run.\n\n891\n00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:12,010\nSo by using the idea of end point\nprotection here, it's gonna go ahead and\n\n892\n00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,710\nactually put that on those machines and\nI guarantee you something, okay, if,\n\n893\n00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,030\nif you don't uninstall that thing,\n[LAUGH] it's gonna take over forever.\n\n894\n00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,074\nSo, so yeah,\nyou gotta be careful here too.\n\n895\n00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:26,097\nSo Ross, one of the important things is,\nafter we're done,\n\n896\n00:41:26,097 --> 00:41:27,855\nmake sure we uninstall that [LAUGH].\n\n897\n00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:30,154\n>> Oh, the, little, the In Tune-?\"\n>> Oh yeah, the In Tune manager, yeah.\n\n898\n00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,268\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n899\n00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:31,907\nYeah.\n\n900\n00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:35,530\nYou know what, yeah, well, should we\ndiscuss how to safely remove In Tune.\n\n901\n00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,199\n>> Yeah.\n\n902\n00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,980\n>> So, so, okay, yeah, funny story.\n\n903\n00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,980\nSo, Ronnie and I, back in the day, we you\nknow, in tunes rolling out, you know.\n\n904\n00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,320\nAnd so we're getting all jazzed up and,\noh that's right, yeah.\n\n905\n00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,710\nIt's for the the 688 exam.\n\n906\n00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so we're, we're gearing up and\n\n907\n00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:53,820\ngetting into In Tune, so so I, I created\nan account and I enrolled my PC and, and\n\n908\n00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,030\nmy PCs at home, and I, I sent a thing out\nto Ron like, hey Ronnie, enroll your PC.\n\n909\n00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,867\nIt's really cool.\n\n910\n00:41:58,867 --> 00:41:59,424\n>> And I did.\n\n911\n00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:00,852\n>> An, and, and, in the,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n912\n00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,540\n>> And 30 days later, right?\n\n913\n00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,150\nIt, it goes out.\n\n914\n00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,330\nNow there is a little bit of a grace\nperiod, and you know, and that was it.\n\n915\n00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,288\nSo, like, okay that's fine.\n\n916\n00:42:07,288 --> 00:42:10,586\nWell, In Tune, manages a lot of stuff.\n\n917\n00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:12,142\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you're, you know,\n\n918\n00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:14,278\nyour virus definitions, your scans\n>> Updates.\n\n919\n00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:15,323\n>> Updates,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n920\n00:42:15,323 --> 00:42:16,825\n>> So critical and security updates,\n\n921\n00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,250\nit manages all that stuff and,\n>> Yeah\n\n922\n00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,350\n>> You now, and, being,\n\n923\n00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,370\na, a new admin to manage.\n\n924\n00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,910\nPoor old Ronnie's PC.\n>> That's right.\n\n925\n00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:23,595\n>> I didn't do anything.\n\n926\n00:42:23,595 --> 00:42:25,323\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I didn't approve anything,\n\n927\n00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:27,100\nI didn't set up any automatic rules.\n\n928\n00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,702\nI mean our machines were way out of date,\nand the grace period expired and\n\n929\n00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:33,710\nIn Tune, indians got,\nyou can't log into it anymore.\n\n930\n00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,320\n>> Yeah.\n\n931\n00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,810\nAnd you can't can't uninstall it.\n\n932\n00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,340\n>> Yeah, yeah that's right.\n\n933\n00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,829\nSo the little agent that we installed\ndoesn't show up anywhere on,\n\n934\n00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,154\non the PC so we can remove it.\n\n935\n00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:47,174\nAnd I guess your clients can't\ngo in there to just remove it.\n\n936\n00:42:47,174 --> 00:42:48,589\n>> No\n>> Not easily.\n\n937\n00:42:48,589 --> 00:42:49,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n938\n00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:54,730\n>> And and so, we had a bear of a time\nremoving this client out of our machines.\n\n939\n00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,880\nThere was a series of scripts,\nto just, I mean, into new,\n\n940\n00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,200\nit really just roots itself in into\nyour computer and, you know, it has to.\n\n941\n00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,929\n>> Yeah.\n>> It has to so it that it.\n\n942\n00:43:01,929 --> 00:43:02,591\n>> Take over everything.\n\n943\n00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:04,448\n>> Yeah so it can managed remotely.\n\n944\n00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,516\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n945\n00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:09,260\n>> I'm trying to unroot that poor\nlittle guy, it, it was quite the bear.\n\n946\n00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:15,440\nSo, to the proper way, to remove a device,\nlet go uncover that now.\n\n947\n00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,640\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] just in case we forget.\n\n948\n00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,400\n>> So, over in the groups,\nwe'll go into our all computers, and\n\n949\n00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,700\nwe'll just click and get all of our PCs.\n\n950\n00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:26,929\nThere is a link.\n\n951\n00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,870\nRight there.\n\n952\n00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:33,415\nRetire and wipe, so retiring a PC.\n\n953\n00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:35,929\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Will then safely remove it.\n\n954\n00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:36,808\nSo it remove In Tune, and release control.\n\n955\n00:43:36,808 --> 00:43:38,328\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n956\n00:43:38,328 --> 00:43:39,300\n>> For that PC.\n\n957\n00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,000\n>> All right.\n\n958\n00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,080\nYeah.\n\n959\n00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,815\nYeah just undo the white part.\n\n960\n00:43:42,815 --> 00:43:44,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If it's your actual PC\n\n961\n00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,960\nthat you're working on.\n\n962\n00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,560\n>> Is that, CO1, is that,\nis that your PC, like your real one?\n\n963\n00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,740\n>> Yeah, that.\n>> Or is that a VM?\n\n964\n00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,345\n>> It doesn't matter.\n\n965\n00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:52,948\n[LAUGH]\n>> Should we wipe it real quick?\n\n966\n00:43:52,948 --> 00:43:55,320\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, if you want to.\n\n967\n00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,550\n>> No.\n>> Sure thing\n\n968\n00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,310\n>> Maybe after the show.\n\n969\n00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:57,910\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n970\n00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,760\n>> Could be funny.\n\n971\n00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,980\nWell, well, you do have backups.\n\n972\n00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,400\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah.\n>> We talked about that before.\n\n973\n00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,070\nWhen, when the other.\n\n974\n00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,200\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nI have backup.\n\n975\n00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,150\n>> You have backups?\n\n976\n00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,880\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n977\n00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,240\n>> Has it been a month yet?\n\n978\n00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,520\n>> It'll be just about the end of new\nmonth is what's happening here soon.\n\n979\n00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,070\nYes.\n\n980\n00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:11,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n981\n00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,240\n>> Yes.\n\n982\n00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,120\n>> So, we've just talked\nabout the idea of policies.\n\n983\n00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,645\nI don't know why you got\nsidetracked on that but it was fun,\n\n984\n00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:22,000\n[LAUGH] until we wanted to wipe my\ncomputer then it wasn't so fun anymore.\n\n985\n00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,620\nIt is what we have it right, so for\nus there is a lot of stuff that you can\n\n986\n00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,287\nsee we are In Tune where it\nreally does root itself in and\n\n987\n00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:33,101\nso from and administrative standpoint.\n\n988\n00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:34,970\nWether you have machines internally or\n\n989\n00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,027\nagain people connecting in from\nthe outside, you want to ensure\n\n990\n00:44:38,027 --> 00:44:41,750\nthat they are getting the updates\nthat they need to you can do that.\n\n991\n00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,551\nIf you want to just make sure that\nyou're controlling acts as a software.\n\n992\n00:44:45,551 --> 00:44:48,360\nNow, our software, I've been waiting,\nit just hasn't popped yet, so\n\n993\n00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,800\nI'm assuming it's a timing\nissue at this point.\n\n994\n00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,695\nIf you want to control software right,\nand being deployed.\n\n995\n00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:59,065\nYou again send somebody out onto you know,\nfor a sales you know, trip\n\n996\n00:44:59,065 --> 00:45:02,065\nthat's down there and you actually have\nnew software that needs to be deployed for\n\n997\n00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:07,497\nyour you know, you're a management system\ninternally and has to get to that person.\n\n998\n00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:11,997\nWell, you, you could probably try and send\nthem a copy of the software or, or try and\n\n999\n00:45:11,997 --> 00:45:15,187\nmake them connect and jump through\nyour Dropbox and stuff like that.\n\n1000\n00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:16,377\nBut a lot of times,\n\n1001\n00:45:16,377 --> 00:45:21,227\nsimply telling them to go to their In Tune\nportal page here, should actually be able\n\n1002\n00:45:21,227 --> 00:45:24,957\nto give them the ability to install that\nsoftware once it gets pushed out, as well.\n\n1003\n00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,560\nSo it actually is easier.\n\n1004\n00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,828\nThat way you don't actually just have\nit floating out there in the world,\n\n1005\n00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,463\nyou actually have it some place\nwhere you can manage it, and\n\n1006\n00:45:33,463 --> 00:45:36,800\nonly the people that actually do connect\ninto In Tune will be able to get it.\n\n1007\n00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1008\n00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,710\n>> All right.\n\n1009\n00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,940\n>> Now as far as, all right,\noh yeah, so we go to our policies.\n\n1010\n00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,461\nThe, the last little part that we\nhave is about managing the computers.\n\n1011\n00:45:45,461 --> 00:45:48,104\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Now, with managing computer,\n\n1012\n00:45:48,104 --> 00:45:51,600\nthis whole thing was about\nmanaging the computer.\n\n1013\n00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,520\nThere are a few little, items that\nwe have additional to that stuff.\n\n1014\n00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,334\nOn the, on the PC here,\nwe have these remote tasks,\n\n1015\n00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:02,600\nand under these remote tasks.\n\n1016\n00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,520\nThese are, are the core of what we can do\nto this PC as it's out in the field and,\n\n1017\n00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,610\nand doing things.\n\n1018\n00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,955\nAll right,\nwe can initiate those mower scans.\n\n1019\n00:46:10,955 --> 00:46:12,511\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And check out for, for viruses for,\n\n1020\n00:46:12,511 --> 00:46:13,033\nfor the person.\n\n1021\n00:46:13,033 --> 00:46:14,897\n>> Right.\n>> We make sure that their computer is,\n\n1022\n00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,781\nis staying clean, according to whatever\ncompany policy that we may have.\n\n1023\n00:46:17,781 --> 00:46:19,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1024\n00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,750\nResta restarted their computer,\nand it's funny.\n\n1025\n00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,421\nIt's like everybody's, oh,\nmy computer is acting funny it's like,\n\n1026\n00:46:25,421 --> 00:46:29,090\nhave you re-booted well, no or\nmaybe yes, a 1000 times.\n\n1027\n00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,030\nBut yeah, we can initiate that\ncomputer restart from here.\n\n1028\n00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,927\nUpdate their definitions\nto new refresh policies.\n\n1029\n00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:36,487\n>> Yep.\nPerhaps if they have PC if it's not\n\n1030\n00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:40,346\nreporting in or Ronnie makes some\nnew policies to do something,\n\n1031\n00:46:40,346 --> 00:46:43,370\nthen we can refresh the policy on that.\n\n1032\n00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:47,950\nRefresh the inventory, so if there is any\nnew software on that PC, or we just want\n\n1033\n00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:52,770\nthe guys to check in and report all\nthat stuff, we can initiate that.\n\n1034\n00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:57,750\nAnd these, the last two down there are\ngrayed out, Remote Lock and Remote Reset.\n\n1035\n00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,020\nWindows In Tune can also\nmanage mobile devices.\n\n1036\n00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,510\nSo your Android devices,\nyour Windows Phone devices.\n\n1037\n00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:07,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> Apple iPhone, and what, what have you.\n\n1038\n00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,990\nNow those devices, you know,\nthen we can remotely lock it.\n\n1039\n00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n1040\n00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,990\n>> Reset that pass code.\n\n1041\n00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,410\nThe you know, we do have a,\n\n1042\n00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,440\na mobile separate section-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1043\n00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,018\n>> Where we dive into all the mobile.\n\n1044\n00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:18,698\nStuff and.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1045\n00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:20,060\n>> Add those devices in here.\n\n1046\n00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,005\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1047\n00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,660\n>> Yeah now for us,\nremember that you might think,\n\n1048\n00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,690\nlike, the remote wipe\nsounds a little bit harsh.\n\n1049\n00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,170\nBut what if somebody were to\ntake off with your device.\n\n1050\n00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,180\nYou know, or your smartphone,\nyou lose it, or\n\n1051\n00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,400\nagain somebody actually\ndoes steal it outright.\n\n1052\n00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,380\nThe good thing is,\nif they turn that machine on, right?\n\n1053\n00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,140\nYou set that, up to do that remote wipe.\n\n1054\n00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,770\nIt at least clears out, you know,\nthe information from there, too.\n\n1055\n00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,384\nSo.\n\n1056\n00:47:42,384 --> 00:47:45,450\nReally good technology for\nus in terms of security.\n\n1057\n00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,265\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1058\n00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:49,806\n[INAUDIBLE] Yeah,\na lot of these people, you know, they,\n\n1059\n00:47:49,806 --> 00:47:54,236\nI guess were In Tune can really shine,\nis for the people who work from home\n\n1060\n00:47:54,236 --> 00:47:54,829\n>> Right\n\n1061\n00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:56,937\n>> Or are out on the road a lot where\n\n1062\n00:47:56,937 --> 00:48:02,120\nthose devices are out on the road and\ncan get snatched or left or whatnot.\n\n1063\n00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,280\n>> Usually great control.\n\n1064\n00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,865\nEven though they're not\nconnected in your network.\n\n1065\n00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:05,587\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1066\n00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:06,655\n>> Yup.\n\n1067\n00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:10,392\n>> All right Ronnie, well that I guess\nyeah we've touched on it the four\n\n1068\n00:48:10,392 --> 00:48:11,547\nlittle topics\n>> Right.\n\n1069\n00:48:11,547 --> 00:48:13,590\n>> That we have today.\n\n1070\n00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,460\nIs there anything else\nthat you'd toss in there.\n\n1071\n00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,050\n>> Remember, in terms of Windows and,\nand the idea of certification.\n\n1072\n00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:21,770\nRight.\n\n1073\n00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,493\nYou can always count on this very fact.\n\n1074\n00:48:23,493 --> 00:48:26,802\nIf this sounds brand new to you, it's\nprobably going to be covered on the exam.\n\n1075\n00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:30,293\nWindows love their new features,\nin, in, on the exams.\n\n1076\n00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:32,676\nSo make sure take the time to go to this.\n\n1077\n00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,410\nSuggest that you go ahead and\ncreate an account and do this.\n\n1078\n00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,680\nIf you can't use virtualization,\ndon't do this on your own computer\n\n1079\n00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,130\nunless you actually are willing\nto take a look at it.\n\n1080\n00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,085\nDid they finally show up?\n\n1081\n00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:43,766\n>> Well, I don't know.\n\n1082\n00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:46,842\nI was pulling this to review some stuff.\n\n1083\n00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:47,533\n>> Yeah.\n\n1084\n00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:48,381\n>> And we did skip over one.\n\n1085\n00:48:48,381 --> 00:48:49,013\n>> Did we?\n\n1086\n00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:49,634\n>> Yeah.\n\n1087\n00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:51,596\nConfigure monitoring and alerts.\n\n1088\n00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,587\n>> Yeah, so, there you go.\n\n1089\n00:48:53,587 --> 00:48:54,737\nRonny, I asked you.\n\n1090\n00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:56,048\nI said hey, what [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1091\n00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:57,691\n>> I, I did not, yeah.\n\n1092\n00:48:57,691 --> 00:48:58,672\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Alright.\n\n1093\n00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:01,522\n>> Yeah, well,\nshould we get to [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1094\n00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:02,189\n>> Yeah, we got time.\n\n1095\n00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:02,787\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Before we close out here?\n\n1096\n00:49:02,787 --> 00:49:05,160\n>> Yeah.\nWe've got some time left.\n\n1097\n00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,340\nAlright.\nLet's get back on over to good old\n\n1098\n00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,130\nWintune.\n\n1099\n00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,520\nAnd for our monitoring.\n\n1100\n00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,282\n>> And alert there is another like.\n\n1101\n00:49:13,282 -->

00:49:23,940\nAlerts, now we click on\nhere to alert types.\n\n1104\n00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,977\nNow these Alert types are built-in so\nwe can enable and disable.\n\n1105\n00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:28,807\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1106\n00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:32,273\n>> And there is just a slew of\nthese built-in alert types.\n\n1107\n00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:38,765\nThings to monitor and if something\npops up to send out that alert.\n\n1108\n00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:40,910\nSo you know what Ronnie,\nlet's configure one.\n\n1109\n00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,150\n>> Go ahead.\n\n1110\n00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,670\n>> Alright,\nwe'll use this one at the very top.\n\n1111\n00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,720\nA duplicate IP address has been detected.\n\n1112\n00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,570\nAlright, so right now we can\nsee that is a critical alert.\n\n1113\n00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,121\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1114\n00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:54,770\n>> Alright, and currently it is disabled.\n\n1115\n00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,780\nSo, we can just click on the configure\ntab and add a few items.\n\n1116\n00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,968\nAnd now, what we can do with it, and\nwe'll just simply enable this tab,\n\n1117\n00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:05,746\nwe'll click okay, all right,\nso there, now it's enabled, so\n\n1118\n00:50:05,746 --> 00:50:07,825\nnow we will receive these reports.\n\n1119\n00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:08,354\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1120\n00:50:08,354 --> 00:50:12,626\n>> Now, after an alert is generated,\nwe need a way to push them out.\n\n1121\n00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:15,035\n>> Right.\n>> So whoever needs to know, can know.\n\n1122\n00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,672\n>> Mm-hm.\nRecipients.\n\n1123\n00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:21,850\n>> Down here, we'll click on

go.\n\n1130\n00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,125\nSo now Ronnie is the recipient.\n\n1131\n00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,640\nNotification rules all right, so\nnow we can take these rules, right?\n\n1132\n00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,412\nThat you know, so\nbefore in the alert types.\n\n1133\n00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:48,132\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1134\n00:50:48,132 --> 00:50:55,294\n>> [SOUND] I guess we can draw this little\ndown arrow down here after this loads up.\n\n1135\n00:50:55,294 --> 00:50:59,746\nAnd there is different classes of alert\ntypes without having to scroll through\n\n1136\n00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:01,442\nthat big long list of things.\n\n1137\n00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:04,550\nSo those alert types are classified.\n\n1138\n00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:05,341\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, you know,\n\n1139\n00:51:05,341 --> 00:51:07,244\ndifferent classified in different classes.\n\n1140\n00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:08,243\n>> Yeah.\n\n1141\n00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:08,800\n>>

here, now we can\nassess things so how about all alerts.\n\n1145\n00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:15,208\n>> There you go.\n\n1146\n00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:18,494\n>> [SOUND] We'll select our recipients,\nwe'll just have one so, Ronnie.\n\n1147\n00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:19,939\n>> Here you go\n>> All right hopefully\n\n1148\n00:51:19,939 --> 00:51:22,130\nyou don't get calls in\nthe middle of the

go.\n\n1152\n00:51:25,595 --> 00:51:27,726\n>> Yeah.\n>> So now, any alert that is generated,\n\n1153\n00:51:27,726 --> 00:51:31,457\nactually all alerts that are generated\nthat aren't able that we are watching.\n\n1154\n00:51:31,457 --> 00:51:33,066\n>> Mm-hm.\nWill now send out and\n\n1155\n00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:35,050\nemail to, Ronnie Wong here.\n\n1156\n00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:35,671\n>> That's right.\n\n1157\n00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:38,533\n>> That, there has been a duplicate\nIP address on network and\n\n1158\n00:51:38,533 --> 00:51:39,560\nyou can respond to it.\n\n1159\n00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,005\n>> So\nremember in this particular setting right,\n\n1160\n00:51:42,005 --> 00:51:46,037\nit's not enough just to generate the\nalert, you have to generate the alert and\n\n1161\n00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:49,659\nthen for it to be affective,\nsomebody is gonna be notified with this.\n\n1162\n00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,990\nSo getting that set up is also and\nimportant concept for us.\n\n1163\n00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:53,600\n>> Mm.\n\n1164\n00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,608\n>> Yeah\n>> Alright, so there.\n\n1165\n00:51:55,608 --> 00:51:59,880\n[LAUGH]

00:52:07,106\n>> Yeah.\nNo,\n\n1171\n00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:09,751\nthere is a wealth of other stuff-\n>> Right.\n\n1172\n00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:10,732\n>> To when is in tune.\n\n1173\n00:52:10,732

covered just the little bit\ndown here, just those few items.\n\n1176\n00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,889\nYou know, up higher, we, you know,\nwe'll get into the Endpoint protection.\n\n1177\n00:52:22,889

with\n\n51\n00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,310\nWork Folders-\n>> Yep.\n\n52\n00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,926\n>> And Sync Center, I believe\nRonnie's been tirelessly going over-\n\n53\n00:02:34,926 -->

And finally, we'll wrap up with things,\n\n57\n00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:46,505\nlike supporting broadband tethering.\n\n58\n00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:51,525\n>> And Sync Center, which it seems\nlike every set of objectives,\n\n59\n00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,765\nwe get into Sync Center\n>> Yes.\n\n60\n00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:55,067\n>> And with things to do with\n\n61\n00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,538\nSync Center it's-\n>> I know.\n\n62\n00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:59,665\n>> And it's always out there\n>> Yeah.\n\n63\n00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:03,770\nMobile devices for us have been around for\na long time, and so for us here,\n\n64\n00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,008\nwe need to actually, get more into it, and\nthe reason why is that even for long time\n\n65\n00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:11,550\nsince today, you could say, really of\nXP and Windows Vista, and Windows 7.\n\n66\n00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,140\nIt's only become more and\n\n67\n00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,770\nmore in which device will actually become\nmore prevalent inside of our networks.\n\n68\n00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,100\nSo, unlike those days in which you only\nhad a few devices you could support,\n\n69\n00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,740\ntoday, everybody brings even multiple\ndevices to work, that are actually,\n\n70\n00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,300\ngonna be wireless, and they need to\nactually access network resources.\n\n71\n00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,290\nSo, for us we need to make\nsure that we can manage, and\n\n72\n00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,840\nwe need to be sure that we can sync\nup the information between them.\n\n73\n00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,200\nAnd so we've got several options for\nus, and today Windows 8.1\n\n74\n00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,380\nis part of that program of actually going\nto the idea of these kind of BYODs.\n\n75\n00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,920\nBecause of the advent of tablets, and of\ncourse, ultra-books, and stuff like this.\n\n76\n00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,120\nAnd so they want you to,\nof course, know all about it.\n\n77\n00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,990\nYeah.\n\n78\n00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,494\n>> So, Ronnie, you mentioned BYOD.\n\n79\n00:03:58,494 --> 00:03:59,170\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n80\n00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,390\nBring your own device.\n\n81\n00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,050\nSo, I heard that BYOD is on the way out.\n\n82\n00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,581\n>> It is.\n\n83\n00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:08,122\n>> And so, now its BYO-\n>> C\n\n84\n00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:08,954\n>> C, right, do you know,\n\n85\n00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:09,559\nwhat the C is for?\n\n86\n00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:10,270\n>> Computer.\n\n87\n00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,640\n>> No.\n\n88\n00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,803\n>> Card.\n>> No.\n\n89\n00:04:12,803 -->

Yeah.\n\n107\n00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,960\nIf you can actually separate people\nfrom their handheld devices in which\n\n108\n00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,765\nthey text while they drive,\nnow even better.\n\n109\n00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:43,605\nWell, there you go.\n\n110\n00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,892\n>> It should be easy cuz\nit's against the law.\n\n111\n00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:47,275\n>> That's right.

there's a [CROSSTALK] cradle on the\nmotorcycle C-clamp that I set the phone.\n\n127\n00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:11,848\nNow, of course, I put it there for maps.\n\n128\n00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:14,108\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right, [CROSSTALK] so I could get maps,\n\n129\n00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:18,469\nbut if I get a message then, I can use\na conductive thread, and I can reply to it\n\n130\n00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:22,519\nright there without taking my glove off,\nit is extremely convenient.\n\n131\n00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,670\n>> Yeah, especially at 95 miles per hour.\n\n132\n00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,700\nIt's incredibly convenient.\n\n133\n00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,820\n>> And that's in the parking lot.\n\n134\n00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,460\n>> That's in the parking

So, we supporting these mobile devices.\n\n141\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,125\nWe are gonna be using Windows Intune\nprimarily on how to manage these devices,\n\n142\n00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,070\ncuz Windows Intune, pretty sweet.\n\n143\n00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,950\n>> It is.\n\n144\n00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,760\nYeah, for us here, this is a essentially\na Cloud infrastructure for\n\n145\n00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,390\nus, managing these small\ndevices that we actually have.\n\n146\n00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,900\nThat really don't have a good fit\ninside of our regular business network,\n\n147\n00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,066\nI'm trying to think of the best term for\nit, right.\n\n148\n00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,550\nSo, an active he might go how the heck\ndo we actually get this stuff that, so\n\n149\n00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,700\nwe can manage them.\n\n150\n00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,250\nThat we can actually make sure that they\nare actually going to do what we need them\n\n151\n00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,330\nto do, and if they get lost, how do we\nactually wipe them if we need to, or\n\n152\n00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,490\nagain, limit them to.\n\n153\n00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,970\nWhat Windows Intune is one of\nthe infrastructures that we can have here,\n\n154\n00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,130\nhosted by Microsoft that\nwe can do this with.\n\n155\n00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,916\nSo, that's a really slicked up platform.\n\n156\n00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:21,600\nYeah.\n\n157\n00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,710\n>> Yep.\n\n158\n00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,100\nNow Ronnie, so\nwhy don't we just jump right into it?\n\n159\n00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,600\n>> Let's do it.\n\n160\n00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,300\n>> And we'll jump over into\nWindows Intune, and take a look.\n\n161\n00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,550\nNow, before the show,\n\n162\n00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,425\nthere are a couple of Items Devices-\n>> Yep.\n\n163\n00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:37,980\n>> That I add up in here.\n\n164\n00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,450\nAnd there is an Android phone, so that one\nup there, so that is my personal phone.\n\n165\n00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,255\n>> I see that, yes.\n\n166\n00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:47,668\n>> [CROSSTALK] And\nin there, is the Hans iPad.\n\n167\n00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:49,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n168\n00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,650\nit's a little iPad mini that he left here.\n\n169\n00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,550\nAnd so, what better do with a left device,\nwell, yeah,\n\n170\n00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,890\ncuz Don's out of the studio, right now.\n\n171\n00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,959\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n>> But, so I mean, he left it, so\n\n172\n00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,169\nwhy not put up an Intune, and\nmanage the heck out of that thing.\n\n173\n00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:01,703\n>> Yeah.\n\n174\n00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:02,570\n>> Right.\n\n175\n00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,675\nSo, the process with it,\nit varies from device to device.\n\n176\n00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:11,815\nNow, since I don't own a Windows phone,\na device.\n\n177\n00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:13,540\nRonnie, do you have a surface tablets?\n\n178\n00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,750\n>> I do not have a surface tablet, nor\n\n179\n00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,040\ndo I have the 40,000 megapixel\nphone from Windows phone either.\n\n180\n00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,520\n>> Right?\nYeah, those Nokia phones?\n\n181\n00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,160\n>> Yeah, those are nice.\n\n182\n00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,660\n>> They're sweet.\n\n183\n00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,570\nYep.\n\n184\n00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,280\n>> Might get one.\n\n185\n00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,340\n>> What?\n>> I might get one.\n\n186\n00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,930\n>> Yeah, you should.\n>> Yeah.\n\n187\n00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,910\n>> All right, so\nwe don't have those devices, and\n\n188\n00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,510\nso we won't be going\nthrough the setup of those.\n\n189\n00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,830\nAll right, but we do have an Android\ndevice, and we do have an iOS device.\n\n190\n00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:42,154\nNow, to get your iOS device connected up\ninto Windows Intune, there's a process.\n\n191\n00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:43,390\n>> All right.\n\n192\n00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,629\nYou have to log in to, actually,\n\n193\n00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:51,043\nif we click over, on to this device.\n\n194\n00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,661\nAnd this thing just sits there and\ngrinds away.\n\n195\n00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,360\n>> There you go.\n\n196\n00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400\n>> All right.\n\n197\n00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,910\nNow, to get on, to get the,\nthe device up there.\n\n198\n00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,040\nRight.\nWe have to download this Certificate file.\n\n199\n00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,380\nActually, it's like a certificate\nsigning request file, and\n\n200\n00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,420\nonce we get that file,\nthen we can log into Apple's cloud.\n\n201\n00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,100\nThis like management cloud portal and\nthen we upload\n\n202\n00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,860\nthat file into the cloud portal, and\nApple does whatever they do to it.\n\n203\n00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,090\nAnd then we download\nthat certificate again.\n\n204\n00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,400\n>> Right.\n>> Then with that certificate we can then\n\n205\n00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,840\nuse it then to join our\ndevice up to in tune.\n\n206\n00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,510\nNow there is the Company Portal\napp that is in the app store and\n\n207\n00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,600\nin the android store,\ndownload on our device.\n\n208\n00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,200\nTo connect them up into Windows Intune.\n\n209\n00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,220\nNow, Android and iOS, right?\n\n210\n00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,830\nIt's a, yeah,\na pretty simple little process.\n\n211\n00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,570\n>> Yeah.\n\n212\n00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,420\nNow, for us here, right, these devices,\nagain, Apple has probably already been\n\n213\n00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,430\nworking on this, but I think Android is\nthe one that kind of impressed you, right?\n\n214\n00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,250\nThe very fact that it was as simple\nas it actually come out to be, and\n\n215\n00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,710\nwithout actually having to go through like\ngot third-party, like the ActiveSync and\n\n216\n00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,730\nall that stuff.\n\n217\n00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,730\nWhich we actually used to have to do.\n\n218\n00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,870\nSo now, it's fairly sophisticated\nin everything that we're doing here\n\n219\n00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,800\nin what's going on for that.\n\n220\n00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,340\nSo in terms that, right?\n\n221\n00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,245\nThe key here is again getting that\nmanagement app on the device so\n\n222\n00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:23,615\nthat we can manage it.\n\n223\n00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:26,017\nAnd so that's what you actually\nhave to do first thing.\n\n224\n00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:26,629\n>> Yeah.\n\n225\n00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:27,545\nMm-hm.\n\n226\n00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:28,445\n>> Yup.\n>> All right.\n\n227\n00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:31,185\nWell, first things first, I guess.\n\n228\n00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:35,630\nWe might as well, you might as well\njust get it out of these devices and\n\n229\n00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,220\nstart hooking\n>> Sure.\n\n230\n00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,250\n>> Them up, all right?\n\n231\n00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,750\n>> Yup.\n\n232\n00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,820\n>> Well, do the iOS device so\nwe'll run through that process right?\n\n233\n00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,600\nSo in the administrator\noverview right here,\n\n234\n00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,830\ndown here in the bottom with\nmobile device management.\n\n235\n00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,380\nAll right.\n\n236\n00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,100\nThere's one step that we have to do.\n\n237\n00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,890\nOver in the tasks pane, over here.\n\n238\n00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,040\nSet mobile device management authority.\n\n239\n00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,580\nAll right.\n\n240\n00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,680\nWe have to click on that,\nand enable this feature.\n\n241\n00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,655\nIt's right here, it will these\nmobile devices to be managed, right?\n\n242\n00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:07,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To set to us, you know,\n\n243\n00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,300\nIntune administrators.\n\n244\n00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,785\nAs the authority to\nmanage over that device.\n\n245\n00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:12,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n246\n00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,810\n>> So we turn this guy on and\nthen each one over here, so\n\n247\n00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,470\nunder the Management Authority,\neach one over here has their own little\n\n248\n00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,310\nset of-\n>> Right.\n\n249\n00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,895\n>> Of steps.\n\n250\n00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,900\n>> Now,\nI was pretty impressed with Android.\n\n251\n00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,700\n>> Right.\n\n252\n00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,630\n>> And in the very beginning,\nso Android down here now.\n\n253\n00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,425\nIt's blacked out, right?\n\n254\n00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:29,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So there's, there's no link, and\n\n255\n00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,730\nit says, no for the steps\nare required to manage these things.\n\n256\n00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,680\n>> Android was one of the the most\ndifficult ones to set it with\n\n257\n00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,650\nWindows Intune in the very beginning.\n\n258\n00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,125\n>> You had to set up this\nexchange active sync data connect\n\n259\n00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,810\nup into Intune\n>> Right\n\n260\n00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,610\n>> And there was this, like a link,\n\n261\n00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,690\nyou can link your Android device into\nexchange, and then it could then sync up\n\n262\n00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,206\nto what is Intune where you can manage it,\nit's a big long freaking process.\n\n263\n00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:56,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n264\n00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,660\n>> Well now, all you have to do is just\ndownload the little Company Portal app.\n\n265\n00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,500\n>> And then you're ready to go.\n\n266\n00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,740\n>> Then you're ready to go.\n\n267\n00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,950\nNow with the iOS device right, so\nwe click on iOS device, right?\n\n268\n00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,140\nSo, we have this guy up here.\n\n269\n00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,940\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,570\nWe have to upload, right,\nand the certificate,\n\n271\n00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,670\nthat's when we pulled that guy down\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n272\n00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,910\n>> And right, so\nthat's the reason that we put it up there.\n\n273\n00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,680\nSo we click on, alright.\n\n274\n00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,180\nSo we go here and\nwe download that certificate request.\n\n275\n00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,780\nWe download in to our computers.\n\n276\n00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,240\nWe just click on this Apple link there,\nand then you sign in with your Apple ID.\n\n277\n00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,025\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n278\n00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:37,695\nthen it'll prompt this little low\nwindow where you can click on browse,\n\n279\n00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,615\nthen you upload that certificate.\n\n280\n00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,235\nApple does its little thing,\nand downloads it again.\n\n281\n00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,865\nAnd then once you get it back from Apple,\n\n282\n00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:49,270\nyou click on that button there to upload\nthe certificate back into Windows Intune.\n\n283\n00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,030\nAnd then once Windows Intune has it,\n\n284\n00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,530\nyou can download the Company Portal app\non your iOS device and sign into it.\n\n285\n00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n286\n00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,620\n>> And then there you go.\n\n287\n00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,060\nAnd they're all connected up.\n\n288\n00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,680\n>> So the hardest part of this\nprocess is really finding the correct\n\n289\n00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,276\nURL to get to the Windows Intune app.\n\n290\n00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n291\n00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,270\n>> Essentially, right?\n\n292\n00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,640\nTo be able to get there and\nthen open up that and\n\n293\n00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,850\nbe able to connect and do what we need to.\n\n294\n00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,360\nSo that's not bad at all.\n\n295\n00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,140\nThe rest of the process\nis probably fairly easy,\n\n296\n00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,215\nespecially for\nmost people that actually Apple devices.\n\n297\n00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:19,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n298\n00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yup.\n\n299\n00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,780\nNow I do have an Android device in here.\n\n300\n00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,620\nSo we can run through the process.\n\n301\n00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,350\n>> Oh, nice.\n>> And usually a couple of little steps.\n\n302\n00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,550\n>> Okay.\n>> So we can just run through it and\n\n303\n00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,210\nset up and see how it works.\n\n304\n00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:30,710\n>> Sounds good.\n\n305\n00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,430\n>> And there is a little bit of a delay,\nyou know for when we join the device.\n\n306\n00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,750\nFrom, yeah, when we join it until\nthey show up as a connected device.\n\n307\n00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,505\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do that first.\n\n308\n00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:44,560\n>> Okay.\n>> And perhaps by the end of the show\n\n309\n00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,520\nwe can see the device pop up here and\nin Intune.\n\n310\n00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,210\n>> Sounds good.\n\n311\n00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:55,220\n>> All right, so\nover on our trusty, trusty sky cam.\n\n312\n00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,860\n>> Move my stuff out of your way.\n\n313\n00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,285\n>> So we got this little android device,\n\n314\n00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:08,575\nand we get over in\n>> Back to the Windows [INAUDIBLE],\n\n315\n00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:09,555\nWindows store.\n\n316\n00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,615\nThat's funny.\n>> Hey, that's almost as big as Galaxy S5.\n\n317\n00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:12,295\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:14,785\n>> I searched for it earlier.\n\n319\n00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:17,795\nSo I did a little search in the app\n\n320\n00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:19,335\nstore there for\n>> Look at that.\n\n321\n00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:20,460\n>> Intune.\nYup.\n\n322\n00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,350\nSo we got\nthe Windows Intune Company Portal.\n\n323\n00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,524\nAnd there it goes, and\nthen we will choose to install it.\n\n324\n00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:31,180\nAll right.\n\n325\n00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,144\nAnd of course,\nI'm sure everybody reads all of those.\n\n326\n00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,381\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll just click on accept.\n\n327\n00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,540\nAnd it will install.\n\n328\n00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,300\nNow, it's a,\na pretty small little utility,\n\n329\n00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,240\nshouldn't take too long\n>> Yep.\n\n330\n00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,290\n>> To pull down.\n\n331\n00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,305\nAnd then once it does and it installs.\n\n332\n00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:51,719\n>> There you go.\n\n333\n00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:55,177\n>> And\nonce it does we will then launch this app,\n\n334\n00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:57,820\nso I'll just click on open there.\n\n335\n00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,552\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That pulls up, alright, yep, and,\n\n336\n00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:05,390\nalright, so yeah, so on, in this little\nguy over there, it is kind of hard to see.\n\n337\n00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,030\nBut, before you can use this app,\n\n338\n00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,895\nyou must sign in using your\norganizational account, right?\n\n339\n00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:13,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well what account are we referring to?\n\n340\n00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,515\nWell this is the user account.\n\n341\n00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:16,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> User account that you have\n\n342\n00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,810\nin Windows Intune.\n\n343\n00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,030\nAnd now on this PC here,\nso over in, all right.\n\n344\n00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,200\nWe're going to click on All Users.\n\n345\n00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,780\nAnd these users that we\nhave in Windows Intune,\n\n346\n00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:36,250\nthese are the users that are able to log\nin to this Android device, all right?\n\n347\n00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,050\nWe have Don Pezet is up there.\n\n348\n00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,940\nWe've got Jason's user account,\nwe got my account,\n\n349\n00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,790\nand all those sorts of things up in there.\n\n350\n00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,748\nBut all right, so\nwe'll just go ahead and add this device.\n\n351\n00:14:52,582 --> 00:14:53,410\nAll right.\n\n352\n00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,340\nAnd so now, this is the login that\nwe use to login to Windows Intune.\n\n353\n00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,790\nNow, on mine, so if we take a look at\nmy machine over here on the laptop.\n\n354\n00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,100\nIn Windows Intune,\n\n355\n00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,720\nthese are the user accounts that we\nhave currently in Windows Intune.\n\n356\n00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,980\nThese are the users then,\nthat can add this android device, or\n\n357\n00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,270\nApple device in here, right?\n\n358\n00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,190\nSo Don can add it and yada, yada, yada.\n\n359\n00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,680\nSo we'll go ahead and choose,\nRonnie's already got one.\n\n360\n00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right should we pick Rob?\n\n361\n00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,730\n>> Sure.\n>> Well sorry we'll pick Rob.\n\n362\n00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,030\nAll right, so Rob, right?\n\n363\n00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:31,890\nAnd that is the log in that we'll use\nRob@testlab1001 yada yada, all right.\n\n364\n00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,720\nSo I'm gonna grab this device\nsince no one entered his password.\n\n365\n00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,560\nAll right, let me key that in right quick.\n\n366\n00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,589\n[MUSIC]\n\n367\n00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:48,858\n>> [LAUGH] Wow, you're really fast.\n\n368\n00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:52,514\nI have too many thumbs there.\n\n369\n00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:56,036\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so for\nus in terms of the Intune process,\n\n370\n00:15:56,036 --> 00:16:01,047\nwhether you're actually on an Android\nphone, or the idea of an iOS device,\n\n371\n00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:06,820\nthe process is relatively simple at this\npoint, in terms of what we're doing.\n\n372\n00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,550\nThe only thing that's really complicated,\nis just making sure\n\n373\n00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,570\nthat you get the actual app on the device\nitself, and then of course that you\n\n374\n00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,092\nuse the account that you were assigned\nto give access to Windows Intune.\n\n375\n00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:23,370\nSo once Nate finishes typing this in,\nit's gonna reach out onto the internet\n\n376\n00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,750\nat some point here, and make a connection\nto Intune, and then it will actually have\n\n377\n00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,602\nto sync up and do everything else that\nIntune actually needs us to be able to do.\n\n378\n00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,310\nSo we'll probably see it again.\n\n379\n00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,515\nIt might take a little bit of time.\n\n380\n00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:38,079\nNate said it took a little bit of\na delay here for us to get in.\n\n381\n00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,640\nAnd then we'll actually be\nready to go from this point.\n\n382\n00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,010\nNow, when we start actually\ndoing the idea of Intune,\n\n383\n00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,930\nremember that it is also in Intune\nas well as maybe inside of your\n\n384\n00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,472\nactive directory a lot of times, where\nyou can manage some of these devices.\n\n385\n00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,120\nBut Intune is probably the preferred\nlocation because it does give us\n\n386\n00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,920\na centralized store, and we can actually\nmanage it from anywhere inside,\n\n387\n00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,500\nwell, anywhere on the planet\nessentially for us here\n\n388\n00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,910\non all the devices and which may\nconnect to our company resources here.\n\n389\n00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,120\nSo it really is probably a better\nsolution overall if you are actually\n\n390\n00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,060\nsupporting the idea of bring your own\ndevices in terms of your network here.\n\n391\n00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,100\nSo, once you actually get\nit ready to go here, and\n\n392\n00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,500\nthen actually gets all synced up, this is\nthe management that gives us the ability\n\n393\n00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,450\nto be able to go ahead and\npush out updates if we need to.\n\n394\n00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,858\nIt allows us to configure the idea\nof file synchronizations as\n\n395\n00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:45,250\nwell in what we can now also end up doing,\nand\n\n396\n00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,440\nso there's a lot of different\nthings that it can do for us.\n\n397\n00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,650\nOkay.\n\n398\n00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,375\nHow's it going Nate?\n\n399\n00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n400\n00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,620\nYeah, it crashed twice.\n\n401\n00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,510\n>> Oh, okay.\n>> I'm trying to put in Rob's credentials,\n\n402\n00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,940\nbut he must have changed his password.\n\n403\n00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,970\n>> Oh, no.\n>> Cuz the one\n\n404\n00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,040\nthat I thought I gave Rob wasn't working.\n\n405\n00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,120\nSo I went ahead and\nput in my own credentials in there and\n\n406\n00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,438\nlet me stick it back over here.\n\n407\n00:18:07,438 --> 00:18:08,141\n>> All right.\n\n408\n00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:12,305\n>> All right, and yeah, so I entered\nin those credentials, I apologize,\n\n409\n00:18:12,305 --> 00:18:15,665\nthere's kind of a glare on it\nwith our overhead lighting.\n\n410\n00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:19,335\nSo right now, on this screen right here,\n\n411\n00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:25,360\nit's asking if I want to\nallow this company portal app\n\n412\n00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,010\nto be a device administrator\non this little Android device.\n\n413\n00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,910\n>> Yep.\n>> So I will then click that button.\n\n414\n00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,870\nRight?\nSo activate.\n\n415\n00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,526\nAnd then so\nnow it says adding your device.\n\n416\n00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:39,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And at this point it should reach\n\n417\n00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,960\nout then to Windows Intune and\nmake those connections.\n\n418\n00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,500\nAnd after a little bit of time it will\nappear up here in Windows Intune,\n\n419\n00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,250\nthe things that we can do to it.\n\n420\n00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,660\nNow towards the end of our episode\ntoday when everything is synced up and\n\n421\n00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,840\nthey're talking to each other, we can run\nthrough and we can try to wipe the device.\n\n422\n00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,040\n>> Oh, nice.\n>> We'll check it out.\n\n423\n00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,920\n>> Sounds good.\n\n424\n00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,880\n>> Yep.\nNow, so while this guy does its thing,\n\n425\n00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,010\nlet's get out the little iPad Mini\nsince this was all done beforehand.\n\n426\n00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,659\nBut, I guess,\nlet me wipe off the little screen first.\n\n427\n00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:12,623\n[LAUGH].\n\n428\n00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:23,020\n>> All right so,\nthere is the Apple device.\n\n429\n00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,000\nNow with this right here, we don't\nreally have any apps for this guy.\n\n430\n00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,060\nWe didn't push anything out.\n\n431\n00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,690\nI didn't create any or get any sign.\n\n432\n00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,532\nAnd so if we go into All Apps,\nsession expired.\n\n433\n00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,476\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n434\n00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,273\nLet me key this guy in.\n\n435\n00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:49,156\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n436\n00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:59,410\nNow the nice thing is, it looks like that\nthe other one may have already come up.\n\n437\n00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,850\nAlmost, not quite ready yet.\n\n438\n00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,100\n>> All right, there we go.\n\n439\n00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,210\nSo on this guy right there,\nso no available apps it says.\n\n440\n00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,310\nNow if we did have any apps then\nit would be connected up in there.\n\n441\n00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:22,260\nNow once everything is all synced up\nthere are a few items that we can do.\n\n442\n00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,540\nSo on the iPad here, so it has my devices\ndown there and it says Don's iPad.\n\n443\n00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,600\nAnd we touch on that and\nit gives us a little menu.\n\n444\n00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,490\nFrom this menu here we can\nchoose to reset the device,\n\n445\n00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,890\nto remove it, rename it, sort of things.\n\n446\n00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,770\nNow, we can do the same things from\nWindows Intune and the management console.\n\n447\n00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:49,080\nSo on my PC here,\nwe can click over to the Mobile Devices.\n\n448\n00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,010\nAnd once we pull up the mobile\ndevices here on my screen\n\n449\n00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,350\nand then we've got these two items here.\n\n450\n00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,410\nSo we've got Don's iPad and\n\n451\n00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,840\ndouble click on that,\nwe can look at the properties for it.\n\n452\n00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,901\nNow we can retire and wipe the device.\n\n453\n00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:13,734\nSo we can release it from\nWindows Intune as being managed,\n\n454\n00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:16,300\nand we can wipe the thing out.\n\n455\n00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,240\nNow, the passcode reset.\n\n456\n00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,820\nLet's say that the passcode that is\nused to unlock the device, if it was\n\n457\n00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,790\nrecently changed, if I'd forgotten it,\nthen I can reset that passcode from here.\n\n458\n00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,160\nAwfully convenient.\n\n459\n00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,360\nAnd then if it is lost somewhere or\nwhat not,\n\n460\n00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,700\nwe can remotely lock this device as well\nto keep people from getting into it.\n\n461\n00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n462\n00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,390\n>> Pretty fancy stuff.\n\n463\n00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,998\nNow with the Android device,\nwhen that one does connect up,\n\n464\n00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:44,900\nwe'll try to wipe it and see if this-\n>> And believe it or\n\n465\n00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,380\nnot, it has connected up now.\n\n466\n00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,130\n>> Already?\n>> Yeah.\n\n467\n00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,690\n>> Already?\n\n468\n00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n469\n00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,820\n>> Hm.\n>> Sure has.\n\n470\n00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,410\nAll right.\nSure enough.\n\n471\n00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,000\nYep.\n\n472\n00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000\nSo it did appear in there,\nit's just up there is Nathan Android Two.\n\n473\n00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,010\nSo it's not displaying\nits operating system yet.\n\n474\n00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,800\nIf we double click on it and\nwe go into its hardware.\n\n475\n00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,030\nYeah, so\nit's slowly pulling those items down.\n\n476\n00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:16,347\nNow, as far as policies, policies and\nthe things that we could push out to it,\n\n477\n00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:21,875\nreally it's the same as managing\nthe computers by adding the policies.\n\n478\n00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:27,902\nPolicies, at a policy.\n\n479\n00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:31,053\nAll right, clicking through here,\nwe can add those up and\n\n480\n00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:34,480\nthen push them out to our devices\nlike we've seen previously.\n\n481\n00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:37,383\nRight Ronnie?\n\n482\n00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:39,510\n>> Yep, sounds good here.\n\n483\n00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,520\n>> Hm.\n>> So for us here,\n\n484\n00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,370\nremember that a lot of times, this is the\nmanagement again for these devices that\n\n485\n00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,990\nreally don't have a good fit inside\nof our active directory domain,\n\n486\n00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,770\nthat we can now use Windows Intune again\nto manage wherever they actually are.\n\n487\n00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,800\nVery handy in terms of security.\n\n488\n00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,130\nIf these devices become lost,\nwe don't wanna lose the device,\n\n489\n00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,160\nbut at least the loss of\nthe device may not actually end up\n\n490\n00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,450\ngetting to the loss of actually\nall of the information on it.\n\n491\n00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,100\nNow that we have a management\napplication on there,\n\n492\n00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,780\nwe again can do things like remote wipe,\nwe again can actually limit it or\n\n493\n00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,346\nagain push out policy to say what these\ndevices can access and what they can't.\n\n494\n00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:17,610\nSo by being on a walk through here,\nyou actually see a lot more.\n\n495\n00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,945\nAnd so there was a lot more\nactually covered on this,\n\n496\n00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:25,630\nin terms of other episodes that we've\ndone in the server classes, I believe.\n\n497\n00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,560\nYep.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n498\n00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,142\n>> Okay.\n\n499\n00:23:27,142 --> 00:23:29,975\n>> All right, Ron, you know what,\nwe've got a few minutes left.\n\n500\n00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But from here we'll be switching gears\n\n501\n00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,040\nand getting into the the sync stuff.\n\n502\n00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,413\nSo let's go ahead and take a break here.\n\n503\n00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:43,045\nWe want to take our break and then when\nwe get back, we have offline files,\n\n504\n00:23:43,045 --> 00:23:48,154\nwe have sync center coming up, and\nlast that broadband tethering, sound good?\n\n505\n00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:48,793\nSounds great.\n\n506\n00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:49,477\n>> Sweet.\n\n507\n00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:52,785\nAll right, so we'll get into\nmore sync stuff after the break.\n\n508\n00:23:52,785 --> 00:24:00,319\n[MUSIC]\n\n509\n00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,680\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n510\n00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,700\nSo where we left off, right,\nso in Window's Intune and\n\n511\n00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,290\nmanaging those mobile devices, we did\ntouch just briefly on adding policies and\n\n512\n00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,015\npushing policies out\nto our mobile devices.\n\n513\n00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:18,820\nSo let's take a closer look at some of\nthose policies we did kind of gloss\n\n514\n00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,515\nover it so we'll get back into it.\n\n515\n00:24:20,515 --> 00:24:22,540\nAnd take a gander at them.\n\n516\n00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,540\nSo on our policy overview\nwhen we choose to\n\n517\n00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,350\nadd a policy we do have\nthese list of policies here.\n\n518\n00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,040\nAnd you know and\nwe did visit some of these before.\n\n519\n00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,410\nBut for the mobile device the security\npolicy we will go ahead and\n\n520\n00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,550\njust create a policy.\n\n521\n00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,050\nNow, we do have two items here,\n\n522\n00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,100\nwe can create and deploy with it\nwith the recommended settings.\n\n523\n00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,310\nMore times or not,\nit's pretty close to what we're after.\n\n524\n00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,040\nOr we can create a custom policy.\n\n525\n00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,970\nBut we'll choose the recommended settings.\n\n526\n00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,210\nGet an idea of the default\nstuff that we have on there.\n\n527\n00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,700\n>> Yeah, it really kind of is more\nlike a template for us right?\n\n528\n00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,380\nIt already has all we\nwould normally need here.\n\n529\n00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,770\nAnd usually modifying that is how we\nend up with custom policies anyways.\n\n530\n00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,415\n>> All right and so\nnow we pick our target group.\n\n531\n00:25:07,415 --> 00:25:12,500\nNow, so before we didn't really create\na lot of groups or structure in here so\n\n532\n00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,120\nwe're all just in the ungrouped users so\nwe'll add that on over, and click OK.\n\n533\n00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,070\nAnd that is just about it.\n\n534\n00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,130\nSo there is our default\npolicy that we have.\n\n535\n00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,490\nAnd we can highlight it and choose\nedit to see what is contained in here.\n\n536\n00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,515\nAnd there are a number of policy settings,\nright?\n\n537\n00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:32,076\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n538\n00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:36,150\n>> So got the name and\nthe description in there, and\n\n539\n00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,800\nnow of course we won't go\nthrough all of them but\n\n540\n00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,660\nwe'll just kinda briefly run through and\ntake a look at what's in there.\n\n541\n00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,570\nAll right, so\nwe do have the unlock passwords, right?\n\n542\n00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,180\nPassword to unlock\nthe device as specified.\n\n543\n00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,706\n>> You might want to zoom\nin on that [CROSSTALK]\n\n544\n00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:50,686\n>> Oh right, yeah.\n\n545\n00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:55,717\n[SOUND] All right,\nlet me minimize this and\n\n546\n00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:58,743\nget that utility going.\n\n547\n00:25:58,743 --> 00:25:59,288\nHere we go.\n\n548\n00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:09,679\nAll right, slowly slide the mouse over.\n\n549\n00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,080\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n550\n00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,560\n>> So, passwords to unlock the device\nthere, required password type, right.\n\n551\n00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,180\nOf characters, yeah, having six.\n\n552\n00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,970\nSo let me get out of that and\nfind some more stuff in there.\n\n553\n00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,240\nSo there are some policies here\nthat are not specified right.\n\n554\n00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,850\nPast their expiration right, our password\nhistory, and so Ronny, we talked in\n\n555\n00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,360\na previous episode about password\npolicies and those sorts of things.\n\n556\n00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,040\nSo we have our password history.\n\n557\n00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040\nPassword policy stuff.\n\n558\n00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,450\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n559\n00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,430\n>> Yeah.\nOh look,\n\n560\n00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,010\neven the idea of picture\npasswords is actually up there for\n\n561\n00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,130\nus to be able to configure or not as well.\n\n562\n00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,040\nAnd so for us the neat thing is\nif you're not sure whether or\n\n563\n00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,550\nnot your device actually\nsupports these polices,\n\n564\n00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,270\nyou can see over on the right hand side,\ninside the parentheses,\n\n565\n00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,510\nwhat devices you can actually\nmanage with some of those polices.\n\n566\n00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,220\nYou'll see some of them aren't actually\ngonna appear for you, so it's really nice.\n\n567\n00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,035\n>> Yeah so that one down there,\nallow fingerprint unlock, right.\n\n568\n00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:09,840\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, there you go, yeah\n\n569\n00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,232\n>> The finger print unlock with\n\n570\n00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,060\nthose iPhone 5, right.\n\n571\n00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,480\niPhone 5S, right, five?\n\n572\n00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,220\nFive or 5S, one of those.\n\n573\n00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,090\nYeah one of those.\n\n574\n00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:22,500\nYeah you can get the little\nfinger unlock on there, but\n\n575\n00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,180\nthere's just a number of policies.\n\n576\n00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,390\nAnd there,\nthen we can just quickly scroll down.\n\n577\n00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,289\nI mean there are many, many,\nmany really, really I guess,\n\n578\n00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:35,360\nfine grain this stuff and\nmanage what you want.\n\n579\n00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880\n>> Look, even your gaming there, Nate.\n\n580\n00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,920\nWhat would you do if they\nlocked you out on the gaming?\n\n581\n00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,520\n[LAUGH]\n>> Let's take a closer look at that one.\n\n582\n00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,905\nAllow Game Center friends\nare not [INAUDIBLE].\n\n583\n00:27:45,905 --> 00:27:48,645\nMulti-player gaming, not con-\n>> Oh, not configured.\n\n584\n00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:49,900\n>> Multi-player gaming?\n\n585\n00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,890\nThat's unheard of.\n\n586\n00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n587\n00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640\nWho does that?\n\n588\n00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,062\n>> All right, so we'll go to and\nsave this policy out.\n\n589\n00:27:55,062 --> 00:27:59,860\nAll right, it sounds good after\nit grinds its way out there.\n\n590\n00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,060\nNow, over in the Policy Conflicts tab,\nwe can see, right?\n\n591\n00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,220\nSo no conflicts.\n\n592\n00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,510\nExchange access.\n\n593\n00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,940\nNow we don't have exchange tied into here.\n\n594\n00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,970\nThough for those mobile devices that are\nalso connected to our exchange server for\n\n595\n00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,110\nthat active directory integration,\nwe can do with Windows Intune,\n\n596\n00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,260\nwe don't have that set up right now.\n\n597\n00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,740\nBut we can control that stuff here.\n\n598\n00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:32,110\nAnd in the overview so we do have, so\nit says one device with policy settings\n\n599\n00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,040\nerror, and we click on this and\nlet's find out what, what that is.\n\n600\n00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,030\nAll right, so that Android_2, that's\nthe one that we added on here before.\n\n601\n00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,080\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n602\n00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,005\nSo the password stuff.\n\n603\n00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:51,550\n[LAUGH] So the password stuff,\nit's not compliant, And\n\n604\n00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,380\nthere is no password on that tablet.\n\n605\n00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,210\n>> There you go.\n\n606\n00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,470\n>> So I mean you swipe to unlock and\nthat's it.\n\n607\n00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,970\nYou're in the device, and\nso that is against policy.\n\n608\n00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,150\nThat's cool that it poked\nthat out right here.\n\n609\n00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,810\n>> It kind of shows you it's amazing,\nright?\n\n610\n00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:09,580\nIn this one interface, how many\ndevices we can actually control and\n\n611\n00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,110\nthe depth that we see on those devices is\nalmost overwhelming to tell you the truth.\n\n612\n00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:22,450\n>> All right, so that's about as much\nthat we were planning on going in\n\n613\n00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,150\ntoday with the sync or the the mobile\ndevice policies using Windows Intune.\n\n614\n00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,740\nAll right, so\nnext what we have is Sync Center.\n\n615\n00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,770\nSync Center and\n\n616\n00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:37,090\noffline files, now we can sync up\nour files with those network shares.\n\n617\n00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,830\n>> Yeah, a lot of times within\nour networks we're gonna\n\n618\n00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,750\nactually have people that will be\nmoving in and out of the network, okay?\n\n619\n00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,190\nSo that means they're gonna either\nbe connecting network resources or\n\n620\n00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,660\nthey're gonna actually be out on the road\nsomewhere with there devices, but yet\n\n621\n00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,490\nthey still need access to some of the same\n\n622\n00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,910\nfiles that they would normally have access\nto if they were directly connected.\n\n623\n00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,510\nWell we can't really do that very often\nand today is probably where we can do it\n\n624\n00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,910\na little easier in terms of actually being\nable to build VPNs and connect back in.\n\n625\n00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,940\nThat's probably what you\nwill see more often.\n\n626\n00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,740\nBut the very fact is, we can also\nconfigure the idea of offline files that\n\n627\n00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,970\nwill allow my device, whether or not I\nactually have access to network or not, to\n\n628\n00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,800\nconnect to it, and to the user, if they're\nstill really connected to the network.\n\n629\n00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,950\nEven though we're actually connected\nto a hidden share on the computers.\n\n630\n00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,050\nThey come back online, then those files\nwill actually be able to sync up, and\n\n631\n00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,620\nthat user will actually probably think\nthat nothing has actually changed.\n\n632\n00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,750\n>> Now with our sync settings, so\n\n633\n00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,710\nSync Center is the utility that we go\nthrough to configure that stuff and\n\n634\n00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,560\nI guess we might as well just\njump right up into Sync Center.\n\n635\n00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,570\nAnd we'll take a look and\ndig around in there.\n\n636\n00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,700\nA quick one here, we get into our\nControl Panel, and there is Sync Center.\n\n637\n00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:02,180\nNow on this device here, so\nthere is this offline share.\n\n638\n00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,770\nRight.\n\n639\n00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,420\nAnd that one right there.\n\n640\n00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,510\nAll right, so lab files.\n\n641\n00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:11,280\nLab files it's hosted up\non the demand controller.\n\n642\n00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,070\nAnd with this little green icon here.\n\n643\n00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,050\nYou know what, are you connected\ninto your virtual machine?\n\n644\n00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,130\n>> I can be.\n\n645\n00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,630\n>> All right.\n\n646\n00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,320\nSo yeah so that little green circle there,\n\n647\n00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,280\nit signifies that we are syncing\nthe settings on here.\n\n648\n00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,930\nWe can right click on\nour network share and\n\n649\n00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,000\nright there always available\noffline is selected.\n\n650\n00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,100\nSo then the contents of this folder\nwill be synced to our device.\n\n651\n00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,765\nWe can get to it while it is off line.\n\n652\n00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:40,455\nAnd to manage that stuff,\nwe can get into Sync Center to do that.\n\n653\n00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:44,932\nNow let's say that we\nare a way off the network.\n\n654\n00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:48,790\nAnd that [INAUDIBLE] make\nchanges to some of these files.\n\n655\n00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,978\nAnd while we're away, other users\nmodify those same files as well.\n\n656\n00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:57,008\nWhen our computer comes back into contact,\nright, and then those files will\n\n657\n00:31:57,008 --> 00:32:00,920\nthen be synched up and\nwe'll get those synch conflicts in there.\n\n658\n00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,870\nNow, of the synch conflicts, right.\n\n659\n00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,379\nTo manage those guys, right,\nover there into View Synch Conflicts.\n\n660\n00:32:09,892 --> 00:32:12,470\nAll right now, of course,\nin this one we don't have any to go over.\n\n661\n00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,950\nThat would be in here.\n\n662\n00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,850\nIn the sync results.\n\n663\n00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,350\nRight, so.\n\n664\n00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,220\nYeah, sync concluded right there.\n\n665\n00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,810\nSo earlier this afternoon we\nhad those things right there.\n\n666\n00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,030\n>> You're signed in to my machine.\n\n667\n00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,780\n>> What's that?\nWho?\n\n668\n00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,330\nMe?\n>> Yeah.\n\n669\n00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,620\nAll right.\n\n670\n00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,400\n>> And, I've lost trust of the domain, so.\n\n671\n00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,580\nHm. [LAUGH] >> All right.\n\n672\n00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,424\nOh we had a lot of stress.\n\n673\n00:32:33,424 --> 00:32:34,805\n>> Yeah.\n>> With the secure channel.\n\n674\n00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:35,560\n>> Yep.\n\n675\n00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,685\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> With the secure channel.\n\n676\n00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:38,822\nYep.\n\n677\n00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:39,601\nTried.\n\n678\n00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:40,808\n>> Mm.\n\n679\n00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:41,469\n>> Yep.\n\n680\n00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:42,468\nThere it is.\n\n681\n00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:43,078\n>> All right.\nWell,\n\n682\n00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:44,295\nwe'll fix it [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n683\n00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,990\n>> All right.\n\n684\n00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,250\nSo for the, the settings right?\n\n685\n00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,750\nTo manage the offline files there.\n\n686\n00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,730\nWe can choose to disable the offline\nfiles all together in this right here.\n\n687\n00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,560\nWe can view the offline files, which,\n\n688\n00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,470\nthat we have in there on\nour mapped network drives.\n\n689\n00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,660\nAll right, so we've got those\nguys in there its 70% full.\n\n690\n00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,070\nIn the disk usage file, we can see\nhow much disk usage is spent on those\n\n691\n00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,150\nshared files in the temporary folders.\n\n692\n00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,030\nWe can delete the stuff out of there.\n\n693\n00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,340\nAnd as well as the encryption.\n\n694\n00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,630\nNow we can encrypt\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n695\n00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,230\n>> Our offline files.\n\n696\n00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,350\nLet's say that on our network share,\nit's for, let's say, I don't know,\n\n697\n00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,490\nsomething sensitive, I don't know,\nreports of some kind, right?\n\n698\n00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,270\n>> Right.\n>> Well, if we're syncing that stuff off,\n\n699\n00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,020\nso he can work on his reports while we're\naway from the network, if you know, our\n\n700\n00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,140\ncomputers compromised somehow, is lost,\nthen that's, that's company material.\n\n701\n00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,290\nAnd we don't really want\nthat to leave our network.\n\n702\n00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:45,600\nWell by encrypting that stuff, then if\nthat computer is off of the network and\n\n703\n00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,440\nsomebody could send to it,\nsure enough it is encrypted.\n\n704\n00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:54,955\nAnd then, for our network we can select,\nhow often it checks for a slow link.\n\n705\n00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:58,290\nCuz that will impact whether or\nnot our files are synced up.\n\n706\n00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:58,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n707\n00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,310\n>> All right, now,\n\n708\n00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:06,130\nwith like everything, group policy\ncan control our sync settings.\n\n709\n00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,530\n>> All right.\n\n710\n00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:12,009\n>> And to get into that, let's jump\nover to our good old gpedit.msc.\n\n711\n00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:24,365\nRight, and user configuration, right.\n\n712\n00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:25,390\n>> Yep.\n\n713\n00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,990\n>> Administrative templates.\n\n714\n00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,390\nInto network.\n\n715\n00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,120\nAnd offline files.\n\n716\n00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,326\nAnd minimize that so we can zoom in.\n\n717\n00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:43,264\nAll right, so\na few in here that we can call out.\n\n718\n00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:45,820\nMm, mm, mm.\n\n719\n00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:53,249\nAll right, well, I guess we'll\nhave to click on that, all right.\n\n720\n00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,150\nIs prevent the use of offline\nfiles folder altogether, right?\n\n721\n00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,680\n>> Right.\n\n722\n00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,540\n>> If for some reason we didn't want our\nusers to be pulling those files off or\n\n723\n00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,654\nsyncing them, taking them off the network,\nwe can control that guy here.\n\n724\n00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:09,186\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n725\n00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:12,990\n>> And into six.\n\n726\n00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,630\nThat is that.\n\n727\n00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,580\n>> Now remember the key here right,\nis that for consistency inside our domain.\n\n728\n00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,730\nWe're probably actually going\nto have pushed through.\n\n729\n00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,280\nThe idea of either using alpha1 files or\npreventing the use of this.\n\n730\n00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,520\nUsually the reason we might\nprevent this again is sometimes,\n\n731\n00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,520\nwhen we actually come back online we might\nactually override a particular file, and\n\n732\n00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,830\nwe don't want to do that.\n\n733\n00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,790\nSo we wanna make sure that for us here,\nwe at least know how to get access to\n\n734\n00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,705\nthe offline policy and manipulate and\ndo what actually you need to in terms of.\n\n735\n00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,770\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n736\n00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,240\nNow we can select our\nslow link policies and\n\n737\n00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,370\nif we are compared to text we\nare on a slow LAN connection.\n\n738\n00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,580\nWhether it's a, you know\n>> A satellite.\n\n739\n00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,960\n>> Satellite Connection.\n\n740\n00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,210\nThose sorts of things.\n\n741\n00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,670\nThat it won't try to pull those network\nfiles down and try to sync that stuff up\n\n742\n00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,030\nand really saturate that poor little\nbandwidth that we have on those.\n\n743\n00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,520\n>> Right and a lot of times depending\non those types of links right?\n\n744\n00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,800\nEspecially like those links might be what\nwe also could consider even metered links,\n\n745\n00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,850\nin terms of your data plan on your device\nthat you're actually offline, right?\n\n746\n00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,960\nSo if you have a limited amount of data\nthat you can actually transfer and\n\n747\n00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,390\nthe device is actually checking,\nlet's say,\n\n748\n00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,220\nevery five minutes whether or\nnot things have changed.\n\n749\n00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,820\nAgain, if somebody has actually\nchanged a lot of stuff here\n\n750\n00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,270\nit might sync up every five minutes and\nif it keep going on you're\n\n751\n00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,060\ngonna end up chewing through\nyour data plan fairly quickly.\n\n752\n00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,540\nEven on the satellite connection,\n\n753\n00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,490\nthere's a limited amount of\ndata that you have per month.\n\n754\n00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,340\nSo, again, having these things checked for\n\n755\n00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,520\nslow connections is also gonna be\npri again, very very efficient for\n\n756\n00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,216\nyou instead of having it actually eat\nup all your bandwidth for the month.\n\n757\n00:36:49,216 --> 00:36:51,820\n>> Mm.\nNow, speaking of of, of bandwidth, right?\n\n758\n00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,625\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n759\n00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:56,785\n>> So what about you know,\nthe broadband tethering?\n\n760\n00:36:56,785 --> 00:36:57,295\n>> Yep.\n\n761\n00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:58,345\n>> Right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n762\n00:36:58,345 --> 00:36:59,695\nFor us in, in today's world,\n\n763\n00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:03,705\nright, most of us will pretty much connect\nthrough a Wi-Fi connection, right.\n\n764\n00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:07,635\nWhether at work or whether you actually go\nout to Starbucks and get a cup of coffee,\n\n765\n00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:10,425\nusually you actually hit a lot of spots\nthat we have with Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\n766\n00:37:10,425 --> 00:37:11,875\nSo most of us are probably not so\n\n767\n00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,180\nconcerned with, but\nat that one point in time, okay.\n\n768\n00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,170\nUsing again Nate's favorite phrase,\nback in the day,\n\n769\n00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,750\nwe used to actually have what we called\nlike the broadband aircards right.\n\n770\n00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,300\nIs what we had.\n\n771\n00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,730\nSo, let's take a look at,\nI have a picture I,\n\n772\n00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,670\nI wish I actually had one we,\nwe tried this before and\n\n773\n00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,755\nwe, we weren't able to successfully\nfind it, so I'm gonna type in broadband.\n\n774\n00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:39,902\n[NOISE] aircard, oh look at that,\nthat actually lists it right there for us.\n\n775\n00:37:39,902 --> 00:37:43,585\nAnd so, here's, here's a fancy one that,\nthat Nate has always loved here.\n\n776\n00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:48,303\nThe good old Sprint 3G 4G aircard and so\nnotice the USB connector, to fit right\n\n777\n00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:52,812\ninto your laptop and then instead of\ngoing through a wireless access point,\n\n778\n00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:57,674\nyou'd actually go ahead and connect right\nthrough this onto your data plan on your\n\n779\n00:37:57,674 --> 00:38:01,338\nparticular, you know,\ntelephone carrier net, or\n\n780\n00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:06,580\ncellphone carrier network, and so they\ncame in all different shapes and sizes.\n\n781\n00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,680\nSome of them weren't, again,\nyou see a lot of USB ones here.\n\n782\n00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,020\nI'm trying to see if we have an older\none than they actually list, but\n\n783\n00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,760\nthey really don't, 'kay.\n\n784\n00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,370\nMost of the ones today\nare not even that anymore.\n\n785\n00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:22,050\nSo this actually allowed for\none device to connect in.\n\n786\n00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,650\nAnd that one is pretty much it.\n\n787\n00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,162\nMost of the ones that you see\nthere are the, what are they?\n\n788\n00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:26,696\nMiFis?\n\n789\n00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:28,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I think, is what we have here.\n\n790\n00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,950\nI'm gonna call it MiFi to,\n\n791\n00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:37,420\nto just annoy people at times here.\n\n792\n00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,150\nSo, from your cell phone carrier,\noh, here's one, really popular,\n\n793\n00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,220\nthat's out there.\n\n794\n00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,380\nRight?\nFrom your you know,\n\n795\n00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,700\nyour cellular carrier here.\n\n796\n00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,190\nAllows for multiple devices to\nconnect through this one device.\n\n797\n00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:51,350\nNotice that they don't actually\nneed a connection to a broadband\n\n798\n00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,480\nconnection somewhere.\n\n799\n00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,640\nThey can literally actually use the actual\ncarrier signal that is out there\n\n800\n00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,876\nto love us a direct connection\nthat we have, okay?\n\n801\n00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:03,480\nNow Windows 8.1 again can recognise, or\nhelp you to recognise the difference\n\n802\n00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,310\nbetween a connection like this and also,\njust a regular Wi-Fi collection, as well,\n\n803\n00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,395\nand they call it,\nthe idea of the metered network.\n\n804\n00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,770\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n805\n00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,345\nYeah, now, you know, metered connections.\n\n806\n00:39:13,345 --> 00:39:13,930\n>> Um-hm.\n\n807\n00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,950\n>> Metered connections are connections\nthat we specify as ones that\n\n808\n00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,645\nthat we pay for bandwidth.\n\n809\n00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:22,425\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now if you think of your standard old\n\n810\n00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:26,740\nWi-Fi, for the, the data that goes in and\nout of this laptop I,\n\n811\n00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,160\nI don't pay anything for\nit, right, it's all free.\n\n812\n00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,424\nWell, for metered connections,\nright, like a broadband aircard.\n\n813\n00:39:33,424 --> 00:39:34,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n814\n00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,790\n>> You know, generally, most providers,\nyou pay for the bandwidth that you use,\n\n815\n00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,450\nand, you know, I,\nI don't know the bandwidth with Verizon,\n\n816\n00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,130\ntwo,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n817\n00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,029\n>> Two gigs, four gigs.\n\n818\n00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:45,029\n>> Yeah.\n>> Something like that,\n\n819\n00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:47,040\nI guess depending on,\non the wireless plan.\n\n820\n00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,375\nFor the amount of data that you use,\nyou end up paying for.\n\n821\n00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:50,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n822\n00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,471\n>> Well, lets just say that on\nyour computer you have you know,\n\n823\n00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:58,077\nSynch Center set up to, you know,\nsynch all your files and,\n\n824\n00:39:58,077 --> 00:40:01,642\nSkyDrive is hooked up to sync\nall those files and settings.\n\n825\n00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:04,710\nAnd you're on the Microsoft account and\nit's syncing everything and\n\n826\n00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,991\nI mean it can be a lot of data going in\nand out and Windows store apps, right.\n\n827\n00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:08,661\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n828\n00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:11,820\n>> Live tiles updating, Windows updates.\n\n829\n00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,470\nThere can be a lot of information,\ngoing back and forth through this laptop.\n\n830\n00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,230\nAnd if it is on a metered connection, or\n\n831\n00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,030\nyou know on that AirCard,\nit can really burn through your data cap.\n\n832\n00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,910\n>> Yeah.\n>> So what do we do?\n\n833\n00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,410\nWell we can simply just set\nit as a metered connection.\n\n834\n00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n835\n00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,264\nSo on my little laptop\nhere I went ahead and\n\n836\n00:40:31,264 --> 00:40:33,991\npulled up how you normally\nwould go about doing this here.\n\n837\n00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:34,531\nRight.\n\n838\n00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:38,380\nSo when you do find your particular\nconnection to your networks.\n\n839\n00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,910\nAnd you notice there are a lot\nof networks around here.\n\n840\n00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,174\nI simple go down to my\nsystem tray here and\n\n841\n00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:48,570\nthen I can actually go ahead and\nclick on the network connections.\n\n842\n00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,530\nAnd from here I can right click and\nthis one's just on wireless here.\n\n843\n00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,830\nBut notice this says I can set this as\na metered connection, if I choose to.\n\n844\n00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,085\nAnd that way it again can\nactually help us out here,\n\n845\n00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:05,320\nto show us how much data we've actually\ngone through on that particular network.\n\n846\n00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,370\nLet me see if I can show you that.\n\n847\n00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,000\nNope.\n\n848\n00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,870\nThis one doesn't have it.\n\n849\n00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:12,775\nWhere is the, on the one that I have at\nhome that's set as the metered connection.\n\n850\n00:41:12,775 --> 00:41:17,703\nIt literary tells me how may gigabytes\nof data I've downloaded over the last\n\n851\n00:41:17,703 --> 00:41:18,545\n30 days.\n\n852\n00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:19,827\nRight there in the little summary.\n\n853\n00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:22,182\nSo that way I can actually take a look and\ngo,\n\n854\n00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:24,577\nhey this machine's actually gotten a lot.\n\n855\n00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:28,337\nThere are of course the ideas here that\nyou can actually set up even with Windows\n\n856\n00:41:28,337 --> 00:41:29,587\nitself, right?\n\n857\n00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:33,440\nEven with updates that you may not want\nto do this over a metered connection.\n\n858\n00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,000\nSo a lot of times you actually\nhave even settings like that.\n\n859\n00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,460\nThat, again, can really help you out\nin terms of those metered connections.\n\n860\n00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,250\nSo another way, another support\nthat you might actually have to do,\n\n861\n00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,790\nespecially if they're running close to\ntheir data cap limits all the time.\n\n862\n00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,999\n>> Yep.\nNow with good old Windows,\n\n863\n00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:52,463\nthere's more than one place\nto kinda set things, and\n\n864\n00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,450\nto configure these metered connections.\n\n865\n00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,120\n>> Right.\n\n866\n00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,018\n>> And a few of those, so we can\ntake a look at some of those places.\n\n867\n00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:04,660\nAll right and like Ronny said,\nyou can show us in through\n\n868\n00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,250\non the network spot, but\nwe can get and do our PC settings.\n\n869\n00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:16,040\nI mean, go down to network and\nthere is the WiFi, all right?\n\n870\n00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,740\nWe can click on this but\nlet me get connected to it first.\n\n871\n00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,040\nAll right.\n\n872\n00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,450\nAll right, there we go.\n\n873\n00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:42,308\nGet back in there to our PC settings and\nIn Tune network, all right,\n\n874\n00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:44,110\nso now we are connected.\n\n875\n00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,940\nWe can click on this guy, so there.\n\n876\n00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,206\nNow we get to this menu here.\n\n877\n00:42:48,206 --> 00:42:52,610\nAll right, data usage, so\nwe can turn that on and for\n\n878\n00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,930\nit to log how much data is going in and\nout of this device.\n\n879\n00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:02,670\nNow, so I'll go and bring this up, so\nI have cable internet at my house.\n\n880\n00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:08,910\nAnd it seems every month on my cable,\nI hit the bandwidth cap.\n\n881\n00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:14,060\nAnd I get this email with one week\nleft remaining in our billing cycle\n\n882\n00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,290\nsaying hey Mr. Copeland,\nyou have exceeded your bandwidth limit.\n\n883\n00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:22,784\nAnd a lot of times I don't think\nwe're really using that much data.\n\n884\n00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:25,607\nAnd so I would like to monitor how much it\n\n885\n00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:26,414\nis-\n>> Right.\n\n886\n00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:26,994\n>> going in and out.\n\n887\n00:43:26,994 --> 00:43:31,211\nAnd, of course, on the firewall I\nhave on the network as its own little\n\n888\n00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:34,170\nutilities in there that\nmeasure network usage.\n\n889\n00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,910\nBut let's say that I had an air card.\n\n890\n00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:36,570\nAll right?\n\n891\n00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:41,656\nA little USB device plug in air card, and\nI'm getting a letter from Sprint saying,\n\n892\n00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:46,910\nhey sorry you can't use your device, we'll\nget more antennas up, no just kidding.\n\n893\n00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:47,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n894\n00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,240\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, they say hey you know,\n\n895\n00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,330\nyou blew through your data cap.\n\n896\n00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,790\nYou owe us hundreds of dollars or\nfor, for blowing over.\n\n897\n00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:53,660\n>> Yeah.\n\n898\n00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,240\n>> Well how can you really track it?\n\n899\n00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,030\n>> Yeah.\n\n900\n00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,910\n>> Well, you can with Windows 8.1.\n\n901\n00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,660\nWith that option right there.\n\n902\n00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,160\nAnd then for this NH Studio,\nthe network there.\n\n903\n00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,500\nAll right, we set it as a meter\nconnection and turn those properties on.\n\n904\n00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,120\nAnd another place we can\ncheck on that stuff.\n\n905\n00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,691\nLet's click on back here and\n\n906\n00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:21,310\nin PC Settings, PC and\n\n907\n00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:26,080\nDevices and down in Devices.\n\n908\n00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,910\nAll right.\n\n909\n00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:27,870\n>> That went over metered guests.\n\n910\n00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:31,878\n>> All right, so\nWindows 8.1 when you connect devices,\n\n911\n00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:35,815\nlet's say if it's a printer,\nor a blue tooth mouse.\n\n912\n00:44:35,815 --> 00:44:36,455\nLike this one.\n\n913\n00:44:36,455 --> 00:44:41,205\nIt will go and\nit will download device software for it.\n\n914\n00:44:41,205 --> 00:44:44,543\nIf it needs some, or\nupdate the drivers and\n\n915\n00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:49,285\nproperties for these devices and\nit does it automatically.\n\n916\n00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:50,375\n>> Right.\nPretty sweet,\n\n917\n00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,330\nunless you're on a metered connection.\n\n918\n00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:54,330\nSo, you can check this.\n\n919\n00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,820\nHey, don't download any of this\nstuff on a metered connection.\n\n920\n00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,330\nSo, we can turn that on right there.\n\n921\n00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,630\nAnd then, another place.\n\n922\n00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,950\nThat way we can get that into one drive.\n\n923\n00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,900\nDown there in metered connections.\n\n924\n00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,570\n>> There we go.\n>> And in here, these are for\n\n925\n00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,805\nthe settings for One Drive, all right, One\nDrive where we can stick all of our files\n\n926\n00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:19,910\nand folders and those sorts of\nthings up in to cloud storage.\n\n927\n00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,490\n>> Nice.\n\n928\n00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:25,540\nAnd we need to set these on whether or\nnot we want to sync them.\n\n929\n00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,630\nNow we have two settings here.\n\n930\n00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,680\nUpload and\ndownload over a metered connection.\n\n931\n00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,850\nUpload and download over a metered\nconnection when I'm roaming.\n\n932\n00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:38,900\nSo roaming just like on a wireless\ncarrier right, for a cell phone.\n\n933\n00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,120\nRoaming is when you're\noff your home network.\n\n934\n00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,790\nNow, with my wireless carrier, they don't\ncharge extra for it when you're roaming.\n\n935\n00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,820\nI'm not sure if carriers do anymore.\n\n936\n00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,740\nBut you know,\nback in the early days of wireless plans.\n\n937\n00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,870\n[CROSSTALK] If you were roaming,\nyou were paying for it.\n\n938\n00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,700\nOh yeah.\n\n939\n00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,740\nAnd so nowadays I think\nroaming is pretty much gone.\n\n940\n00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,740\nI guess you get like\nfree domestic roaming.\n\n941\n00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,240\n>> Yeah.\n\n942\n00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,990\n>> With almost every plan, but anyhow.\n\n943\n00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,266\nYeah generally when you are roaming you're\nusing more minutes, or not more minutes,\n\n944\n00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,740\nbut special minutes and\nare paying more for them.\n\n945\n00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,080\nSo we can turn this off\nwhen you are roaming.\n\n946\n00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,090\nThat's what that there is for.\n\n947\n00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:23,990\nAnd, you know with metered connection\ndrives let's go back into our network.\n\n948\n00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,560\n>> Right.\n\n949\n00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,320\n>> Right.\n\n950\n00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,580\n>> So we click on this and\nwe can set that as a meter connection.\n\n951\n00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,590\nLet's say for our ethernet, right?\n\n952\n00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:34,910\nBut there is there is no\nmeter connection do you.\n\n953\n00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,620\n>> Oh there you go.\n\n954\n00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,490\n>> Do you know how I can set this,\nas a metered connection?\n\n955\n00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,910\n>> I do not know how you can set\nthis as a metered connection.\n\n956\n00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,900\n>> [LAUGH] Right, well, you can't.\n\n957\n00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,660\nIt's a trick question.\n\n958\n00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,290\nSorry.\n\n959\n00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:44,910\n>> That's why I said that.\n\n960\n00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,089\n>> So wired connections, you cannot\nset those as a meter connection,\n\n961\n00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:50,860\nit's just not possible.\n\n962\n00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,500\n>> Yeah.\n\n963\n00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,100\n>> Now when you do set things\nas a meter connections,\n\n964\n00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,310\nthere are some things in Windows\nthat happen in the background.\n\n965\n00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:00,327\n>> Yep.\n>> Windows Update will only download\n\n966\n00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:02,070\npriority updates.\n\n967\n00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,620\n>> That's it.\n>> Very important updates.\n\n968\n00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,900\nIt will download those.\n\n969\n00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,370\nThe live tiles, right?\n\n970\n00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:11,490\nSo if you do have any live\ntiles those won't update.\n\n971\n00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,030\nThose will be parked.\n\n972\n00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,040\n>> Oh, rats.\n\n973\n00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,740\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n974\n00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,330\nYeah.\n\n975\n00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:19,440\nOffline files, depending on the policies\nthat you set for offline files.\n\n976\n00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,862\nThose guys will no longer sync.\n\n977\n00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:26,469\n>> And then any Windows stores apps,\nif there are anything downloading or\n\n978\n00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:31,470\nupdating for Windows store apps,\nthose will be paused and they will wait.\n\n979\n00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,967\n>> Yeah.\n>> Until you get back on a regular\n\n980\n00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:33,580\nconnection.\n\n981\n00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n982\n00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,018\n>> So you can see where, where Windows\n8 itself was really designed for\n\n983\n00:47:39,018 --> 00:47:43,269\nthat kind of middle ground of the idea\nof a laptop and a desktop but\n\n984\n00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:48,664\nreally was designed to be super efficient\nwith the idea of these mobile devices.\n\n985\n00:47:48,664 --> 00:47:52,889\nIs where we're starting to see why all\nthese segments are actually there.\n\n986\n00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:56,155\nSo again there's a lot of features for\nus and again it's a big push for\n\n987\n00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:58,420\nus to actually move that\nway towards mobility.\n\n988\n00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,570\n>> All right, well we are coming\nright up on our break we do have\n\n989\n00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:08,280\none more item to get to and\nwe'll get to it, oh wait, yeah?\n\n990\n00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:08,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n991\n00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,710\n>> Okay, I thought you said something.\n\n992\n00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,700\nI'm sorry.\n>> Yeah, it's fine.\n\n993\n00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,473\nYeah.\n>> All right, we've got work folders,\n\n994\n00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,830\nso folders are coming up.\n\n995\n00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,618\nSo we'll go ahead and\ntake our break now and when we get back,\n\n996\n00:48:18,618 --> 00:48:20,118\nmore stuff after this.\n\n997\n00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:27,454\n[MUSIC]\n\n998\n00:48:27,454 --> 00:48:29,266\nAll right, welcome back.\n\n999\n00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:33,450\nAll right, so where we left off, we're\njust beginning to talk about work folders.\n\n1000\n00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,322\n>> Yeah.\n>> Work folders.\n\n1001\n00:48:35,322 --> 00:48:39,860\n>> Yeah, the idea of work folders for\nus really, hate to say it,\n\n1002\n00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,030\ncan replace the idea of the sync center.\n\n1003\n00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:47,190\nThe sync stuff that we're\nessentially talking about, okay.\n\n1004\n00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:52,640\nThe ability to actually have the idea\nof sharing the information here and\n\n1005\n00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,570\nwe can actually do it\nwithin the network and\n\n1006\n00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,260\nalso of course with devices\nthat are not inside.\n\n1007\n00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,830\nSo, we can actually have a single user\nthat might have a home computer set up.\n\n1008\n00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:04,980\nWe can have a user that actually has\na workstation computer set up and\n\n1009\n00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,275\nthey want actually share\nthe files in between them.\n\n1010\n00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:08,580\nWell I have it at home,\n\n1011\n00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,500\nthat particular computer is not\ngonna be joined to the domain, okay?\n\n1012\n00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,740\nAnd so, but I still need to get access\nto maybe those particular files.\n\n1013\n00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,360\nSo we can instead set up what we\ncall the idea of work folders for\n\n1014\n00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,010\nus to be able to do that.\n\n1015\n00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:24,650\nNow, in the background there is a lot of\nother infrastructure that has to be set up\n\n1016\n00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,120\nto do this, okay?\n\n1017\n00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,950\nSo, we already have previously\nconfigured that in terms of our say,\n\n1018\n00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,070\nif I've done it correctly and\n\n1019\n00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:36,030\nthere's no guarantee of that, if I've done\nit correctly here, everything should work\n\n1020\n00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:40,350\nfine in terms of actually being\nable to use the work folders.\n\n1021\n00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:45,390\nYou have to set up a work share, a network\nshare, that network share then of course,\n\n1022\n00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,230\nhas to be identified as a work folder.\n\n1023\n00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,330\nAnd from that point,\nthat work folder has to be published out\n\n1024\n00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:54,009\nas being a work folder that\nthen users can access.\n\n1025\n00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,580\n>> All right.\n\n1026\n00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,350\nSo for this demonstration we\nare using one of the TechNet labs.\n\n1027\n00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:07,090\nFor folders and there's certificates in\nthe background and all sorts of things.\n\n1028\n00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:11,712\nTo run through on what a client\nhas to go through these labs\n\n1029\n00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:16,230\nthey work out great for\nwhat we use them for.\n\n1030\n00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,280\n>> Right.\n\n1031\n00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,470\nSo from here this is our first client,\nthis is actually going to simulate\n\n1032\n00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,130\nthe idea of a workstation\nwithin our own network, okay?\n\n1033\n00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:30,960\nSo we already have this computer\njoined up where you can see Ben Smith.\n\n1034\n00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,100\nHe's in this fictitious network\nthat we call Contoso here.\n\n1035\n00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,430\nAnd then all I have to do is\nactually remember the password.\n\n1036\n00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,570\nI didn't remember the password.\n\n1037\n00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:53,330\nAnd then login and we don't worry\nabout the actual notification there.\n\n1038\n00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:58,090\nAgain, the labs they were set up on\na very trial basis at that point\n\n1039\n00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,360\nwhen they were first set up here so\nhere we are, okay?\n\n1040\n00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,140\nNow in terms of Windows at\nthis point right, okay?\n\n1041\n00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,120\nI need to actually go to the desktop and\nyou can see where they've gone ahead and\n\n1042\n00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,505\nset up a shortcut link right here, okay?\n\n1043\n00:51:11,505 --> 00:51:13,100\n>> All right,\n\n1044\n00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,160\nnow that shortcut link, that guy in there\nthat will lead out to our work folders.\n\n1045\n00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:24,132\nSo the first thing let's grab some files\nand let's dump it into that work folder.\n\n1046\n00:51:24,132 --> 00:51:25,690\n>> All right, let's see.\n\n1047\n00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:31,300\n>> So we're going into our file explorer,\nwe go in there and we go into lab\n\n1048\n00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:37,120\nfiles and sync share files,\nsure let's just grab all those.\n\n1049\n00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:37,620\n>> All right.\n\n1050\n00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:48,230\n>> Let's open up that short cut there on\nthe desktop and in that work folders,\n\n1051\n00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,990\nfolder there, that last item which like\nwork folder with an S, down below it.\n\n1052\n00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:57,240\nYeah, all right,\nlet's place all that stuff in there.\n\n1053\n00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,720\n>> Okay.\nNow, this initial configuration\n\n1054\n00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,520\nwas actually pushed out\nthrough group policy.\n\n1055\n00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,100\nAnd we actually have this setting\nhere that tells it to go ahead and\n\n1056\n00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,440\nautomatically do this for\n\n1057\n00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,630\nall of the actual computers\nwithin our domain here, okay?\n\n1058\n00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,440\nSo every user that actually has this\nunderneath their profile by default,\n\n1059\n00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,020\nthey'll now have access to\nthese work folders as well.\n\n1060\n00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,880\nSo, this way Ben Smith can\nagain be working on his stuff\n\n1061\n00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,050\nat the end of the day, right?\n\n1062\n00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,279\nHere it is, just the 5 o'clock hour, he's\ngetting a little bit itchy for happy hour.\n\n1063\n00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:25,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He knows that there are still a few\n\n1064\n00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,650\nthings that he should be able to do.\n\n1065\n00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:32,345\nSo he says, let me save this for work into\nmy work folder okay, why would he do that.\n\n1066\n00:52:32,345 --> 00:52:36,375\nBecause, he's actually been told\nwe have work folders enabled and\n\n1067\n00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:40,615\nthat means what, if his computer\nat home is set up correctly\n\n1068\n00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:44,760\nthen he could also connect\nin to be able to do this.\n\n1069\n00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,940\nPretty neat.\n\n1070\n00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:50,400\n>> Yeah, yeah, log in from your house\ncomputer that's not joined to the domain\n\n1071\n00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,150\nand go to access some of\nthese work documents.\n\n1072\n00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,310\n>> Yeah, all right.\n\n1073\n00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:58,840\n>> So okay, so now that those guys are in\nthere let's get into the control panel.\n\n1074\n00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,660\nThere's a shortcut down there on your\ntaskbar, click on that and down at\n\n1075\n00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,900\nthe very bottom, for in the W's, for work\nfolders, let's double click on that icon.\n\n1076\n00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:14,480\nAll right, and so right here will give us\na summary on almost what's going down.\n\n1077\n00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,686\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yep.\n\n1078\n00:53:15,686 --> 00:53:20,350\n>> So we see that it has been synced and\nyeah, so\n\n1079\n00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:24,428\nwe have no errors,\nusually green bars are good.\n\n1080\n00:53:24,428 --> 00:53:27,930\n>> Yeah, I'm just trying to make sure we\ncould actually see what we could see, but\n\n1081\n00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:32,140\nI just realized I don't have\nthe zoom tool actually enabled here.\n\n1082\n00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:32,810\n>> All right.\n\n1083\n00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,630\n>> I thought I did,\nthat's what I get for thinking.\n\n1084\n00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:38,960\nThere we go.\n\n1085\n00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,670\n>> Nice.\n\n1086\n00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:43,580\n>> Okay, so you can see right now on the\nserver what's actually available to us and\n\n1087\n00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,680\nthe work files that were\nactually last synced.\n\n1088\n00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,950\nThese again are actually\nwhat we have there, okay.\n\n1089\n00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,390\nNotice that it even gives us that\nmetered connection idea, okay.\n\n1090\n00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,180\n>> And so even if I'm actually on\nthis we can do that, of course.\n\n1091\n00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,920\nNotice that there are actually\nother things in terms of email and\n\n1092\n00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,370\nsupport if we need to.\n\n1093\n00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,790\nSo here we go, so\n\n1094\n00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:03,960\nthe idea of actually having the work\nfolders here synchronization is happening,\n\n1095\n00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,620\nyou can even see where they've\ngot the shared files oops.\n\n1096\n00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,430\nSo this is getting close to\nthat time where it's about to\n\n1097\n00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,370\nprobably come into trouble with us here so\nthere we are.\n\n1098\n00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:19,150\nOkay, so these folders are now on\nthe individual workstation and\n\n1099\n00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,202\nnow they decide that they\nare ready to go home.\n\n1100\n00:54:22,202 --> 00:54:25,540\n>> All right, so\ngood old Ben Smith right, so he logs out.\n\n1101\n00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:30,142\nAnd he heads over to his computer at\nthe house says clicks on client two.\n\n1102\n00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:35,080\nAll right,\nthis is Ben Smith's computer at the house.\n\n1103\n00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,250\nAnd then let's click on the desktop icon,\nhead over there.\n\n1104\n00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:38,820\n>> All right.\n\n1105\n00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,900\n>> All right.\n\n1106\n00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,750\nNow, for his computer, right?\n\n1107\n00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:46,570\nSo it's not joined to the domain, for\nthis computer to be able to trust the work\n\n1108\n00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:53,210\nfolder setup and for it to connect out\nthere, we have to import a certificate.\n\n1109\n00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,957\nAnd the certificate you would get from\nadministrator went out at his workplace.\n\n1110\n00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:00,553\nAll right.\n\n1111\n00:55:00,553 --> 00:55:01,530\n>> Yep.\n\n1112\n00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:05,630\n>> And so, in there,\nright, let's click on,\n\n1113\n00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:10,490\nlet's go to, so these certificates we're\non our local computer there, alright.\n\n1114\n00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:16,570\nAnd then let's click on those\ncertificated and all task.\n\n1115\n00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:17,170\n>> Yep.\n\n1116\n00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,615\n>> So inside the trusted root\nis where we're gonna go.\n\n1117\n00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:23,610\nRight-click on certificates, go to all\ntask, and we're gonna select import.\n\n1118\n00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,640\n>> All right?\n\n1119\n00:55:26,722 --> 00:55:30,988\nAll right, let's click on Next\nthrough that and on browse.\n\n1120\n00:55:33,473 --> 00:55:36,888\nIn here, let's find the lab files.\n\n1121\n00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:42,265\nIt's in local disk C and lab files here.\n\n1122\n00:55:42,265 --> 00:55:43,775\nAnd there it is.\n\n1123\n00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:45,020\nYep, there's our certificate.\n\n1124\n00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,460\n>> Yep, let's open that guy up.\n\n1125\n00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,553\n>> Yeah, make sure everybody can see it so\nI'm not lying to them.\n\n1126\n00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:52,710\nThe icons are small enough on desktop.\n\n1127\n00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:56,435\nBut, on this thing, it's extremely tiny.\n\n1128\n00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:57,597\nAll right.\n\n1129\n00:55:57,597 --> 00:55:58,980\nI wanna click next.\n\n1130\n00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,950\nNext, and finished.\n\n1131\n00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:01,290\n>> Yep.\n>> So remember,\n\n1132\n00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:05,130\nwe're gonna actually place this in\nour trusted root, certificates here.\n\n1133\n00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,510\nThat's where we actually need to place it.\n\n1134\n00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,000\nBecause, well,\n\n1135\n00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,830\nwe can't actually accept the certificate\nif we don't trust it already.\n\n1136\n00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,830\nSo there we go and we'll click Finish.\n\n1137\n00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:19,560\nAnd then we go,\nwe're just waiting for the magic\n\n1138\n00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,075\nlittle pop up here that tells us that\nthe certificate was successfully imported.\n\n1139\n00:56:24,075 --> 00:56:25,500\nIt's what we're actually doing.\n\n1140\n00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,040\nOkay?\n\n1141\n00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,810\nSo once we actually see that we should\nsee a ca-contoso.com certificate,\n\n1142\n00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,000\nif it ever comes up.\n\n1143\n00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,890\nDid I click cancel by accident.\n\n1144\n00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,090\nI didn't realize it.\n\n1145\n00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,380\n>> We'll give it a minute here\n>> All right.\n\n1146\n00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,200\nThere we go.\n\n1147\n00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,589\n>> There we go so import was successful.\n\n1148\n00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:44,620\nAll right.\n>> And we can see it right there on the.\n\n1149\n00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,370\nYeah, sorry.\n>> Go ahead.\n\n1150\n00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,410\n>> Yeah so, yep, there's the Canstoso-CA.\n\n1151\n00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,140\nSo we're in there, now we trust that guy.\n\n1152\n00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,580\n>> Yep.\n>> Now it's time to move onto\n\n1153\n00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,730\nthe next step.\n\n1154\n00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:54,800\nSo, let's get into the Control Panel.\n\n1155\n00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:58,955\nAnd we'll head back into that work folder,\nat the very bottom.\n\n1156\n00:57:03,648 --> 00:57:07,700\nWork folders, yep.\nAnd let's set up work folders.\n\n1157\n00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,960\nNow on the domain, the domain joined PC.\n\n1158\n00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,610\nRight?\n\n1159\n00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,360\nIt was already set up.\n\n1160\n00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,729\nAnd it was set up by\ngetting that group policy.\n\n1161\n00:57:16,729 --> 00:57:19,750\nSo we pushed out policy\nto that machine and\n\n1162\n00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,670\nit set everything up in the background.\n\n1163\n00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:22,230\n>> Right.\n\n1164\n00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,900\nYeah.\n\n1165\n00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,420\nHere, because we're actually on a computer\nthat's not joined to the domain.\n\n1166\n00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,230\nWe went ahead and\nwe needed to establish that trust and\n\n1167\n00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,370\nthat's what the certificate\nhelps us to do.\n\n1168\n00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,020\nAnd now we have to manually set this up.\n\n1169\n00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,770\nSo notice that there were two ways.\n\n1170\n00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:38,270\nIf I didn't want to actually have the idea\nof people manually having to do this\n\n1171\n00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,250\non the domain,\n\n1172\n00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,400\nI can use a group policy to automatically\nenforce this and push it out.\n\n1173\n00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,920\nBut if I want them to actually\nmanually select it they would see\n\n1174\n00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,140\nthe same thing here.\n\n1175\n00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,140\nRegardless of whether they are actually\non a domain joined computer or not.\n\n1176\n00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,220\nOkay?\n\n1177\n00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,970\nSo from there I simply go ahead and\nselect set up work folder.\n\n1178\n00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,470\nWell, maybe.\n\n1179\n00:57:57,303 --> 00:57:58,389\nClick on it.\n\n1180\n00:57:58,389 --> 00:57:58,979\nThat one actually helped.\n\n1181\n00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:03,860\nAnd on the email address\nthis is gonna be Ben.\n\n1182\n00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,010\nHopefully I can spell it correctly.\n\n1183\n00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:06,510\nBen Smith.\n\n1184\n00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:08,885\nYeah.\n\n1185\n00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,818\n>> At at contoso.com.\n\n1186\n00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:15,763\n>> contoso.com.\n\n1187\n00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:17,327\n>> Our next.\n\n1188\n00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,290\nAnd if everything works right, so yep, so\n\n1189\n00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:23,140\nwith this pop-up we\nare on the right track.\n\n1190\n00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:23,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n1191\n00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,900\nSo we'll put in Ben's name.\n\n1192\n00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,720\nRight?\nOr his, his username bensmith@contosa.com.\n\n1193\n00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,968\n>> It's just ben.smith?\n\n1194\n00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,380\nWe always want it's ben.smith?\n\n1195\n00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,780\n>> Correct.\n>> Okay.\n\n1196\n00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,330\nI just wanna make sure.\n\n1197\n00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:41,563\n>> Yep.\nbensmith@contosa.com, and his password.\n\n1198\n00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:42,200\nRight?\n\n1199\n00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,300\nSame password as before.\n\n1200\n00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,738\n>> Oh, I have to remember.\n\n1201\n00:58:46,738 --> 00:58:53,390\n[LAUGH]\nYeah.\n\n1202\n00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,110\n>> All right.\n\n1203\n00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,500\n>> All right.\nSo pretty good.\n\n1204\n00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,342\nYeah we're doing pretty good so far.\n\n1205\n00:58:57,342 --> 00:58:58,040\n>> All right.\n\n1206\n00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,090\nSo now let's click on next\non that window there.\n\n1207\n00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:03,130\n>> And before we do, let's see where,\nwhere it actually goes too.\n\n1208\n00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:04,200\nRight?\nOkay?\n\n1209\n00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,910\nSo, for us here, by default,\n\n1210\n00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:11,020\nit's set it up really exactly in the same\nlocation as we had inside domain.\n\n1211\n00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,430\nIt went under that users folder, and\ninside of that user and his profile, and\n\n1212\n00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:16,480\nnow you actually see where is, Ben Smith,\n\n1213\n00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,360\nnot that particular machine name that we\nhave and then slash work folders here.\n\n1214\n00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,090\nOkay?\n\n1215\n00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:28,190\nSo it always goes over individual users\nand this is also kind of idea for us too.\n\n1216\n00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,530\nIf you set this up in group posse you have\nto go the user configuration settings.\n\n1217\n00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:35,490\nIf you go to the computer\nconfiguration settings you're gonna\n\n1218\n00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,690\nbe sadly disappointed.\n\n1219\n00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,300\nThe only thing that's gonna tell\nyou to do is automatically do it.\n\n1220\n00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,540\nBut for us here, this actually\ngives us the ability to specify\n\n1221\n00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,720\nwhere we actually wanna actually,\npull the information from\n\n1222\n00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,670\nas well as that should be able to\nenforce it automatically want to.\n\n1223\n00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,080\nUsually for us,\nit's gonna be set up here by default.\n\n1224\n00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,050\nYou can change it a lot of times but\n\n1225\n00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:55,650\nthis one actually doesn't\ngive us the ability to.\n\n1226\n00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:57,561\n>> All right.\n\n1227\n01:00:01,316 --> 01:00:04,220\nAll right.\nAnd then on that window there, yep.\n\n1228\n01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,080\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n1229\n01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,600\nSecurity policies, right?\n\n1230\n01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,050\nSo, what it's going to do,\nit will encrypt these work folders.\n\n1231\n01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:14,480\nSo, if it is a shared computer,\nso let's say, Sally.\n\n1232\n01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,340\nSally goes and sits down at Ronnie's PC.\n\n1233\n01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,860\nShe would not be able\nto his work folders and\n\n1234\n01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,940\nable to see these documents\nthat are being seen to cross.\n\n1235\n01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:24,540\nSo it does encrypt that stuff.\n\n1236\n01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,440\nAll right, so, it does require\na password assigned to your PC,\n\n1237\n01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,390\nwhich, which Ben Smith, he does.\n\n1238\n01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:29,940\nRight?\n>> All right.\n\n1239\n01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:32,050\n>> And automatically lock it, that's good.\n\n1240\n01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,770\nAnd erase all those work folders.\n\n1241\n01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:35,740\nIf you lose this pc.\n\n1242\n01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,090\n>> That's probably the important one.\n\n1243\n01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:37,670\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1244\n01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,260\n>> Yeah and the very fact is even all\nthese other ones you got to what,\n\n1245\n01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,470\nwhat's the big difference here big deal?\n\n1246\n01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,590\nBut that erasing one gives us control.\n\n1247\n01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,180\nEven outside of the network.\n\n1248\n01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:50,250\nSo, this is where you have the disgruntled\nemployee and he's got work files at home.\n\n1249\n01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,210\nHe thinks he's ready, rushing home.\n\n1250\n01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:54,040\nWe actually have the ability now,\n\n1251\n01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,840\nto not only have the,\nthe information that we have, but\n\n1252\n01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:01,760\nnotice the ability to erase those,\nif we actually need to, on the spot.\n\n1253\n01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1254\n01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:05,720\n>> All right.\nSo let's agree to those policies and\n\n1255\n01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,590\nclick on the box.\n\n1256\n01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:08,080\nYep, I agree and accept.\n\n1257\n01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,928\n>> And accept the setup and work folders.\n\n1258\n01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:16,090\n>> And there we go.\n>> All right.\n\n1259\n01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,840\nSo on the desktop there.\n\n1260\n01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,195\nSo we do have a that,\nBen Smith folder there.\n\n1261\n01:01:21,195 --> 01:01:22,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Ben's work folder.\n\n1262\n01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:28,180\nAnd open that up and\ninto the work folder, right down, yep.\n\n1263\n01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:28,990\n>> There they are.\n\n1264\n01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:29,840\n>> All right, so we are.\n\n1265\n01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,525\nSo now, it is now syncing with\nhis machine, at the office.\n\n1266\n01:01:33,525 --> 01:01:36,360\n>> Yeah, so this gives us that\nability again, remember that\n\n1267\n01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,290\neven if we actually have computers\nthat are not joined on the domain.\n\n1268\n01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:39,890\nOkay?\n\n1269\n01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,010\nBut notice I'm actually syncing up and\ndoing these.\n\n1270\n01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:45,740\nSo you hate to say it, it works very\nsimilar to the way that the sync center\n\n1271\n01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,140\nthat we were just talking about works,\nbut this one a little bit more control.\n\n1272\n01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:52,000\nAnd the very fact that we can\ndelete the files that we need to.\n\n1273\n01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,590\nWe can enforce other certain\npolicies through it, and\n\n1274\n01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,855\nthat actually gives us a live\nconnection here fairly easily.\n\n1275\n01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:57,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1276\n01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,320\n>> Yeah\n>> Yeah, definitely, you know, and\n\n1277\n01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,970\nwith work folders one thing that, is,\n\n1278\n01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,110\nthat's pretty neat,\nwe can set up file screens.\n\n1279\n01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,540\n>> Nice.\n>> On these things as well.\n\n1280\n01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:08,570\nSo we can control which files\nthat are being synched out there.\n\n1281\n01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:11,620\n>> Right.\n>> So we want to restrict and, I don't\n\n1282\n01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:15,510\nknow, MP3s or who knows what then yeah\nset up file screens control that stuff.\n\n1283\n01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:17,770\nSo yeah, it's pretty sweet stuff.\n\n1284\n01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty fancy\n\n1285\n01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,625\n>> Those require a bit of setup.\n\n1286\n01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:22,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right a bit more setup than\n\n1287\n01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:25,710\njust right clicking something and\nsaying make flying.\n\n1288\n01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:26,391\nYeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1289\n01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:28,660\n>> So that's yeah a bit more than that.\n\n1290\n01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,350\n>> Yeah, a little more infrastructure.\n\n1291\n01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:33,740\nYou know but once again once it's setup\nyou know the good thing is you only really\n\n1292\n01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,450\nhave to set it up once and\nthat particular instance here.\n\n1293\n01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,530\nAs long as it's set up correctly\nit works just like this.\n\n1294\n01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:43,090\nYou can see someone like me can actually\nset this up, relatively simply.\n\n1295\n01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,592\n>> Yeah that's true.\n\n1296\n01:02:44,592 --> 01:02:47,150\n>> I know.\n>> Now as far as like potential pit falls.\n\n1297\n01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:49,200\nAnd things where this stuff can break.\n\n1298\n01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,840\nIt does rely on certificates.\n\n1299\n01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,110\nAnd for Ben's domain,\njoint computer it does require or\n\n1300\n01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,305\ndoes rely on receiving that group policy.\n\n1301\n01:02:57,305 --> 01:02:58,630\n>> Right.\n>> So the work folders,\n\n1302\n01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:01,660\nif it's not being, I guess,\npushed out properly.\n\n1303\n01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,220\nIt could be that his machine,\nit's not getting policy.\n\n1304\n01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:04,720\n>> Right.\n\n1305\n01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,650\n>> And now, well why it's not\ngetting policy well heaven sakes\n\n1306\n01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,380\n>> [LAUGH] Who could know\n\n1307\n01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,850\n>> Could be a number of things.\n\n1308\n01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:11,350\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1309\n01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:13,040\n>> That secure channel that we talked\n\n1310\n01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,150\nabout previously.\n\n1311\n01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,744\nIt could be that.\n\n1312\n01:03:14,744 --> 01:03:15,346\n>> Yeah.\n\n1313\n01:03:15,346 --> 01:03:17,630\n>> If a wealth or, yeah other thing.\n\n1314\n01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,900\n>> Yeah, just so many different\nthings with that policy issue.\n\n1315\n01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,570\nOkay?\n\n1316\n01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:24,535\nUsually most of the time when people do\nlog in to their particular computers.\n\n1317\n01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:26,480\nRright?\nWhether they're at home or at work.\n\n1318\n01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,210\nRight?\n\n1319\n01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,590\nThe set up at home is pretty much the key.\n\n1320\n01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:33,720\nThey need to use their workplace email,\nnot their home email.\n\n1321\n01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,260\nThat shouldn't sound, sound too difficult.\n\n1322\n01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,020\nBut it does happen when people try and\nset up and they use their home email.\n\n1323\n01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,536\nBecause they're at home and they don't\nthink about it in terms of seeing that.\n\n1324\n01:03:42,536 --> 01:03:44,291\nOkay?\nSo doing that.\n\n1325\n01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:48,590\nRemember, manually having to set it up\nbecause your computer is not a workplace\n\n1326\n01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:52,312\nparticular computer is the other\nfactor that you also have.\n\n1327\n01:03:52,312 --> 01:03:56,310\nAnd simply walking through and\naccepting those those\n\n1328\n01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:00,999\nagreements that you have to accept is,\nanother key factor for us as well.\n\n1329\n01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:02,960\nBut, the majority of this.\n\n1330\n01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,812\nIt's going to be troubleshoot, if\nanything, on the actual server side, okay?\n\n1331\n01:04:06,812 --> 01:04:09,875\nRather than on the, on the client\nside the majority of the time.\n\n1332\n01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:10,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1333\n01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:11,810\n>> Yeah.\n\n1334\n01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:12,630\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n1335\n01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:17,140\nWell, that, that does it for our, our\nwork quarters and stuff, and, you know,\n\n1336\n01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,520\nwe've, we, you know what, though?\n\n1337\n01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,070\nYeah, so it is towards the end.\n\n1338\n01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:23,010\nLet's, why don't we get back\ninto in those Windows in tune.\n\n1339\n01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:23,540\n>> Oh yeah right.\n\n1340\n01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,790\nAnd wipe some devices.\n\n1341\n01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:26,540\n>> Yeah let's see if we can wipe this guy.\n\n1342\n01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:29,080\n>> Oh we might have to actually\nreconnect on these things.\n\n1343\n01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,310\nIt might have timed out already.\n\n1344\n01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:31,940\n>> Let's see.\nOh yeah.\n\n1345\n01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,160\nThat's, that's right probably.\n\n1346\n01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,220\n>> Yeah.\nFairly [CROSSTALK]\n\n1347\n01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:36,020\n>> Oh, actually this one looks like it's,\n\n1348\n01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,000\nstill going.\n\n1349\n01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,070\n>> Should we, should we wipe Don's iPad?\n\n1350\n01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:40,065\n>> Let's wipe Don's iPad.\n\n1351\n01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:41,637\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why not?\n\n1352\n01:04:41,637 --> 01:04:42,480\n>> All right.\n\n1353\n01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,410\n>> Let's see if we can set\nthis up to wipe Don's iPad.\n\n1354\n01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,070\n>> All right let me get signed\ninto to In Tune real quick.\n\n1355\n01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,880\n>> Just wanna see if I can.\n\n1356\n01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,000\n>> This, there we go.\n\n1357\n01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,760\nAll right, as that logs in.\n\n1358\n01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,350\nI'll switch that guy over there.\n\n1359\n01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,680\nAll right this pulls up.\n\n1360\n01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,330\nPerfect, all right,\nlet's get into our groups.\n\n1361\n01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,700\nAnd our Mobile Devices.\n\n1362\n01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:10,840\nAll right.\n\n1363\n01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,400\nLooks good.\n\n1364\n01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,590\nNow I've never wiped Don's iPad before.\n\n1365\n01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,269\nSo let's see.\n>> You should pick device number one,\n\n1366\n01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:19,878\nNathan.\n\n1367\n01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:23,545\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] I, I'd be\ndevastated if that things was, was wiped.\n\n1368\n01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:24,560\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1369\n01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,390\n>> All right, so, so there it goes.\n\n1370\n01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,960\nSo now because, you know, you know,\nthese two devices are, are synced up.\n\n1371\n01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,320\n>> Yeah.\n>> We should be able to force this.\n\n1372\n01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:36,740\n>> Are you sure you want to retire the\nselected device and wipe company content?\n\n1373\n01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,245\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right?\n\n1374\n01:05:37,245 --> 01:05:37,845\nAll right.\n\n1375\n01:05:37,845 --> 01:05:39,020\nSo the selected\n\n1376\n01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:43,710\ndevice will be removed from the InTune\ninventory, all right, that works, and\n\n1377\n01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,380\nthen wipe the device before retiring.\n\n1378\n01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:50,008\nAll right, let's click on yes\n>> Mm.\n\n1379\n01:05:52,508 --> 01:05:54,395\nAll right that was exciting.\n\n1380\n01:05:54,395 --> 01:05:55,745\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was incredibly exciting.\n\n1381\n01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:57,580\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1382\n01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,240\nAnd so.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1383\n01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,171\n>> So looking at the.\n\n1384\n01:05:59,171 --> 01:05:59,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1385\n01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:02,540\nThat's a little device on,\non the iPad Mini.\n\n1386\n01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,610\nIt's just a,\nit is just kind of hanging out there.\n\n1387\n01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n1388\n01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:06,210\n>> Mm.\nThere we go.\n\n1389\n01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:08,290\nOh.\nSquare that up, a little bit there.\n\n1390\n01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:12,090\n>> [LAUGH] It's just kinda hanging out.\n\n1391\n01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,300\nPush on things, you see that.\n\n1392\n01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:16,278\nOops, that's the button there.\n\n1393\n01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:17,849\n>> Nope.\n\n1394\n01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:25,290\nPasscode requirement.\n\n1395\n01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:25,920\n>> New passcode?\n\n1396\n01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,900\nWhat was the passcode.\n\n1397\n01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,560\n>> Maybe it wiped.\n\n1398\n01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,120\nI dunno.\n>> What was the passcode for it?\n\n1399\n01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:29,710\n>> You've got me.\n\n1400\n01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,310\nI think I remember what it is.\n\n1401\n01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,520\nLet me key.\n>> I don't know what it is.\n\n1402\n01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,090\n>> I'm gonna key this in.\n\n1403\n01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,380\nI think Don told me what it was, okay.\n\n1404\n01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,210\n>> Good thing you're wiping it for him.\n\n1405\n01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:41,060\nHe's gonna appreciate that.\n\n1406\n01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:46,400\nIt's probably got his last saved,\ngame of Angry Birds on it or something.\n\n1407\n01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,500\nHm, fruit ninja,\n>> All right so, now on here.\n\n1408\n01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,680\nIt's, they're asking for\na new, a new passcode.\n\n1409\n01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,970\nSo the one that I put in there has not,\nnot accepting it so\n\n1410\n01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,030\nwe'll have to enter a new passcode.\n\n1411\n01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:03,170\nSo sure enough have wiped\nall that stuff out.\n\n1412\n01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:03,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n1413\n01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,280\n>> As our new passcode\nto set this thing up.\n\n1414\n01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:05,930\n>> There you go.\n\n1415\n01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,490\n>> So you know, pretty fast.\n\n1416\n01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,330\n>> Yep.\n>> Pretty fast,\n\n1417\n01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,470\nI was surprised I\n>> Usually with working with\n\n1418\n01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:14,295\nWindows Intune, you know in the,\nin the early days of Windows Intune.\n\n1419\n01:07:14,295 --> 01:07:16,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We, we would start, you know.\n\n1420\n01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,380\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> We would start Intunes stuff\n\n1421\n01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,450\nat the beginning and you know,\n\n1422\n01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:21,943\nby the end of the show,\n>> Sometimes things would sync,\n\n1423\n01:07:21,943 --> 01:07:23,540\nsometimes they wouldn't, but.\n\n1424\n01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,550\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Right, yes.\n\n1425\n01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,940\n>> Pretty fast, pretty fast.\n\n1426\n01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:30,680\nSo are, are we,\ngoing to put your phone in intune?\n\n1427\n01:07:30,680 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:38,301\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,980\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,140\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,230\nI am feeling sad today Don.\n\n9\n00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,660\nOh no.\nYes.\n\n10\n00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,750\nNobody noticed my appearance\non Mad Men yesterday at all.\n\n11\n00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,370\nNone.\n\n12\n00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,506\nNot a single note.\n\n13\n00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:52,078\n[LAUGH] None.\n\n14\n00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:55,720\nNot a heavy Asian\nrepresentation on Mad Men.\n\n15\n00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,830\nYeah, for some reason or another,\nnobody saw my particular\n\n16\n00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,405\nappearance on there as I try to\nmake my way into the boardroom.\n\n17\n00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:05,150\n[LAUGH] So there it is.\n\n18\n00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,440\nDid you have a full 60s outfit?\n\n19\n00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,135\nOh absolutely.\n\n20\n00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:09,850\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\nOr 50s?\n\n21\n00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,250\nWhat year is this?\n\n22\n00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,935\nOh who knows?\n\n23\n00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:12,900\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n24\n00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,820\nWell, today we've got a neat episode ahead\nof us because we're gonna be tackling\n\n25\n00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,260\nprobably one of the more frustrating\nparts of being an IT professional,\n\n26\n00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,550\nwhich is hey, Windows 8's great,\nwhen it works the way it's supposed to.\n\n27\n00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,110\nSure.\n\n28\n00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,250\nBut what do we do when things aren't\nworking the way they're supposed to?\n\n29\n00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,810\nWhen things are just breaking,\nwe're getting errors.\n\n30\n00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,680\nWhat do we do with that information\nthat most people ignore,\n\n31\n00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,310\nthat we can actually\nuse to find a problem?\n\n32\n00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,910\nYeah.\n\n33\n00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,490\nA lot of time,\nwhen we start talking about this, right?\n\n34\n00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,485\nIn the early days of operating systems,\nthere was a lot of frustration,\n\n35\n00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,900\ncuz there wasn't really a lot\nof information out there.\n\n36\n00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,460\nBut now with Microsoft again introducing\nXP and going all the way up through\n\n37\n00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,480\nWindows 8 now, time and time again\nthey've kept improving on the tools.\n\n38\n00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,150\nAnd I have to say it, in Windows 8.1\nwe've actually got a whole suite of tools\n\n39\n00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,760\nthat are available to us and\nalso, the operating system is,\n\n40\n00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,590\nI'm not gonna say it's indestructible but\nit actually does give us so\n\n41\n00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,410\nmuch more that we can actually work with\ntoday, to really be able to isolate what\n\n42\n00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,820\nthe problems are and then to actually\nhave a whole suite of tools behind us\n\n43\n00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,880\nthat we can use without having to go\nout and buy a lot of third party tools.\n\n44\n00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,467\nSo it really is an amazing\noperating system in that sense.\n\n45\n00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:22,207\nAll right, so lets start out simple,\nwith some basic troubleshooting steps and\n\n46\n00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:25,397\nprocesses and then we'll get a little\nmore advanced, as we move on,\n\n47\n00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:27,547\nand we're gonna show\nsome really cool stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:31,830\nSo, the first thing I wanna do, is I want\nto touch base on the Device Manager.\n\n49\n00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,220\nNow, this is something we covered\nin the 7687 exam and show, so\n\n50\n00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,660\nyou guys should already be familiar\nwith it, but just to kind of recap.\n\n51\n00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,770\nIf you have some hardware that is not\nfunctioning, you've got a printer,\n\n52\n00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,400\nand it's not showing up in the system.\n\n53\n00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,130\nYou've got a network adapter and\nyou're not getting an IP address,\n\n54\n00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,740\nthese kind of things.\n\n55\n00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,210\nYou've got hardware type issues.\n\n56\n00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,520\nOne of the first places that\nI go is the Device Manager.\n\n57\n00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,060\nAnd, you know, this is one\nwhere I practice what I preach,\n\n58\n00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,761\nI actually had this\nhappen just last night.\n\n59\n00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,745\n[LAUGH] So, just last night on my computer\nat home, I plugged in my headphones,\n\n60\n00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:06,140\ncuz I was about to watch a little\ntutorial, and I put on my headset and\n\n61\n00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,340\nI couldn't hear anything.\n\n62\n00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,890\nI said, what the heck's going on here?\n\n63\n00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,380\nSo I unplugged the headphone, plugged\nit back in, couldn't hear anything,\n\n64\n00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,960\nwent into my Device Manager and\nthe problem was right there.\n\n65\n00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,640\nLet me just pull up the Device Manager\nhere on my laptop, and\n\n66\n00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,510\neverything should be running fine on my\nlaptop right now, but when you go into\n\n67\n00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,250\nyour Device Manager, and there's ten\ndifferent ways to get into here,\n\n68\n00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,360\nI usually just use the start screen and\ntype device and it turns up pretty quick.\n\n69\n00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,480\nBut you can right click on this computer\nand choose manage and get in there.\n\n70\n00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,750\nWindows key x- Oh yeah?\n\n71\n00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,160\nHas the short cut to get right\ninto the Device Manager.\n\n72\n00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,600\nBut once you're in there,\nit lists all your hardware.\n\n73\n00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,050\nAnd Windows does something really neat,\nwhich is if there's any exceptions,\n\n74\n00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,690\nany bizarre statuses of your hardware,\n\n75\n00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,310\nit will automatically expand out\nthe tree item so that you can see that.\n\n76\n00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,230\nAnd there's usually three that we're\nlooking for, three bizarre statuses,\n\n77\n00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,380\nor statusi, or\nwhatever the plural of status is.\n\n78\n00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,156\nOne is one that I'm seeing right here on\nmy Cisco systems VPN adaptor, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:09,208\nYou'll notice the white circle with\na black arrow pointing down on it, right?\n\n80\n00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,401\nThat's telling me this device is disabled,\nall right?\n\n81\n00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:17,384\nThat's a warning note to me saying,\nit's not that there's a problem with this\n\n82\n00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:19,900\nhardware, it's that\nsomebody's disabled it.\n\n83\n00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,360\nOn a VPN adapter like this,\n\n84\n00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,160\nthat's a virtual network adapter,\nI expect to see this, all right?\n\n85\n00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,120\nWhen I'm not using the VPN, the Cisco\nsoftware disables that connector.\n\n86\n00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,280\nThe instant I build up a VPN,\nit'll turn this adapter on so\n\n87\n00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,580\nthis one comes and goes.\n\n88\n00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,840\nOn normal hardware you would not expect\nto see the black down arrow, right?\n\n89\n00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,990\nThat usually means that somebody manually\ndisabled that hardware, all right?\n\n90\n00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,826\nTake for example,\nI'm using a USB mouse right now, right?\n\n91\n00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:53,890\nAnd so if I go in here to mice, I can find\nmy Logitech HID-compliant unifying mouse.\n\n92\n00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,720\nThat's my mouse, right?\n\n93\n00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,308\nAnd if I disable that, okay so\nI'm just gonna disable it, and\n\n94\n00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:02,705\nI can't move my mouse anymore.\n\n95\n00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:04,968\nSo there goes the mouse, right?\n\n96\n00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:07,990\nSo you don't normally expect to see this.\n\n97\n00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,850\nIt's a manual thing.\n\n98\n00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,681\nSomebody had to do it.\n\n99\n00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:14,599\nI have a touchpad also, so I'm switching\nover to my terrible touchpad and\n\n100\n00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:17,392\nI'll turn that back on and\nmy mouse will work again.\n\n101\n00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:18,055\nThere we go.\n\n102\n00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:22,196\nSo that one's not really a random problem\nthat's gonna suddenly kick in, right?\n\n103\n00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,790\nThat's usually something\nwe've created ourselves.\n\n104\n00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,140\nWith hardware devices here,\nright, it is not disabled.\n\n105\n00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,350\nYou might also end up\nseeing a yellow triangle or\n\n106\n00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,070\na yellow question mark at times.\n\n107\n00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,360\nAnd sometimes that actually indicates for\nus, especially if you see a question mark,\n\n108\n00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,760\nis that hey look,\nI know that there is a device there,\n\n109\n00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,740\nbut Windows just can't see it.\n\n110\n00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,730\nSo you might be missing\na device driver so.\n\n111\n00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,886\nYeah, usually that's it.\n\n112\n00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:44,728\nThe device driver, right?\n\n113\n00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:48,640\nIf you plug in hardware that Windows\ndoesn't recognize, if it doesn't know that\n\n114\n00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,392\ndriver, WIndows has a ton of drivers\nbuilt in but it doesn't have all of them.\n\n115\n00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:54,626\nAnd so you'll get the yellow triangle.\n\n116\n00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:57,389\nIt's a yellow triangle with\na back exclamation point in it.\n\n117\n00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:58,272\nThat's it.\n\n118\n00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,220\nAnd that's your big warning.\n\n119\n00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,790\nI've also seen it with USB devices\nsometimes though, for whatever reason,\n\n120\n00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,430\nit doesn't recognize the device and all\nyou have to do is unplug the device and\n\n121\n00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,100\nplug it into a different USB port,\nand it recognizes it and it's happy.\n\n122\n00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,190\nSo that can happen sometimes, and\nyou don't have to load a driver.\n\n123\n00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,720\nBut more often or not,\nit just means you're missing a driver,\n\n124\n00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,090\nyou need to go out to that vendor's\nwebsite, download the driver, and load it.\n\n125\n00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,583\nNow Don, have you ever had the problem\nwhere you updated a driver and\n\n126\n00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,183\nall of a sudden the device didn't work\nthe same way that you need it to?\n\n127\n00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:27,958\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] Yeah that happens,\n\n128\n00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:28,700\nunfortunately often.\n\n129\n00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,900\nDrivers introduce change, and sometimes\nchange is good, sometimes change is bad,\n\n130\n00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,240\nand a lot of times in drivers,\nit could really cause problems.\n\n131\n00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400\nI see that with video cards mostly.\n\n132\n00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,132\nThe latest update for\na video card comes out, you apply it, and\n\n133\n00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:45,175\nall of a sudden you get overheats or\nweird reboots.\n\n134\n00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:46,960\nAnd they fix the problem soon enough, but\n\n135\n00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,880\nwhat do you do while you're waiting\non that fix to come out, right?\n\n136\n00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,208\nSo in the 7687 show,\nwe tackled how to do driver rollbacks and\n\n137\n00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,960\nhow to interact with those drivers.\n\n138\n00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,370\nSo, keep in mind that\nthat's all available and\n\n139\n00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,190\njump over to the 7687\nshow to fill in on that.\n\n140\n00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,530\nWhat we're more concerned with here\nis knowing when that's appropriate.\n\n141\n00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,860\nDriver rollbacks are tricky because\nwhen you look in your Device Manager,\n\n142\n00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,335\nyour device, it'll look normal.\n\n143\n00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:13,100\nMm-hm.\nIt won't have any exceptional\n\n144\n00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,380\nstatus on it.\n\n145\n00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,910\nAnd, let me just zoom in a bit here.\n\n146\n00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,445\nI'm gonna go double mouse on us again.\n\n147\n00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:21,090\nBut, it'll look normal like this\n\n148\n00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,830\nbecause Windows doesn't think\nthere's something wrong.\n\n149\n00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,750\nIt just has the newer driver, right.\n\n150\n00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,750\nBut we can always choose to roll it back.\n\n151\n00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,000\nI don't know if have any,\ndo I have any drivers to rollback to?\n\n152\n00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,970\nNo.\nSo, yeah,\n\n153\n00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,980\nI'm still running my original driver here.\n\n154\n00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,570\nBut if you've just done an update, you'll\nsee that little gray button there will\n\n155\n00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,451\nactually be colored so that you can\nclick on it and rollback to it.\n\n156\n00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,890\nAll right, the only other status I've\never seen in here is the red circle with\n\n157\n00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,670\nthe white x in it.\n\n158\n00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,380\n[LAUGH] Hopefully you don't see that one.\n\n159\n00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,872\nThat indicates that there is some\nkind of actual failure on the cards.\n\n160\n00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:52,093\nBecause this is hardware,\n\n161\n00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:55,284\nnormally if you have a true failure\nlike that the card just disappears.\n\n162\n00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:57,590\nIt just doesn't even show\nup in the Device Manager.\n\n163\n00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,674\nI had that happen with a network adapter\nonce, where The network adapter just died.\n\n164\n00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,525\nYeah.\nThe circuitry on it had a popped\n\n165\n00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,270\ncapacitor.\n\n166\n00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,200\nLooking at the card,\nyou could see that popped- Yeah.\n\n167\n00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,410\nCapacitor right on it, but\ninside the computer you couldn't.\n\n168\n00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,750\nIt just made the card not\nreceive enough power.\n\n169\n00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,696\nIt didn't even show up\nin the Device Manager.\n\n170\n00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:14,450\nRight.\n\n171\n00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,230\nSo that's what you'll normally see there.\n\n172\n00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,010\nYeah, the good thing is, this is one place\nthat we can actually really use to help us\n\n173\n00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,310\nto pinpoint what particular hardware\nissue We're really taking a look at here.\n\n174\n00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,410\nAnd this should be actually kind\nof near the top of our list when\n\n175\n00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,650\nwe begin the idea of troubleshooting,\nespecially with hardware.\n\n176\n00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,631\nNow, unfortunately with hardware issues,\nuser applications our regular\n\n177\n00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:39,537\nuser space stuff is not allowed\nto touch hardware, right?\n\n178\n00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,280\nRight.\nWe have to go through the hardware\n\n179\n00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,400\nabstraction layer,\nwhich is part of the Windows core OS.\n\n180\n00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,770\nAnd the HAL or hardware abstraction layer,\nthat's what's allowed to reach out and\n\n181\n00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,830\ntouch the hardware.\n\n182\n00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,730\nSo if something goes\nwrong with the hardware,\n\n183\n00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,940\nit's happening not in user space- Right.\n\n184\n00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,460\nBut in kernel space.\n\n185\n00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,445\nAnd that means a failure in kernel\nspace is gonna be far worse than,\n\n186\n00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:01,742\nlike if- Right.\n\n187\n00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:02,750\nGoogle Chrome- Yeah.\n\n188\n00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,910\nCrashes for me,\nI don't have to reboot my computer.\n\n189\n00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,075\nBut if we have a hardware failure kernel\nspace you're normally gonna have to\n\n190\n00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:10,762\nreboot, they're critical problems.\n\n191\n00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:11,370\nRight.\n\n192\n00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,432\nAnd that's where we start to get\nwhat are called stop errors.\n\n193\n00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,443\nRight.\nSo let's talk about stop errors for\n\n194\n00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:16,962\na minute.\n\n195\n00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:18,390\nYeah.\nNow stop errors.\n\n196\n00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,987\nA lot of us know them by their old name.\n\n197\n00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:23,415\n[LAUGH] The BSOD or blue screen of death.\n\n198\n00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:26,170\nIn the olden days- Right.\n\n199\n00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,050\nWhen Windows had a kernel space\nfailure that the base just\n\n200\n00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,960\nfreaked out the whole operating system.\n\n201\n00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,452\nYour screen would turn blue, and\nthen in either white or gray text,\n\n202\n00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,690\ndepending on the OS- Yeah.\n\n203\n00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,030\nYou would then get a memory dump.\n\n204\n00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,060\nRight.\nIt would tell you the module that failed,\n\n205\n00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,610\nwhich might be meaningful, it might not.\n\n206\n00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,560\nAnd then just a huge list of hexadecimal\ncharacters spread across the screen\n\n207\n00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,560\nthat were identifying what was in\nRAM at the point when it crashed.\n\n208\n00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,810\nRight?\n\n209\n00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,760\nTo end users, what does that information?\n\n210\n00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,120\nWhat does that information mean to you,\nRonnie?\n\n211\n00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,490\nIt meant nothing to me except for\n\n212\n00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,210\na bunch of hexadecimal numbers that\nI had no clue what they were about.\n\n213\n00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,370\nYep.\nYeah.\n\n214\n00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,020\nAnd Microsoft isn't the only company\nthat does this, other OS's do it too.\n\n215\n00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,560\nSome of them got a little\nsmarter early one, like Apple.\n\n216\n00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,332\nApple said look, our end-users they don't\nneed a memory dump- [LAUGH] That doesn't\n\n217\n00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:12,960\nmean anything to them.\n\n218\n00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,832\nSo what do they get?\n\n219\n00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:14,948\nThey get the sad mac, right?\n\n220\n00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,615\n[LAUGH] The little mac appears on\nthe screen, it's got a frowney face.\n\n221\n00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:18,826\nYeah.\nAnd x's for it's eyes, and\n\n222\n00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,330\nthen the computer reboots.\n\n223\n00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,266\nWhy bother showing them the memory dump?\n\n224\n00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:22,250\nRight.\n\n225\n00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,250\nAnd Microsoft has finally\ngone that way too.\n\n226\n00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,450\nThey said do you know what?\n\n227\n00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,070\nThere is no point in showing\nthe memory dump to our end user.\n\n228\n00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,240\nSo instead we're gonna show a blue screen.\n\n229\n00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,070\nYeah.\nIt is still blue.\n\n230\n00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,477\nIt's a different blue now- Right.\n\n231\n00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:33,400\nBut it is still blue.\n\n232\n00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,390\nAnd it's got a little frowny face on it.\n\n233\n00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,370\nYeah, it's the sideways frowny face, so\nwhen you do the emoticon kinda thing.\n\n234\n00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,850\nLet me see if I can\nfind a picture of this.\n\n235\n00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,280\nYeah, it's kind of unusual, right?\n\n236\n00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,490\nBut because Microsoft has been heading\nmore towards that unified kind of device,\n\n237\n00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,690\nbetween tablets and phones and\nPCs and laptops and\n\n238\n00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,620\nstuff here, what you actually get is?\n\n239\n00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,050\nOh yeah, Don's actually pulling\nup a picture of it right here.\n\n240\n00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,870\nAnd you see that there's different\nones that you can see here.\n\n241\n00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,150\nSo here again,\nif you're texting and you- Yeah.\n\n242\n00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,260\nGot that and there it is,\nthe sideways sad frowny face.\n\n243\n00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,175\nThere you go.\n\n244\n00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:12,614\nYup, and so this screen is designed\nto invoke peaceful feelings.\n\n245\n00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:13,267\nThat's right.\n\n246\n00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:13,920\nYou're right.\n\n247\n00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,630\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n248\n00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,794\nAnd it does give you\na little bit of information.\n\n249\n00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:18,410\nYeah.\nYou'll see right here it says,\n\n250\n00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,943\nif you'd like to know more,\nsearch online for this error.\n\n251\n00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:22,190\nYeah.\nAnd here's the error they got.\n\n252\n00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,980\nAlways look on the bright side of life.\n\n253\n00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,860\nThey probably wrote\na function to cause this,\n\n254\n00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,483\ncuz that doesn't sound\nlike a common error to me.\n\n255\n00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:32,259\n[LAUGH] And it'll normally\nsay something like IRQ- Yeah.\n\n256\n00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,720\nNon-equal or less.\n\n257\n00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,530\nSomething like that,\nindicating a hardware failure.\n\n258\n00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,330\nIt doesn't give you a ton of information.\n\n259\n00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,810\nBut that doesn't mean\nit isn't gathering it.\n\n260\n00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,650\nWhat it's doing is in the background,\nit's actually recording- Right.\n\n261\n00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,635\nA memory dump.\n\n262\n00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:49,695\nIt's writing to the hard drive stuff\nthat was in RAM at the time of failure.\n\n263\n00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:54,475\nAnd that way when you reboot, if you're\none of those people that can actually deal\n\n264\n00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:57,175\nwith this data,\nyou can use that file to recover.\n\n265\n00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,890\nAll right, now I was a big OS/2- Right.\n\n266\n00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,756\nUser back in the day.\n\n267\n00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:03,400\nIBM OS/2- [LAUGH] I love\nthat operating system.\n\n268\n00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200\nAnd it's all but dead now.\n\n269\n00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,480\nAnd I remember, gosh this would've been\n1995- [LAUGH] Probably, maybe 1996.\n\n270\n00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,790\nI was running OS/2 Warp, and my sound\ncard caused a segment fault of some sort.\n\n271\n00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,784\nAnd I got one of those memory\ndumps on the screen- Right.\n\n272\n00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,350\nAnd it gave me all the hexadecimal.\n\n273\n00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,343\nAnd I called IBM support, cuz I was- Yup.\n\n274\n00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,020\nUnder support with them.\n\n275\n00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,220\nAnd that the operator\non the other hand said,\n\n276\n00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,230\nokay I need you to read\nout the memory dump to me.\n\n277\n00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,273\n[LAUGH] And I sat there on the phone and\n\n278\n00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:35,144\nread out every little\nnumerical value to this guy.\n\n279\n00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:36,309\nSo that he could- Right.\n\n280\n00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:39,750\nPunch it into their system and\nfind out where the fault was.\n\n281\n00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,470\nWell, that was a horrible.\n\n282\n00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,750\nI mean,\nI was on the phone with that guy for\n\n283\n00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,780\nwell over an hour just reading\noff that stuff, it was terrible.\n\n284\n00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,450\nWell, in Windows we don't\nhave to deal with that.\n\n285\n00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,790\nThe memory is actually being\ndumped to your hard drive.\n\n286\n00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,400\nAnd so when we reboot,\nwe'll get to see this a little bit later.\n\n287\n00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,290\nWe actually have software tools that we\ncan use to open up that dump file, and\n\n288\n00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,580\ndo analysis on it and\nfind out all sorts of good data,\n\n289\n00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,020\nwithout having to record a bunch of\nhexadecimal values from our screen.\n\n290\n00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,520\nYeah.\n\n291\n00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,950\nAll right, so these types of things,\n\n292\n00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,650\nthey're called stop errors because\nbasically your whole system stops.\n\n293\n00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,810\nYou've had a crash,\nthe computer cannot recover from it.\n\n294\n00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,135\nAnd you're gonna have to reboot.\n\n295\n00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:17,170\nYeah.\n\n296\n00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,230\nNow, if you're a regular user, there's\nnot all that much you can do to recover\n\n297\n00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,705\nfrom stop errors like these, right?\n\n298\n00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:25,112\nRight.\nYour system is dead in the water and\n\n299\n00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:26,551\nthat's it.\n\n300\n00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:27,238\nYeah.\n\n301\n00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:30,160\nNow, there are some light\nthings we can do, and\n\n302\n00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,080\nwe'll get into the detail\nthings a little bit later.\n\n303\n00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,510\nBut on the higher level we can use\ntools like the reliability monitor,\n\n304\n00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,780\nthis guy here.\n\n305\n00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,730\nAnd it can help us to establish whether or\nnot there's a pattern to these crashes.\n\n306\n00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,810\nAre they always recurring on\nthe same day at the same time.\n\n307\n00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,480\nYeah.\nOr am I running the same application when\n\n308\n00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,550\nit happens.\n\n309\n00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,800\nFiguring out the pattern is\nnormally a lot more useful to\n\n310\n00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,750\nfinding the cause than it is\nanalyzing some memory BAM.\n\n311\n00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,240\nYeah, the Reliability Monitor for\nus has been around for a little while.\n\n312\n00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,970\nIt actually first made its appearance like\nin Vista, and then through Windows 7.\n\n313\n00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,480\nBut now Windows 8 it also continues\nto make its appearance again.\n\n314\n00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,310\nAnd it really does track whether\nmaybe a hardware failure,\n\n315\n00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,300\na particular software application failure\nor whether it's Windows failures as well.\n\n316\n00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,110\nAnd it does it again tracking over time.\n\n317\n00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,460\nAnd it gives us a nice little\nchart in what we have here.\n\n318\n00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,780\nAnd so Don has brought up one for\nyour computer.\n\n319\n00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,490\nThis is my laptop- Yup.\n\n320\n00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,070\nAnd actually,\nit looks like I've been doing okay lately.\n\n321\n00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,650\nYeah.\n\n322\n00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,770\nThe reliability monitor this is it, and\n\n323\n00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,210\nyou can get at it through\nyour control panel.\n\n324\n00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,633\nAgain, I just use the start screen- Yeah.\n\n325\n00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:34,380\nAnd type reliability.\n\n326\n00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,770\nIt's the only thing that turns up.\n\n327\n00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,390\nBut it's inside of the control panel,\nin System and\n\n328\n00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,770\nSecurity inside the actions center,\nand then the reliability monitor.\n\n329\n00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,700\nRight.\nSo that's how you drill down to find this.\n\n330\n00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,513\nAnd what it does?\n\n331\n00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:51,121\nIs it keeps track of what your system has\nbeen doing, and how it's been running?\n\n332\n00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:55,799\nAnd it gives you a,\nthey call it the Reliability Index.\n\n333\n00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,451\nRight.\n\n334\n00:14:56,451 --> 00:15:00,840\nAnd they basically rank your computer on a\nscale of one to ten by how reliable it is.\n\n335\n00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,310\nTen is perfectly reliable,\nyou are a stable system.\n\n336\n00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,430\nOne means you are segfaulting-\n[LAUGH] All over the place and\n\n337\n00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,000\nyou can barely keep your computer online,\nall right?\n\n338\n00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,520\nAnd the last time I pulled\nthis up in a show- [LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,420\nI had been crashing a driver repeatedly\nand so my numbers were terrible.\n\n340\n00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,620\nOh Ronnie, yours are terrible.\n\n341\n00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,545\nYeah.\nJeez, let's pull up your laptop.\n\n342\n00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:19,402\nLet's do that.\nHoly moly.\n\n343\n00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,650\nWhat are you doing over there?\n\n344\n00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,190\nOneDrive.\n\n345\n00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,736\nSo it's all.\n\n346\n00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:24,417\n[LAUGH] There you go.\n\n347\n00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:27,620\nAll right, so notice that ten would\nbe all the way up at the top.\n\n348\n00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,054\nIt doesn't look like Ronnie has ever hit\na ten- [LAUGH] Where as mine was kinda\n\n349\n00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:33,300\ncruising at ten this whole time.\n\n350\n00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,423\nBut you'll see- Yeah.\n\n351\n00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,277\nRonnie, you were averaging like a five.\n\n352\n00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:37,100\n[LAUGH] Yeah, I know.\n\n353\n00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,120\nSo the cool thing about\nthe Reliability Monitor\n\n354\n00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,520\nis it keeps track of when\nyou install software?\n\n355\n00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,400\nWhen you install drivers?\n\n356\n00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,161\nWhen you have errors in the event log?\n\n357\n00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,866\nAnd it keeps track of what\nday in time they occurred on?\n\n358\n00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:56,511\nSo Ronnie can pick a day like\nthat was a bad day- Yeah.\n\n359\n00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:57,716\nFor you, Ronnie.\nRight.\n\n360\n00:15:57,716 --> 00:15:59,908\nApril 12th, that was a week ago.\n\n361\n00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,021\nSo, a week ago,\nRonnie had a really bad day.\n\n362\n00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,651\nYes.\nAnd if he clicks on it like he's done,\n\n363\n00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:09,434\ndown at the bottom it shows what happens\nand it looks like Oracle VirtualBox was\n\n364\n00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:12,150\njust dying [LAUGH] Left and\nright Left and right.\n\n365\n00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,370\nYeah, every ten minutes or so.\n\n366\n00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,330\nWhat were you doing?\n\n367\n00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,990\nI don't know [LAUGH].\n\n368\n00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,950\nWhatever it was, it was bad.\n\n369\n00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,930\nIt was terrible that day.\n\n370\n00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,860\nYou also have an Internet Explorer\ncrash in there.\n\n371\n00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,490\nAnd so its got these, and if I remember\nright Ronnie can double-click on those?\n\n372\n00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,614\nYep.\nDoesn't it open the?\n\n373\n00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:30,390\nThere's a, let's see if it does,\nyep there it goes.\n\n374\n00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:30,910\nYeah.\nSo\n\n375\n00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,470\nif you double-click on it you get detailed\ninformation about what that error was and\n\n376\n00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,450\nwhat was going on when it happened.\n\n377\n00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,390\nSo here we see the APPCRASH,\nthis is for Internet Explorer.\n\n378\n00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,370\nAnd it gives us information about\nwhat library was being called, and\n\n379\n00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,390\nyou'll see what time it was,\nwhat version of Internet Explorer.\n\n380\n00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,960\nSome of the basic information we can\nuse to try and figure out our issue or\n\n381\n00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,230\nour problem.\n\n382\n00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,919\nThis one, not terribly helpful,\nieframe.dll.\n\n383\n00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,650\n[LAUGH] I had some kinda webpage crash.\n\n384\n00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,800\nUsually an extension or\nsomething like that's involved.\n\n385\n00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,070\nIf you scroll down a little bit,\n\n386\n00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,200\nyou'll see where it tells about\nsome of the memory dumps it made.\n\n387\n00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,190\nSo files that help describe the problem.\n\n388\n00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,010\nIf we go and\nlook at some of these dump files,\n\n389\n00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,810\nwe can find out that\nadditional information.\n\n390\n00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,330\nAll right.\n\n391\n00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,543\nThe other thing you can use,\nthough, when you're looking\n\n392\n00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:21,169\nat this overall kinda calendar view\nis you can get an idea- Sorry.\n\n393\n00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,947\nYou can get an idea of the pattern,\nthe timing,\n\n394\n00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:28,460\nis there a recurring issue that's\nhappening over and over and over again?\n\n395\n00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,430\nSo like we jump back to Ronnie's that\nhe has some bad stuff happening,\n\n396\n00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,600\nbut it's not really fitting a pattern.\n\n397\n00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,750\nAnd so if you look at it,\nlike there is SkyDrive crashing.\n\n398\n00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,070\nSkyDrive.\nAnd you'll see more SkyDrive.\n\n399\n00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,450\nYou do have a bad history with.\n\n400\n00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,040\nI do.\nI mean, OneDrive,\n\n401\n00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,360\nwhatever everyone's calling it these days.\n\n402\n00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,720\nSo it really helps to\nkinda dial in on that.\n\n403\n00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,600\nAgain, you don't need to be a programmer\nor a developer, you don't need to be\n\n404\n00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,150\nan electrical engineer to just be able to\nlook and sense patterns and find problems.\n\n405\n00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,440\nWhat you hope to see is,\nnotice the bottom part of Ronnie's screen.\n\n406\n00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,640\nHe's got a failure, OneDrive Sync\nEngine Host has stop working, and\n\n407\n00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080\nthen beneath that there was a definition\nupdate for Windows Defender.\n\n408\n00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,740\nOkay, could it be that the definition\nupdate led to the crash?\n\n409\n00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,680\nNo, not in this case because,\nlook at the time.\n\n410\n00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,680\nThe definition update\nhappened after the crash.\n\n411\n00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,310\nBut if you see a driver update\nimmediately followed by a crash,\n\n412\n00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,170\nthen maybe the driver update\nis what caused our problem.\n\n413\n00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,900\nAnd we can roll back that driver and\ntry and fix it, right?\n\n414\n00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,850\nRight.\nSo it's a very useful tool.\n\n415\n00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,990\nI like the visual representation\nthat it gives us down here\n\n416\n00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,750\non the bottom half of this timeline.\n\n417\n00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,900\nWhere it tells you whether it's actually\napplication related, or Window related, or\n\n418\n00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,630\nagain, just the idea of\nwarnings that come about.\n\n419\n00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,360\nAgain, a good idea, once again,\nwhen we track those patterns and\n\n420\n00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,770\nthen maybe we could pinpoint, hey there's\nsomething that we need to do here.\n\n421\n00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,480\nNow, I've been dealing with this\nOneDrive thing, because where I live,\n\n422\n00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,530\nwith the satellite connection,\nit's always constantly trying to update.\n\n423\n00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,814\nSo I've tried to disable it and so\n\n424\n00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:03,880\nit's been popping up every time I come\nback on our business network here.\n\n425\n00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,020\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so it's probably not happy.\n\n426\n00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,090\nAll right, so when it comes to\ntroubleshooting hardware on our system,\n\n427\n00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,240\nthe device manager is a great\nplace to go to get information.\n\n428\n00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,860\nThe reliability monitor,\nanother great place to go.\n\n429\n00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,180\nThere is one particular type of hardware,\nthough,\n\n430\n00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,410\nthat won't be represented\nwell on those screens.\n\n431\n00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,210\nAnd that's printers.\n\n432\n00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,841\nPrinters, for the most part,\n\n433\n00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:28,247\nthey really don't register their\nerrors with device manager.\n\n434\n00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:31,780\nThey don't register their errors\nwith the reliability monitor.\n\n435\n00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,190\nBut instead, they register their\nerrors with the print queues.\n\n436\n00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,120\nAnd so we can find information\nabout them in the event logs.\n\n437\n00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,390\nBut normally,\nwhen I'm troubleshooting a printer,\n\n438\n00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,300\nit's the print queues that I go to,\nright off the bat.\n\n439\n00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,650\nSo let me show you an example of that.\n\n440\n00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,680\nI'm going to bring up,\non my machine, here.\n\n441\n00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,610\nLet me just get into my Devices and\nPrinters.\n\n442\n00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,990\nAnd we'll see a list of the various\nprinters that I've got available.\n\n443\n00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,410\nAnd let's take,\nwe'll take this guy here, I don't know,\n\n444\n00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,130\nI guess I could really do any of these.\n\n445\n00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,620\nThis is a big office printer that\nwe have here in the building.\n\n446\n00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,050\nAnd let's say that I'm\nsending print jobs to it, and\n\n447\n00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,156\nthey're just not coming\nout on the other end.\n\n448\n00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:10,065\nAll right.\n\n449\n00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:12,905\nWell, one of the easiest ways to\nfind out what's going on is to view\n\n450\n00:20:12,905 --> 00:20:13,625\nour print queue.\n\n451\n00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,900\nNow, printers have more than\none way of looking at them.\n\n452\n00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,995\nIf we right-click, let me zoom in on this,\nif we right-click on that menu,\n\n453\n00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:21,905\nyou'll see a few things.\n\n454\n00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:25,670\nAnd it gets really confusing because\nwe've got Printing preferences,\n\n455\n00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,110\nPrinter properties and\nregular Properties, which one do we go to?\n\n456\n00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,060\nAnd then we got the Troubleshooter, which\nI'm not a big fan of, but it is there.\n\n457\n00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,500\nSo which one do we go to?\n\n458\n00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,730\nWell each one gives us\ndifferent bits of information.\n\n459\n00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,150\nSo for example, if I just choose that\nbottom one that says, Properties.\n\n460\n00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:47,190\nWhat I'm going to see here is really\ninformation about the hardware, but\n\n461\n00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,910\nnot much that I can change.\n\n462\n00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,630\nRight?\n\n463\n00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,280\nThis is a Canon imageRUNNER printer,\nI can see that, great, now we know.\n\n464\n00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,590\nAnd if I go over to hardware, I can see\nthat I've got that printer defined.\n\n465\n00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,150\nIt is a printer queue,\nwe queue up jobs to send to it.\n\n466\n00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,000\nAnd that's really about it, right?\n\n467\n00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,450\nIf I go into my Properties here.\n\n468\n00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,030\nThis is where I can drive in and start to\ndeal with some of the other settings, and\n\n469\n00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,020\neven the driver to an extent.\n\n470\n00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,320\nBut you're just not seeing a whole lot\nin here to be able to work with, right?\n\n471\n00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,590\nWhere we really want to go is if we\nright-click on this one and go to Printer\n\n472\n00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,420\nproperties, that's the screen where we\nreally get the ability to change things.\n\n473\n00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,140\nLet me zoom out,\nthis one doesn't quite fit on the screen.\n\n474\n00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,100\nBut in here, we can start to mess\nwith our preferences if we need to.\n\n475\n00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,050\nBut you'll also see under Advanced, here's\nwhere we can manipulate that driver.\n\n476\n00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,230\nYou might have more than one driver for\nthe same printer,\n\n477\n00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,310\ndepending on if you've done updates or\nwhatever.\n\n478\n00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,390\nYou can load new drivers here,\n\n479\n00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,555\nthis is where we can kinda work\nwith those driver type issues.\n\n480\n00:21:52,555 --> 00:21:55,680\nAll right, other things though,\nI've mentioned the print queue.\n\n481\n00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,030\nIf you just double-click on one of these,\nit'll take you in here and\n\n482\n00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,750\nwhat we're looking at is, basically,\nthe printer as Windows sees it.\n\n483\n00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,370\nAnd they've changed it in Windows 8 so\nit shows some other stuff like here,\n\n484\n00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,030\nthe support and service, to be able\nto reach out to Canon in this case.\n\n485\n00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,580\nBut what I always like to see is this\nwhere it says zero documents in queue.\n\n486\n00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,040\nIf I click on that,\nthat's gonna bring up the printer queue.\n\n487\n00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,400\nNow, the printer queue has\na couple very simple traits.\n\n488\n00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,380\nOne of the most important ones\nis the status bar right here,\n\n489\n00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,360\nmy status bar is blank.\n\n490\n00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,190\nIf I was sending a print job to this\nprinter, it wouldn't be blank down there.\n\n491\n00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,920\nIt would actually say processing,\nor printing, or whatever.\n\n492\n00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,140\nIf my print job gets stuck,\nit would say error right there and\n\n493\n00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,650\nexplain why,\nit would tell me why I'm getting an error.\n\n494\n00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,140\nAll right.\n\n495\n00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,780\nYou can also see a print status of paused.\n\n496\n00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,255\nIf another administrator somewhere\nout there has paused the printer.\n\n497\n00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,880\nNow, why would we pause the printer?\n\n498\n00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,510\nWell, maybe there's a paper jam.\n\n499\n00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,500\nAnd so we don't want people to try and\nprint to the printer.\n\n500\n00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,410\nSo as an administrator, I might choose\nto go to Printer > Pause Printing.\n\n501\n00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,630\nAnd that way other people can send\nprint jobs to the printer and\n\n502\n00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,150\nit will just hold onto them.\n\n503\n00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,710\nI can fix the print jam, and\nthen once the printer is ready to go,\n\n504\n00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,400\nI can unpause the printer and it will\nstart printing again all on its own.\n\n505\n00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,972\nOkay.\n\n506\n00:23:16,972 --> 00:23:19,430\nSo sorta a great way to go about that.\n\n507\n00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,140\nAll right?\n\n508\n00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,080\nBut let's say there's an error.\n\n509\n00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,791\nLet me show you guys an error.\n\n510\n00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:23,336\nWhoops.\n\n511\n00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:26,174\nLet me draw on my screen apparently.\n\n512\n00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:31,940\nI'm going to take the printer and\nhow can I make this one error?\n\n513\n00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,020\nYou know what, I'll change the port.\n\n514\n00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,930\nSo right now that\nprinter's at a certain IP.\n\n515\n00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,038\nI'm going to add just an incorrect IP.\n\n516\n00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:53,128\nAll right, so I'm gonna add an IP\naddress that I know is wrong,\n\n517\n00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:54,608\nthat there's no printer on there.\n\n518\n00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:57,778\nAnd I'll tie it to that So when I send\na print job, what's going to happen?\n\n519\n00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:00,376\nIt's gonna try and\nsend it to that IP that's incorrect and\n\n520\n00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:03,330\nit's not gonna be able\nto contact that printer.\n\n521\n00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,610\nThe job is gonna error out and when it\nerrors out, it'll give me some basic\n\n522\n00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,480\ninformation about why it errored out and\nwe can kinda troubleshoot it from there.\n\n523\n00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,120\nIn this case, it'll just be the IP that's\nwrong but it could be other things.\n\n524\n00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,060\nThe printer could be turned off.\n\n525\n00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,060\nI could not have a network connection,\ncan I even ping the printer?\n\n526\n00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,910\nThat's always a good test,\njust to see whether that's possible.\n\n527\n00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,150\nSo these are all things that we can do\nas part of that troubleshooting process\n\n528\n00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,150\nfor printers.\n\n529\n00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,360\nYou know it's amazing, I'm glad that\nyou mentioned that cuz sometimes,\n\n530\n00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,380\nit's very easy to think\nthat everything is,\n\n531\n00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,081\nyou assume it's okay just\nbecause you set it up.\n\n532\n00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:41,842\n[LAUGH] But remember sometimes you\nactually just have to go ahead and check,\n\n533\n00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:44,179\nverify that somebody\ndidn't move the printer,\n\n534\n00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:47,828\ntrying to reach a piece of paper in\nthe back of it, disconnecting the power or\n\n535\n00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:50,060\neven the network cable\na lot of times here.\n\n536\n00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,830\nHaving to go back and\njust do the simple troubleshooting things\n\n537\n00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,400\nare always good when you're\nactually remembering this.\n\n538\n00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,830\nSo it really does help\nin that instance here.\n\n539\n00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,940\nAll right, so I'm just gonna lie\nto it about the card a little bit.\n\n540\n00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,540\nOf course.\nYeah.\n\n541\n00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,910\nI like to lie to my computer when I can.\n\n542\n00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,260\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n543\n00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,110\nI'm gonna punch it over to this\nnew port that I know is wrong.\n\n544\n00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,702\nThere we go and here,\nI'll just print this.\n\n545\n00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:22,703\nYou know another thing worth\nmentioning is sometimes you'll send\n\n546\n00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:25,295\na document to a printer or whatever.\n\n547\n00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:25,850\nMm-hm.\n\n548\n00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,020\nAnd if you've got a corrupted driver.\n\n549\n00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,730\nYeah.\nOr\n\n550\n00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,150\nthe printer somehow garbles\nthe communications or whatever,\n\n551\n00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:37,110\nyou can end up with a print job\nthat is stuck in the printer, okay?\n\n552\n00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,940\nIt'll have an error status sitting\non it and it's just stuck and\n\n553\n00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,080\nyou can't get rid of it.\n\n554\n00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,540\nAnd by get rid of it I mean if you have a\nprint job lock up, you can normally right\n\n555\n00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,240\nclick on it and choose Cancel and\nthe print job will go away.\n\n556\n00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,280\nBut if it gets stuck, if it says error and\nhitting cancel doesn't remove it,\n\n557\n00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,315\nit's just stuck there, every other print\njob is just gonna build up behind it and\n\n558\n00:25:58,315 --> 00:25:59,822\nyou've effectively blocked your printer.\n\n559\n00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,320\nWhen that happens,\n\n560\n00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,350\na corrupted print job is very difficult to\nclear out just through our regular GUI.\n\n561\n00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,620\nAll the print jobs are being managed by\na service called the print spooler and\n\n562\n00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,430\nthe print spooler holds all those\nprint jobs open and so if you try and\n\n563\n00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,330\ncancel it or manually delete it, you can't\nbecause they're being manually held open.\n\n564\n00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,460\nSo if you ever have a print\njob that gets stuck,\n\n565\n00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,400\none of the easiest solutions is to simply\nrestart your print spooler, all right?\n\n566\n00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,530\nAnd while I wait on this one to error\nout because it's doing its retries,\n\n567\n00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,150\nlet me show you, I'm just gonna\nbring up my services screen and\n\n568\n00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,760\nI'll hunt down the print spooler.\n\n569\n00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,310\nYep, there's my error.\n\n570\n00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,368\nHere's the print spooler right here, and I\ncould right click on the print spooler and\n\n571\n00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:46,920\nchoose Restart Service.\n\n572\n00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,870\nWhen it restarts,\nany corrupted print jobs will get deleted\n\n573\n00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,020\nout cuz when the service stops,\nthat releases the hold on those files and\n\n574\n00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,400\nthen when it starts back up it tries to\nread the files, sees the corruption and\n\n575\n00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,800\njust deletes them, all right?\n\n576\n00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,770\nSo a very, very simple way.\n\n577\n00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,450\nYeah.\nIn fact, back in NT4 days, I got my NCSC,\n\n578\n00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,320\nDid it all the time, yeah.\n\n579\n00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,580\nOriginally under NT4 and\nthis was in the book.\n\n580\n00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,235\nYeah.\nIt was like hey,\n\n581\n00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,440\nrestart your print spooler.\n\n582\n00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,850\nYeah.\nNow they don't mention it so much but\n\n583\n00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,955\nit's still very, very valid.\n\n584\n00:27:11,955 --> 00:27:12,801\nMm-hm.\nAll right,\n\n585\n00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:17,340\nlet's go take a look\nat my error All right.\n\n586\n00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,250\nSo here's my print job and\nI do have an error now.\n\n587\n00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,470\nSee how it says Error-Printing and\n\n588\n00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,000\nI've got one document in\nqueue in my note there.\n\n589\n00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,170\nSo, I know there's been an error,\nall right?\n\n590\n00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,790\nBut it's not really giving me\na ton of information, is it?\n\n591\n00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,660\nAside from the fact that there is\nan error, if I pull up the properties,\n\n592\n00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,870\nyou really just get basic information\nabout the print job itself and so it's not\n\n593\n00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,745\nreally giving me a ton of data as to why\nthat error happened in the first place.\n\n594\n00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:48,450\nMm-hm.\nSo\n\n595\n00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,670\nI'm somewhat limited in my choices here.\n\n596\n00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,510\nI can try and restart the print job.\n\n597\n00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,630\nRight click on it, choose Restart,\nsee what happens but\n\n598\n00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:01,280\nif that doesn't work, I need to see if I\ncan actually communicate with the printer.\n\n599\n00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,130\nIf you can't, a lot of times,\nin the devices and printers screen,\n\n600\n00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,440\nwhich I guess I closed.\n\n601\n00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,598\nThought I still had that open somewhere.\n\n602\n00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:09,696\n[LAUGH] Guess not.\n\n603\n00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:15,457\nIn the devices and printer screen,\nif you can't communicate with the printer,\n\n604\n00:28:15,457 --> 00:28:18,860\na lot of times it will be grayed out but\nyou will see mine is not grayed out.\n\n605\n00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,890\nBut if I float over it, I do see a status\nerror right there, letting me know\n\n606\n00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,980\nthere is some kind of problem with\nthe printer and I can see that error here.\n\n607\n00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,140\nI just double-clicked on the printer and\nif I click on error,\n\n608\n00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,900\nit just takes you in here.\n\n609\n00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,460\nSo you're not really seeing\na ton of details but\n\n610\n00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,790\nyou can try and ping the printer,\nsee if you can get there.\n\n611\n00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,760\nRun a test page, right?\n\n612\n00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,940\nTest pages are pretty easy to send.\n\n613\n00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,690\nLet's see if I can remember where that is.\n\n614\n00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,960\nIf we go back into our,\nI just closed that screen again.\n\n615\n00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,330\nSee how many times I can do that.\n\n616\n00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,430\nWe right click on the printer and\ngo to Printer Properties.\n\n617\n00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,680\nThey'd be down there at\nthe bottom of the page.\n\n618\n00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,120\nYeah, it's right there at the bottom,\nPrint Test Page.\n\n619\n00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,700\nSo we can hit that, and\nit will send a standard Windows test page.\n\n620\n00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,130\nThat'll take your software out of\nthe equation, and let you see whether or\n\n621\n00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,685\nnot it's a driver or\nhardware issue from there.\n\n622\n00:29:07,685 --> 00:29:09,910\nSo there's some good tools here.\n\n623\n00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,870\nNot the most detailed of information but\nthe thing about the printers is, today,\n\n624\n00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,110\na lot of them are networked printers.\n\n625\n00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,010\nThey're not directly\nattached to your machine and\n\n626\n00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,600\nthat's why we don't get error reporting\nin the device manager, for example.\n\n627\n00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,170\nNow, this brings us up to that one\ntopic we were kind of like what do\n\n628\n00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,160\nwe really want to do this,\nwhich is that NFC to print idea.\n\n629\n00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,690\nNear field communication\nis really this idea for\n\n630\n00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,760\nus that we can have the devices\nthat are wireless, and\n\n631\n00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,980\nthen simply take the device over to an NFC\naware printer, or one that is enabled for\n\n632\n00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,510\nus and tap it, and that'll actually cause\nthe print job to actually begin printing.\n\n633\n00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,660\nPretty neat.\n\n634\n00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,250\nAnd this is really designed for\nmobile devices, cell phones, iPads,\n\n635\n00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,730\nwhatever, you don't really see\nit in laptops but Microsoft,\n\n636\n00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,330\nthey're starting to blend the line\nbetween the Windows phones devices and\n\n637\n00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:02,230\nthe surface tablets and stuff and\nso, if you have NFC in your laptop,\n\n638\n00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,430\nwhich we've got fairly new laptops\nhere and none of ours have it.\n\n639\n00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,660\nSo if you have NFC in your laptop and\n\n640\n00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,730\nyou have an NFC enabled printer,\nyou can do Tap To Print.\n\n641\n00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,640\nBasically, you'll have a Tap To Print\napplication, which if you have an HP\n\n642\n00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,250\nprinter, you normally install the HP\napplication on your laptop or device.\n\n643\n00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,950\nMy cell phone has it and I've got\nthe HP application on my cell phone.\n\n644\n00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,320\nSo I can walk up to an HP printer, and I\ncan fire up that application on my phone,\n\n645\n00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,690\nand hit the Tap To Print and\nI touch my phone to the printer.\n\n646\n00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,590\nThe NFC tag in the device, it\nestablishes contact at about six inches,\n\n647\n00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,740\nyou really need to get close but\nit'll tap it and\n\n648\n00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,740\nbasically what it does is it\nexchanges an authentication key.\n\n649\n00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,810\nThen the devices are allowed to\ntalk over the wireless network\n\n650\n00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,650\nto be able to send that print job in.\n\n651\n00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,460\nSo you don't actually print via NFC.\n\n652\n00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,610\nNFC's too slow.\n\n653\n00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,050\nYou're just exchanging\nsecurity credentials so\n\n654\n00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,220\nthat you can then communicate,\nusually with Wi-Fi Direct or\n\n655\n00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,040\nsome other wireless networking\ntechnology that's faster than NFC.\n\n656\n00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,920\nYeah. All right. I don't know why,\n\n657\n00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,080\nthe first time I saw this I envisioned\nsomebody literally bringing their desktop\n\n658\n00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,590\ncomputer and\ntrying to tap it on the printer.\n\n659\n00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,820\nYeah.\nI know that's not the truth but\n\n660\n00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,760\nthat's how I envisioned it\nthe first time and I'm like wow,\n\n661\n00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,720\nthat's kind of weird that somebody\nwould actually need to do that.\n\n662\n00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,070\nDon, have you seen this really\nin where you had worked before?\n\n663\n00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,020\nNo.\n\n664\n00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,580\nNFC is still a very new technology, and\nsome of this is gaining acceptance.\n\n665\n00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,420\nMost laptops and desktops don't have\nNFC transmitters or receivers in them.\n\n666\n00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,090\nRight.\nSo,\n\n667\n00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,460\nwe're not seeing widespread acceptance of\nthis yet but on mobile devices, we are.\n\n668\n00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:36,990\nYea.\n\n669\n00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,870\nAndroid phones became popular about a year\nago, and or two years ago, I guess.\n\n670\n00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,300\nSure.\nAnd even on the iPhone.\n\n671\n00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,960\nYeah.\nYou're starting to see NFC, so\n\n672\n00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,182\nit is catching on there because it can be\nused for mobile payments and all that.\n\n673\n00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:49,786\nYeah.\nI've got pulled up, the HP page here.\n\n674\n00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:53,730\nTheir webpage, and\nyou'll see right here on HP's webpage.\n\n675\n00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,339\nWith their multifunction printers,\nthe MFPs.\n\n676\n00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:00,241\nThey're really pushing that whole\ntouch to print right here, right?\n\n677\n00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:03,740\nBut even they're showing a cell\nphone touching the printer.\n\n678\n00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,620\nNot like your laptop.\n\n679\n00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,110\nSo if you got a laptop, expect\nthe use the wireless printing to it or\n\n680\n00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,580\nwhatever, which is really\nnot that hard to do.\n\n681\n00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,100\nYeah, so, all right.\n\n682\n00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,950\nSo those are some of the things\nto think about with printers.\n\n683\n00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,870\nOn the NFC side, you don't usually\nhave a whole lotta errors.\n\n684\n00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,500\nThe main problems I've\nseen is where people have\n\n685\n00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,320\ndisabled their wireless antenna.\n\n686\n00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,490\nAnd so they've got NFC.\n\n687\n00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,060\nAnd they tap the printer and the printer\ndoes the tap of print stuff but\n\n688\n00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,722\nthen they can't communicate over wireless.\n\n689\n00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:33,160\nPeople don't realize that\nit doesn't print over NFC.\n\n690\n00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,330\nThat's usually the problem that creeps up.\n\n691\n00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,810\nSo that's really about it on those.\n\n692\n00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,290\nThe other thing is NFC is just\na communications protocol.\n\n693\n00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,220\nIt doesn't enable you\nto talk to the printer,\n\n694\n00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,360\nyou do need an application\nfrom that vendor.\n\n695\n00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,510\nSo, with HP,\nyou need the HP software installed.\n\n696\n00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,890\nAnd if you don't have that, then you're\nnot gonna be able to do the touch.\n\n697\n00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,190\nAll right, so Ronnie,\nthat's about all I've got on printers.\n\n698\n00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,750\nI know we still haven't talked about\nhow to dive in to those memory dumps.\n\n699\n00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,907\nWe'll do that a little bit later.\n\n700\n00:33:03,907 --> 00:33:06,391\nBut I think that's it.\n\n701\n00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:09,537\nLet me look at the objectives here,\nmake sure we didn't miss anything.\n\n702\n00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:12,610\nYes, that's really about it.\n\n703\n00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,670\nAll right, so why don't we do this cuz\nwe're kind of at the end of this segment.\n\n704\n00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,210\nSo why don't we stop and take a break.\n\n705\n00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,790\nWhen we get back we've got more,\nwe're gonna take a look.\n\n706\n00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,950\nOh, we've got cool stuff\ncoming up next don't we?\n\n707\n00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,020\nSo we're gonna take a look at\nthe disaster and recovery toolkit.\n\n708\n00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,010\nRight.\nMSDaRT which is pretty awesome.\n\n709\n00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,260\nAnd then we'll take a look at breaking\nsome of those memory dumps and\n\n710\n00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,180\nsome of the other things there.\n\n711\n00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,630\nSo good stuff to be coming,\njust stay tuned.\n\n712\n00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,796\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n713\n00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:38,666\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n714\n00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:44,346\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n715\n00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:47,288\nSo, we were talking about some of\nthe high-level tools we have for\n\n716\n00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:48,190\ntroubleshooting.\n\n717\n00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,260\nWe looked at printers and\ndevice manager and things like that.\n\n718\n00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,030\nBut what about those\nextra tricky problems,\n\n719\n00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,760\nthe ones that you just can't nail down,\nright?\n\n720\n00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,219\nThe computers randomly rebooting, and you\nask the end user, okay, what's changed and\n\n721\n00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:05,305\nwhat do they say?\n\n722\n00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,605\nSame thing they always say.\n\n723\n00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:07,535\nNothing's changed.\n\n724\n00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:09,225\nI didn't install anything.\n\n725\n00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:12,165\nMeanwhile, they've installed 20 new\napps and done all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n726\n00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:16,435\nThose kinda problems,\nintermittent problems,\n\n727\n00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:18,980\nthose are really hard to troubleshoot.\n\n728\n00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,470\nBecause sometimes you can't recreate them,\nright?\n\n729\n00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,050\nA random reboot throughout the day,\nhow do you recreate that?\n\n730\n00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,680\nYou can sit there and\nwatch it 24 hours a day, I guess.\n\n731\n00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,350\nI don't know.\nYou've had these before, right Ronnie?\n\n732\n00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,860\nYeah, random reboots, yeah.\n\n733\n00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,950\nWhen these things start happening,\nright, you again go.\n\n734\n00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,330\nAnd what we try to do, of course,\nis the basic troubleshooting steps.\n\n735\n00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,410\nAnd really looking at the event\nlogs as much as we can.\n\n736\n00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,240\nTo try and\nfigure out what could've caused it.\n\n737\n00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,900\nTaking away the reliability analyzer.\n\n738\n00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,690\nSeeing what's actually occurring over and\nover again here.\n\n739\n00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,060\nBut there are actually a bunch of\ntools that Microsoft has come up with\n\n740\n00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,980\nthat really do help.\n\n741\n00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,780\nNow a lotta the tools are not built\ndirectly into Windows itself.\n\n742\n00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,160\nThese are ones that you\nusually have to download.\n\n743\n00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,230\nOr again there's a combination of tools\nthat you have to put together and\n\n744\n00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,140\nmake this work.\n\n745\n00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,100\nBut it is real handy for\n\n746\n00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,440\nsomebody that is troubleshooting\nWindows to actually have this.\n\n747\n00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,900\nSo let's talk about one\nof those tools right now,\n\n748\n00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,130\nthe Windows Performance Toolkit.\n\n749\n00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,960\nI've got the webpage pulled\nup here on my laptop.\n\n750\n00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,670\nThe WPT, it's not included with Windows.\n\n751\n00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,470\nBut you go and download it from Microsoft.\n\n752\n00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,380\nIt's free, they don't charge you for it.\n\n753\n00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,940\nBut it is a collection of tools and\n\n754\n00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,200\nsoftware that let's you troubleshoot\nthese weird intermittent problems.\n\n755\n00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,340\nNow these tools are not for\nthe faint of heart.\n\n756\n00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,020\nThey are somewhat complex, right?\n\n757\n00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,510\nBut when you install the WPT,\nbasically you have a little screen.\n\n758\n00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,910\nYou check off the options that\nyou want and you install.\n\n759\n00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,770\nThere's not much to installing it.\n\n760\n00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:46,700\nBut once it's installed you get some\nof the tools that are really useful.\n\n761\n00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,190\nAnd that's what Microsoft is calling\nout in this particular objective.\n\n762\n00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,017\nWhere they're saying optimize performance\nusing the Windows Performance Toolkit.\n\n763\n00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:56,556\nAnd then they go to list a bunch\nof tools that you may, or\n\n764\n00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:58,500\nmay not have ever heard of before.\n\n765\n00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,241\nThese are all part of the WPT.\n\n766\n00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:03,353\nNow, there are some\ncommand line utilities.\n\n767\n00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:06,825\nYou'll see Xperf,\nX Xbootmgr and XperfView.\n\n768\n00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:11,325\nThose are for the performance monitor as\nwell as the boot manager to be able to see\n\n769\n00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:14,270\nwhat's going on, on your system there.\n\n770\n00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,920\nThere's also a graphical user interface,\nthough,\n\n771\n00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,860\na GUI which is part of\nthe Windows Performance Recorder and\n\n772\n00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,290\nAnalyzer that we're gonna see\nhere in a minute, all right?\n\n773\n00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,380\nYou use the command line utilities for\n\n774\n00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,400\nwhen you're trying to trigger these\nthings to run like a boot time.\n\n775\n00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,450\nOr, whatever if you're\ntrying to automate it.\n\n776\n00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,160\nOh yeah, scripts,\nthat'd be a perfect example.\n\n777\n00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,479\nThe GUI on the other hand is\nwhat we use when we wanna do it.\n\n778\n00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:37,364\n[LAUGH] Right.\n\n779\n00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,970\nWhen we actually wanna mostly\ninteract ourselves, all right.\n\n780\n00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,740\nSo the way it works is really simple.\n\n781\n00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,000\nYou fire up either Xperf from\nthe command line to gather data.\n\n782\n00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,600\nOr you fire up\nthe Windows Performance Recorder.\n\n783\n00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,690\nAnd when you install it,\nit adds it in here.\n\n784\n00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,870\nSo we'll see the Windows\nPerformance Recorder right there.\n\n785\n00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,230\nAnd you launch that,\nwhich I think I'm already running.\n\n786\n00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,920\nAnd when you run it,\nyou see this screen right here.\n\n787\n00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,800\nAnd it is, basically, chocablock\nfull of options that are saying,\n\n788\n00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,090\nall right,\nyou're about to start recording data.\n\n789\n00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,250\nWhat do you wanna record and\nhow do you wanna record it, all right?\n\n790\n00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,870\nSo you'll see the the default.\n\n791\n00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,280\nAnd I've checked a few of\nthese options already.\n\n792\n00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,160\nSo let me close out of this thing.\n\n793\n00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,240\nI'll start it all over again.\n\n794\n00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,090\nSo it goes back to its defaults.\n\n795\n00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,800\nSo I'm running my\nWindows Performance Recorder.\n\n796\n00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,420\nAnd oh, you remembered my settings.\n\n797\n00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,456\nWell let me here, I'll just put it back.\n\n798\n00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:33,940\nThis is what it looks like normally.\n\n799\n00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,290\nAll right, and you'll see that it's\ngot first level triage is selected.\n\n800\n00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,760\nAnd first level triage, that's\na collection of very basic settings.\n\n801\n00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,350\nIt's what your basic performance settings,\nyour average processor,\n\n802\n00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:51,450\naverage disk queueing,\nwhat applications are running.\n\n803\n00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,180\nWhat event messages are being generated,\njust very, very simple.\n\n804\n00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,886\nAnd then you can add onto it much\nmore advanced stuff, CPU usage,\n\n805\n00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:01,370\nDisk I/O, File I/O, and so on.\n\n806\n00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:05,159\nAnd in each of the different things that\nwe can kinda heap in there to monitor\n\n807\n00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,830\nand record.\n\n808\n00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,660\nNow Don, the nice thing is over there on\nthe right-hand side where you have that\n\n809\n00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,550\nperformance scenario,\nyou click on that first drop-down.\n\n810\n00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,460\nThey've already got some of these\nalready kind of pre-built, like I guess,\n\n811\n00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,870\ntemplates would be kinda the idea here.\n\n812\n00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,110\nSo if you're not sure exactly what you\ncan pick, maybe being you should do some\n\n813\n00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,490\nof this when you're experiencing\na problem with a boot.\n\n814\n00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,660\nOr the slow startup, and stuff like that.\n\n815\n00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,700\nYou can actually run through these instead\nand that might help you out as well.\n\n816\n00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,965\nYeah, absolutely.\nYeah.\n\n817\n00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:32,970\nAnd you also see like the detail level.\n\n818\n00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,260\nGenerally you want verbose, you don't\nwant light, you're troubleshooting.\n\n819\n00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,480\nBut then this last one, logging mode.\n\n820\n00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,580\nAll right,\ndo you wanna log to memory or file?\n\n821\n00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,070\nIf you're gonna be walking away from\nthis machine, you wanna log the file.\n\n822\n00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,766\nAll right, but you can choose\nto log the memory if you want.\n\n823\n00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:50,672\nI never do, I almost always log the file,\n\n824\n00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:53,480\nbecause of how we're gonna\nanalyze it afterwards.\n\n825\n00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,180\nRight, when you get that set,\n\n826\n00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,830\nyou just hit the Start button\nwhich is right up here at the top.\n\n827\n00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,530\nAnd then it starts recording and basically\nit just collects that information, and\n\n828\n00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,710\nit runs for a period of time.\n\n829\n00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,360\nNow this morning I monitored my laptop for\nabout 30 minutes.\n\n830\n00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,830\nI didn't intend for it to go that long,\nbut I kinda forgot it was running.\n\n831\n00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,580\nSo I monitor my laptop for\nabout 30 minutes.\n\n832\n00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:16,550\nAnd when it's done, it saves this\nas a file on your hard drive, and\n\n833\n00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,060\nit'll show you the path when it's done.\n\n834\n00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,980\nWhen it's done,\nyou can then fire up the analyzer.\n\n835\n00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,220\nThat's the other piece to this,\nthe Windows Performance Analyzer,\n\n836\n00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,700\nthis guy right here.\n\n837\n00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,400\nAnd you can open up that\nfile that you generated.\n\n838\n00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,740\nAnd I've still got mine open from this\nmorning, or at least I hope I do.\n\n839\n00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,200\nCuz it's not the fastest\nutility in the world.\n\n840\n00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,080\nAnd let me close this.\n\n841\n00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,150\nAll right, when you open up a file made\nwith the Windows Performance Recorder,\n\n842\n00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,747\nthis is what you get.\n\n843\n00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:45,941\nYeah.\nThis is a readout over here just little\n\n844\n00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:49,358\nsummaries of all the different\nthings that were collected.\n\n845\n00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:51,284\nAnd you'll see system activity.\n\n846\n00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:54,605\nComputation, storage, memory, power.\n\n847\n00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:55,325\nMm-hm.\n\n848\n00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:56,138\nAll right.\n\n849\n00:39:56,138 --> 00:39:59,655\nPower is great for seeing when the machine\nrebooted, if it rebooted, right?\n\n850\n00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:02,530\nMonitoring that kind of stuff and so on.\n\n851\n00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,050\nIt's all rendered in GUI\nwhich is really handy.\n\n852\n00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,136\nRight.\nNow the exam objectives,\n\n853\n00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:08,830\nthey call out x perf view.\n\n854\n00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,179\nThat's the older utility.\n\n855\n00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:14,089\nAnd I say older, it's not that old,\ntwo years maybe.\n\n856\n00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:17,045\n[LAUGH] But it's the utility that we\nused to use to monitor this data.\n\n857\n00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:19,630\nIt's no longer supported by Microsoft.\n\n858\n00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,160\nOn their website they say expert\nview is no longer supported.\n\n859\n00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,450\nThey want you to use\nthe Windows Performance Analyzer and\n\n860\n00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,350\nthat's what I'm showing here.\n\n861\n00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,022\nBoth are included in the Performance\nToolkit, so you get both of them.\n\n862\n00:40:30,022 --> 00:40:31,450\nYeah.\n\n863\n00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,927\nNow, what you do is you basically use\nthis information to drill down and\n\n864\n00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:35,590\nfind out what was going on in your system.\n\n865\n00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:39,190\nOne of my favorite ones is if\nyou go under System Activity.\n\n866\n00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,630\nYou can come in here, and\nyou can find Window in Focus.\n\n867\n00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,262\nI love this one.\n\n868\n00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:45,850\nYeah.\nI'm just gonna right click and\n\n869\n00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,150\nchoose to add graph to analysis view,\nand that's gonna stick it over here.\n\n870\n00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,560\nAnd what this does,\n\n871\n00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,470\nis it lets me see what program\nsomebody was using at a certain time.\n\n872\n00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:00,890\nSo if there was a crash at 12 AM,\nI just come through here and\n\n873\n00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:05,590\nfind 12 AM, and\nI see which program had focus.\n\n874\n00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,930\nThat will let me know what\nprogram was running at that time.\n\n875\n00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:12,660\nSo if it happened right here,\nI can see IExplorer.exe.\n\n876\n00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,810\nInternet Explorer had focus.\n\n877\n00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,580\nLet me zoom in a little bit so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n878\n00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,840\nSo Internet Explorer has focus,\nright there, and\n\n879\n00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,070\nI can see some general\ninformation about it.\n\n880\n00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,211\nHow long it had been running,\nwhen it started, when it ended.\n\n881\n00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:30,161\nAnd the time is all in\nreference to the Microsoft\n\n882\n00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:33,240\nuniversal date time stamp they use.\n\n883\n00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,160\nSo the times are kinda written weird.\n\n884\n00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,450\nBut we can start to see that,\n\n885\n00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,330\nwe can see other programs\nthat might have been running.\n\n886\n00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,990\nWhat program is this?\n\n887\n00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,870\nInternet, I mean, regular Explorer, right?\n\n888\n00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,070\nSo I browsed for files or something.\n\n889\n00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,970\nWho knows what I do half\nthe time these days.\n\n890\n00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,543\nIt looks like I had another\ninstance of Internet Explorer, so\n\n891\n00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:50,858\nI had more than one copy of\nInternet Explorer running.\n\n892\n00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:54,830\nWhich is not unusual for me.\n\n893\n00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,699\nBut yeah, you can browse through and\nsee just what program was running,\n\n894\n00:41:58,699 --> 00:41:59,720\nwhat was going on.\n\n895\n00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,220\nThis one, what was this?\n\n896\n00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,140\nMore Internet Explorer.\n\n897\n00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,215\nGeez, how many processes\ndid I have running?\n\n898\n00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:08,140\n[LAUGH] See this is where you can find\nout how many tabs of Internet Explorer\n\n899\n00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,365\nsomebody had,\ncuz each tab is an isolated process.\n\n900\n00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:14,135\nConsent.exe, I wonder what that was?\n\n901\n00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:18,130\n[LAUGH] You probably had to actually say,\nclick Yes.\n\n902\n00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,530\nYeah, I had to confirm\nsome dialogue boxes.\n\n903\n00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,540\niVGA PRO,\nthat's my screen sharing software.\n\n904\n00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,530\nSo we can start to see what was\nrunning where, and get an idea of,\n\n905\n00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,440\nhey, you had a crash, these are the\nprograms that were running at that time.\n\n906\n00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,540\nAnd here's what was in focus.\n\n907\n00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,840\nAll right.\n\n908\n00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,490\nYou can also pull up generic events.\n\n909\n00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,760\nLet me add this one.\n\n910\n00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,836\nThis one's kinda fun.\n\n911\n00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:43,203\nBecause what it's doing is\ncataloging all sorts of\n\n912\n00:42:43,203 --> 00:42:46,080\nevents that happened at particular times.\n\n913\n00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,690\nAnd it's got all these symbols that\nrepresent when the event occurred\n\n914\n00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,600\nand so on.\n\n915\n00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,470\nAnd so you'll see there's quite a bit\nof information to be found in here.\n\n916\n00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,565\nAnd if I pick one of these, let me just\ndraw a focus on one, so here's Chrome and\n\n917\n00:42:59,565 --> 00:43:04,450\nwith my screen zoomed in like this I\nprobably can't show all the details.\n\n918\n00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,670\nBut basically what you do is\nyou find your problem point.\n\n919\n00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,250\nYou kinda go in here and\nyou highlight where it is.\n\n920\n00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,610\nAnd then down here, it's breaking down\nall of the events that were going on\n\n921\n00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,880\nat that very particular moment.\n\n922\n00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,970\nThis is a ton of information.\n\n923\n00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,964\nYeah.\nAnd it's really designed for developers,\n\n924\n00:43:22,964 --> 00:43:23,790\nprogrammers.\n\n925\n00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,830\nYou know,\nyou're troubleshooting your application.\n\n926\n00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,705\nBut as an administrator,\nwe can benefit from some of this also.\n\n927\n00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:31,282\nRight.\nIt does take a lot of effort to kind\n\n928\n00:43:31,282 --> 00:43:34,270\nof pilfer through this and\nfind the information you want.\n\n929\n00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:37,773\nBut this will get you a lot more details\nabout a problem than what you could get\n\n930\n00:43:37,773 --> 00:43:38,337\nnormally.\n\n931\n00:43:38,337 --> 00:43:38,878\nYeah.\n\n932\n00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:40,790\nAnd Don we're talking about\nrunning this for 30 minutes.\n\n933\n00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,010\nThis file can grow so\n\n934\n00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,940\nyou have to be careful about\nwhere this is gonna be stored.\n\n935\n00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,336\nYou have again, a hard drive which is\nfairly small in terms of free space.\n\n936\n00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:54,366\nMake sure that you actually take\na look at this as well, okay?\n\n937\n00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,760\nDon't let it go for days, and [LAUGH].\n\n938\n00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,400\nSo it can actually overwhelm the machine.\n\n939\n00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,530\nSo just kind of be aware of that.\n\n940\n00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,183\nCuz you see how much it tracks.\n\n941\n00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:04,915\nI mean, it can track everything.\n\n942\n00:44:04,915 --> 00:44:06,440\nYeah.\nSo yeah, it's pretty hefty.\n\n943\n00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,384\nAnd just look like here, I added in,\nI'm telling it to render for\n\n944\n00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:12,080\nme CPU usage by process.\n\n945\n00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,340\nSo it's gonna show me what\nprocesses were using CPU.\n\n946\n00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,036\nAnd it's taking my computer, now I've\ngot an i7, and the file is being loaded\n\n947\n00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:23,840\noff of an SSD, so this is pretty\nmuch as quick as we can get today.\n\n948\n00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,660\nRight.\nAnd it's still\n\n949\n00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,855\ntaking my system a little\nwhile to parse through that.\n\n950\n00:44:26,855 --> 00:44:29,455\nUh-huh.\nAnd, but now once it's done,\n\n951\n00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:34,793\nI can come in here and I can see who was\nconsuming CPU at a very particular time,\n\n952\n00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:39,170\nor just on average who was\nconsuming the most CPU utilization.\n\n953\n00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:42,545\nAnd so you can skim through here and\nhopefully you see idle, like I do.\n\n954\n00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:45,920\nThat's a good thing, you want idle\nto be the number one consumer.\n\n955\n00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,550\nAnd then after that I\ncan see DWM.exe which,\n\n956\n00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:54,430\nisn't that part of like the Dell stuff or,\noh no, that's the window manager.\n\n957\n00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,010\nYeah.\nSo yeah, that's part of Windows.\n\n958\n00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,500\nAnd then IVGA after that.\n\n959\n00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,920\nSo you can really start to break down and\n\n960\n00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,310\nfind out what was the culprit\nwhen you had that crash.\n\n961\n00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,166\nWho was taking up all the CPU or\nwhatever at that particular time.\n\n962\n00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,175\nVery, very cool utility.\n\n963\n00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:09,115\nYeah.\n\n964\n00:45:09,115 --> 00:45:12,095\nAnd just all part of this toolkit,\nthat's available for free.\n\n965\n00:45:12,095 --> 00:45:14,965\nYou can go to Microsoft's website,\ndownload it, and have some fun with it.\n\n966\n00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:18,558\nYeah so both of those,\nin the Window's Performance Toolkit and\n\n967\n00:45:18,558 --> 00:45:23,295\nthe actual Recorder portion of it, these\ncome together and that Recorder portion.\n\n968\n00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:25,990\nI do want to point out\nthe extension of the file name,\n\n969\n00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,755\ncuz sometimes it can get\ncalled out on the exam.\n\n970\n00:45:28,755 --> 00:45:33,340\nThis is .etl and you know,\nright off the top of my head,\n\n971\n00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,700\nit all of a sudden escaped me.\n\n972\n00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,750\nI didn't know what this thing stood for,\nbut\n\n973\n00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,795\nit is a .etl file so-\nIt's an event trace log.\n\n974\n00:45:39,795 --> 00:45:41,295\nYeah, trace log, yeah, event trace log.\n\n975\n00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:42,842\nI was gonna say,\nI know it's some type of log but\n\n976\n00:45:42,842 --> 00:45:44,500\nI couldn't remember what it stood for.\n\n977\n00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,220\nBut the event trace log, right.\n\n978\n00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,680\nSo when you're gonna actually end up\nusing that performance recorder here\n\n979\n00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,750\nto essentially generate\nthat event trace log.\n\n980\n00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,250\nAnd then that's the same file that\nwill then be analyzed by that\n\n981\n00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,835\nWindows performance analyzer as well.\n\n982\n00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:01,655\nSo again, not the most exciting\ninformation I can pass out, but it is\n\n983\n00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:07,085\nsomething that you may actually see again,\nso do make sure you know that as well.\n\n984\n00:46:07,085 --> 00:46:09,420\nYeah, here, let me browse and\nshow them the files that I generated.\n\n985\n00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,170\nOh, yeah, that'd be great.\n\n986\n00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:14,387\nLet me just fire up yet\nanother, see here, I go,\n\n987\n00:46:14,387 --> 00:46:18,270\nmore instances of Explorer,\nI'll see how many I can get.\n\n988\n00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:18,795\n[LAUGH].\n\n989\n00:46:18,795 --> 00:46:22,570\nSo the default is it puts\nit into your user profile.\n\n990\n00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:28,390\nSo c:\\Users\\ whatever your\nusername is \\Documents\\WPR files.\n\n991\n00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:30,770\nWPR being\nthe Windows Performance Recorder.\n\n992\n00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,840\nAnd then you can see the ETL files.\n\n993\n00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,950\nNow, there's gonna be multiple parts\ndepending on what you choose to record.\n\n994\n00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,570\nIf you just do the first level triage,\nyou really just have one ETL file.\n\n995\n00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,830\nBut if you choose other\nperformance categories like I did.\n\n996\n00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:43,540\nYeah.\n\n997\n00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,740\nCPU, disk IO, all that stuff,\nyou'll get a subfolder also.\n\n998\n00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,868\nNow I ran for 30 minutes.\n\n999\n00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:53,121\n[LAUGH] And if you look at the size\non that file, it's about five megs.\n\n1000\n00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:55,128\nYeah.\nOr wait, am I reading that wrong?\n\n1001\n00:46:55,128 --> 00:46:55,920\nIs that five gigs?\n\n1002\n00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,380\nHang on, that's- 5 million kilobytes.\n\n1003\n00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,630\nK, meg, gig, yeah, so\nI did five gigs in 30 minutes.\n\n1004\n00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,349\nThat adds up pretty quick, right?\n\n1005\n00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:04,960\nYeah.\nSo, five gigs in 30 minutes.\n\n1006\n00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,040\nIf we ran this for 24 hours,\nwe'd really hurt ourselves.\n\n1007\n00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,500\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n1008\n00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,920\nIt's recording a ton of data.\n\n1009\n00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,460\nAnd so the ETL file for\nmine is right there.\n\n1010\n00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,286\nAnd then I've got this subfolder that\njust has additional information that was\n\n1011\n00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:21,790\ncataloged at the time.\n\n1012\n00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:23,698\nAnd these'd be things\nlike registry changes,\n\n1013\n00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:25,910\nI thing I turned on registry\nmonitoring in mine.\n\n1014\n00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,280\nSo any registry keys that changed\nwould have got logged in here.\n\n1015\n00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,330\nAnd it does add up very, very quickly.\n\n1016\n00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,086\nYeah.\nLet's get the full size report on that.\n\n1017\n00:47:34,086 --> 00:47:39,120\n4.81 gigs, 5.1 gigs on disk,\nyeah so- [LAUGH] That's hefty.\n\n1018\n00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,045\nQuite a bit.\n\n1019\n00:47:40,045 --> 00:47:40,545\nYeah.\n\n1020\n00:47:40,545 --> 00:47:42,505\nBut yeah, those are the files,\nthey do end in etl,\n\n1021\n00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:44,885\nalthough it's hard to see zoomed\nout like that, there we go.\n\n1022\n00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:46,790\nSo they do end in etl, easy to spot.\n\n1023\n00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,436\nAnd then when you're done with them,\nyou delete them.\n\n1024\n00:47:48,436 --> 00:47:50,294\nNo sense in wasting space.\n\n1025\n00:47:50,294 --> 00:47:52,639\nI should probably do that myself.\n\n1026\n00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,622\n[LAUGH] There.\n\n1027\n00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,562\nSo [LAUGH] so there we go.\n\n1028\n00:47:55,562 --> 00:47:56,271\nBut really cool stuff.\n\n1029\n00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:57,780\nYeah.\n\n1030\n00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,770\nAll right, now that's a deep dive,\nthose are very technical tools.\n\n1031\n00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,970\nWhat if you want something like that, but\n\n1032\n00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:08,690\nyou don't want to have the learn\nthe Windows performance toolkit.\n\n1033\n00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,320\nYou don't want to go crazy with all this.\n\n1034\n00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,671\nWell, you can always use the performance\nmonitor that's built into Windows,\n\n1035\n00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:16,316\nthat's been in Windows- Right, forever.\n\n1036\n00:48:16,316 --> 00:48:17,660\nSince yeah, forever.\n\n1037\n00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,710\nReally a long time.\n\n1038\n00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:23,920\nThat we can use that, and it gives us not\nas deep of a dive, not as deep of a view.\n\n1039\n00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,050\nBut an overall view of\nthe performance of our system.\n\n1040\n00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,650\nIt generates a much smaller data set,\nwhich means we can run it for\n\n1041\n00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,970\nhours upon hours and\nnot fill up our harddrive with log files.\n\n1042\n00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,500\nBut it's not as detailed.\n\n1043\n00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,040\nSo for a developer,\nit's not gonna be enough information.\n\n1044\n00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,940\nFor a system admin- Yeah.\n\n1045\n00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,619\nThough like us, then that may be\nthe perfect amount of information we need.\n\n1046\n00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,050\nNow the performance monitor,\nlet me just fire it up.\n\n1047\n00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,470\nNow when I do my oh, you know what?\n\n1048\n00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,679\nI can't search for performance anymore.\n\n1049\n00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:54,581\nThey changed- Perfmon [CROSSTALK]\nThat with the search.\n\n1050\n00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:56,830\nYeah, I have to do perfmon.\n\n1051\n00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:00,670\nPerfmon is the performance monitor and\nfor whatever reason in windows 8.1.\n\n1052\n00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,601\nYeah.\n\n1053\n00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:03,094\nThey've got the search anywhere and\n\n1054\n00:49:03,094 --> 00:49:05,230\nthe performance keyword no\nlonger hits on it- Yeah.\n\n1055\n00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:06,900\nWhich is is frustrating.\n\n1056\n00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,560\nBut the performance monitor,\n\n1057\n00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,150\nthis guy right here, is built into\nwindows, I know it was there in NT 4,\n\n1058\n00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,900\nI don't remember if it was there in\nNT 3.51, if it was I never used it.\n\n1059\n00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,540\n[LAUGH] But\nit's been there since at least NT 4.\n\n1060\n00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,770\nYeah.\nAnd they've added more and\n\n1061\n00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:23,730\nmore to it over the years to\nmake it more and more powerful.\n\n1062\n00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,380\nYeah.\n\n1063\n00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,420\nRemember that for us in terms of\nperformance, these are normally when\n\n1064\n00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,590\npeople are complaining a lot of times\nabout hey, this is loading slowly or\n\n1065\n00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:37,690\nthe very fact that again the hard drive\nspace or whatever it might be here.\n\n1066\n00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:42,590\nThis normally gives us those overviews of\nthose four main performance ideas that we\n\n1067\n00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:48,110\nactually tent to deal with hard drive,\nCPU, network, and RAM, memory.\n\n1068\n00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,940\nSo we would normally see\na lot of information here.\n\n1069\n00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,560\nBut not as detailed as\nwhat we just saw though.\n\n1070\n00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,067\nAnd when you come in here if you just got\nto performance monitor, you'll see- Yeah.\n\n1071\n00:49:58,067 --> 00:49:58,630\nJust CPU now.\n\n1072\n00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,870\nThey used to actually- Yeah.\n\n1073\n00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,920\nHave the big four loaded for us.\n\n1074\n00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,857\nBut this is a real time- Yup.\n\n1075\n00:50:03,857 --> 00:50:06,800\nAs the computer is right\nnow view of my system.\n\n1076\n00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,640\nHow much CPU am I consuming?\n\n1077\n00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,940\nAnd if that's what I am troubleshooting,\n\n1078\n00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,810\nif I am troubleshooting a problem\nthat is going on right now.\n\n1079\n00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,260\nThen the performance monitor is great.\n\n1080\n00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:14,870\nRight.\n\n1081\n00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,000\nBut if I'm troubleshooting a problem\nthat's intermittent, that comes and goes.\n\n1082\n00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,910\nThat isn't necessarily here right now.\n\n1083\n00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,500\nThat's where I need performance\nmonitor logs and alerts.\n\n1084\n00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,400\nAnd I know we covered\nthis in the 687 show.\n\n1085\n00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,080\nBut we bring it up here, because we need\nto understand when to use these tools.\n\n1086\n00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080\nSo the performance monitor is for\n\n1087\n00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,130\nreal time troubleshooting\nwhat's going on right now.\n\n1088\n00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:41,041\nAnd the data collector sets here,\nwhere we do these logs over time.\n\n1089\n00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:44,080\nThese are for\nintermittent problems that come and go.\n\n1090\n00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,470\nThe tools are the same.\n\n1091\n00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,480\nRight.\nThey're the same tools.\n\n1092\n00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,410\nThe only difference is when we\ndo the data collector sets,\n\n1093\n00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:55,620\nwe're storing information for long-term\nreview, versus the performance monitor.\n\n1094\n00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,357\nThis guy is used for\nshort-term instantaneous troubleshooting,\n\n1095\n00:50:58,357 --> 00:50:59,610\notherwise they're the same.\n\n1096\n00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,166\nYeah.\n\n1097\n00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,119\nAll right.\n\n1098\n00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,237\nIf you don't know how to use these,\n\n1099\n00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:06,635\nwe do do a deeper kind of\nevaluation of them in the 687.\n\n1100\n00:51:06,635 --> 00:51:08,260\nSo you can jump over and check that out.\n\n1101\n00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,590\nI think most of you have\nprobably already watched that.\n\n1102\n00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:12,600\nBut just to kind of quickly review.\n\n1103\n00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,610\nIf I know there's a problem on the system\nbut I don't know when it's going to occur.\n\n1104\n00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,630\nI can come in here under\ndata collector sets and\n\n1105\n00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,770\nwe can use some of the pre-built ones.\n\n1106\n00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,550\nThere's the system performance and\ndiagnostic ones that are built in or\n\n1107\n00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,470\nwe can create our own data collector\nset that monitors whatever we want.\n\n1108\n00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:30,100\nRight?\nYup.\n\n1109\n00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,960\nAnd I think you can even\ncopy some of these.\n\n1110\n00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,120\nBut if I want to come in here and\n\n1111\n00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,930\ncreate a new one myself,\nI'll create a new data collector set.\n\n1112\n00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,590\nAnd I will create it from a template.\n\n1113\n00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:44,340\nAnd I'm gonna pick system performance.\n\n1114\n00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,310\nSo I'm gonna be monitoring\nperformance on my system.\n\n1115\n00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,400\nSo I'm using a template just\nto get a good starting place.\n\n1116\n00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,910\nAnd then I can come in and I can edit it.\n\n1117\n00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,330\nAnd you'll see where it's monitoring\nperformance counters, and\n\n1118\n00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,060\nNT Kernel activities.\n\n1119\n00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:02,320\nSo kernel space activities driver calls,\nthings of that nature.\n\n1120\n00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,600\nAnd we can even add in more, if we want.\n\n1121\n00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:10,200\nIf we want to start monitoring things like\nregistry is normally the one that we want.\n\n1122\n00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:15,440\nSo if I do a new data collector, and\nI tell it to collect configuration data.\n\n1123\n00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:23,280\nAll right, so this is saying basically,\nI want it to collect registry changes.\n\n1124\n00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,340\nSo I might want to add in H key local\nmachines software, that's not a bad one.\n\n1125\n00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:34,480\nAnd H key current user software,\nall right.\n\n1126\n00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,450\nSo any changes in those two hives,\nI wanna go ahead and collect.\n\n1127\n00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,532\nAnd so I'll go ahead and finish those, and\n\n1128\n00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:46,580\nthen I might also add Event trace, right?\n\n1129\n00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:52,380\nSo any event log messages\nthat happen during this time,\n\n1130\n00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,560\nI wanna record those also.\n\n1131\n00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,220\nAnd we could do specific providers.\n\n1132\n00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,450\nGenerally, you want that or if you leave\nit blank you have to get them all,\n\n1133\n00:52:58,450 --> 00:52:58,980\nwhich is fun.\n\n1134\n00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,420\nAll right, so now we've got those, and\n\n1135\n00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,820\nbasically we can just start this and\nlet it run.\n\n1136\n00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,450\nRight.\nSo we fire it up.\n\n1137\n00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,560\nIt starts running, it's recording.\n\n1138\n00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,900\nI come back 12 hours later.\n\n1139\n00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,480\nRight?\n\n1140\n00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,020\nAnd so if the problem is intermittent,\n\n1141\n00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,790\nif it creeps up at periods\nthroughout the day.\n\n1142\n00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,100\nThis is logging,\nit's logging it right to these files here.\n\n1143\n00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,870\nIt's telling me where it's log to.\n\n1144\n00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:23,820\nAnd so after the fact, I can come back and\ncollect that data, all right?\n\n1145\n00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,430\nSo pretty straightforward again,\nwhen we show how to use this in 687.\n\n1146\n00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:31,790\nFor the 688 exam the important\nthing to remember is we use these\n\n1147\n00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,950\nwhen we don't necessarily know when\nthe problem is going to occur.\n\n1148\n00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,250\nAnd then when it's done.\n\n1149\n00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:41,190\nAnd we can open all of this up and we can\nactually see what our CPU levels were?\n\n1150\n00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,520\nHow much RAM was available?\n\n1151\n00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,650\nWhat disk space was being used?\n\n1152\n00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:49,180\nWe can look at what event logs occur,\nwhat registry keys change?\n\n1153\n00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:52,275\nWe can see all that's trying to put\ntogether the big picture of what might be\n\n1154\n00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:54,604\nleading to this issue.\n\n1155\n00:53:54,604 --> 00:53:55,807\nYeah.\n\n1156\n00:53:55,807 --> 00:53:58,425\nAll right.\n\n1157\n00:53:58,425 --> 00:53:59,625\nLet me stop this.\n\n1158\n00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:02,487\n[LAUGH] Otherwise I'm going to do exactly\nwhat you told us to worry about, Ronnie.\n\n1159\n00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:03,420\n[LAUGH] Which is- Yeah.\n\n1160\n00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,145\nThey get big.\n\n1161\n00:54:04,145 --> 00:54:04,650\nYeah.\n\n1162\n00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,210\nThey can get big.\n\n1163\n00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,660\nAnd let's see.\n\n1164\n00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,975\nHere.\nI'm just gonna fire up the report.\n\n1165\n00:54:10,975 --> 00:54:13,230\n[INAUDIBLE] When it's done recording,\nyou can right-click on it and\n\n1166\n00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:16,220\nchoose to view the latest report.\n\n1167\n00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,670\nAnd then it'll queue it up down here.\n\n1168\n00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:21,030\nSo you can come in and you can see\nyour summary, your other information.\n\n1169\n00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,530\nHere, I can break down CPU by process.\n\n1170\n00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:29,010\nSo here I can see what processes are\nrunning and consuming what CPU, and so on.\n\n1171\n00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,254\nIt's all in here, it's good information.\n\n1172\n00:54:30,254 --> 00:54:30,903\nYeah.\n\n1173\n00:54:30,903 --> 00:54:34,590\nThis is easy to interpret than\nthe Windows performance toolkit.\n\n1174\n00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:38,089\nBut the Windows performance toolkit gives\nyou a much greater detail of information.\n\n1175\n00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:42,053\nYeah and in fact, where is that directory?\n\n1176\n00:54:42,053 --> 00:54:48,044\nIsn't it C:/windows/perfmon.\n\n1177\n00:54:48,044 --> 00:54:48,586\nNo.\n\n1178\n00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,230\nIf it's not, it's in System32, I believe.\n\n1179\n00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:55,910\nYeah, you found it.\n\n1180\n00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,430\nYep, that's it.\n\n1181\n00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,250\nThere it is.\nAll right, so\n\n1182\n00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,290\nif we look at all\nthe data I just recorded.\n\n1183\n00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,710\nOh no, these are from another time.\n\n1184\n00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,550\nThat's not mine.\n\n1185\n00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,425\nHang on,\nlet's see where it recorded that to.\n\n1186\n00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:11,446\nThere, C:\\perflogs.\n\n1187\n00:55:11,446 --> 00:55:13,860\nLet's go see how big that data set was.\n\n1188\n00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:18,255\nIf I go into C:perflogs,\nwhich you have to be an admin to get to.\n\n1189\n00:55:18,255 --> 00:55:19,540\n[LAUGH] Convenient.\n\n1190\n00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,789\nIt's gonna bug me all the way through,\nisn't it?\n\n1191\n00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:21,625\nOh, yeah.\n\n1192\n00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:22,519\nFun.\n\n1193\n00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,750\nAll right.\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Oh, man.\n\n1194\n00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:28,940\nReally.\n\n1195\n00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,280\nAnyhow.\nI just wanna see it seize, there.\n\n1196\n00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,065\nSo it just ran for a few minutes,\nand it's about 5 megs- Yeah.\n\n1197\n00:55:33,065 --> 00:55:33,860\nOf data.\nYeah.\n\n1198\n00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,510\nAnd so if I ran for 30 minutes,\nit's really not gonna be that big.\n\n1199\n00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:40,980\nYeah.\nIt might hit 100 megs- Yeah.\n\n1200\n00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,370\nFor 30 minutes versus the 5 gigs- Yeah.\n\n1201\n00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,290\nFor 30 minutes of this morning's report.\n\n1202\n00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:45,790\nSo.\n\n1203\n00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:47,900\nAll right.\n\n1204\n00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,260\nSo that's pretty much, what else does\nMicrosoft call out on this objective?\n\n1205\n00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,200\nThey've got data collector sets,\nthe task manager.\n\n1206\n00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,130\nYeah.\nThat's the one I left out.\n\n1207\n00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,009\nThe task manager,\nboy that thing's been around forever too.\n\n1208\n00:55:58,009 --> 00:55:58,869\nYeah.\n\n1209\n00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:01,735\nIt's one of my go to utilities for\ninstantly monitoring a system.\n\n1210\n00:56:01,735 --> 00:56:03,143\nYeah, the good thing is,\n\n1211\n00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:07,179\nyou can actually always access the task\nmanager relatively quickly here.\n\n1212\n00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:11,075\nAnd a lot of times, what did you do,\ndid you right-click on the taskbar?\n\n1213\n00:56:11,075 --> 00:56:11,850\nThat's kind of my habit.\n\n1214\n00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,460\nI just right-click down here and\nchoose Task Manager.\n\n1215\n00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,620\nYou can hit Ctrl+Alt+Delete and\nlaunch the Task Manager from there also,\n\n1216\n00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,470\nor you can run taskmgr,\nany one of those will do it.\n\n1217\n00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,430\nNow, this is not the task manager I\nremember from my Windows XP, Don.\n\n1218\n00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,647\nNo, it's changed a good bit.\n[LAUGH] Yeah, they made it better and\n\n1219\n00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:28,220\nbetter with each version of Windows.\n\n1220\n00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,268\nIt started with Windows Vista,\nthey started really adding more to it.\n\n1221\n00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:35,038\nSo, the new one, when you go in here,\nit starts with processes, and\n\n1222\n00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:39,003\nit's showing you the big four, CPU,\nMemory, Disk, and Network, for\n\n1223\n00:56:39,003 --> 00:56:42,460\neach of the applications that\nare running on your system.\n\n1224\n00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:46,570\nThis first screen usually has exactly\nwhat you need to troubleshoot a problem.\n\n1225\n00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:47,300\nYeah.\n\n1226\n00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,040\nRight.\n\n1227\n00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,923\nBut if you want more.\n\n1228\n00:56:48,923 --> 00:56:49,782\nRight.\nYeah.\n\n1229\n00:56:49,782 --> 00:56:50,555\nOne more.\n[LAUGH].\n\n1230\n00:56:50,555 --> 00:56:54,152\nWell, what you're used to, Ronnie,\nis if we go over to our Performance tab.\n\n1231\n00:56:54,152 --> 00:56:55,190\nOh, yeah, there it is.\n\n1232\n00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,610\nThat looks a little bit more better.\n\n1233\n00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,930\nYep, and\nthey have improved on this, right?\n\n1234\n00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:02,290\nYeah.\nIt used to just show CPU, now it does CPU,\n\n1235\n00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,120\nMemory, Disk, Ethernet.\n\n1236\n00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,090\nSo we've got all this information in here,\nand\n\n1237\n00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,300\nwe can start to break down\nkind of what's going on.\n\n1238\n00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,385\nNow, these are averages.\n\n1239\n00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:10,910\nYeah.\nSo it doesn't tell me what program\n\n1240\n00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:16,060\nis eating my CPU, but it does tell me that\nI'm running at about 30% on average CPU.\n\n1241\n00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:19,000\nDon, your Ethernet usage is amazing.\n\n1242\n00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,530\nIt is kinda high, isn't it?\n\n1243\n00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,795\nThat's pretty hefty there.\n\n1244\n00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:22,970\n[LAUGH].\nWell, now,\n\n1245\n00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,781\nremember that we do have a scale\nto worry about here, right?\n\n1246\n00:57:26,781 --> 00:57:27,440\nOh, yeah, that's right.\n\n1247\n00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,040\nSo I'm on a gigabit adapter.\n\n1248\n00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,600\nAnd the scale is to 54 megabit.\n\n1249\n00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,350\nOh, that's true.\n\n1250\n00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,770\nBut, you know, the fact that\nI am consuming, it, you know.\n\n1251\n00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:36,784\nI'm running my screen sharing software,\nso.\n\n1252\n00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:38,144\nRight, and that's the one that eats up.\n\n1253\n00:57:38,144 --> 00:57:41,382\nSo apparently my screen sharing software\nruns at about 40 megabit per second and.\n\n1254\n00:57:41,382 --> 00:57:43,026\n[LAUGH].\n\n1255\n00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,400\nYeah, I think that's really\nthe only thing I'm running.\n\n1256\n00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,020\nYeah.\n\n1257\n00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:47,240\nWell, anyhow.\n\n1258\n00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,175\nSo, yeah.\n\n1259\n00:57:48,175 --> 00:57:52,375\nSo we start to get a vision of that, and\nthat's actually a great example, Ronnie,\n\n1260\n00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:55,510\nthat I know I'm eating 40 megabit,\nbut what program is it?\n\n1261\n00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,320\nHow do I know which program\nis consuming that bandwidth?\n\n1262\n00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,320\nYou don't from this screen.\n\n1263\n00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,040\nNope, but, yep.\n\n1264\n00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,966\nI go back here, sort by Network.\n\n1265\n00:58:06,055 --> 00:58:07,212\n[CROSSTALK] And I sort by network.\n\n1266\n00:58:07,212 --> 00:58:08,025\nThis one conveniently doesn't tell me.\n\n1267\n00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:09,074\n[LAUGH].\n\n1268\n00:58:09,074 --> 00:58:09,750\n[LAUGH].\n\n1269\n00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:13,216\nBut actually, this is what we used to\nactually troubleshoot this before, right?\n\n1270\n00:58:13,216 --> 00:58:13,890\nMm-hm.\n\n1271\n00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,270\nWe went into Task Manager.\n\n1272\n00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:19,010\nWe were wondering what in the world was\neating up all of our bandwidth when we\n\n1273\n00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,950\nwere sharing our desktops,\ncuz we were having a few issues here.\n\n1274\n00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,000\nAnd then we actually\nfound out that it was our\n\n1275\n00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,310\nscreen sharing software that was actually\nconsuming about the 40 megabits here.\n\n1276\n00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:34,000\nAnd, ironically, it didn't show\nup this time, I don't know why.\n\n1277\n00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,540\nWell, I wonder, let's see if my screen\nsharing software even shows up in here.\n\n1278\n00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,760\nThis is something I bump into a good bit,\n\n1279\n00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,390\nis that this view of processes is\nsometimes filtered a little bit.\n\n1280\n00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:46,729\nAnd well, no, there it is,\nthere's our screen sharing software, and\n\n1281\n00:58:46,729 --> 00:58:48,056\nit is showing zero megabit.\n\n1282\n00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:51,930\nThe one thing you don't know is,\nI've got more than one network adapter.\n\n1283\n00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:52,516\nThat's true.\nAnd so\n\n1284\n00:58:52,516 --> 00:58:55,067\nthis column may be queuing\noff of my wireless adapter.\n\n1285\n00:58:55,067 --> 00:58:57,430\nBut I'm running over\nthe wired one over here.\n\n1286\n00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,517\nSo that can happen, and\nif that's the case,\n\n1287\n00:59:00,517 --> 00:59:03,287\nI don't think it lets me change it here.\n\n1288\n00:59:03,287 --> 00:59:03,877\nYeah.\n\n1289\n00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:07,180\nNo, but we can go under Details and\nmanipulate it.\n\n1290\n00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:11,030\nOr in this case, I'd probably have to\ngo into the Performance Monitor and\n\n1291\n00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,297\ndial it in there.\n\n1292\n00:59:12,297 --> 00:59:15,130\nBut I'll bet it's queued off\nof that wrong network adapter.\n\n1293\n00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:15,680\nThat's gotta be it.\n\n1294\n00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,590\nAll right, but\nyou'll see there's other things in here.\n\n1295\n00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:23,720\nYou can see which users are consuming\nCPU and network and so on.\n\n1296\n00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,120\nYou can see other things like\nyour application history.\n\n1297\n00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,140\nSo historically, who's generated\nthe most traffic or tile updates.\n\n1298\n00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,050\nThis is my Modern UI apps.\n\n1299\n00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,710\nDragon Hunter 4 is creeping up there.\n\n1300\n00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,240\nThat's right.\n\n1301\n00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,730\nDon. [LAUGH]. Flat zeros, I don't think\nI have ever even installed that, so.\n\n1302\n00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:42,647\nBut Fruit Ninja, though.\n\n1303\n00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:44,400\nBut it's on, now, Fruit Ninja, I know.\n\n1304\n00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,068\n[LAUGH].\n\n1305\n00:59:45,068 --> 00:59:47,870\nMy son's logged some time, which is\nconveniently logged in here as zero also.\n\n1306\n00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,690\nSo not the most accurate results today.\n\n1307\n00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,550\nPlex, I've definitely used Plex.\n\n1308\n00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:52,260\nYeah.\nAll right,\n\n1309\n00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,800\nso you can get that information.\n\n1310\n00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,300\nAgain, this is all in real time.\n\n1311\n00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,640\nThis isn't being saved anywhere.\n\n1312\n00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,580\nSo we don't have historical data,\nwhich I guess would explain that.\n\n1313\n00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:04,448\nSo, I haven't run Dungeon Hunter 4 or\nwhatever since this computer rebooted,\n\n1314\n01:00:04,448 --> 01:00:07,440\nbut I have run Plex, so\nthey show up in there.\n\n1315\n01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,410\nYeah.\n\n1316\n01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:09,390\nAll right.\n\n1317\n01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:13,400\nSo, good information, useful for\nreal time stuff, not useful for\n\n1318\n01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,460\nhistorical reporting.\n\n1319\n01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,600\nRight.\n\n1320\n01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,480\nAll right.\n\n1321\n01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,440\nWell, we've pretty much run\nout of time on this segment.\n\n1322\n01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,220\nRonnie, you have anything\nelse to throw in on this one?\n\n1323\n01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,490\nNope, I think we're ready for\nwhen we get back on the.\n\n1324\n01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,740\nYep, we got DaRT still on our table.\n\n1325\n01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,110\nSo we've got some more advanced\ntroubleshooting utilities to use.\n\n1326\n01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,860\nWe're gonna take a look at how to\ndeal with those crash dump files, and\n\n1327\n01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,270\nsome of that good stuff there,\nso stay tuned.\n\n1328\n01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,192\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n1329\n01:00:34,192 --> 01:00:40,734\n[MUSIC].\n\n1330\n01:00:42,136 --> 01:00:43,970\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n1331\n01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,970\nSo in our last two segments, we've taken a\nlook at several troubleshooting utilities,\n\n1332\n01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,680\nand when they're appropriate,\nand when we can use them.\n\n1333\n01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,340\nAnd we made a reference at\nthe beginning of the show to the crash\n\n1334\n01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,420\nmemory dumps that happen when we\nget a blue screen on our system.\n\n1335\n01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,673\nAnd those crash memory dumps,\nfor the most part,\n\n1336\n01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:02,936\nare not something that's\nterribly useful to us.\n\n1337\n01:01:02,936 --> 01:01:07,783\nBut Microsoft does have a special,\nsuper secret, double-probation utility\n\n1338\n01:01:07,783 --> 01:01:12,020\navailable that allows us to get some\ninsight into those crash dumps.\n\n1339\n01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:16,330\nAnd not only that, but\nto get all sorts of other recovery tools.\n\n1340\n01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:20,662\nAnd this is all part of what's\ncalled the DaRT, or Disaster and\n\n1341\n01:01:20,662 --> 01:01:23,130\nRecovery Toolkit from Microsoft.\n\n1342\n01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:23,698\nYeah.\n\n1343\n01:01:23,698 --> 01:01:26,250\nThe Disaster and\nRecovery Toolkit for us, though,\n\n1344\n01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:30,110\nit doesn't magically appear in the way\nthat we would normally need it, okay.\n\n1345\n01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,970\nSo it's kind of an unusual tool for\n\n1346\n01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:35,160\nus, in the very fact that you have\nto build this particular tool.\n\n1347\n01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,350\nSo a lot of times what you have to do of\ncourse is get all of those tools lined up,\n\n1348\n01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,650\nin other words,\nthe prerequisites lined up first.\n\n1349\n01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:44,790\nAnd then once you get all\nthat actually installed and\n\n1350\n01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:49,050\ndoing what you need to, then you can build\nwhat we call a disaster recovery media.\n\n1351\n01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:53,037\nNow, Microsoft and Windows 8.1,\na lot of times before this,\n\n1352\n01:01:53,037 --> 01:01:57,673\nwe only had the idea of an ISO or then a\nDVD, or usually a DVD and the size of it,\n\n1353\n01:01:57,673 --> 01:02:01,806\nthat you would actually be able to\nburn and then you could take that to\n\n1354\n01:02:01,806 --> 01:02:06,800\nany particular computer that had a DVD\ndrive in it, and load it right up.\n\n1355\n01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,580\nBut Microsoft, over time,\nhas actually said, look,\n\n1356\n01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,930\nwe can actually include\nthis in the images today.\n\n1357\n01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:13,910\nIf we want to,\nto put it on thumb drives as well, and\n\n1358\n01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,730\nthat way you don't have to\nworry about just having a DVD.\n\n1359\n01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:19,990\nAnd you can even load it up directly.\n\n1360\n01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,500\nLike we said,\nif you already have a recovery partition,\n\n1361\n01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,920\nyou can actually replace that one and\nactually put this in its place instead.\n\n1362\n01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,950\nSo I mean, there's a lot of\ndifferent features for us here.\n\n1363\n01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:29,970\nYeah, the DaRT,\n\n1364\n01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,980\nit originally started out as just\na bootable CD like Ronnie was saying.\n\n1365\n01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,557\nAnd it just had a bunch of tools, a bunch\nof utilities on there that were there to\n\n1366\n01:02:36,557 --> 01:02:38,633\nhelp you fix a machine\nthat no longer worked.\n\n1367\n01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:41,940\nThat wouldn't boot up, that was\nblue-screening, that had whatever issues.\n\n1368\n01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,050\nYou had this CD packed full of utilities.\n\n1369\n01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:46,260\nAnd over the years,\nthey've added more and more to it.\n\n1370\n01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,150\nAnd they keep updating it so\nthere's different versions of the DaRT.\n\n1371\n01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:50,920\nAnd they normally correspond with the OS.\n\n1372\n01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,760\nSo, like, right now, there's the DaRT for\nWindows 8 and DaRT for Windows 8.1.\n\n1373\n01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,225\nIt is that specific.\n\n1374\n01:02:56,225 --> 01:02:57,900\nSo there's different ones\nthat are available, and\n\n1375\n01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,087\nyou need to get the appropriate one.\n\n1376\n01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:01,486\nNow, Ronnie mentioned,\nit doesn't just magically appear.\n\n1377\n01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,850\nRight [LAUGH].\nSo, let's talk a little bit about that.\n\n1378\n01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:07,327\nFirst off, in order to get\nthe disaster recovery toolkit,\n\n1379\n01:03:07,327 --> 01:03:09,274\nit's not a standalone product,\n\n1380\n01:03:09,274 --> 01:03:14,365\nit's a part of what's called the Microsoft\nDesktop Optimization Pack, or the MDOP.\n\n1381\n01:03:14,365 --> 01:03:20,210\nAnd the MDOP is only available to\nenterprise customers of Microsoft.\n\n1382\n01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:24,090\nIf you have a volume license agreement\nwith Microsoft, you get this for free.\n\n1383\n01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:26,800\nIf you don't have a volume\nlicense agreement with Microsoft,\n\n1384\n01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,120\nyou don't get this tool, period.\n\n1385\n01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,430\nThat's it.\nThey don't sell it,\n\n1386\n01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,600\nyou can't buy it on their website,\nit's not free.\n\n1387\n01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,020\nIt's part of, well, it's sort of free.\n\n1388\n01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,990\nAfter you pay them a ton of money,\nyou get it for free, right.\n\n1389\n01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,840\nSo that's how it works if\nyou're an enterprise customer.\n\n1390\n01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,297\nSo if you're an enterprise,\na big business, if you've got thousands of\n\n1391\n01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:47,035\nMicrosoft machines, if you're a school\nboard or government, you likely have\n\n1392\n01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:50,972\nan enterprise agreement with Microsoft,\nand the MDOP is free for you, all right.\n\n1393\n01:03:50,972 --> 01:03:56,788\nIf you are like ITProTV where we have\na handful of licenses to suit our staff.\n\n1394\n01:03:56,788 --> 01:03:58,633\nBut not enough to do\nan enterprise agreement,\n\n1395\n01:03:58,633 --> 01:03:59,968\nit becomes not available for us.\n\n1396\n01:03:59,968 --> 01:04:00,805\nYeah.\n\n1397\n01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:01,687\nNow, I'm a Microsoft trainer.\n\n1398\n01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:02,315\nI get it.\n\n1399\n01:04:02,315 --> 01:04:02,890\nYou are, too, Ronnie.\nYep.\n\n1400\n01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:06,691\nSo we get it through our trainer status,\nbut for your average small and\n\n1401\n01:04:06,691 --> 01:04:10,860\nmedium company, this is not\na tool that's available for them.\n\n1402\n01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,184\nYeah.\nBut let's say that you are an EA customer,\n\n1403\n01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:17,290\nyou know, an Enterprise Agreement\ncustomer, and you've got that license.\n\n1404\n01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,470\nSo you log into your\nEnterprise account and\n\n1405\n01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:22,415\nyou download the Microsoft desktop\noptimization pack, the MDOP.\n\n1406\n01:04:22,415 --> 01:04:23,140\nMm-hm.\n\n1407\n01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:27,890\nAnd when you install it,\nit will install the DaRT Builder, right?\n\n1408\n01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:29,140\nYeah.\nThat's basically what it's called.\n\n1409\n01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,630\nImage show, yep.\n\n1410\n01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,400\nAnd you run the DaRT image tool, and\nit's basically gonna ask you for\n\n1411\n01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,850\na few things, all right?\n\n1412\n01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:36,800\nThe DaRT depends on three things.\n\n1413\n01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,630\nYou need one,\na Windows 8.1 DVD, all right.\n\n1414\n01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,095\nYeah.\nISO or DVD, it doesn't matter, but\n\n1415\n01:04:42,095 --> 01:04:45,390\nyou need a disc, an actual Windows\n8.1 operating system disc.\n\n1416\n01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:49,030\nTwo, you need an, you see, I've got my\nlittle notes here so I don't screw it up.\n\n1417\n01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:51,160\nYeah.\nYou need the Assessment and\n\n1418\n01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,410\nDeployment Toolkit.\n\n1419\n01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,780\nNow the ADK, Assessment and\nDeployment Toolkit, is free.\n\n1420\n01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,650\nYou can download it right\nfrom Microsoft's website.\n\n1421\n01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:00,370\nSo, you've got to go and download that,\nthat's available to everybody.\n\n1422\n01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:05,040\nAnd then you need the Software Development\nKit, the SDK, which also is free and\n\n1423\n01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:05,710\navailable to anybody.\n\n1424\n01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,540\nYou need to download that from Microsoft.\n\n1425\n01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:11,600\nIf you want the crash dump analyzer,\nthat's an important piece, okay.\n\n1426\n01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,130\nWhen you have all that together, right?\n\n1427\n01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,930\nSo, let's run through those again.\n\n1428\n01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:18,240\nNumber one, you have to spend tons\nof money with Microsoft, right?\n\n1429\n01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:18,830\nEA agreement.\n\n1430\n01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:20,330\nSo there, there's requirement one.\n\n1431\n01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:23,030\nRequirement number two, the ADK.\n\n1432\n01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,426\nRequirement number three, the SDK,\nand requirement number four,\n\n1433\n01:05:27,426 --> 01:05:28,881\na Windows 8.1 DVD.\n\n1434\n01:05:28,881 --> 01:05:30,660\nYep.\nThen, you mix them all together.\n\n1435\n01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:31,500\n[LAUGH] Right.\n\n1436\n01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,570\nYeah, once you mix them all together,\n\n1437\n01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:35,860\nyou'll see that there is\na wizard that walks you through.\n\n1438\n01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,870\nAnd in the end,\nyou can either, like we said,\n\n1439\n01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:43,150\ninstall it onto a partition somewhere,\nor go ahead and make a DVD out of it.\n\n1440\n01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,185\nWell and\nwhat we did is we made an ISO out of ours.\n\n1441\n01:05:45,185 --> 01:05:47,000\nMm-hm.\nTo actually be able to do.\n\n1442\n01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,700\nNow the cool thing about it is everything\nis pretty much contained if you\n\n1443\n01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,380\nactually do the idea of the ISO.\n\n1444\n01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,260\nSo all the tools that you need\nif your computer can't restart,\n\n1445\n01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:58,210\nyou can go ahead and load that up here,\nand then you can boot directly to it, and\n\n1446\n01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:01,980\nthen get access to a whole bunch of tools,\njust like we said.\n\n1447\n01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,580\nYeah, and the idea is,\nif you're a network admin or, you know,\n\n1448\n01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:08,140\na support engineer, whatever, and you get\ncalled to come look at a desktop, and\n\n1449\n01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,020\nthe desktop won't even boot.\n\n1450\n01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,250\nYeah.\nHow do you troubleshoot it?\n\n1451\n01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,880\nYou can't get into the operating system.\n\n1452\n01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,060\nSo you have this CD or\nthis USB key that you carry with you.\n\n1453\n01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:18,150\nPlug it right into the system,\nboot off of that, and\n\n1454\n01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:21,070\nthen begin to troubleshoot and\ndiagnose the system, all right?\n\n1455\n01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,870\nSo Ronnie,\nwhy don't you give us a tour here?\n\n1456\n01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,980\nRonnie's got a machine fired up over\nhere that's already running the DaRT.\n\n1457\n01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:26,640\nYep.\n\n1458\n01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,750\nSo what I've got on my\nparticular machine here,\n\n1459\n01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,920\nof course,\nis that I've put the DaRT DVD in.\n\n1460\n01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,590\nI've rebooted it, and normally,\n\n1461\n01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,460\nit actually asks if you want to create\nnetwork connections in the background.\n\n1462\n01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,740\nSo, in other words, it can actually\nload network drivers in the background\n\n1463\n01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,950\non your machine as it does it.\n\n1464\n01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:45,680\nBut then, the next step, of course, Is to\nchoose your particular keyboard layout.\n\n1465\n01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,670\nNow, I'm zoomed in a little bit\nto make sure that we can actually\n\n1466\n01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,110\nsee these selections here.\n\n1467\n01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:53,300\nSo I went ahead, and go ahead, I'm going\nto choose the US keyboard layout here.\n\n1468\n01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:57,410\nAnd now, I have these three options\nthat we have available for us, right?\n\n1469\n01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:58,910\nI can continue to Windows 8.1,\n\n1470\n01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:02,295\nwhich is probably not what I need to do\nif I'm not able to get access into it.\n\n1471\n01:07:02,295 --> 01:07:04,270\n[LAUGH] I can just turn the PC off.\n\n1472\n01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,610\nThat's always a possible solution,\nbut usually for us,\n\n1473\n01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:11,730\nwe're gonna go into the troubleshooting,\nis what we're gonna do here to be able\n\n1474\n01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:15,910\nto reset or refresh the PC or\nuse the advanced tools, okay?\n\n1475\n01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:19,410\nSo for us, even though the reset and\nthe refresh are options for\n\n1476\n01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,110\nus, we're really a lot of times\nin terms of troubleshooting.\n\n1477\n01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,270\nWe want to do the minimum possible.\n\n1478\n01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:25,860\nIn other words,\nwe don't want to affect the system so\n\n1479\n01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,270\nmuch that it seems\ndifferent to the end user.\n\n1480\n01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:30,058\nWe want to actually just\nbring up what we need to.\n\n1481\n01:07:30,058 --> 01:07:33,490\nSo I'm gonna click on\nthe troubleshooting here, and\n\n1482\n01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:37,160\nnow notice there's the two main options\nthat they want you to have there.\n\n1483\n01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,780\nThe reset and refresh here.\n\n1484\n01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:42,690\nThere's other advanced options,\nbut the one that we're looking for\n\n1485\n01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:44,030\nis right here, okay?\n\n1486\n01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,610\nThe Microsoft diagnostic and\nrecovery tool set.\n\n1487\n01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:47,230\nOkay?\n\n1488\n01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:52,440\nSo this is off of that ISO or\noff of that DVD that we just put in here,\n\n1489\n01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,810\nand it now gives me access\nto a whole set of tools.\n\n1490\n01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:59,410\nNow if I select that one, it's gonna ask\nme for what particular operating system.\n\n1491\n01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,900\nSo, you can build the DaRT, and it can\n\n1492\n01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,790\nessentially support multiple operating\nsystems, but here, I only got one.\n\n1493\n01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,709\nWell this is really,\nif somebody is dual booting.\n\n1494\n01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,064\nRight.\nIf they got more than one OS,\n\n1495\n01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:10,900\nyou'll see more than one on the list.\n\n1496\n01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,510\nMost people aren't gonna have that though,\nso you'll normally just see that one.\n\n1497\n01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,290\nSo that's cool.\n\n1498\n01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,330\nYep.\n\n1499\n01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,040\nSo there it is.\n\n1500\n01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,500\nI launch into it and there they are.\n\n1501\n01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,960\nThere's a ton of different tools that\nare actually available right here for\n\n1502\n01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,990\nus, and there's actually some neat things\nwhen you build this as well, okay?\n\n1503\n01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,380\nSo like the Windows defender.\n\n1504\n01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,490\nWhen you actually first build it,\neven though this may actually be six or\n\n1505\n01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:35,290\nseven months old from what I know, it did.\n\n1506\n01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:39,070\nIt asked me, when I first built it, if I\nwanted to update the Windows Defender.\n\n1507\n01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:39,780\nEven right here.\n\n1508\n01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,780\nDownload the latest definitions.\n\n1509\n01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:42,110\nYeah, download the latest definitions.\n\n1510\n01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:42,800\nSo I mean, even right then,\n\n1511\n01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,930\nif you actually decide you're gonna build\na new one, you can go ahead and do that.\n\n1512\n01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,600\nAnd I've noticed that you can go ahead and\nscan for things like malware.\n\n1513\n01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,290\nSo if you are affected by a rootkit or\nsomething else is here,\n\n1514\n01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:56,940\nthey even give you that particular utility\nto do something just that simple as well.\n\n1515\n01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,735\nNotice you have access to, again, other\nthings that you might find helpful, and\n\n1516\n01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:04,400\nthis was something that is actually new,\nI think in 8.1 here.\n\n1517\n01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,060\nBeing able to set up remote connections\ndirectly into DaRT as well.\n\n1518\n01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:12,570\nAnd so here's actually a neat one where,\nfor me, if I only had a DVD and\n\n1519\n01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:15,190\nI launched into it,\nI could make a remote connection.\n\n1520\n01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,030\nSo let's say that I put it in, but\n\n1521\n01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:19,430\nI really needed Don to take\na look at it at this point.\n\n1522\n01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,486\nWell, if Don was in another\noffice somewhere, in theory,\n\n1523\n01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:25,543\nthis can actually help it set up,\nand Don could actually use\n\n1524\n01:09:25,543 --> 01:09:29,517\nthe remote desktop to connect right in\nhere, and to be able to take this over,\n\n1525\n01:09:29,517 --> 01:09:33,470\nif the network connections are also up for\nus as well, okay?\n\n1526\n01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:36,998\nNow, there are some tools that they\nhave added in over time, and so\n\n1527\n01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:39,707\nsome of the new ones that\nare fairly specific here.\n\n1528\n01:09:39,707 --> 01:09:42,261\nNotice that up here in\nthe upper right-hand corner,\n\n1529\n01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,030\nleft-hand corner, sorry.\n\n1530\n01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:46,090\nI can't tell my directions here.\n\n1531\n01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,710\nThere is a Locksmith now, okay?\n\n1532\n01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:51,335\nSo for those that have ever\nbeen locked out of a computer,\n\n1533\n01:09:51,335 --> 01:09:54,130\nokay, because someone left and\n\n1534\n01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:58,870\nthe password had changed, it gives you\nthe ability here to reset a local account\n\n1535\n01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:03,630\npassword if you need to right here by\nrunning this Locksmith wizard as well.\n\n1536\n01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:09,920\nSo I mean, there's a lot of features built\nright in this incredible utility here.\n\n1537\n01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:17,010\nYou can repair your hard drives here,\nthe volumes on MBR, and everything.\n\n1538\n01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,350\nYou can even erase the disc.\n\n1539\n01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:20,910\nNotice that hot fixes, right?\n\n1540\n01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:23,950\nWhat if we actually install a hot fix,\nand all of a sudden, there it is.\n\n1541\n01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,880\nYou can't get back into it, or\nyou believe that's a problem and\n\n1542\n01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,140\nit's not letting you back in.\n\n1543\n01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,600\nIt crashed the machine.\n\n1544\n01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,520\nOnce again,\nyou can uninstall a lot of things.\n\n1545\n01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,540\nThere's even kind of this neat little\ntool, especially for, let's say,\n\n1546\n01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,680\nnovices, right?\n\n1547\n01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,220\nNotice the solution wizard here.\n\n1548\n01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,370\nThis is kind of a neat one\nthat was very interesting.\n\n1549\n01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,200\nNot sure which tool to use?\n\n1550\n01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,570\nYou can walk through, and now you can\nactually select which of the following\n\n1551\n01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:52,730\nthat you think, hey,\nI don't know which one of these to use.\n\n1552\n01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:55,600\nAnd here again, it kind of whittles\nit down, and then in the end,\n\n1553\n01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,496\nit will give you a suggestion of\nwhat you can do as well, okay?\n\n1554\n01:10:58,496 --> 01:11:01,762\nSo I don't need to run through that,\nwell maybe.\n\n1555\n01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:04,590\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1556\n01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:09,190\nAnd SFC, the system file scanner,\ntons of tools.\n\n1557\n01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:12,790\nThe ability to browse\nthe entire hard drive again.\n\n1558\n01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,640\nAll the way to computer management,\nyou name it.\n\n1559\n01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,120\nThere's a ton of tools here, but the one\nthat really, I guess, would be the tool\n\n1560\n01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,790\nthat we're looking for, is what, is this\ncrash analyzer one that we have, okay?\n\n1561\n01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:29,640\nSo remember that when your systems, right,\ndo end up crashing, you get that blue\n\n1562\n01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:34,480\nscreen error, that stop error, it's\ngoing to generate that memory.dmp file.\n\n1563\n01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,425\nAnd normally it stays inside\nof your Windows folder.\n\n1564\n01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:40,960\nYeah, your system root folder\nis where it normally saves it.\n\n1565\n01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,580\nAnd from there though,\n\n1566\n01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:46,570\nonce that's actually saved,\nthen you can use this crash test analyzer\n\n1567\n01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:49,410\nto actually take a look at what\nthat information is generating.\n\n1568\n01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:52,241\nYeah, normally that memory.dmp file\nis pretty useless to us, right?\n\n1569\n01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:55,450\nI mean, it could be pretty big,\nit could be the same size as your RAM, so\n\n1570\n01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:58,300\nif you have 16 gigs of RAM,\nit could be up to 16 gigs is size.\n\n1571\n01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,694\nIt's not normally that big.\n\n1572\n01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:03,696\nWhen a crash occurs, Windows will try and\ngrab the memory space that was involved in\n\n1573\n01:12:03,696 --> 01:12:05,881\nthe crash, and so\nnormally it's not so big.\n\n1574\n01:12:05,881 --> 01:12:10,880\nI happened to crash my computer yesterday\njust through the course of being me and so\n\n1575\n01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,100\nwe grabbed that memory dump.\n\n1576\n01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,220\nAnd my memory dump, that machine that\nI was on had eight gigs of RAM, but\n\n1577\n01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:19,410\nthe memory dump was only 550 megs,\nso it wasn't that big.\n\n1578\n01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:22,040\nBut when you get those memory dumps,\nthey're not terribly helpful,\n\n1579\n01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,350\nas a regular engines,\nthey don't mean anything to you.\n\n1580\n01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:28,715\nBut with the Microsoft DaRT, you can\nactually open that cache dump file and\n\n1581\n01:12:28,715 --> 01:12:31,240\nit will extrapolate\nthe information from it.\n\n1582\n01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,165\nWhat applications and dlls revolve and\nall that kind of stuff and so\n\n1583\n01:12:34,165 --> 01:12:35,425\nwe can start to decipher.\n\n1584\n01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:38,775\nNow I'm not saying this is going to be\neasy, right it's still designed for\n\n1585\n01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:40,850\nsomebody with a very\nhigh technical knowledge.\n\n1586\n01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:44,640\nSo it's something you learn over time, how\nto interpret the data and make use of it.\n\n1587\n01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,660\nBut it's this crash analyzer that let's us\ndo that, at least let's us do it easily.\n\n1588\n01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,330\nNow here on the end result of this,\n\n1589\n01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:55,120\na lot of times it actually even points out\nthe specific DLL that may be involved, so\n\n1590\n01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,270\nat least that way you might\nactually know what's going on.\n\n1591\n01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:02,630\nYou may not know how to fix it, but\nat least which one's actually involved.\n\n1592\n01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:03,520\nAre we ready to take a look?\n\n1593\n01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,980\nSure, fire it up.\n\n1594\n01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,740\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at the crash analyzer.\n\n1595\n01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:10,950\nOnce again, a nice wizard of course, walks\nus through here to analyze a crash dump.\n\n1596\n01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:14,400\nTo identify the driver that\ncaused the system to fail here.\n\n1597\n01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,810\nAnd then we can click Next.\n\n1598\n01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:20,640\nAnd now it's asking,\nit's looking for a specific folder or\n\n1599\n01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,810\npath inside of our DaRT\nrecovery tool set here.\n\n1600\n01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:27,690\nNow there's a couple of ways you can do\nthis, but it's best if you actually do it\n\n1601\n01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:32,700\nwhen it's actually built into the actual\nDaRT recovery CD or DVD there.\n\n1602\n01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:37,060\nSo that's gonna be the X drive, and\nthen- Yeah, and I made this disk before\n\n1603\n01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:41,190\nthe show, and I just made sure to put\nthese in there with the disk at that time.\n\n1604\n01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,740\nThat is the best way,\ncuz it's all in one place.\n\n1605\n01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,400\nI did it earlier and\nI put it on the actual computer itself.\n\n1606\n01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,320\nAnd so yeah, that was my fault.\n\n1607\n01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,790\nGo ahead and click OK, and\nthen click Next, and from here,\n\n1608\n01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:54,110\nit's asking for symbols here.\n\n1609\n01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:56,600\nNow Don, I'm not really sure about\nwhat these symbols are, what?\n\n1610\n01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:02,450\nAll right, so when you run Windows, all of\nyour DLLs and your Dynamic Link Libraries.\n\n1611\n01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:05,790\nThey're heavily optimized\nto run as fast as possible.\n\n1612\n01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:08,260\nBut internally,\nthe Microsoft Development Team,\n\n1613\n01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:13,150\nthey make special DLLs with\ndebugging hooks and symbols in them.\n\n1614\n01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:16,790\nThey do extra reporting,\nextra messages to the operating system.\n\n1615\n01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,060\nSo if you say, hey what is 2 plus 2,\n\n1616\n01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,890\nthe optimized DLL might\njust reply back and say 4.\n\n1617\n01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:27,700\nBut if you've got symbols and debug hooks\nenabled, that DLL wouldn't just respond 4,\n\n1618\n01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:33,770\nit would say your answer is 4, and\nthat took me 0.57 nanoseconds to run and\n\n1619\n01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:36,970\nI referenced this memory and\nall this extra stuff.\n\n1620\n01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:40,540\nAnd that extra stuff is great for\ntroubleshooting, but it kills you for\n\n1621\n01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,240\nperformance.\n\n1622\n01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,950\nIt makes things run slow.\n\n1623\n01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:45,610\nSo Windows doesn't have those by default.\n\n1624\n01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:49,460\nIf you wanna use them, you can download\nthem from Microsoft's website or\n\n1625\n01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,620\nwith the SDK or wherever,\nand load them in.\n\n1626\n01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,120\nSo that's what it's saying right here.\n\n1627\n01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,370\nIf we download symbol files where\nare we gonna download them to?\n\n1628\n01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:57,800\nAnd so we're just saying C:/symbols.\n\n1629\n01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,960\nAnd see how its got delete symbol\nfiles when analysis is complete You\n\n1630\n01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,300\ndon't need 'em hanging around.\n\n1631\n01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,980\nAnd so when you're done it\ncan just wipe them out.\n\n1632\n01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:07,320\nAnd it will actually reach\nout to Windows update.\n\n1633\n01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,130\nYou don't have to have\nan Internet connection.\n\n1634\n01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,500\nIf you don't, you just can't do this.\n\n1635\n01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,430\nBut if you do have an internet connection,\nit'll go out and download.\n\n1636\n01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:17,710\nYep.\nAll right, so we'll do that.\n\n1637\n01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,770\nAnd then we can go ahead and\nclick Next here.\n\n1638\n01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,280\nIf I can click Next.\n\n1639\n01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,140\nAnd now it's reaching out to actually\ngrab that memory dump file for us.\n\n1640\n01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,410\nNow I actually created another one for\nus here as well.\n\n1641\n01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:32,670\nLet me go ahead and click browse and\ngrab the one that Don's talking about,\n\n1642\n01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:34,790\nbecause his had more\ninteresting stuff in it.\n\n1643\n01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:37,160\nMine's a legitimate crash\nnot a staged crash.\n\n1644\n01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,615\nYeah mine was a staged one here.\n\n1645\n01:15:38,615 --> 01:15:39,150\n[LAUGH].\n\n1646\n01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:42,610\nSo I'm going inside of\nthe Windows folder as you see.\n\n1647\n01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:45,480\nAnd I renamed because I didn't know it\nwould overwrite his I didn't want to\n\n1648\n01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,540\noverwrite his.\n\n1649\n01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,600\nI called it memorydump1,\nyou know I'm real creative.\n\n1650\n01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,740\nThat's the one from mine?\n\n1651\n01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,048\nYeah, [CROSSTALK] That's\nthe one from yours yep.\n\n1652\n01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:55,700\nAnd so I'm gonna select that one and\nclick Next.\n\n1653\n01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:59,220\nAnd now it's actually\nlaunching the analysis here.\n\n1654\n01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,470\nIt's going through and it's taking\nall those whatever the symbols are,\n\n1655\n01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:03,570\nwhatever it is here.\n\n1656\n01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:07,560\nAnd it's taken analysis of this,\nand the nice thing is, even as for\n\n1657\n01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,340\nsomeone not as skilled\nin terms of doing this,\n\n1658\n01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:13,870\nit will essentially give you\na summary report at this front here.\n\n1659\n01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:16,000\nBut notice that there's\nthis details button,\n\n1660\n01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,820\nthat we'll be able to click on as well.\n\n1661\n01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:21,540\nYeah, and\njust remember if you're a programmer,\n\n1662\n01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,800\nthen a lot of this stuff is\ngonna make a lot more sense.\n\n1663\n01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,970\nBut even as an administrator,\nwe get some basic information.\n\n1664\n01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:30,470\nSo here we can see immediately that my\nproblem centered around this one DLL,\n\n1665\n01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:32,849\nwhich was the CD-ROM driver.\n\n1666\n01:16:32,849 --> 01:16:34,100\nYeah.\n\n1667\n01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,180\nNow, you wanna take a look in here?\n\n1668\n01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:35,980\nSure.\nAll right.\n\n1669\n01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:38,370\nHere we go.\n\n1670\n01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:40,830\nSo I got an unexpected kernel mode trap.\n\n1671\n01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:45,910\nAnd basically this resulted in a blue\nscreen and the system rebooted on me.\n\n1672\n01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:49,030\nIt basically froze while\nit did the memory dump.\n\n1673\n01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:52,070\nAnd then after it dumped it all to\nthe drive, the system rebooted and\n\n1674\n01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:56,260\nI got an on-screen message that said that\nright there, exception double fault.\n\n1675\n01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,132\nSo as I'm sitting there looking at\nthe screen, what does that mean to me?\n\n1676\n01:16:59,132 --> 01:17:00,440\nNothing.\n[LAUGH] Nothing, zero.\n\n1677\n01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:04,080\nI didn't even have any idea\nwhat it was coming from,\n\n1678\n01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,160\nwell I was able to recreate\nthe problem later.\n\n1679\n01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,330\nSo I was basically copying some\ninformation from my CD drive\n\n1680\n01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:12,350\nwhen the system blue screened and\nrebooted.\n\n1681\n01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:14,400\nSo here's some information about it.\n\n1682\n01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,800\nYep.\n\n1683\n01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,780\nSee any loaded drivers here?\n\n1684\n01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,220\nThere we go.\n\n1685\n01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,930\nAnd so we can see all the different\ndrivers that were being in use\n\n1686\n01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:22,590\nat that point.\n\n1687\n01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:25,930\nNow some of these drives may have been\nrelated to the problem, some not, right?\n\n1688\n01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:29,850\nI know it was a CD-ROM issue, so we can\nsee some of the CD-ROM drivers in there.\n\n1689\n01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,740\nIt gives us the file names and\n\n1690\n01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:36,560\nif you click on them you can even see\nthe version number down at the bottom.\n\n1691\n01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,930\nIf we're looking at one of them,\nit'll pop up down there.\n\n1692\n01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:43,230\nBut basically, as you look through here,\nthis is helping you to say,\n\n1693\n01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:46,140\nwell is there a newer version\nof this driver that's out there?\n\n1694\n01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:48,530\nIs this the appropriate driver for\nmy system?\n\n1695\n01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,480\nYou can start to isolate and\nfigure out from there.\n\n1696\n01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,915\nBut the most useful part to me is back\non that first tab, the crash message.\n\n1697\n01:17:55,915 --> 01:18:00,815\nBecause when you get that blue screen,\nit's a very, very filtered view of\n\n1698\n01:18:00,815 --> 01:18:04,375\nwhat's in there, and you don't get a lot\nof time to look at it before it reboots.\n\n1699\n01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,925\nBut here you got it on screen and\nyou can take your time and\n\n1700\n01:18:06,925 --> 01:18:10,820\nyou can read that information and\nhopefully understand it.\n\n1701\n01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:16,165\nYeah, if kv shows a task gate, use .tss\non the part before the colon, then kv.\n\n1702\n01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:19,615\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah,\nI'm not gonna to do that.\n\n1703\n01:18:19,615 --> 01:18:20,650\nI'm not gonna be able to do that.\n\n1704\n01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:24,480\nNow let's take a look at that\nadvanced tab from second ago, ready?\n\n1705\n01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,360\nIn this one is basically the full shebang.\n\n1706\n01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,340\nThe verbose troubleshooting information as\nit lays out the various things that were\n\n1707\n01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,710\ninvolved and they're showing just\nloading the symbols from Microsoft.\n\n1708\n01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:38,450\nBut as it goes,\nhere's the bugcheck analysis and\n\n1709\n01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:41,540\nit's gonna start giving us\ninformation about what's going on.\n\n1710\n01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,350\nYou can really start to break that down,\n\n1711\n01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:48,640\nfind out what was part\nof that involvement.\n\n1712\n01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:53,380\nSo if you had no clue what was involved\nin the crash, now you gotta direction.\n\n1713\n01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:56,100\nYou can say, wait a minute,\nI can see the CD-ROM was involved in this.\n\n1714\n01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,170\nSo I must have been some CD operation.\n\n1715\n01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:58,860\nWhat was I doing?\n\n1716\n01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,610\nWell, I know,\nI was copying data from the CD.\n\n1717\n01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:05,862\nWhat do I have that is in between\nmy operating system and the CD?\n\n1718\n01:19:05,862 --> 01:19:09,324\nWell, I run a little program\ncalled DVD Passkey that,\n\n1719\n01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:14,380\nI don't think you're supposed to do this,\nbut I turn off regional encoding.\n\n1720\n01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:18,670\nYou know how DVDs are printed and they'll\nhave region one, region two, region three?\n\n1721\n01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:19,732\nI hate that.\n\n1722\n01:19:19,732 --> 01:19:22,372\nAnd so, I have this little program\nthat basically disables that, so\n\n1723\n01:19:22,372 --> 01:19:24,640\nI can put whatever region\nI want in my DVD player.\n\n1724\n01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,980\nAnd, so I actually saw it up above, it\nactually referenced that little file where\n\n1725\n01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:34,230\nit's got DVDFab pop-up block, and that's\npart of the DVDFab Passkey software.\n\n1726\n01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:36,520\nAnd so, it looks like that's my issue.\n\n1727\n01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,970\nSo now, what I can do is I can go and\n\n1728\n01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:41,490\ndisable that software, and\ntry the copy operation again.\n\n1729\n01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,330\nAnd does it work or does it fail?\n\n1730\n01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:46,400\nAnd if it continues to fail,\nthen maybe that's not the problem,\n\n1731\n01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,670\nmaybe it's something else.\n\n1732\n01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:51,230\nBut if it fails, or if it doesn't fail,\nonce I remove the software,\n\n1733\n01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,830\nI know that software was the problem,\nI can go look for updates.\n\n1734\n01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,110\nThere's probably updates.\n\n1735\n01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:59,160\nWindows continually gets updated,\nso does your software.\n\n1736\n01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,110\nYeah, the nice thing about the analysis,\nit shows everything.\n\n1737\n01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:05,950\nSo even though the crash analyzer\nalready said, hey I think I've already\n\n1738\n01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:09,800\npinpointed what it is, if somebody does\nneed to take a look at what else it may be\n\n1739\n01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,280\ninteracting with,\nyou have the entire analysis right here.\n\n1740\n01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,070\nAlso the ability of course,\nto actually save it,\n\n1741\n01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:17,680\nas you see down here in\nthe lower right hand corner.\n\n1742\n01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,480\nTo be able to again save it, and\nmaybe even send it off to Microsoft.\n\n1743\n01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,000\nIf you actually called them, they may\nwant to see this memory dump file for\n\n1744\n01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,580\nus as well.\n\n1745\n01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:35,760\nSo that's basically the Microsoft DART,\nthe disaster and\n\n1746\n01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,390\nrecovery toolkit, really cool.\n\n1747\n01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:40,400\nA lot of different utilities in\nthere that are available for you.\n\n1748\n01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,190\nExtremely useful stuff.\n\n1749\n01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:44,840\nUnfortunately, not available to small,\nmedium businesses.\n\n1750\n01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,150\nIt is available to\nenterprise organizations.\n\n1751\n01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:50,810\nAnybody that has a volume license\nagreement with Microsoft.\n\n1752\n01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:51,730\nKeep that in mind.\n\n1753\n01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:55,180\nEven if you never get the chance\nto use this in real life,\n\n1754\n01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:57,540\nit is on the examm so\nwe wanna make sure that we know it.\n\n1755\n01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:01,150\nDefinitely.\nWell, Ronnie looking at the objectives,\n\n1756\n01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,550\nI think that pretty much\nwraps it up on this one.\n\n1757\n01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:05,610\nSo we've tackled each\nof different utilities.\n\n1758\n01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:11,920\nRemember in the 687 exam, 7687, they\nreally dive into the how to do this stuff.\n\n1759\n01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,420\nBut in the 688 exam, it's more of\na which tool is appropriate for\n\n1760\n01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,200\nthat solution kind of thing.\n\n1761\n01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,845\nAnd know that the DaRT is really useful\nwhen a system won't even boot up.\n\n1762\n01:21:20,845 --> 01:21:25,630\nThat if this system won't even boot up,\nthe DaRT will let you boot of a CD or\n\n1763\n01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:28,070\nUSB stick and be able to get in there and\nwork with that.\n\n1764\n01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:34,640\nWell let me just remind everybody\nif you have any questions on this,\n\n1765\n01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,170\nfeel free, well you got a couple options.\n\n1766\n01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:39,850\nLive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.TV/live.\n\n1767\n01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:42,440\nYou'll see the chat box\nright

answer.\n\n1775\n01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,570\nWhich Ronnie,\nI think you're beating me right now.\n\n1776\n01:21:58,570 --> 01:21:59,160\nYeah.\n\n1777\n01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,135\nSo I gotta get caught up.\n\n1778\n01:22:00,135 --> 01:22:03,220\n[LAUGH] But definitely take advantage\nof that resource, it is there for you.\n\n1779\n01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:03,720\nRIght.\n\n1780\n01:22:04,940
