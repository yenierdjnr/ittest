          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:05,818\n[SOUND] The 70-688 exam\n\n2\n00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:13,333\ncovers supporting Windows 8.1.\n\n3\n00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,956\nIt's the second step, and really, the,\nthe last step in obtaining your MCSA for\n\n4\n00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:18,700\nWindows 8.\n\n5\n00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,140\nNow remember the MCSA,\n\n6\n00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,550\nthat's the Microsoft Certified Solutions\nAssociate And it's designed to serve\n\n7\n00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,120\nas that, that mid level certification for\nsomebody who's going to going to be\n\n8\n00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,580\nworking with desktops in a large or\nenterprise business environment, right?\n\n9\n00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,900\nFor home users, small office,\nhome office type deployments,\n\n10\n00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,720\nthe technologies that we learn in the\nMCSA Windows 8 are usually not practical.\n\n11\n00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,250\nIt's a little bit overkill for\nsmall environments, but\n\n12\n00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,760\nif you're dealing with hundreds or\nthousands of desktops, we learn about\n\n13\n00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,800\na lot of things in the MCSA for Windows 8\nthat is very useful and very practical.\n\n14\n00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,990\nNow, keep in mind that supporting\nWindows 8.1 is the second exam.\n\n15\n00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,920\nYou should start with the first one,\nwhich is the 70-687,\n\n16\n00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,240\nand that one's gonna kind of move\nus along on the certification.\n\n17\n00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,440\nSo, let, let's take a look at\nthat track before we get too far.\n\n18\n00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,920\nThe MCSA, the Microsoft Certified\nSolutions Associate, there,\n\n19\n00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,500\nthere's actually a number of different\ntracks that are inside of there\n\n20\n00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,130\ndepending on what you want to do.\n\n21\n00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,460\nSo, for example, if you want to\nlearn about server technologies,\n\n22\n00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,870\nthey've got the MCSA for Windows Server\n2008 And Windows Server 2012.\n\n23\n00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,030\nThose focus on the server side,\nand while there is a little bit of\n\n24\n00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,880\nclient activity in there, the exams\nare really focused on the servers.\n\n25\n00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,280\nOn the desktop side, there's the MCSA for\nWindows 8 and the MCSA for Windows 7.\n\n26\n00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,260\nAnd, these again are for\nbusinesses that are being,\n\n27\n00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,980\nthat are deploying large\nquantities of Windows machines and\n\n28\n00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,570\nthey need to be able to manage,\nmaintain and support them.\n\n29\n00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,050\nNow what we're covering is the MCSA for\nWindows 8.\n\n30\n00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,188\nAnd if you dive into that,\n\n31\n00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:51,830\nyou'll see that there's basically\ntwo exams that make up that track.\n\n32\n00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,590\nThe first one is the 70-687\nthat I mentioned a moment ago.\n\n33\n00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,330\nThat's configuring Windows 8.1 and it\nfocuses on getting Windows 8 installed or\n\n34\n00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,270\ndeployed in your environment and\ngetting it up and running.\n\n35\n00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,090\nIn 688, we take that same knowledge and\n\n36\n00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,140\nnow we say how do we keep\nthings running nice and smooth?\n\n37\n00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,958\nBut its hard to keep things running\nif you didn't get them running in\n\n38\n00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:12,707\nthe first place.\n\n39\n00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,360\nSo that's why the 70-687 is first.\n\n40\n00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,385\nYou can take them out of\norder if you want, but\n\n41\n00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:21,250\nif you're learning about this,\nit doesn't make sense.\n\n42\n00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,470\nYou're taking the, the second part of\nthe exam first, but if you already have\n\n43\n00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,660\nthe knowledge it doesn't really\nmatter which order you take them in.\n\n44\n00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,510\nSo Microsoft doesn't care what\norder you do them in, but\n\n45\n00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,680\nyou typically do want\nto stay with the order.\n\n46\n00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,880\nAll right now the 688 exam is\npacked full of good information.\n\n47\n00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,500\nIt can be a little misleading though.\n\n48\n00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000\nIf we take a look at like 687,\n\n49\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,960\nand we look at its exam, it's divided\nup into seven different areas.\n\n50\n00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,910\nIf we find those down here, we'll see all\nthe different areas that are covered.\n\n51\n00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,510\nAnd they all take like 10 to 15% of\nthe exam, except for remote access and\n\n52\n00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,360\nmobility, which is 15 to 20%.\n\n53\n00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,300\nWhen we take a look at 688,\nit's a lot different.\n\n54\n00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,080\nThe 688 exam is only divided into three\nsections and each one is weighted for\n\n55\n00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,660\nabout a third of the exam.\n\n56\n00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,510\nSo it looks like a smaller exam,\nbut it is not.\n\n57\n00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,630\nEach one of these are just larger topics.\n\n58\n00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,580\nThe amount of knowledge is about the same,\nso don't underestimate it.\n\n59\n00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,810\nDon't think that this is a small and\neasy exam.\n\n60\n00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,760\nIt's actually one of the more\ndifficult exams that Microsoft has,\n\n61\n00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,050\nbecause it covers a lot of technologies\nthat people aren't familiar with.\n\n62\n00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,070\nIn Windows 8 there were a lot of new\ntroubleshooting technologies that\n\n63\n00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,720\nwere introduced.\n\n64\n00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,340\nAnd, you've gotta learn them, right?\n\n65\n00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,980\nThat's part of staying up to date.\n\n66\n00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,210\nSo if we look at each of these, the first\none is supporting operating system and\n\n67\n00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,090\napplication installation.\n\n68\n00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,210\nWell we did operating system and\ninstallation, or\n\n69\n00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,980\napplication installation, in the 70-687,\nwhy do we see this again?\n\n70\n00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,505\nWell it's supporting it,\ntroubleshooting it,\n\n71\n00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:48,255\nhandling issues that may\narise as a part of it.\n\n72\n00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:52,505\nSo this is much more of a ongoing\noperation than the original deployments we\n\n73\n00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:56,095\nsaw in the other one, and you'll see some\nof those new technologies jumping out,\n\n74\n00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:58,890\nlike user experience virtualization,\nright, UEV.\n\n75\n00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,430\nNot a lot of people have worked\nwith that because it's fairly new,\n\n76\n00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,970\nso these are some of the things that\nhave been kind of, kind of added in,\n\n77\n00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,680\nthat we've got to take the time to learn.\n\n78\n00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,730\nAnd you'll also see the Windows Store and\ncloud apps.\n\n79\n00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,520\nA lot of Internet-based technology\nis being brought into this.\n\n80\n00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,400\nSo definitely a, a different angle of, of\napproaching the same topics from 70-687.\n\n81\n00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,610\nThe second section is supporting\nresources access and so\n\n82\n00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,935\nwe start diving into some advanced things\nthat can influence sharing resources,\n\n83\n00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,195\nyou know, files, folders and printers.\n\n84\n00:04:30,195 --> 00:04:33,875\nWe'll talk about DNS security,\nways to ratchet that up, remote access,\n\n85\n00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,785\nand, and so on.\n\n86\n00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:38,980\nYou'll notice how all this is kind of\nlining up with what was in 70-687,\n\n87\n00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,960\njust going a little more advanced.\n\n88\n00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,849\nAnd then lastly we get supporting\nWindows clients and devices,\n\n89\n00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,960\nwhich is really a catch-all section.\n\n90\n00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,790\nIt goes through quite a few different\nsteps of troubleshooting and\n\n91\n00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,220\nisolating problems, and how to correct\nthem, and getting things up and going.\n\n92\n00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,130\nSo from things like, the boot manager and\nhow to analyze stop errors all the way\n\n93\n00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,440\nthrough mobile devices and\neven compliance, policy enforcement.\n\n94\n00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,740\nSo there's some really neat things there.\n\n95\n00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,480\nThis last one really starts to dabble\ninto the server side of things and\n\n96\n00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,470\nhow we can use servers to\nmanage those Windows 8 clients.\n\n97\n00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,800\nSo it really does serve as that\nbridge into Windows Server 2012.\n\n98\n00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,335\nThere is also a,\na section on Windows Intune which is a,\n\n99\n00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:28,120\na cloud based management solution that\nnot a lot of people have worked with.\n\n100\n00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,256\nWell it's on the exam.\n\n101\n00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,849\nYou need to get exposed to it and\nunderstand it, if for\n\n102\n00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:35,951\nno other reason then to determine whether\nor not it's right for your organization.\n\n103\n00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:39,580\nAll right?\nSo the 70-688, it covers a lot of stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,690\nIt is a, a big exam and\nit's a lot of new stuff for people,\n\n105\n00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,470\neven if you were certified\nunder Windows 7.\n\n106\n00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,750\nThere's just a lot of new things\nthat have been added since then.\n\n107\n00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,850\nSo it is, a bit of a challenge.\n\n108\n00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,400\nRight?\n\n109\n00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,950\nYou gotta hit the books and study hard,\n\n110\n00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,690\nand make sure you learn each of\nthe concepts that are in there.\n\n111\n00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,710\nAnd that's what our show's\ndesigned to help with.\n\n112\n00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,740\nSo in our 70-688 show, we take all of\nthose topics and we break them down into\n\n113\n00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,040\nepisodes that we can cover it and\nmake sure that you understand\n\n114\n00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,930\nthe technologies and are able to\nimplement those successfully on the exam.\n\n115\n00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,090\nNow the 70-688 exam is just like\nevery other Microsoft exam.\n\n116\n00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,140\nIt's a hundred and\nfifty dollars to take it and\n\n117\n00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,940\nyou take it at\na Pearson VUE Testing Center.\n\n118\n00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,360\nPearson VUE has centers\nall over the world, so\n\n119\n00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,680\nyou can likely find one very close to you.\n\n120\n00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,550\nYou can go to their website,\nit's www.pearsonvue.com, that's V-U-E,\n\n121\n00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,140\nand if you add a slash Microsoft to the\nend you will go right to Microsoft's page,\n\n122\n00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,620\nyou are going to locate a testing center\nnear you and sign up and take the exam.\n\n123\n00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,982\nWhen you successfully\npass both the 70-687 and\n\n124\n00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:45,160\n70-688 exam,\nyou'll be awarded the MCSA Windows 8.\n\n125\n00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,660\nIt's a great certification to have.\n\n126\n00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,850\nIt shows employers that you understand\nhow to deploy and maintain Windows 8 and,\n\n127\n00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,380\nit gets you prepared to be ready for the\nnext version of Windows that comes out.\n\n128\n00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,980\nSo when Windows 10 comes out,\n\n129\n00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,780\nyou've already learned the bulk of\nwhat's gonna be on those exams too.\n\n130\n00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,460\nSo it is a great certification.\n\n131\n00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,100\nReally kinda pushes you along\nin a general direction.\n\n132\n00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,080\nNow if you're just getting\nstarted out in IT,\n\n133\n00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,760\nthe MCSA is not really a starting\nout certification, so for you,\n\n134\n00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,770\nyou might wanna start with, CompTIA A+ if\nyou've already got computer knowledge.\n\n135\n00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,620\nIf you don't have computer knowledge\nyou might want to start with CompTIA IT\n\n136\n00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,700\nFundamentals or the Microsoft Technology\nAssociation, the MTA certification.\n\n137\n00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,100\nIn there we start with Windows\n7 at a basic level and\n\n138\n00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,870\ncover things like installations and\nbasic support.\n\n139\n00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,190\nNot very high level.\n\n140\n00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,260\nIf you've got even, even a handful\nof months of experience working with\n\n141\n00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,110\ncomputers you might find the MTA content\na little bit, I'm going to say, boring.\n\n142\n00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,670\nIt's not that it's boring, it's just\nthat you already know the content.\n\n143\n00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,210\nRight?\n\n144\n00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,092\nSo, for you, you move up,\nyou go into the MCSA.\n\n145\n00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:46,370\nAll right?\n\n146\n00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,910\nNow what many people chose to do is to\ndo the MCSA for Windows 8 as a client.\n\n147\n00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,980\nAnd then also do the MCSA for\nWindows Server.\n\n148\n00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,440\nAnd that's a great idea because\nyou get the best of both worlds.\n\n149\n00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,980\nAnd by understanding the server and\n\n150\n00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,780\nclient technologies you can integrate\nthem better in a workplace.\n\n151\n00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,690\nSo that makes you a more\nvaluable employee.\n\n152\n00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,890\nNot just to your company, but\nto your coworkers, right?\n\n153\n00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,650\nYou can.\n\n154\n00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,110\nProperly deploy solutions that\nare effective and stay running, and\n\n155\n00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,620\nthat's really the goal\nof an IT technician.\n\n156\n00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,780\nAll right, so,\nif that sounds exciting to you,\n\n157\n00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,860\nsounds like what you want to learn,\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n158\n00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,250\nStay tuned, our episodes for\n70-688 are starting here in just a moment.\n\n159\n00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,330\nif this is the wrong place for\nyou, you know, it's no big deal.\n\n160\n00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,150\nJump over to one of the other\ncertifications that I suggested.\n\n161\n00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,290\nFor the server side, you're looking for\nthe MCSA Windows Server so\n\n162\n00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,300\nthose start with the 70-410 exam so\nyou wanna go and find that show.\n\n163\n00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,890\nIf you're starting out\na little more basic than this,\n\n164\n00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,970\nthen you want to check out the CompTIA A+\nif you have some experience, or\n\n165\n00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,510\nthe CompTIA IT Fundamentals\nif you have no experience.\n\n166\n00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,850\nAnd, if you want to stick with\nMicrosoft there's the MTA,\n\n167\n00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,390\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate\nwhich again, if you have no experience,\n\n168\n00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,010\ngreat place to start.\n\n169\n00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,180\nBut if you're looking for desktops,\nthen it's MCSA Windows 8 all the way.\n\n170\n00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,829\nSo let's go ahead and get started, and,\nif I don't see you before your exam,\n\n171\n00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:02,542\ngood luck.\n\n172\n00:09:02,542 -->
