ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:15.350\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.100\nYou're watching the MCSA Windows Server\n2012 R2 show for Exam 70-410.\n\n5\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.590\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n6\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.520\nand today we're gonna jump into\nplanning for a Server installation.\n\n7\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.570\nAnd here to help us is going to\nbe of course, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.390\nCherokee, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, I'm doing great,\nhow are you today, Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.020\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n11\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.870\nNow Cherokee, as we take a look\nat this idea of planning for\n\n12\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.750\na Server installation in 2012 R2,\nwe want to make\n\n13\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.210\nsure that we understand the purpose behind\nthe planning and why this is important.\n\n14\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.520\nSo take us back a little bit when\nwe start talking about like,\n\n15\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.490\neven 2008 a little bit, and why this\nactually is different or is it different?\n\n16\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so planning is a large,\njust like any big major project,\n\n17\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.240\nyou always want to spend good amount of\ntime to make sure you're ready, but for\n\n18\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.600\nyou just a head and dive into something.\n\n19\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.000\nIt's extremely important because there are\na lot of different aspects to think about\n\n20\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.760\njust not only within network design, but\nyou also have things like licensing and\n\n21\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.560\nadditions that you need\nto consider as well.\n\n22\n00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.170\nAnd 2012 brings a lot of\nnew concepts to the table.\n\n23\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.940\nThey've done things differently\nthan Server 2008 and\n\n24\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.160\neven Server 2016 has their\nown details as well.\n\n25\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.660\nSo, it's important to\nunderstand the differences,\n\n26\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.590\nyou are expected to know that for\nthe exam.\n\n27\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590\nSo let's go ahead, and like Ronnie said,\n\n28\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.500\nlet's think about some of you may have\nalready been working with Server 2008.\n\n29\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.470\nAnd you'll notice there you had,\noriginally with the 2008 version,\n\n30\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.310\nyou had the option still to go\nwith that 32 bit or 64 bit.\n\n31\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.521\nAnd with 2008 R2,\nyou only had that 64 bit option.\n\n32\n00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:01.513\nSo 2012 kind of adopted that, and most,\nI mean we're not probably gonna be\n\n33\n00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:04.032\nregressing anytime soon\nback to those 32 bits.\n\n34\n00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:08.517\nSo that simplifies things\nin some way there.\n\n35\n00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:13.421\nSo moving forward,\nwe're not gonna be working with those 32\n\n36\n00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.120\nbit systems anymore, so that helps.\n\n37\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.405\nAnd if we look at the different\ntypes of additions,\n\n38\n00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:22.300\nso they have tried to streamline that.\n\n39\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.630\nIf we take a look at my screen,\n\n40\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.350\nwe don't see the same additions\nthat we saw in Server 2008.\n\n41\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.090\nAnd a slight difference\nhere with the name change.\n\n42\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.840\nWe'll talk about each one of our four\nmain additions here in a moment,\n\n43\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.780\nwhich in 2008 they were foundation,\nstandard, enterprise, and data centers.\n\n44\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.270\nSo the names have changed slightly.\n\n45\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.320\nI will alert you to that, but\nwe do not see our web server anymore,\n\n46\n00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.090\nour HPC, the high performance cuting,\nor our itanium based, for\n\n47\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.820\nthe itanium processors for\nthose servers as well.\n\n48\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.340\nSo, those are going to\nbe some differences,\n\n49\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.770\nbut if you think about it in\neven the most generic way.\n\n50\n00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.180\nAnd, Ronnie, I know we were talking\nabout kind of describing it as a car,\n\n51\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.770\nlike if we talk about the make being\nCadillac, the model of the car\n\n52\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.550\nis almost alikened to the version of\nthis particular operating system.\n\n53\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.593\nSo let's take a look at bits and\nthink about okay,\n\n54\n00:03:21.593 --> 00:03:26.210\nwell what's the big mack daddy,\nthe escalate here, right?\n\n55\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.660\nSo that would be your\ndata center additions.\n\n56\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.090\nSo data center additions\nis going to be designed for\n\n57\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.440\nhighly virtualized environments.\n\n58\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.910\nSo with the data center addition,\n\n59\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.828\nyou can have an unlimited amount\nof virtual instances running.\n\n60\n00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:43.080\nYou are gonna see that\nreflected in the cost, so\n\n61\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.280\nwe're talking about the most\nexpensive addition, but\n\n62\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.570\nit's going to be necessary in\na highly virtualized environment.\n\n63\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.320\nYou have up to 64 processor support\nincluding fault tolerance and\n\n64\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.880\nthe ability for hot add processors,\nwhich is pretty cool for\n\n65\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.540\nthat redundancy and that stability\nin a larger enterprise there.\n\n66\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.750\nI will note that the way you\ncan obtain your data center\n\n67\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.520\nedition is gonna be through\nMicrosoft Volume Licensing only.\n\n68\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.889\nAnd so we'll talk about licensing\nhere a few moments, but\n\n69\n00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.580\njust know that data center, virtualized\nenvironments, that's the way to go.\n\n70\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.110\nNow, if you wanna go ahead and\ntake a step down.\n\n71\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.210\nSo maybe you want all the features\nthat the data center has to offer but\n\n72\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.650\nyou don't need all those\nvirtualized instances.\n\n73\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.810\nYou may only need a few or\nmaybe more beneficial,\n\n74\n00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.770\nmaybe you only had four virtual\ninstance you wanted to run.\n\n75\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.560\nSo looking at the cost for\n\n76\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.020\nthe full blown unlimited really doesn't\nwarrant you spending that much money.\n\n77\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.180\nSo you could go ahead and take a step\ndown, and when I say step down you're not\n\n78\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.800\nlosing out on any of those great features,\nyou're just gonna be limited in\n\n79\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.560\nthe amount of instances that you have\nrunning for that particular edition.\n\n80\n00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.670\nSo with your standard edition,\nyou're gonna be limited to two per for\n\n81\n00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.685\neach license,\nit's gonna be two virtual instances.\n\n82\n00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:07.420\nSo just to clarify,\nthat's not a software limitation,\n\n83\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.580\nthat's gonna be a licensing limitation or\nyou would need to buy additional licenses.\n\n84\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nbefore we move on there and\n\n85\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.340\nyou now moved into the realm of standard.\n\n86\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.430\nWhat we were seeing earlier in the graphic\nthat you showed us is that there was\n\n87\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.400\nan enterprise edition, as well.\n\n88\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.750\nSo what happened to\nthe enterprise edition?\n\n89\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.440\n&gt;&gt; So Microsoft has a propensity to\nkind of rename things after a while.\n\n90\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.070\nSo It's kind of the same concept as\nfar as levels of versions there,\n\n91\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.160\nbut they changed the name to standard.\n\n92\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.900\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nthis is a PDF.\n\n93\n00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.460\nAnd do, this PDF is going to be\ntheir commercial licensing reference\n\n94\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.540\nguide which will explain the licensing\nmodel that they have to offer for\n\n95\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.798\nthis particular operating system.\n\n96\n00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:54.720\nI do wanna point out that it is\ndifferent with Sever 2016, so\n\n97\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.645\nyou will need to be aware of that and\nunderstand that when, if you are in charge\n\n98\n00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:03.675\nof the acquisition for these particular\nlicense within your environment.\n\n99\n00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:07.615\nAnd if we scroll down here, so\nthat document we were just looking at,\n\n100\n00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:11.135\nthat chart to show the different\nadditions, this is and\n\n101\n00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:15.715\nI wanna say this is from,\nas you can see here, May of 2017.\n\n102\n00:06:15.715 --> 00:06:21.900\nSo these prices reflect\nthat particular time frame.\n\n103\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.287\nAnd when I say these prices,\nI'm talking about this chart right here.\n\n104\n00:06:25.287 --> 00:06:29.070\nAnd you can see the different\neditions that I'm talking about and\n\n105\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.250\nthat we will continue to cover right here.\n\n106\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.440\nSo this is your standard which replaced\nthat enterprise edition, and like I said\n\n107\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.340\nyou can have your two virtual OSE and\nlet me clarify what OSE stands for.\n\n108\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.420\nOSE stands for\noperating system environment.\n\n109\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.720\nAnd you have now,\nwith the advent of virtualization,\n\n110\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.690\nthe ability to have a virtual operating\nsystem environment, which is a VOSE or\n\n111\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.634\na physical operating system environment,\nwhich is a POSE.\n\n112\n00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:00.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, there you go.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n113\n00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:04.280\nI know, it's such a strange word,\nand I don't come up with this stuff.\n\n114\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.810\nBut that's something that you'll need to\n\n115\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.130\nunderstand those terms if you're trying\nto sift to this documentation and\n\n116\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.190\nsort out and choose the correct licensing\nfor your organization, or your needs.\n\n117\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.420\nSo it's also important to\nnote that they do restrict,\n\n118\n00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.890\nlike I mentioned with\nthe processors as well.\n\n119\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.340\nSo with that standard edition,\n\n120\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.320\nyou get your two VOSEs, you can have\nup to two virtual instances there.\n\n121\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.675\nAnd it's really designed for those\nhighly non virtualized environments and\n\n122\n00:07:33.675 --> 00:07:38.710\nthat's really gonna be the main\ndifference there between datacenter.\n\n123\n00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.400\nYou're not losing out on those features,\nso it is important to know that.\n\n124\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.149\nBut taking a step down, if we take a look,\noops, here at our essentials, all right?\n\n125\n00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:52.431\nWith essentials, you have the ability to\nhave one operating system environment.\n\n126\n00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:55.770\nSo, this could be physical or\nvirtual there.\n\n127\n00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.552\nNow for your server, you still can\nhave up to those two processors.\n\n128\n00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:03.180\nThere is a 25 user limit here.\n\n129\n00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.640\nSo that's pretty important to note,\nwe're not talking large organizations.\n\n130\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.410\nSo that's definitely\nsomething to consider,\n\n131\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.530\nbut you can see right here the price\nwill definitely reflected, as well.\n\n132\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.050\nSo if you're smaller business,\nyou wanna have some of those features, but\n\n133\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.670\nyou don't wanna go ahead or\nyou can't spend the price tag\n\n134\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.105\nthat's associated with that Datacenter\nEdition and that would be a good solution.\n\n135\n00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:29.285\nNow, the Foundation Edition is\nnot always a viable option for\n\n136\n00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:33.835\na lot of organizations especially\nbecause you can only have that\n\n137\n00:08:33.835 --> 00:08:37.270\nFoundation Edition installed\non a physical machine.\n\n138\n00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.840\nAnd as a matter of fact,\n\n139\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.170\nyou won't even be the one installing\nit when you received that.\n\n140\n00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:48.280\nWhat I mean is, it comes by OEM only,\noriginal equipment manufacturer.\n\n141\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.270\nSo it's usually pre-installed on a system,\non a physical machine.\n\n142\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:59.360\nAnd you also have a significant\nlimitation of up to 15 users as well.\n\n143\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.740\nSo those are some things to consider.\n\n144\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.940\nAnd it's kind of interesting when\nyou look at this model, just\n\n145\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.454\nto know the difference, you may encounter\nsome type of scenario based question.\n\n146\n00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:17.730\nAnd in this PDF that you will have\naccess to here in the attached files,\n\n147\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.990\nyou might wanna really just\nsift through and look at it.\n\n148\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:25.940\nThere's a lot to understand and looking\neven at that processor limitation here.\n\n149\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.360\nLet me just spend a second\nto kind of explain\n\n150\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.920\nwhat I would talk about in a scenario\nbased type of environment.\n\n151\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.251\nSo, here you have licensing examples and\n\n152\n00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:38.390\nthey tell you about the One 1-processor\nand non-virtualized server.\n\n153\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.820\nThey're giving you different solutions or\nscenarios that you need to understand\n\n154\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.330\nwhich licenses would work best for\nthat particular scenario.\n\n155\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.110\nDown here at the bottom,\nlet's take a look at this one.\n\n156\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:55.607\nIt says, if you have One 2-processor\nserver with 12 virtual OSEs,\n\n157\n00:09:55.607 --> 00:10:00.590\nhow many datacenter\nlicenses would be required.\n\n158\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.580\nSo the big difference here, like I was\ntrying to point out between datacenter and\n\n159\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.425\nstandard, would be the number\nof virtual machines.\n\n160\n00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:10.350\nProcessor-wise, that part's\ngoing to be the same.\n\n161\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.390\nSo you'd only need one data center\nlicense for this particular scenario.\n\n162\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:20.510\nHowever, you would need\nsix standard licenses for\n\n163\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.015\nthe same scenario because\nyou are limited to that two,\n\n164\n00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:30.140\ntwo virtual operating system environments\nand here they're requesting 12.\n\n165\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.700\nSo 12 divided by 2 is 6.\n\n166\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.400\nJust being able to logically walk through\nthat process and understand, that is\n\n167\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.922\nreally what they are looking for when they\nare talking about this licensing model.\n\n168\n00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:44.060\nNow that's not everything that you would\nwant to know in a real life practicing\n\n169\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.160\nenvironment.\n\n170\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.410\nThere is also some really cool\n\n171\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.210\ntypes of considerations as they go\ninto planning here, more in depth.\n\n172\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.740\nAddition comparisons.\n\n173\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.950\nI even have a chart that I\nwill share with you guys.\n\n174\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.780\nI think it's right here.\n\n175\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.550\nAnd it's way too small\nto cover on this screen.\n\n176\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.940\nBut I am attaching them as well.\n\n177\n00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.610\nThis is like a really deep dive into the\ndifferent features that are available with\n\n178\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.770\nthe different editions there, so that's\ngood to just take a look at as well.\n\n179\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.395\nAnd scrolling down,\nwe look at something else.\n\n180\n00:11:18.395 --> 00:11:20.570\nIt's called Software Assurance Benefits.\n\n181\n00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.010\nNow, this isn't going to be for everyone.\n\n182\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.940\nIt's kind of like a road side\nassistance where if you are utilizing\n\n183\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.760\nthe Microsoft volume licensing,\nyou have the ability to go ahead and\n\n184\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.180\npurchase Software Assurance Benefits for\n\n185\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.110\ntelephone support and support for the\nAzure Fabric, if you're utilizing that.\n\n186\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.500\nBut just know that it is an option if\nyou want that additional support there.\n\n187\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.790\nAll right and what's next?\n\n188\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.381\nSo definitely take a look at that PDF.\n\n189\n00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:56.063\nThere are couple other additions\nthat I wanna point out that\n\n190\n00:11:56.063 --> 00:11:59.450\nare not the four main standard editions.\n\n191\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.500\nOr I really shouldn't use the name\nstandard, but the four popular editions.\n\n192\n00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.760\nThere are some specific editions.\n\n193\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.054\nOne is going to be your Hyper-V server.\n\n194\n00:12:09.054 --> 00:12:15.220\nAnd Hyper-V is really designed for\na virtualization production environment.\n\n195\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.090\nSo as a matter of fact, Microsoft\noffers this particular addition for\n\n196\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.130\nfree on their site.\n\n197\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.890\nSo if you go to our evaluation center, you\ncan go ahead and download that for free.\n\n198\n00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:32.385\nAnd Microsoft's recommendation is that\nyou only run, you run this particular\n\n199\n00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:36.545\nedition if you're running virtual\nmachines, so that would be a great way.\n\n200\n00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:40.175\nIt has a smaller footprint for\nyou to go ahead and run them.\n\n201\n00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:45.512\nAnother one is going to be\nWindows Storage Server 2012 R2 and\n\n202\n00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:49.742\nthat is going to be a really designed for\nstoring files and\n\n203\n00:12:49.742 --> 00:12:53.112\nusing it as centralized file storage.\n\n204\n00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:57.260\nAnd then lastly there's one additional\nwhich is our Windows Multipoint server.\n\n205\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.660\nAnd if you think back, some of you\nwho may have been working in IT for\n\n206\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.650\na while, we used to call this\nlike our terminal server.\n\n207\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.560\nSo if you're utilizing remote desktop and\nyou have a lot of machines connecting to\n\n208\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.580\nthat one operating system, then that\nwould be a good solution for you.\n\n209\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.260\nNow there is a caveat to that.\n\n210\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.150\nIf you think about that licensing model\nthat we just covered, you're not gonna be\n\n211\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.710\nable to escape by with only paying for one\noperating system if you have multiple end\n\n212\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.300\nusers like a hundred end users connecting\nto that machine or however many.\n\n213\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.730\nSo you would also need to think about\nadditional licensing which is called CALs,\n\n214\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.860\nClient Access Licensing and\nthose can be on a per user,\n\n215\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.150\nper machine base type of access\nto make sure that you're not\n\n216\n00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.820\nskirting any kind of\nlicensing obligations there.\n\n217\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.240\nYou wanna make sure that\nyou're in compliance so\n\n218\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.580\nthat if you ever get audited, which\nyou do have the ability to get audited\n\n219\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.160\nby Microsoft because this is a paid\nproducts that we're talking about here.\n\n220\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.350\nSo you just wanna be aware of that.\n\n221\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.370\nAlright, Roni I think we also need to talk\nabout some old system requirements right?\n\n222\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.712\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because this is also\n\n223\n00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:08.660\nimportant when you're thinking\nabout planning your environment.\n\n224\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.500\nYou wanna make sure that you\nhave the hardware to be able\n\n225\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.560\nto support what you have going on.\n\n226\n00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.330\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n227\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:22.160\nThere really three essential components\nthat we really need to focus on.\n\n228\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.780\nNumber one, is gonna be the processor.\n\n229\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:29.280\nYou need to have at least a 1.4\ngigahertz and of course 64-bit.\n\n230\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.770\nLike I had mentioned.\n\n231\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.850\nWe're talking about\na 64-bit architecture for\n\n232\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.640\nboth additions 2000, 2000 R2 and all of\nthe additions that we spoke about here.\n\n233\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.930\nSo let's just be clear on that.\n\n234\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.658\nNow, RAM, this is a funny one here guys.\n\n235\n00:14:45.658 --> 00:14:51.380\nSo this is gonna be your minimum and I\nsay, this is definitely the minimum here.\n\n236\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:57.220\nThey're not being generous or\nkind of overcompensating or whatsoever.\n\n237\n00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.820\nThe operating system will run.\n\n238\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.440\nHow well will it run?\n\n239\n00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.180\nEspecially if you think about any kind of\nadditional roles, features, third party\n\n240\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.190\nsoftware that you're gonna be installing,\nyou will need to consider that as well.\n\n241\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.890\nBut that's the minimum, 512 megabytes.\n\n242\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.280\nAnother important factor here.\n\n243\n00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.440\nLet me just zoom out.\n\n244\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.490\nIs going to be our disk space requirements\nand this is just as important to\n\n245\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.300\nunderstand that this is again, that bare\nminimum here for 32 GB worth of storage.\n\n246\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.814\nYou always have to consider what you're\ngonna be using that machine for and\n\n247\n00:15:34.814 --> 00:15:39.433\nif you increase the RAM up to more\nthan 16 GB, you're also gonna need to\n\n248\n00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:44.613\nincrease this disk space for your paging\nfile, your system reserve partition.\n\n249\n00:15:44.613 --> 00:15:46.798\nSo there are a lot of\nthings to consider and\n\n250\n00:15:46.798 --> 00:15:50.370\nthat's also part of the planning\nwhen you're setting up a server.\n\n251\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.910\nIs this going to be a dedicated server?\n\n252\n00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.940\nAm I gonna be hosting multiple roles?\n\n253\n00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.249\nDo I have multiple connections?\n\n254\n00:15:56.249 --> 00:16:00.110\nSo it's always gonna be\nunique to your project.\n\n255\n00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.160\nFor instance, how many network\ninterface cards am I gonna have?\n\n256\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.540\nAm I gonna be using NIC teaming?\n\n257\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.630\nSo these are all things to consider, but\n\n258\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.430\nMicrosoft really calls out those\nthree system requirements.\n\n259\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.930\nWhich are also gonna be the exact same for\nServer Core, so\n\n260\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.020\nthat's kind of a plus when you're\nstudying for your exam there.\n\n261\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.005\nAlthough Server Core does have a smaller\nfootprint, they call out the same system\n\n262\n00:16:20.005 --> 00:16:23.120\nrequirements, so that's\nan interesting fact to know as well.\n\n263\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.960\nAll right,\nlooking at our memory limitations,\n\n264\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.730\nI think this is pretty cool too.\n\n265\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.790\nIf you just kind of take a journey,\nyou know a trip in time here,\n\n266\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.740\nlet me see,\nI don't wanna scroll you guys to death.\n\n267\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.560\nBut it's kind of neat to see where\nwe started and where we're going.\n\n268\n00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.590\nWe're not gonna focus too much on 2016,\nthere's a show for that.\n\n269\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.690\nBut, here even looking at Server 2008,\nright?\n\n270\n00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:55.190\nWe have approximately on most\neditions 1 terabyte limitation for\n\n271\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.276\nthe maximum amount of memory that\ncan be installed in this system.\n\n272\n00:16:58.276 --> 00:17:03.210\nMoving forward, to Server 2008 R2,\n\n273\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:09.440\nyou can see we about double up there and\neven 2 terabytes of memory max.\n\n274\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.380\nAnd moving forward in time, so with\nServer 2012, we're really looking at here\n\n275\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.565\nfor the larger editions, the enterprise\neditions here, data centered and standard.\n\n276\n00:17:20.565 --> 00:17:24.110\n4 terabytes worth of memory,\nso that's pretty impressive.\n\n277\n00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.310\nAgain, 2016, with each version,\n\n278\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:30.140\neach enhancement,\nwe're trying to grow and get better but\n\n279\n00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.890\nthat's just nice to know there for\nyour theoretical limitations for memory.\n\n280\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:41.480\nAnd it is also important to point out\nthat we talk about our versions and\n\n281\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.090\ntrying to add features,\nsecurity enhancements,\n\n282\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.170\nwhen Server 2012 was first rolled out,\nit was great.\n\n283\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:54.690\nIt had a lot of cool features that\n2008 R2 didn't have to offer, but\n\n284\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:00.630\nagain with most other operating systems\nand software it did have a version two,\n\n285\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.420\nso that's going to be Server 2008 R2.\n\n286\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.120\nWith R2 we saw a lot of different\nfeatures being enabled and added.\n\n287\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.070\nAnd if we take a look at my screen here,\n\n288\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.420\nI also will share this with you,\nit's a list.\n\n289\n00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.950\nAnd it's a laundry list of\na lot of different things.\n\n290\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:23.680\nAuthentication enhancements, but\nmost notably we're talking desired state\n\n291\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.130\nconfiguration was added, work folders,\nthere's just a lot of different\n\n292\n00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:34.030\nreally cool features, additional\nvirtualization Linux support integrated.\n\n293\n00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.370\nSo, that's definitely something to\nconsider if your organization is looking\n\n294\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.560\nfor a particular feature, make sure\nyou're choosing the right edition.\n\n295\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.640\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, I just wanna make sure\nthat we corrected this right away here.\n\n296\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.895\nShe did say Server 2008 R2\neven in describing that,\n\n297\n00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:53.280\nbut she did mean Server 2012 R2.\n\n298\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.880\n&gt;&gt; Did I [LAUGH]?\n\n299\n00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.390\n&gt;&gt; So if you, yeah, if you heard that cuz\nI was listening I was she described that\n\n300\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.830\nthere was an upgrade but remember\nthat you do need to understand that.\n\n301\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.390\nAnd this particular show without Cherokee,\n\n302\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.160\nwe're basing everything\naround server 2012 R2, right?\n\n303\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so if I do, and\nguys just forgive me up front,\n\n304\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.790\nI'll put in a little disclaimer\nright away, if I say server 2012,\n\n305\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.560\ncumulatively speaking I'm mostly likely\ntalking about Server 2012 R2 because\n\n306\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.010\nthat's the newer version of the two.\n\n307\n00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.760\nSo from here on out on this show,\nthat's what we'll really be working with\n\n308\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.900\nwhenever we're looking at hands on\nactivities and digging in there.\n\n309\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.240\nSo I think that's a good place\nto ahead and get started.\n\n310\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.480\nI know it's a lot of information for\nyou to absorb, but\n\n311\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.690\nwe've got some really cool\nfeatures headed your way, so\n\n312\n00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.910\nI can't wait to get started\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, thank you again for\n\n313\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.376\nhelping us out with this idea of\nplanning for a server installation.\n\n314\n00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:51.540\nNow that we took look at the different\nadditions that we have available to us\n\n315\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.390\nwith Server 2012 R2, and this is gonna be\nimportant when choosing the right one for\n\n316\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.400\nyour particular business model\nthat you need to follow.\n\n317\n00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.980\nThe scenario that Cherokee\ngave us is something\n\n318\n00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.980\nthat we want to make sure we understand,\nespecially gefore going into the exam.\n\n319\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.840\nDo not be surprised if you see\na question or two on that,\n\n320\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.100\nlike which of the following would\nyou actually choose for this?\n\n321\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.500\nNow you do have to plan for\nthings that you might hear as well,\n\n322\n00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.200\nwhich is of course scalability\nis kinda the big thing so\n\n323\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.200\ndon't just limit yourself to one and\ngoing this will fit perfectly.\n\n324\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.983\nEspecially if they're asking for\nscaling and\n\n325\n00:20:24.983 --> 00:20:27.740\nyou might have that kind of jump\nup to the next edition as well.\n\n326\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.980\nAnd then of course, knowing the system\nrequirements that we have available,\n\n327\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.130\nthat's also gonna be a help as well.\n\n328\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.985\nBut that means we are now ready to get\nstarted on the installation of Server, but\n\n329\n00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:40.465\nthat's gonna be for another episode then.\n\n330\n00:20:40.465 --> 00:20:44.555\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n331\n00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:45.685\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n332\n00:20:45.685 --> 00:20:51.337\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 show.\n\n333\n00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:57.246\n[MUSIC]\n\n334\n00:20:57.246 --> 00:21:00.743\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:15.350\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.100\nYou're watching the MCSA Windows Server\n2012 R2 show for Exam 70-410.\n\n5\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.590\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n6\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.520\nand today we're gonna jump into\nplanning for a Server installation.\n\n7\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.570\nAnd here to help us is going to\nbe of course, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.390\nCherokee, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, I'm doing great,\nhow are you today, Ronnie?\n\n10\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.020\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n11\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.870\nNow Cherokee, as we take a look\nat this idea of planning for\n\n12\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.750\na Server installation in 2012 R2,\nwe want to make\n\n13\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.210\nsure that we understand the purpose behind\nthe planning and why this is important.\n\n14\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.520\nSo take us back a little bit when\nwe start talking about like,\n\n15\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.490\neven 2008 a little bit, and why this\nactually is different or is it different?\n\n16\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so planning is a large,\njust like any big major project,\n\n17\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.240\nyou always want to spend good amount of\ntime to make sure you're ready, but for\n\n18\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.600\nyou just a head and dive into something.\n\n19\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.000\nIt's extremely important because there are\na lot of different aspects to think about\n\n20\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.760\njust not only within network design, but\nyou also have things like licensing and\n\n21\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.560\nadditions that you need\nto consider as well.\n\n22\n00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.170\nAnd 2012 brings a lot of\nnew concepts to the table.\n\n23\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.940\nThey've done things differently\nthan Server 2008 and\n\n24\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.160\neven Server 2016 has their\nown details as well.\n\n25\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.660\nSo, it's important to\nunderstand the differences,\n\n26\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.590\nyou are expected to know that for\nthe exam.\n\n27\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590\nSo let's go ahead, and like Ronnie said,\n\n28\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.500\nlet's think about some of you may have\nalready been working with Server 2008.\n\n29\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.470\nAnd you'll notice there you had,\noriginally with the 2008 version,\n\n30\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.310\nyou had the option still to go\nwith that 32 bit or 64 bit.\n\n31\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.521\nAnd with 2008 R2,\nyou only had that 64 bit option.\n\n32\n00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:01.513\nSo 2012 kind of adopted that, and most,\nI mean we're not probably gonna be\n\n33\n00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:04.032\nregressing anytime soon\nback to those 32 bits.\n\n34\n00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:08.517\nSo that simplifies things\nin some way there.\n\n35\n00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:13.421\nSo moving forward,\nwe're not gonna be working with those 32\n\n36\n00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.120\nbit systems anymore, so that helps.\n\n37\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.405\nAnd if we look at the different\ntypes of additions,\n\n38\n00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:22.300\nso they have tried to streamline that.\n\n39\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.630\nIf we take a look at my screen,\n\n40\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.350\nwe don't see the same additions\nthat we saw in Server 2008.\n\n41\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.090\nAnd a slight difference\nhere with the name change.\n\n42\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.840\nWe'll talk about each one of our four\nmain additions here in a moment,\n\n43\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.780\nwhich in 2008 they were foundation,\nstandard, enterprise, and data centers.\n\n44\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.270\nSo the names have changed slightly.\n\n45\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.320\nI will alert you to that, but\nwe do not see our web server anymore,\n\n46\n00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.090\nour HPC, the high performance cuting,\nor our itanium based, for\n\n47\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.820\nthe itanium processors for\nthose servers as well.\n\n48\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.340\nSo, those are going to\nbe some differences,\n\n49\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.770\nbut if you think about it in\neven the most generic way.\n\n50\n00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.180\nAnd, Ronnie, I know we were talking\nabout kind of describing it as a car,\n\n51\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.770\nlike if we talk about the make being\nCadillac, the model of the car\n\n52\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.550\nis almost alikened to the version of\nthis particular operating system.\n\n53\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.593\nSo let's take a look at bits and\nthink about okay,\n\n54\n00:03:21.593 --> 00:03:26.210\nwell what's the big mack daddy,\nthe escalate here, right?\n\n55\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.660\nSo that would be your\ndata center additions.\n\n56\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.090\nSo data center additions\nis going to be designed for\n\n57\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.440\nhighly virtualized environments.\n\n58\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.910\nSo with the data center addition,\n\n59\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.828\nyou can have an unlimited amount\nof virtual instances running.\n\n60\n00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:43.080\nYou are gonna see that\nreflected in the cost, so\n\n61\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.280\nwe're talking about the most\nexpensive addition, but\n\n62\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.570\nit's going to be necessary in\na highly virtualized environment.\n\n63\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.320\nYou have up to 64 processor support\nincluding fault tolerance and\n\n64\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.880\nthe ability for hot add processors,\nwhich is pretty cool for\n\n65\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.540\nthat redundancy and that stability\nin a larger enterprise there.\n\n66\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.750\nI will note that the way you\ncan obtain your data center\n\n67\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.520\nedition is gonna be through\nMicrosoft Volume Licensing only.\n\n68\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.889\nAnd so we'll talk about licensing\nhere a few moments, but\n\n69\n00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.580\njust know that data center, virtualized\nenvironments, that's the way to go.\n\n70\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.110\nNow, if you wanna go ahead and\ntake a step down.\n\n71\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.210\nSo maybe you want all the features\nthat the data center has to offer but\n\n72\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.650\nyou don't need all those\nvirtualized instances.\n\n73\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.810\nYou may only need a few or\nmaybe more beneficial,\n\n74\n00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.770\nmaybe you only had four virtual\ninstance you wanted to run.\n\n75\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.560\nSo looking at the cost for\n\n76\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.020\nthe full blown unlimited really doesn't\nwarrant you spending that much money.\n\n77\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.180\nSo you could go ahead and take a step\ndown, and when I say step down you're not\n\n78\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.800\nlosing out on any of those great features,\nyou're just gonna be limited in\n\n79\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.560\nthe amount of instances that you have\nrunning for that particular edition.\n\n80\n00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.670\nSo with your standard edition,\nyou're gonna be limited to two per for\n\n81\n00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.685\neach license,\nit's gonna be two virtual instances.\n\n82\n00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:07.420\nSo just to clarify,\nthat's not a software limitation,\n\n83\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.580\nthat's gonna be a licensing limitation or\nyou would need to buy additional licenses.\n\n84\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nbefore we move on there and\n\n85\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.340\nyou now moved into the realm of standard.\n\n86\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.430\nWhat we were seeing earlier in the graphic\nthat you showed us is that there was\n\n87\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.400\nan enterprise edition, as well.\n\n88\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.750\nSo what happened to\nthe enterprise edition?\n\n89\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.440\n&gt;&gt; So Microsoft has a propensity to\nkind of rename things after a while.\n\n90\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.070\nSo It's kind of the same concept as\nfar as levels of versions there,\n\n91\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.160\nbut they changed the name to standard.\n\n92\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.900\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nthis is a PDF.\n\n93\n00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.460\nAnd do, this PDF is going to be\ntheir commercial licensing reference\n\n94\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.540\nguide which will explain the licensing\nmodel that they have to offer for\n\n95\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.798\nthis particular operating system.\n\n96\n00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:54.720\nI do wanna point out that it is\ndifferent with Sever 2016, so\n\n97\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.645\nyou will need to be aware of that and\nunderstand that when, if you are in charge\n\n98\n00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:03.675\nof the acquisition for these particular\nlicense within your environment.\n\n99\n00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:07.615\nAnd if we scroll down here, so\nthat document we were just looking at,\n\n100\n00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:11.135\nthat chart to show the different\nadditions, this is and\n\n101\n00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:15.715\nI wanna say this is from,\nas you can see here, May of 2017.\n\n102\n00:06:15.715 --> 00:06:21.900\nSo these prices reflect\nthat particular time frame.\n\n103\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.287\nAnd when I say these prices,\nI'm talking about this chart right here.\n\n104\n00:06:25.287 --> 00:06:29.070\nAnd you can see the different\neditions that I'm talking about and\n\n105\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.250\nthat we will continue to cover right here.\n\n106\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.440\nSo this is your standard which replaced\nthat enterprise edition, and like I said\n\n107\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.340\nyou can have your two virtual OSE and\nlet me clarify what OSE stands for.\n\n108\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.420\nOSE stands for\noperating system environment.\n\n109\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.720\nAnd you have now,\nwith the advent of virtualization,\n\n110\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.690\nthe ability to have a virtual operating\nsystem environment, which is a VOSE or\n\n111\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.634\na physical operating system environment,\nwhich is a POSE.\n\n112\n00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:00.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, there you go.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n113\n00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:04.280\nI know, it's such a strange word,\nand I don't come up with this stuff.\n\n114\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.810\nBut that's something that you'll need to\n\n115\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.130\nunderstand those terms if you're trying\nto sift to this documentation and\n\n116\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.190\nsort out and choose the correct licensing\nfor your organization, or your needs.\n\n117\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.420\nSo it's also important to\nnote that they do restrict,\n\n118\n00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.890\nlike I mentioned with\nthe processors as well.\n\n119\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.340\nSo with that standard edition,\n\n120\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.320\nyou get your two VOSEs, you can have\nup to two virtual instances there.\n\n121\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.675\nAnd it's really designed for those\nhighly non virtualized environments and\n\n122\n00:07:33.675 --> 00:07:38.710\nthat's really gonna be the main\ndifference there between datacenter.\n\n123\n00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.400\nYou're not losing out on those features,\nso it is important to know that.\n\n124\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.149\nBut taking a step down, if we take a look,\noops, here at our essentials, all right?\n\n125\n00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:52.431\nWith essentials, you have the ability to\nhave one operating system environment.\n\n126\n00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:55.770\nSo, this could be physical or\nvirtual there.\n\n127\n00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.552\nNow for your server, you still can\nhave up to those two processors.\n\n128\n00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:03.180\nThere is a 25 user limit here.\n\n129\n00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.640\nSo that's pretty important to note,\nwe're not talking large organizations.\n\n130\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.410\nSo that's definitely\nsomething to consider,\n\n131\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.530\nbut you can see right here the price\nwill definitely reflected, as well.\n\n132\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.050\nSo if you're smaller business,\nyou wanna have some of those features, but\n\n133\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.670\nyou don't wanna go ahead or\nyou can't spend the price tag\n\n134\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.105\nthat's associated with that Datacenter\nEdition and that would be a good solution.\n\n135\n00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:29.285\nNow, the Foundation Edition is\nnot always a viable option for\n\n136\n00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:33.835\na lot of organizations especially\nbecause you can only have that\n\n137\n00:08:33.835 --> 00:08:37.270\nFoundation Edition installed\non a physical machine.\n\n138\n00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.840\nAnd as a matter of fact,\n\n139\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.170\nyou won't even be the one installing\nit when you received that.\n\n140\n00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:48.280\nWhat I mean is, it comes by OEM only,\noriginal equipment manufacturer.\n\n141\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.270\nSo it's usually pre-installed on a system,\non a physical machine.\n\n142\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:59.360\nAnd you also have a significant\nlimitation of up to 15 users as well.\n\n143\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.740\nSo those are some things to consider.\n\n144\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.940\nAnd it's kind of interesting when\nyou look at this model, just\n\n145\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.454\nto know the difference, you may encounter\nsome type of scenario based question.\n\n146\n00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:17.730\nAnd in this PDF that you will have\naccess to here in the attached files,\n\n147\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.990\nyou might wanna really just\nsift through and look at it.\n\n148\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:25.940\nThere's a lot to understand and looking\neven at that processor limitation here.\n\n149\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.360\nLet me just spend a second\nto kind of explain\n\n150\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.920\nwhat I would talk about in a scenario\nbased type of environment.\n\n151\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.251\nSo, here you have licensing examples and\n\n152\n00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:38.390\nthey tell you about the One 1-processor\nand non-virtualized server.\n\n153\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.820\nThey're giving you different solutions or\nscenarios that you need to understand\n\n154\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.330\nwhich licenses would work best for\nthat particular scenario.\n\n155\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.110\nDown here at the bottom,\nlet's take a look at this one.\n\n156\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:55.607\nIt says, if you have One 2-processor\nserver with 12 virtual OSEs,\n\n157\n00:09:55.607 --> 00:10:00.590\nhow many datacenter\nlicenses would be required.\n\n158\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.580\nSo the big difference here, like I was\ntrying to point out between datacenter and\n\n159\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.425\nstandard, would be the number\nof virtual machines.\n\n160\n00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:10.350\nProcessor-wise, that part's\ngoing to be the same.\n\n161\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.390\nSo you'd only need one data center\nlicense for this particular scenario.\n\n162\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:20.510\nHowever, you would need\nsix standard licenses for\n\n163\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.015\nthe same scenario because\nyou are limited to that two,\n\n164\n00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:30.140\ntwo virtual operating system environments\nand here they're requesting 12.\n\n165\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.700\nSo 12 divided by 2 is 6.\n\n166\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.400\nJust being able to logically walk through\nthat process and understand, that is\n\n167\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.922\nreally what they are looking for when they\nare talking about this licensing model.\n\n168\n00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:44.060\nNow that's not everything that you would\nwant to know in a real life practicing\n\n169\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.160\nenvironment.\n\n170\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.410\nThere is also some really cool\n\n171\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.210\ntypes of considerations as they go\ninto planning here, more in depth.\n\n172\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.740\nAddition comparisons.\n\n173\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.950\nI even have a chart that I\nwill share with you guys.\n\n174\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.780\nI think it's right here.\n\n175\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.550\nAnd it's way too small\nto cover on this screen.\n\n176\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.940\nBut I am attaching them as well.\n\n177\n00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.610\nThis is like a really deep dive into the\ndifferent features that are available with\n\n178\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.770\nthe different editions there, so that's\ngood to just take a look at as well.\n\n179\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.395\nAnd scrolling down,\nwe look at something else.\n\n180\n00:11:18.395 --> 00:11:20.570\nIt's called Software Assurance Benefits.\n\n181\n00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.010\nNow, this isn't going to be for everyone.\n\n182\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.940\nIt's kind of like a road side\nassistance where if you are utilizing\n\n183\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.760\nthe Microsoft volume licensing,\nyou have the ability to go ahead and\n\n184\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.180\npurchase Software Assurance Benefits for\n\n185\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.110\ntelephone support and support for the\nAzure Fabric, if you're utilizing that.\n\n186\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.500\nBut just know that it is an option if\nyou want that additional support there.\n\n187\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.790\nAll right and what's next?\n\n188\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.381\nSo definitely take a look at that PDF.\n\n189\n00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:56.063\nThere are couple other additions\nthat I wanna point out that\n\n190\n00:11:56.063 --> 00:11:59.450\nare not the four main standard editions.\n\n191\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.500\nOr I really shouldn't use the name\nstandard, but the four popular editions.\n\n192\n00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.760\nThere are some specific editions.\n\n193\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.054\nOne is going to be your Hyper-V server.\n\n194\n00:12:09.054 --> 00:12:15.220\nAnd Hyper-V is really designed for\na virtualization production environment.\n\n195\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.090\nSo as a matter of fact, Microsoft\noffers this particular addition for\n\n196\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.130\nfree on their site.\n\n197\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.890\nSo if you go to our evaluation center, you\ncan go ahead and download that for free.\n\n198\n00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:32.385\nAnd Microsoft's recommendation is that\nyou only run, you run this particular\n\n199\n00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:36.545\nedition if you're running virtual\nmachines, so that would be a great way.\n\n200\n00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:40.175\nIt has a smaller footprint for\nyou to go ahead and run them.\n\n201\n00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:45.512\nAnother one is going to be\nWindows Storage Server 2012 R2 and\n\n202\n00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:49.742\nthat is going to be a really designed for\nstoring files and\n\n203\n00:12:49.742 --> 00:12:53.112\nusing it as centralized file storage.\n\n204\n00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:57.260\nAnd then lastly there's one additional\nwhich is our Windows Multipoint server.\n\n205\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.660\nAnd if you think back, some of you\nwho may have been working in IT for\n\n206\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.650\na while, we used to call this\nlike our terminal server.\n\n207\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.560\nSo if you're utilizing remote desktop and\nyou have a lot of machines connecting to\n\n208\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.580\nthat one operating system, then that\nwould be a good solution for you.\n\n209\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.260\nNow there is a caveat to that.\n\n210\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.150\nIf you think about that licensing model\nthat we just covered, you're not gonna be\n\n211\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.710\nable to escape by with only paying for one\noperating system if you have multiple end\n\n212\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.300\nusers like a hundred end users connecting\nto that machine or however many.\n\n213\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.730\nSo you would also need to think about\nadditional licensing which is called CALs,\n\n214\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.860\nClient Access Licensing and\nthose can be on a per user,\n\n215\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.150\nper machine base type of access\nto make sure that you're not\n\n216\n00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.820\nskirting any kind of\nlicensing obligations there.\n\n217\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.240\nYou wanna make sure that\nyou're in compliance so\n\n218\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.580\nthat if you ever get audited, which\nyou do have the ability to get audited\n\n219\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.160\nby Microsoft because this is a paid\nproducts that we're talking about here.\n\n220\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.350\nSo you just wanna be aware of that.\n\n221\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.370\nAlright, Roni I think we also need to talk\nabout some old system requirements right?\n\n222\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.712\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because this is also\n\n223\n00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:08.660\nimportant when you're thinking\nabout planning your environment.\n\n224\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.500\nYou wanna make sure that you\nhave the hardware to be able\n\n225\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.560\nto support what you have going on.\n\n226\n00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.330\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n227\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:22.160\nThere really three essential components\nthat we really need to focus on.\n\n228\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.780\nNumber one, is gonna be the processor.\n\n229\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:29.280\nYou need to have at least a 1.4\ngigahertz and of course 64-bit.\n\n230\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.770\nLike I had mentioned.\n\n231\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.850\nWe're talking about\na 64-bit architecture for\n\n232\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.640\nboth additions 2000, 2000 R2 and all of\nthe additions that we spoke about here.\n\n233\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.930\nSo let's just be clear on that.\n\n234\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.658\nNow, RAM, this is a funny one here guys.\n\n235\n00:14:45.658 --> 00:14:51.380\nSo this is gonna be your minimum and I\nsay, this is definitely the minimum here.\n\n236\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:57.220\nThey're not being generous or\nkind of overcompensating or whatsoever.\n\n237\n00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.820\nThe operating system will run.\n\n238\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.440\nHow well will it run?\n\n239\n00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.180\nEspecially if you think about any kind of\nadditional roles, features, third party\n\n240\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.190\nsoftware that you're gonna be installing,\nyou will need to consider that as well.\n\n241\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.890\nBut that's the minimum, 512 megabytes.\n\n242\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.280\nAnother important factor here.\n\n243\n00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.440\nLet me just zoom out.\n\n244\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.490\nIs going to be our disk space requirements\nand this is just as important to\n\n245\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.300\nunderstand that this is again, that bare\nminimum here for 32 GB worth of storage.\n\n246\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.814\nYou always have to consider what you're\ngonna be using that machine for and\n\n247\n00:15:34.814 --> 00:15:39.433\nif you increase the RAM up to more\nthan 16 GB, you're also gonna need to\n\n248\n00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:44.613\nincrease this disk space for your paging\nfile, your system reserve partition.\n\n249\n00:15:44.613 --> 00:15:46.798\nSo there are a lot of\nthings to consider and\n\n250\n00:15:46.798 --> 00:15:50.370\nthat's also part of the planning\nwhen you're setting up a server.\n\n251\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.910\nIs this going to be a dedicated server?\n\n252\n00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.940\nAm I gonna be hosting multiple roles?\n\n253\n00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.249\nDo I have multiple connections?\n\n254\n00:15:56.249 --> 00:16:00.110\nSo it's always gonna be\nunique to your project.\n\n255\n00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.160\nFor instance, how many network\ninterface cards am I gonna have?\n\n256\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.540\nAm I gonna be using NIC teaming?\n\n257\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.630\nSo these are all things to consider, but\n\n258\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.430\nMicrosoft really calls out those\nthree system requirements.\n\n259\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.930\nWhich are also gonna be the exact same for\nServer Core, so\n\n260\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.020\nthat's kind of a plus when you're\nstudying for your exam there.\n\n261\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.005\nAlthough Server Core does have a smaller\nfootprint, they call out the same system\n\n262\n00:16:20.005 --> 00:16:23.120\nrequirements, so that's\nan interesting fact to know as well.\n\n263\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.960\nAll right,\nlooking at our memory limitations,\n\n264\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.730\nI think this is pretty cool too.\n\n265\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.790\nIf you just kind of take a journey,\nyou know a trip in time here,\n\n266\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.740\nlet me see,\nI don't wanna scroll you guys to death.\n\n267\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.560\nBut it's kind of neat to see where\nwe started and where we're going.\n\n268\n00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.590\nWe're not gonna focus too much on 2016,\nthere's a show for that.\n\n269\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.690\nBut, here even looking at Server 2008,\nright?\n\n270\n00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:55.190\nWe have approximately on most\neditions 1 terabyte limitation for\n\n271\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.276\nthe maximum amount of memory that\ncan be installed in this system.\n\n272\n00:16:58.276 --> 00:17:03.210\nMoving forward, to Server 2008 R2,\n\n273\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:09.440\nyou can see we about double up there and\neven 2 terabytes of memory max.\n\n274\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.380\nAnd moving forward in time, so with\nServer 2012, we're really looking at here\n\n275\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.565\nfor the larger editions, the enterprise\neditions here, data centered and standard.\n\n276\n00:17:20.565 --> 00:17:24.110\n4 terabytes worth of memory,\nso that's pretty impressive.\n\n277\n00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.310\nAgain, 2016, with each version,\n\n278\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:30.140\neach enhancement,\nwe're trying to grow and get better but\n\n279\n00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.890\nthat's just nice to know there for\nyour theoretical limitations for memory.\n\n280\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:41.480\nAnd it is also important to point out\nthat we talk about our versions and\n\n281\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.090\ntrying to add features,\nsecurity enhancements,\n\n282\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.170\nwhen Server 2012 was first rolled out,\nit was great.\n\n283\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:54.690\nIt had a lot of cool features that\n2008 R2 didn't have to offer, but\n\n284\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:00.630\nagain with most other operating systems\nand software it did have a version two,\n\n285\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.420\nso that's going to be Server 2008 R2.\n\n286\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.120\nWith R2 we saw a lot of different\nfeatures being enabled and added.\n\n287\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.070\nAnd if we take a look at my screen here,\n\n288\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.420\nI also will share this with you,\nit's a list.\n\n289\n00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.950\nAnd it's a laundry list of\na lot of different things.\n\n290\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:23.680\nAuthentication enhancements, but\nmost notably we're talking desired state\n\n291\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.130\nconfiguration was added, work folders,\nthere's just a lot of different\n\n292\n00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:34.030\nreally cool features, additional\nvirtualization Linux support integrated.\n\n293\n00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.370\nSo, that's definitely something to\nconsider if your organization is looking\n\n294\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.560\nfor a particular feature, make sure\nyou're choosing the right edition.\n\n295\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.640\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, I just wanna make sure\nthat we corrected this right away here.\n\n296\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.895\nShe did say Server 2008 R2\neven in describing that,\n\n297\n00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:53.280\nbut she did mean Server 2012 R2.\n\n298\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.880\n&gt;&gt; Did I [LAUGH]?\n\n299\n00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.390\n&gt;&gt; So if you, yeah, if you heard that cuz\nI was listening I was she described that\n\n300\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.830\nthere was an upgrade but remember\nthat you do need to understand that.\n\n301\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.390\nAnd this particular show without Cherokee,\n\n302\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.160\nwe're basing everything\naround server 2012 R2, right?\n\n303\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so if I do, and\nguys just forgive me up front,\n\n304\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.790\nI'll put in a little disclaimer\nright away, if I say server 2012,\n\n305\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.560\ncumulatively speaking I'm mostly likely\ntalking about Server 2012 R2 because\n\n306\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.010\nthat's the newer version of the two.\n\n307\n00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.760\nSo from here on out on this show,\nthat's what we'll really be working with\n\n308\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.900\nwhenever we're looking at hands on\nactivities and digging in there.\n\n309\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.240\nSo I think that's a good place\nto ahead and get started.\n\n310\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.480\nI know it's a lot of information for\nyou to absorb, but\n\n311\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.690\nwe've got some really cool\nfeatures headed your way, so\n\n312\n00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.910\nI can't wait to get started\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, thank you again for\n\n313\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.376\nhelping us out with this idea of\nplanning for a server installation.\n\n314\n00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:51.540\nNow that we took look at the different\nadditions that we have available to us\n\n315\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.390\nwith Server 2012 R2, and this is gonna be\nimportant when choosing the right one for\n\n316\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.400\nyour particular business model\nthat you need to follow.\n\n317\n00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.980\nThe scenario that Cherokee\ngave us is something\n\n318\n00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.980\nthat we want to make sure we understand,\nespecially gefore going into the exam.\n\n319\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.840\nDo not be surprised if you see\na question or two on that,\n\n320\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.100\nlike which of the following would\nyou actually choose for this?\n\n321\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.500\nNow you do have to plan for\nthings that you might hear as well,\n\n322\n00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.200\nwhich is of course scalability\nis kinda the big thing so\n\n323\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.200\ndon't just limit yourself to one and\ngoing this will fit perfectly.\n\n324\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.983\nEspecially if they're asking for\nscaling and\n\n325\n00:20:24.983 --> 00:20:27.740\nyou might have that kind of jump\nup to the next edition as well.\n\n326\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.980\nAnd then of course, knowing the system\nrequirements that we have available,\n\n327\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.130\nthat's also gonna be a help as well.\n\n328\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.985\nBut that means we are now ready to get\nstarted on the installation of Server, but\n\n329\n00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:40.465\nthat's gonna be for another episode then.\n\n330\n00:20:40.465 --> 00:20:44.555\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n331\n00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:45.685\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n332\n00:20:45.685 --> 00:20:51.337\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 show.\n\n333\n00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:57.246\n[MUSIC]\n\n334\n00:20:57.246 --> 00:21:00.743\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:34.390\r\nCherokee, welcome back to the show,\r\nhow are you doing?\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.960\r\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, I'm doing great,\r\nhow are you today,

for\r\n\r\n12\r\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.750\r\na Server installation in 2012 R2,\r\nwe want to make\r\n\r\n13\r\n00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.210\r\nsure that we understand the purpose behind\r\nthe planning and why this is important.\r\n\r\n14\r\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.520\r\nSo take us back a little bit when\r\nwe start talking about like,\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.490\r\neven 2008 a little bit, and why this\r\nactually is different or is it different?\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.710\r\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so planning is a large,\r\njust like any big major project,\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.240\r\nyou always want to spend good amount of\r\ntime to make sure you're ready, but for\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.600\r\nyou just a head and dive into something.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.000\r\nIt's extremely important because there are\r\na lot of different aspects to think about\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.760\r\njust not only within network design, but\r\nyou also have things like licensing and\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.560\r\nadditions that you need\r\nto consider as well.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.170\r\nAnd 2012 brings a lot of\r\nnew concepts to the table.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.940\r\nThey've done things differently\r\nthan Server 2008 and\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.160\r\neven Server 2016 has their\r\nown details as well.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.660\r\nSo, it's important to\r\nunderstand the differences,\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.590\r\nyou are expected to know that for\r\nthe exam.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590\r\nSo let's go ahead, and like Ronnie said,\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.500\r\nlet's think about some of you may have\r\nalready been working with Server 2008.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.470\r\nAnd you'll notice there you had,\r\noriginally with the 2008 version,\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.310\r\nyou had the option still to go\r\nwith that 32 bit or 64 bit.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.521\r\nAnd with 2008 R2,\r\nyou only had that 64 bit option.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:01.513\r\nSo 2012 kind of adopted that, and most,\r\nI mean we're not probably gonna be\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:04.032\r\nregressing anytime soon\r\nback to those 32 bits.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:08.517\r\nSo that simplifies things\r\nin some way there.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:13.421\r\nSo moving forward,\r\nwe're not gonna be working with those 32\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.120\r\nbit systems anymore, so that helps.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.405\r\nAnd if we look at the different\r\ntypes of additions,\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:02:20.405 --> 00:02:22.300\r\nso they have tried to streamline that.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.630\r\nIf we take a look at my screen,\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.350\r\nwe don't see the same additions\r\nthat we saw in Server 2008.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.090\r\nAnd a slight difference\r\nhere with the name change.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.840\r\nWe'll talk about each one of our four\r\nmain additions here in a moment,\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.780\r\nwhich in 2008 they were foundation,\r\nstandard, enterprise, and data centers.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.270\r\nSo the names have changed slightly.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.320\r\nI will alert you to that, but\r\nwe do not see our web server anymore,\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.090\r\nour HPC, the high performance cuting,\r\nor our itanium based, for\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.820\r\nthe itanium processors for\r\nthose servers as well.\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.340\r\nSo, those are going to\r\nbe some differences,\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.770\r\nbut if you think about it in\r\neven the most generic way.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.180\r\nAnd, Ronnie, I know we were talking\r\nabout kind of describing it as a car,\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.770\r\nlike if we talk about the make being\r\nCadillac, the model of the car\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.550\r\nis almost alikened to the version of\r\nthis particular operating system.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.593\r\nSo let's take a look at bits and\r\nthink about okay,\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:03:21.593 --> 00:03:26.210\r\nwell what's the big mack daddy,\r\nthe escalate here, right?\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.660\r\nSo that would be your\r\ndata center additions.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.090\r\nSo data center additions\r\nis going to be designed for\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.440\r\nhighly virtualized environments.\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.910\r\nSo with the data center addition,\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.828\r\nyou can have an unlimited amount\r\nof virtual instances running.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:43.080\r\nYou are gonna see that\r\nreflected in the cost, so\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.280\r\nwe're talking about the most\r\nexpensive addition, but\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.570\r\nit's going to be necessary in\r\na highly virtualized environment.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.320\r\nYou have up to 64 processor support\r\nincluding fault tolerance and\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.880\r\nthe ability for hot add processors,\r\nwhich is pretty cool for\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.540\r\nthat redundancy and that stability\r\nin a larger enterprise there.\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.750\r\nI will note that the way you\r\ncan obtain your data center\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.520\r\nedition is gonna be through\r\nMicrosoft Volume Licensing only.\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.889\r\nAnd so we'll talk about licensing\r\nhere a few moments, but\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.580\r\njust know that data center, virtualized\r\nenvironments, that's the way to go.\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.110\r\nNow, if you wanna go ahead and\r\ntake a step down.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.210\r\nSo maybe you want all the features\r\nthat the data center has to offer but\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.650\r\nyou don't need all those\r\nvirtualized instances.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.810\r\nYou may only need a few or\r\nmaybe more beneficial,\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.770\r\nmaybe you only had four virtual\r\ninstance you wanted to run.\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.560\r\nSo looking at the cost for\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.020\r\nthe full blown unlimited really doesn't\r\nwarrant you spending that much money.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.180\r\nSo you could go ahead and take a step\r\ndown, and when I say step down you're not\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.800\r\nlosing out on any of those great features,\r\nyou're just gonna be limited in\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.560\r\nthe amount of instances that you have\r\nrunning for that particular edition.\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.670\r\nSo with your standard edition,\r\nyou're gonna be limited to two per for\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.685\r\neach license,\r\nit's gonna be two virtual instances.\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:07.420\r\nSo just to clarify,\r\nthat's not a software limitation,\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.580\r\nthat's gonna be a licensing limitation or\r\nyou would need to buy additional licenses.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.100\r\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\r\nbefore we move on there and\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.340\r\nyou now moved into the realm of standard.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.430\r\nWhat we were seeing earlier in the graphic\r\nthat you showed us is that there was\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.400\r\nan enterprise edition, as well.\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.750\r\nSo what happened to\r\nthe enterprise edition?\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.440\r\n&gt;&gt; So Microsoft has a propensity to\r\nkind of rename things after a while.\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.070\r\nSo It's kind of the same concept as\r\nfar as levels of versions there,\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.160\r\nbut they changed the name to standard.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.900\r\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\r\nthis is a PDF.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.460\r\nAnd do, this PDF is going to be\r\ntheir commercial licensing reference\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.540\r\nguide which will explain the licensing\r\nmodel that they have to offer for\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.798\r\nthis particular operating system.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:54.720\r\nI do wanna point out that it is\r\ndifferent with Sever 2016, so\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.645\r\nyou will need to be aware of that and\r\nunderstand that when, if you are in charge\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:03.675\r\nof the acquisition for these particular\r\nlicense within your environment.\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:07.615\r\nAnd if we scroll down here, so\r\nthat document we were just looking at,\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:11.135\r\nthat chart to show the different\r\nadditions, this is and\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:15.715\r\nI wanna say this is from,\r\nas you can see here, May of 2017.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:06:15.715 --> 00:06:21.900\r\nSo these prices reflect\r\nthat particular time frame.\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.287\r\nAnd when I say these prices,\r\nI'm talking about this chart right here.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:06:25.287 --> 00:06:29.070\r\nAnd you can see the different\r\neditions that I'm talking about and\r\n\r\n105\r\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.250\r\nthat we will continue to cover right here.\r\n\r\n106\r\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.440\r\nSo this is your standard which replaced\r\nthat enterprise edition, and like I said\r\n\r\n107\r\n00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.340\r\nyou can have your two virtual OSE and\r\nlet me clarify what OSE stands for.\r\n\r\n108\r\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.420\r\nOSE stands for\r\noperating system environment.\r\n\r\n109\r\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.720\r\nAnd you have now,\r\nwith the advent of virtualization,\r\n\r\n110\r\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.690\r\nthe ability to have a virtual operating\r\nsystem environment, which is a VOSE or\r\n\r\n111\r\n00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.634\r\na physical operating system environment,\r\nwhich is a POSE.\r\n\r\n112\r\n00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:00.592\r\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, there you go.\r\n[LAUGH] So\r\n\r\n113\r\n00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:04.280\r\nI know, it's such a strange word,\r\nand I don't come up with this stuff.\r\n\r\n114\r\n00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.810\r\nBut that's something that you'll need to\r\n\r\n115\r\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.130\r\nunderstand those terms if you're trying\r\nto sift to this documentation and\r\n\r\n116\r\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.190\r\nsort out and choose the correct licensing\r\nfor your organization, or your needs.\r\n\r\n117\r\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.420\r\nSo it's also important to\r\nnote that they do restrict,\r\n\r\n118\r\n00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.890\r\nlike I mentioned with\r\nthe processors as well.\r\n\r\n119\r\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.340\r\nSo with that standard edition,\r\n\r\n120\r\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.320\r\nyou get your two VOSEs, you can have\r\nup to two virtual instances there.\r\n\r\n121\r\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.675\r\nAnd it's really designed for those\r\nhighly non virtualized environments and\r\n\r\n122\r\n00:07:33.675 --> 00:07:38.710\r\nthat's really gonna be the main\r\ndifference there between datacenter.\r\n\r\n123\r\n00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.400\r\nYou're not losing out on those features,\r\nso it is important to know that.\r\n\r\n124\r\n00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.149\r\nBut taking a step down, if we take a look,\r\noops, here at our essentials, all right?\r\n\r\n125\r\n00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:52.431\r\nWith essentials, you have the ability to\r\nhave one operating system environment.\r\n\r\n126\r\n00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:55.770\r\nSo, this could be physical or\r\nvirtual there.\r\n\r\n127\r\n00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.552\r\nNow for your server, you still can\r\nhave up to those two processors.\r\n\r\n128\r\n00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:03.180\r\nThere is a 25 user limit here.\r\n\r\n129\r\n00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.640\r\nSo that's pretty important to note,\r\nwe're not talking large organizations.\r\n\r\n130\r\n00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.410\r\nSo that's definitely\r\nsomething to consider,\r\n\r\n131\r\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.530\r\nbut you can see right here the price\r\nwill definitely reflected, as well.\r\n\r\n132\r\n00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.050\r\nSo if you're smaller business,\r\nyou wanna have some of those features, but\r\n\r\n133\r\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.670\r\nyou don't wanna go ahead or\r\nyou can't spend the price tag\r\n\r\n134\r\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.105\r\nthat's associated with that Datacenter\r\nEdition and that would be a good solution.\r\n\r\n135\r\n00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:29.285\r\nNow, the Foundation Edition is\r\nnot always a viable option for\r\n\r\n136\r\n00:08:29.285 --> 00:08:33.835\r\na lot of organizations especially\r\nbecause you can only have that\r\n\r\n137\r\n00:08:33.835 --> 00:08:37.270\r\nFoundation Edition installed\r\non a physical machine.\r\n\r\n138\r\n00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.840\r\nAnd as a matter of fact,\r\n\r\n139\r\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.170\r\nyou won't even be the one installing\r\nit when you received that.\r\n\r\n140\r\n00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:48.280\r\nWhat I mean is, it comes by OEM only,\r\noriginal equipment manufacturer.\r\n\r\n141\r\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.270\r\nSo it's usually pre-installed on a system,\r\non a physical machine.\r\n\r\n142\r\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:59.360\r\nAnd you also have a significant\r\nlimitation of up to 15 users as well.\r\n\r\n143\r\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.740\r\nSo those are some things to consider.\r\n\r\n144\r\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.940\r\nAnd it's kind of interesting when\r\nyou look at this model, just\r\n\r\n145\r\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.454\r\nto know the difference, you may encounter\r\nsome type of scenario based question.\r\n\r\n146\r\n00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:17.730\r\nAnd in this PDF that you will have\r\naccess to here in the attached files,\r\n\r\n147\r\n00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.990\r\nyou might wanna really just\r\nsift through and look at it.\r\n\r\n148\r\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:25.940\r\nThere's a lot to understand and looking\r\neven at that processor limitation here.\r\n\r\n149\r\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.360\r\nLet me just spend a second\r\nto kind of explain\r\n\r\n150\r\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.920\r\nwhat I would talk about in a scenario\r\nbased type of environment.\r\n\r\n151\r\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.251\r\nSo, here you have licensing examples and\r\n\r\n152\r\n00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:38.390\r\nthey tell you about the One 1-processor\r\nand non-virtualized server.\r\n\r\n153\r\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.820\r\nThey're giving you different solutions or\r\nscenarios that you need to understand\r\n\r\n154\r\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.330\r\nwhich licenses would work best for\r\nthat particular scenario.\r\n\r\n155\r\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.110\r\nDown here at the bottom,\r\nlet's take a look at this one.\r\n\r\n156\r\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:55.607\r\nIt says, if you have One 2-processor\r\nserver with 12 virtual OSEs,\r\n\r\n157\r\n00:09:55.607 --> 00:10:00.590\r\nhow many datacenter\r\nlicenses would be required.\r\n\r\n158\r\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.580\r\nSo the big difference here, like I was\r\ntrying to point out between datacenter and\r\n\r\n159\r\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.425\r\nstandard, would be the number\r\nof virtual machines.\r\n\r\n160\r\n00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:10.350\r\nProcessor-wise, that part's\r\ngoing to be the same.\r\n\r\n161\r\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.390\r\nSo you'd only need one data center\r\nlicense for this particular scenario.\r\n\r\n162\r\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:20.510\r\nHowever, you would need\r\nsix standard licenses for\r\n\r\n163\r\n00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.015\r\nthe same scenario because\r\nyou are limited to that two,\r\n\r\n164\r\n00:10:24.015 --> 00:10:30.140\r\ntwo virtual operating system environments\r\nand here they're requesting 12.\r\n\r\n165\r\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.700\r\nSo 12 divided by 2 is 6.\r\n\r\n166\r\n00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.400\r\nJust being able to logically walk through\r\nthat process and understand, that is\r\n\r\n167\r\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.922\r\nreally what they are looking for when they\r\nare talking about this licensing model.\r\n\r\n168\r\n00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:44.060\r\nNow that's not everything that you would\r\nwant to know in a real life practicing\r\n\r\n169\r\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.160\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n170\r\n00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.410\r\nThere is also some really cool\r\n\r\n171\r\n00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.210\r\ntypes of considerations as they go\r\ninto planning here, more in depth.\r\n\r\n172\r\n00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.740\r\nAddition comparisons.\r\n\r\n173\r\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.950\r\nI even have a chart that I\r\nwill share with you guys.\r\n\r\n174\r\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.780\r\nI think it's right here.\r\n\r\n175\r\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.550\r\nAnd it's way too small\r\nto cover on this screen.\r\n\r\n176\r\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.940\r\nBut I am attaching them as well.\r\n\r\n177\r\n00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.610\r\nThis is like a really deep dive into the\r\ndifferent features that are available with\r\n\r\n178\r\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.770\r\nthe different editions there, so that's\r\ngood to just take a look at as well.\r\n\r\n179\r\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.395\r\nAnd scrolling down,\r\nwe look at something else.\r\n\r\n180\r\n00:11:18.395 --> 00:11:20.570\r\nIt's called Software Assurance Benefits.\r\n\r\n181\r\n00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.010\r\nNow, this isn't going to be for everyone.\r\n\r\n182\r\n00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.940\r\nIt's kind of like a road side\r\nassistance where if you are utilizing\r\n\r\n183\r\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.760\r\nthe Microsoft volume licensing,\r\nyou have the ability to go ahead and\r\n\r\n184\r\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.180\r\npurchase Software Assurance Benefits for\r\n\r\n185\r\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.110\r\ntelephone support and support for the\r\nAzure Fabric, if you're utilizing that.\r\n\r\n186\r\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.500\r\nBut just know that it is an option if\r\nyou want that additional support there.\r\n\r\n187\r\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.790\r\nAll right and what's next?\r\n\r\n188\r\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.381\r\nSo definitely take a look at that PDF.\r\n\r\n189\r\n00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:56.063\r\nThere are couple other additions\r\nthat I wanna point out that\r\n\r\n190\r\n00:11:56.063 --> 00:11:59.450\r\nare not the four main standard editions.\r\n\r\n191\r\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.500\r\nOr I really shouldn't use the name\r\nstandard, but the four popular editions.\r\n\r\n192\r\n00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.760\r\nThere are some specific editions.\r\n\r\n193\r\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.054\r\nOne is going to be your Hyper-V server.\r\n\r\n194\r\n00:12:09.054 --> 00:12:15.220\r\nAnd Hyper-V is really designed for\r\na virtualization production environment.\r\n\r\n195\r\n00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.090\r\nSo as a matter of fact, Microsoft\r\noffers this particular addition for\r\n\r\n196\r\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.130\r\nfree on their site.\r\n\r\n197\r\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.890\r\nSo if you go to our evaluation center, you\r\ncan go ahead and download that for free.\r\n\r\n198\r\n00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:32.385\r\nAnd Microsoft's recommendation is that\r\nyou only run, you run this particular\r\n\r\n199\r\n00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:36.545\r\nedition if you're running virtual\r\nmachines, so that would be a great way.\r\n\r\n200\r\n00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:40.175\r\nIt has a smaller footprint for\r\nyou to go ahead and run them.\r\n\r\n201\r\n00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:45.512\r\nAnother one is going to be\r\nWindows Storage Server 2012 R2 and\r\n\r\n202\r\n00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:49.742\r\nthat is going to be a really designed for\r\nstoring files and\r\n\r\n203\r\n00:12:49.742 --> 00:12:53.112\r\nusing it as centralized file storage.\r\n\r\n204\r\n00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:57.260\r\nAnd then lastly there's one additional\r\nwhich is our Windows Multipoint server.\r\n\r\n205\r\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.660\r\nAnd if you think back, some of you\r\nwho may have been working in IT for\r\n\r\n206\r\n00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.650\r\na while, we used to call this\r\nlike our terminal server.\r\n\r\n207\r\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.560\r\nSo if you're utilizing remote desktop and\r\nyou have a lot of machines connecting to\r\n\r\n208\r\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.580\r\nthat one operating system, then that\r\nwould be a good solution for you.\r\n\r\n209\r\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.260\r\nNow there is a caveat to that.\r\n\r\n210\r\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.150\r\nIf you think about that licensing model\r\nthat we just covered, you're not gonna be\r\n\r\n211\r\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.710\r\nable to escape by with only paying for one\r\noperating system if you have multiple end\r\n\r\n212\r\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.300\r\nusers like a hundred end users connecting\r\nto that machine or however many.\r\n\r\n213\r\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.730\r\nSo you would also need to think about\r\nadditional licensing which is called CALs,\r\n\r\n214\r\n00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.860\r\nClient Access Licensing and\r\nthose can be on a per user,\r\n\r\n215\r\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.150\r\nper machine base type of access\r\nto make sure that you're not\r\n\r\n216\r\n00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.820\r\nskirting any kind of\r\nlicensing obligations there.\r\n\r\n217\r\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.240\r\nYou wanna make sure that\r\nyou're in compliance so\r\n\r\n218\r\n00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.580\r\nthat if you ever get audited, which\r\nyou do have the ability to get audited\r\n\r\n219\r\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.160\r\nby Microsoft because this is a paid\r\nproducts that we're talking about here.\r\n\r\n220\r\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.350\r\nSo you just wanna be aware of that.\r\n\r\n221\r\n00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.370\r\nAlright, Roni I think we also need to talk\r\nabout some old system requirements right?\r\n\r\n222\r\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.712\r\n&gt;&gt; Right.\r\n&gt;&gt; Because this is also\r\n\r\n223\r\n00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:08.660\r\nimportant when you're thinking\r\nabout planning your environment.\r\n\r\n224\r\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.500\r\nYou wanna make sure that you\r\nhave the hardware to be able\r\n\r\n225\r\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.560\r\nto support what you have going on.\r\n\r\n226\r\n00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.330\r\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\r\n\r\n227\r\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:22.160\r\nThere really three essential components\r\nthat we really need to focus on.\r\n\r\n228\r\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.780\r\nNumber one, is gonna be the processor.\r\n\r\n229\r\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:29.280\r\nYou need to have at least a 1.4\r\ngigahertz and of course 64-bit.\r\n\r\n230\r\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.770\r\nLike I had mentioned.\r\n\r\n231\r\n00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.850\r\nWe're talking about\r\na 64-bit architecture for\r\n\r\n232\r\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.640\r\nboth additions 2000, 2000 R2 and all of\r\nthe additions that we spoke about here.\r\n\r\n233\r\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.930\r\nSo let's just be clear on that.\r\n\r\n234\r\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.658\r\nNow, RAM, this is a funny one here guys.\r\n\r\n235\r\n00:14:45.658 --> 00:14:51.380\r\nSo this is gonna be your minimum and I\r\nsay, this is definitely the minimum here.\r\n\r\n236\r\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:57.220\r\nThey're not being generous or\r\nkind of overcompensating or whatsoever.\r\n\r\n237\r\n00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.820\r\nThe operating system will run.\r\n\r\n238\r\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.440\r\nHow well will it run?\r\n\r\n239\r\n00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.180\r\nEspecially if you think about any kind of\r\nadditional roles, features, third party\r\n\r\n240\r\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.190\r\nsoftware that you're gonna be installing,\r\nyou will need to consider that as well.\r\n\r\n241\r\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.890\r\nBut that's the minimum, 512 megabytes.\r\n\r\n242\r\n00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.280\r\nAnother important factor here.\r\n\r\n243\r\n00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.440\r\nLet me just zoom out.\r\n\r\n244\r\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.490\r\nIs going to be our disk space requirements\r\nand this is just as important to\r\n\r\n245\r\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.300\r\nunderstand that this is again, that bare\r\nminimum here for 32 GB worth of storage.\r\n\r\n246\r\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.814\r\nYou always have to consider what you're\r\ngonna be using that machine for and\r\n\r\n247\r\n00:15:34.814 --> 00:15:39.433\r\nif you increase the RAM up to more\r\nthan 16 GB, you're also gonna need to\r\n\r\n248\r\n00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:44.613\r\nincrease this disk space for your paging\r\nfile, your system reserve partition.\r\n\r\n249\r\n00:15:44.613 --> 00:15:46.798\r\nSo there are a lot of\r\nthings to consider and\r\n\r\n250\r\n00:15:46.798 --> 00:15:50.370\r\nthat's also part of the planning\r\nwhen you're setting up a server.\r\n\r\n251\r\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.910\r\nIs this going to be a dedicated server?\r\n\r\n252\r\n00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.940\r\nAm I gonna be hosting multiple roles?\r\n\r\n253\r\n00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.249\r\nDo I have multiple connections?\r\n\r\n254\r\n00:15:56.249 --> 00:16:00.110\r\nSo it's always gonna be\r\nunique to your project.\r\n\r\n255\r\n00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.160\r\nFor instance, how many network\r\ninterface cards am I gonna have?\r\n\r\n256\r\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.540\r\nAm I gonna be using NIC teaming?\r\n\r\n257\r\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.630\r\nSo these are all things to consider, but\r\n\r\n258\r\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.430\r\nMicrosoft really calls out those\r\nthree system requirements.\r\n\r\n259\r\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.930\r\nWhich are also gonna be the exact same for\r\nServer Core, so\r\n\r\n260\r\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.020\r\nthat's kind of a plus when you're\r\nstudying for your exam there.\r\n\r\n261\r\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.005\r\nAlthough Server Core does have a smaller\r\nfootprint, they call out the same system\r\n\r\n262\r\n00:16:20.005 --> 00:16:23.120\r\nrequirements, so that's\r\nan interesting fact to know as well.\r\n\r\n263\r\n00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.960\r\nAll right,\r\nlooking at our memory limitations,\r\n\r\n264\r\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.730\r\nI think this is pretty cool too.\r\n\r\n265\r\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.790\r\nIf you just kind of take a journey,\r\nyou know a trip in time here,\r\n\r\n266\r\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.740\r\nlet me see,\r\nI don't wanna scroll you guys to death.\r\n\r\n267\r\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.560\r\nBut it's kind of neat to see where\r\nwe started and where we're going.\r\n\r\n268\r\n00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.590\r\nWe're not gonna focus too much on 2016,\r\nthere's a show for that.\r\n\r\n269\r\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.690\r\nBut, here even looking at Server 2008,\r\nright?\r\n\r\n270\r\n00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:55.190\r\nWe have approximately on most\r\neditions 1 terabyte limitation for\r\n\r\n271\r\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.276\r\nthe maximum amount of memory that\r\ncan be installed in this system.\r\n\r\n272\r\n00:16:58.276 --> 00:17:03.210\r\nMoving forward, to Server 2008 R2,\r\n\r\n273\r\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:09.440\r\nyou can see we about double up there and\r\neven 2 terabytes of memory max.\r\n\r\n274\r\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.380\r\nAnd moving forward in time, so with\r\nServer 2012, we're really looking at here\r\n\r\n275\r\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.565\r\nfor the larger editions, the enterprise\r\neditions here, data centered and standard.\r\n\r\n276\r\n00:17:20.565 --> 00:17:24.110\r\n4 terabytes worth of memory,\r\nso that's pretty impressive.\r\n\r\n277\r\n00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.310\r\nAgain, 2016, with each version,\r\n\r\n278\r\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:30.140\r\neach enhancement,\r\nwe're trying to grow and get better but\r\n\r\n279\r\n00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.890\r\nthat's just nice to know there for\r\nyour theoretical limitations for memory.\r\n\r\n280\r\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:41.480\r\nAnd it is also important to point out\r\nthat we talk about our versions and\r\n\r\n281\r\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.090\r\ntrying to add features,\r\nsecurity enhancements,\r\n\r\n282\r\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.170\r\nwhen Server 2012 was first rolled out,\r\nit was great.\r\n\r\n283\r\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:54.690\r\nIt had a lot of cool features that\r\n2008 R2 didn't have to offer, but\r\n\r\n284\r\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:00.630\r\nagain with most other operating systems\r\nand software it did have a version two,\r\n\r\n285\r\n00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.420\r\nso that's going to be Server 2008 R2.\r\n\r\n286\r\n00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.120\r\nWith R2 we saw a lot of different\r\nfeatures being enabled and added.\r\n\r\n287\r\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.070\r\nAnd if we take a look at my screen here,\r\n\r\n288\r\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.420\r\nI also will share this with you,\r\nit's a list.\r\n\r\n289\r\n00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.950\r\nAnd it's a laundry list of\r\na lot of different things.\r\n\r\n290\r\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:23.680\r\nAuthentication enhancements, but\r\nmost notably we're talking desired state\r\n\r\n291\r\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.130\r\nconfiguration was added, work folders,\r\nthere's just a lot of different\r\n\r\n292\r\n00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:34.030\r\nreally cool features, additional\r\nvirtualization Linux support integrated.\r\n\r\n293\r\n00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.370\r\nSo, that's definitely something to\r\nconsider if your organization is looking\r\n\r\n294\r\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.560\r\nfor a particular feature, make sure\r\nyou're choosing the right edition.\r\n\r\n295\r\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.640\r\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, I just wanna make sure\r\nthat we corrected this right away here.\r\n\r\n296\r\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.895\r\nShe did say Server 2008 R2\r\neven in describing that,\r\n\r\n297\r\n00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:53.280\r\nbut she did mean Server 2012 R2.\r\n\r\n298\r\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.880\r\n&gt;&gt; Did I [LAUGH]?\r\n\r\n299\r\n00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.390\r\n&gt;&gt; So if you, yeah, if you heard that cuz\r\nI was listening I was she described that\r\n\r\n300\r\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.830\r\nthere was an upgrade but remember\r\nthat you do need to understand that.\r\n\r\n301\r\n00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.390\r\nAnd this particular show without Cherokee,\r\n\r\n302\r\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.160\r\nwe're basing everything\r\naround server 2012 R2, right?\r\n\r\n303\r\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.880\r\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so if I do, and\r\nguys just forgive me up front,\r\n\r\n304\r\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.790\r\nI'll put in a little disclaimer\r\nright away, if I say server 2012,\r\n\r\n305\r\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.560\r\ncumulatively speaking I'm mostly likely\r\ntalking about Server 2012 R2 because\r\n\r\n306\r\n00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.010\r\nthat's the newer version of the two.\r\n\r\n307\r\n00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.760\r\nSo from here on out on this show,\r\nthat's what we'll really be working with\r\n\r\n308\r\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.900\r\nwhenever we're looking at hands on\r\nactivities and digging in there.\r\n\r\n309\r\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.240\r\nSo I think that's a good place\r\nto ahead and get started.\r\n\r\n310\r\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.480\r\nI know it's a lot of information for\r\nyou to absorb, but\r\n\r\n311\r\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.690\r\nwe've got some really cool\r\nfeatures headed your way, so\r\n\r\n312\r\n00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.910\r\nI can't wait to get started\r\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, thank you again for\r\n\r\n313\r\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.376\r\nhelping us out with this idea of\r\nplanning for a server installation.\r\n\r\n314\r\n00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:51.540\r\nNow that we took look at the different\r\nadditions that we have available to us\r\n\r\n315\r\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.390\r\nwith Server 2012 R2, and this is gonna be\r\nimportant when choosing the right one for\r\n\r\n316\r\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.400\r\nyour particular business model\r\nthat you need to follow.\r\n\r\n317\r\n00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.980\r\nThe scenario that Cherokee\r\ngave us is something\r\n\r\n318\r\n00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.980\r\nthat we want to make sure we understand,\r\nespecially gefore going into the exam.\r\n\r\n319\r\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.840\r\nDo not be surprised if you see\r\na question or two on that,\r\n\r\n320\r\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.100\r\nlike which of the following would\r\nyou actually choose for this?\r\n\r\n321\r\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.500\r\nNow you do have to plan for\r\nthings that you might hear as well,\r\n\r\n322\r\n00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.200\r\nwhich is of course scalability\r\nis kinda the big thing so\r\n\r\n323\r\n00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.200\r\ndon't just limit yourself to one and\r\ngoing this will fit perfectly.\r\n\r\n324\r\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.983\r\nEspecially if they're asking for\r\nscaling and\r\n\r\n325\r\n00:20:24.983 --> 00:20:27.740\r\nyou might have that kind of jump\r\nup to the next edition as well.\r\n\r\n326\r\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.980\r\nAnd then of course, knowing the system\r\nrequirements that we have available,\r\n\r\n327\r\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.130\r\nthat's also gonna be a help as well.\r\n\r\n328\r\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.985\r\nBut that means we are now ready to get\r\nstarted on the installation of Server, but\r\n\r\n329\r\n00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:40.465\r\nthat's gonna be for another episode then.\r\n\r\n330\r\n00:20:40.465 --> 00:20:44.555\r\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\r\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\r\n\r\n331\r\n00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:45.685\r\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\r\n\r\n332\r\n00:20:45.685 --> 00:20:51.337\r\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\r\nmore of the MCSA 70-410

00:00:08.520\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.920\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.858\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:19.408\nYou're watching\nthe MCSA Windows Server 2012 show for\n\n7\n00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:24.152\nthe exam 70-410 which I could\nnow remember right then.\n\n8\n00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:27.624\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\nwe are now getting ready, right.\n\n9\n00:00:27.624 --> 00:00:29.078\nWe've talked about planning a little bit.\n\n10\n00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:34.024\nWe are now getting ready to install\nthe Window Server inside or\n\n11\n00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:35.843\nusing the GUI as well.\n\n12\n00:00:35.843 --> 00:00:38.525\nAnd here to help us out is\ngonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:40.535\nCherokee, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:41.109\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing awesome.\n\n15\n00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.855\nThank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.807\nAnd yeah, we're really gonna be taking\na look at something that we talked about,\n\n17\n00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:50.031\nthose four additions,\nthose main additions that we spoke about.\n\n18\n00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:53.095\nAll four of them offer\na graphical user interface.\n\n19\n00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.880\nSo I think this is\na perfect place to start.\n\n20\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.939\nOur two larger enterprise editions,\n\n21\n00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.474\nand I I need to kind of shift away\nfrom using that word enterprise,\n\n22\n00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:05.099\nbecause I don't wanna make you\nthink that those are the two terms.\n\n23\n00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.288\nIt's data center and\nstandard edition which are used for\n\n24\n00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:10.270\nenterprise environments.\n\n25\n00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.180\nSo those two, additions,\nversions offer the ability to\n\n26\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.240\nkind of flip flop back on forth between\na GUI a graphical user interface.\n\n27\n00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.027\nAs well as a core edition, which\nwe'll be looking at in a few moments.\n\n28\n00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:26.471\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nyou just said something, and\n\n29\n00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:28.610\nlet me make sure that I\nunderstand what you said.\n\n30\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.011\nYou said, we have the ability to flip flop\nbetween them, what do you mean by that?\n\n31\n00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:36.326\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, prior to server 2012,\nwhen you were planning in,\n\n32\n00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:39.872\neven in older versions of\nnetwork operating systems,\n\n33\n00:01:39.872 --> 00:01:43.899\nyou really had to make a decision,\na choice on that platform.\n\n34\n00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.306\nAnd architecture because there was\nno going back once it was done then\n\n35\n00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:47.960\nthat was it.\n\n36\n00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.247\nYou would have to do a full blown blow\nout of that system and reinstall, but\n\n37\n00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:56.549\nwe don't really see that,\nwe don't see that here with Server 2012.\n\n38\n00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.427\nWhere we have the ability to go ahead and\n\n39\n00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:04.775\nremove that graphical shell to let's say,\n\n40\n00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:11.730\nI feel like this particular machine\nis over, or is under-utilized.\n\n41\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.970\nSo I have more resources for\nthis machine that I'm really using.\n\n42\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.500\nSo If it's a being, I can go ahead and\nsay, hey, you know what, this machine\n\n43\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.730\nwould actually perform better if I\nbring it down to core, or if I provide.\n\n44\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.720\nIt really all depends on\nthe customer's needs.\n\n45\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.410\nSo maybe someone in your environment,\nyour network admins,\n\n46\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.450\nfeel more comfortable using\nthose graphical tool sets.\n\n47\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.970\nSo they have the ability to swap back and\nforth.\n\n48\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.320\nSo maybe getting it spun up, configured\nyou'd wanna use those graphical tools.\n\n49\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.123\nBut during a production environment, you\ncould bring it back down to core, remove\n\n50\n00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:50.806\nthe graphical components, and run it in\nproduction as just that core instance.\n\n51\n00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:54.262\nThere's a lot of reasons why you might\nwanna do that well number one like I said\n\n52\n00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:55.960\nfor hardware utilization.\n\n53\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.860\nI can fit more especially if\nwe're talking about machines\n\n54\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.640\nI can fit more virtual machines,\n\n55\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.200\non server core instance than I could with\nthat full blown graphical user interface.\n\n56\n00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.680\nIt also reduces the amount of\nupdates that I have to have.\n\n57\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.570\nWith all additional coding that you\nhave in the GUI you're gonna be seeing\n\n58\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.052\nmore updates than you would within\nthe course about the management there.\n\n59\n00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:21.253\nAnd you'll also have a small\nof foot print when we\n\n60\n00:03:21.253 --> 00:03:24.923\nare utilizing the core because\nthere's less coding and\n\n61\n00:03:24.923 --> 00:03:30.626\ncoding is not that it's it's we that there\nare vulnerabilities including in coding so\n\n62\n00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:33.618\nthere is less of chance\nof attack occurring.\n\n63\n00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:37.912\nSo that's something you wanna consider say\nyeah we do have the ability to be able\n\n64\n00:03:37.912 --> 00:03:40.042\nto jump up foot from both those styles.\n\n65\n00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:43.125\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee now that\nwe've gone though the planning and\n\n66\n00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:46.890\nwe've selected that scenario and\nwe've chosen what we gonna do.\n\n67\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.473\nWhat is our next step in\nthe installation process?\n\n68\n00:03:49.473 --> 00:03:52.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, I also wanna mention\nthat there is an in between.\n\n69\n00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.770\nSo, I know that I just told\nyou that there's two different\n\n70\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.500\nstyles that we can flip-flop from.\n\n71\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.561\nBut, we'll also in this show,\ntake a look at that in between there.\n\n72\n00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:02.270\nAnd that's going to be our\nminimal server interface.\n\n73\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.738\nSo, let's say,\nI like some of those graphical utilities,\n\n74\n00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:09.614\nI don't wanna full fledged GUI system,\nand I only need few of them,\n\n75\n00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:11.936\nI do have the ability to pick and choose.\n\n76\n00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:15.007\nWell, somewhat,\nMicrosoft chooses for me and\n\n77\n00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.247\noffers me that\nMinimal Server Interface option.\n\n78\n00:04:18.247 --> 00:04:23.318\nWith Minimal Server Interface, I'm still\ngonna have access to server manager if I'm\n\n79\n00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:28.650\nalready comfortable and acclimated with\nusing that graphical tool there, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.939\nI also have access to your MMCs, which is\nreally nice because a lot of different,\n\n81\n00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:39.206\nI can utilize MMCs to manage\na lot of services like DNS.\n\n82\n00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:43.612\nOr maybe I'm already acclimated to the\nlayout of that, and I'm not so familiar\n\n83\n00:04:43.612 --> 00:04:47.910\nwith all the PowerShell commands and\ncmdlets and modules that are out there.\n\n84\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.847\nSo, it's a great stepping stone, actually.\n\n85\n00:04:51.847 --> 00:04:56.406\nAnd then the last thing that our\nminimal server interface offers us is\n\n86\n00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:58.220\na subset of Control Panel.\n\n87\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.100\nSo some of those graphical\ncomponents are there.\n\n88\n00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.864\nYou're not working with a completely\nremoved graphical shell.\n\n89\n00:05:03.864 --> 00:05:05.657\nSo you do have that ability and\n\n90\n00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:09.470\njust now that your full graphical\nshell will be providing you.\n\n91\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.457\nSo what that shell brings to the table,\nis going to be that full desktop your\n\n92\n00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:18.665\nstart screen, Windows Explorer and\nalso Internet Explorer.\n\n93\n00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:23.469\nSo that's what your shell provides you,\nand we'll take a look at how we\n\n94\n00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:28.116\ncan go ahead and use PowerShell to\ndifferentiate which level of GUI so\n\n95\n00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:30.298\nto speak that we wanna be using.\n\n96\n00:05:30.298 --> 00:05:33.609\nSo, without further ado let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen and\n\n97\n00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:36.430\nwe'll go ahead and\nsee how we would set that up.\n\n98\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.168\nThere're a couple of different\nplaces where you can go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:43.020\nobtain this ISO, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.797\nSo I'm using Hyper-V,\na virtualized instance,\n\n101\n00:05:45.797 --> 00:05:49.491\nbecause that's just how I'm running\nthis on my laptop right here.\n\n102\n00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:54.951\nSo I just pulled the ISO image off\nMicrosoft's Technet eval center.\n\n103\n00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:55.880\nAnd you know what?\n\n104\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.500\nI don't have it pulled up here,\nbut it will only take a second.\n\n105\n00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.770\nIf we just say Server 2012, R2 eval,\n\n106\n00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.678\ndownload There's a couple\nthings that you'll need to\n\n107\n00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:10.855\ndo in order to obtain this but\nit's pretty cool.\n\n108\n00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:13.205\nYou get to try this for 180 days, so\n\n109\n00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:18.205\nit's definitely worth the time to just\nfill out this little registration form,\n\n110\n00:06:18.205 --> 00:06:22.783\nit asks you for some basic information,\nyour name, your email address.\n\n111\n00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:25.237\nAnd then, you're able to go ahead and\ndownload.\n\n112\n00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:27.527\nYou have a couple different options for\nthe downloading,\n\n113\n00:06:27.527 --> 00:06:30.437\nyou can download it with the ISO,\nwhich is what I'll be showing you here.\n\n114\n00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:35.354\nBut if you are using virtualization, they\nalso offer those virtual hard disks for\n\n115\n00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:36.860\nyou to download as well.\n\n116\n00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.201\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n117\n00:06:38.201 --> 00:06:41.775\nThere're different versions.\n\n118\n00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:46.310\nThat's 2016 there, but you do have\nthe essentials, and Hyper-V, and\n\n119\n00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.333\nthat's all here within\nthat Technet eval center.\n\n120\n00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:53.481\nBut we're gonna just be working with\nthe regular, standard edition for\n\n121\n00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:54.440\nthis demo here.\n\n122\n00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.412\nAll right, so I'm just gonna go ahead and\nspin a up new virtual machine.\n\n123\n00:07:00.412 --> 00:07:04.298\nAnd if you've never worked with Hyper-V\nbefore, then woo you're in the right\n\n124\n00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:08.500\nplace because we're definitely be gonna\nbe covering that a little bit later.\n\n125\n00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.776\nSo we're just gonna go ahead and\nname this demo for right now.\n\n126\n00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:14.963\n[COUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n127\n00:07:14.963 --> 00:07:19.971\nI know I'm going through this pretty fast,\nbut that's okay I\n\n128\n00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:25.590\njust want to get this pulled up for\nus, and let me change, okay.\n\n129\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.898\nMaking sure this is on the right drive.\n\n130\n00:07:26.898 --> 00:07:31.754\nSo, [LAUGH] If you notice here, I'm\ncreating this virtual disk at this point\n\n131\n00:07:31.754 --> 00:07:34.508\nand I'm running through this previously.\n\n132\n00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:36.860\nI have two hard drives in my laptop.\n\n133\n00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.943\nI have a spindle drive and\nI have a solid-state drive, so\n\n134\n00:07:39.943 --> 00:07:42.832\nI'm gonna go ahead and\npoint this to my faster drive so\n\n135\n00:07:42.832 --> 00:07:46.001\nwe're not sitting here taking\nforever in this demo here.\n\n136\n00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:51.226\nAnd here I'm just pointing to that\nimage that I had downloaded here.\n\n137\n00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:56.867\nSo, this is 2012R2 we're gonna be\nrunning for our 64-bit edition.\n\n138\n00:07:58.943 --> 00:08:01.483\nAnd finish, all right.\n\n139\n00:08:01.483 --> 00:08:06.169\nSo what I simulating here is where\nessentially by pointing to that iso,\n\n140\n00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:11.420\nit's like I'm opening that tray and\nplacing the disk in and closing that tray.\n\n141\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.430\nSo if I had a physical machine that's\nessentially what I'm doing right here.\n\n142\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.880\nSo we can see this demo machine.\n\n143\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.210\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nconnect to this and pull it up.\n\n144\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.540\nAnd if I hit this button,\nthis start button right here,\n\n145\n00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.550\nI'm essentially powering\non my physical machine.\n\n146\n00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.930\nIf I were working on a physical machine.\n\n147\n00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.470\nAnd this is what you guys would be seeing.\n\n148\n00:08:36.446 --> 00:08:38.431\nI'll try and\nzoom out here a little bit for us.\n\n149\n00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:44.851\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what we're actually\nseeing on the screen, of course, is just\n\n150\n00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:49.251\na regular install that we would normally\nhave if we really had the physical media,\n\n151\n00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:53.310\nthe DVD, that we had burned that ISO\nto and had put it into the tray.\n\n152\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.190\nHere Cherokee has virtualized it and\n\n153\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.600\nnow that she's put it in, now we are at\nthe install screen of what we see here.\n\n154\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is going to be\nthe first page that you see and\n\n155\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.580\nit's gonna be asking you what language.\n\n156\n00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.450\nSo it's kind of interesting.\n\n157\n00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.010\nAll the different languages\nthat they have to offer, but\n\n158\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.630\nI'm just gonna select United States for\nthis particular download, this eval copy.\n\n159\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.490\nBut you could also have a lot of\ndifferent options here obviously.\n\n160\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.650\nBut we're just gonna go ahead and\nrun with the defaults.\n\n161\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:25.910\nWe're gonna hit next, and then you\nhave the install page that pops up,\n\n162\n00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.080\nthere's an option down here\nat the bottom left corner.\n\n163\n00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.810\nLet me see here I'm kind of stuck in my\nvirtualization environment a little bit.\n\n164\n00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.570\nI need to zoom out.\n\n165\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.030\nApparently my keyboard shortcuts aren't\nworking, let me just move that over.\n\n166\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.760\nSo what you see in this bottom left-hand\ncorner is an option to repair your\n\n167\n00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.980\ncomputer, if you wanted to go ahead and\nutilize the integrated repair utilities.\n\n168\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.390\nBut for now, we're just gonna\nhit that Install in the center.\n\n169\n00:09:53.354 --> 00:09:57.010\nAnd Setup is starting, it'll just to\nload through the different files.\n\n170\n00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:03.480\nAnd it's not a lengthy process here, it's\ncome a long way than what it used to be.\n\n171\n00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.983\nSo, Sorry,\nnot trying to give you guys whiplash here,\n\n172\n00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:11.600\nbut I want you to be able to see\nsomething that's kind of interesting.\n\n173\n00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.710\nIf I pull this out a little bit, you'll\nnotice that the default installation here\n\n174\n00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:22.090\nis gonna be Windows Server 2012 R2\nStandard Evaluation Server core install.\n\n175\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.010\nSo Microsoft is really trying\nto push that core installation.\n\n176\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.460\nThose great benefits that I just told you,\nwhy we would wanna go ahead and\n\n177\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.350\ninstall core.\n\n178\n00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.240\nThat's kind of the way of the future,\nyou just get more bang for\n\n179\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.140\nyour buck, more ROI if you're utilizing\nthat for production environment.\n\n180\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.660\nBut here we wanna work with our GUI,\n\n181\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.870\nso we're gonna make sure we select,\nServer with a GUI.\n\n182\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.030\nNow, with Server 2016,\nagain like I mentioned,\n\n183\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.370\nthey like to change terminology\non you a little bit.\n\n184\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.780\nSo it'll say Server with\ndesktop experience.\n\n185\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.410\nIt's just the same concept,\ndifferent term, that's all.\n\n186\n00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.369\nSo we'll hit Next.\n\n187\n00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.540\nAlright now, for\n\n188\n00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.600\nour ULA, this is our end of licenses\nagreement, you have the option to,\n\n189\n00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.580\nwell, comply and accept these terms or\nto not install the software.\n\n190\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.050\nAnd of course, we are going to read\nthrough every thing that's noted\n\n191\n00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.929\nhere in our ULA and agree to those terms,\nand we'll hit next.\n\n192\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.610\nNow for this particular option,\n\n193\n00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.920\nwe have the ability to select an upgrade,\nwhich we will talk about in a later show.\n\n194\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.138\nBut for now, we're gonna go ahead and\nselect Custom for our install.\n\n195\n00:11:34.855 --> 00:11:40.204\nAnd we also have the ability to really\ncustomize our hard drives as well,\n\n196\n00:11:40.204 --> 00:11:44.413\nso l am just gonna leave\nthe default here for 127 gigs,\n\n197\n00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:49.938\neverything stored on one, and you know\nit's seems like in a past running,\n\n198\n00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:54.937\nit was kind of customary to have\na separate partition for storage but\n\n199\n00:11:54.937 --> 00:12:00.815\nwith the advance of different storage\ntechniques and redundancies that we have\n\n200\n00:12:00.815 --> 00:12:06.338\ntoday It’s not as big of a deal if your\nsystem is seeing any kind of malware or\n\n201\n00:12:06.338 --> 00:12:11.820\ncorruption because you normally have\nbackups and kind of a plan B in mind.\n\n202\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.866\nSo I'm just going to\nkeep these defaults but\n\n203\n00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:16.966\nyou could create additional partitions,\nreformat that drive but\n\n204\n00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:19.853\nwe're just going to hit next and\nkeep these defaults for now.\n\n205\n00:12:24.229 --> 00:12:27.633\nAll right, so this is probably going\nto be the screen that takes the longest\n\n206\n00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:30.875\ntime here and it should take us about\nfive minutes with the hardware that\n\n207\n00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.460\nI've allocated to this machine.\n\n208\n00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.800\nAnd what we're doing is just seeing these\ninstallation files being set up and\n\n209\n00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.040\nrunning through.\n\n210\n00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:43.060\nBut this is really the the longest part\nof your install that you should see here.\n\n211\n00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, during this point, right,\nas you're getting ready to do this, right,\n\n212\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.270\nit used to be in a process especially\non earlier editions and, of course,\n\n213\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.210\neven with the slower hardware that this is\nwhere you would get to that point and go.\n\n214\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.700\nLet me go and do something else for\n\n215\n00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.390\n15 minutes-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n216\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.180\n&gt;&gt; Half an hour or an hour-\n&gt;&gt; Time management.\n\n217\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.210\n&gt;&gt; Or two hours\n&gt;&gt; To be able to do that, but\n\n218\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.630\nbecause Cherokee chose the faster\ndrive on her computer,\n\n219\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.780\nit's really gonna reduce that\ntime on the install very quickly.\n\n220\n00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.820\nAnd this is something that Windows\nhas been working on over years,\n\n221\n00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.570\nregardless of whatever\nthe operating system was,\n\n222\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.490\nwhether it was a server edition,\nwhether it was the desktop edition,\n\n223\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.200\nto reduce that time of the install,\nso that we could proceed and\n\n224\n00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.390\nbecome more productive with\nthe time that we have available.\n\n225\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.070\nBut, we do need to warn you now.\n\n226\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.300\nRight?\nIf you're saying well,\n\n227\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.210\nI don't have a solid state drive to to\ninstall this on I'm gonna follow along.\n\n228\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.730\nWell your is gonna take maybe\nconsiderably longer before this happens.\n\n229\n00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.060\nSo don't think that it's\nmistake on your part or\n\n230\n00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.820\nthat there's something wrong\nwith the image that you have.\n\n231\n00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.890\nMore than likely, it is just\nbecause it's having translate or\n\n232\n00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.200\ntransferred, excuse me.\n\n233\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.970\nWhatever was loaded into you RAM and now\nhas to write that down to your hard drive\n\n234\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.750\nwhich now the slowest component\nInside of your server.\n\n235\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.660\nAnd remember that regular servers, right,\nas far as the hardware goes, when you\n\n236\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.420\nreboot it, if you're actually using a real\nphysical server, it may go a lot faster.\n\n237\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.580\nBut the reboot time's gonna take a lot\nlonger cuz there's a lot more things\n\n238\n00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.660\nthat has to kind of\nconfigure along the way.\n\n239\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.800\nBut right now, Cherokee is just showing\nus at least the basic installation of\n\n240\n00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.960\nwhat we're normally seeing.\n\n241\n00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.680\n&gt;&gt; You're right, Ronnie.\n\n242\n00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.900\nAnd although Microsoft doesn't call\nout additional information for\n\n243\n00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.620\nthat hardware requirements, like you said,\nif you're using a regular drive,\n\n244\n00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.070\nlike a spindle optical drive,\nthe RPM's for\n\n245\n00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.740\nthat particular hard drive\nare going to make a difference.\n\n246\n00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.900\nSo if you're working in\na production environment,\n\n247\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.880\nthere are different levels of hard drives.\n\n248\n00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.170\nYou want to make sure you're getting- I\nwant to make sure- at least 7,200 RPM's.\n\n249\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.640\nAnd of course,\nthey have different- Western Digital.\n\n250\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.520\nI don't even remember all of\nthe different- they have their little,\n\n251\n00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.980\ntheir names for them for the,\n&gt;&gt; So now you're gonna make people and\n\n252\n00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.840\nchoose which hardware,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.799\n&gt;&gt; That they need, [CROSSTALK]\n\n254\n00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:49.455\n&gt;&gt; I don't have a preference here.\n\n255\n00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; It's whatever works for\n\n256\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.240\nyour environment,\nwhatever your budget allows for.\n\n257\n00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.400\nThat's the big key here.\n\n258\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.610\nSo, all right, so\nit will just take a minute there.\n\n259\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.900\nI will note, whenever I installed this,\none thing didn't pop up.\n\n260\n00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.880\nAnd you're probably thinking,\n\n261\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.430\nhey, why didn't she have to put in\nany kind of key for a licensing.\n\n262\n00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:11.540\nThat's because I did get that Eval version\nwhich is offered for 180 days for free.\n\n263\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.570\nIf you had the the disk and\nyou didn't have a key.\n\n264\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:21.360\nYou could also get an Eval key to use to\nkind of test out the operating system\n\n265\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.980\nwhich is called a K.M.S. Key and that link\nare provided in the show notes as well.\n\n266\n00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.000\nBut again, that's not going to be\nsomething that you can rely on because you\n\n267\n00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.540\ndo need to purchase the actual correct\nlicensing like we spoke about so.\n\n268\n00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just to know that the keys that\nyou'll see in that link that Cherokee is\n\n269\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.870\ngonna provide for you, It will get you\npast at least that screen that says,\n\n270\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.630\nyou need to enter in a key there.\n\n271\n00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.580\nBut it's not gonna be available for it to\nbecome an active or an activated product.\n\n272\n00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.220\nThat's what I was trying to say here.\n\n273\n00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.735\nWhich means it's gonna be valid for use.\n\n274\n00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:56.587\nIt will allow you to continue on to a\ncertain point, but that's pretty much it.\n\n275\n00:15:56.587 --> 00:15:59.252\nIt won't be considered an activated copy.\n\n276\n00:15:59.252 --> 00:16:02.931\nSo what you'll end up seeing after a\nperiod of time once the installer is done,\n\n277\n00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:05.470\nis that it will count down and\nyou'll actually see-\n\n278\n00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.220\n&gt;&gt; Time out on you.\n\n279\n00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, time out or you'll end up getting\nthose words in the bottom like it's not\n\n280\n00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.492\na genuine copy or something like that.\n\n281\n00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:12.660\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n282\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.980\n&gt;&gt; So those are different-\n\n283\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.200\n&gt;&gt; We wanna be genuine, Ronnie.\n\n284\n00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do, that's exactly what you\nwant in a real production environment.\n\n285\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.040\nBut as far as evaluating it, right.\n\n286\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.470\nHere it gives you 180 days,\nthat's six months.\n\n287\n00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.020\nThat's a lot of time for\nyou to do an evaluation.\n\n288\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.550\nBut then of course,\nthey're expecting you to purchase.\n\n289\n00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:33.670\nAnd then of course you can enter in\nthe true activated copy of the key.\n\n290\n00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.170\nDon't think that I'm just gonna go back\nand actually reenter that key again.\n\n291\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.590\nIt's not going to help you to\nmake it a true activated copy.\n\n292\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.730\nSo it's just a little warning, so\n\n293\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.890\neven though you'll see a whole list of\nkeys there on that link that Cherokee's\n\n294\n00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.630\ngoing to share,\nit's worth the time if you're evaluating.\n\n295\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.350\nIt's not worth the time if you're saying,\n\n296\n00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.160\nI'm just going to build my entire\nnetwork based off of these KMS keys.\n\n297\n00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.030\nIt's not going to work.\n\n298\n00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nbecause the audit process is real.\n\n299\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.400\nAs a matter of fact, you get 30 days,\nif you are audited by Microsoft, and\n\n300\n00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.020\nthey do have the ability to do that.\n\n301\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.025\nSo, just be aware of that and\nthat's a real thing.\n\n302\n00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:10.090\n[LAUGH] We're not just making that up and\ntrying to scare you guys, but\n\n303\n00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:11.670\nit is a paid for product.\n\n304\n00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:15.340\nIf we take a look at my screen now,\nwe're almost here, we're at 94% and\n\n305\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.800\nwhat's about to happen,\nis a restart, right?\n\n306\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.190\nWhen this machine restarts, and\nyou'll see this too if you're\n\n307\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:27.050\nbooting from the ISO here, like the type\nof install that I just performed,\n\n308\n00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:32.360\nyou're gonna see a blank screen pop up and\nit'll say press any key to continue.\n\n309\n00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.030\nBut remember, it's trying to boot\nof of that installed media so\n\n310\n00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.220\nwe don't want to press any key to\ncontinue, otherwise you'll be walking\n\n311\n00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.850\nthrough this exact same process again and\nthat would be just a waste of time.\n\n312\n00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.000\nSo were just about to finish up and\nthe we'll need to set the password and\n\n313\n00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.960\ndo some configuration here in the GUI but\nI'll also try get in\n\n314\n00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.720\nsome PowerShell cmdlets to to\nshow you how to configure it.\n\n315\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.270\n&gt;&gt; Right and Cherokee somebody brought up\nsomething great in the chat room said so,\n\n316\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:02.080\nbig deal that if I actually can run\nthis every six months no biggie,\n\n317\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.124\nI'll just reinstall and\nwe can just continue to go on do that.\n\n318\n00:18:05.124 --> 00:18:05.710\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Good luck with that.\n[LAUGH]\n\n319\n00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.010\n&gt;&gt; Well with the evaluation\n\n320\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.850\ncopy though you're gonna find out\nit actually is a link to a time,\n\n321\n00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.850\nthat the time that you downloaded\nthat evaluation copy from.\n\n322\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.770\nSo it's gonna be 180 days from that\npoint that you downloaded that copy.\n\n323\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.800\nSo it's not like you can just go like\nsix months later I'm just gonna install\n\n324\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.930\nthat same one.\n\n325\n00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.990\nIt probably will work but you'll probably\nsee as soon as you enter that KMS key,\n\n326\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.400\nit's just gonna tell you it's not\na genuine copy of that edition.\n\n327\n00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.940\nAnd you're just gonna have to fight\nit every single step of the way.\n\n328\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.650\nAs you continue to try and work with it.\n\n329\n00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.490\nSo you can try it.\n\n330\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.940\nDon't do it, it's not really worth your\neffort if you're trying to do this.\n\n331\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.800\nCuz somebody even mentioned,\nlet's do this on a domain controller.\n\n332\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.740\nNot a good idea.\n\n333\n00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.020\nYou can, but it's probably not gonna\nbe worth your effort and time.\n\n334\n00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.720\nBut it is something to think about.\n\n335\n00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.090\nEverybody does have their\nway to work around it.\n\n336\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.820\nAnd we've got, of course, the smartest\n\n337\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.300\npeople right here watching us-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n338\n00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.970\n&gt;&gt; and they're coming up with every way\n\n339\n00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.190\npossible to try and\nget around that license and copy.\n\n340\n00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.710\n&gt;&gt; And that brings up\na really great point, Ronnie.\n\n341\n00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.900\nBecause hey, a lot of you in IT,\nyou're problem-solvers.\n\n342\n00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.460\nYou're always trying to find\nother ways to do things.\n\n343\n00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.900\nAnd you know what, even inside some.\n\n344\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.840\nI'm putting together some of these shows\nfor you guys here, I found a lot of\n\n345\n00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.270\nways to bypass tried and true Microsoft\ndocumented ways of doing things,\n\n346\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.530\nlike even migrating roles and so forth.\n\n347\n00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.190\nBut I will say this, so, yes,\nyou're not limited to only doing things\n\n348\n00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.650\nthe Microsoft way, but for the exam-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n349\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.330\n&gt;&gt; That's really what they're looking for.\n\n350\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.820\nSo they want you to understand and\nknow their tools, products and steps.\n\n351\n00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.302\nSo, just as a disclaimer here, I'm\ngoing to be going by the Microsoft way-\n\n352\n00:19:40.302 --> 00:19:40.826\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n353\n00:19:40.826 --> 00:19:42.812\n&gt;&gt; But just know there's always other ways\n\n354\n00:19:42.812 --> 00:19:43.490\nto do things.\n\n355\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.000\nFor sure.\n\n356\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.650\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so\nwhere are we on our installation?\n\n357\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:51.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I've got where it says,\npress any key to boot from CD or DVD.\n\n358\n00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.150\nOkay, so now we're actually loading.\n\n359\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.180\nIt'll just take a few minutes to finalize,\nget my user profile,\n\n360\n00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.440\nand everything squared away here.\n\n361\n00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.080\nBut we're getting close.\n\n362\n00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.420\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee,\n\n363\n00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.200\nwhat happens if you press any button\nwhen that little link pops up?\n\n364\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.500\n&gt;&gt; So it will actually revert to like\nloading from that media, that installation\n\n365\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.900\nmedia, and yeah, will just do that\nexact same process all over again.\n\n366\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.160\nSo number one, there is no any key on\nyour keyboard, so don't be looking for\n\n367\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.010\nthat key.\n\n368\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.520\nAnd number two,\ndon't press a single, any key.\n\n369\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.340\nJust don't do it.\n\n370\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.796\n&gt;&gt; Just let it install,\nlet it do its thing.\n\n371\n00:20:23.796 --> 00:20:25.721\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Have a little patience and see,\n\n372\n00:20:25.721 --> 00:20:27.990\nif we look here now at my screen,\nwe're ready to go.\n\n373\n00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.100\nWe just need to select a password.\n\n374\n00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.500\nI'm just gonna select the good old\nMicrosoft install demo password here.\n\n375\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.550\nThen we'll hit enter.\n\n376\n00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.910\nAnd it'll go ahead and\nstart finalizing some of our settings.\n\n377\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:42.860\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n378\n00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.210\n&gt;&gt; There are a few things\nthat we would want to,\n\n379\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.080\nman you know I think I did this again.\n\n380\n00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.670\nFor your virtualization environment,\nI did full screen here.\n\n381\n00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.860\nSo let me just.\n\n382\n00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.000\n&gt;&gt; All right so Cherokee the issue\nthat you're having here is probably\n\n383\n00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.620\nreally exclusively with using\nthe hyper V right now right.\n\n384\n00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:07.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so because I had put full screen\nso we can see it in that full screen view.\n\n385\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.570\nIf I were to hit Ctrl+Alt+Del I would\njust be initiating that command for\n\n386\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.530\nmy local machine.\n\n387\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.320\nIf you look at this and hover over\nthis little button this is going\n\n388\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.380\nto be issuing your control alt delete for\nthat virtual instance.\n\n389\n00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.970\nSo that is what we will go ahead and\nselect here.\n\n390\n00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:27.410\nNow I'm going to go ahead and log on as\nthe administrator for my local machine.\n\n391\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.580\nThat's really the only\noption I have at this point,\n\n392\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.550\nthat password that we've just created so\nwe'll go ahead and enter that.\n\n393\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.664\nHowever we will set this up\nto be joining a domain and\n\n394\n00:21:37.664 --> 00:21:41.326\nthen we'll also be able to utilize\nour domain credentials as well.\n\n395\n00:21:45.246 --> 00:21:48.736\n&gt;&gt; Now what it's doing right now is\nit's just setting up the default or\n\n396\n00:21:48.736 --> 00:21:51.050\nthe first profile that comes on.\n\n397\n00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's just asking us here hey,\n\n398\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.810\ndo you wanna enable\nnetwork discovery here?\n\n399\n00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.140\nSo, that's gonna be at your discretion,\nI'm gonna select Yes and\n\n400\n00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.840\nthen it's just gonna be\nloading up Server Manager.\n\n401\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.900\nAnd the first initial time is going\nto take a little bit longer here,\n\n402\n00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.940\nbut we should be good\nto go here in a moment.\n\n403\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.500\nThere are a few things that\nwe'll want to configure.\n\n404\n00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:17.815\nSo number one, we think about\nServers in a network environment.\n\n405\n00:22:17.815 --> 00:22:20.155\nSo when we utilize DHCP,\n\n406\n00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:24.225\nworking with clients,\nthere are some DHCP with clients is fine.\n\n407\n00:22:24.225 --> 00:22:27.325\nBut some devices within your network,\nyour hardware devices,\n\n408\n00:22:27.325 --> 00:22:31.255\nlike your networking equipment,\nprinters, servers,\n\n409\n00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:34.540\nthose types of things we want\nto set with a static IP address.\n\n410\n00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.080\nSo that amongst a few others are going\nto be what we want to jump in there and\n\n411\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.420\nconfigure first.\n\n412\n00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.990\nSo let me just, on the left hand side here\nfor your local server if you go ahead and\n\n413\n00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.240\nselect that.\n\n414\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.380\nThat's really what we're\ngoing to be looking at.\n\n415\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.090\nFirst to configure.\n\n416\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:54.010\nNow, this machine by default\nyou'll notice Microsoft has quite\n\n417\n00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.790\nthe interesting naming scheme here.\n\n418\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.920\nThis is, and it's a little blurry there,\nbut it's like WIN and\n\n419\n00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.880\nthen a bunch of numbers.\n\n420\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.970\nSo we wanna change that\ncomputer name as well.\n\n421\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.480\nYou'd wanna choose a logical name\nto kind of explain what that\n\n422\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.870\nfunction of that server is.\n\n423\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.620\nAnd then here by default\nwe're at a work group and\n\n424\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.420\nwe'll want to change that to be\na part of the domain as well.\n\n425\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.310\nA couple of other things we'll\nwant to change would be.\n\n426\n00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.610\nI'll kind of scroll over here and\nour server manager let me zoom out so\n\n427\n00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.640\nyou can get a better view.\n\n428\n00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:29.450\nWill be the timezone information as well.\n\n429\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:34.563\nSo it might not seem like a big deal\nat first, but it is because certain\n\n430\n00:23:34.563 --> 00:23:40.561\nauthentication and security utilities\nare gonna be based upon your time zone and\n\n431\n00:23:40.561 --> 00:23:45.323\nthey're gonna time out to prevent\ntypes of replay attacks and so\n\n432\n00:23:45.323 --> 00:23:51.175\nforth if that time isn't synced up, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and change that.\n\n433\n00:23:51.175 --> 00:23:54.164\nSo I am currently in\nthe Eastern time zone.\n\n434\n00:23:54.164 --> 00:23:57.978\nI'm in Florida, so I wanna note that.\n\n435\n00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:02.908\nAnd they have a drop down menu here,\nand I'm just going to go ahead and\n\n436\n00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:08.060\nselect my eastern time zone,\nhit ok, and I should be good to go.\n\n437\n00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.617\nNow, I do have a couple other options.\n\n438\n00:24:10.617 --> 00:24:15.177\nIf I wanted to specify additional clocks\nthat I wanted to sync up to, if I were\n\n439\n00:24:15.177 --> 00:24:20.195\ngoing to use government or anything like\nthat, but the default for me is just fine.\n\n440\n00:24:20.195 --> 00:24:21.855\nSo we'll just keep that and we'll hit OK.\n\n441\n00:24:24.889 --> 00:24:26.735\nAnd where did my server manager go here?\n\n442\n00:24:29.115 --> 00:24:29.905\nLet me pull that back up.\n\n443\n00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.770\nAnd that's the little icon down here.\n\n444\n00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.308\nIt's like a toolbox.\n\n445\n00:24:34.308 --> 00:24:35.180\nAll right?\n\n446\n00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.190\nNow, we'll also go into talking\nabout server manager in depth.\n\n447\n00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.890\nBut for right now,\n\n448\n00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:46.630\nwe'll just work with the most initial\nconfigurations that you want to set.\n\n449\n00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.475\nSo changing that IP address,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n450\n00:24:48.475 --> 00:24:50.500\ndo that,\nbecause that's pretty important as well.\n\n451\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.885\nWe can do this through a command line\ninterface which I'll show you in\n\n452\n00:24:54.885 --> 00:24:55.800\na later show.\n\n453\n00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.974\nBut right now, I only have one\nadaptor on this particular machine, so\n\n454\n00:24:59.974 --> 00:25:04.220\nI'll just right click here,\nselect properties, and then go ahead and\n\n455\n00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.080\nspecify my TCP/IP version four settings.\n\n456\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:07.580\nHit properties.\n\n457\n00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.467\nAnd so I wanna go ahead and make sure I'm\nchoosing an IP address that fits within,\n\n458\n00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:19.360\nand we talked about planning for\nyour server installation,\n\n459\n00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.942\nyou'll also wanna make sure you're\nhearing to that specified network\n\n460\n00:25:23.942 --> 00:25:26.800\nscheme that's designed for your network.\n\n461\n00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.310\nSo here I'm just gonna go ahead and\nselect, put my num locks on.\n\n462\n00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:37.838\nThis will be, we'll name it 10 to\nassign the IP address to 10.1.0.100.\n\n463\n00:25:37.838 --> 00:25:41.320\nWe'll give it a class C subnet mask here.\n\n464\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.790\nAnd we'll leave the default gateway\nblank for now, but remember,\n\n465\n00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.240\nif you wanted to in a production\nenvironment, traverse your network,\n\n466\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.870\ngo out to the internet, which most of\nthe time that's what we're looking for\n\n467\n00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.440\nhere, you would want to go ahead and\ndo that.\n\n468\n00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.854\nNow, if I can get to the right place here,\nI'm so zoomed in.\n\n469\n00:26:00.854 --> 00:26:01.811\nBut for my DNS,\n\n470\n00:26:01.811 --> 00:26:06.306\nI already have a particular domain\ncontroller set up running DNS, so you\n\n471\n00:26:06.306 --> 00:26:11.410\nnormally would want to have at least two\nDNS servers in your network environment.\n\n472\n00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.100\nI'm just gonna specify one for now,\nand this is going to be 10.1.0.10.\n\n473\n00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:20.080\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit OK.\n\n474\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.840\nAnd let me zoom out.\n\n475\n00:26:26.125 --> 00:26:27.930\nHit Close.\n\n476\n00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.260\nAnd again, close out of here.\n\n477\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.906\nThis little button up here on\nthe top right corner will refresh.\n\n478\n00:26:35.906 --> 00:26:38.770\nSo this IP address should\nnow reflect that change.\n\n479\n00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:43.680\nAnd you can see that it has here.\n\n480\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.479\nSo you see our 10.1.0.100.\n\n481\n00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.856\nAll right, so\nnow the next thing I'd like to do.\n\n482\n00:26:48.856 --> 00:26:52.060\nWe've changed the time,\nwe've assigned a static IP address.\n\n483\n00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.350\nLet's go ahead and change our computer\nname and join this to the domain.\n\n484\n00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.290\nSo, in a production environment,\nyou may wanna go ahead and\n\n485\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:04.370\nchoose a computer description and I'm just\ngoing to go ahead and leave that blank for\n\n486\n00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:09.850\nnow, but for the computer name,\nit's going to be this option right here.\n\n487\n00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:14.770\nAnd it says Change, so\nwe'll go ahead and select that, and\n\n488\n00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.900\nhere I can change that default name to\nsomething a little more appropriate.\n\n489\n00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:25.230\nSo I'm just gonna type in DemoSvr01,\nso demo server.\n\n490\n00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.590\nAnd I will also go ahead and\njoin it to a domain there.\n\n491\n00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.320\nCouple different ways to do this that\nwe'll take a look at, so It's important\n\n492\n00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.750\nfor you to know, hey, what if I'm running\nServer Core and I don't have this option?\n\n493\n00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:41.790\nBut the particular domain I wanna join in,\nhopefully I can get this dummy name right.\n\n494\n00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:47.360\nI think it's itprodemo.com,\nand we'll hit Okay.\n\n495\n00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:55.310\nAnd as long as that domain controller\nis up, functional, running.\n\n496\n00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.710\nYou've configured\nthe appropriate IP settings.\n\n497\n00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.660\nYou're on the same network.\n\n498\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.430\nYou have the correct subnet mask.\n\n499\n00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.380\nThen that means you're able to\ncommunicate with that domain controller.\n\n500\n00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.820\nAnd now I'm being\nprompted to authenticate,\n\n501\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.720\nto allow this machine to go ahead and\njoin that domain.\n\n502\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.070\nSo I'm going to type in administrator.\n\n503\n00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.020\nAnd we'll put in our password that we\ncreated, if I can remember it, and\n\n504\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:17.930\nhit enter.\n\n505\n00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:23.160\nNow what's happening, every time you\nchange the name of the computer and join\n\n506\n00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.440\nit to a domain or change it back to a work\ngroup, you'll need to restart the machine.\n\n507\n00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.630\nSo here it says,\nwelcome to the itprodemo.com domain.\n\n508\n00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:33.280\nWe'll hit OK.\n\n509\n00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.920\nAnd then we'll also be prompted\nto go ahead and restart.\n\n510\n00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.710\nAnd that's something\nthat we will need to do.\n\n511\n00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.840\nSo we'll hit OK and just give it\na second to go ahead and do that.\n\n512\n00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.580\nNow, there are a couple other\nthings that I wanted to show you.\n\n513\n00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.844\nI know we're getting short on time, but-\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna have to close out of that\n\n514\n00:28:50.844 --> 00:28:52.040\nto restart.\n\n515\n00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:52.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThat's right.\n\n516\n00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.500\nI'm just sitting here talking to you.\n\n517\n00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.630\nAnd it's kind of strange\nthat it always does that.\n\n518\n00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.570\nIt pops behind the window that's up.\n\n519\n00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.040\nSo, don't be alarmed.\n\n520\n00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.890\nBut, we'll hit restart now.\n\n521\n00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.590\nBut, there are a couple of other things.\n\n522\n00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.106\nI'm looking at the sheet here,\n\n523\n00:29:05.106 --> 00:29:08.259\nI dont know if we have enough time\nto do a little bit of an uninstall.\n\n524\n00:29:08.259 --> 00:29:12.420\nSo we might have to come back for a little\nshort part two Ronnie, what do think?\n\n525\n00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.550\nDo we have enough time?\n\n526\n00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.190\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, let's go ahead and do this\ninstead, we're going to take whatever we\n\n527\n00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.720\nhave little bit remaining, add it on to\nthe other episode where we're gonna do\n\n528\n00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.160\nanother installation without the GUI,\nand finish this one up as well.\n\n529\n00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.080\nAnd that will give us a nice\nfull episode there as well,.\n\n530\n00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.840\n&gt;&gt; Sounds brilliant and challenging.\n\n531\n00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.940\nSo I'm up for that challenge, all right.\n\n532\n00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.440\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n533\n00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.560\nwell thank you again for helping us out\nwith this part in the GUI installation.\n\n534\n00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.380\nAnd now we're gonna be moving into\nthe server core installation as well.\n\n535\n00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.610\nBut that is for another episode then.\n\n536\n00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.950\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n537\n00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.050\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n538\n00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:54.298\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more MCSA\nWindows Server 2012 for Exam 70-410 show.\n\n539\n00:29:54.298 --> 00:29:55.098\n&gt;&gt; That's a mouthful.\n\n540\n00:29:55.098 --> 00:30:01.404\n[MUSIC]\n\n541\n00:30:01.404 --> 00:30:03.914\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching It Pro TV.\n\n",

Cherokee picks up from the previous episode by removing the GUI events to Server 2012 R2 leaving us with Server Core.  She demonstrates the quickness of the installation process when choosing the Server Core type and shows some of the configuration utilities that will help an admin do initial configuration on Server 2012 R2.",

00:00:08.258\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:12.384\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:15.283\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:22.130\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 12, for exam 70-410.\n\n7\n00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.990\nI'm your show host Ronnie Wong and\nwe are taking a look at installing\n\n8\n00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.460\nWindows Server but\nthis time Server Core edition instead.\n\n9\n00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.220\nAnd here, to help us out is gonna\nbe Cherokee Boose Cherokee,\n\n10\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.230\nwelcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.270\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.290\nHow are you?\n\n13\n00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine.\n\n14\n00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.310\nNow, Cherokee, we in a previous episode\nwe had actually done the install\n\n15\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.220\nwith the graphical user interface and\nthere were a few things that you said,\n\n16\n00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.110\nhey let's go ahead and do this but\nwe didn't have enough time.\n\n17\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.990\nSo you wanted to pick that from\nwhere we're going to do today.\n\n18\n00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.360\nAnd then, talk about this idea of\ndoing a Server Core installation.\n\n19\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.590\nCherokee, let's just pick back up and\nsee what happens there.\n\n20\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay yeah,\nwe definitely installed that with a GUI.\n\n21\n00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.420\nBut, I did wanna show you how you can,\nlike I said.\n\n22\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.896\nFlop between those different styles,\nthe core versus the full blown GUI.\n\n23\n00:01:12.896 --> 00:01:16.692\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:19.687\nuse PowerShell to perform\nthis function here and\n\n25\n00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:23.940\nthe first thing I want to note is\ngoing to be get dash Windows feature.\n\n26\n00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.200\nWe can use a wild card,\nwild card, excuse me,\n\n27\n00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.190\nif we type in GUI here and hit Enter,\nit's looking for components\n\n28\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.870\nwith the term GUI in that\nparticular cmdlets syntax.\n\n29\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.880\nSo if we see those two components,\nthe cmdlets listed here,\n\n30\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.220\nthis is really gonna be referencing the\nserver GUI management info, this top one.\n\n31\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.910\nThis is going to be what the parameter or\nthe cmdlet that you can select\n\n32\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.610\nif you wanted to kind of go in\nthat in between phase here.\n\n33\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.313\nBut if I wanted to install or\n\n34\n00:02:01.313 --> 00:02:05.384\nuninstall all of that then I would\nalso use the server GUI shell and\n\n35\n00:02:05.384 --> 00:02:10.213\nthat's like stripping it all the way\ndown and that's what we want to do here.\n\n36\n00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:11.579\nOn the left-hand side,\n\n37\n00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.548\nthis x indicates that these two\ncomponents are currently installed, so\n\n38\n00:02:15.548 --> 00:02:20.065\nwe wanna remove them, and there's\na couple different ways we can do that.\n\n39\n00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:23.775\nI can take this information\nthat I just typed in here and\n\n40\n00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:28.025\nthen I can also pipe\nthat out to an uninstall.\n\n41\n00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:31.896\nSo I would just do pipe, space, uninstall.\n\n42\n00:02:31.896 --> 00:02:39.255\n-windowsFeature.\n\n43\n00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:44.120\nAnd then you will need to go ahead and\ndo a restart there different\n\n44\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.890\nways you can restart a machine,\nthat's one option you have.\n\n45\n00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.896\nBut I'm just gonna go ahead and\nclear all this out and\n\n46\n00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:56.334\nshow you another way that you could do\nthat as well if I didn't want to type that\n\n47\n00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:58.408\nout I could just type in uninstall.\n\n48\n00:02:58.408 --> 00:03:01.500\nAnd that's going to be Windows feature\n\n49\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.200\nIf I can spell [LAUGH] this\ncorrectly l and specify the name.\n\n50\n00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.429\nThe name here is going to\nbe both of those cmdlets.\n\n51\n00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:13.702\nNow, I want to make sure\nI'm using both of them so\n\n52\n00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:18.398\nI'll specify here my Server-Gui,\n-management,\n\n53\n00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:22.352\nM-G -M- T,- infro, I- N- F- R- O\n&gt;&gt; That's a T.\n\n54\n00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:24.870\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thank you, Ronnie,\n\n55\n00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.640\nbecause it does need to be\nspelled correctly here.\n\n56\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.160\nI'll also add the second cmdlet here.\n\n57\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.141\nThis is going to be a server-GUI,\nand this is my full shell,\n\n58\n00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:39.180\nso we're going to be removing that.\n\n59\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.430\nYou can add the restart parameter but\nif you forget and you hit Enter it will\n\n60\n00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.022\nnotify you and prompt you and say hey you\nneed to go ahead and perform a restart.\n\n61\n00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:52.280\nSo that's one way we can remove\nthat graphical interface.\n\n62\n00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.990\nBut we really need to also take\na look at how to set up and\n\n63\n00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.550\ninstall Server Core from the onset and\nwe'll do that in a second here as well.\n\n64\n00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.070\nWe can give it a minute and\ngo ahead and start that other one and\n\n65\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.790\ncome back to this to save time so\nthat's what we'll do, just minimize that.\n\n66\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.875\nNow, I've set up a virtual machine here\nand let's just do our enhanced view.\n\n67\n00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:19.526\nI have in, once the operating system is\ninstalled I can go ahead and do that,\n\n68\n00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:21.890\nbut, let me power this machine on.\n\n69\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.970\nThe initial steps here when we're walking\nthrough our installation wizard will be\n\n70\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.020\nthe same as what we saw with\nour graphical installation,\n\n71\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.840\nso that part isn't any different.\n\n72\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.430\nAgain, we'll go ahead, and walk through\nour language page, and hit install now.\n\n73\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.548\nAnd really isn't until once you finish\nthat and you've restarted the computer\n\n74\n00:04:43.548 --> 00:04:47.070\nthat you notice, hey,\nthings are are little different here.\n\n75\n00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.560\nSo, again this is just\ngonna be our default but\n\n76\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.800\nthis time we'll leave at that\ncore installation and hit Next.\n\n77\n00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:59.220\nAgain, agree to our here custom keep\n\n78\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.805\nthe default drive info\njust give it a second.\n\n79\n00:05:03.805 --> 00:05:07.190\nAnd again, it will go through that\nprocess of walking through all the files.\n\n80\n00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.340\nSo you know just to save a little bit of\ntime we'll go ahead and do a TV timeout so\n\n81\n00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.750\nyou don't have to wait for us here and\nthen we'll pick right back up.\n\n82\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.520\nAlright, so it looks like our\ninstallation, has completed here.\n\n83\n00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.950\nIf we take a look at my screen,\nthere are still a few housekeeping things,\n\n84\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.170\nthat we need to do.\n\n85\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.820\nFor instance, we'll go ahead and\nchange our admin password, we'll hit OK.\n\n86\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.490\nBut we're still kind of in\na graphical interface here, so\n\n87\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.720\nthat's kind of interesting, right?\n\n88\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.740\nBut, not for long.\n\n89\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.514\nAlright, so once we go ahead, and\nchange that password, it's just,\n\n90\n00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.740\ngonna pull that up, we still okay.\n\n91\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.189\nWait for it, wait for it.\n\n92\n00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.922\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n93\n00:05:48.922 --> 00:05:54.461\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, and we're expecting this\nbig extravagant thing to happen,\n\n94\n00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.235\nand-\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n95\n00:05:56.235 --> 00:05:56.921\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n96\n00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:58.440\n[LAUGH] So\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n97\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.070\n&gt;&gt; So that's gonna be your core install.\n\n98\n00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.260\nYou have your command prompt\nthat'll pop up by default.\n\n99\n00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.450\nSo just a couple things real quick in\ncase your, and let me change this view.\n\n100\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.003\nI can't get to that enhanced session yet.\n\n101\n00:06:13.003 --> 00:06:17.693\nBut let me just do a couple things here\nreal quick so that you can see, just in\n\n102\n00:06:17.693 --> 00:06:22.775\ncase like, hey, I've never been inside\nof just a straight Server Core before.\n\n103\n00:06:22.775 --> 00:06:26.438\nAnd if I bring this font up\nit might help as well, so\n\n104\n00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:29.770\nyou guys can actually\nsee what we're doing.\n\n105\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.650\nAnd let's see, the colors will change,\nthe screen text to white instead of gray.\n\n106\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.048\nThat may help a little bit.\n\n107\n00:06:38.048 --> 00:06:39.223\n&gt;&gt; You need to change that font.\n\n108\n00:06:39.223 --> 00:06:46.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's change it to the Lucinda,\nor, there we go.\n\n109\n00:06:48.414 --> 00:06:50.086\n[LAUGH] It's just so small.\n\n110\n00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:52.495\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna have to change the size.\n\n111\n00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:54.167\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My goodness, bear with me,\n\n112\n00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:58.291\nsorry about this, guys, let's get that,\nbump it up to, let's say, 20?\n\n113\n00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:01.550\nI think our eyes should be good with that,\nthere we go.\n\n114\n00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.720\nSo this is just a regular Command Prompt.\n\n115\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:14.024\nYou can launch, let's see,\ntaskngr.exe from here if you wanted to.\n\n116\n00:07:15.105 --> 00:07:17.635\nThere are,\nalthough this is the core version,\n\n117\n00:07:17.635 --> 00:07:21.945\nthere are some graphical components that\nstill do exist, just be aware of that,\n\n118\n00:07:21.945 --> 00:07:25.455\nwhich is nice, because,\na couple different things.\n\n119\n00:07:25.455 --> 00:07:29.925\nI could go ahead and launch a new task,\n\n120\n00:07:29.925 --> 00:07:33.420\nrun a new task from here,\nI could type in PowerShell.\n\n121\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.667\nBut, I don't have to, but\nI do have the option here to go ahead and\n\n122\n00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:42.469\nlaunch PowerShell and let's just go\nahead and fix it while we are in here.\n\n123\n00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:44.639\nLet's change the font on this, too.\n\n124\n00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:51.119\nLet's bump it up to 20 and,\nalso make that white.\n\n125\n00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:56.184\nSo I could use PowerShell here,\nbut alternatively when\n\n126\n00:07:56.184 --> 00:08:01.789\nyou're in the Command Prompt you\ncould type in PowerShell And\n\n127\n00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:07.810\nit looks the same but\nyou're actually in the PowerShell mode.\n\n128\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.680\nThough, I just wanted to show you\nthat you have two different options.\n\n129\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.770\nAnd the fact that you can launch\n\n130\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.730\nyour Task Manager to pull up and\nstart a service if you wanted to.\n\n131\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.460\nIf you accidentally close out of one of\nthese windows, you don't have to shut or\n\n132\n00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.930\nrestart the computer or\nlog off to bring one of those back.\n\n133\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.298\nYou could just hit Ctrl+Alt+Delete\nto go ahead and pull that up.\n\n134\n00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:31.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Cherokee,\nif we go ahead and\n\n135\n00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.630\nbegin with the Server Core installation,\ndo we have the option like you showed\n\n136\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.970\nus just a few minutes ago,\nwhere we can install the GUI back?\n\n137\n00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.220\nDo we have that option?\n\n138\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.140\n&gt;&gt; So that's a really great question,\nRonnie, because it can give you some\n\n139\n00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:52.615\ntrouble if you do not know where your SxS\nfiles, your source files are located.\n\n140\n00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.625\nBecause you will need those\navailable in order to\n\n141\n00:08:55.625 --> 00:08:59.887\npull those particular features\nback into your operating system.\n\n142\n00:08:59.887 --> 00:09:03.987\nSo if you don't have a network\nshare like a central repository,\n\n143\n00:09:03.987 --> 00:09:07.057\na UNC path where those files are stored,\n\n144\n00:09:07.057 --> 00:09:10.827\nthen you would need to have access\nto that physical installation disk.\n\n145\n00:09:10.827 --> 00:09:13.170\nOtherwise that's gonna\ngive you some problems.\n\n146\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.140\nIt doesn't exist.\n\n147\n00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.500\nSo you have it pull it\ndown in from somewhere.\n\n148\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.350\nAnd that goes to say also for when you,\nwe'll talk more about roles and\n\n149\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.260\nfeatures but if you completely remove\na role from the operating system,\n\n150\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.130\nyou'll always need to pull that\nfrom the source file there.\n\n151\n00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.090\nSo, great question.\n\n152\n00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.050\nLet's check on our other machine\nhere because this is, remember,\n\n153\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.310\nlet me just bump back.\n\n154\n00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.460\nThis is our GUI machine\nthat we had worked with.\n\n155\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.050\nAnd I told you that there would be\na restart warning so we do see that here.\n\n156\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.450\nAnd I can just go ahead and\neither do a restart or\n\n157\n00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.900\na shutdown -r, to go ahead and\nhave that happen.\n\n158\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.270\nAnd it's just notifying me.\n\n159\n00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.160\nBut remember, this is that machine that\nwe were removing those components on.\n\n160\n00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.480\nAnd I'll just minimize that for now so we\ncan take a look back here in our core and\n\n161\n00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.310\nthink about, hey,\nnow that we have this particular instance,\n\n162\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.510\nthis core installation,\nhow do we configure it?\n\n163\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.050\nBecause remember we used\nServer Manager to go ahead and\n\n164\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.430\nconfigure everything last time, we don't\nhave that crutch here, so to speak.\n\n165\n00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:18.500\nSo, let's see if I can pull up\n\n166\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.940\nmy enhanced session, not yet, so\nI guess we'll just kinda play with it.\n\n167\n00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.870\nA couple different ways, I could use\nthe blue PowerShell, I could use this\n\n168\n00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.550\nblack PowerShell, it really doesn't\nmatter, so I'll stick with this for now.\n\n169\n00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:34.900\nIf you think about some other things that\nwe did, some of the administrative things\n\n170\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.110\ninitially were changing that\nto timezone information.\n\n171\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.970\nWe also wanted to set a static IP address.\n\n172\n00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.700\nSo let's start there.\n\n173\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.710\nAnd there are different\ntools available to us.\n\n174\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.757\nSo we have options with the command line\ninterface installation like this, so.\n\n175\n00:10:50.757 --> 00:10:55.940\nWe have tools such as netdom.exe and\nthat's what I'll be showing you here so\n\n176\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.600\nwe can actually change our adapter\nsettings and our IP address.\n\n177\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.085\nWe also have an older method,\nit's called netsh.\n\n178\n00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:09.787\nIt's a command that you can use to perform\na lot of configuration and functions.\n\n179\n00:11:09.787 --> 00:11:14.860\nBut just so you know, netsh has all but\nbeen replaced by PowerShell.\n\n180\n00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.360\nPowerShell is there to kind of\npush netsh out of the way but\n\n181\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.670\nit is still working at this point in time.\n\n182\n00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.380\nAnd then we'll also look at a menu-driven\noption, which is called sconfig\n\n183\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.690\nto configure, which is a little bit\neasier than what we're gonna start with.\n\n184\n00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.510\nBut I wanted you to know that\nthere are options out there.\n\n185\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.160\nSo let's start with netdom.\n\n186\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.870\nAnd one of the things that\nwe wanna do is change the IP\n\n187\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.210\naddress of that particular machine.\n\n188\n00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.560\nSo I might not know how many adapters\nare on this particular machine.\n\n189\n00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:51.110\nSo what we can do is first,\ntype in Get-NetAdapter.\n\n190\n00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:56.019\nAnd this is going to display the different\nphysical NICs that are installed on\n\n191\n00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:57.010\nthat machine.\n\n192\n00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.210\nAnd just give it a second here.\n\n193\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.400\nAnd then it'll display that information\n\n194\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.980\nthat is pertinent to the next\ncommandlet that I will run.\n\n195\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.570\nSo it's checking the system,\nthen it says, hey,\n\n196\n00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.108\nlook, I found an Ethernet adapter here.\n\n197\n00:12:11.108 --> 00:12:16.330\nNow, my ifIndex here is going to be 12 and\nthat's really what I was looking for\n\n198\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.200\nbecause I'm using that numerical\nnumbering, that name, to go ahead and\n\n199\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.800\ninput it into my next command.\n\n200\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:31.750\nSo what I want to type\nis New-NetIPAddress,\n\n201\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.120\nand here we're just creating\nour static IP address here.\n\n202\n00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.260\nI do need to specify that interface.\n\n203\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.040\nSo we'll say interface index.\n\n204\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.560\nAnd this is where we'll put that 12.\n\n205\n00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.170\nAnd then I need to choose an IP address.\n\n206\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:53.450\nSo if I just stick with\nmy naming convention.\n\n207\n00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.960\nOops, sorry, hold on.\n\n208\n00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.170\nHad a typo there.\n\n209\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:03.870\nOkay, so 10.1.0, and we'll just say,\n.23 and let's say I chose that IP address.\n\n210\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.516\nAnd then I'll need to specify my prefix\nlength which is just going to be my\n\n211\n00:13:08.516 --> 00:13:09.744\nsubnet mask here.\n\n212\n00:13:09.744 --> 00:13:15.162\nSo my prefix length is\ngoing to be slash 24,\n\n213\n00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:19.303\nso I'm just going to type in 24.\n\n214\n00:13:19.303 --> 00:13:23.458\nAnd if you recall, we didn't set\na default gateway for this demo, but\n\n215\n00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:26.768\nyou do have the option to set\na default gateway here, and\n\n216\n00:13:26.768 --> 00:13:30.370\nthen that would just be\nfollowed with the numerical IP.\n\n217\n00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.810\nWe'll hit Enter and give it a second.\n\n218\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.880\nAnd now it'll automatically show our\ninformation here, our network information.\n\n219\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.380\nWe can see that our IP address\nis now set at 10.1.0.23.\n\n220\n00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.130\nSo that's pretty cool,\n\n221\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.560\nI didn't need to utilize the graphical\ninterface to go ahead and set that.\n\n222\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.380\nThat's not the only option, I just\nwanted to show you that particular tool.\n\n223\n00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.750\nBut let's go ahead and think about what\nelse we might want to do on this machine.\n\n224\n00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.620\nLet me just clear this real quick so\nwe get a fresh start.\n\n225\n00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.750\nBut one of the initial configurations,\nlike we joined that\n\n226\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.650\nother machine to a domain, we can also\ndo that here with a different tool.\n\n227\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.422\nIt's called your netdom tool.\n\n228\n00:14:11.422 --> 00:14:14.750\nSo netdom is one way to\ngo about doing this.\n\n229\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.430\nIt's a little bit of typing involved but\nthat's okay,\n\n230\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.090\nyou guys get the luxury\nof watching me type here.\n\n231\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.330\nSo if we go ahead and do an ipconfig/all,\n\n232\n00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.860\nwhat I'm doing is just getting\nthe current Windows assigned name, so\n\n233\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.230\nthat I can copy and paste this here,\nmake it a little bit easy.\n\n234\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:38.100\nSo, it's actually, we'll hit mark, and\nthen highlight it, and then go back here\n\n235\n00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.170\nto our edit, and then copy, and\njust hold on to that information.\n\n236\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.580\nWe're gonna plug it into\nour netdom command here.\n\n237\n00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.700\nSo we've got netdom and\nthen it's renamed computer.\n\n238\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.450\nAnd here I'm going to go ahead and\npaste that.\n\n239\n00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.525\nSo just go up here, edit, paste.\n\n240\n00:14:57.525 --> 00:15:01.650\nAnd the name of that machine,\nthe new name,\n\n241\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:06.632\nwe want to specify that, so we go ahead\nand put forward /NewName, and we can say,\n\n242\n00:15:06.632 --> 00:15:13.040\nsvr01core to let us remember\nthat this is that core instance.\n\n243\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.080\nAnd I think that's it.\n\n244\n00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.380\nWe'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n245\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.360\nAnd it gives us a notification saying,\nhey,\n\n246\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.310\nyou're going to be changing\nthe name of this computer.\n\n247\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:26.760\nIt could disrupt services if it relies\non that association with that name,\n\n248\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.400\nso especially domain controllers.\n\n249\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.300\nYou don't want to be changing their\nnames once you go ahead and set that up.\n\n250\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.810\nDo you want to proceed?\n\n251\n00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.360\nWe'll hit yes and Enter.\n\n252\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.589\nNow, it says that we need to go ahead and\nrestart.\n\n253\n00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:42.631\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee, we can use\nthat netdom command but it seems like\n\n254\n00:15:42.631 --> 00:15:47.448\na fairly kind of complex type of commands\nthat you have to be able to use.\n\n255\n00:15:47.448 --> 00:15:49.705\nBut you did mention that there was\nsomething easier that we could use.\n\n256\n00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:52.595\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so, Ronnie,\nlet's take a look at my screen and\n\n257\n00:15:52.595 --> 00:15:54.732\nI'll introduce the Sconfig utility.\n\n258\n00:15:54.732 --> 00:16:00.413\nSo if I simply type Sconfig,\nC-O-N F-I-G, hit Enter.\n\n259\n00:16:00.413 --> 00:16:03.624\nWe're now looking at\na menu-driven interface.\n\n260\n00:16:03.624 --> 00:16:06.630\nI have a couple of numerical options for\nus.\n\n261\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.565\nAnd we've already changed\nthe name of this machine,\n\n262\n00:16:10.565 --> 00:16:14.210\nwhich is reflected here as SVR 01 core.\n\n263\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.389\nBut we haven't yet joined it to a domain.\n\n264\n00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:21.282\nThere are some important networking\nconfigurations that we need to specify in\n\n265\n00:16:21.282 --> 00:16:26.114\norder for this machine to be able to\ncommunicate with our domain controller.\n\n266\n00:16:26.114 --> 00:16:29.425\nAnd that's going to be relying on DNS.\n\n267\n00:16:29.425 --> 00:16:34.373\nSo we do need to specify our DNS server\nhere, so just looking at this menu\n\n268\n00:16:34.373 --> 00:16:38.590\nyou might look at this and\nsay hey, where's our DNS option?\n\n269\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.430\nWell, it's hidden a little bit and it's\ngoing to be under your network settings.\n\n270\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.520\nBecause we've already changed the IP\naddress, you could go in here to 8 and\n\n271\n00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.850\nchange that as well.\n\n272\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.586\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ntype in 8 and\n\n273\n00:16:50.586 --> 00:16:53.482\nthen use my little scroll\nbar to scroll down.\n\n274\n00:16:53.482 --> 00:16:56.174\nAnd here you can see that adapter and\n\n275\n00:16:56.174 --> 00:17:01.360\nthe index number here is going to be 10 so\nwe'll just type in 10.\n\n276\n00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:08.896\nYou hit Enter and now you can go ahead and\nspecify the DNS server here.\n\n277\n00:17:08.896 --> 00:17:11.250\nSo currently, let's see what we've got.\n\n278\n00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.710\nWe've got our IP address that we've set,\n\n279\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:18.800\nwe have our subnet mask, and\npreferred DNS is not set.\n\n280\n00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.614\nSo let's see, set network after address.\n\n281\n00:17:20.614 --> 00:17:26.456\nNumber 2 is set DNS server, so what we\ndo is type 2 in here and hit Enter.\n\n282\n00:17:26.456 --> 00:17:31.564\nNow I kinda have to remember the IP\naddress of my DNS server here.\n\n283\n00:17:31.564 --> 00:17:35.118\nI wanna say,\nenter new prefered DNS server.\n\n284\n00:17:35.118 --> 00:17:41.892\nSo yes, and I wanna say it was 10.1.0.10,\ncould be wrong.\n\n285\n00:17:41.892 --> 00:17:46.827\nBut here you do see some of those\nremnants of the graphical user interface.\n\n286\n00:17:46.827 --> 00:17:49.080\nWe'll hit OK.\n\n287\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:55.060\nAnd if I had an alternate DNS server,\nI would go ahead and provide that as well.\n\n288\n00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:59.784\nIf I wanted to go back to the main menu, I\nwould go ahead and select 4 and hit Enter.\n\n289\n00:17:59.784 --> 00:18:03.100\nThe DNS server could not be set.\n\n290\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.752\nLet me just check my notes real quick,\nI think-\n\n291\n00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:06.750\n&gt;&gt; It went back to the menu.\n\n292\n00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.978\nIt just said you need to do none\nif you didn't have an alternate.\n\n293\n00:18:08.978 --> 00:18:10.198\n&gt;&gt; For the alternate there, that's fine.\n\n294\n00:18:10.198 --> 00:18:13.112\nI only have one set up in\nthis environment anyways.\n\n295\n00:18:13.112 --> 00:18:16.398\nSo let's go back to 4 to my main menu.\n\n296\n00:18:16.398 --> 00:18:17.536\nDid I select that?\n\n297\n00:18:17.536 --> 00:18:20.410\nNow there are a lot of other things\nthat we could configure here.\n\n298\n00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.710\nWe could,\nlike we had joined the domain before,\n\n299\n00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.030\nyou could do that right\nwithin this interface.\n\n300\n00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.786\nIt is important to know what you can and\ncannot do within this interface.\n\n301\n00:18:28.786 --> 00:18:32.641\nSo if I were you, I would take some\ntime getting acclimated with this tool.\n\n302\n00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:35.637\nYou may see this type\nof information again.\n\n303\n00:18:35.637 --> 00:18:38.843\nYou could go ahead and log off,\nI'm trying to think what else is cool.\n\n304\n00:18:38.843 --> 00:18:41.982\nLike we had set the times in and\neverything before,\n\n305\n00:18:41.982 --> 00:18:43.811\nthis is kind of interesting.\n\n306\n00:18:43.811 --> 00:18:47.838\nIf you do hit number 9 here and\nhit Enter to set that time zone,\n\n307\n00:18:47.838 --> 00:18:53.192\nyou have again little remnants of that GUI\nand I think even some of these concepts.\n\n308\n00:18:53.192 --> 00:18:57.713\nThey're not fully functional\nbecause you don't have\n\n309\n00:18:57.713 --> 00:19:00.569\nthe ability to go ahead and set it.\n\n310\n00:19:00.569 --> 00:19:03.414\nBut here you can use\nthe graphical components.\n\n311\n00:19:03.414 --> 00:19:11.508\nBut let's see here, just hit Cancel and,\nWe have our computer name.\n\n312\n00:19:11.508 --> 00:19:14.283\nI'm trying to think if there's\nanything else really important here.\n\n313\n00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:17.905\nI would just go ahead and\nplay again with your network setting.\n\n314\n00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:21.918\nThat's probably going to be the most\nimportant component, because you wanna set\n\n315\n00:19:21.918 --> 00:19:25.828\nyour IP address, your subnet mask,\nyour default gateway, your DNS servers.\n\n316\n00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:30.451\nAnd then you're able to do everything that\nwe were able to do within the GUI there to\n\n317\n00:19:30.451 --> 00:19:32.997\ngo ahead and\nget this server up and running and\n\n318\n00:19:32.997 --> 00:19:37.960\nget it prepared to run whatever role it is\nthat you have planned for this machine.\n\n319\n00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.410\nAnd I think that's about it for\nthis show, Ronnie.\n\n320\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.500\nWe've covered quite a bit.\n\n321\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.030\nSo I think we're good there.\n\n322\n00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:43.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n323\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.190\nWell, thank you again for\nhelping us get started in installing,\n\n324\n00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:52.036\nof course,\nthe Server 2012 R2 Server Core edition.\n\n325\n00:19:52.036 --> 00:19:55.822\nRemember that this is gonna be the default\ninstall that when you first put in your\n\n326\n00:19:55.822 --> 00:19:58.887\nsource files that's the one it's\ngonna naturally default to.\n\n327\n00:19:58.887 --> 00:20:01.987\nSo if you're a habitual somebody\nlike I am, you just click, click,\n\n328\n00:20:01.987 --> 00:20:03.276\nclick through everything.\n\n329\n00:20:03.276 --> 00:20:03.996\nYou get click happy.\n\n330\n00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:06.340\nYou're gonna end up\ninstalling the Server Core.\n\n331\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.386\nIt shouldn't frighten you.\n\n332\n00:20:08.386 --> 00:20:12.362\nYou should be able now to have the at\nleast, some of the tools that you can use\n\n333\n00:20:12.362 --> 00:20:16.640\nto do some basic configuration and\nkeep it that way, if you choose to.\n\n334\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.250\nBut also, Cherokee helped us out by\nreminding us that, if we wanted to,\n\n335\n00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:25.515\nwe could also switch back and\nadd in that GUI as well.\n\n336\n00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:28.548\nBut if you're gonna do that, you also\nneed access to the source files as well.\n\n337\n00:20:28.548 --> 00:20:32.499\nSo just like what we saw in the server\nGUI edition and where we could or server\n\n338\n00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:36.781\nGUI interface, where we could actually do\nthat, we can also do it the other way.\n\n339\n00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:38.859\nSo we can flip backward and\nforward with that.\n\n340\n00:20:38.859 --> 00:20:40.241\nAll right, Cherokee, any last words?\n\n341\n00:20:40.241 --> 00:20:44.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so Ronnie, in addition to\nthe options that we did see in this show,\n\n342\n00:20:44.036 --> 00:20:47.589\nI just wanna remind you guys that\neven if you are running Server Core,\n\n343\n00:20:47.589 --> 00:20:50.118\nyou're not completely\nabandoned with the GUI.\n\n344\n00:20:50.118 --> 00:20:53.824\nBecause you do have the option for\nremote administration so\n\n345\n00:20:53.824 --> 00:20:58.492\nyou could from another machine be using\nServer Manager as well as your MMC or\n\n346\n00:20:58.492 --> 00:21:00.732\nSnap-ins from another computer.\n\n347\n00:21:00.732 --> 00:21:05.260\nSo you'll have those graphical tools even\nif you choose to install Server Core for\n\n348\n00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.107\nthe actual production machine.\n\n349\n00:21:07.107 --> 00:21:08.848\nJust keep that in mind as well.\n\n350\n00:21:08.848 --> 00:21:11.475\n&gt;&gt; And believe or not,\nthat's gonna be a great way for\n\n351\n00:21:11.475 --> 00:21:15.387\nyou to learn more about Server is doing\nthat because inside of Microsoft as of\n\n352\n00:21:15.387 --> 00:21:17.649\nthe recording of this particular episode,\n\n353\n00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:21.900\nyou're gonna see a big push towards\nthat remote server administration.\n\n354\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.933\nSo get used to actually seeing it as well.\n\n355\n00:21:23.933 --> 00:21:26.557\nAll right, well, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n356\n00:21:26.557 --> 00:21:30.412\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n357\n00:21:30.412 --> 00:21:31.328\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n358\n00:21:31.328 --> 00:21:36.518\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n359\n00:21:36.518 --> 00:21:42.463\n[MUSIC]\n\n360\n00:21:42.463 --> 00:21:45.424\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:08.277\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:12.209\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.090\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.185\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 12 R2, for exam\n\n7\n00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:24.950\n70-410, now that's a mouthful, but that is\npractically what we are covering today.\n\n8\n00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.740\nNow we're diving into roles and features,\n\n9\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.550\nand here to help us out today is\ngoing to be Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.710\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie,\nhow are you today?\n\n12\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.140\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well now, Cherokee,\nas we get started, just go ahead and\n\n13\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.150\nremind us a little bit of what we had just\nrecently covered in our previous episode.\n\n14\n00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.330\nAnd then, let's talk about the roles and\nfeatures as we get to it.\n\n15\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.700\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so Ronnie, in the last show we\nreally wrapped up talking about Sconfig or\n\n16\n00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.170\nserver configuration,\nthat menu driven utility.\n\n17\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.860\nAnd we were really looking at the benefits\nas to why one would want to use a core\n\n18\n00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.480\ninstallation versus a graphical user\ninterface install, and we talked about,\n\n19\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.560\nthe reduced footprint, security issues,\nmaximizing our hardware.\n\n20\n00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.050\nBut, remember that\nbecause we are forfeiting\n\n21\n00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.550\nsome of those features to\nobtain some of those benefits.\n\n22\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.330\nSo when we're talking about our roles and\nfeatures,\n\n23\n00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.210\nwe do see a limited amount when we're\ntalking about that core installation.\n\n24\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.450\nAnd this show is really gonna be featuring\nfocused on those roles and features and\n\n25\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.830\nhow we can use them and manage them.\n\n26\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.356\nIf we can take a look at my screen, I'd\nlike to show you some of the differences\n\n27\n00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:37.494\nhere and\nyou can screenshot these if you want.\n\n28\n00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:40.434\nBut just knowing and\nbeing aware the fact that,\n\n29\n00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:45.359\nhey, when I'm talking about the roles\nthat are available in Server Core versus\n\n30\n00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.889\nthe roles that are unavailable,\njust be aware of those so\n\n31\n00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:53.671\nthat as you're planning and continuing\nto plan throughout your environment\n\n32\n00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.450\nyou don’t get kind of blindsided\nby any of these ideas here.\n\n33\n00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.930\nSo, that's just something\nto consider there,\n\n34\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.685\nbut one of the really cool\nthings about Microsoft, and\n\n35\n00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:10.385\nthey have this concept,\nthis notion called features on demand.\n\n36\n00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:16.235\nAnd it goes with that same ideology\nlike utilizing the core installed.\n\n37\n00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:20.270\nThey're saying hey, and you think back\nlike principle of least privilege, right?\n\n38\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.430\nOr I'm only gonna be using what's\nnecessary to perform my job function.\n\n39\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.700\nSo why should I have all this extra\ncode and all this extra script here, and\n\n40\n00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.730\nthis interface if I'm not using it?\n\n41\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.160\nSo with features on demand we really\nhave the ability to selectively pick and\n\n42\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.300\nchoose what we want installed\non that operating system.\n\n43\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.370\nAnd that information is gonna be\nstored in something that we call SxS,\n\n44\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.430\nside by side, folder there, so\nthat's the actual location.\n\n45\n00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.685\nAnd I always get tricked\nup when I try to say that.\n\n46\n00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:54.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's going to be under your root,\n\n47\n00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.580\nand we can take a look at\nthat here on my screen too.\n\n48\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.400\nLet's just go ahead and get out of here,\nand pull up my demo, so this is going to\n\n49\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.590\nbe by default the location is going to\nbe under your c drive and under windows.\n\n50\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.640\nAnd scrolling all the way down at\nthe bottom we can find this folder.\n\n51\n00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.050\nAnd let me just zoom in so\nyou can see that,\n\n52\n00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.560\nhere we have the WinSxS folder and\nif right-click, and\n\n53\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.760\nselect the properties you'll note that and\nit's just kind of propagating here, but\n\n54\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.335\nit's gonna be approximately five\ngigs give or take a little bit here.\n\n55\n00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:35.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My goodness gracious!\n\n56\n00:03:35.355 --> 00:03:38.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not normal.\n\n57\n00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:39.564\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n58\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.690\nOkay, let's see what happens.\n\n59\n00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.470\nSo that's actually really interesting.\n\n60\n00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.260\nIt's normally about 5 gigs, maybe 6.\n\n61\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.750\n&gt;&gt; Something apparently updated,\nI'm assuming.\n\n62\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is interesting.\n\n63\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.946\nSo let me just make sure I\nselected the right folder here.\n\n64\n00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:01.704\nYeah, okay.\n\n65\n00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:06.619\nBut anyways, maybe it's something\nwith the way that this lab,\n\n66\n00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.906\nokay, that's a little more normal here.\n\n67\n00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:11.252\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So 6.2 gigs, okay?\n\n68\n00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:12.311\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n69\n00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:15.440\n&gt;&gt; But that number isn't\neven completely accurate.\n\n70\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.860\nIt's a little inflated because of the way\nthat the operating system is actually\n\n71\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.400\nutilizing these installation files, so if\nyou wanted to get the best as is picture,\n\n72\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.780\nthen you would need to go ahead and\nrun a particular command tercel.\n\n73\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.480\nLet me just back on out of here and\npull up a power shell real quick and\n\n74\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.480\nI want to show you where you can\nget the most detailed information\n\n75\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.150\nabout that particular file store here.\n\n76\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:47.390\nLet me just change my font size so,\nwe can see this real quick, all right.\n\n77\n00:04:48.674 --> 00:04:54.140\nSo the command were actually gonna\nbe using here is going to be DISM,\n\n78\n00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.340\nwhich is a DISM tool\n\n79\n00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.130\nwe will also take a look at this tool\nmore in depth a little bit later on.\n\n80\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.780\nIt can be used in many ways.\n\n81\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:09.546\nSo DISM / online / clean up- image,\n\n82\n00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:16.840\nand then space forward / analyze.\n\n83\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.370\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\ntype in our component store.\n\n84\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.940\nThat is if I spelled everything correctly.\n\n85\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.930\nAnd this will give us a bit of information\nthat we're really looking for here.\n\n86\n00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.810\nNow this may take a minute to go ahead and\nfill in and\n\n87\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.340\npropagate as well as you saw it working\nand calculating everything in the GUI,\n\n88\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.465\nso let's just give it a second here,\n\n89\n00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:46.122\nwe're about 71% And remember\n\n90\n00:05:46.122 --> 00:05:51.280\nthis is the default location where I\njust showed you under that C drive.\n\n91\n00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.697\nBecause of the size of that\nfile it may be optimal for\n\n92\n00:05:55.697 --> 00:06:00.735\nlarger organizations to save\non storage space by creating\n\n93\n00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:06.934\na centralized location and\nsharing that path out to multiple servers.\n\n94\n00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:10.347\nSo we don't have duplicate\ndata on our network and\n\n95\n00:06:10.347 --> 00:06:14.896\njust wasting that storage space there,\nand we'll take a look at,\n\n96\n00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:18.732\nif I were to change that\ndefault location in PowerShel.\n\n97\n00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:22.410\nAnd then sometimes you'll need\nto specify that source for\n\n98\n00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.060\nthat particular file store there.\n\n99\n00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.650\nSo, this is just gonna take a few more\nseconds, here, but, let's go ahead and\n\n100\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.292\ndo a magical TV time out, and just give\nit a second to go ahead and finish.\n\n101\n00:06:34.292 --> 00:06:40.170\nAll right, it looks like our analysis\nhere is complete, our command has ran.\n\n102\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.288\nSo where this would be beneficial would be\nwhen you are trying to compare before and\n\n103\n00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:50.037\nafters for removing some of those\nfeatures talking about really slimming or\n\n104\n00:06:50.037 --> 00:06:51.911\nstreamlining your systems.\n\n105\n00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:55.533\nNow, we're not talking a ton\nof storage space here,\n\n106\n00:06:55.533 --> 00:06:59.077\nvery miniscule on an independent\nserver level, but\n\n107\n00:06:59.077 --> 00:07:04.480\nif we're talking exponentially, and\nwe have several hundred servers.\n\n108\n00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.920\nThat storage may add up so, that is\nsomething you would at least want to\n\n109\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.350\nbe aware of, so there's actually three\ndifferent states that our roles and\n\n110\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.270\nfeatures may be in and we'll take\na look at those in a few minutes.\n\n111\n00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.330\nYou'll see it in the operating system, but\n\n112\n00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.830\nI just wanna explain to\nyou the three states.\n\n113\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.570\nSo enabled means that it's enabled,\nit's installed,\n\n114\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.410\nit's running, it's working,\nit's It's good to go.\n\n115\n00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.020\nYou've went to the process and\nyou've enabled it.\n\n116\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.360\nAnd you'll see that listed in\nthe actual in PowerShell as available.\n\n117\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.488\nAnd the second state is going\nto be disabled or excuse me,\n\n118\n00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:43.467\nlet me just rephrase that.\n\n119\n00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:46.602\nWhen it's enabled it will say\ninstalled next to it, and\n\n120\n00:07:46.602 --> 00:07:49.814\nyou'll see that as we continue\nto work with PowerShell.\n\n121\n00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:52.845\nSo enabled,\nit will be listed as installed.\n\n122\n00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:56.126\nIf it's disabled It will say available.\n\n123\n00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:59.106\nSo it means hey, it's available for\nyou to go ahead and enable it.\n\n124\n00:07:59.106 --> 00:08:02.940\nIt's just kind of sitting here available,\nready, waiting to go.\n\n125\n00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.930\nAnd then the third option that we\ndo have is going to be disabled,\n\n126\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.150\nwith the actual components\nremoved from that local drive.\n\n127\n00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.810\nSo from that s,\nthat side by side component store there.\n\n128\n00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.870\nSo that's gonna look like,\n\n129\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.090\nit'll actually just say removed whenever\nyou're working with PowerShell.\n\n130\n00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.760\nSo just be aware of that,\nwe'll see that in a few minutes.\n\n131\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.640\nBut what I really want\nto do is take a look\n\n132\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.680\nat using our roles within the GUI, so\nlet me go ahead and close out of here.\n\n133\n00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.790\nAnd it's very easy,\nthe way that they've designed\n\n134\n00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.600\nServer Manager to make this very\nuser-friendly, very intuitive.\n\n135\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.740\nI mean, it's pretty blatant here.\n\n136\n00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.370\nIt says Add Roles and Features.\n\n137\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.630\nAnd so just by clicking right here,\nI can go ahead and\n\n138\n00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.230\nlaunch the Add Roles and Features wizard.\n\n139\n00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.110\nThis is just the introduction screen.\n\n140\n00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.090\nSo we'll go ahead and select Next here.\n\n141\n00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.770\nAnd we won't really talk\ntoo much about this yet.\n\n142\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.690\nWe haven't talked about virtual\ndesktop infrastructure.\n\n143\n00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.840\nWe're gonna stick here with our role-based\nor feature-based installations, and\n\n144\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.500\nwe'll hit hit Next.\n\n145\n00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.520\nNow, when I'm running through this wizard,\n\n146\n00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.130\nI have the ability to go ahead and\ninstall this role on the local machine.\n\n147\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.470\nThat's what I have selected here.\n\n148\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.010\nBut from Server Manager, all right,\n\n149\n00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.472\nlet me just minimize this real quick,\nif I click on local server, right?\n\n150\n00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:37.980\nThat's PLABDMO1, that's the machine\nwe're working here locally.\n\n151\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:43.290\nBut if I wanted to go ahead and here in\nthis section, it says, add all servers.\n\n152\n00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.860\nI could go ahead and add an additional\nserver into a server pool, and\n\n153\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.030\nwe'll spend a little more time\nwithin Server Manager, but\n\n154\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.720\nit's very simple just to go ahead and\nadd that server.\n\n155\n00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.410\nAnd so\nwhen I'm running through this wizard,\n\n156\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.780\nit will automatically display\nwithin this section right here.\n\n157\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.910\nSo I'd have the ability to go ahead and\nselect\n\n158\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:10.180\nan additional or multiple, and\ninstall those roles in tandem.\n\n159\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.440\nAnd that's really cool for\nremote administration.\n\n160\n00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.760\nAnother great feature that I\nhave here that I can use within\n\n161\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.420\nthe graphical user interface,\nas well as another tool,\n\n162\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:29.200\nI can also use DISM to go ahead and\nadd roles to offline images here.\n\n163\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.269\nSo I have the ability to also select\na virtual hard disk, which may be nice.\n\n164\n00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:40.000\nIn 70-411, you'll look at more deployment\nservices, or Windows deployment services.\n\n165\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.410\nAnd if you have those images ready to go,\nto go ahead and push out throughout your\n\n166\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.608\nenterprise, this is a really nice feature\nthat they do have available as well.\n\n167\n00:10:48.608 --> 00:10:54.960\nAll right, so you would just specify\nthe location for that hard disk and\n\n168\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.750\nyou would also need to mount it just so\nthat it would have access to those files.\n\n169\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.490\nBut for right now,\n\n170\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.630\nwe're just gonna install it on our\nlocal machine and we'll hit Next.\n\n171\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.290\nThis is another very great thing\nabout the graphical user interface.\n\n172\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.245\nHere, you have a list of all your roles,\nand if you're not familiar with what\n\n173\n00:11:14.245 --> 00:11:19.235\neach role has to offer,\nyou can select that individual role and\n\n174\n00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:23.855\nsee how this first one, Active Directory\nCertificate Services, is highlighted.\n\n175\n00:11:23.855 --> 00:11:28.855\nAnd in the right-hand pane, Microsoft\nprovides a high-level description of what\n\n176\n00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:32.285\nthat role or feature actually does for us.\n\n177\n00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:34.555\nNow I did say role or feature.\n\n178\n00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:39.800\nWe'll be taking a look at features\nhere in a moment, but whenever you see\n\n179\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.850\nthis little box here, so File and Storage\nServices is going to actually be installed\n\n180\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.930\nby default, and that is selected.\n\n181\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.922\nThat means that that role,\nwhen that box is filled in,\n\n182\n00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:56.472\nit means that that role\nis already installed.\n\n183\n00:11:56.472 --> 00:12:01.991\nNow, talking about that SxS store,\nthere are a couple of components, features\n\n184\n00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:07.691\nthat are not going to be integrated, and\nthose are gonna be your .NET frameworks.\n\n185\n00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:11.040\nAnd we've mentioned them\nin previous shows, and\n\n186\n00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.666\nsometimes roles have dependencies,\nsupporting, or sub-roles or\n\n187\n00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:19.890\nfeatures, that are required for\nthem to work correctly.\n\n188\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:25.880\nSo you may encounter that where you need\nto have either the installation disk,\n\n189\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.720\nor a source file, or\nInternet connectivity to go ahead and\n\n190\n00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.960\npull down those missing components there.\n\n191\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.370\nBut for this particular one,\nlet me just go ahead and hit Cancel.\n\n192\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.380\nI want to actually install, let's go\nahead and install an app server here,\n\n193\n00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.910\nso let's select Application Server and\nhit Next.\n\n194\n00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.100\nAnd here you can see your description.\n\n195\n00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.580\nApplication Server provides\ncentral management and hosting for\n\n196\n00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.220\nhigh performance distributed\nbusiness applications,\n\n197\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:58.770\nsuch as those built with enterprise\nservices and .NET Framework 4.5.\n\n198\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.530\nSo, I wanted to show you this,\n\n199\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.350\nbecause you'll see how that\nframework sometimes is required.\n\n200\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.770\nAnd you can see that it is selected here,\nso mine are already installed.\n\n201\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.020\nBut you would have to go ahead and\n\n202\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.271\nmake sure you had all those\nsupporting components.\n\n203\n00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.760\nIn the graphical user interface,\n\n204\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.660\nthe system really delineates\nbetween roles and features.\n\n205\n00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.680\nIt's not so obvious when we look in\nPowerShell, but they do list the roles at\n\n206\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.430\nthe top, and when we get into PowerShell\nyou'll see what I mean there.\n\n207\n00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.136\nBut just scrolling through and\n\n208\n00:13:30.136 --> 00:13:34.792\nreally getting acclimated is probably your\nbest bet getting some hands on in here and\n\n209\n00:13:34.792 --> 00:13:39.463\nlooking at each one you're not familiar,\nas to what that particular feature does.\n\n210\n00:13:39.463 --> 00:13:44.570\nBut we're just gonna hit Next for\nnow, and then Next.\n\n211\n00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:49.440\nThis screen here will give some nice\npertinent information, if there’s any kind\n\n212\n00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.420\nof notes that you may want to note,\njust says, hey, things to note.\n\n213\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.940\nWe recommend that you install Web Server\nIIS support if you plan on using hosted\n\n214\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:02.870\ndistributed applications using the ASP.net\nor Windows Communication Foundation.\n\n215\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.530\nSo it gives you a little bit\nof guidance there as well.\n\n216\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.480\nAll right, so it's still showing select\nthe role services to install for\n\n217\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.740\nthe application server.\n\n218\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.840\nIf you had any kind of additional, like,\nsay, okay, yeah, I do want to go ahead and\n\n219\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:24.630\ninstall IIS support or any other kind\nof specific supporting features there.\n\n220\n00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.791\nThat's where you would select them.\n\n221\n00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:30.796\nAll right, now,\nthis portion right here, for\n\n222\n00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:35.080\nthe restart the destination\nserver automatically if required.\n\n223\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.620\nI'm not a big fan of selecting that,\njust because I like to have a little bit\n\n224\n00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.470\nmore control as to when\nthe system is going to restart.\n\n225\n00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.500\nSometimes you'll wanna make sure you can\nonly do that during an optimal time,\n\n226\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.140\nlike a maintenance window.\n\n227\n00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.120\nSo I just don't get in\nthe habit of clicking that, but\n\n228\n00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.450\nyou certainly can if you choose to do so.\n\n229\n00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.350\nAnother great option we have here,\nlet me zoom in so\n\n230\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.150\nyou can see this,\nis to export these configuration settings.\n\n231\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:05.480\nSo If you wanna have this configuration,\neither for\n\n232\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:11.600\nbackup, or you want to just go ahead and\ndeploy similar or duplicate configurations\n\n233\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.300\nin the future, it's just an easy way to\ngo ahead and create that XML file there.\n\n234\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.770\nNow you also have the ability to\nspecify an alternate source path.\n\n235\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.650\nAnd remember, like I had mentioned,\nyou may need to go ahead and\n\n236\n00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:30.660\ndo that if you do not have that SXS,\nthose particular installation files,\n\n237\n00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.290\nif they'd been removed from\nthat particular server.\n\n238\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.467\nAnd then you decide, hey,\nI wanna bring them back in.\n\n239\n00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:39.998\nBecause once they do remove them, they do\ntake it off that local drive, all right.\n\n240\n00:15:42.117 --> 00:15:43.170\nSo we'll hit Install.\n\n241\n00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.537\nJust takes a couple seconds here.\n\n242\n00:15:46.537 --> 00:15:49.497\nThis is also a nice page\nwhen you're finished,\n\n243\n00:15:49.497 --> 00:15:54.455\nor the summarization page to just go ahead\nand screenshot that, if you wanted to\n\n244\n00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:59.047\ninclude it in any kind of configuration\ndocumentation's not a bad idea.\n\n245\n00:16:01.718 --> 00:16:02.748\nAll right.\n\n246\n00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.416\nAnd you'll note and\n\n247\n00:16:06.416 --> 00:16:10.932\nyou'll get familiar with which roles\ndo have supporting components.\n\n248\n00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:11.867\nLike for instance,\n\n249\n00:16:11.867 --> 00:16:15.283\nif I wanted to go ahead and install\nthe Active Directory Domain Services.\n\n250\n00:16:15.283 --> 00:16:19.130\nI'm going to need DNS,\nbecause they work hand in hand there.\n\n251\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.369\nSo just kind of get\nfamiliar with that as well.\n\n252\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.928\nAll right, and\nif we look at my screen here again,\n\n253\n00:16:28.928 --> 00:16:31.440\nyou can close out of this window.\n\n254\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.266\nIt's not going to prohibit or\nstop the installation process,\n\n255\n00:16:36.266 --> 00:16:38.003\nif you close out of it.\n\n256\n00:16:38.003 --> 00:16:41.978\nBut I just wanted to go ahead and\nkeep this up for us.\n\n257\n00:16:41.978 --> 00:16:45.100\nYou could hit Close,\nyou could wait for your notifications.\n\n258\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.415\nAnd sometimes like this flag right here,\nafter you install a roller feature.\n\n259\n00:16:50.415 --> 00:16:54.464\nThere may be some post installation\nconfiguration that you need to take care\n\n260\n00:16:54.464 --> 00:16:57.322\nof, and that's where you\nwould be noted right here.\n\n261\n00:16:57.322 --> 00:17:00.516\nSo here it says installation succeeded,\n\n262\n00:17:00.516 --> 00:17:05.850\njust kind of nice to have those\nup front and center for you.\n\n263\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.130\nAll right, now let's take a look\nat how we would handle this from\n\n264\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.310\na PowerShell command line\ninterface perspective.\n\n265\n00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.449\nSo let's just go ahead and\nlaunch PowerShell,\n\n266\n00:17:15.449 --> 00:17:18.359\nand again let me change\nmy properties here.\n\n267\n00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.220\nI should probably just\nminimize it next time\n\n268\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:33.430\nAll right, so\nfirst thing I wanna show you is if\n\n269\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.293\nwe use the Get-Windowsfeature command,\n\n270\n00:17:37.293 --> 00:17:42.242\noops, if I spelled get right\nthat's my problem here.\n\n271\n00:17:42.242 --> 00:17:48.038\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n272\n00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:53.408\nwe can see that there are actually\na lot of different roles and features.\n\n273\n00:17:53.408 --> 00:18:00.341\nAnd like I said, roles will be listed here\nfirst, and scrolling down there are a ton.\n\n274\n00:18:00.341 --> 00:18:02.400\nIn the graphical user interface,\n\n275\n00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.190\nwe were able to see that little\nsquare that was filled in.\n\n276\n00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:11.314\nAnd alternatively in the command line,\nwe'll see this x filled in\n\n277\n00:18:11.314 --> 00:18:16.909\nto indicate if that particular role or\nfeature is currently installed.\n\n278\n00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:21.459\nAnd if we scroll on or just look on over,\nyou can see that it is noted.\n\n279\n00:18:21.459 --> 00:18:25.925\nRemember the different states that I told\nyou about, where you would have available,\n\n280\n00:18:25.925 --> 00:18:27.420\ninstalled, or removed?\n\n281\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.410\nSo that's also gonna give you\na heads up as to what's going on,\n\n282\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.870\nhow is this system configured,\nwhat roles are currently installed?\n\n283\n00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.932\nAnd like I said, you may wanna go ahead\nand remove some of those uninstalled roles\n\n284\n00:18:39.932 --> 00:18:43.598\nto help save some storage space, and\nwe'll look at how we could do that.\n\n285\n00:18:43.598 --> 00:18:49.476\nYou could do it independently and very\ngranular, like going one role at a roll or\n\n286\n00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:55.110\nfeature at a time, or you could just kind\nof do it all in one fell swoop there.\n\n287\n00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.714\nAll right, what else do we have here?\n\n288\n00:18:59.714 --> 00:19:05.955\nI also wanna point out in the GUI,\nwe were able to see that pop out and\n\n289\n00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:10.542\nsay, hey,\nthese features have dependencies.\n\n290\n00:19:10.542 --> 00:19:12.973\nOr these roles have dependencies,\nand you should go ahead and\n\n291\n00:19:12.973 --> 00:19:14.260\ninstall these features.\n\n292\n00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.786\nWe really don't get that assistance here,\nbut\n\n293\n00:19:17.786 --> 00:19:23.703\nyou can see by the indentations that\nthese are gonna be supporting components.\n\n294\n00:19:23.703 --> 00:19:28.918\nSo for instance this windows\nprotection activation service support.\n\n295\n00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:33.911\nSp these are all gonna be additional\nsupporting components of that individual\n\n296\n00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:34.750\nrole there.\n\n297\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.683\nSo that's what that indentation\nis going to indicate.\n\n298\n00:19:38.683 --> 00:19:42.205\nAnd you could use in\nthis middle column here,\n\n299\n00:19:42.205 --> 00:19:45.830\nthis is going to be\nthe actual name to go ahead.\n\n300\n00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.879\nAnd invoke and work within PowerShell for\nthat particular role or feature.\n\n301\n00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:53.150\nSo that's the correct name\nthat you should be typing out.\n\n302\n00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.332\nSo you could use those names to\nwork with them individually.\n\n303\n00:19:56.332 --> 00:20:01.581\nAnd I'll also show you a command that we\ncan use to work with them as a whole here.\n\n304\n00:20:01.581 --> 00:20:06.402\nBut let me just clear my screen,\nbecause it's pretty full right now.\n\n305\n00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:13.619\nThe include dash all sub feature, and\nyou'll see me working with that, that's\n\n306\n00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:19.109\none way where instead of saying, how many\nwere there, four for that particular role?\n\n307\n00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:22.676\nSo instead of typing out\nall four of those names,\n\n308\n00:20:22.676 --> 00:20:26.600\nyou could just do the dash\ninclude all sub parameter.\n\n309\n00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.538\nAnd it's gonna pull all those four in for\n\n310\n00:20:28.538 --> 00:20:32.203\nuse that you don't have to type all\nthose out individually which will help.\n\n311\n00:20:32.203 --> 00:20:35.781\nSo let's go ahead and\ninstall print services,\n\n312\n00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:38.380\nour good old print services here.\n\n313\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:43.127\nSo we'll just say Install-WindowsFeature,\n\n314\n00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.939\nAnd specify the name, and remember this is\nthat name like I showed you in that center\n\n315\n00:20:50.939 --> 00:20:53.208\ncolumn that you would go ahead and use.\n\n316\n00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:58.420\nSo here we're talking\nabout Print-Services.\n\n317\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.330\nAnd this is where I'm going to\nuse that IncludeAllSubFeature.\n\n318\n00:21:11.043 --> 00:21:17.529\nAnd I always want to put an s on this, and\nit just seems like grammatically correct,\n\n319\n00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:20.929\nbut it's IncludeAllSubFeature-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n320\n00:21:20.929 --> 00:21:21.441\n&gt;&gt; FYI.\n\n321\n00:21:21.441 --> 00:21:25.867\nYes, [LAUGH] and\nanother option that you'll have for\n\n322\n00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:32.114\na lot of these features and roles will\nbe to include the management tools.\n\n323\n00:21:32.114 --> 00:21:36.242\nI may not always wanna include\nthe management tools to help reduce space.\n\n324\n00:21:36.242 --> 00:21:40.988\nEspecially if I'm running a DNS on server\ncore, and I don't plan on managing\n\n325\n00:21:40.988 --> 00:21:44.660\nthat server locally and\nI plan on managing it remotely.\n\n326\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.745\nSo I would go ahead and\n\n327\n00:21:45.745 --> 00:21:49.680\ninstall those management tools on the\nserver in which I plane to manage with.\n\n328\n00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:56.715\nSo it could be enabling me to use either\nthe PowerShell modules to manage them or\n\n329\n00:21:56.715 --> 00:22:00.670\nyou could even use\nthe DNS MMC snap in there.\n\n330\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.198\nSo for this particular install,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n331\n00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:04.870\ninstall it on this local machine.\n\n332\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:13.060\nSo I'll say IncludeManagement, Tools.\n\n333\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:18.130\nAnd go ahead and perform a restart,\nyou can add the restart parameter.\n\n334\n00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.526\nBut if I just hit Enter here,\nyou'll see the little otput.\n\n335\n00:22:22.526 --> 00:22:25.004\nIt'll say restart required, and\n\n336\n00:22:25.004 --> 00:22:30.139\nthen it'll alert me as if I need to go\nahead and perform a restart or not.\n\n337\n00:22:30.139 --> 00:22:33.670\nWhich is nice to just get\nfamiliar with looking at that, so\n\n338\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.857\nyou can kind of remember\nwhich ones do require that.\n\n339\n00:22:36.857 --> 00:22:39.916\nIt's just gonna take a second here,\nthat's why I chose this one.\n\n340\n00:22:39.916 --> 00:22:43.070\nIt's pretty quick to install,\nwe won't have to wait too long.\n\n341\n00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.559\nBut it will also tell us the status of\nthat installation, if it had failed or\n\n342\n00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:48.928\nif it was successful.\n\n343\n00:22:48.928 --> 00:22:50.486\nSo we'll just give that a second here.\n\n344\n00:22:52.935 --> 00:22:57.503\nAll right, Okay, so with this,\n\n345\n00:22:57.503 --> 00:23:02.388\nbecause I did not add that restart\ncomponent there, that parameter.\n\n346\n00:23:02.388 --> 00:23:04.780\nIt's saying hey, you must restart\nthis server to go ahead and\n\n347\n00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.155\nfinish the installation.\n\n348\n00:23:06.155 --> 00:23:07.767\nSo we'll just go ahead and do that now.\n\n349\n00:23:07.767 --> 00:23:14.351\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsay shutdown and then -r,\n\n350\n00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.372\nAnd we'll just give it a second here\nto go ahead and perform that restart.\n\n351\n00:23:21.372 --> 00:23:25.794\nAnd then we should be good to go with\nactually installing that particular role\n\n352\n00:23:25.794 --> 00:23:27.230\nfor our print services.\n\n353\n00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.658\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n354\n00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:32.889\nNow as we take a look at this idea, right?\n\n355\n00:23:32.889 --> 00:23:37.021\nBeing able to install these features,\nwhether it's actually using the server\n\n356\n00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:40.490\nmanager or whether we're actually\ndoing it through PowerShell.\n\n357\n00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:45.497\nThese are very important items for\nus to make sure that we get familiar with,\n\n358\n00:23:45.497 --> 00:23:47.934\nespecially as we head into the exam.\n\n359\n00:23:47.934 --> 00:23:49.591\nCherokee, what else do\nwe need to see here?\n\n360\n00:23:49.591 --> 00:23:52.290\n&gt;&gt; So I would like to wait\nuntil this machine comes up.\n\n361\n00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.720\nI don't know if we have enough time,\n\n362\n00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.190\nbecause I think it's always important\nto go back and check your work.\n\n363\n00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:01.790\nSo I wanna check our work, make sure\nwe've installed our print services role.\n\n364\n00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.408\nAnd then I wanna talk about moving\nforward, about removing roles, and ways\n\n365\n00:24:05.408 --> 00:24:08.983\nthat we can do that through PowerShell,\nwe'll still stay in PowerShell.\n\n366\n00:24:08.983 --> 00:24:11.555\nBut I think that's a good\nplace to go ahead and\n\n367\n00:24:11.555 --> 00:24:13.800\ncome back when this machine restarts.\n\n368\n00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.390\nWe'll check our work and\nthen continue within PowerShell.\n\n369\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\nthank you again for helping us out here.\n\n370\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.312\nAt least in getting started, taking\na look at installing the different roles.\n\n371\n00:24:24.312 --> 00:24:27.446\nAnd talking about the features\nthat are available for\n\n372\n00:24:27.446 -->

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.922\nyou're watching the MCSA 70-410 show.\n\n6\n00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:20.780\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong,\n\n7\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.450\nand today we're taking a look at\na part two on features and roles.\n\n8\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.990\nAnd here to help us out to it this\npart two is gonna be Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.650\nCherokee, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.930\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, yeah,\nI didn't get kicked out here so [LAUGH].\n\n11\n00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.750\n&gt;&gt; Well that's actually always\na good plus as we begin,\n\n12\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.590\nespecially since you have\na part two to pick up on here.\n\n13\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.800\n&gt;&gt; I know, we do have some work left.\n\n14\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.390\nWe have to check our work actually and\n\n15\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.130\nmake sure what we did in part\none was actually correct here.\n\n16\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.080\nSo if we take a look at my screen, that\nwould be a great place to go ahead and\n\n17\n00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.610\npick right back up.\n\n18\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.070\nNow looking at Server Manager,\nI have a couple of clues here.\n\n19\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.250\nAgain my notification,\nI had told you guys before remember,\n\n20\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.870\nwe installed print\nservices via PowerShell so\n\n21\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.940\nI also see print services noted,\nwell behind my head there.\n\n22\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.270\nBut it's there, right here,\nthere you go, and it's red, so red hey,\n\n23\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.550\nthere are a few configuration things\nthat you need to go ahead and do.\n\n24\n00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.870\nBut another way you can check your\nwork again is to go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.860\npull up PowerShell, and again let me go\nahead and change this so it's optimal.\n\n26\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.739\nBut you could also check your work by\nchecking the status of that particular\n\n27\n00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:34.880\nservice, so that's something else that\nit's always a good habit to go ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.070\nget in as well.\n\n29\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.664\nSo what we're gonna do here is\ntype in Get-windowsFeature.\n\n30\n00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:48.868\nAnd again this is going to\nbe our print services, so\n\n31\n00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:52.393\nwe'll just type in Print-Services.\n\n32\n00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:56.960\nAnd this is also going to show us that\nstatus, the install state that we had\n\n33\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.980\nspoke about as well, remember\nthe different options that we had there.\n\n34\n00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.770\nAnd here you can see that little\nx we spoke about as well, so\n\n35\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.370\nwe know that it is, from everything\nthat we see here it's good to go,\n\n36\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.201\nso our installation was successful there.\n\n37\n00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:16.516\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee now that we've\nseen that we can install a role using\n\n38\n00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:20.900\nPowerShell on the local machine, you\nhad talked about us saving a little bit\n\n39\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.913\nof effort and\ninstalling the role remotely too, and\n\n40\n00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:27.380\nwe can do that from the same\nPowerShell line, right?\n\n41\n00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.770\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, so\nlet's take a look at my screen and\n\n42\n00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.770\nwe'll go ahead and\nshow you how to do that.\n\n43\n00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.578\nSo we're still gonna be using\nthe install command here,\n\n44\n00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:44.026\nand so this is going to be\nInstall-WindowsFeature.\n\n45\n00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:49.136\nAnd the case, PowerShell for the most\npart here we're not talking about like\n\n46\n00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:55.033\nin certain operating systems it's really\ncase sensitive, so don't worry about that,\n\n47\n00:02:55.033 --> 00:03:00.402\nI normally try to do upper and lower just\nto make it easier to read, but all right.\n\n48\n00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:06.784\nIt's still gonna be Install-WindowsFeature\nand this is gonna be Space dash name, and\n\n49\n00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:12.323\nthen this is still going to be our\nprint services so Space Print-Services.\n\n50\n00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:17.283\nAnd for the actual, once we specify\nthe particular role, here we're\n\n51\n00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:22.325\ngonna go ahead and say dash computer name,\nand we're gonna go ahead and\n\n52\n00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:26.800\nput the name of another domain\nmember inside of my domain here.\n\n53\n00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.817\nSo my computer name is\ngoing to be PLABDM02, and\n\n54\n00:03:30.817 --> 00:03:37.640\nthat's the machine in which I want to\ninstall this print services on remotely.\n\n55\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.730\nSo we'll just go ahead and hit Enter, and\n\n56\n00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.430\njust wait for it to go ahead and\ngo through this process here,\n\n57\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.940\nyou can see it starting that installation,\nit's pretty quick here.\n\n58\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.320\nAnd then we can go ahead and\n\n59\n00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.330\ncheck our work in a moment as soon as\nwe get to go ahead there, all right.\n\n60\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.210\nSo here it says the success was true,\nwas a restart needed, no.\n\n61\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.330\nAnd we do have a warning about automatic\nupdating is not enabled, that's fine, but\n\n62\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.350\nI do wanna go ahead and\n\n63\n00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.550\ncheck on my other machine here to\nmake sure that it is installed.\n\n64\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.560\nAnd I believe this is the correct machine,\njust to verify that this is, yes,\n\n65\n00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.747\nI can see back here PLABDM02.\n\n66\n00:04:19.747 --> 00:04:25.964\nSo what I can do now is just\ntype my Get-WindowsFeature,\n\n67\n00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:33.500\nF-E-A, sorry, I hit my Caps Lock there,\nGet-WindowsFeature.\n\n68\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.561\nAnd here we'll just say name and\n\n69\n00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:44.572\nthen Print-Services and hit Enter.\n\n70\n00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:47.676\nAnd here you can see that\nit has been installed and\n\n71\n00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:52.082\nthat was through our remote\nadministration just using PowerShell.\n\n72\n00:04:52.082 --> 00:04:54.740\nSo that's pretty cool,\nRonnie, don't you think?\n\n73\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.720\n&gt;&gt; It really is, now Cherokee, when we\nactually are able to do this, right,\n\n74\n00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.740\nwe had talked about just briefly that\nthe idea of using the least administrative\n\n75\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.590\neffort is probably the big reason why\nwe want to be able to do this and\n\n76\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.670\nnot only for that for\nthe the future that is to come.\n\n77\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.160\nBut now that we've learned\nhow to install them, right,\n\n78\n00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.220\nthere are times when we actually have to\nkind of prune that a little bit more.\n\n79\n00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.470\nWhich means that we also need to\nuninstall these roles, so Cherokee,\n\n80\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.500\nwhat are we gonna do here?\n\n81\n00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's the perfect word for\nit too I like that, prune it on out.\n\n82\n00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.150\nSo let's go ahead and look at how we can\nuninstall through PowerShell as well.\n\n83\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.652\nSo first of all if you're not\ntoo familiar with the actual\n\n84\n00:05:33.652 --> 00:05:39.105\nnames of the correct syntax what we can\ndo here is, I just wanted to show you,\n\n85\n00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:44.070\nearlier in the show, or\nwas it this show or the last show?\n\n86\n00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.150\nAnyway, at one point in time we installed\nthe application service on this particular\n\n87\n00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.600\nmachine, so maybe I'm like I don't\nremember how that was spelled or whatever.\n\n88\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.179\nSo I can go ahead and\ntype in Get-WindowsFeature,\n\n89\n00:05:56.179 --> 00:06:00.755\nand by using my asterisk or\nwild card here I can just type in *app,\n\n90\n00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:03.852\nI know it was something app,\nand hit Enter.\n\n91\n00:06:03.852 --> 00:06:08.391\nAnd so here I can see my results\nfrom what I've queried here,\n\n92\n00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:13.375\nthat application wild card,\nI can see the particular features and\n\n93\n00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:19.160\nroles with the app name that's included\nand I can see two that are noted here.\n\n94\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.545\nSo this is that application server,\nthis is the one that I was looking for,\n\n95\n00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:23.965\nthe one that we had installed.\n\n96\n00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:28.195\nSo let's say this machine no\nlonger has a need to go ahead and\n\n97\n00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:33.030\nrun as an application server so\nlet's go ahead and uninstall it.\n\n98\n00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.806\nSo the particular cmdlet that I\nwould use will be the uninstall, so\n\n99\n00:06:37.806 --> 00:06:42.853\nun I-N-S-T-A-L-L, and\nthis is going to be -WindowsFeature.\n\n100\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.011\nAnd this is going to be, now that\nI know the name I can go ahead and\n\n101\n00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:53.803\ntype in name and then application.\n\n102\n00:06:56.463 --> 00:07:01.828\nAnd this is -server and\nafter that I am just\n\n103\n00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:07.960\ngoing to use a dash Space\ndash remove parameter.\n\n104\n00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.500\nAll right, so now I am also\nwhen I'm using the dash remove\n\n105\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.290\nparameter I'm actually taking those\ninstallation files out of that\n\n106\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.590\nSXS Folder, so\nwe're completing removing it.\n\n107\n00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.400\nIt's just taking a few minutes here,\nI can check that it was successful,\n\n108\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.740\nI don't need to restart my machine.\n\n109\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.820\nBut this is going to be\nan issue if I really said oops,\n\n110\n00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.220\nI didn't mean to do that,\nlet me go ahead and reinstall it.\n\n111\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.090\nSo if I were to try to reinstall\nit at this point in time\n\n112\n00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.810\nit shouldn't let me here because we\nhave in fact completely removed that.\n\n113\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.847\nSo let's check, so install our feature and\nthis is going to be our name.\n\n114\n00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:04.327\nAnd this is going to be dash\nserver Just give it a second here.\n\n115\n00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:14.141\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee as it looks\nlike it may succeed here Cherokee.\n\n116\n00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:15.606\n&gt;&gt; I know but.\n\n117\n00:08:15.606 --> 00:08:17.710\n&gt;&gt; But\nwe'll see what ends up happening here.\n\n118\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:22.260\nSo the point, though was right,\nis that if you chose to uninstall feature,\n\n119\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.130\nit really does remove\neverything off of that machine.\n\n120\n00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.650\nSo it's not just disabling that feature or\njust saying turn it off.\n\n121\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n122\n00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.050\n&gt;&gt; It actually is removing those files.\n\n123\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.230\nAnd so, Cherokee,\nwe ended up getting an error there.\n\n124\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.730\nWhat happened?\n\n125\n00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so\nthis is what we wanted to see happen here.\n\n126\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.400\nAnd you can see this red is saying was\nthis, oops, I didn't mean to move that\n\n127\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.480\nover, but you can see that this is\nindicated by a false right here, right?\n\n128\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.610\nIf I did in fact want to\nsuccessfully install this,\n\n129\n00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:58.180\nI would just need to go ahead and\nspecify the source.\n\n130\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:02.270\nIt's a -source parameter and\nthen you would put that path whether.\n\n131\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.840\nSo maybe like if you had a UNC\npath you would do the -source and\n\n132\n00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.790\nthen write that path out.\n\n133\n00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:13.175\nSo that the system could go ahead and pull\nthose files in to actually install it.\n\n134\n00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:17.045\nAlternatively, if you wanted to use the\ngraphical user interface, you could do so.\n\n135\n00:09:17.045 --> 00:09:20.975\nAnd I showed you guys when we were\nwalking through that wizard originally,\n\n136\n00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:23.005\nthere was a little section there.\n\n137\n00:09:23.005 --> 00:09:27.620\nA little link at the bottom where it said,\nspecify an alternate source path.\n\n138\n00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.330\nThat's where you would click.\n\n139\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.900\nIf you had removed that feature,\nyou click there and\n\n140\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.650\nthen specify that source path\nto pull those files back in.\n\n141\n00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:42.260\nSo that's an example of, really\nthe benefit of utilizing features on\n\n142\n00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.810\ndemand is to have the ability to pick and\nchoose the different roles and\n\n143\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.180\nfeatures that we have installed\nin our computer here.\n\n144\n00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.640\nAll right, so what's up next here?\n\n145\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.930\nLet's see.\n\n146\n00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:57.999\nIf we go ahead and decide,\nlook, I really wanna slim or\n\n147\n00:09:57.999 --> 00:10:02.090\nprune, as Ronnie said, this system down.\n\n148\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.640\nThere's another command that we can\nuse to go ahead and do it all at once.\n\n149\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.799\nSo let me just clear my screen here and\nmake it a little larger for us.\n\n150\n00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:14.081\nLittle, little bit.\n\n151\n00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:18.410\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthis one's a little bit longer as well.\n\n152\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.910\nI did have it typed it\nout somewhere in Notepad.\n\n153\n00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.440\nThis is the one I warned you guys about.\n\n154\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.984\nSo with my lab environment, though,\n\n155\n00:10:28.984 --> 00:10:31.779\nI do need to go ahead and\npost this into my clipboard.\n\n156\n00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:35.750\nAnd that's all i am doing right now and\nsending it to my remote computer.\n\n157\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.200\nSo that whenever come in here,\nI can go ahead and\n\n158\n00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.718\nshould be able to get that cmdlet.\n\n159\n00:10:41.718 --> 00:10:44.283\nSo lets see, sometimes you get lucky and\n\n160\n00:10:44.283 --> 00:10:50.210\nyou just click once in this virtualization\nenvironment and it'll paste it right in.\n\n161\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.820\nOther times, not so much.\n\n162\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.950\nLet me try it one more time here.\n\n163\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.310\nOtherwise, you guys are gonna see me\njust go ahead and type it all out, and\n\n164\n00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.299\nI think that's probably\nwhat I should do anyways.\n\n165\n00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.290\nAll right, and then edit, and\nI don't have the option to paste.\n\n166\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.374\nThat's okay, we're gonna type this,\nso just be careful here.\n\n167\n00:11:10.374 --> 00:11:12.278\nYou've been warned.\n\n168\n00:11:12.278 --> 00:11:16.535\nAll right, for this particular command,\n\n169\n00:11:16.535 --> 00:11:20.826\nthis is going to be get-windows feature.\n\n170\n00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:24.772\n&gt;&gt; Why don't we move that\nwindow down just a little bit?\n\n171\n00:11:24.772 --> 00:11:27.094\n&gt;&gt; So that they can see all that, okay,\nthat's a good idea, Ronnie, let's see.\n\n172\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.940\nYeah, this is a long one here, I'll\nmove it over too, it's as far as I got.\n\n173\n00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.580\nAll right, so\nthis is gonna be Windows Feature.\n\n174\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.010\nNow we're gonna be piping\nsome of this information out.\n\n175\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:45.415\nSo we're gonna use our pipe command and\nwe're gonna say where the object, so\n\n176\n00:11:45.415 --> 00:11:51.062\nwhere-object Is going to be,\n\n177\n00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:57.026\nand then we have a curly bracket and\nthen we'll use R$_.\n\n178\n00:11:57.026 --> 00:12:01.497\nAnd so we're basically saying where\nthe install state is going to be\n\n179\n00:12:01.497 --> 00:12:03.400\nequivalent to installed.\n\n180\n00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.321\nSo install state, and then dash.\n\n181\n00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:13.439\nThe EQ for equals and\nput in parentheses available,\n\n182\n00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:18.790\nA-V-A-I-L-A-B-L-E, all right.\n\n183\n00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:25.150\nAnd end our curly bracket there, and\nnow we're gonna pipe that into uninstall.\n\n184\n00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:32.603\nAnd then, Windows Feature.\n\n185\n00:12:32.603 --> 00:12:35.260\nThen I'm gonna have to\ncheck my syntax here.\n\n186\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.470\nAnd then specify remove for all of that.\n\n187\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.850\nBut let me just give that a second.\n\n188\n00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.940\nAnd so I'm typing, get WindowsFeature.\n\n189\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:46.290\nPipe it out to where the object for\nthe install state equals available.\n\n190\n00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.900\nAnd then we'll go ahead,\nand I think I've got.\n\n191\n00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.768\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't hit Enter exactly yet,\nlet's talk about this for a moment.\n\n192\n00:12:51.768 --> 00:12:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what we actually see right\n\n193\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.920\nhere on the command, right, is that\nkeyword there where it says available.\n\n194\n00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.810\nCherokee, what is the goal of removing or\nwhat we're doing here?\n\n195\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.980\nWe're moving the available.\n\n196\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.990\nWhat are we trying to do?\n\n197\n00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwhy would we want to do this, Ronnie?\n\n198\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.800\nSo whenever we did the get-Windows\nfeature earlier and we saw that huge\n\n199\n00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.860\nlaundry list of all the particular roles\nand features that were in this machine.\n\n200\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.075\nIf we wanted to go ahead and\n\n201\n00:13:18.075 --> 00:13:21.100\nremove those off the local disk,\nthen that's what we're saying here.\n\n202\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.070\nWe're saying, look, maybe I have\na handful of rules that are installed on\n\n203\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.500\nthis computer and that's really\nall I need this computer for.\n\n204\n00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.880\nSo let's go ahead and\nget rid of everything else.\n\n205\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.267\nSo now everything that's available,\nwhich means that it's not enabled,\n\n206\n00:13:34.267 --> 00:13:37.180\nit's not installed, let's get rid of it.\n\n207\n00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.580\nSo that's what we're saying right here.\n\n208\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n209\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.570\nSo let's hit Enter.\n\n210\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.650\nAll right, and the term uninstall is\nnot recognized as a name of a cmdlet.\n\n211\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.840\nLet's see, that one should be but\n\n212\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.060\nI might have had an extra space there,\nuninstall dash.\n\n213\n00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.050\n&gt;&gt; Dash.\n&gt;&gt; I missed my dash, that's what it is.\n\n214\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.670\n&gt;&gt; Good old syntax.\n\n215\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.190\nAll right, and then let's hit Enter again.\n\n216\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.240\nAnd so this might just take a few minutes,\nlike a few seconds here also,\n\n217\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.800\nit's not going to take too long.\n\n218\n00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.470\nBut we'll check that.\n\n219\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.730\nAnd like I said, for one machine\nthis may be not really beneficial.\n\n220\n00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.590\nBut in a larger scale that's\nwhere you would see kind of\n\n221\n00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.120\nmore of a benefit when\nwe're talking storage here.\n\n222\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.790\nOr just for, it's not a comprehensive\nsecurity feature here.\n\n223\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.300\nBut I would say it's kind of\nlike a security enhancement.\n\n224\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.260\nBecause the less coding that you have,\neven though they\n\n225\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.140\nare those installation files, that's\nstill potential vulnerabilities as well.\n\n226\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.360\nSo it's just gonna take\na few seconds there.\n\n227\n00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.010\nBut we can start talking\nabout migrations too.\n\n228\n00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.390\nBecause that's something else that we\nhave to think about when discussing\n\n229\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.870\nour rules as well.\n\n230\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.510\nAnd you might be thinking, well,\nmigration, what does that even mean?\n\n231\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:55.110\nSo a migration is going to be when\nwe take, lets say i go ahead and\n\n232\n00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.170\ninstall a particular rule\non a system Like DHCP.\n\n233\n00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:03.550\nSo once I go ahead and get it installed\nand I configure it, I put some time and\n\n234\n00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.110\neffort into that machine.\n\n235\n00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.541\nSo once I already have all\nof my scopes and everything,\n\n236\n00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:13.840\nany kind of reservations or exclusions set\nup, I don't wanna lose that information.\n\n237\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.520\nSo if I'm able to reap\nthe benefits from performing\n\n238\n00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.450\na clean installation\non a brand new server.\n\n239\n00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:25.850\nAnd remember, clean installs,\nit's kind of like getting a nice haircut.\n\n240\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.400\nIt makes you feel clean and fresh.\n\n241\n00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.580\nWe don't have any kind of like residual\nproblems that may be a lingering from\n\n242\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.200\nan in-place upgrade that we may see there.\n\n243\n00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.190\nSo when I take those configuration files,\nright?\n\n244\n00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.540\nAnd I use our migration tools, and I bring\nthem over to that clean installation.\n\n245\n00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.640\nI don't have to go ahead and\nreconfigure that server.\n\n246\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.450\nNow we kind of joked earlier\nin this series about,\n\n247\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:53.360\nhey, there are other ways to do\nthings other than the Microsoft way.\n\n248\n00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.470\nThat's fine and it's true.\n\n249\n00:15:55.470 --> 00:16:01.070\nBut here, utilizing our migration tools,\nit's been tested and it's easy.\n\n250\n00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:05.070\nMicrosoft provides great documentation\nactually If we take a look at my\n\n251\n00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.281\nscreen and this is still\nrunning in the background here.\n\n252\n00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:12.970\nI do wanna show you and this link is\nprovided in the show notes as well.\n\n253\n00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:19.500\nBut Microsoft has great documentation for\ntheir migration deployment guides.\n\n254\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:25.239\nNow It's recommended to go ahead and\nperform one role migration at a time.\n\n255\n00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:29.350\nWe're not talking about doing\nthese migrations in tandem.\n\n256\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:34.133\nSo if you click here, so they have it\nseparated out between server 2012,\n\n257\n00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:37.900\n2012 and 2012 R2, so I'm clicking 2012 R2.\n\n258\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.300\nThey have extensive guides for\nindividual roles.\n\n259\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.790\nYou can see here Active Directory\ncertificate services migration guide.\n\n260\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.820\nAnd so since I mentioned DHCP,\nlet's just click on that one.\n\n261\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:58.591\nMost of these guides are going to have\nthe same type of information in them.\n\n262\n00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:02.276\nSo it's gonna give you a little bit of\ndetailed information about what's in this\n\n263\n00:17:02.276 --> 00:17:05.490\nguide, who the target audience is,\nwhat it does or does not provide.\n\n264\n00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:10.410\nSo here, when you look at DHCP, they're\nsaying hey we're not really talking about\n\n265\n00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.410\nhow to perform this on an environment\nthat has DHCP clustering set up.\n\n266\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.121\nSo we're just looking at\nan individual DHCP server.\n\n267\n00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:25.190\nAnd, I actually have a simple\ndiagram here for, where is it?\n\n268\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:29.490\nFor my, give me one second, make sure\nI get the right screen pulled up.\n\n269\n00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.520\nSo, the high level or\n\n270\n00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.380\nthe generalization that we see here\nis going to be just some basic steps.\n\n271\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.160\nNow granted, it will be different for\neach role that you plan to migrate.\n\n272\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.010\nSo, usually you'll go ahead and\nwhile you always need to install\n\n273\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.871\nthe Windows Server Migrations Tools\non the destination server.\n\n274\n00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:53.420\nThe way you do this is going to be through\nyour add roles and features wizards.\n\n275\n00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.510\nSo you need to make sure that that\nis installed before you go ahead and\n\n276\n00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.290\nuse the installation tools.\n\n277\n00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.870\nAnd then normally you'll\ncreate a deployment folder on\n\n278\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.360\nthe destination server.\n\n279\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.840\nSo for example, if you wanna add a folder\nto your source server that runs a 64-bit\n\n280\n00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.205\ninstall of Server 2012, then you would\ngo ahead and specify that location.\n\n281\n00:18:11.205 --> 00:18:16.830\nSo obviously you need to be\nfamiliar with your environment.\n\n282\n00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.040\nYou need to know the passwords.\n\n283\n00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.520\nYou need to know the locations\nof these folders.\n\n284\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.700\nAnd then you would copy\nthe deployment over.\n\n285\n00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.341\nThe deployment folder over\nto the source server.\n\n286\n00:18:25.341 --> 00:18:29.600\nAnd then you would have to utilize\nthose elevated credentials there.\n\n287\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.420\nBut looking at these steps, I mean it's\npretty much the same for all of these.\n\n288\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.180\nYou go back to the source server and\n\n289\n00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.600\nthen you perform any of those\nrole specific migration tool,\n\n290\n00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.120\nyou know, those particular functions\nthat you need to go ahead and perform.\n\n291\n00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.151\nAnd like I said it might be slightly\ndifferent depending on what role you're\n\n292\n00:18:49.151 --> 00:18:49.920\nutilizing.\n\n293\n00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.887\nNow you're gonna import back\non that destination server,\n\n294\n00:18:53.887 --> 00:18:57.640\nyou use the Import-SmigServerSettings\ncmdlet.\n\n295\n00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.640\nSo once you make sure that you're\nutilizing those migration tools.\n\n296\n00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:08.950\nThere maybe some post migration\nconfiguration that needs to happen.\n\n297\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.020\nJust depending on especially,\nif you have any kind of\n\n298\n00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.890\nauxiliary server running during\nthat interm, during that migration.\n\n299\n00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.160\nJust as a back up,\n\n300\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.200\nif you're not able to have a complete\ndowntime on maintenance windows.\n\n301\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.820\nSo you just have to really plan out for\nyour server migrations here and\n\n302\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.860\nyou're thinking well,\nthat seems like a lot of work.\n\n303\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.720\nBut really, it's a really good way\nto go ahead and get this information\n\n304\n00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.850\non to a clean, a fresh server without\nhaving any potential problems.\n\n305\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.430\nAnd you're not always gonna be able to\nsay hey, maybe I just love upgrades for\n\n306\n00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.560\nsome reason.\n\n307\n00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.065\nBut you may come to find that you're not\nable to perform an upgrade in a certain\n\n308\n00:19:48.065 --> 00:19:48.837\nsituation.\n\n309\n00:19:48.837 --> 00:19:53.925\nSo remember Server 2008 R2\nis when we started seeing\n\n310\n00:19:53.925 --> 00:19:59.620\nthat definitive 64 bit\narchitecture line being drawn.\n\n311\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:07.700\nSo if we have systems older let's just\nsay it's easier to define what can be\n\n312\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:12.830\nupgraded in Server 2012 and\nR's 2012 R2 then what is not.\n\n313\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.230\nSo what I have done here is just\nkind of showed what is not,\n\n314\n00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:20.880\nwhat kind of upgrades are not\nsupported in Server 2012 and 2012 R2.\n\n315\n00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.580\nSo upgrades from versions prior\nto server 2008 are not supported.\n\n316\n00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:32.584\nSo these are situations where,\nrole migration would be your best option.\n\n317\n00:20:32.584 --> 00:20:37.716\nAny kind of operating system that\nwas using pre-RTM, so pre-release\n\n318\n00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:43.890\nto manufacturing, or like any kind of beta\nversions would not be able to be upgraded.\n\n319\n00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:50.299\nAny kinds of upgrades from Windows\nworkstation operating systems obviously.\n\n320\n00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:52.289\nAnd then, you can't cross platforms, so\n\n321\n00:20:52.289 --> 00:20:55.920\nwe're not going 32-bit to\n64-bit in 2012 and 2012 R2.\n\n322\n00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.190\nIt has to be 64-bit like I stressed and\n\n323\n00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.450\nthen also any kind of upgrades\nfrom any deprecated editions.\n\n324\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:08.680\nSo for example for the HPC like we\nspoke about the Itanium editions.\n\n325\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.634\nIf they're not supporting those in 2012\nthen there's no way we can upgrade that.\n\n326\n00:21:13.634 --> 00:21:18.250\nAnd also we're not able to\nsupport cross language upgrades.\n\n327\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.557\nWhich means I can't have you know the\nFrench edition installed on one system and\n\n328\n00:21:22.557 --> 00:21:23.848\nupgrade it to English.\n\n329\n00:21:23.848 --> 00:21:27.513\nSo there are scenarios and\neven think about downgrading,\n\n330\n00:21:27.513 --> 00:21:32.691\nmaybe I need to be a little more frugal\nwith my licensing model, with internally.\n\n331\n00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:34.473\nAnd I need to go ahead and say look,\n\n332\n00:21:34.473 --> 00:21:37.917\nI'm not using this server for\nwhat it was originally planned for,\n\n333\n00:21:37.917 --> 00:21:42.390\nlet me downgrade this I don't need as\nmany licenses for this particular server.\n\n334\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:47.508\nWell then, that's when migration is going\nto be the best solution for us there.\n\n335\n00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:51.997\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, In terms of this\nidea of migrating these, any gotchas,\n\n336\n00:21:51.997 --> 00:21:54.283\nany concerns that we should be aware of?\n\n337\n00:21:54.283 --> 00:21:59.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great observation there Ronnie\nbecause we do need to be aware that\n\n338\n00:21:59.573 --> 00:22:06.264\nthe actual, the server migration tool does\nutilize TCP and UTP ports 7000 by default.\n\n339\n00:22:06.264 --> 00:22:11.045\nSo if you're having any problems with\nthe steps that Microsoft has provided then\n\n340\n00:22:11.045 --> 00:22:14.010\nyou might want and\ncheck your Firewall settings.\n\n341\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.960\nBecause like I said, these steps\nhave worked for a lot of people and\n\n342\n00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.980\nI'm not saying that, you know,\nevery environment is different.\n\n343\n00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.063\nBut that's definitely one of\nthe main things to check if for\n\n344\n00:22:23.063 --> 00:22:27.329\nany kind of troubleshooting there, but\notherwise, yes there are workarounds.\n\n345\n00:22:27.329 --> 00:22:29.777\nBut stick to, at least for now,\n\n346\n00:22:29.777 --> 00:22:35.041\nstick to the Microsoft methodology\nhere and what else is nice because\n\n347\n00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:40.440\nlike I showed you right there on\nTechNet they have those steps.\n\n348\n00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.154\nYou can also delegate rather easily, so\nmaybe like a junior technician can follow\n\n349\n00:22:45.154 --> 00:22:49.867\nthose steps and be able to go ahead and\nperform that function while you're working\n\n350\n00:22:49.867 --> 00:22:52.616\non another project,\nwhich is really cool too.\n\n351\n00:22:52.616 --> 00:22:53.797\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n352\n00:22:53.797 --> 00:22:57.798\nwe were actually in the middle when\nwe started talking about migration,\n\n353\n00:22:57.798 --> 00:23:02.471\nyou were just finishing up something, do\nyou wanna verify that everything is good?\n\n354\n00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:06.167\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I actually kind of typed\nsomething on that PowerShell screen,\n\n355\n00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:10.002\nso what we can do here to verify that\nthat worked, and to check our work now.\n\n356\n00:23:10.002 --> 00:23:16.010\nRemember we were trying to remove all of\nthose available feat rules and features.\n\n357\n00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.728\nSo, what we can do now,\nlike we did at the beginning\n\n358\n00:23:19.728 --> 00:23:23.889\nof the show is we'll just\ntype in get/windowsfeature.\n\n359\n00:23:23.889 --> 00:23:28.202\nAnd at this point in time,\nit will list everything here but\n\n360\n00:23:28.202 --> 00:23:33.610\nnote that the status in that right\ncolumn here they're saying removed.\n\n361\n00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.240\nSo there's nothing that\nshould say available.\n\n362\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.740\nBecause remember when we piped out\nthat information, we were looking for\n\n363\n00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.458\nthat term available to remove\nit to change it to removed.\n\n364\n00:23:42.458 --> 00:23:46.323\nSo the only two options\nshould be installed or\n\n365\n00:23:46.323 --> 00:23:50.020\nremove in that far right hand column here.\n\n366\n00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.540\nAnd I mean if we scroll through the list,\n\n367\n00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.680\nyou'll see that that's\nactually what happens.\n\n368\n00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.380\nSo that's pretty cool right there.\n\n369\n00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.077\nNow you could go back and use that DISM\ntool from the that was the very first\n\n370\n00:24:01.077 --> 00:24:03.476\ncommand that I typed into this show.\n\n371\n00:24:03.476 --> 00:24:05.673\nIf you, really wanted to check and see,\n\n372\n00:24:05.673 --> 00:24:09.945\nwell how much storage did we actually\nsave by going through and doing all that.\n\n373\n00:24:09.945 --> 00:24:13.473\nSo that would be one way to check\nyour work there as well but\n\n374\n00:24:13.473 --> 00:24:17.306\nI think that's about it for\nroles and features for this show.\n\n375\n00:24:17.306 --> 00:24:19.077\nYou're gonna be working with Roles and\n\n376\n00:24:19.077 --> 00:24:22.030\nFeatures throughout the duration\nof this series anyways.\n\n377\n00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:27.820\nThat's kind of the whole focus\nof Server 2012 and 2012 R2.\n\n378\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.567\nBut I think that's a good place\nto go ahead and get started with.\n\n379\n00:24:31.567 --> 00:24:32.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n380\n00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:33.380\nThank you again for\n\n381\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.200\nhelping us to understand a little bit more\nabout installing Roles and Features as\n\n382\n00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.730\nwell as uninstalling them talking a little\nbit about migration here as well.\n\n383\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.270\nBeing able to do it not only in the GUI\nwhich is actually good in terms of\n\n384\n00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.980\nthe installation and removal.\n\n385\n00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.100\nBut also of course in the PowerShell\nsomething that we're all gonna need to\n\n386\n00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.090\nget used to.\n\n387\n00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.390\nSo don't run away from it and\n\n388\n00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.480\nyou'll probably see issues\nlike this on the exam as well.\n\n389\n00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.520\nSo pay attention.\n\n390\n00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.260\nMake sure you go back\nthrough this episode.\n\n391\n00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:03.710\nMaybe even a couple of times as you start\nto get your main study going on there.\n\n392\n00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.300\nBut that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n393\n00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.860\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n394\n00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.604\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n395\n00:25:10.604 --> 00:25:15.035\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore MCSA 70-410

ITPro TV.\n\n3\n00:00:07.488 --> 00:00:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\n\n4\n00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.215\nepisode right here on ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.640\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2,\n\n6\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.770\nspecifically for exam 70-410,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.395\nAnd today we're also gonna be diving into\nthe topic of additional installation\n\n8\n00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.510\nconfigurations.\n\n9\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.430\nAnd here to help us out is\ngonna be Ms Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850\nCherokee, welcome back to the studios.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.680\nYou sounded so\n\n12\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.780\nexcited about our extra additional\ninstallation configurations here.\n\n13\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.142\nAnd I know it's crazy, it seems like\nwe've been talking about installation and\n\n14\n00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:45.880\nconfigurations for a while now, right?\n\n15\n00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.248\nBut the truth of the matter is most\nsystem admins are not performing\n\n16\n00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:54.850\ninstallations every single day, so\nthat is something to consider but\n\n17\n00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.154\nbecause most of you are prepping for an\nexam here, it is important to know those,\n\n18\n00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:05.905\nbecause they're specifically called out\nby Microsoft on those exam objectives.\n\n19\n00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:08.805\nSo I don't wanna skip over any of these.\n\n20\n00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:11.415\nOne that I really would like\nto focus on today, Ronnie,\n\n21\n00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:14.110\nis going to be something\ncalled the DISM tool.\n\n22\n00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.140\nDISM is what we're gonna be looking\nhere and it's part of a tool kit.\n\n23\n00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.746\nIt used to be called AIK but\nthe new name here is going to be\n\n24\n00:01:23.746 --> 00:01:28.161\nWindows Assessment and\nDeployment Kit for our WADK.\n\n25\n00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:33.090\nAnd this particular tool that\nwe'll look at allows us to modify\n\n26\n00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.610\nimages that are offline.\n\n27\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.522\nAnd previously, there was a tool available\nto do that and it was called Image X.\n\n28\n00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:45.630\nWith the advent of Server 2012,\nImage X has been deprecated,\n\n29\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.600\nmeaning that's not the tool that\nMicrosoft recommends to use anymore.\n\n30\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.853\nThey want you to be using the DISM\ntool to perform these functions.\n\n31\n00:01:53.853 --> 00:01:57.832\nNow, adding and removing features is\nnot the only thing you can do with\n\n32\n00:01:57.832 --> 00:02:02.284\nthe DISM tool, but because it's\nspecifically called out by the objectives,\n\n33\n00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:06.214\nthat's what we'll be taking a look at for\nthe majority of this show.\n\n34\n00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:07.732\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Cherokee,\n\n35\n00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:12.286\nwhen we start working with this idea of\nDISM, we wanna begin to make sure that we\n\n36\n00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:16.150\nunderstand where we launch it from,\nand how do we get access to it?\n\n37\n00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.230\nI don't remember actually seeing it very\noften as far as the GUI interface, so\n\n38\n00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.620\nhow do I get to it?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n39\n00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.130\nlet me just log in to this machine\nreal quick and let me just\n\n40\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.730\ngive you a little bit of background\nhistory of what I did on this system.\n\n41\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.750\nLet me delete this feature list,\n\n42\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.650\nthis is something we'll be\ngenerating in a few moments.\n\n43\n00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.800\nI placed a folder called offline\nright here on the root of my C drive.\n\n44\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.190\nThis folder will be utilized as\njust a temporary placeholder for\n\n45\n00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.110\nus to mount our particular image.\n\n46\n00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.080\nI extracted this .win file from\nan ISO that I had downloaded\n\n47\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.350\nfrom Microsoft's site and placed them\nunder my C drive just for easy access.\n\n48\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.990\nThis probably isn't where you'd wanna be\ndoing it in a production environment, but\n\n49\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.940\nless typing for me means less\nheadache watching the show for you.\n\n50\n00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.200\nSo that's why I chose to do that.\n\n51\n00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.870\nNow, where I'm gonna be really\nworking is going to be in PowerShell.\n\n52\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.530\nYou can also use the command prompt here.\n\n53\n00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.860\nActually, a lot of people, just by habit,\nbecause this tool has been around for\n\n54\n00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.450\na bit,\nthey will be using the command prompt.\n\n55\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.940\nBut the more that we're interacting in\nPowerShell, I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.760\nrun this tool straight\nfrom PowerShell here.\n\n57\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.490\nNow, the first thing I want to\ndo is type in the DISM command.\n\n58\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.830\nAnd this is going to be something that\nI'm doing throughout this process.\n\n59\n00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.960\nBecause essentially I'm invoking\nthat DISM.exe by specifying,\n\n60\n00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.344\nprefacing DISM here.\n\n61\n00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:50.509\nNow, we'll type in DISM /Get-ImageInfo.\n\n62\n00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:55.669\nAnd, the reason I'm doing this\nis because that WIM file that\n\n63\n00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:01.134\nI showed you may actually contain\nmultiple operating systems,\n\n64\n00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:05.687\nand I wanna make sure that\nI'm selecting the right one\n\n65\n00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:10.520\nbefore I go through all my work and\nmodify that.\n\n66\n00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.670\nSo I need to specify the path here,\nI will type in image, and\n\n67\n00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.580\nmy location, that's just going to be\n\n68\n00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:28.150\nimagefile:c:\\install the name\nof that file was install,\n\n69\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.980\nso that is why I am typing this here,\nand I'll hit enter.\n\n70\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.030\nAs you can see I have more than one\noperating system on that WIM file.\n\n71\n00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.410\nActually I have four listed here.\n\n72\n00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.330\nI have my standard edition\nthat we'll be working with,\n\n73\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.810\nI have a standard core option,\nI also have down here the server data\n\n74\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.090\ncenter edition as well as the server\ndata center core edition.\n\n75\n00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.410\nSo I really need to make sure I'm\nlooking at our particular name here.\n\n76\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.930\nSo name Windows server 2012\nR2 Standard is what l need to specify,\n\n77\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.310\nbut let me just clear the screen, there is\na lot of typing with this particular tool,\n\n78\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.570\nit's a command line tool so\nl wanna keep things clean for us.\n\n79\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.850\nOkay, so next l need to mount this image,\nso what does mounting even mean, Ronnie?\n\n80\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.400\nWell, I don't have to put this\nimage in a virtual machine and\n\n81\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.480\nspin up that virtual machine to add and\nremove features, or roles,\n\n82\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.310\nor any other changes that I may want to.\n\n83\n00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.360\nWhat this system is doing is allowing\nme to really use that place holder,\n\n84\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.230\nthat offline folder, to serve as a service\npoint to mount those individual files.\n\n85\n00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.480\nSo the operating system has a way\nto really get in that back door and\n\n86\n00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.280\nmanipulate this operating system,\n\n87\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.710\nmy offline image, and allows me to do so\nwithout really bringing it online.\n\n88\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.120\nSo that's great for\nproduction environments,\n\n89\n00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.590\nbecause maybe I am using this image, and\n\n90\n00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.340\nit's not something that I really wanna\nbe bringing offline during the day.\n\n91\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.780\nA lot of times you will be using this\nwith like a Windows deployment system or\n\n92\n00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.410\nthe system centering utilities,\n\n93\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.620\nso it's a really nice tool to\ncomplement those other tools.\n\n94\n00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.395\nAnd you'll learn about those a little\nbit later when you're studying 7412 or\n\n95\n00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:17.768\nif you continue to really focus in on\nsystem center or something like that.\n\n96\n00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:21.898\nAll right, so to go ahead and mount this,\n\n97\n00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:26.146\nlet's take a look here\nback at my screen and\n\n98\n00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:29.568\nwe'll just type in DISM /mount,\n\n99\n00:06:29.568 --> 00:06:35.050\nand then here we'll type in -Image /Image.\n\n100\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.541\nAnd we need to specify\nthe image file location,\n\n101\n00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:47.830\nso ImageFile:C:\\Install.wim,\nsame as before space /.\n\n102\n00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.335\nNow that we know the name, we can type\na name, Colon, now because our name had\n\n103\n00:06:53.335 --> 00:06:59.280\nspaces in it, we need to use quotation\nmarks to encompass that entire name.\n\n104\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.364\nSo let's type in,\n\"windows Server\", All right,\n\n105\n00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:11.620\nand that is going to be 2012.\n\n106\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.712\nMy Num locks wasn't on, R2.\n\n107\n00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:17.720\nNow, we're not finished yet.\n\n108\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.174\nThey had server standard was also,\nS-T-A-N-A-R-D,\n\n109\n00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:26.100\nI just want to make sure they\nhave it typed right here,\n\n110\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.970\notherwise it's going to be problems for\nus.\n\n111\n00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.540\nThe spelling really does matter.\n\n112\n00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.160\nWe're gonna type in / and then we\nneed to specify that mount directory.\n\n113\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.680\nSo mountDir and this is just\nstraight there on our C Drive.\n\n114\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.269\nSo I'm gonna put, again, my :C:\\offline.\n\n115\n00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:50.880\nNow this is that offline\nfolder that I had showed you.\n\n116\n00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.640\nI'm just going to hit Enter.\n\n117\n00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.301\nAnd I have some form of, that error 87\nis a generic error that tells me look,\n\n118\n00:07:57.301 --> 00:07:59.905\nCherokee, you probably have a typo here.\n\n119\n00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:02.412\nSo let me just check my syntax real quick.\n\n120\n00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:08.490\nThis is going to be Dism /Mount-Image\n\n121\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:16.227\n/ImageFile:C:\\install.wim /Name:\",\n\n122\n00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:20.470\ndid I put an end quotation?\n\n123\n00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.578\nLet's see.\nLet me hit my up arrow on my over,\n\n124\n00:08:27.578 --> 00:08:29.070\nTo check.\n\n125\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.092\nI did put it in quotation, okay.\n\n126\n00:08:32.092 --> 00:08:36.010\nSpace /,\nI might not have the space right here.\n\n127\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.900\nIt's hard to tell, but\nthat really will make a difference.\n\n128\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.750\nSo let me try that,\nthat's what it looks like, and hit Enter.\n\n129\n00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.078\nAll right, and that's what it was.\n\n130\n00:08:45.078 --> 00:08:46.027\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Space.\n\n131\n00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:48.230\n&gt;&gt; Space, yeah for spaces.\n\n132\n00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.538\nSo just give it a second here, it's going\nto be mounting that particular image.\n\n133\n00:08:53.538 --> 00:08:54.295\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n134\n00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:58.270\nCherokee as it's mounting, what are we\nactually hoping to end up seeing as\n\n135\n00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:03.279\na result here, once it's mounted.\n&gt;&gt; So whenever this particular image is\n\n136\n00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:08.251\nmounted, this is going to put in\na state from E2 for us to modify it.\n\n137\n00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.729\nAnd it's going to remain in that state\nuntil I explicitly tell the operating\n\n138\n00:09:11.729 --> 00:09:13.210\nsystem, hey, I'm finished.\n\n139\n00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:19.089\nAt that point in time, I will need to make\nthat administrative decision to keep and\n\n140\n00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:21.890\nretain the changes that I have made.\n\n141\n00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.596\nOr if I feel like they were made in error,\nthen I may wanna discard those changes and\n\n142\n00:09:27.596 --> 00:09:32.080\nunmount the particular, ISO and\nthen remounted to fix things.\n\n143\n00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.880\nSo that's the option there.\n\n144\n00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.323\nIt's not anything that's going\nto be happening in real time.\n\n145\n00:09:37.323 --> 00:09:42.016\nIt's just kind of in this strange\nlittle uncommitted relationship\n\n146\n00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:45.380\nuntil we verify that.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is no doubt Cherokee right\n\n147\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.746\nhere and when we start to see that\nmounting process and we were prior ending\n\n148\n00:09:48.746 --> 00:09:52.770\nup seeing here, this is the first time\nyou've kind of looked at this, right?\n\n149\n00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.131\nIs that we're taking whatever was in that\nWIN file underneath that server standard\n\n150\n00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:58.760\nthat Cherokee typed in there.\n\n151\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.131\nAnd we're really putting it\nto a place on her computer,\n\n152\n00:10:03.131 --> 00:10:07.400\nwhich is that C offline,\nI was trying to remember.\n\n153\n00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.690\nThat folder, and that gives us\nthe access point into just that image.\n\n154\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.043\nWithout Cherokee having to install that\ncomputer we will now have access to\n\n155\n00:10:16.043 --> 00:10:17.156\nthe system files.\n\n156\n00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:20.893\nAnd that means we can also at\nthe point do what Cherokee's gonna\n\n157\n00:10:20.893 --> 00:10:24.998\nhelp us do next which of course\nis some type of modification.\n\n158\n00:10:24.998 --> 00:10:29.019\nSo Cherokee, let' talk about what we're\nactually going to to end up trying to see\n\n159\n00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:31.900\nhere, cuz I know there are still\nseveral commands for us.\n\n160\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.151\nSo what are we hoping to do\nonce we've mounted the image?\n\n161\n00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.850\nAnd maybe the mounting\nwill finish by that point.\n\n162\n00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.683\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay,\n\n163\n00:10:38.683 --> 00:10:42.730\nlooks like it just finished, but it's\nimportant to note what we are doing here.\n\n164\n00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.860\nSo the first thing is we're working\nwith a particular operating system.\n\n165\n00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.886\nAnd as you already know that we're\ndealing with features and roles, and\n\n166\n00:10:49.886 --> 00:10:53.468\nthey're stored and\nthat SxS file within the operating system.\n\n167\n00:10:53.468 --> 00:10:57.260\nSo we wanna take a look and get an idea\nof what it is we're working with.\n\n168\n00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.055\nMaybe I didn't create\nthat particular image, so\n\n169\n00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:04.110\nI'm not sure what's actually enabled or\ndisabled or installed.\n\n170\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.474\nSo we'll take a look and\nthen we'll follow Microsoft's objectives\n\n171\n00:11:07.474 --> 00:11:10.494\nby actually enabling a feature offline,\nwe'll disable it.\n\n172\n00:11:10.494 --> 00:11:14.766\nAnd then I'll throw in a couple more\nthat are probably just gonna help you\n\n173\n00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:18.230\nin real life there, Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's get to it.\n\n174\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.846\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n175\n00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:23.318\nI'm going to be using my up area\na little bit, and I'll show you why.\n\n176\n00:11:23.318 --> 00:11:28.684\nA lot of the particular commands that\nI'm using have the same syntax intially,\n\n177\n00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:31.020\nbut there is some modifications.\n\n178\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.699\nOkay, I just lied because-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n179\n00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:34.554\n&gt;&gt; The first one is different,\n\n180\n00:11:34.554 --> 00:11:36.050\nyou only mount once.\n\n181\n00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.580\nAnd here's the thing, if you try to\nremount, it will not let you at this time.\n\n182\n00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.926\nBecause I'm occupying that offline folder,\nand I can't remount,\n\n183\n00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:45.032\nI can only mount once.\n\n184\n00:11:45.032 --> 00:11:50.080\nAll right, so for this one I'm gonna\ntype in DISM, which I already here.\n\n185\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.140\nSo you know what?\n\n186\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.255\nLet's just fully type in DISM.\n\n187\n00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:57.184\nSo DISM /Image, and here,\n\n188\n00:11:57.184 --> 00:12:02.589\nwe're gonna type in :C: \\offline,\n\n189\n00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:09.649\njust specifying again that location\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this is a good point for\n\n190\n00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:13.207\nus to kind of help out the person\nthat's really beginning, right?\n\n191\n00:12:13.207 --> 00:12:17.160\nIs remember that Cherokee is not\nmounting the image itself right now.\n\n192\n00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.410\nBut this folder where she said, hey,\nthis is where I'm gonna mount it from.\n\n193\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.300\nSo that's why this is important\nthat we get the syntax right.\n\n194\n00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.600\nAnd you notice it is not mounting\nthe image called install.wim.\n\n195\n00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.945\nIt is actually mounting that\nimage that server stand,\n\n196\n00:12:31.945 --> 00:12:35.300\nwhich I can't remember inside\nof the offline folder.\n\n197\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.950\nAnd that's a key point that we\nwanna make sure that we emphasize.\n\n198\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.210\n&gt;&gt; You got it, Ronnie.\n\n199\n00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.913\nNow this part, the syntax that you see\nright here is gonna stay the same for\n\n200\n00:12:42.913 --> 00:12:46.816\nthe majority of the commands that we\nwill be executing throughout this show.\n\n201\n00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:51.100\nBut this next parameter needs\nto be a little different.\n\n202\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.417\nSo I'm gonna to type in /Git-Features,\nfeatures,\n\n203\n00:12:56.417 --> 00:13:03.250\nthis one's funny here because\nin PowerShell, it's get-feature.\n\n204\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:09.310\nHere in the DISM tool, it's Git-Features,\nso just be aware of that, we'll hit Enter.\n\n205\n00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:13.790\nThis will take a second to propagate and\ngenerate that list for\n\n206\n00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.930\nus of all the different features\nthat are on this system.\n\n207\n00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.220\nIf the features have been removed,\nthen they're not gonna be displayed.\n\n208\n00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.217\nIf the features are disabled, you'll still\nsee them noted as you do here as this\n\n209\n00:13:26.217 --> 00:13:28.940\nstate has the Disabled notification.\n\n210\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.440\nIt will also say enabled if it is there.\n\n211\n00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.700\nNow, I know this is hard to read and\n\n212\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.140\nlook at,\nlet me just clear this screen real quick.\n\n213\n00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.645\nSomething that you could do\nto make it a little easier\n\n214\n00:13:41.645 --> 00:13:46.104\nto sift through all those rules and\nfeatures, if I hit my up arrow,\n\n215\n00:13:46.104 --> 00:13:49.390\nit'll bring back that\ncommand that I just used.\n\n216\n00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.064\nAnd by using my little carrot here or\n\n217\n00:13:53.064 --> 00:13:57.968\ngreater than symbol,\nI can create a text file.\n\n218\n00:13:57.968 --> 00:14:04.810\nAnd I'm going to actually export that,\nI'm trying to see if I need a space here.\n\n219\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.622\nI'm not sure, let's try it.\n\n220\n00:14:05.622 --> 00:14:10.451\nSo C:\\ and\nwe'll distract that right on the root, and\n\n221\n00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:17.260\nwe'll name this list for our feature list,\nthen give it a .txt and hit Enter.\n\n222\n00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.010\nGive it a second there,\nnow let's check under our C drive.\n\n223\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.575\nThis is that list that we just created and\nnow you can see everything,\n\n224\n00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:32.710\nin fact, that is enabled or disabled\non that image that we are working with.\n\n225\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.170\nAnd Ronnie, this is great because if\nI wanted to hand this off to you and\n\n226\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.412\ndelegate further on or\nsomething like that and I made my changes.\n\n227\n00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:41.664\nAnd I just wanted to show you that,\n\n228\n00:14:41.664 --> 00:14:45.394\nI could save this file and\nshare it with my IT department or\n\n229\n00:14:45.394 --> 00:14:49.810\njust keep it as documentation\nperhaps as auditing purposes.\n\n230\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.680\nSo that's just one thing\nyou could do with that.\n\n231\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.676\n&gt;&gt; This is also nice because the very\n\n232\n00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:58.180\nfact is, if we try to enable or disable\na feature, we might need that name.\n\n233\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.990\nAnd some of those names are not\nexactly the easiest ones to remember.\n\n234\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.871\nSo having that on the file, the nice thing\nI like about it is it'll give me that\n\n235\n00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:09.754\nability to go down and copy it [LAUGH]\ninto the clipboard, and then paste it into\n\n236\n00:15:09.754 --> 00:15:12.463\nthe command when I need it.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I like to do.\n\n237\n00:15:12.463 --> 00:15:13.954\n&gt;&gt; That would be the smart thing to do.\n\n238\n00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:15.643\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I like.\n\n239\n00:15:15.643 --> 00:15:16.409\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Unlike me,\n\n240\n00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:19.420\nI'll just keep shuffling\nthrough my typos here.\n\n241\n00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.988\nLike I said, this first portion,\nI'm just gonna keep that here.\n\n242\n00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:28.737\nIt's DISM /Image specifying that C drive,\nthe offline folder,\n\n243\n00:15:28.737 --> 00:15:33.254\nbut now we're actually going\nto type in / enable and\n\n244\n00:15:33.254 --> 00:15:36.660\nhere I'm gonna be enabling a feature.\n\n245\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.898\nIf I type in feature, although it\nmay actually be considered a role.\n\n246\n00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:44.081\nRemember, sometimes the operating\nsystem just groups them together and\n\n247\n00:15:44.081 --> 00:15:45.369\ncalls them features.\n\n248\n00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:50.721\nEnable-Feature /FeatureName, and\nthis is where Ronnie was saying, hey,\n\n249\n00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:56.249\nthis is why I wanna have that list because\nsometimes you might not remember them.\n\n250\n00:15:56.249 --> 00:16:01.520\nFeature name and also the display name\nmay be different from the feature name.\n\n251\n00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.020\nWhen you're working in PowerShell and\n\n252\n00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.250\nyou'll start to recognize that there\nare some that are different so.\n\n253\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:12.630\nThe feature name here that we want\nto install is going to just be TFTP.\n\n254\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:19.590\nSo TFTP, and\nwe'll add the all parameter here.\n\n255\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.960\nSo, our trivial file transfer protocol\nis what we're gonna be enabling and\n\n256\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.260\nI'll just hit enter here.\n\n257\n00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.705\nGive it a second, you'll also see\nthat little progression bar, okay,\n\n258\n00:16:31.705 --> 00:16:33.207\nthat was pretty quick.\n\n259\n00:16:33.207 --> 00:16:37.393\nAnd now if I wanna check\nthe status on that,\n\n260\n00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:41.578\nlet me just go back and\nhit the up arrow, and\n\n261\n00:16:41.578 --> 00:16:46.015\nI'm going to change this\nfrom enable to get.\n\n262\n00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:47.791\nAnd is there anything\nelse I need to change?\n\n263\n00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:51.530\nYou know what, I really don't need the all\nparameter, so I could take that off.\n\n264\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.260\nBut once I hit enter,\n\n265\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.390\nthis is going to give me the status\nof that particular feature.\n\n266\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.420\nNow something that's important to know,\n\n267\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.870\nsometimes whenever I am modifying\na feature, whether it be enabling or\n\n268\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:09.330\ndisabling it,\nwe are not completely finished yet.\n\n269\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.177\nThere's nothing else that we\nneed to do administratively, but\n\n270\n00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:18.167\nthe operating system won't recognize\nthat change as being 100% solidified or\n\n271\n00:17:18.167 --> 00:17:20.744\ncomplete until the image actually boots.\n\n272\n00:17:20.744 --> 00:17:23.826\nSo that's just something that\nyou might wanna notice there.\n\n273\n00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:27.706\nAnd, I got an error here, what happened?\n&gt;&gt; Instead of get dash feature I\n\n274\n00:17:27.706 --> 00:17:31.070\nthink it’s supposed to be get dash\nfeature info is what happened.\n\n275\n00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.284\n&gt;&gt; I always do that, Ronnie.\n\n276\n00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:32.954\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:17:32.954 --> 00:17:35.183\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it is, so let me go ahead and\n\n278\n00:17:35.183 --> 00:17:40.070\ntype in info here, and that will give\nus the info that we have requested.\n\n279\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.050\nOkay, so here it is, feature information.\n\n280\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.940\nYou can see the feature name.\n\n281\n00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.010\nNow this is what I was talking about\nhere with that feature name is TFTP.\n\n282\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.160\nHowever, the display name is TFTP client,\nso\n\n283\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.510\nthere are some slight discrepancies\nthat you might just want to note there.\n\n284\n00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.710\nNow this is also what I was referencing,\nfor that restart required, it says hey,\n\n285\n00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.660\npossibly, there could possibly\nbe a restart required.\n\n286\n00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.360\nSo my job is done here if I\nwanted to enable that feature,\n\n287\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.860\nbut the operating system\nstill has some work to do.\n\n288\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.400\nLet me clear the screen and\nwe'll move onto our next function.\n\n289\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.590\nLet's see, what do we wanna do next?\n\n290\n00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.590\nOkay, let's remove something.\n\n291\n00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:25.521\nIf you recall the different types\nof operating system states that we\n\n292\n00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.173\nhave available to us.\n\n293\n00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:31.788\nRemember, there were a couple\ndifferent commands that we could\n\n294\n00:18:31.788 --> 00:18:35.461\nuse like our server,\nit was the server GUI shell and\n\n295\n00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:40.853\nthe server GUI management command list\nthat we were talking about before.\n\n296\n00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:44.336\nSo if I just wanted to bring it to\nthat minimal interface or something,\n\n297\n00:18:44.336 --> 00:18:46.150\nI could use this to remove it.\n\n298\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.860\nThe reason I'm choosing this one,\nand you guys, from that list,\n\n299\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.450\nyou saw most of those\nfeatures were disabled.\n\n300\n00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.230\nI didn't have a lot enabled on this one.\n\n301\n00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:58.450\nSo it's really up to you and\nhowever maybe your boss or\n\n302\n00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.030\nwhomever is telling you what you\nneed to set that system up as.\n\n303\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.480\nBut let's just go ahead and\nget to it here.\n\n304\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.421\nSo, I will type in the up arrow and\nwe'll go back a little bit here,\n\n305\n00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:10.910\njust to this portion right here.\n\n306\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.474\nNow, we're gonna type in disable, so\n\n307\n00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:20.894\nthis is disable-feature,\nSpace feature name.\n\n308\n00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:28.998\nAnd here our feature name\nis going to be colon and\n\n309\n00:19:28.998 --> 00:19:35.693\nthen you type in server-GUI-,\nnot underscore mgmt.\n\n310\n00:19:35.693 --> 00:19:40.425\nNotice there is not any kind of dash\ninfer like you maybe familiar with\n\n311\n00:19:40.425 --> 00:19:42.145\nworking in PowerShell.\n\n312\n00:19:42.145 --> 00:19:47.490\nBut that's the actual feature name here,\nso that's why it's important to note that.\n\n313\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.100\nSo we're disabling this feature,\nagain we've got our progression bar,\n\n314\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.808\nwe can also hit, okay it's giving\na little blinking cursor here,\n\n315\n00:19:56.808 --> 00:19:58.420\nlet me just give it a second to think.\n\n316\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.180\nWe can hit our up arrow to\ninvoke that get information, so\n\n317\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.780\nyou gotta wait until\nthis line comes back up.\n\n318\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.921\nGetting too antsy here.\n\n319\n00:20:10.245 --> 00:20:11.432\nWhere's my get feature?\n\n320\n00:20:11.432 --> 00:20:15.629\nAnd then I have to add the info because,\nremember Ronnie called me out on that,\n\n321\n00:20:15.629 --> 00:20:16.657\nget feature info.\n\n322\n00:20:20.368 --> 00:20:24.860\nLets change that server feature name\nto the one that we just disabled.\n\n323\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:30.715\nSo that is going to be\nserver-GUI-mgmt we'll hit enter, and\n\n324\n00:20:30.715 --> 00:20:37.318\njust to check the status on that as well.\n&gt;&gt; Now\n\n325\n00:20:37.318 --> 00:20:40.932\nwhen we are looking at the status here\nCherokee, what are we really looking for\n\n326\n00:20:40.932 --> 00:20:42.927\nthat shows us that we've now disabled it?\n\n327\n00:20:42.927 --> 00:20:47.145\nIt says right here the state\nis being disabled, and\n\n328\n00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:52.551\nthat's just my Hyper-V,\nnot Hyper-V, I'm in VMWare today.\n\n329\n00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:55.105\nBut that's just what\nyou guys saw pop down.\n\n330\n00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:57.120\nThis is what Rodney was asking about.\n\n331\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.690\nThat state is noted as being disabled.\n\n332\n00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.550\nYou did see the progression bar,\nand it said it was complete.\n\n333\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.310\nI might be a little bit paranoid for\nchecking,\n\n334\n00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:10.200\nbut I think that it's kind of a good\npractice or at least in the beginning, or\n\n335\n00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.280\nmaybe even always, just to get in\nthe habit of checking your work there.\n\n336\n00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.960\nAnd that's really all I'm doing\nis showing you how to do that.\n\n337\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.410\nBut it does say that there\npotentially requires a restart there.\n\n338\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.040\nSo you might just wanna note that as well.\n\n339\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.040\nLet me clear this screen here,\nwe were taking a lot of space, so\n\n340\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.965\nlet's just clean it up.\n\n341\n00:21:28.965 --> 00:21:32.050\nAnd the next thing that I wanna do is\n\n342\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.100\nshow you the difference between\ndisabling and removing something.\n\n343\n00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:41.710\nSo when we disable it, the actual source\nfiles are still retained on that image.\n\n344\n00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.741\nIf I wanted to reduce the storage or\nthe footprint on the actual image.\n\n345\n00:21:45.741 --> 00:21:48.701\nI can remove them completely,\nand that's what we’ll do here.\n\n346\n00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:52.733\nAnd it’s kind of funny, the syntax here,\n\n347\n00:21:52.733 --> 00:21:57.219\nyou’re still using,\nokay not get feature ML.\n\n348\n00:21:57.219 --> 00:22:02.979\nYou’re still using that disable feature\nportion, but let me go back and\n\n349\n00:22:02.979 --> 00:22:08.280\nchange., we’re not gonna be\ndisabling server GUI management.\n\n350\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.706\nWe're going to be disabling telnet client,\nso let's type in telnet client.\n\n351\n00:22:10.706 --> 00:22:15.829\nSo that parts the same,\nwhere it differs, so if you're actually\n\n352\n00:22:15.829 --> 00:22:20.777\nremoving something,\nyou type in space forward slash remove.\n\n353\n00:22:23.325 --> 00:22:28.751\nDisabling is less invasive, so this is\nsomething to consider you would need\n\n354\n00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:34.373\naccess to the source files if you need\nto restore that removed role or feature.\n\n355\n00:22:34.373 --> 00:22:38.105\nAll right, so it just took a second,\nthere it is 100%.\n\n356\n00:22:38.105 --> 00:22:41.650\nYou guys have already seen me check that\nfeature so I won't go through it again.\n\n357\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.780\nI will note the syntax to restore.\n\n358\n00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.250\nIf I had removed something but because\nI haven't remove anything previously\n\n359\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.350\nthere's nothing really to show there.\n\n360\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.208\nBut the difference would be,\nlet's say I have in fact removed that\n\n361\n00:22:57.208 --> 00:23:01.219\ntelenet client and\nI wanted to bring it back this time.\n\n362\n00:23:01.219 --> 00:23:03.060\nInstead of typing remove,\n\n363\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.871\nI would actually need to first of all\nwe would change disable to enable.\n\n364\n00:23:14.603 --> 00:23:18.802\nAnd at the end I would have to specify\nthe source for those source files so,\n\n365\n00:23:18.802 --> 00:23:21.059\nforward slash and then source, oops.\n\n366\n00:23:25.417 --> 00:23:28.693\nAnd for my source, probably I\nwould have put it on my C drive.\n\n367\n00:23:28.693 --> 00:23:33.956\nSo we'll just say C:, and then you would\nfill in the rest of that local path there.\n\n368\n00:23:33.956 --> 00:23:39.109\nOr if you were using the UNC path there\nif you were accessing it via network.\n\n369\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.941\nSo I wanted to show you that and\n\n370\n00:23:41.941 --> 00:23:45.339\nI think there is two more things\nI wanted to show here as well.\n\n371\n00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:49.118\nSomething that's really isn't\ncalled out on the objectives but\n\n372\n00:23:49.118 --> 00:23:53.999\nI think it's super important just to know\nthat it's available because it's really\n\n373\n00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:59.150\ncommon To be using answer files with any\nkind of remote or automatic deployments.\n\n374\n00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:02.130\nSo let's take a look at how\nwe could create an answer\n\n375\n00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.640\nfile.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee, since you\n\n376\n00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.960\nmentioned it, what is an answer file?\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\n\n377\n00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.770\nan answer file is a file that we\ncan create, an XML file that I can\n\n378\n00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:18.840\nreally allow the operating system to\nget any kind of questions and answers\n\n379\n00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.530\nit may require during that installation\nwithout a human being present.\n\n380\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:29.600\nSo it really makes work a lot easier for\nthose remote unattended installations.\n\n381\n00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.205\nSo the first portion of my command,\nlike I had mentioned before,\n\n382\n00:24:34.205 --> 00:24:36.982\nwill be the same for this offline part.\n\n383\n00:24:36.982 --> 00:24:37.899\nBut we will need to change.\n\n384\n00:24:37.899 --> 00:24:42.150\nHere, we're going to add a dash,\nforward slash I should say.\n\n385\n00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.120\nAnd this is going to be an applied dash,\nI think.\n\n386\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.195\nLet me just check, yep.\n\n387\n00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:48.130\nThat's a dash and then unattend.\n\n388\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:53.170\nSo here,\nwe're gonna type in apply dash unattend.\n\n389\n00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:00.436\nThe next thing is to specify where that,\ngeez,\n\n390\n00:25:00.436 --> 00:25:07.270\nmy finger wants to put a semi-colon there,\nit needs to be a colon.\n\n391\n00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.470\nI need to specify where that\nXML file is residing, so\n\n392\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.342\nthat's what I'm doing right now.\n\n393\n00:25:14.342 --> 00:25:19.669\nSo if I had a folder named XML files,\nor something like that,\n\n394\n00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:23.650\nsitting there on the root\nof my C drive there.\n\n395\n00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:29.200\nAnd then I would just need to also say,\n\n396\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.328\nthisismyxml.xml.\n\n397\n00:25:32.328 --> 00:25:35.160\nNot like you will ever have\na file name that ridiculous.\n\n398\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.811\nBut I am just specifying that's the path.\n&gt;&gt; Traditionally right,\n\n399\n00:25:37.811 --> 00:25:39.600\nthey were using this idea as answer file.\n\n400\n00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.530\nWe normally call it\nunattend of some sort and\n\n401\n00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.760\nthat is because of what\nCherokee mentioned.\n\n402\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.994\nIt is because we want to actually make\nthat install go without any human\n\n403\n00:25:48.994 --> 00:25:49.935\ninteraction.\n\n404\n00:25:49.935 --> 00:25:52.652\nAnd that's probably kinda the most\nintuitive way to do so, but\n\n405\n00:25:52.652 --> 00:25:54.200\nyou can place it wherever you want.\n\n406\n00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.720\nThe key, though,\nis to remember where you place it.\n\n407\n00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.399\nI know I've created many of these and\n\n408\n00:25:58.399 --> 00:26:01.820\nthen I just said I don't even remember\nwhere I actually created that file.\n\n409\n00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.180\nThen you have to go and look for it, or\n\n410\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.860\nif you're like me you just recreate it\nto actually know where to look for it.\n\n411\n00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:11.131\nSo these files are very important,\nespecially if you are actually assigned\n\n412\n00:26:11.131 --> 00:26:14.019\nthe task of doing an unattended install.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n413\n00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:16.452\nnow here comes the if you're\na commitment-phobe and\n\n414\n00:26:16.452 --> 00:26:19.816\nyou don't wanna ever commit to anything,\nyou might have a problem here.\n\n415\n00:26:19.816 --> 00:26:21.784\nThis is our last step.\n\n416\n00:26:21.784 --> 00:26:24.304\n[LAUGH] Because we need to commit.\n\n417\n00:26:24.304 --> 00:26:28.659\nOtherwise, the operating system thinks\nwe're still modifying this image and,\n\n418\n00:26:28.659 --> 00:26:30.120\nwell, it won't unmount.\n\n419\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.360\nSo let's type in DISM, then let's see.\n\n420\n00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.416\nThe actual command is space,\n\n421\n00:26:36.416 --> 00:26:41.940\nforward slash unmount,\nand image, dash image.\n\n422\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.750\nHowever, let's see.\n\n423\n00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.575\nWe have to specify the mount directory.\n\n424\n00:26:46.575 --> 00:26:52.185\nSo /MountDir:C: and\nthis is still in my same place.\n\n425\n00:26:52.185 --> 00:26:55.312\nWe have to specify that location for\noffline.\n\n426\n00:26:55.312 --> 00:26:58.615\nNow this is where the big\nconundrum comes in.\n\n427\n00:26:58.615 --> 00:26:59.740\n&gt;&gt; You have three Fs there.\n\n428\n00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.586\n[LAUGH] That's not gonna work.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, that's not gonna work.\n\n429\n00:27:03.586 --> 00:27:10.270\nAll right, so here my options are either\ngoing to be to commit or to discard.\n\n430\n00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:15.148\nSo I could type in forward slash commit,\nif I wanted to commit, and\n\n431\n00:27:15.148 --> 00:27:19.067\nsave these changes, so\nthat it would be ready to go for\n\n432\n00:27:19.067 --> 00:27:22.218\nme whenever I actually wanted to use that.\n\n433\n00:27:22.218 --> 00:27:27.787\nOr I would have some kind of\ncommitment issue and hit discard,\n\n434\n00:27:27.787 --> 00:27:32.960\nand that's all she wrote.\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n435\n00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.940\nwell, thank you again for helping us to\nunderstand a little bit more about using\n\n436\n00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.046\nthe DISM tool to help us to be able\nto modify these offline images.\n\n437\n00:27:42.046 --> 00:27:45.253\nThis is an important process that\nyou'll have to make sure you understand\n\n438\n00:27:45.253 --> 00:27:46.290\nfor the exam.\n\n439\n00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.567\nThere are many different ways\nthat you can think about this,\n\n440\n00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:53.304\none make sure you pay attention to\nthe sequencing of things, right?\n\n441\n00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:56.653\nYou can't really modify an image,\noffline or even online,\n\n442\n00:27:56.653 --> 00:27:59.030\nunless you've already got it somewhere.\n\n443\n00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:03.401\nSo make sure you pay attention to the fact\nthat you have to mount the image first,\n\n444\n00:28:03.401 --> 00:28:05.164\nthen you can make the changes and\n\n445\n00:28:05.164 --> 00:28:08.117\nthen commit those changes at\nthe end if you choose to.\n\n446\n00:28:08.117 --> 00:28:11.824\nThe other thing to also remember that\nwhat you saw here is that Cherokee showed\n\n447\n00:28:11.824 --> 00:28:15.830\nus how we could enable a feature, as well\nas disable it and also remove a feature.\n\n448\n00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.181\nThose two are different.\n\n449\n00:28:17.181 --> 00:28:20.930\nDisabling and remove,\nmake sure you pay attention there as well.\n\n450\n00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.377\nThese are all scenario like bases that\nyou're likely to see on the exam, so\n\n451\n00:28:25.377 --> 00:28:26.868\ndon't gloss over this.\n\n452\n00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:31.005\nAnd even if the typing is a little bit\ncomplex or challenging, it's worth you\n\n453\n00:28:31.005 --> 00:28:35.480\ntaking the time to go through, because\nyou're gonna see this over and over again.\n\n454\n00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.704\nThis tool is kind of a major part of us\ncreating images and getting them ready for\n\n455\n00:28:39.704 --> 00:28:40.480\ndeployment.\n\n456\n00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.307\nAnd also, I forgot, but Cherokee, you\nhad mentioned the idea of the unattend.\n\n457\n00:28:44.307 --> 00:28:47.486\nMake sure you actually know where\nthat's gonna also be saved, and\n\n458\n00:28:47.486 --> 00:28:49.375\nwhy we would choose to use that as well.\n\n459\n00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:53.358\nSo that is a great place for\nus to also sign off for this episode, but\n\n460\n00:28:53.358 --> 00:28:55.630\nthere are more features to come.\n\n461\n00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.376\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n462\n00:28:59.376 --> 00:29:00.042\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n463\n00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:03.827\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n464\n00:29:03.827 --> 00:29:09.601\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n465\n00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:11.823\n[MUSIC]\n\n466\n00:29:11.823 --> 00:29:14.343\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:06.466\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.274\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:12.343\nYou're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.343 --> 00:00:15.939\nWelcome to another great\nepisodes right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.087\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R-2,\n\n8\n00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.599\nspecifically on exam 70-410.\n\n9\n00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.174\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\nwe're taking a look at well\n\n10\n00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:29.606\nsome additional installation\nconfigurations here.\n\n11\n00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:33.424\n[LAUGH] We're gonna take a look at one\nwhich was using of course the DISM\n\n12\n00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:37.389\ntool and now we've got a couple of\nother that we've also want to tackle.\n\n13\n00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:40.475\nAnd here to help us out of course is\ncontinuing with us Cherokee Boose.\n\n14\n00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:41.562\nCherokee, how are you doing?\n\n15\n00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:42.819\nI'm doing great, Ronnie.\n\n16\n00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.275\nAnd you say it like there's no\nindent site, but there really is.\n\n17\n00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:51.137\nI promise there's only two additional\ninstallation configurations that we'll be\n\n18\n00:00:51.137 --> 00:00:52.578\nlooking at in this show.\n\n19\n00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:57.665\nAnd this is going to be wrapping up\nthat first section of the objectives for\n\n20\n00:00:57.665 --> 00:00:58.411\nthe exam.\n\n21\n00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:01.785\nSo we just wanna make sure that we are\ntaking the time to cover each one of these\n\n22\n00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:03.800\nand make sure you have\na good understanding.\n\n23\n00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.112\nThe first concept I'd like to introduce\nis something called Delegation and\n\n24\n00:01:09.112 --> 00:01:10.697\ndelegation is great.\n\n25\n00:01:10.697 --> 00:01:16.718\nIf we're in a working environment it's\nnice to be able to delegate things, right?\n\n26\n00:01:16.718 --> 00:01:20.090\nSo we don't rely on Cherokee or\nRonnie to do everything,\n\n27\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.861\nwe can give some delegation.\n\n28\n00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:26.820\nAnd this is really nice if we have someone\nwho has some sort of IT background,\n\n29\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.698\nespecially for working with remote sites.\n\n30\n00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:33.178\nAnd we're not always able to be\nthere assisting and guiding them,\n\n31\n00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:35.239\nwe can actually give some delegation.\n\n32\n00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:37.648\nSo let's take a look at\nhow we would do that.\n\n33\n00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:39.173\nIf we take a look at my screen,\n\n34\n00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:41.919\nI'm just going to be pulling\nup some server manager.\n\n35\n00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:45.079\nNow, it is important to note\nthat I've pre-installed\n\n36\n00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.972\nActive Directory Domain Services\non this system,\n\n37\n00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:51.281\notherwise I'm not gonna be\nable to utilize this feature.\n\n38\n00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:55.656\nSo under my Tools I will\nselect my Users and Computers.\n\n39\n00:01:58.021 --> 00:01:59.914\nLet's just make that\na little bit larger and\n\n40\n00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:02.794\nexpand this out so we can really\nsee what we're working with here.\n\n41\n00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:06.926\nI've already created my\nITProdemo.com domain.\n\n42\n00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:11.963\nSo from here you can see the different\ncomponents that I already have.\n\n43\n00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:17.477\nI have all of my users listed\nhere over on the right hand side.\n\n44\n00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:21.170\nAnd whenever I create an OU,\nan Organizational Unit,\n\n45\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.701\nit looks like a folder but\nlet me see if I can zoom in and\n\n46\n00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:27.616\nshow you here from my domain controllers.\n\n47\n00:02:27.616 --> 00:02:31.592\nThere's a tiny little,\nI don't even know what that is, Ronnie,\n\n48\n00:02:31.592 --> 00:02:34.226\nit just looks like\na darker rectangle to me.\n\n49\n00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:38.585\nBut that's really signifying what\nan organizational unit is there.\n\n50\n00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:43.636\nAnd an organizational unit will allow\nmore granular administration for me.\n\n51\n00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:48.540\nSo, something that I may wanna do\nhere is to actually just to create\n\n52\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.480\nan organizational unit.\n\n53\n00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.038\nBut it really depends on what you want\nto be allowing that delegation for.\n\n54\n00:02:56.038 --> 00:03:00.674\nSo let's see,\nmaybe if there's a particular computer or\n\n55\n00:03:00.674 --> 00:03:03.520\nsomething that I wanted to create.\n\n56\n00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.226\nThere's nothing in here currently.\n\n57\n00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:08.905\nSo just from our domain here,\nI will right click and\n\n58\n00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:13.541\nI will select New and\nI'll select an Organizational Unit here.\n\n59\n00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:18.464\nSo let's say Ronnie was the HR manager but\nhe used to work in IT.\n\n60\n00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:25.084\nSo he got fired from ITProTV and he's\nnow the HR person here at this company.\n\n61\n00:03:25.084 --> 00:03:29.056\nSo we'll just say Human Resources for\nthis particular,\n\n62\n00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:31.880\nnot humus or whatever I'm typing here.\n\n63\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.664\nHumus?\n\n64\n00:03:32.664 --> 00:03:33.346\n[LAUGH] It looks like it.\n\n65\n00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.814\nI think you're hungry.\n\n66\n00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:38.227\nI think I am too.\n\n67\n00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:42.126\nThey won't feed me until I finish this\nshow so I'm hoping all goes well.\n\n68\n00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:46.932\n[LAUGH] All right, so I'm creating\nthis Organizational Unit that I can\n\n69\n00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:50.197\nthen at this point give\ncontrol over to Ronnie.\n\n70\n00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.535\nSomething to note here,\nthis kind of hangs,\n\n71\n00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:55.364\ngets people caught up with\nthis little tick mark here,\n\n72\n00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:59.315\nbecause maybe I did type in Humus and\nI didn't realize it until afterwards.\n\n73\n00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:02.251\nI'm like, Humus Resources,\nwhat does that even mean?\n\n74\n00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:03.763\nBut if I unchecked this,\n\n75\n00:04:03.763 --> 00:04:08.668\nit means I can delete this organizational\nunit easily by just right-clicking.\n\n76\n00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:11.232\nSo Microsoft said, hey, you know what?\n\n77\n00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:12.954\nMaybe they had a lot of complaints or\nsomething,\n\n78\n00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:14.472\nI don't know why they added this feature.\n\n79\n00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:18.675\nBut it's a little option to protect\nthis container from accidental deletion.\n\n80\n00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.277\nSo we'll hit OK.\n\n81\n00:04:20.277 --> 00:04:24.801\nAnd now I just wanted to point that\nout because it can be troublesome to\n\n82\n00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:27.297\nsome admins here because if you know,\n\n83\n00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:31.901\nand if I really try to right-click and\ndelete this and select delete.\n\n84\n00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:34.656\nI get a little notification,\nhey are you sure you want to delete it?\n\n85\n00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:36.157\nAnd I think everything is going great.\n\n86\n00:04:36.157 --> 00:04:37.755\nAnd I'm like, yeah, sure, delete it.\n\n87\n00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:41.946\nAnd then it tells me I do not have\nsufficient privileges to delete human\n\n88\n00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:42.734\nresources.\n\n89\n00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:45.320\nSo I start scratching my\nhead here a little bit.\n\n90\n00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.284\nAnd it's kind of a process the way that\nthey have you go through additional steps\n\n91\n00:04:50.284 --> 00:04:54.600\nto even be able to uncheck that little\ntick box that I just showed you.\n\n92\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.315\nSo what you would need\nto do is select View.\n\n93\n00:04:58.315 --> 00:05:02.348\nAnd there's this option here, let me\nzoom in so you can really see this, and\n\n94\n00:05:02.348 --> 00:05:04.945\nthis magnifier's getting\nright in my way here.\n\n95\n00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:11.208\nIt's called,\nopen of course my Action menu.\n\n96\n00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:14.542\nAdvanced Features right here,\nthis is what you would need to select.\n\n97\n00:05:14.542 --> 00:05:18.647\nSo by selecting Advanced Features,\nit gives me more information and\n\n98\n00:05:18.647 --> 00:05:23.121\nI'm really able to now see additional\noptions that I didn't have before.\n\n99\n00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:29.114\nSo if I right click Human Resources and\nselect Properties, I have a few extra tabs\n\n100\n00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:34.768\nby selecting that additional parameter\nthere under my View drop down menu.\n\n101\n00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:39.606\nSo under this particular tab,\nit's the Object tab.\n\n102\n00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:45.459\nThis is where you see that little check\nmark, box, I can't even talk right now.\n\n103\n00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:46.038\nYeah, box?\n\n104\n00:05:46.038 --> 00:05:48.577\nIt is clear, I'm like starving,\nand my brain is withering away.\n\n105\n00:05:48.577 --> 00:05:50.808\nBut no,\nthis is where you would change that.\n\n106\n00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:53.502\nI really don't wanna delete it, but\nI just wanted to show you that,\n\n107\n00:05:53.502 --> 00:05:54.744\nsince we were already in here.\n\n108\n00:05:54.744 --> 00:05:58.465\nWe do have an entire Active Directory\nsection coming up so\n\n109\n00:05:58.465 --> 00:06:00.258\nwe won't get too in depth.\n\n110\n00:06:00.258 --> 00:06:05.058\nI know I'm going off on a tangent but,\n[LAUGH] the main thing I wanted to show\n\n111\n00:06:05.058 --> 00:06:08.170\nyou, it's so\neasy how to delegate right here.\n\n112\n00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.507\nIs to right-click and\nselect Delegate Control, and\n\n113\n00:06:11.507 --> 00:06:14.781\nit brings up a little\nDelegation of Control Wizard.\n\n114\n00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.482\nWe'll just hit Next to start this process.\n\n115\n00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:21.459\nAnd I can add an individual user,\nI could add Ronnie.\n\n116\n00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:24.086\nHonestly, I don't think I've added\nhim into Active Directory, but\n\n117\n00:06:24.086 --> 00:06:25.164\nthat's not a big deal here.\n\n118\n00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:29.255\nMaybe I had a group, and\nmy group was IT Staff or Help Desk, and\n\n119\n00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:32.564\nI was allowing them to\nperform certain changes and\n\n120\n00:06:32.564 --> 00:06:36.530\nmodifications to this OU,\nthat would be just as fine here.\n\n121\n00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.320\nI can add my user or group, so we hit this\nAdd button and I'm just gonna be adding,\n\n122\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.242\nyou know what?\n\n123\n00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:43.998\nI think I put Zach in here.\n\n124\n00:06:43.998 --> 00:06:48.456\nLet me see if Zach is\nin my Active Directory.\n\n125\n00:06:48.456 --> 00:06:49.438\nNothing came up here.\n\n126\n00:06:49.438 --> 00:06:50.402\nLet me hit Cancel here.\n\n127\n00:06:50.402 --> 00:06:54.170\nLet's just go with something that I\nknow and the administrative group so\n\n128\n00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.161\nlet's type in Admin and Check Names.\n\n129\n00:06:56.161 --> 00:07:00.102\nAnd we'll select our Administrator and\njust hit OK.\n\n130\n00:07:00.102 --> 00:07:04.597\nSo we'll allow the administrator to\nmodify this OU, not Ronnie, sorry Ronnie.\n\n131\n00:07:04.597 --> 00:07:07.328\nWe will hit OK.\n\n132\n00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:11.669\nAnd, Next, now this is kinda cool.\n\n133\n00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:16.217\nYou have some pre-configured options that\nMicrosoft has provided us in this wizard.\n\n134\n00:07:16.217 --> 00:07:20.557\nSo maybe I want someone to be able to\ncreate, delete and manage groups and\n\n135\n00:07:20.557 --> 00:07:23.134\nto be able to modify the group membership.\n\n136\n00:07:23.134 --> 00:07:26.631\nBut I don't want them performing any\nother functions and deleting policies.\n\n137\n00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:30.760\nIf I'm using group policy to\nmanage this organizational unit.\n\n138\n00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.959\nI could also create a custom task\nto delegate, but I think for\n\n139\n00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.171\nnow this is good and we'll just hit Next.\n\n140\n00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:39.838\nNow before you hit Next there, when you\nstart to take a look at some of these\n\n141\n00:07:39.838 --> 00:07:42.279\noptions especially something like HR,\nright?\n\n142\n00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.512\nSo always think about scenarios\nhere when it comes down to it.\n\n143\n00:07:44.512 --> 00:07:45.024\nGood point.\n\n144\n00:07:45.024 --> 00:07:47.394\nBut the key is,\nif you scroll up to the top of that,\n\n145\n00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:51.466\nthere's one feature that we definitely\ndon't wanna omit which is that one, right?\n\n146\n00:07:51.466 --> 00:07:52.892\nDelete, or no, what is it?\n\n147\n00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:56.180\nCreate, Delete and Manage User Accounts.\n\n148\n00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.954\nSometimes you actually\nsee that one as well.\n\n149\n00:07:58.954 --> 00:08:00.615\nSo I know it's kind of unusual,\n\n150\n00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:04.320\nbut it's one of these things where\neven though there's a list of them.\n\n151\n00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.211\nRemember that what you might end up\nseeing at some point is here's what I\n\n152\n00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:12.797\nneed to do is I need to make\nsure that Zac or Cherokee,\n\n153\n00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:16.240\nthat she can manage IT\ndepartment user accounts.\n\n154\n00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.140\nShe has to be able to create them,\ndelete them, etc.\n\n155\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.860\nWell, you've gotta actually know\nwhat they're looking for here.\n\n156\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.056\nSo it might not list it\nexactly in the name,\n\n157\n00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:27.420\nbut kind of just like she needs to\nbe able to manage user accounts.\n\n158\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.684\nWell, you've got to kind of know which\none of these features that's gonna be and\n\n159\n00:08:31.684 --> 00:08:35.256\nthat's kind of a good example for\nus to kind of be able to center in and\n\n160\n00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:38.970\nrealize we may need to actually check\none of them or multiple of them.\n\n161\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.642\nBut that's a good one for us to remember.\n\n162\n00:08:40.642 --> 00:08:43.490\nYou know Ryan, that actually\nreminds me of something else.\n\n163\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.574\nIf you're thinking about it from that\nexam perspective, let's think about it.\n\n164\n00:08:46.574 --> 00:08:52.770\nWe normally have two majority groups\nthat are performing administration.\n\n165\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.138\nSo that scenario that I had given\nyou like when the remote office,\n\n166\n00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:56.225\nyou have to think about that.\n\n167\n00:08:56.225 --> 00:08:59.031\nHow are you accessing\nthose computers remotely?\n\n168\n00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:00.404\nAre you using RDP?\n\n169\n00:09:00.404 --> 00:09:05.166\nIf so, then you'll need to add the\nindividual user to the remote desktop user\n\n170\n00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:06.190\ngroup.\n\n171\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.530\nAnd if you're gonna allow\nadministrators like the example I had,\n\n172\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.923\nan administrator to\nperform this delegation.\n\n173\n00:09:11.923 --> 00:09:13.972\nYou really need to think about that,\n\n174\n00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:18.970\nbecause do I want to randomly be doling\nout administrative rights to individuals.\n\n175\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.027\nMaybe that's more rights usage\nthan I'd like for them to have and\n\n176\n00:09:23.027 --> 00:09:25.770\nI just want them to be\ngiven the delegation.\n\n177\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.134\nSo from an exam perspective\nallowing someone to\n\n178\n00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:34.716\nputting them in that remote\nusers group is a less,\n\n179\n00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:38.750\nwhat's the word I'm looking for here?\n\n180\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.619\nNot necessarily invasive, but\nthey have less administrative rights.\n\n181\n00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:45.312\nSo it's not as unsecure as giving out or\n\n182\n00:09:45.312 --> 00:09:49.068\nadding individuals to\nthe administrator's group and\n\n183\n00:09:49.068 --> 00:09:55.038\nthat's something you may wanna think about\nbefore getting into exam booth, as well.\n\n184\n00:09:55.038 --> 00:09:56.557\nThis really it for the Wizard.\n\n185\n00:09:56.557 --> 00:09:57.735\nIt's pretty simple.\n\n186\n00:09:57.735 --> 00:10:00.507\nWe just finish this walk through and\nhit Finish and\n\n187\n00:10:00.507 --> 00:10:04.005\nthat's all I wanted to share to\nyou an Active Directory today,\n\n188\n00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:07.440\nbecause it was specifically\ncalled out on those objectives.\n\n189\n00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.869\nThe other thing that was called out,\nthe last configuration item here and\n\n190\n00:10:11.869 --> 00:10:14.450\nI really don't even need server manager.\n\n191\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.883\nThere are a couple different ways\nto access our services here, but\n\n192\n00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:19.488\nmy favorite is really simple.\n\n193\n00:10:19.488 --> 00:10:26.194\nYou just right-click and hit that run\nline and then type in services.msc,\n\n194\n00:10:26.194 --> 00:10:31.667\nand hit Enter, and\nthis will bring up our services snap-in.\n\n195\n00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:33.930\nNow, what's a service?\n\n196\n00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.671\nWell, a service is going to be an\napplication running in the background that\n\n197\n00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:39.950\nour operating system\nusually is going to be and\n\n198\n00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.950\nthat application's maybe relying on.\n\n199\n00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:48.720\nAnd a lot of times, it's not anything\nthat we're invoking or initializing.\n\n200\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.310\nWe just power up our machine and they\nstart running there in the background.\n\n201\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:57.700\nSo, they're designed to keep our\noperating systems stable and functioning.\n\n202\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:04.600\nHowever, from a server side, there may\nbe times where you need to modify them.\n\n203\n00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.616\nBecause if we think about client side,\nI have a problem with my computer.\n\n204\n00:11:08.616 --> 00:11:11.950\nWhat's the number one easiest thing to do?\n\n205\n00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.341\nWell, hit the reboot button.\n\n206\n00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:13.961\nMaybe and\n\n207\n00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:19.006\nhopefully it will solve that transient\nissue that end user is experiencing.\n\n208\n00:11:19.006 --> 00:11:21.760\nWell, can we do that with our servers?\n\n209\n00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.490\nMaybe, but how many people\nis it going to be affecting?\n\n210\n00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.630\nAre we gonna be having any downtime?\n\n211\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.860\nHow much money are we gonna be losing?\n\n212\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:33.319\nSo, those are all things you need\nto think about and granularly\n\n213\n00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:39.610\nstopping a service is a lot easier\nthan bring the entire server offline.\n\n214\n00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.574\nSo, that's why it's important to\nunderstand what services are and\n\n215\n00:11:43.574 --> 00:11:45.086\nwhere we can manage them.\n\n216\n00:11:45.086 --> 00:11:47.367\nSo within the graphical user interface,\n\n217\n00:11:47.367 --> 00:11:50.170\nthe services console is\nwhere you would do that.\n\n218\n00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.647\nSo if we take a look at that again, I\njust wanna pick one and I know Ronnie and\n\n219\n00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:56.540\nI pick on this one particular.\n\n220\n00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.770\nLet's see the spooler process a lot.\n\n221\n00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:03.567\nThere you can see there are all sorts of\ndifferent processes that are running here.\n\n222\n00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:06.680\nThat one is just easy to play with.\n\n223\n00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:12.350\nIt's not going to ruin a system,\nif I stop and restart it and- Go back up.\n\n224\n00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.450\nYou've passed it.\nDid I pass it?\n\n225\n00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.843\nYep, it's prints puller.\n\n226\n00:12:14.843 --> 00:12:21.966\nSo, I'll show you why I thought it\nwas just spooler here in my mind.\n\n227\n00:12:21.966 --> 00:12:24.664\nIf I right-click on this and\nfirst of all before I do that,\n\n228\n00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:26.491\nI wanna show you our columns over here.\n\n229\n00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:31.660\nSo if I click on this,\nI can see the description.\n\n230\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:36.670\nWell, if I were to pull this out,\nit's going to be servicing\n\n231\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.110\nmy printer spool my job there and\nlet's see handles.\n\n232\n00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.810\nHoly cow,\nthey've got a big description there.\n\n233\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.597\nBut that's cool.\nThat's good for\n\n234\n00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.150\nyou to have all that information.\n\n235\n00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.451\nIt's over there on the left hand side\nright below There you go Ronnie.\n\n236\n00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:53.480\n[LAUGH] Pointing out the obvious.\n\n237\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.485\nThank you for that.\n\n238\n00:12:54.485 --> 00:12:58.660\nI need that today, but\nwe can also see our status here.\n\n239\n00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.267\nWe know that, that print service is\nrunning and I can't even tell you how many\n\n240\n00:13:02.267 --> 00:13:05.501\ntimes I've had to go in work\nenvironments and stop and restart this.\n\n241\n00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:08.673\nBecause printers are just\nkind of crazy at times and\n\n242\n00:13:08.673 --> 00:13:12.010\nsometimes they really will\njust resolve that issue.\n\n243\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.279\nSo if I right-click here,\nI can select stop.\n\n244\n00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:23.470\nAnd you'll notice that a couple of options\nthat I have like start, pause, resume.\n\n245\n00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.048\nThose are great outs.\nSo really, if I wanted to stop it,\n\n246\n00:13:26.048 --> 00:13:27.580\nI can select stop here.\n\n247\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.300\nAnd then my start would be\nif I were to click again,\n\n248\n00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.440\nthat is available to me now, so\nI could go ahead and restart that.\n\n249\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.941\nBefore I do that though,\n\n250\n00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:44.310\nlet's select properties to look at\nsome additional information here.\n\n251\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.481\nThe reason I was scrolling down and\nlooking through S and\n\n252\n00:13:47.481 --> 00:13:51.937\nI thought it was just spooler is if you're\nworking within PowerShell like I had\n\n253\n00:13:51.937 --> 00:13:56.866\nmention before to you guys, it's important\nto pay attention to the different types of\n\n254\n00:13:56.866 --> 00:13:59.459\nnames that the operating\nsystem uses again.\n\n255\n00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:02.380\nSo, the display name is Print Spooler.\n\n256\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.556\nHowever, the service name,\nwhen the servicing it and using it within\n\n257\n00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:10.140\nPowerShell, they're just gonna abbreviate\nit slightly and call its spooler.\n\n258\n00:14:12.302 --> 00:14:15.104\nBut there's some cool\noptions that we have here,\n\n259\n00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:18.314\nlet's just cover some of those and\ntalk about them here.\n\n260\n00:14:18.314 --> 00:14:22.470\nSo the startup type being automatic,\nso we have automatic.\n\n261\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.280\nMeaning, whenever the system powers on,\nit's automatically gonna be started.\n\n262\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.290\nThere's an option here for\nan automatic delayed start.\n\n263\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:35.770\nSo if this is not an essential service\nthat I need from the onset and maybe I'm\n\n264\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.670\nworried about system bombardment of all\nthese services starting at the same time,\n\n265\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:45.780\nI may stagger them in the starting process\njust to help with the boot process there.\n\n266\n00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.382\nManual means it's going to be\nrequiring a manual- Trigger.\n\n267\n00:14:51.382 --> 00:14:55.217\nYeah, you have to go ahead and\nspecify whether it would be a script or\n\n268\n00:14:55.217 --> 00:14:58.130\nsomething or just manually and\ndisabled meaning.\n\n269\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.120\nWell, it's disabled there.\n\n270\n00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.281\nHere are some start parameters.\n\n271\n00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:07.613\nSo you might want,\nif you were using that manual option and\n\n272\n00:15:07.613 --> 00:15:09.740\nadd some parameters there.\n\n273\n00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.254\nWhat other things do we have here?\n\n274\n00:15:12.254 --> 00:15:13.000\nLog on.\n\n275\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.260\nSo, your Microsoft has generously\ncreated service accounts for us.\n\n276\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.171\nService accounts weren't always around,\nbut they really were created\n\n277\n00:15:23.171 --> 00:15:28.100\nto handle background operating\nsystem function such as services.\n\n278\n00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.609\nSo you do have the ability to specify\na particular accounts, but I wouldn't be\n\n279\n00:15:32.609 --> 00:15:37.053\nsurprised if somehow there's a lot to\nthink about when you're talking about\n\n280\n00:15:37.053 --> 00:15:41.932\nservices and although there might be some\ndependencies running in the background.\n\n281\n00:15:41.932 --> 00:15:46.048\nSo, it's kinda just best\npractice to leave that alone and\n\n282\n00:15:46.048 --> 00:15:50.672\nnot specify additional accounts\nto be managing these services.\n\n283\n00:15:50.672 --> 00:15:53.676\nNow I mentioned our print spooler here,\n\n284\n00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:57.395\nbecause I said sometimes\nit will relieve issues.\n\n285\n00:15:57.395 --> 00:16:00.683\nBut maybe you've been to\nthis particular printer Or\n\n286\n00:16:00.683 --> 00:16:04.495\nactivated this interface here\nfive times in the last week and\n\n287\n00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:08.510\nit's getting a little out of hand,\na little ridiculous.\n\n288\n00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:13.260\nSo, you do have the option to\nspecify how the operating system\n\n289\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:18.250\nshould react if this service were\nrandomly experiencing stops.\n\n290\n00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.420\nSo, if the first failure were to happen\nyou could say hey let's go ahead restart\n\n291\n00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.040\nthis service, but\nthe second failure, okay,\n\n292\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.210\nmaybe you know everyone has\nsome issues sometimes, right?\n\n293\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.440\nHowever, if subsequent\nfailures where happening,\n\n294\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.600\nmaybe there would be additional actions\nthat I would wanna go ahead and\n\n295\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.570\ntake like hey, let's go ahead and restart\nthe computer or something to that nature.\n\n296\n00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:44.210\nSo just knowing there are options in here\nwhen you're working with the GUI for\n\n297\n00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.530\nour services.\n\n298\n00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.460\nAnd I've mentioned dependencies on this,\nthe last tab here.\n\n299\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.510\nSo dependencies are going to\nbe additional service, or\n\n300\n00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:59.890\nAPIs, or DLLs that are dependent\non a particular service.\n\n301\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.060\nAnd you might want to take\na look at that because for\n\n302\n00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.030\nour spooler service here we\ndo have some dependencies and\n\n303\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.950\nit's just good to be aware of them,\nthose dependencies, so that if you do stop\n\n304\n00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.940\nit you're not breaking something\nwhile you're trying to fix one thing.\n\n305\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.220\nSo I think that's about it that I wanted\nto show you here in the interface.\n\n306\n00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.800\nBut just like with a lot of\nother things we've seen so\n\n307\n00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.030\nfar, there's another way\nto manage our services.\n\n308\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.320\nAnd that way is going\nto be via PowerShell.\n\n309\n00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.030\nSo the first command we wanna type\nis Get-Service, and we'll hit Enter.\n\n310\n00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.440\nSo this is essentially what we were seeing\nfrom the graphical user interface, but\n\n311\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.050\njust in our command line interface.\n\n312\n00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.200\nAnd we can also see the statuses\nnoted here on the left-hand side.\n\n313\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.200\nI didn't mean to move all that around,\nbut you can see if it's running or\n\n314\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.930\nstopped, and\nthen let me just kinda move this around,\n\n315\n00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.160\nso we can go back to the top so\nyou guys can see these columns.\n\n316\n00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.363\nAnd this is going to be, that center\ncolumn is the name and then the far right\n\n317\n00:18:03.363 --> 00:18:07.532\nhand column is going to be the display\nname that I was referencing before.\n\n318\n00:18:07.532 --> 00:18:11.307\nBut it's a little difficult\nto look at everything here,\n\n319\n00:18:11.307 --> 00:18:13.597\nI'm just gonna clear the screen.\n\n320\n00:18:13.597 --> 00:18:19.200\nAnd if I wanted to maybe filter\nthis out into an easier to read and\n\n321\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.854\nfiltered format,\nI can type Get-Service space and\n\n322\n00:18:23.854 --> 00:18:27.900\nthen pipe that into\nperhaps my out GridView.\n\n323\n00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:33.610\nSo that's just gonna be out-Gridview,\nand hit enter.\n\n324\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.590\nSo it gives me a bit of a GUI\nhere to manipulate things.\n\n325\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.120\nSo, for instance, if I wanted to\nhit this little button here for\n\n326\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.480\nadd criteria, I could select the status,\nand then hit add.\n\n327\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.040\nSo if I wanted to search for\nall of my running services,\n\n328\n00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.680\nI could type that in and hit enter.\n\n329\n00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.999\nContains running, hold on.\n\n330\n00:18:59.927 --> 00:19:02.670\nEnd status contains running.\n\n331\n00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.860\nLet me just change that here.\n\n332\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.330\nHow about let's do name?\n\n333\n00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.200\nAnd maybe I don't remember\nthe name of a particular service,\n\n334\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.860\nand I wanted to type in print, and I don't\nknow if it was print or print spooler.\n\n335\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.380\nGuys, I am so sorry,\nI'm like why is this not working?\n\n336\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.830\nI'm typing in the wrong field here,\nso let me just type in right here and\n\n337\n00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.190\nthat's where you need to\ntype is in this top line.\n\n338\n00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:30.330\nBut this is where you'd see how\nto filter by certain perimeters.\n\n339\n00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.050\nYou're somewhat limited here withing\nPowerShell you have more flexibility and\n\n340\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.590\nI'll show you another way\nthat you can filter as well.\n\n341\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.600\nBut really, there are just so\nmany different options and\n\n342\n00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.620\nways that you can really\nmanipulate here within PowerShell.\n\n343\n00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.470\nSo let me just close out of here,\nand let's clear the screen, and\n\n344\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.170\nwe'll take a look at a couple of other\nthings I wanted to show you here.\n\n345\n00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.760\nHow are we going to stop and\nstart the service?\n\n346\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.389\nSo if I remember correctly,\nwe stopped that spooler service,\n\n347\n00:19:58.389 --> 00:20:01.274\nthe print spooler service,\nfrom within the GUI.\n\n348\n00:20:01.274 --> 00:20:07.275\nSo let's just type in Get_Service and\nif we wanna check on a particular\n\n349\n00:20:07.275 --> 00:20:12.275\nservice to see how it's doing\nwhat the stats say whatever,\n\n350\n00:20:12.275 --> 00:20:16.488\nwe can type Get_Service and\nthen type in -name.\n\n351\n00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:19.676\nAnd the name there,\nremember it wasn't principled spooler,\n\n352\n00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:24.400\nthe service name was actually just poor,\nso we'll type in spooler, hit enter.\n\n353\n00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.370\nAnd yes, so\nthe status was actually stopped.\n\n354\n00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.850\nSo now someone is calling me saying,\n\n355\n00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.070\nhey I can't print to this particular\nprinter, what's the issue?\n\n356\n00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.343\nWell we need to start that service,\nmaybe I forgot to turn it back on.\n\n357\n00:20:37.343 --> 00:20:44.072\nSo here we'll just type in start-service,\nand again, I will specify the name,\n\n358\n00:20:44.072 --> 00:20:49.745\nand that is going to be spooler,\nand we'll hit spooler, hit enter.\n\n359\n00:20:49.745 --> 00:20:54.921\nAnd I don't have any kind of obvious\nindication that it has been started again,\n\n360\n00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:59.785\nso I'll just hit my up arrow and get that\nservice again to verify that it is in\n\n361\n00:20:59.785 --> 00:21:02.360\nfact running, I can check that there.\n\n362\n00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.480\nSo, that's something that we can do\nhere in PowerShell and what else.\n\n363\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.130\nI also wanna show you how I could\nfilter here in PowerShell like I said.\n\n364\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.225\nSo, if I again type in Get-Service,\n\n365\n00:21:15.225 --> 00:21:19.440\njust Get-Service, and\nwe need to pipe this out.\n\n366\n00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:25.880\nSo here I can set some parameters,\nwhere-object,\n\n367\n00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.010\nso where the object, space,\nI'll need a curly bracket for\n\n368\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:35.050\nthis one, so\nwhere the object is going to be, so\n\n369\n00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.550\nwe'll do not S, dollar sign,\nunderscore, period.\n\n370\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:42.289\nSo I'm saying where the status,\nso where status\n\n371\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.130\nspace -eq, so that just means\nwhere the status is equal to.\n\n372\n00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.640\nAnd then I'll put that status,\nand so maybe I wanna check and\n\n373\n00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.440\nlook for everything that has\nbeen stopped here in quotation.\n\n374\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.590\nI will have to close that\ncurly bracket and hit enter.\n\n375\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:04.810\nAnd at this point, the system will\nrender me all of the information for\n\n376\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.355\nthose stopped services there.\n\n377\n00:22:07.355 --> 00:22:13.631\nSo, the skies the limit here when you're\nusing PowerShell to apply filters.\n\n378\n00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:15.476\nMost commonly, you might want to check.\n\n379\n00:22:15.476 --> 00:22:18.057\nLet me clear this real quick,\ncuz it's hard to look at.\n\n380\n00:22:18.057 --> 00:22:22.072\nBut if I hit my up arrow again,\nI could even go back and\n\n381\n00:22:22.072 --> 00:22:26.560\njust make it real easy for us,\nchange stopped to running.\n\n382\n00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.380\nMaybe that's the type of service that\nI have in question, I wanna see hey,\n\n383\n00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.090\nwhat's running on this system,\nor what's not running?\n\n384\n00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.570\nSo there's a lot of different things\nthat we could think about here, but\n\n385\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.150\nI think that's a good place.\n\n386\n00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.550\nI know we've been talking about\nconfiguration options for\n\n387\n00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.380\na long time now, but that's it for\nthis particular objective.\n\n388\n00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.190\nMoving forward, we'll be looking\nat more of those management and\n\n389\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.210\nmaintenance type functions.\n\n390\n00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.656\nBut that's it for now Ronnie.\n\n391\n00:22:52.656 --> 00:22:54.600\nAll right Cherokee,\nwell thank you again for\n\n392\n00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.170\nhelping us out here and\nunderstanding a little bit more\n\n393\n00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:01.140\nabout delegating administrative types of\nthings that we have to be able to do.\n\n394\n00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.410\nSo Cherokee showed us that inside\nof course of the Active Directory\n\n395\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.520\nstructure that we saw.\n\n396\n00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.510\nAnd also of course being able to configure\nand manipulate some of these services.\n\n397\n00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:15.642\nUnderstanding these are actually a big\npart of helping others to ensure that they\n\n398\n00:23:15.642 --> 00:23:20.708\nget what they need to during the regular\nnetwork functions that need to happen.\n\n399\n00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:23.082\nBut that's also a great place for\nus to sign off.\n\n400\n00:23:23.082 --> 00:23:25.989\nFor ITPRO.TV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n401\n00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:27.055\nAnd I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n402\n00:23:27.055 --> 00:23:32.505\nStay tuned right here for\nmore the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n403\n00:23:32.505 -->

00:00:12.310\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.160\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another right here on\nITProTV you're watching the MCSA for\n\n5\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990\nWindows Server 2012 show specially for\nexam 70-410.\n\n6\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.570\nI'm your host,\n\n7\n00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.530\nRonnie Wong and we're gonna be taking\na look at configuring disks today.\n\n8\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.630\nAnd here to help us to\nunderstand what we need to know,\n\n9\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.380\nespecially in getting ready for\nthe exam is gonna be Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.620\nCherokee, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Hi Ronnie, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.170\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.800\nAs we begin, as we take a look\nhere about working hard drives, or\n\n14\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.220\ndiscs, let's put it that way instead.\n\n15\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.740\nAnd that is because a lot of people\nthat are now beginning their MCSA track.\n\n16\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.600\nAs they start to look and\ngo hey I wanna get this.\n\n17\n00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.750\nMost of them may actually been\nworking on just desktop systems.\n\n18\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.420\nAnd they've really only been working with\nwhat they have on their own machines.\n\n19\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.150\nSo Cherokee, what do we need to know as we\nstart to move into the realm of server and\n\n20\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.900\nthe idea here of configuring disks?\n\n21\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay Ronnie, great question\nbecause according to Microsoft,\n\n22\n00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.670\nthere are some specific objectives that\nwe're gonna actually covered here.\n\n23\n00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.064\nSo when you're talking about, like you\nsaid, if you're familiar with client-side\n\n24\n00:01:14.064 --> 00:01:17.430\noperating systems,\nserver-side storage is quite complex.\n\n25\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.240\nThere's a lot of different layers here.\n\n26\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.530\nSo I'm gonna cover as much as we can but,\nspecifically, I wanna call out,\n\n27\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.070\nwe'll be looking at basic\nversus dynamic disks first.\n\n28\n00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.690\nWe'll also take a look at different\ntypes of partitioning schemas or styles.\n\n29\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.140\nSpecifically MBR and GPT,\n\n30\n00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.110\nwe'll also look at how virtual hard\ndisc drives fit into that picture.\n\n31\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.310\nAnd if we have time, Ronnie,\nwe'll also look at how to manage volumes.\n\n32\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.650\nWe'll start with the GUI and\nthen work our way into PowerShell,\n\n33\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.040\njust like we have with everything\nelse here, so that's the plan.\n\n34\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\n\n35\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.290\nwhere do we need to get started as we move\ninto server and as we start taking a look.\n\n36\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.030\nBecause a lot of times,\n\n37\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.970\none of the scariest things that I\nremember, when I first got into it,\n\n38\n00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.740\nwas I realized that had to deal\nwith more than one particular disk.\n\n39\n00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.720\nAnd then the terminology was also\na little bit challenging too.\n\n40\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.080\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nthe terminology is a little overwhelming.\n\n41\n00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.500\nI don't want you guys\nto get hung up on that.\n\n42\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.140\nRonnie we did some shows for server 101\nbefore and we kind of broke it down really\n\n43\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.970\nin that way but if you guys want you\ncan go back in and check those out.\n\n44\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.140\nThere's some intro into\ndisk management as well,\n\n45\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.270\nwill try my best to call out\nwhat we really need to know.\n\n46\n00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.610\nSo I think starting with\nthe terminology for\n\n47\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.600\ndisks, like I said we'll be talking\nabout virtual disks and physical disks.\n\n48\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.160\nAnd it's kind of a moot point when\nwe're talking server side storage\n\n49\n00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160\nbecause nowadays it's so\ncommon to have virtualized disks, and\n\n50\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.850\nwhat I think Microsoft wants to\nconvey in this particular section of\n\n51\n00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.650\nobjectives is to really understand\nthat the management side of\n\n52\n00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.220\nthings is gonna be the same, the way that\nwe handle and treat those disks once\n\n53\n00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.210\nrecognized by that operating system, we're\ngonna go ahead and treat them the same.\n\n54\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.340\nRegardless if it's physical, or\nif it's going to be virtualized.\n\n55\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.320\nWhen we get to Hyper-V section,\n\n56\n00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.270\nthere will be additional\ninformation called out there.\n\n57\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.880\nThat we'll look at to explore\nvirtual discs a little further.\n\n58\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.030\nSo, I think the best place to start here\nwould be looking at the difference between\n\n59\n00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.930\nbasic and dynamic disks, so what is that?\n\n60\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.520\nIf we take a look at my screen,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.380\ncover some of these high points here.\n\n62\n00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.430\nA basic disk is just that,\nlike it sounds, it's pretty basic.\n\n63\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.240\nThere's not a whole lot\nyou can do with it.\n\n64\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.350\nYou can create partitions and volumes that\nare configured, they're really confined\n\n65\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.560\nto a single disk, so whether that\ndisk be physical or virtualized,\n\n66\n00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.280\nyou can't take those partitions and\ncreate, you know, a spanned volumes.\n\n67\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.490\nThat would go ahead and be a dynamic disk,\nand we'll take a look at that and\n\n68\n00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.190\nkind of compare and contrast the two\nthere, even setting them up.\n\n69\n00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.340\nI think that's where you'll get the most\nbenefit from this, is actually getting in\n\n70\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.570\nthe operating system and seeing how it\nreacts, and handles these different disks.\n\n71\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.450\nNow why would someone want to\nuse a disk that is so basic?\n\n72\n00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.290\nWell basic disks allow for\noperating systems to boot from them,\n\n73\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.900\nso there's also a lot of backwards\ncompatibility with that as well now,\n\n74\n00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.000\nthere is several limitations here.\n\n75\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.730\nOne of the most notorious limitations\nwould be the amount of partitions\n\n76\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.370\nthat you can have, so\n\n77\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.310\nyou can have up to four partitions,\nthree primary and one extended.\n\n78\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.600\nNow there are some workarounds\nwhere you can create logical\n\n79\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.700\ndrives to create additional storage\nspaces, so units of storage with those\n\n80\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.220\nextended partitions but\nif that's really your cup of tea and you\n\n81\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.020\nwant to have multiple volumes then dynamic\ndisks is going to be the way to go.\n\n82\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.920\nAs a matter of fact dynamic\ndisks is even phasing out and\n\n83\n00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.050\nwe'll take a look at that as well.\n\n84\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.660\nSo Basic Disks do not provide any kind of\nintegrated software resistance to damage.\n\n85\n00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.410\nWe do have utilities that have been around\nfor a very long time like chkdsk, fdisk,\n\n86\n00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.775\nfix disk and we will need to use those\ntypes of utilities to manage and\n\n87\n00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:15.085\nmaintain the health of these disks.\n\n88\n00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:19.345\nAnd it also allows us to boot various\nsystems from various partitions.\n\n89\n00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:20.860\nWe could have multi boot.\n\n90\n00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.230\nNow when we take a look at dynamic discs,\nif you're ever in a, you know,\n\n91\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.870\na conundrum and\nyou're not sure which one to choose.\n\n92\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.030\nIf you for\nsure want to have that disk be bootable,\n\n93\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.830\ndynamic discs cannot boot\nin every configuration.\n\n94\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.060\nSo this is a safe bet here.\n\n95\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.680\nSo it's probably one of the reasons why,\nand of course for\n\n96\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.950\nthat backwards compatibility, it's pretty\ncommon to still utilize basic disks here,\n\n97\n00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.140\nso when we're talking about functionality,\nwe're somewhat limited here.\n\n98\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.440\nWe can perform some basic functions\nsuch as create and delete primary and\n\n99\n00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.150\nextended partitions.\n\n100\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.460\nYou can create and delete logical\ndrives within an extended partition.\n\n101\n00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.930\nAnd you can format and mark it as active.\n\n102\n00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.030\nThe good news is, look, we're not married\nto this concept, if I wanted to later\n\n103\n00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.160\non decide I wanted to convert to a dynamic\ndisk I do have that capability as well.\n\n104\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.200\nThere is a caveat to that,\nbecause the way,\n\n105\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.680\nactually let's just start\ntalking about Dynamic Disks.\n\n106\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.220\nBut because the way that dynamic disks\nadd additional integrated checksums and\n\n107\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.790\nit maintains and stores information\nabout disks, you will need at least one\n\n108\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.830\nmegabyte worth of free space on that\ndisk before you convert it to dynamic.\n\n109\n00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.440\nSo that's the only thing\nto keep in mind there.\n\n110\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.960\nBut I mean it's so\nsmall by today's standards,\n\n111\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.700\nit shouldn't be an issue for you.\n\n112\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.750\nWhen we look at dynamic disks,\nthe main reason why someone would want\n\n113\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.460\nto use one is because it really\ndoes expand the functionality and\n\n114\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.770\nallows us to utilize multiple disks.\n\n115\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.160\nAnd when we start talking about\nvolumes and how we can manage them.\n\n116\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.530\nIt's almost as if we're, well, it is.\n\n117\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.790\nIt's like we're implementing\nsoftware-based RAID configurations.\n\n118\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.640\nIf you don't know what\nRAID configurations are,\n\n119\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.890\nit is implied that you do have that prior\nknowledge at this point in the game.\n\n120\n00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.890\nSo, if not, the good news is,\nRyan and I we did that in Server 101.\n\n121\n00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.490\nThere are plenty of shows in our course\nlibrary that explain rate configurations.\n\n122\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.360\nAnd we'll look at the volume\nside of things, but\n\n123\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.930\nwe're not gonna cover\nthose actual configs here.\n\n124\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.180\nSo, now another thing is\nthat it can be composed of\n\n125\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.610\na set of noncontinuous spaces or\nmultiple physical disks.\n\n126\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.600\nSo I can take that concept of RAID and\nI can\n\n127\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.570\nbring these drives together either for\npanned with aggregation.\n\n128\n00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.760\nI can do it for speed improvements.\n\n129\n00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.410\nSo whether fault tolerance and, or really\nif you can utilize it for both of those.\n\n130\n00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.540\nSo it really is just gonna be dependent\non how you wanna configure those disks.\n\n131\n00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:58.735\nNow, Dynamic Disks do have integrated\ndamage resistance which is pretty cool.\n\n132\n00:07:58.735 --> 00:08:01.874\nAnd actually these two\nbullet points kind of go\n\n133\n00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:06.796\ntogether here because the database\nprovides management flexibility.\n\n134\n00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:10.140\nWhat that means with that\nmanagement flexibility,\n\n135\n00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.500\nthere's a database that is stored.\n\n136\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:18.110\nSo if you look at the way that\ndynamic disks are really broken down,\n\n137\n00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.440\nand Microsoft, I'll show you in a moment\nhere, they really have a good job of\n\n138\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.022\nbreaking that down for\nyou if you don't know how that works.\n\n139\n00:08:24.022 --> 00:08:28.740\nBut there's an actual database that's\nstored within dynamic discs and it\n\n140\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.580\ncontains information about that disc, and\nabout other dynamic discs in that system.\n\n141\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.074\nSo if there's any kind of fault, it will\nautomatically try, especially if you have\n\n142\n00:08:38.074 --> 00:08:41.873\nany kind of special configuration,\nlike a mirrored volume set up, and\n\n143\n00:08:41.873 --> 00:08:44.815\nit will automatically try to\nrepair that disc for you.\n\n144\n00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:48.215\nSo that's one of the main reasons\nwhy someone would want to use them,\n\n145\n00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:51.380\nis to take advantage of\nthose functions there.\n\n146\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.850\nNow, I did say that dynamic disks\nwere kinda on their way out.\n\n147\n00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.400\nDynamic disks are definitely\nan improvement, they provide more\n\n148\n00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.050\nfunctionality than a basic disk, but\nwith the advent of storage spaces,\n\n149\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:09.590\nMicrosoft is really trying to push that\nfrom server side storage management.\n\n150\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.000\nWe have a lot of really cool new and\nimproved technologies.\n\n151\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.943\nSo, in my opinion, dynamic discs,\nit's not like they're going to be extinct,\n\n152\n00:09:17.943 --> 00:09:22.457\nbut you're really going to start\nutilizing storage pools to manage server\n\n153\n00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:23.404\nside storage.\n\n154\n00:09:23.404 --> 00:09:26.335\nAnd that just what we'll focus on\nthat also a little bit later down\n\n155\n00:09:26.335 --> 00:09:27.850\nthe road here.\n\n156\n00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.510\nNow, when we walk about\nthe functionalities that dynamic\n\n157\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.880\ndisks are able to perform,\nwe can create and delete simple spanned,\n\n158\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.640\nstriped, mirrored, and RAID-5 volumes.\n\n159\n00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.030\nWe'll cover those and walk through, in the\nGUI, how you would actually create those.\n\n160\n00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.290\nWe can extend a simple or spanned volume.\n\n161\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.880\nWe can remove a mirror\nfrom a mirrored volume or\n\n162\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.500\nbreak the mirror volume into two volumes.\n\n163\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:58.070\nSo if you about with our mirror RAID,\nthat's what we're really talking about\n\n164\n00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:04.720\nhere, is having disks to have an exact\nduplicate of the data that you're storing.\n\n165\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.815\nYou can also repair mirrored or\nRAID-5 volumes like I said,\n\n166\n00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:11.800\nthat all goes back to that database\nthere and how that disk is managed.\n\n167\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:18.259\nAnd you can also reactivate a missing or\noffline disk.\n\n168\n00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:22.880\nSo the system will be able\nto notice if a disk has some\n\n169\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.541\nkind of health issue, or if it missing.\n\n170\n00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:31.485\nAnd then bring it online, especially\nif you have one sitting there as\n\n171\n00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:35.295\na reserve in standby and\nthen it just uses that disk.\n\n172\n00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:40.240\nTo bring it back rebuild the functionality\nof your configuration, and\n\n173\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.150\nthere's even ways we can automate this\nto make it all happen behind the scenes.\n\n174\n00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.800\nI don't need to be present to do that.\n\n175\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.870\nThe operating system handles if for me.\n\n176\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.510\nSo that's really cool.\n\n177\n00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.830\nI think the big takeaway here.\n\n178\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:11:00.910\nRemember, basic discs, you can only\nhave basic discs on one individual disc.\n\n179\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.725\nSo one sole or one single disc.\n\n180\n00:11:03.725 --> 00:11:05.220\nSo you can't span them.\n\n181\n00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.560\nIf you do, then that bumps it into that\ncategory of a dynamic disc, you have to.\n\n182\n00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.060\nAnd we'll look at how to\nconfigure that in a few moments.\n\n183\n00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.060\nBut Microsoft also has some\ngreat information online.\n\n184\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.830\nI just want to show you the link here.\n\n185\n00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:25.345\nSo they say, basic and dynamic disks, tons\nof information here, all of the TechNet.\n\n186\n00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:28.340\nSo when we talk about,\nwe'll be looking at mirrored volume,\n\n187\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:33.055\nall of these configurations that we\nreference there is literally a page for\n\n188\n00:11:33.055 --> 00:11:34.965\nevery single one of these terms.\n\n189\n00:11:34.965 --> 00:11:39.725\nAnd I'm being a little facetious here but\nabout every single term has documentations\n\n190\n00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:42.555\nso you can really dive in there and\nunderstand it.\n\n191\n00:11:42.555 --> 00:11:46.170\nBut a lot of it also is just\nimplied at this point as well.\n\n192\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.090\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, so when we start to\ntake a look especially at the information\n\n193\n00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.990\nthat we've just been talking about here,\nand\n\n194\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.350\nseeing, we also need to consider this\nwhen we go in for the exam as well.\n\n195\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.960\nDon't always just think that it's about\nlisting the information that's actually\n\n196\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.760\nthere, always try and think of a scenario\nabout when you would choose to use\n\n197\n00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.310\na dynamic disk versus a basic disc.\n\n198\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.120\nWhat are some of those parameters there\nthat you want to make sure that you\n\n199\n00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.050\nthink about?\n\n200\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.680\nAlso, as Cherokee brings us to that\ntime when we actually start taking\n\n201\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.240\na look at the configuration,\nmake sure you pay attention there as well.\n\n202\n00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.200\nBut those are some of the things that\nyou definitely want to make sure that\n\n203\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.940\nyou understand,\nis the choice that you might make,\n\n204\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:31.270\nor what's the benefit of using that\nbasic versus the dynamic or vice versa.\n\n205\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.776\nThese are all good things to consider\nwhen preparing for the exam as well.\n\n206\n00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:37.289\nAll right, Cherokee,\nwhat are we gonna take a look at now?\n\n207\n00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:40.422\n&gt;&gt; You know, why don't we just go ahead\nand hop into my computer here and\n\n208\n00:12:40.422 --> 00:12:43.420\nwe'll take a look at how to\ncreate a basic or dynamic disk?\n\n209\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.676\nSo let me pull up Server Manager here,\n\n210\n00:12:45.676 --> 00:12:50.478\nand I have to remember how many disks I\nactually have in this particular machine.\n\n211\n00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.527\nI'm using practice labs, and so\n\n212\n00:12:52.527 --> 00:12:57.790\nthey have a storage lab for us here, and\nthat's what we'll take a look at now.\n\n213\n00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.276\nThere are a couple different\nways to pull up Disk Management.\n\n214\n00:13:01.276 --> 00:13:06.583\nYou could utilize Server Manager,\nwhich is what they designed it for,\n\n215\n00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:10.460\nunder tools, select Computer Management.\n\n216\n00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.524\nAnd then from Computer Management,\n\n217\n00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:16.200\nyou have Disk Management over\nhere on the left hand side.\n\n218\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.960\nAnother way you could pull that up\nwould be either to right click on the,\n\n219\n00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.410\nit looks like we got disconnected there.\n\n220\n00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.070\nLet's give it a second here,\nand try to reconnect.\n\n221\n00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.884\nSometimes that happens in this\nvirtual environment, but that's okay.\n\n222\n00:13:33.884 --> 00:13:38.817\nSo another way you could look at\nthat would be right clicking on your\n\n223\n00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:44.027\nWindows Start button and\nalternatively you could click, I say that.\n\n224\n00:13:44.027 --> 00:13:47.310\nOkay, so\nhere we have Disk Management noted here.\n\n225\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.970\nAnd then there's another way that\nyou could pull that up as well and\n\n226\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.870\nthat would be utilizing your run line.\n\n227\n00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:57.340\nAnd you would just type in diskmgmt.msc.\n\n228\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.460\nAnd go ahead and hit Enter and\nit would pull it up as well.\n\n229\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.710\nSo there are a couple different\nways that you could access that.\n\n230\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.940\nNow we haven't gotten this far yet\nand I do want to just\n\n231\n00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.570\nnotice that there is a warning\ninitialized disk which is kind of cool.\n\n232\n00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.070\nYou don't always get to see this.\n\n233\n00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.256\nBecause sometimes when\nyou're working with disks,\n\n234\n00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:20.181\nyou're coming into an environment\nthat's already been configured.\n\n235\n00:14:20.181 --> 00:14:24.828\nBut every time you put a new disk into\nthe actual machine, a physical disk.\n\n236\n00:14:24.828 --> 00:14:29.100\nHere you're gonna be getting a prompt\nthat says to initialize the disk.\n\n237\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.900\nWhat does that mean?\n\n238\n00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.490\nWell the operating system has to do a few\nthings before it can even recognize and\n\n239\n00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.780\nallow you to work with that disk.\n\n240\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.420\nYou need to initialize it and\n\n241\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.930\nyou also need to bring it online before we\nperform any of these management functions.\n\n242\n00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:46.700\nSo, here's the thing,\nI'm prompted to configure it now,\n\n243\n00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.550\nI don't have to, I could hit Cancel.\n\n244\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:54.745\nAnd I could do this at a later time\nto initialize it if I didn't want to.\n\n245\n00:14:54.745 --> 00:14:56.949\nSo you really don't get\nto see that too often but\n\n246\n00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:59.670\nthat's pretty cool that\nyou guys saw that there.\n\n247\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:05.010\nNow, the disks that I have\nin this environment already.\n\n248\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:10.090\nSo just like disk 0 here, with computing,\nmost everything starts at 0,\n\n249\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.650\nso that's just another one of our disks.\n\n250\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:17.730\nI have my C drive, so this disk 0 is\nmy bootable operating system drive.\n\n251\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.830\nI have a system reserved partition\nwhich contains boot information or\n\n252\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.930\npair information, any kind of bit\nlocker encryption information\n\n253\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.240\nif I we're utilizing that, so\nwe're not gonna mess with that here.\n\n254\n00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.280\nNow if you looked below\nI have how many disks?\n\n255\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:38.620\nI have disk one, disk two and\ndisk three that are actual disks here.\n\n256\n00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.050\nWe've got a 10 gig disk,\na 15 gig disk, and a 20 gig disk.\n\n257\n00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:48.000\nWe also have our CD-ROM which\nis identified as a disk as well.\n\n258\n00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.580\nBut we're not going to be messing with\nthat and configuring that in any way.\n\n259\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.210\nHopefully we'll reconnect here.\n\n260\n00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.392\nLet me just try to relaunch this lab.\n\n261\n00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:02.650\nI think it's just early in the morning and\nour machines trying to wake up.\n\n262\n00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.777\nThat's what I'm blaming it on.\n\n263\n00:16:05.777 --> 00:16:09.292\nAll right So,\nif we take a look at disk one,\n\n264\n00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:14.850\nour 10 gig drive, first of all,\nit says not initialized.\n\n265\n00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.525\nAnd, this is really simple,\nif I just right-click on it,\n\n266\n00:16:18.525 --> 00:16:22.430\nI have the ability to go ahead and\ninitialize that disk, okay?\n\n267\n00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.980\nNow this one was already brought online.\n\n268\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.300\nSo here we got our wizard that or\nwindow that pops right back up again.\n\n269\n00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.610\nAnd I have to select MBR, GPT,\nwhich I will explain in a few moments.\n\n270\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.580\nBut, it's also prompting me, hey,\ndisk two is also not initialized, and\n\n271\n00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.120\nI could select or\ndeselect that, if I wanted to.\n\n272\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.860\nBut we'll just initialize both,\nand I'll hit OK.\n\n273\n00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.227\nAnd I'll explain the difference between\nthose partitions styles and schemas.\n\n274\n00:16:48.227 --> 00:16:52.256\nBut from here,\nI have my unallocated space,\n\n275\n00:16:52.256 --> 00:16:57.570\nthis black bar with the stripes\nhere is indicating, well.\n\n276\n00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.040\nWhen you click on it\nthe stripes are there, but\n\n277\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.350\nthe black indicates that it's unallocated.\n\n278\n00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:07.170\nWhich means it hasn't been formatted,\nthere's been no type of configuration, so\n\n279\n00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.100\nit's not usable.\n\n280\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.960\nYou can't store information on it,\nas of yet.\n\n281\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.059\nIf we right click on this space,\nwe have a couple options here.\n\n282\n00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:22.420\nWhat we wanna do, is just create this\ndisk to become converted to dynamic.\n\n283\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.460\nBecause, right now you can see that\nit's listed as basic over here.\n\n284\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.680\nSo, if we right click over here,\nwe can select, and\n\n285\n00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.550\nwe'll get in the other\ncreating the volumes.\n\n286\n00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.127\nAnd then different types of that\nthe different options that we have there,\n\n287\n00:17:36.127 --> 00:17:37.272\nwe'll explore those.\n\n288\n00:17:37.272 --> 00:17:39.180\nBut, it's really simple here.\n\n289\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.940\nIf I convert to a dynamic disk,\nI just right-click,\n\n290\n00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.970\nand I'm working with disk one, so I make\nsure disk one is selected and I hit OK.\n\n291\n00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:54.423\nIt's important to know that\nthere is a native one way\n\n292\n00:17:54.423 --> 00:17:58.205\nconversion process here in Microsoft.\n\n293\n00:17:58.205 --> 00:18:01.512\nSo now that I've created\nthis disk to dynamic.\n\n294\n00:18:01.512 --> 00:18:05.400\nIn order for me to go back and\nbring it back to a basic disc,\n\n295\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.530\nI would need to delete or remove any\nvolumes that were stored on that disc.\n\n296\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.265\nSo what does that mean to us in\na production environment, or\n\n297\n00:18:13.265 --> 00:18:14.478\nanyone in the real world?\n\n298\n00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:20.941\nRight, it means that information that's\nstored on that volume has to be removed.\n\n299\n00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:23.916\nSo if you plan on removing it,\nyou are gonna wanna,\n\n300\n00:18:23.916 --> 00:18:25.725\nif you wanna retain that data.\n\n301\n00:18:25.725 --> 00:18:30.658\nYou'll want to back it up, and\nthen you'll be able to convert that disk\n\n302\n00:18:30.658 --> 00:18:35.400\nback from dynamic, or\nI should say from dynamic back to basic.\n\n303\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.461\nSo, let's take a look at how\nthat would actually work.\n\n304\n00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:41.802\nIf I right-click on this\nunallocated space, and\n\n305\n00:18:41.802 --> 00:18:45.828\nI'll just create a new simple volume here,\nwhich is walking me through this wizard.\n\n306\n00:18:45.828 --> 00:18:48.298\nAnd if this is unfamiliar to you,\n\n307\n00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:52.721\nwe will go through this several times,\nso no worries here.\n\n308\n00:18:52.721 --> 00:18:55.993\nSo, in megabytes,\nbecause my disk here is ten gigs,\n\n309\n00:18:55.993 --> 00:18:59.137\nwe'll just say hey,\nlet's create a ten gig disk.\n\n310\n00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:02.884\nBut note that the unit of\nmeasurement is megabytes here,\n\n311\n00:19:02.884 --> 00:19:06.096\nso we'll type in 5,000, we'll hit Next.\n\n312\n00:19:06.096 --> 00:19:11.190\nAnd we'll just keep it at E here,\nthat's fine, we'll hit Next.\n\n313\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:17.098\nKeep it at NTFS and\nperform a quick format.\n\n314\n00:19:17.098 --> 00:19:20.294\nAll right, now we'll give it a second,\n\n315\n00:19:20.294 --> 00:19:24.712\nit shouldn't take very long,\nbut if I try to go ahead and\n\n316\n00:19:24.712 --> 00:19:30.350\nformat it back to basic,\nyou'll notice here that it's grayed out.\n\n317\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.321\nIt's says, convert to basic, and\n\n318\n00:19:32.321 --> 00:19:36.273\nthat's because I have a volume on\nthis storage space here on this disk.\n\n319\n00:19:36.273 --> 00:19:40.459\nSo what I need to do is\nactually delete this volume.\n\n320\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.830\nAnd when I'm working in\nthe graphical user interface,\n\n321\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.490\nI get these really great warning\nnotifications and messages.\n\n322\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.428\nWe'll also take a look at managing our\ndisks via command line interfaces.\n\n323\n00:19:52.428 --> 00:19:55.830\nWe don't usually get those\nnotifications in the command line.\n\n324\n00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.530\nSo this is a great place to start,\nif you need a little bit of confidence, or\n\n325\n00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.570\nyou need to get familiar with\nhow these processes work.\n\n326\n00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.517\nSo we'll just take yes, and\nonce that volume is deleted,\n\n327\n00:20:07.517 --> 00:20:09.512\nit should only take a few seconds here.\n\n328\n00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:13.192\nWe're back to our unallocated\nspace,and it is only then,\n\n329\n00:20:13.192 --> 00:20:15.610\nthat I could change it to-\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee,\n\n330\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.700\nI noticed that when you actually ended\nup deleting off that trigger volume,\n\n331\n00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.808\nit looks like it converted it for you.\n\n332\n00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:22.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI almost forgot about that Ronnie,\n\n333\n00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.319\nit's pretty cool that it does that.\n\n334\n00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:26.431\nSo you don't have to, so if you see that\nlike Ronnie is mentioning right here,\n\n335\n00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:27.700\nlet me zoom in for you.\n\n336\n00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.700\nWell, that's pretty big.\n\n337\n00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.430\nSo you can definitely see that\nit is now back to a Basic disk.\n\n338\n00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.550\nSo that is something that\nthe objectives call out,\n\n339\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.670\nand I just wanna make sure\nthat you are aware of.\n\n340\n00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.610\nBut we're gonna be spending more\ntime here with our disks anyway, so\n\n341\n00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.210\nwe'll get pretty familiar with them.\n\n342\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.927\nNow let me pull up TechNet,\n\n343\n00:20:44.927 --> 00:20:48.821\nso that we can talk about our\npartitioning schemes or styles.\n\n344\n00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:52.400\nSo, if I can find them, here we go.\n\n345\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.338\nSo, this is some really great information.\n\n346\n00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:59.982\nIf we talk about MBR versus GPT,\nand we can see in this diagram.\n\n347\n00:20:59.982 --> 00:21:03.130\nWell, let me zoom in a little bit,\nso we can see better.\n\n348\n00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.667\nThat these are going to be those four\npartitions that I was referencing with our\n\n349\n00:21:07.667 --> 00:21:09.052\nlimitations with MBR.\n\n350\n00:21:09.052 --> 00:21:15.800\nThey are just showing some here on our\nGPT, but remember you can have up to 128.\n\n351\n00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.980\nAnd the way that this\ninformation is stored.\n\n352\n00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:24.780\nSo with MBR, the master boot record\nis stored on one sector of the disk.\n\n353\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.820\nIf that sector becomes corrupt,\nwell then, you've guessed it.\n\n354\n00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.352\nYou're not gonna be able to boot.\n\n355\n00:21:29.352 --> 00:21:33.982\nSo what GP does is they\nprovide redundancy, but\n\n356\n00:21:33.982 --> 00:21:39.559\nhere you have some backup,\nGUID partition entry array.\n\n357\n00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:46.290\nThe information is broken up onto several\nsectors physically on those disks.\n\n358\n00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:51.780\nAnd allows for resiliency,\nif one of those sectors fails,\n\n359\n00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.800\nwell, no biggie, that information\nis stored in another sector.\n\n360\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.708\nSo you can see that there's a little\nmore as far as the initial, or\n\n361\n00:21:59.708 --> 00:22:04.717\nthe intuitive design of these\nschemas here for these partitions.\n\n362\n00:22:04.717 --> 00:22:06.325\nNow let me zoom back out, and\n\n363\n00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:09.550\nwe'll just kind of look at\nsome other comparisons here.\n\n364\n00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.260\nCherokee, if GPT is so\ngreat at GUID partition tables,\n\n365\n00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.290\nwhy would we choose to use MBR?\n\n366\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.910\nWell, that's a great question.\n\n367\n00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.930\nIf you look at this list right here,\nit says can be read by.\n\n368\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.310\nAnd it has Microsoft DOS,\nWindows 95, Windows 98.\n\n369\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:31.650\nNow, ideally, hopefully you're not\nworking in those kind of environments.\n\n370\n00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:37.030\nBut if you are, and you may be, then\nthis is something to consider as well.\n\n371\n00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:41.913\nSo if you're working with any kind of\nlegacy systems, then note that MBR is\n\n372\n00:22:41.913 --> 00:22:45.883\ngoing to be supporting\nthe backwards compatibility there.\n\n373\n00:22:45.883 --> 00:22:50.012\nAnd basic disks are usually formatted\nwith MBR, because when we looked at basic\n\n374\n00:22:50.012 --> 00:22:53.700\ndisks, we saw that backwards\ncompatibility there, as well.\n\n375\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.234\nNow, if you're working on a system,\nremember GPT, GUID partition table,\n\n376\n00:22:58.234 --> 00:23:00.062\nis part of the UEFI interface.\n\n377\n00:23:00.062 --> 00:23:04.682\nSo if you're working on a system whose\nmotherboard does not support UEFI,\n\n378\n00:23:04.682 --> 00:23:09.593\nthen you are gonna be limited and confined\nto running with an MBR format as well,\n\n379\n00:23:09.593 --> 00:23:11.376\nso that's another reason.\n\n380\n00:23:11.376 --> 00:23:16.430\nThe maximum size of basic volumes,\nthey have two terabytes for both here.\n\n381\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:22.479\nBut, when we're talking about dynamic,\nthen that number changes greatly.\n\n382\n00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:29.190\nAnd we're talking all the way up, almost\nto zettabyte here for our GPT disks.\n\n383\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:33.024\nSo there's quite a lot to consider\nwhen you're looking at those two.\n\n384\n00:23:33.024 --> 00:23:36.839\nI think those are the basics\nthere as far as selection goes.\n\n385\n00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.440\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee,\nis there any other limitation or\n\n386\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.929\nanything that I need to have if I want to\nuse GPT, as far as that hardware goes?\n\n387\n00:23:46.929 --> 00:23:48.207\n&gt;&gt; As far as the hardware goes?\n\n388\n00:23:48.207 --> 00:23:53.490\nSo our-\n&gt;&gt; Let's take, for example, the UEFI.\n\n389\n00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:57.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, so\nyour motherboard has to support UEFI.\n\n390\n00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.450\nSo aside from that,\nwhat are you referencing?\n\n391\n00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:04.780\n&gt;&gt; Nope, that's pretty much it, because\nwith MBR, you don't have to have UEFI.\n\n392\n00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.250\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n393\n00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:11.737\n&gt;&gt; So if you want to actually run GPT,\nyou have to have UEFI, right?\n\n394\n00:24:11.737 --> 00:24:12.267\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n395\n00:24:12.267 --> 00:24:14.455\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay, just to clarify,\n\n396\n00:24:14.455 --> 00:24:17.912\nthat's another thing that's\nreally gonna limit you there.\n\n397\n00:24:17.912 --> 00:24:18.720\nIs if, hey, maybe,\n\n398\n00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.280\nyou're not even able to select this,\nbecause my system doesn't support it.\n\n399\n00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.040\nSo then you're kind of stuck with that.\n\n400\n00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.230\nBut let's take a look at\nhow we would switch that.\n\n401\n00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:32.170\nIt's very simple, my system does support\nboth, so let's take a look at that here.\n\n402\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.060\nAnd if I can find the machine\nthat I was working on.\n\n403\n00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.718\nIt's just disconnected, let me try to\nreconnect to that here in our interface.\n\n404\n00:24:45.134 --> 00:24:47.810\nAll right,\nwe're not trying to scan anything here.\n\n405\n00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.558\nLet me just pull up Server Manager, and\nlet's get back into disk management there.\n\n406\n00:25:00.487 --> 00:25:03.710\nIt's really simple,\nit'll just take a second to show you guys.\n\n407\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.360\nIf I right-click back on disk one,\nit really is that simple.\n\n408\n00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.500\nYou just select Convert to MBR,\nand voila, that's it.\n\n409\n00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.800\nSo, we will be performing\nadditional configurations.\n\n410\n00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.184\nIt's a good place for\nus to start, but Ronnie,\n\n411\n00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.523\nI think we're gonna have\na multi parter here.\n\n412\n00:25:21.523 --> 00:25:23.778\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\nwell thank you again for\n\n413\n00:25:23.778 --> 00:25:27.929\nhelping us to understand a little bit more\nabout the idea here of working with disk,\n\n414\n00:25:27.929 --> 00:25:29.849\nat least at the Windows Server level.\n\n415\n00:25:29.849 --> 00:25:34.846\nRemember that Cherokee showed us how\nto differentiate the idea of basic and\n\n416\n00:25:34.846 --> 00:25:35.884\ndynamic disk.\n\n417\n00:25:35.884 --> 00:25:40.670\nAnd we also emphasize the need of course\nto say, hey, when do we actually use it?.\n\n418\n00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:45.270\nAs well as taking a look at the GPT and\nMBR, as well.\n\n419\n00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.820\nThere's a couple of different options that\nare there that you wanna make sure that\n\n420\n00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.260\nyou also pay attention to, depending\non the need for your environment.\n\n421\n00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.350\nBut we are actually holding off for\na part two,\n\n422\n00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.360\nthen, so we're gonna sign off right now.\n\n423\n00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.920\nFor ITPRO.TV, I'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n424\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.050\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n425\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:05.180\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n426\n00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:11.159\n[MUSIC]\n\n427\n00:26:11.159 -->

00:00:08.458\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:12.095\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.117\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.117 --> 00:00:19.320\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.895\nWe're specifically focusing\nin on the exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:26.366\nWe'll be taking look at\nConfiguring Disk Part 2 right now, and\n\n9\n00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.530\nhere to help us out of course\nis gonna be Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.590\nCherokee, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.840\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, so here we are,\nwe've already talked about some of\n\n13\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.530\nthe basics of our disk configuration,\nwe understand a little bit more.\n\n14\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.990\nAnd now, you're actually gonna show\nus a lot more in the lab, aren't we?\n\n15\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're gonna hop back\ninto our lab environment here.\n\n16\n00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.950\nThere was one thing I wanted to show you,\n\n17\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.660\nfirst of all, before we get in\ndepth with our volumes here.\n\n18\n00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.785\nAnd that was just how to\ncreate a virtual disk.\n\n19\n00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:58.125\nAnd like I had mentioned before,\nwhen it comes to management,\n\n20\n00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.955\nat this point in the game,\nwe're really not differentiating too much.\n\n21\n00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:04.115\nYou'll see some slight differences there.\n\n22\n00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:07.175\nBut let's take a look at how\nwe would actually create one.\n\n23\n00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:11.175\nIf I pull disk manager,\non the left hand pane here,\n\n24\n00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:16.958\nI just right click on top of disk\nmanagement, and then select create VHD.\n\n25\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:21.265\nAnd Microsoft specifically calls this out\nin their objectives, so I would definitely\n\n26\n00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:25.890\nmake sure you know how to create and mount\nand detached and we'll do that right here.\n\n27\n00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.350\nIt's really simple, guys.\n\n28\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.233\nSo, you need to specify a location as to\nwhere you're gonna store the information\n\n29\n00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:33.734\nfor that virtual drive.\n\n30\n00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:38.984\nSo here let's say, C; and\nI'm gonna put this under plab,\n\n31\n00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:42.920\nb for my name just under my C drive there.\n\n32\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.915\nYou also need to specify a size.\n\n33\n00:01:45.915 --> 00:01:49.678\nSo remember by default,\nthere it is gonna be megabyte,\n\n34\n00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:53.770\nso we'll just specify 2 gig\ndrive here if I'm even typing.\n\n35\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.839\nMy num locks wasn't on.\n\n36\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.740\nLet's see, gotta love it.\n\n37\n00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.220\nAnd now that would not be 2 gigs.\n\n38\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.980\nAll right, there we go.\n\n39\n00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.310\nSo at this point in time,\nlet me just zoom in a little bit so\n\n40\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.333\nyou can see some of\nthe other options we have.\n\n41\n00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:13.955\nWe're not gonna go too far in\ndepth here discussing VHD versus\n\n42\n00:02:13.955 --> 00:02:16.575\nVHDX versus fixed versus dynamic.\n\n43\n00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:20.295\nThat's a conversation that's reserved for\nour Hyper-V section,\n\n44\n00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:23.705\nso just keep that in mind,\nwe will cover that though.\n\n45\n00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:30.265\nWe'll hit OK and, must be fully qualified,\nwhat did I name it as?\n\n46\n00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:31.725\nLet me try one more time here.\n\n47\n00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.030\nLet's see, create VHD.\n\n48\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.898\nI told you how simple it was, so\nsimple that Cherokee can't even do that.\n\n49\n00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:45.760\nAll righ C:\\ is what I forgot,\nplab, that's what I did.\n\n50\n00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.870\nSo don't make my mistakes,\nladies and gentlemen, all right.\n\n51\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.319\nWe'll hit OK, and\nit really should be that simple here.\n\n52\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.850\nAnd you can see it, Disk 4.\n\n53\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.950\nThis is our new little baby disk.\n\n54\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.000\nAnd, there is a color difference,\nso that's one thing that could\n\n55\n00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.850\ndenote that it's a virtual hard disk drive\njust from that visual inspection there.\n\n56\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.040\nBoth of these disks\nare down at the moment.\n\n57\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.620\nThat's what that little red tab indicates,\nso\n\n58\n00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.140\nyou can see this one that's online\ndoesn't have that red down arrow.\n\n59\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.540\nBut there we have\na virtual hard disk drive.\n\n60\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.472\nCurrently, the space on this drive, these\nare our two gigs that we had specify here\n\n61\n00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.233\nfor the size, it's currently unallocated.\n\n62\n00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:32.471\nI would just right-click,\nand well first of all,\n\n63\n00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:36.310\nI would have to initialize that\njust to be able to manage it.\n\n64\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.610\nBut then after that,\n\n65\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.820\nI would just manage it like I would\na physical disk in that aspect there.\n\n66\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.230\nNow, Let's go ahead and do that.\n\n67\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.690\nLet's initialize this disk.\n\n68\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.283\nLet's just say, hey, Disk 4 initializing\nhere with NBR, that's fine.\n\n69\n00:03:55.482 --> 00:04:00.810\nAnd, if I wanted to create a simple\nvolume, I could, it's the same process.\n\n70\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.155\nI'll just show you here, you walk\nthrough the path and that's it, finish.\n\n71\n00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:12.900\nBut, what about formatting\nthis particular drive?\n\n72\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.490\nHold on,\nI got a notification here it says,\n\n73\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.160\nyou need to format the disk drive\nin drive E before you can use it.\n\n74\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.340\nDo you wanna format it?\n\n75\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.370\nYes, we do.\n\n76\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.680\nSo, let's just hit format.\n\n77\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.620\nOkay, Let me just close out of here for\none second.\n\n78\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.360\nI have to verify that my\nfiles are not read-only\n\n79\n00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.970\nwhen we created that virtual disk,\nI kinda went through it fast.\n\n80\n00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.464\nYou can create virtual disk\ndrives that are read-only there.\n\n81\n00:04:39.464 --> 00:04:43.940\nBut I just wanna show you how easy it is\nto go ahead and detach this virtual hard\n\n82\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.470\ndisk drive because that is something\nthat they do call out in the objectives.\n\n83\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.030\nAnd you just right-click on that\nparticular virtual drive and\n\n84\n00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.920\nselect detach.\n\n85\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.630\nAnd it says, detaching this virtual hard\ndisk will make it unavailable when it is\n\n86\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.930\nattached again,\nuntil it is attached again.\n\n87\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.150\nLet me just hit Cancel and show you where\nit's actually located because we had\n\n88\n00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.160\nspecified under our C drive there.\n\n89\n00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.720\nIf I zoom in, you can see that this\ndrive is sitting there under C drive,\n\n90\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.140\nso when I do detach it, it's not gonna\nbe accessible by any end users there.\n\n91\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.513\nSo that's something to reference.\n\n92\n00:05:18.513 --> 00:05:22.856\nSo let me get back into\nour disk management, and\n\n93\n00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:28.294\nwe'll just go ahead and\ndetach it, and then we'll say OK.\n\n94\n00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:34.360\nNow, That particular drive,\nyou don't see it here anymore.\n\n95\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.890\nIf we hop back into our interface,\nI'll just hit\n\n96\n00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.430\nrefresh here to make sure that I'm\nshowing you the correct information.\n\n97\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.328\nBut that drive is still there.\n\n98\n00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:50.630\nIf I right-click on this drive,\nyou see this option to go ahead and mount.\n\n99\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.449\nSo whenever you look at the objectives and\nthey say,\n\n100\n00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.334\nmounting virtual hard disk drives,\nunmounting, so\n\n101\n00:05:56.334 --> 00:06:00.007\nin the operating system,\nwe can see attaching, detaching there.\n\n102\n00:06:00.007 --> 00:06:01.360\nAnd that's what they're referencing.\n\n103\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.720\nSo if I go ahead and\nright click and mount, all right.\n\n104\n00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.320\nLet me just minimize this.\n\n105\n00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.304\nI can see that, that disk does\nappear back in my disk management\n\n106\n00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:15.701\nconsole here to further manage that disk.\n\n107\n00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:19.615\nSo I just wanted to show you how easy it\nis to create one and how to mount and\n\n108\n00:06:19.615 --> 00:06:20.650\nunmount it.\n\n109\n00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.510\nBut we also need to talk\nabout managing volumes.\n\n110\n00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.390\nSo, when we have our disks,\n\n111\n00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.470\nwhether they be physical or virtual, and\nthen we select our partitions schemas,\n\n112\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.520\nso if we wanna use NBR or\nGPT, well what's next?\n\n113\n00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.220\nWell we need to think about what kind of\nfile system we wanna use for those disks.\n\n114\n00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.454\nSo let me pull up diagram here,\nand get to the right page.\n\n115\n00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:51.630\nDifferent types of file systems here.\n\n116\n00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.005\nWe have FAT, which is going to be, for\n\n117\n00:06:56.005 --> 00:07:00.355\nfile allocation table, this is an older,\nhopefully, you're not utilizing it but\n\n118\n00:07:00.355 --> 00:07:04.875\nif you have, for this file system here, if\nyou have a folder systems, or if you have\n\n119\n00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:08.155\na mixed environment and you need that\nadditional backwards compatibility or\n\n120\n00:07:08.155 --> 00:07:11.635\njust compatibility in general,\nthis may be an option to you.\n\n121\n00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:17.525\nThis really is not a, there are several\nlimitations with our FAT file system,\n\n122\n00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:23.620\nso I wouldn't recommend using this file\nsystem only on an as needed basis.\n\n123\n00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.700\nIf we look at the two, now remember,\n\n124\n00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.667\nthere are tons of different\nfile systems out there.\n\n125\n00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:33.976\nBut really we're talking, specifically,\nabout Windows Server operating\n\n126\n00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:39.460\nsystems here, and specifically,\nWindows Server 2012 and 2012 R2.\n\n127\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.575\nSo with 2012 and 2012 R2,\n\n128\n00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:47.147\nit's best to use NTFS or ReFS.\n\n129\n00:07:47.147 --> 00:07:51.691\nSo with NTFS, New Technology File System,\nit includes metadata,\n\n130\n00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:56.554\nit provides inspections, you can\nset disk quotas, you can implement,\n\n131\n00:07:56.554 --> 00:08:00.960\nutilize access control lists and\nimplement permissions there.\n\n132\n00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.405\nYou can utilize encryption, right,\nintegrated with encrypting file system.\n\n133\n00:08:05.405 --> 00:08:09.077\nAnd NTFS also provides compression,\n\n134\n00:08:09.077 --> 00:08:14.180\nnow NTFS allows us to\ncreate a bootable drive.\n\n135\n00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.160\nReFS, resilient file system,\n\n136\n00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.060\nis a newer type of file system\nthat has additional improvements.\n\n137\n00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.600\nIt is backwards compatible with NTFS,\nit has increased data verification and\n\n138\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.120\nerror correction, so what does that mean?\n\n139\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.330\nIf we look at NTFS,\ndoes not handle unexpected\n\n140\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.180\npower failures or any kind of\nunexpected shut downs very well.\n\n141\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.860\nA lot of times, you'll see data corruption\nassociated with those abrupt shutdowns.\n\n142\n00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:49.620\nReFS has a self healing property and,\nas a matter of fact,\n\n143\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.470\nyou don't even see some of those command\nline basis disk checking utilities that\n\n144\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.012\nyou have with NTFS systems\nbecause it automatically heals.\n\n145\n00:08:59.012 --> 00:09:03.690\nSo that's pretty cool there,\nit supports larger files, directories, and\n\n146\n00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:11.260\nvolumes by an exponential amounts here,\nused in larger in environments.\n\n147\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.040\nIt does have lower functionality\ncompared to NTFS and\n\n148\n00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.580\nwhat I mean by that is there is no\nintegrated encrypting file systems.\n\n149\n00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.250\nSo currently, there's not a way for\nReFS to encrypt those files natively.\n\n150\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.049\nIt does not provide compression,\nit really doesn't need to,\n\n151\n00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.421\nthe way that it handles the disk there.\n\n152\n00:09:31.421 --> 00:09:36.411\nAnd it doesn't provide assignments either,\nso we're not currently,\n\n153\n00:09:36.411 --> 00:09:41.398\nat the time of this recording,\nable to boot from ReFS formatted disks but\n\n154\n00:09:41.398 --> 00:09:46.258\nwho knows in the future, I think\nthat's the way Microsoft is headed.\n\n155\n00:09:46.258 --> 00:09:51.242\nBut it's really great,\nthey've configured ReFS to be\n\n156\n00:09:51.242 --> 00:09:55.600\nable almost at like an API\nfunctionality level.\n\n157\n00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.900\nSo certain business\napplications can work well and\n\n158\n00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.540\nbe backwards compatible with NTFS there.\n\n159\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.660\nSo you're still able to,\nif you're running NTFS or ReFS,\n\n160\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.740\nyou're able to access those files.\n\n161\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.890\nBut just remember it's not bootable\nat this moment in time, so\n\n162\n00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.340\nthose are some differences.\n\n163\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:21.025\nAnd there's actually,\nif you run a particular fsutil for\n\n164\n00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:24.585\ncomparison, you can actually see\nhere in the operating system,\n\n165\n00:10:24.585 --> 00:10:29.575\nthe ones in the yellow that NTFS\nprovides that ReFS currently does not.\n\n166\n00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:31.825\nSo that's just a little bit there.\n\n167\n00:10:31.825 --> 00:10:39.120\nNow, this is important because,\nit's going to be depending or\n\n168\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.840\ncontingent upon what we wanna do with\nthese disks later on down the road, right?\n\n169\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.458\nI mentioned that when\nwe use dynamic disks,\n\n170\n00:10:45.458 --> 00:10:49.433\nthere may be a reason why we're\nconfiguring them in certain ways.\n\n171\n00:10:49.433 --> 00:10:53.289\nAnd if you think back to those older,\nwell, I say older but\n\n172\n00:10:53.289 --> 00:10:57.564\nthey're still being used but\na physical read implementation.\n\n173\n00:10:57.564 --> 00:10:59.087\nRight?\n\n174\n00:10:59.087 --> 00:11:03.730\nWe can create that here within software,\nso it's pretty simple actually.\n\n175\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:09.150\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen and\n\n176\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.100\nlet's acknowledge what kind of\ndisks we have available to us.\n\n177\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.110\nWe have a 10 gig disk, a 15 gig disk and\na 20 gig disk that we can work and\n\n178\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.600\nmanipulate to perform how we want it to.\n\n179\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:26.810\nWhen we create our volumes here,\na basic volume is just that basic,\n\n180\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.860\nyou don't even see an option for it here\non the list, because it's already basic.\n\n181\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.660\nSo basic or simple volumes is a volume\nwhere the free space on a single disk or\n\n182\n00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.060\npartition is used for storage space.\n\n183\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.810\nIt can be extended on the same disk,\nbut if you move it past that disc,\n\n184\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.662\nif you're trying to store information on,\nlet's say, disk two or\n\n185\n00:11:46.662 --> 00:11:51.700\ndisk three, then it's not a basic disk\nanymore, that would be a spanned disk.\n\n186\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.380\nSo you see our first option here\nis to create a new spanned volume.\n\n187\n00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.390\nSo what does that mean?\n\n188\n00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.005\nIf I created a new span volume and\nwe'll just, we'll click Next here,\n\n189\n00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:05.880\nthis'll launch for each one of those\ntypes of volumes in the interface here,\n\n190\n00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.660\nyou'll get a, well, wizard which is nice.\n\n191\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.820\nThey're pretty similar but\nthere are some slight differences.\n\n192\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.700\nNow, currently I have disk one selected\nand I can also utilize disk two here for\n\n193\n00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.540\nmy spanned configuration, and\ndisk three is not popping up.\n\n194\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.651\nWhy?\nLet's see,\n\n195\n00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:24.850\nit's because disk three is offline.\n\n196\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.819\nIf we had brought disk three online,\nit would also be in this list as well and\n\n197\n00:12:28.819 --> 00:12:33.030\nyou'll see you need to move them over,\njust highlighting it isn't enough.\n\n198\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.945\nHere you'll need to hit Add and\nmove it over to the right side and\n\n199\n00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:39.180\nyou'll see that now we're working\nwith both of those disks.\n\n200\n00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.476\nBut that's okay,\n\n201\n00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:45.500\nI just need at least a minimum of two\ndisks here to create a spanned volume.\n\n202\n00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.524\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n203\n00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:51.443\nWell, the way that the data is actually\nstored when you're using spanned volumes,\n\n204\n00:12:51.443 --> 00:12:54.492\nit doesn't stripe or\nright to them in equal parts and\n\n205\n00:12:54.492 --> 00:12:59.412\nequal amounts that'll will actually fill\nthem up kind of like just continuously and\n\n206\n00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:03.180\nthen once one disk is full it'll\nstart working on the other one.\n\n207\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.470\nThere is something to be said\nabout spanned volumes here.\n\n208\n00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:13.040\nWe're not implementing any kind\nof resiliency or redundancy, so\n\n209\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:19.250\nif disk two were to fail, I would lose all\nthe data that's in this particular volume.\n\n210\n00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.000\nIf disk one were to fail,\nI would lose all the data, so\n\n211\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.970\nthat's definitely something\nto consider there.\n\n212\n00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:28.530\nIt's probably not the most\nbeneficial implementation here but\n\n213\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.770\nwe'll just hit Next and\nyou can assign it a drive letter.\n\n214\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.130\nWe'll just keep this default as G and\nhit Next,\n\n215\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.510\nyou're also able to configure it.\n\n216\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:44.390\nWe'll keep the default set as perfect but\nI do wanna click perform a quick format\n\n217\n00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.170\nand that's simply because I don't\nwant you guys to have to wait.\n\n218\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.600\nIn a production environment,\nI wouldn't select this,\n\n219\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.970\nI would want it to go ahead and make sure\nthat that disk was fully formatted there.\n\n220\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:14:00.450\nWe'll hit Next, Finish,\nnow it's giving me a notification here.\n\n221\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.870\nLike I said, what's great about the GUI,\njust letting me know, hey,\n\n222\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.900\nwe're gonna be converting our basic disks.\n\n223\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:13.210\nRemember we said basic disks can not be,\nwell, on more than one disk.\n\n224\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.030\nWe've just combined two disks\ntogether to create that volume.\n\n225\n00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.400\nSo my volume, now that's it's spanning\nacross two disks, is not basic anymore.\n\n226\n00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.160\nIt's just letting you know, hey now, your\ndisks are gonna be dynamic, we hit OK.\n\n227\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.450\nAnd the way that the operating system sees\n\n228\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.470\nour disks here is kind of interesting,\nwe'll give it a second to propagate.\n\n229\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:38.160\nWe see the color change here and\nboth of these disks, disk one and\n\n230\n00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.010\ndisk two, are now joined together,\nthey're creating volume G.\n\n231\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.170\nSo from an operating system standpoint,\n\n232\n00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.380\nif we look up here,\nwe can get that detailed information.\n\n233\n00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.850\nYou don't see additional drives, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.610\nYou just see it as one, so the end\nuser would see that as one particular\n\n235\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.750\nunit of storage there for that volume.\n\n236\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.980\nThat's going to be a span drive,\nwhat do we have next?\n\n237\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.274\nWe have a striped volume and\nwe can go ahead and\n\n238\n00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:12.110\nright-click here and\nwe can just delete this volume.\n\n239\n00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.280\nAnd like I said though, remember,\n\n240\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.440\nif you delete this volume, any information\nthat's on here is going to be removed,\n\n241\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.720\nany information that's on\neither one of those drives.\n\n242\n00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.990\nSo if you delete either one of\nthose in this management interface,\n\n243\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.460\nyou do need to be aware of that.\n\n244\n00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.370\nAnd it was just prompting us to\nremember that little factoid.\n\n245\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:34.100\nNow, let's talk about a striped volume,\nall right?\n\n246\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.376\nA striped volume,\nalso sometimes called RAID 0,\n\n247\n00:15:37.376 --> 00:15:42.110\nsimply because it's providing zero\nredundancy in this configuration.\n\n248\n00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:47.740\nWe're just striping and\nwe are striping in an equal manner,\n\n249\n00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:53.300\nso let's use both or all three of these\ndisks for our particular stripe here.\n\n250\n00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:59.786\nLet's bring this one online, and notice\nhow these disks are different sizes.\n\n251\n00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:02.518\nAnd if you think back\nto RAID configurations,\n\n252\n00:16:02.518 --> 00:16:06.791\nif I'm talking about RAID configs,\nI need to be using hard disk drives,\n\n253\n00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:09.192\nphysical drives, all of the same size.\n\n254\n00:16:09.192 --> 00:16:11.243\nOtherwise, I'll be wasting storage.\n\n255\n00:16:11.243 --> 00:16:14.332\nSo if I look at this one 10 gig,\n15, and 20 gig,\n\n256\n00:16:14.332 --> 00:16:17.300\nmy common denominator here\nis going to be 10 gig.\n\n257\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.000\nSo that's going to be the most\n\n258\n00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.940\namount of storage that I can\nadd to my striped volume here.\n\n259\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.700\nAnd you'll see how we go through and\nconfigure that.\n\n260\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.466\nSo let's go ahead and\nset up a new striped volume.\n\n261\n00:16:30.466 --> 00:16:33.050\nAnd again, it will launch our wizard here.\n\n262\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.235\nSo now you see that we have\nbrought disk 3 online, and\n\n263\n00:16:37.235 --> 00:16:41.152\nyou can bring both of those\non over to add them too.\n\n264\n00:16:41.152 --> 00:16:44.517\nAnd look at this size as well,\nyou can see how that's increasing here for\n\n265\n00:16:44.517 --> 00:16:46.410\nthe amount that's available.\n\n266\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:52.000\nWe'll just keep that as G again,\nlike from our previous demonstration.\n\n267\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.652\nPerform a quick format.\n\n268\n00:16:55.652 --> 00:16:58.960\nAll right, we are good, and finish.\n\n269\n00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.600\nYes, we're converting to dynamic.\n\n270\n00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:03.730\nAnd give it a second.\n\n271\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.100\nAnd you'll notice how\nthe operating system handles.\n\n272\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.500\nI didn't really granularly\nspecify my sizes there.\n\n273\n00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.640\nSo we'll see how it handles it for\nus, which is nice.\n\n274\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.445\nNotice how for my 15 gig drive here for\n\n275\n00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:19.707\ndisk two I still have five\nremaining of unallocated space.\n\n276\n00:17:19.707 --> 00:17:24.210\nAnd then for my 20 gig, remember disc\nthree here was originally 20 gig.\n\n277\n00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.573\nSo now I have 10 gigs as my\nremainder of unallocated space.\n\n278\n00:17:28.573 --> 00:17:36.163\nSo again, with a striped volume,\nall of these drives are necessary for\n\n279\n00:17:36.163 --> 00:17:40.602\nhaving and retaining that information.\n\n280\n00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:43.752\nIf one of these drives\nwere to physically fail,\n\n281\n00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:48.478\nto have some kind of hardware failure,\nI would lose all the information\n\n282\n00:17:48.478 --> 00:17:52.210\nthat's striped here across\nall three of these drives.\n\n283\n00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.270\nSo that's something to consider, as well.\n\n284\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.580\nIf you wanted to implement\nany kind of resiliency there,\n\n285\n00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.220\nyou would need to also add parody.\n\n286\n00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.190\nSo we have the ability to do that as well.\n\n287\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.350\nLet's just go ahead and\ndelete this volume so\n\n288\n00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.930\nwe can get back to our\nunallocated drives here.\n\n289\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.480\nAnd I'll show you how to\ncreate a software RAID-5.\n\n290\n00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.747\nIf we right click on one of these drives\nand we'll select New RAID-5 Volume.\n\n291\n00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.423\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n292\n00:18:21.423 --> 00:18:24.980\nMinimum of at least three physical\ndrives for this configuration.\n\n293\n00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.340\nGood thing I have three!\n\n294\n00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.680\nWe'll hit add, and next.\n\n295\n00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.890\nAgain, the same thing with the storage.\n\n296\n00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.220\nWe're only going to be able to effectively\nutilize ten gigs of storage in this\n\n297\n00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.490\nconfiguration.\n\n298\n00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.670\nAnd we'll hit perform a correct format so\nwe're not waiting all day and finish.\n\n299\n00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.760\nIt's really that easy, guys.\n\n300\n00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.850\nNow remember,\n\n301\n00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.670\nwith our RAID-5 configurations,\nwe do have that parody bit, so we may see\n\n302\n00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.220\na bit of performance degradation because\nwe're performing that algorithm there.\n\n303\n00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.060\nBut we also reap the benefit\nof having that resiliency.\n\n304\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:02.710\nSo that would be dependent on why we\nwould want to go ahead and do that.\n\n305\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.750\nAnd so it's pretty cool that the operating\nsystem will actually be able to detect and\n\n306\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:12.000\nalert you and then go ahead and rebuild\nany failed drive that you may have there\n\n307\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.610\nas long as you have physically\na replacement drive available as well.\n\n308\n00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.810\nThere is one that I don't have here on my\nnotes but I did see from that drop down\n\n309\n00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.650\naction menu, and it's just gonna\ntake a little minute to go ahead and\n\n310\n00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.630\nresync and to get these drives configured.\n\n311\n00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.410\nBut remember,\n\n312\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.340\nit's very simple just like we saw in\nthese other wizards, how easy it was.\n\n313\n00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.980\nYou also have the ability to\ncreate mirroring as well.\n\n314\n00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.530\nAnd so remember mirroring is just\nan exact replication, an exact duplicate.\n\n315\n00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.520\nAnd when you create a mirrored volume,\nit doesn't matter if one of those physical\n\n316\n00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.650\ndrives has a failure, because that\ninformation is retained in two spaces.\n\n317\n00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.361\nSo there are pros and cons to each, so\n\n318\n00:19:55.361 --> 00:20:00.182\nthe pros being that data resiliency\nthere with mirrored drives.\n\n319\n00:20:00.182 --> 00:20:05.496\nYour cons would be the fact that\nyou're getting 50% of your expense for\n\n320\n00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:11.339\nyour storage there, because you're\nonly utilizing 50% of that disk space.\n\n321\n00:20:11.339 --> 00:20:14.935\nCuz you're paying for two drives and\nyou're only getting to save to one for\n\n322\n00:20:14.935 --> 00:20:15.918\nthat storage size.\n\n323\n00:20:15.918 --> 00:20:19.754\nSo that would be something\nto consider there.\n\n324\n00:20:19.754 --> 00:20:22.849\nAnd just a couple other side notes\nhere when we're talking about volumes.\n\n325\n00:20:22.849 --> 00:20:25.315\nI have some little tidbits.\n\n326\n00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:30.249\nIn TFS volumes can be expanded and shrunk.\n\n327\n00:20:30.249 --> 00:20:34.201\nNow, REFSS volumes can only be expanded.\n\n328\n00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:37.083\nAnd when we're looking at\nour FAT configurations,\n\n329\n00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:39.253\nthose partitions cannot be modified.\n\n330\n00:20:39.253 --> 00:20:44.201\nAnd I think that's about it for now,\nworking in the graphical user interface.\n\n331\n00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:50.002\nWhenever we come back, I'd like to\nintroduce some command line tools.\n\n332\n00:20:50.002 --> 00:20:53.978\nAnd we'll look at how we can use different\ntools to be able to perform the same\n\n333\n00:20:53.978 --> 00:20:58.220\nfunctions, and manage and shrink and\nexpand, but from a different interface.\n\n334\n00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n335\n00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.410\nWell thank you again for\nhelping us out here.\n\n336\n00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.330\nTaking a look at Disk Management and\n\n337\n00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.660\nthe way we can create some of the\ndifferent rays that we have right there.\n\n338\n00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.960\nCherokee showed us how to do the stripe as\nwell as the span volume and the mirror.\n\n339\n00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.832\nNo, did you do the mirror?\n\n340\n00:21:14.832 --> 00:21:17.110\n&gt;&gt; We didn't show the mirror,\nbut we could.\n\n341\n00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.080\nBut I'm just still waiting.\n\n342\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.981\nI was re-syncing here at 70%.\n\n343\n00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:21.420\nSo it's really that easy.\n\n344\n00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty easy.\n\n345\n00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.100\nIt's still the same thing.\n\n346\n00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.760\nAnd the key here also is, especially\nin the ones that Cherokee showed you,\n\n347\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.830\nis to remember that those disc sizes\npretty much have to be the same size.\n\n348\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.280\nThe spanned one is probably\nthe only one where you can actually\n\n349\n00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.180\ntake more in one and\nless in another if you actually chose to.\n\n350\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.580\nBut overall though,\nyou do tend to see that.\n\n351\n00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.280\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nI do want to point out one other thing.\n\n352\n00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.680\nThe reason we're covering this,\n\n353\n00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.540\nobviously, is because it was called out in\nthe objectives and this is an exam series.\n\n354\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.960\nSo I will note that in real life,\nyes, you do have these abilities.\n\n355\n00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.090\nMicrosoft provided you the ability\nto create these configurations\n\n356\n00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.590\nin the operating system.\n\n357\n00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:03.010\nBut in my opinion, it's always better\nto perform a physical hardware RAID\n\n358\n00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:10.160\nconfiguration and use separate hardware to\ngo ahead and off-load those computations.\n\n359\n00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.100\nThat's my opinion but this is\na Microsoft certification series so\n\n360\n00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.880\nwe are covering it that way.\n\n361\n00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.900\nAll right, Cherokee,\nwell that sounds great but\n\n362\n00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.380\nare you sure there's nothing\nelse you wanna show us?\n\n363\n00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.940\n&gt;&gt; How did you know Ronnie I actually just\nhad that RAID-5 configuration complete.\n\n364\n00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:32.280\nSo what I can do is I deleted that and\nI'll show you here one last little tidbit.\n\n365\n00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:37.169\nWhat I wanted to do is show\nyou how to mount a drive.\n\n366\n00:22:37.169 --> 00:22:38.347\nSo if we right click and\n\n367\n00:22:38.347 --> 00:22:42.564\nselect, just let's say, New Simple Volume\nand it will run through the wizard.\n\n368\n00:22:42.564 --> 00:22:46.454\nI really didn't specify here one of\nthe options that we do have, and\n\n369\n00:22:46.454 --> 00:22:48.470\nI just wanna plan that to you.\n\n370\n00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.138\nIt's not something that you'll\nbe doing on a daily, well,\n\n371\n00:22:51.138 --> 00:22:52.512\nprobably not on a daily basis.\n\n372\n00:22:52.512 --> 00:22:54.813\nBut something that may be beneficial,\n\n373\n00:22:54.813 --> 00:22:59.208\nespecially if you wanted to create like\na shared folder and have people from\n\n374\n00:22:59.208 --> 00:23:03.550\none department centrally store\ninformations and we can do that this way.\n\n375\n00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.850\nSo, you could select,\nMount the following empty NTFS folder.\n\n376\n00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.050\nYou do have to have\na completely empty folder.\n\n377\n00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:17.350\nYou can't mount a drive to a folder\nthat has other information,\n\n378\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.530\nother objects in it.\n\n379\n00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.930\nSo I've created a blank\nfolder called sales, and\n\n380\n00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.540\nwe'll just navigate to that sales folder.\n\n381\n00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:29.093\ni just dropped it straight under my c\ndrive to make it easy for us here and\n\n382\n00:23:29.093 --> 00:23:33.817\nyou can see that Sales folder that had\nbeen created, and you just hit OK.\n\n383\n00:23:33.817 --> 00:23:36.949\nAnd then Next, and\nyou have all the same options\n\n384\n00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:41.268\nthat we saw previously when we're\nrunning through this wizard.\n\n385\n00:23:41.268 --> 00:23:45.025\nBut the operating system\nhandles it differently, and\n\n386\n00:23:45.025 --> 00:23:48.380\nit appears differently to\nthe end users as well.\n\n387\n00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.060\nSo let's go ahead and format that disk.\n\n388\n00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.000\nAnd, again I've got that notification,\nbut don't worry about that now.\n\n389\n00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.960\nI wanna show you how the operating\nsystem is actually handling that.\n\n390\n00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:06.220\nSo, if I drilled down to my C drive,\nI can actually see that the Sales,\n\n391\n00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.620\nthe folder that I had created\nis being used as a drive now.\n\n392\n00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:15.060\nSo it's mounted, so you could go ahead and\ntreat that like a shared folder,\n\n393\n00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.260\nif I wanted to as well.\n\n394\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.910\nSo that's just one other\noption we have there.\n\n395\n00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.700\nAnd, Ronnie, I promise that's it.\n\n396\n00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.814\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; For this show.\n\n397\n00:24:22.814 --> 00:24:24.710\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Cherokee.\n\n398\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.080\nWell, once again, thank you for\nhelping us out and\n\n399\n00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.110\ntaking a look at more of the details\ninside of disk management.\n\n400\n00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.207\nShowing us the options that we available\nto configure the disc in the ways that\n\n401\n00:24:34.207 --> 00:24:36.866\nwe've talked about the spanned and\nthe striped.\n\n402\n00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:40.300\nNow even those mount points\nthat we have available to us.\n\n403\n00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.940\nBut that's not all that there\nis to this configuration.\n\n404\n00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.150\nJust like everything else in Microsoft.\n\n405\n00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.830\nIt also means that there's\na lot of PowerShell to come.\n\n406\n00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.500\nAnd that is probably what Cherokee's\ngonna be showing us as well in\n\n407\n00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.810\nprobably the next episode here or so.\n\n408\n00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.610\nSo you wanna stay tuned for that as well.\n\n409\n00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:02.290\nSo signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n410\n00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.370\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n411\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:07.655\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n412\n00:25:10.124 --> 00:25:12.173\n[MUSIC]\n\n413\n00:25:12.173 --> 00:25:18.554\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:07.927\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:12.295\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode right\n\n5\n00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:14.551\nhere on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:19.500\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.990\nWe're specifically going to be\ntaking a look at exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.800\nAnd we're also going to be taking\na look into storage spaces as well.\n\n9\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.390\nAnd here to help us out, of course,\nis going to be miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.590\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.\n\n11\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.540\nI'm surprised you haven't\nkicked me out yet,\n\n12\n00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.670\nbecause I know we've been talking\nabout storage for a long time.\n\n13\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.730\nBut it's super important, guys.\n\n14\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760\nI wouldn't be stressing it if it wasn't.\n\n15\n00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.000\nBusinesses today are relying\non data retention.\n\n16\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.790\nThere are entire subsets of fields out\nthere just for this specific purpose,\n\n17\n00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.530\nbecause we are accumulating more and\nmore data.\n\n18\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.000\nAnd I don't really see that\ngoing away any time soon.\n\n19\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.610\nSo it's very important to set yourself up\n\n20\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.310\nin a good position to really have\na good understanding of storage pools.\n\n21\n00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.010\nSo that is what I hope to\naccomplish here today.\n\n22\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.530\nThe ideas that we're gonna be talking\nabout, I remember when I was studying\n\n23\n00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.130\nsome of the terminologies was a little\nconvoluted, and got a little mixed up.\n\n24\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.010\nSo I really wanna clarify that for you as\nwell, so that you can not only understand\n\n25\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.610\nthe ideas, but you can sound intelligent\nwhen you are articulating to your peers.\n\n26\n00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.340\nSo let's take at my screen here.\n\n27\n00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.610\nAnd I have a diagram, and\n\n28\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.870\nRonnie was making fun of me-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n29\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Because I put it in a triangle here.\n\n30\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.212\nBut everything in IT, all the diagrams\nare always in triangles, so\n\n31\n00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:37.520\nI figured hey, why not?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Why not?\n\n32\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the disk enclosure is behind\n\n33\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.460\nme, but that's okay.\n\n34\n00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.900\nWe really don't have to go full screen,\n\n35\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.790\nbut thanks Megan,\nbecause I did a really poor job.\n\n36\n00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.060\nBut what I'm trying to represent here\nis some kind of a disc enclosure.\n\n37\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.940\nSo Microsoft actually offers\na Storage Server 2012,\n\n38\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.649\nand server storage.\n\n39\n00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.980\nI'm saying this wrong.\n\n40\n00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.700\nServer Storage 2012 and\nServer Storage 2012 R2.\n\n41\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.620\nNow that particular\n\n42\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.710\nspecific operating system was designed\nto create storage appliances.\n\n43\n00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.360\nYou don't have to use that\nparticular configuration.\n\n44\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.632\nYou can use other brands and\nvendor types of disk enclosures.\n\n45\n00:02:21.632 --> 00:02:27.390\nSo a disk enclosure, remember, this one, I\ntried to make a rack mount disk enclosure.\n\n46\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.090\nBut that's what we came up with here.\n\n47\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.770\nSo there are a lot of features that\nwork with the operating system.\n\n48\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.385\nEspecially when you're using iSCSI\nservices that allow information to be\n\n49\n00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.740\nshared between that disk enclosure.\n\n50\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.790\nEven things like temperature and so forth,\n\n51\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.780\njust to make sure that those\ndisks are being managed.\n\n52\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.655\nNow, that's one option that we have,\nbecause it is called out on the objectives\n\n53\n00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:56.460\nto understand that we can\nutilize disk enclosures.\n\n54\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.497\nWe can also have,\n\n55\n00:02:57.497 --> 00:03:02.000\non my left-hand side here,\nthese are supposed to be hard drives.\n\n56\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.710\nAnd yeah, that's as best as I've\ngot there too as well, Ronnie.\n\n57\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.780\nBut these are supposed to be\nreferencing spindle drives.\n\n58\n00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.130\nSo our optical drive's there.\n\n59\n00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.925\nBut also, with storage pools.\n\n60\n00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:18.790\nSo we're able to take not only\n\n61\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.110\nexact or similar types of drives,\nwe can have a really varied and\n\n62\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.110\nmixed, diverse bunch of drives\nto concatenate them and\n\n63\n00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.900\naggregate them for use, to be organized,\nand then allocated accordingly.\n\n64\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.610\nSo we have some options,\nstorage pools is very flexible.\n\n65\n00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.970\nSo far in these series we've taken a look\nat different ways that we can manage.\n\n66\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.670\nWe started with an older,\n\n67\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.440\nmore historical approach when we were just\nlooking at our basic and dynamic disks.\n\n68\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.100\nAnd like I said, Storage Pools is really\naiming to replace those dynamic disks.\n\n69\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.420\nSo we do have this option right here in\nthe software, but it also works really\n\n70\n00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.160\nnicely, and compliments the hardware\noptions that we have available to us.\n\n71\n00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.170\nSo either way,\nwe can look back at this diagram.\n\n72\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.620\nIf I choose to work with direct-attached\nstorage, or disk enclosures, a combination\n\n73\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.120\nof the two, I can use all sort of\ndifferent types of buses for my discs.\n\n74\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.510\nIt really doesn't matter,\nbecause I can take these discs and\n\n75\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.200\nthen I can create what are called pools,\nstorage pools.\n\n76\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.773\nSometimes people say Disk Pools.\n\n77\n00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:38.206\nBut they are basically a way\nto organize the amount of\n\n78\n00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:42.140\nstorage that you have available to you.\n\n79\n00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:50.370\nFrom our storage pools, you can create\nsomething called storage spaces.\n\n80\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.260\nSo let me just give,\nthere's a lot of little details,\n\n81\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.930\ncaveats, minutiae here that\nyou should be aware of.\n\n82\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.030\nThe good news is, for 7410 you're not\nexpected to know every single one of them.\n\n83\n00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.940\nI'm gonna touch on the most\nimportant information here\n\n84\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.510\nin a production environment.\n\n85\n00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.212\nI've been meaning to do that,\n\n86\n00:05:09.212 --> 00:05:12.280\nI want to show you right here\nStorage Spaces Overview.\n\n87\n00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.030\nThere's a link here\nalso in the show notes.\n\n88\n00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.930\nThere is really great documentation\nto support all of these facts,\n\n89\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.490\nand there are FAQs.\n\n90\n00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.239\nAnd if you're working with storage spaces,\nand you don't feel comfortable with them,\n\n91\n00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:30.026\nand you're in a business\nproduction environment,\n\n92\n00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:32.258\nI would highly implore you to check that.\n\n93\n00:05:32.258 --> 00:05:33.217\nImplore you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:05:33.217 --> 00:05:35.360\n&gt;&gt; I can speak today.\n\n95\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.830\nTo check that out.\n\n96\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.420\nBut we're gonna cover the highlights here.\n\n97\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.070\nSo if I go back to the diagram,\nthis should really help with this idea.\n\n98\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.390\nBecause I can only have [COUGH] a physical\ndisc, a part of one particular pool.\n\n99\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.600\nSo what that means is my pools can\nhave up to 160 physical disks.\n\n100\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.680\nWhich seems like a good amount here.\n\n101\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.870\nBut you can have multiple pools as well.\n\n102\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.600\nFrom your multiple pools,\nyou can create the spaces, which\n\n103\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.705\nyou can call them, actually,\nMicrosoft calls them virtual disks.\n\n104\n00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:15.745\nThat's the term that they use.\n\n105\n00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:20.365\nSo the spaces that you're creating,\nyour virtual disks, can be pooled.\n\n106\n00:06:20.365 --> 00:06:23.085\nSo I can have, in this diagram example,\n\n107\n00:06:23.085 --> 00:06:28.600\nI have two virtual disks that are coming\nfrom one pool, if that make sense.\n\n108\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.700\nSo you have a lot of flexibility\nwith your configuration and\n\n109\n00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.980\ndesign of how this storage is organized.\n\n110\n00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.980\nNow once I create those virtual disks,\njust like we saw in the past when we were\n\n111\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.070\ntalking about physical discs and virtual\ndisks, we had to further configure them.\n\n112\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.910\nWe had to select if they\nwere gonna be MBR or GPT.\n\n113\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.900\nThen we had to go ahead and\nconfigure those volumes.\n\n114\n00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.470\nSo that's what we can do here from our\nStorage Spaces, our virtual disks here.\n\n115\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.110\nSo I just have an example here.\n\n116\n00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.720\nIf we were to assign a drive\nletter like the F drive, or\n\n117\n00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.710\nwhatever drive letter you chose.\n\n118\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.572\nOr you could also,\nlike we had just seen in the other shows,\n\n119\n00:07:10.572 --> 00:07:15.480\nmount it and have it appear as\na folder from the end user side.\n\n120\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.300\nSo starting all the way down\nhere at our physical drives,\n\n121\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.860\nworking our way up, that should give\nyou an idea of where we are, and\n\n122\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.770\nthen where we're going throughout\nthe rest of this show.\n\n123\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.480\nNow there are a lot of configurations.\n\n124\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.100\nI just wanna cover some of them before\nwe get into the operating system,\n\n125\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.980\nso that it can actually make sense.\n\n126\n00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.630\nBecause you'll see there are a lot of\nsettings and options, like I said.\n\n127\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.980\nIf you ever get stuck,\nthere is a lot of support on Technet, and\n\n128\n00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.400\ndifferent forums out there.\n\n129\n00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.725\nI always suggest using Microsoft sites\nthough, because there is a lot of other\n\n130\n00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:52.953\nstuff out on the internet that\nI just really don't trust.\n\n131\n00:07:52.953 --> 00:07:55.103\n[LAUGH] So\nalways stick with Microsoft there.\n\n132\n00:07:55.103 --> 00:07:58.852\nUse Bing when you're typing your questions\nin, because they're gonna put their\n\n133\n00:07:58.852 --> 00:08:01.200\ninformation at the top of\nthat search result list.\n\n134\n00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.755\nThere if you feel brave\nenough to use Bing.\n\n135\n00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:09.785\nOne of the options that you have here,\nwhen we're looking and\n\n136\n00:08:09.785 --> 00:08:14.039\nwe're creating our storage pools, you'll\nsee there's an automatic allocation and\n\n137\n00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:15.156\na manual allocation.\n\n138\n00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:23.440\nWhat I have here is just examples\nof drives on the left-hand side.\n\n139\n00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.893\nSo I have seven drives here.\n\n140\n00:08:25.893 --> 00:08:30.790\nNow, some configurations you will see,\nas we proceed,\n\n141\n00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.710\nrequire at least seven\nphysical drives to even work.\n\n142\n00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.726\nSo you may think that,\nI'm good, I'm golden,\n\n143\n00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:43.230\nI have seven drives, I can pick and\nchoose whatever configurations I want.\n\n144\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.427\nIf you select automatic allocation for\nfour of those drives, and\n\n145\n00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:51.776\nthen manual allocation,\nwhich I'll explain when we get in the OS,\n\n146\n00:08:51.776 --> 00:08:54.690\nthe operating system actually sees it.\n\n147\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.730\nIt organizes it in two different ways.\n\n148\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:02.629\nSo for those configurations like three-way\nmirroring and dual parity you cannot\n\n149\n00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:08.610\nuse them because the operating system\nsees it as two separate entities here.\n\n150\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.450\nAnd you can't assume that all seven\ndisks will be allowed to be used.\n\n151\n00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.817\nSo you really need to choose whether\nyou're gonna select automatic\n\n152\n00:09:17.817 --> 00:09:20.550\nallocation or manual allocation.\n\n153\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:25.223\nAutomatic allocation is allowing\nthe operating system to choose how those\n\n154\n00:09:25.223 --> 00:09:26.936\ndrives should be handled.\n\n155\n00:09:26.936 --> 00:09:29.020\nAnd it happens all in the background.\n\n156\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.728\nManual allocation says, I'm going\nto allow the system admin to select\n\n157\n00:09:33.728 --> 00:09:38.528\nwhich drive should come into play if\nI had a physical hard drive failure.\n\n158\n00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:43.322\nSo out of these three,\nperhaps one of them were faster,\n\n159\n00:09:43.322 --> 00:09:46.190\nnewer, larger than the others.\n\n160\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:52.090\nMaybe that would be the drive that I\nchoose to act as my replacement for\n\n161\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.337\nany kind of failed drive.\n\n162\n00:09:54.337 --> 00:09:57.930\nSo I would have to go in and\nspecify which drive to choose.\n\n163\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.343\nSo best practice, pick one, stick with it.\n\n164\n00:10:00.343 --> 00:10:05.103\nYou can configure configurations\nthat require less than seven drives,\n\n165\n00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:10.490\nlike simple drives configuring two-way\nmirroring or even single parity.\n\n166\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.713\nBut dual parity and\n\n167\n00:10:11.713 --> 00:10:16.462\nthree-way mirroring will not be\navailable in this configuration here.\n\n168\n00:10:16.462 --> 00:10:19.103\nAnd like I said,\nI'm covering some of these topics,\n\n169\n00:10:19.103 --> 00:10:22.270\nit'll make more sense after\nyou see it in the OS.\n\n170\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.503\nThe magic of this is that you can\nalways hit rewind and go back and\n\n171\n00:10:25.503 --> 00:10:27.468\nmake all these concepts work for you.\n\n172\n00:10:27.468 --> 00:10:34.580\nNow the differences between server 2012\nand server 2012 r2 are not always glaring.\n\n173\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.943\nWhen we're talking about storage\npools there are some significant\n\n174\n00:10:37.943 --> 00:10:38.950\ndifferences here.\n\n175\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.586\nSo I would like to go ahead and\ncall those out.\n\n176\n00:10:41.586 --> 00:10:46.186\nStorage tiers is a new feature,\nstorage tiers is really cool.\n\n177\n00:10:46.186 --> 00:10:52.799\nWhat I'm doing with storage tiers,\nI have the ability to properly,\n\n178\n00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:59.426\nor I guess I can utilize my hard disk\ndrives to the best optimization.\n\n179\n00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:01.572\nI'm basically saying, okay,\n\n180\n00:11:01.572 --> 00:11:05.710\nwhat's the smartest way to\nwork with these drives here?\n\n181\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:10.001\nSo in every situation,\nlike over here on the right-hand side,\n\n182\n00:11:10.001 --> 00:11:14.060\nI have four spindle drives and\nI have two solid state drives.\n\n183\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.127\nAnd maybe that's all my\nbudget will allow for.\n\n184\n00:11:19.127 --> 00:11:22.458\nSo in comparing apples to apples and\noranges to oranges here, solid state\n\n185\n00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:26.128\ndrives are gonna have higher performance,\nfaster read and write performance.\n\n186\n00:11:26.128 --> 00:11:29.026\nSo why would I not want\nto use my hot data,\n\n187\n00:11:29.026 --> 00:11:33.736\nthe data that I am accessing most\nfrequently for the solid state?\n\n188\n00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:38.909\nSo I can aggregate and\ntell the operating system which drives\n\n189\n00:11:38.909 --> 00:11:44.395\nare my solid state drives, and\nthen create a tier, a gold tier.\n\n190\n00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:46.611\nAnd there are different naming schemes out\nthere, you can choose whatever you want.\n\n191\n00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:48.905\nI just chose these colors here.\n\n192\n00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:51.399\nBut the hot data and those reads and\n\n193\n00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:54.850\nwrites will be happening\non your faster drive.\n\n194\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.194\nSo data at rest or\ndata that's not accessed as much,\n\n195\n00:11:58.194 --> 00:12:01.086\nthe operating system\nwill use a silver tier.\n\n196\n00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:05.829\nAnd you can configure those optical\ndrives to belong as a part of\n\n197\n00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:07.540\nthe silver tier here.\n\n198\n00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.197\nSo that's really a cool feature.\n\n199\n00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:11.529\nNow the second one, write back cache, so\n\n200\n00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:14.540\nyou would have to manually\nconfigure storage tiers.\n\n201\n00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.977\nI'll show you here in a little bit.\n\n202\n00:12:17.977 --> 00:12:21.040\nBut right back cache is something\nthat happens automatically.\n\n203\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.836\nBy default the operating\nsystem implements this.\n\n204\n00:12:23.836 --> 00:12:28.585\nAnd it's really cool because it\nreally complements storage tiers.\n\n205\n00:12:28.585 --> 00:12:33.080\nIt takes the vat idea, that concept, but\nbrings it up a notch to the next level.\n\n206\n00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:40.130\nSo here we're looking at it\non a per type of drive basis.\n\n207\n00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.259\nWhen you're talking\nabout right back cache,\n\n208\n00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:46.156\nyou're looking at it on a per drive basis.\n\n209\n00:12:46.156 --> 00:12:51.708\nSo the reads and\nwrites that are on each individual drive,\n\n210\n00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:56.241\nthey're gonna be creating a buffer there,\nand\n\n211\n00:12:56.241 --> 00:12:59.540\non that drive, creating a cache.\n\n212\n00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.763\nAnd those small random rates\nare gonna be stored there\n\n213\n00:13:02.763 --> 00:13:07.575\nbefore they're moved off to more permanent\nstorage on each individual drive.\n\n214\n00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:11.580\nAnd that works both with mechanical and\nsolid state drives.\n\n215\n00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.079\nSo utilizing both of those\ntogether is a really smart way\n\n216\n00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:18.387\nto optimize your hardware.\n\n217\n00:13:18.387 --> 00:13:22.931\nOkay, so with parity it's\nlike a Rave5 configuration\n\n218\n00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:27.572\nwhich utilizes erasure encoding\nthat really plays off of\n\n219\n00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:32.760\nthat arithmetic there, so\nit uses bit-wise arithmetic.\n\n220\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.596\nNow with dual parity,\nit's more like a Rave6.\n\n221\n00:13:35.596 --> 00:13:40.518\nAnd it uses something called read\nSolomon error correcting codes\n\n222\n00:13:40.518 --> 00:13:43.420\nto keep two bitwise parity symbols.\n\n223\n00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.405\nSo you're able to suffer from two hard\ndrive failures instead of just one.\n\n224\n00:13:48.405 --> 00:13:50.806\nSo that's a really cool feature as well.\n\n225\n00:13:50.806 --> 00:13:56.620\nAnd the last new feature that I wanted to\ncover here, something called auto-rebuild.\n\n226\n00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.577\nAnd this is pretty cool, too.\n\n227\n00:13:57.577 --> 00:14:01.516\nAnd this is another thing\nthat's happening here behind\n\n228\n00:14:01.516 --> 00:14:06.280\nthe scenes if you have enough\nphysical space available to you.\n\n229\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.893\nSo if we could just go full screen for\na moment so\n\n230\n00:14:08.893 --> 00:14:11.037\nwe can look at this portion over here.\n\n231\n00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:16.440\nSo let's say I had disk 1,\ndisk 2, disk 3 and disk 4.\n\n232\n00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.026\nPerhaps I had a disk failure here for\ndisk 2.\n\n233\n00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:24.700\nWell, if I had specified a hot spare,\nthen all the information, and\n\n234\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.868\nwe'll just say that the red is what is\ncurrently being used on these drives.\n\n235\n00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:35.076\nSo all of this information would\nneed to be rebuilt on my hot spare,\n\n236\n00:14:35.076 --> 00:14:40.939\nwhich could take some time, depending\non how much information was there.\n\n237\n00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:45.148\nHowever, with the advent of auto rebuild,\n\n238\n00:14:45.148 --> 00:14:50.153\nthe information that was\nlost here with the disk 2 is\n\n239\n00:14:50.153 --> 00:14:55.865\nsimultaneously dispersed to disk 1,\ndisk 3 and disk 4.\n\n240\n00:14:55.865 --> 00:14:58.621\nSo you have a faster rebuild time, but\n\n241\n00:14:58.621 --> 00:15:04.062\nthis only happens behind the scenes\nif there is enough available storage.\n\n242\n00:15:04.062 --> 00:15:08.555\nSo that's pretty cool to think about that,\nyeah.\n\n243\n00:15:08.555 --> 00:15:09.871\nAnd I think that's about it for\n\n244\n00:15:09.871 --> 00:15:12.979\nthe new features here.\n&gt;&gt; And now, Cherokee, when you started to\n\n245\n00:15:12.979 --> 00:15:16.650\ntake a look at something like this,\nas we prepare for the exam.\n\n246\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.147\nThis is kind of one of those places where\nit can get you on the exam if you don't\n\n247\n00:15:20.147 --> 00:15:23.936\nknow where those features are located,\nwhether it's 2012 or 2012 R2.\n\n248\n00:15:23.936 --> 00:15:25.868\nSo even though we might be thinking,\n\n249\n00:15:25.868 --> 00:15:28.700\nthey'll never ask a question\nabout the original 2012.\n\n250\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.086\nBut you've got to make sure that you\ndo understand these new features.\n\n251\n00:15:32.086 --> 00:15:35.299\nEspecially that idea of dual parity,\nwhich is kind of neat,\n\n252\n00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:38.150\nthe ability to recover\nfrom two failed drives.\n\n253\n00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.301\nAnd that auto rebuild is actually a neat\nfeature that's only gonna be available\n\n254\n00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:41.826\nin that R2.\n\n255\n00:15:41.826 --> 00:15:44.098\nSo make sure you understand that too,\n\n256\n00:15:44.098 --> 00:15:48.260\nbecause you might see something\nlike that on the exam as well.\n\n257\n00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.146\nAll right, so Cherokee, now that we\nunderstand some of those new features, and\n\n258\n00:15:52.146 --> 00:15:55.689\nwe understand the principle and\nthe purpose behind the reason that you use\n\n259\n00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:58.286\nStorage Spaces what are we\ngoing to take a look at now?\n\n260\n00:15:58.286 --> 00:15:58.928\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n\n261\n00:15:58.928 --> 00:16:02.780\nI think a great place to begin would\nbe taking a look here at my machine and\n\n262\n00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.981\njust diving into the operating system.\n\n263\n00:16:04.981 --> 00:16:07.304\nIf I actually I had it pulled up, but\n\n264\n00:16:07.304 --> 00:16:10.335\nlet me show you how you\nwould access this page.\n\n265\n00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:13.540\nIf you pull up server manager, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.840\nNow, you'll notice on\nthe left hand side over here,\n\n267\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.780\nI have File and Storage services.\n\n268\n00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.380\nI did not install file and\nstorage services.\n\n269\n00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.050\nThat was integrated from\nthe operating system.\n\n270\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:32.540\nSo we'll select this option here and\nzoom out.\n\n271\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.325\nThe first page is going to show the\nservers that I have available to manage\n\n272\n00:16:37.325 --> 00:16:39.528\nhere within our storage spaces.\n\n273\n00:16:39.528 --> 00:16:43.653\nIf I select on storage pools\non the left over here,\n\n274\n00:16:43.653 --> 00:16:48.850\nthis is where I really want to\nconfigure my storage pools.\n\n275\n00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.700\nNow, I'm also able to have\naccess to disk management,\n\n276\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.450\nwhich we saw in private previous episode.\n\n277\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:02.490\nBut, I really would suggest just\nsticking to our server manager,\n\n278\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.580\nand our storage pool interface here,\nfor the majority.\n\n279\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.520\nThere are some smaller features and\ndetails that you\n\n280\n00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.030\ncan manage via desk management,\nbut that's not always the case, so\n\n281\n00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.270\nit's better just to get familiar\nworking in this interphase right here.\n\n282\n00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.872\nSo one thing you'll notice is,\nare there storage space created here,\n\n283\n00:17:21.872 --> 00:17:27.549\nl didn't do anything, the operating system\ncreated this particular storage space for\n\n284\n00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:30.340\nme, and it's called Primordial.\n\n285\n00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.130\nSo primordial just means existing\nfrom the beginning of time.\n\n286\n00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:39.280\nAnd really what we're referencing here\nis the disks that the operating system\n\n287\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.600\ncan recognize,\nthat are physically attached.\n\n288\n00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.990\nAlso I have, if you think back to that\ntriangle that we were just looking at.\n\n289\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:53.310\nOn the bottom of that triangle over here,\nI have my physical disks, okay.\n\n290\n00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.650\nNow, my storage spaces are noted here, and\n\n291\n00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:03.050\nremember how I said that with our storage,\nwe can create virtual disks.\n\n292\n00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.580\nThe terminology is a little funny,\nthey call it storage spaces here, but\n\n293\n00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.790\nin other documentation,\nthey call virtual disk storage spaces, but\n\n294\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.760\njust know that our virtual disks\nare just one level underneath\n\n295\n00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.540\nhow the end users would\nbe accessing that data.\n\n296\n00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:22.310\nWhether it be a volume letter or\nthey see it as a mounted folder there.\n\n297\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.590\nSo this is where that\ninformation would be displayed.\n\n298\n00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.910\nAnd again, you have many\ndifferent ways of creating and\n\n299\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.260\nmanaging these clickable ways\nright here from within the GUI.\n\n300\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.370\nMost often though, you'll be using\nthese drop down tasks action menus.\n\n301\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.390\nSo there's just a couple options there.\n\n302\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:46.760\nOne of the, really, the only functions\nthat I think this primordial\n\n303\n00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.440\npool option is good for here, is to right\nclick and you select new storage pool.\n\n304\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.600\nSo you're taking the disks,\nwhich are right here.\n\n305\n00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.656\nAnd these are the disks that are already,\nthat the operating system sees, and\n\n306\n00:18:59.656 --> 00:19:02.004\nthey're included here in this primordial.\n\n307\n00:19:02.004 --> 00:19:05.247\nSo by right-clicking and\nI select a new storage pool,\n\n308\n00:19:05.247 --> 00:19:08.350\nI can create a pool from\nthat primordial pool.\n\n309\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.870\nSo it'll launch my new storage pool\nwizard, and this is just the welcome page,\n\n310\n00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.649\nI'll hit Next.\n\n311\n00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:20.060\nAnd we'll give it a demo name here of\npool1, and in a production environment,\n\n312\n00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.530\nyou'd wanna include the description,\nI'll hit Next.\n\n313\n00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.380\nI can select the different disks\nthat I have available to me.\n\n314\n00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.530\nI only have three disks on this machine.\n\n315\n00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.350\nThat limits me in a lot of\nconfiguration possibilities,\n\n316\n00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.950\nbecause the operating\nsystem is intuitive enough,\n\n317\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:43.400\nto be able to recognize where I'm\nlacking as far as physical disks.\n\n318\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.290\nSo when I'm running\nthrough these wizards and\n\n319\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.200\nI'm trying to configure this machine and\nconfigure the storage pools,\n\n320\n00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.220\nI'm going to be limited in that capacity,\nby the operating system.\n\n321\n00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.410\nSo whether it be an option\nthat's grayed out, or\n\n322\n00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.750\nthe option has just been omitted and\nyou don't see it brought in.\n\n323\n00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.350\nThe operating system is keeping me honest\nand really keeping me out of trouble,\n\n324\n00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.000\npreventing me from over allocating myself\n\n325\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.560\nwith the available configuration\noptions that I have.\n\n326\n00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.270\nSo from this drop down menu over\nhere on the right hand side,\n\n327\n00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.340\nactually let me zoom in so\nyou guys could see this a little better.\n\n328\n00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.460\nIf you think back to when we\nwere looking at the diagrams,\n\n329\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.640\nI showed you the difference between\nan automatic and manual allocation,\n\n330\n00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.240\nand I noted to only select one.\n\n331\n00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.750\nThis is where you would\nactually select that option.\n\n332\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.530\nNow, if you, so remember,\nautomatic just means, hey,\n\n333\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.200\nwe're gonna let the operating system\nhandle how this disk should behave.\n\n334\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.310\nManual means, I'm going to be in charge or\n\n335\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:50.060\na system admin will be in charge of\nselecting how this disk should behave, and\n\n336\n00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.760\na hot spare means,\nI'm not gonna be using this disk actively.\n\n337\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.710\nIt's gonna be sitting there, waiting for\n\n338\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:02.450\nany kind of physical disk failure to\nreally shine and come into play here.\n\n339\n00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.950\nSo remember, that option where we were\ntalking about the new features there\n\n340\n00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.060\nwith the auto rebuild,\n\n341\n00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.270\nthat's only available if you have\nenough additional free space there.\n\n342\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.730\nSo if you're short on space,\n\n343\n00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:19.300\nyou wanna have that redundancy, hot\nspare is the way to go here, all right.\n\n344\n00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.190\nSo I'm just gonna leave them as\nautomatic right now, and we'll hit Next.\n\n345\n00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:31.340\nThis page is great to just screen shot for\nauditing purposes or\n\n346\n00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.450\neven just network documentation,\nsystem documentation, we'll hit Create.\n\n347\n00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.970\nIt shouldn't take a lot of time here,\nit's pretty fast.\n\n348\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:38.779\nWe'll hit Close.\n\n349\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.710\nAnd, I went fast, but we'll go through\nthis several times and you'll see it.\n\n350\n00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:50.410\nThere was a little tick box to go ahead,\nand launch the creative volume wizard.\n\n351\n00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.410\nSo actually,\nlet's look at disk management and\n\n352\n00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.330\nsee how that appears from within\nthe operating system here.\n\n353\n00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.010\nSo I think I already have that pulled up,\nbut let me just hit Refresh.\n\n354\n00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.120\nNo, it automatically refreshed for\nme here.\n\n355\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.700\nSo disk zero.\n\n356\n00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:13.740\nLet me just hit View here, Action,\nRefresh, just to verify, okay.\n\n357\n00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.230\nSo I don't see those disks that\nI put into that particular pool,\n\n358\n00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.870\nthey've been pulled or\nextracted from disk management here.\n\n359\n00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.290\nSo this is what I was talking about, don't\nrely on disk management to handle that\n\n360\n00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.510\nphysical drives and manage them, because\nsome functions you're not even able too.\n\n361\n00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.717\nAnd it won't be until I actually create\na volume that I'll even see it in disk\n\n362\n00:22:36.717 --> 00:22:37.848\nmanagement there.\n\n363\n00:22:37.848 --> 00:22:40.328\nAnd I won't see it as three\nindividual drives anymore,\n\n364\n00:22:40.328 --> 00:22:42.480\nI'll just see it as that one volume.\n\n365\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.110\nSo let's do that,\nif I can find my machine here.\n\n366\n00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.740\nI just minimized the wrong window,\nthere we go.\n\n367\n00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.970\nOkay, now this is where I would select\nnew virtual disk, so let's go ahead and\n\n368\n00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.390\ncreate a new simple disk here.\n\n369\n00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.380\n[COUGH] Make sure that's\nselected from the drop down menu.\n\n370\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.253\nSelect new virtual disk.\n\n371\n00:23:02.253 --> 00:23:04.720\nAnd this should launch\nthat new volume wizard.\n\n372\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.185\nWhen we're configuring it,\nit should look somewhat familiar to you,\n\n373\n00:23:11.185 --> 00:23:14.127\nbecause we have walked through\nthis process a few times.\n\n374\n00:23:14.127 --> 00:23:19.103\nSo let's just hit Next,\nand I'm selecting where I\n\n375\n00:23:19.103 --> 00:23:24.440\nwant to pull this particular,\ncreate this disk from.\n\n376\n00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.610\nSo I wanna create it from that\npool that we just created.\n\n377\n00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.350\nSo I'll leave that selected pool1,\nand hit Next.\n\n378\n00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.030\nAnd we're gonna name this particular disk.\n\n379\n00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.920\nLet's go ahead and\ncall this one just a simple disk.\n\n380\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.470\nSo if we think about,\nwhen we're creating these disks,\n\n381\n00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.670\nit's almost like when we were running\nthrough that new volume wizard,\n\n382\n00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.070\nand selecting how we want\nthose disks to behave.\n\n383\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:52.380\nSo a simple disk is limited in its use,\n\n384\n00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.390\nsimple disk is similar to striping.\n\n385\n00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:59.086\nSo if we take a look at that,\nand think about grade zeros,\n\n386\n00:23:59.086 --> 00:24:02.024\nthat would be an equivalent\nto a simple disk.\n\n387\n00:24:02.024 --> 00:24:06.424\nSimple disks do not\nprovide any redundancy or\n\n388\n00:24:06.424 --> 00:24:12.341\nfault tolerance,\nsimple disks are really good for videos.\n\n389\n00:24:12.341 --> 00:24:14.557\nSo if you have a lot of videos,\n\n390\n00:24:14.557 --> 00:24:19.459\nwhich there's not a lot of changes\nbeing made to videos usually.\n\n391\n00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:25.095\nAnd videos need to be read\nvery rapidly and fast.\n\n392\n00:24:25.095 --> 00:24:29.735\nSo we do see high performance\nwith simple disks, but\n\n393\n00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:34.035\nit provides no, disks, videos, excuse me.\n\n394\n00:24:34.035 --> 00:24:35.821\nI'm trying to think of a good\nway to explain this here.\n\n395\n00:24:35.821 --> 00:24:40.195\nVideos are easy to back up because\nthey're not being changed often.\n\n396\n00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:42.610\nSo we have that on our side.\n\n397\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.740\nBut if we're working in it frequently,\nas far as any kind of forms or\n\n398\n00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:51.522\ndata that we were managing on a regular\nbasis within a corporate environment,\n\n399\n00:24:51.522 --> 00:24:53.630\nthis would not be a viable option.\n\n400\n00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.656\nThere's no redundancy integrated.\n\n401\n00:24:56.656 --> 00:25:00.869\nAnd there's also another issue with simple\ndisks, that in your configurations, if you\n\n402\n00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:05.000\never wanted to delete that pool you would\nalso have to delete that simple disk.\n\n403\n00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.250\nSo they're really only used for\ntemporary storage or in an environment\n\n404\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.880\nthat it really would benefit like\nsome sort of video storage there.\n\n405\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.590\nSo I'll show you how\nto create one anyways.\n\n406\n00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.536\nWe'll just hit Next and\nleave it as simple, as a matter of fact,\n\n407\n00:25:21.536 --> 00:25:26.232\nyou do have a brief description with\neach one of these configurations here.\n\n408\n00:25:26.232 --> 00:25:30.703\nIt just says, data is striped across\nphysical disks maximizing capacity and\n\n409\n00:25:30.703 --> 00:25:33.810\nincreased throughput but\ndecreasing reliability.\n\n410\n00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.090\nSo this storage layout\nrequires at least one disk and\n\n411\n00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.290\ndoes not protect you from a disk failure.\n\n412\n00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.657\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n413\n00:25:42.657 --> 00:25:47.467\nAnd when we're talking about thin or\nthick provisioning types,\n\n414\n00:25:47.467 --> 00:25:52.633\nthis option is not always going to\nbe available like I was mentioning.\n\n415\n00:25:52.633 --> 00:25:55.735\nSometimes you'll see it grayed out here.\n\n416\n00:25:55.735 --> 00:26:01.001\nSo with thin provisioning,\nI can start small and dynamically expand\n\n417\n00:26:01.001 --> 00:26:06.340\nmy size to appear as if it's growing\nwithin the operating system.\n\n418\n00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.630\nThe reason I would want to do that maybe\nfrom almost like a business perspective,\n\n419\n00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.050\nso I'm not spending more than I need to.\n\n420\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.310\nSo I'm only using what I need.\n\n421\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:21.965\nAnd Ronnie, I don't know if you might\neven have heard this, the more you earn,\n\n422\n00:26:21.965 --> 00:26:23.090\nthe more you spend.\n\n423\n00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.990\nSo with data storage,\nthat same kind of idea is in play here.\n\n424\n00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.678\nThe more you have, the more you use.\n\n425\n00:26:28.678 --> 00:26:34.300\nSo with thin provisioning, a good\nbusiness argument would be to utilize it.\n\n426\n00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.430\nI'm not a huge fan.\n\n427\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:39.621\nI like fixed provisioning types\nbecause it reserves the space on\n\n428\n00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:43.590\nthe hard disk drive and\nyou see that in the operating system.\n\n429\n00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.985\nIt's pretty straightforward,\nthat size is already determined.\n\n430\n00:26:46.985 --> 00:26:51.508\nAnd you can accurately measure and\nplan out and manage your disk management.\n\n431\n00:26:51.508 --> 00:26:54.880\nBut that's gonna be discretionary.\n\n432\n00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.930\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n433\n00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:02.555\nAnd for the size, so we have to keep\nin mind the amount of available\n\n434\n00:27:02.555 --> 00:27:07.583\nsize that we have here and\nwe don't wanna exceed the amount.\n\n435\n00:27:07.583 --> 00:27:10.810\nActually, the operating system won't\nallow us to exceed that amount.\n\n436\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.850\nBut we have 27 gigs available\nto us within pool one.\n\n437\n00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.872\nSo for this particular demonstration,\nlet's just specify.\n\n438\n00:27:19.872 --> 00:27:23.550\nWe'll create a 20 gig drive here.\n\n439\n00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.110\nIf I wanted to utilize that full 27,\n\n440\n00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:30.320\nyou could just hit maximum size and\nnote how it pops to 27 there.\n\n441\n00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.939\nBut we can go back and change it to 20.\n\n442\n00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.190\nAnd this is in gigs.\n\n443\n00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.880\nAnd you have the option if you were\nworking with larger storage increments, or\n\n444\n00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.450\neven smaller as well,\nif you wanted to change that.\n\n445\n00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.793\nI'll hit Next, and then Create.\n\n446\n00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:50.700\nSo this is gonna create a simple disk.\n\n447\n00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.455\nThere are just as many types of\nconfigurations here as there were\n\n448\n00:27:54.455 --> 00:27:57.305\nwith the original RAID configurations,\nas well\n\n449\n00:27:57.305 --> 00:28:01.770\nas when we were looking at those different\nvolume types that we spoke about.\n\n450\n00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:06.190\nSo I want to go through creating those,\nand then we'll also take a look at\n\n451\n00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:11.045\neven some things we could do within\nPowerShell, but Ronnie's looking at me and\n\n452\n00:28:11.045 --> 00:28:14.704\nI think we're out of time.\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, well,\n\n453\n00:28:14.704 --> 00:28:17.890\nthere's a lot more for\nus to actually think about doing here.\n\n454\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.830\nBut Cherokee did show us the idea\nof why we would choose of course,\n\n455\n00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:26.130\nto go with the idea of storage spaces and\nthe elements that are also involved.\n\n456\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.573\nAnd how to begin configuring using,\nwhat is it?\n\n457\n00:28:29.573 --> 00:28:31.620\nFile and Storage Manager?\n\n458\n00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.260\nIs that what it's called?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is gonna be, yes.\n\n459\n00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.530\n&gt;&gt; File and Storage Manager.\n\n460\n00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.570\nSo remember that there's different options\nand you have that available to you.\n\n461\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.944\nCherokee is just showing us also\nhow to create that simple volume or\n\n462\n00:28:42.944 --> 00:28:44.710\nthat simple disk right away.\n\n463\n00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:49.870\nBut there is a lot more for us to do, but\nwe're gonna save that for a part two then.\n\n464\n00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:53.244\nAnd that means we can go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n465\n00:28:53.244 --> 00:28:56.528\nSo for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n466\n00:28:56.528 --> 00:28:57.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

00:00:07.964\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:12.134\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:14.781\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here at of ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:19.390\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n6\n00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.810\nWe're specifically gonna be\naddressing exam 70-410, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.700\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.681\nAnd, here to help us out of course, is\nin our part two on storage spaces is Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:30.690\nCherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.370\nNow Cherokee, in the first episode we did\ntalk a lot about the reasons why we would\n\n11\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.880\nchoose to do it, and we even got\ninto the configuration a little bit.\n\n12\n00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.030\nSo what are we picking up with today,\nCherokee?\n\n13\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.415\n&gt;&gt; So, in the last show we did look\nat how to create a simple disk.\n\n14\n00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.050\nThere are other types of disks to create.\n\n15\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.930\nLike I said, we have parody disks\nwhich mimic rate five or rate six,\n\n16\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.510\nif you're utilizing dual parody.\n\n17\n00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.390\nI think we'll pick up\nby creating a mirror.\n\n18\n00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.906\nA red configuration here, so\nwe'll create a mirror disk.\n\n19\n00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:02.620\nSo if we could take a look at my screen, I\ndon't think we'll create any parody disks.\n\n20\n00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.596\nIt's really simple, and I don't wanna bore\nyou guys with walking through this same\n\n21\n00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:09.580\nprocess, because it really is\npretty similar in that aspect.\n\n22\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.341\nEvery single time,\nyou still come under this tasks menu,\n\n23\n00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:16.880\nselect from the drop down and\nselect new virtual disk.\n\n24\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.725\nAnd again,\nit launches that new virtual disk wizard.\n\n25\n00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:23.054\nWe'll just hit Next here, and\n\n26\n00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:27.750\nI left my pool one available that\nwe were working with before.\n\n27\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.490\nBut i deleted out that simple disk,\njust to give us some space.\n\n28\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.713\nI don't have a ton here,\nso we will hit Next.\n\n29\n00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:42.040\nAnd for the name here, let's go ahead and\ncreate the name mirror disc.\n\n30\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.349\nOops, if I can spell mirror.\n\n31\n00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.498\nAll right, we'll hit.\n\n32\n00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:52.975\nOkay, one thing I do wanna point out,\n\n33\n00:01:52.975 --> 00:01:56.467\nbecause we're going to change\nthis in a few moments.\n\n34\n00:01:56.467 --> 00:02:04.100\nIs that the option here to create storage\ntiers on this virtual disk is grayed out.\n\n35\n00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.530\nIf I zoom out, you can see over here,\nactually I'm gonna go full screen for\n\n36\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.920\none second.\n\n37\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.403\nRight here, under Media Type,\nit says Unknown.\n\n38\n00:02:14.403 --> 00:02:19.440\nSo currently, the Operating System\ndoesn't know what kind of drives I have.\n\n39\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.993\nAnd that is why we are seeing our storage\ntiers grayed out over here on this wizard.\n\n40\n00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:25.270\nWe would have to manually set that.\n\n41\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.270\nStorage tiers can be used with mirroring.\n\n42\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.770\nLike I said,\n\n43\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.980\na lot of these features work together to\nreally bring out the best in all of them.\n\n44\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.597\nSo, when we're creating our mirror drives,\n\n45\n00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:40.493\nit's important to know\nthe fault tolerance rule.\n\n46\n00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.714\nSo let me just pause here for\na second, and\n\n47\n00:02:42.714 --> 00:02:46.510\npull up a link that I have included\nin the show notes, as well.\n\n48\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.590\nIf you're not familiar with\nrate configurations, then\n\n49\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.690\nI would definitely go back and just go to\nthe basics there and understand those.\n\n50\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.140\nIt's gonna make this type of documentation\na lot easier for you to understand.\n\n51\n00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.372\nLet's see, they start even with\nsimple up here at the top, I believe.\n\n52\n00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:10.983\nMaybe not on this page,\nbut other documentation,\n\n53\n00:03:10.983 --> 00:03:14.820\nthey give you kind of like warnings\nhere about things you need to consider.\n\n54\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.030\nSo remember, with our simple that we spoke\nabout before, there was zero redundancy.\n\n55\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.240\nWhen we talk about two way\nmirroring here it says,\n\n56\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.300\nwarning if you have more than two servers,\nwe recommend using three way mirroring.\n\n57\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.090\nAnd that's simply because a two\nway mirror, you have to a minimum\n\n58\n00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.280\ntwo physical drives, but\nit will only tolerate one drive loss.\n\n59\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.740\nNow, with three way mirroring, you have\nto have a minimum of three drives or\n\n60\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.150\nfive drives to tolerate a two drive loss.\n\n61\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.677\nSo, understanding your storage efficiency,\non one hand,\n\n62\n00:03:50.677 --> 00:03:55.736\nversus your resiliency on the other,\nand kind of balance them out to\n\n63\n00:03:55.736 --> 00:04:00.732\nyour organization´s needs,\nis gonna be really important here.\n\n64\n00:04:00.732 --> 00:04:05.222\nBecause, remember,\nwhen I´m implementing two way mirroring,\n\n65\n00:04:05.222 --> 00:04:08.597\nI´m only getting 50% of\nwhat I'm paying for.\n\n66\n00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:13.895\nAs far as disk space, so I get a 50%\nefficiency, storage efficiency there.\n\n67\n00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:17.123\nSo those are just a few things that\nI want you to keep in mind as we're,\n\n68\n00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:20.870\nyou're just clicking through and\nplugging and chugging through the wizards.\n\n69\n00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.990\nBut you really need to understand\nwhat and, what you're clicking in and\n\n70\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.070\nwhy you're clicking it there.\n\n71\n00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.594\nSo, let me just minimize that and\nwe'll continue here.\n\n72\n00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:30.456\nSo, we are going to select,\n\n73\n00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:35.205\nwe're gonna change our lay out type\nbefore we had created a simple disk.\n\n74\n00:04:35.205 --> 00:04:41.755\nWe're gonna create a mirror layout\nhere for this disk, and will hit Next.\n\n75\n00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:45.582\nAnd we'll just keep it here fixed\nprovisioning, we'll hit Next.\n\n76\n00:04:45.582 --> 00:04:52.064\nAnd for our size, we will select,\nI have 20 gigs available.\n\n77\n00:04:52.064 --> 00:04:56.870\nSo let me just create a ten gig\nconfiguration here and hit Next.\n\n78\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.506\nAnd really, that´s it.\n\n79\n00:05:01.506 --> 00:05:08.670\nNow, we can take a look at disk\nmanagement to see how that looks.\n\n80\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.360\nBut remember, I said you would need\nto go ahead and create volumes,\n\n81\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.700\nand format that in order for\nit to display in disk management.\n\n82\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.420\nSo let's do that, let's automatically\ncreate our volumes here.\n\n83\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.356\nSo, we will hit Next And\n\n84\n00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:31.513\nour volume size, let's just take\nfull advantage here and hit Next.\n\n85\n00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:36.906\nI can specify a drive letter, currently,\n\n86\n00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:40.420\nit's just what my system has available,\nDrive E.\n\n87\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.786\nAnd I also have the ability,\njust like we spoke about before,\n\n88\n00:05:43.786 --> 00:05:45.877\nto mount that to a particular folder.\n\n89\n00:05:45.877 --> 00:05:49.500\nWe'll keep the defaults and select Next.\n\n90\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.040\nAnd remember, you can change that at\na later time, if you choose to do so.\n\n91\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.510\nNow, we've also spoken about\nour file system types.\n\n92\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.868\nSo, when we're using storage pools and\nstorage spaces,\n\n93\n00:06:04.868 --> 00:06:10.080\nRAFS really shines in this configuration.\n\n94\n00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.246\nRemember, we're not using this\nstorage space as a bootable drive.\n\n95\n00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:21.530\nSo, to really take advantage, if when I\nhave this mirror configuration set up.\n\n96\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.210\nAnd I'm utilizing an RAF file system,\nthat RAFS\n\n97\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.090\nis going to be able to detect any kind\nof problems within one of those mirrors.\n\n98\n00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.521\nAnd automatically fix it for us.\n\n99\n00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:38.170\nSo I'm gonna select RAFS that would be\nthe, I guess I would say smartest option.\n\n100\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.010\nBut for whatever reason, not everyone\nis going to wanna select that.\n\n101\n00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.830\nFor instance, if you're heavily dependent\non any kind of encryption or compression.\n\n102\n00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.990\nRemember, there are features that\nNTFS offers that RAFS does not.\n\n103\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.330\nSo you'll keep that in mind, as well.\n\n104\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:59.300\nFor our new volume label here, you can put\nwhatever you wanna put ;something logical.\n\n105\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.102\nSo maybe we're use this as sales\ndata as being stored here.\n\n106\n00:07:05.102 --> 00:07:09.580\nSo well just name it sales, and\nthen we can hit Next, and then Create.\n\n107\n00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.490\nIt'll just take a few moments,\nand from here,\n\n108\n00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.310\nwe'll hit Close, and\ntake a look at disk management.\n\n109\n00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.690\nSometimes, it's already propagated here,\nbut\n\n110\n00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.380\nsometimes you'll need to hit refresh\nin order to see that information.\n\n111\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.300\nI can see disk 4 is noted here as my,\nis a little fuzzy.\n\n112\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.390\nBut that's my E drive, and\nI see that it's a healthy partition.\n\n113\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.820\nI can see the space that I have available.\n\n114\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.310\nAnd remember,\nI don't see individual drives,\n\n115\n00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.062\nI just see them together\nhere as one unit of storage.\n\n116\n00:07:48.395 --> 00:07:51.690\nAll right, so,\nworking in the GUI is great.\n\n117\n00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.050\nIt's a great place to start.\n\n118\n00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.221\nSometimes you'll need to use\nPowerShell to execute your functions.\n\n119\n00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:02.557\nSo, specifically, looking at that media\ntype down there and it says, Unknown.\n\n120\n00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:05.290\nWell, there are a few things that\nwe need to do to change that.\n\n121\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:12.460\nBut, first let me pull\nup another link here.\n\n122\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.536\nNow, there are lot of different\ncommandments that you can use for\n\n123\n00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:24.188\ndisc management, volume management,\nstorage space management, there are a ton.\n\n124\n00:08:24.188 --> 00:08:29.350\nI would encourage you to just play\naround and get familiar with some of\n\n125\n00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:35.059\nthe more common ones, creating new\nstorage pulls from within power shell.\n\n126\n00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:39.916\nBut we're going to be creating\ntiered storage within PowerShell.\n\n127\n00:08:39.916 --> 00:08:41.290\nSo let's do that now.\n\n128\n00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.295\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee now that sounds\nlike a great idea getting into PowerShell.\n\n129\n00:08:46.295 --> 00:08:49.471\nBut is there anything that we\nneed to do before we go ahead and\n\n130\n00:08:49.471 --> 00:08:51.380\njump right into the PowerShell?\n\n131\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.701\n&gt;&gt; There are some things a little bit of\nhousekeeping that you might wanna take\n\n132\n00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:55.394\ncare of first.\n\n133\n00:08:55.394 --> 00:09:00.076\nAs a matter fact I just cleaned up that\nstorage pool on that disk by deleting\n\n134\n00:09:00.076 --> 00:09:03.487\nthem, to give our self a nice\nclean fresh start here.\n\n135\n00:09:03.487 --> 00:09:07.570\nIf we take a look at my screen,\nlet me minimize PowerShell.\n\n136\n00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.410\nAnd you can see even here,\nyou can specify additional\n\n137\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:18.220\nparameters to really get the most\nbenefit from your hardware here.\n\n138\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.396\nSo natively I can see\nthe bus that's being used for\n\n139\n00:09:21.396 --> 00:09:24.278\nthe type of disks that I have and\nmy capacity.\n\n140\n00:09:24.278 --> 00:09:26.530\nBut I really don't see too much else.\n\n141\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:32.715\nI mean, I specified this earlier,\nmy Media Type as being unknown.\n\n142\n00:09:32.715 --> 00:09:34.930\nNow my Chassis and my RPM.\n\n143\n00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:39.562\nNow thinking back to utilizing\nour SCSI enclosure services,\n\n144\n00:09:39.562 --> 00:09:43.838\nwhich is actually a protocol\nthat Microsoft supports for\n\n145\n00:09:43.838 --> 00:09:46.784\nthose disk enclosures, you can have.\n\n146\n00:09:46.784 --> 00:09:48.674\nLike I said even before,\n\n147\n00:09:48.674 --> 00:09:53.620\nreally cool details about those\ndiscs being reported to the OS.\n\n148\n00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.025\nEven like temperature of those discs for\nreal granular measurement but or\n\n149\n00:09:58.025 --> 00:09:58.955\nmaintenance.\n\n150\n00:09:58.955 --> 00:10:03.220\nBut what I want to focus\non was that media type.\n\n151\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:11.340\nAnd this is something that needs to be\nchanged before using storage tiers.\n\n152\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.324\nNow let me rephrase that,\nit doesn't always need to be changed.\n\n153\n00:10:15.324 --> 00:10:20.125\nIf the system is able to recognize it\nnatively, then it will display here and\n\n154\n00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:22.790\nyou won't need to change it.\n\n155\n00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.430\nIn our situation it does not so\nwe will need to change it.\n\n156\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.009\nSo let's go back into PowerShell and\ndo that manually.\n\n157\n00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:35.178\nOkay, the first command we will be\nusing is going to be git-physicaldis,\n\n158\n00:10:35.178 --> 00:10:37.650\nif I'm typing here which I'm not.\n\n159\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:43.650\nLet me just click make sure,\nI'm in this right interface,\n\n160\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.856\nGet- PhysicalDisk, we will hit enter.\n\n161\n00:10:49.028 --> 00:10:49.810\n&gt;&gt; You misspelled.\n\n162\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.090\n&gt;&gt; I sure did, didn't I?\n\n163\n00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.534\nAlright, there we go.\n\n164\n00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:55.940\nGive it a second.\n\n165\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:01.080\nNow we can see the different disks that\nare available in my system for use.\n\n166\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.690\nSo this category right\nhere it says can pool.\n\n167\n00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.328\nAnd physical disk zero is the disk\nthat currently is harboring\n\n168\n00:11:10.328 --> 00:11:12.121\nthe operating system.\n\n169\n00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:14.570\nThat's my boot disk and it says false.\n\n170\n00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.992\nSo we're not able to add that to a pool.\n\n171\n00:11:15.992 --> 00:11:20.410\nSo I currently have three disks\navailable to work with here.\n\n172\n00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.092\nI've got disk three,\ndisk one and disk two.\n\n173\n00:11:23.092 --> 00:11:26.360\nI can see the health\nstatus here is healthy.\n\n174\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.062\nAnd it's important also to just kind of\nkeep in mind about that size as well.\n\n175\n00:11:32.062 --> 00:11:35.404\nThe next command I'm gonna do,\nI'm building,\n\n176\n00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:39.325\nwhen we're talking about\nstorage pools in PowerShell.\n\n177\n00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:43.346\nIt's pretty amazing the things\nthat you can do because,\n\n178\n00:11:43.346 --> 00:11:47.100\non a small level,\nit's great, it's helpful.\n\n179\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:53.891\nBut when we're talking Data Center it is\nextremely helpful and extremely powerful.\n\n180\n00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:58.552\nWhen you're dealing, if your job\nis data storage and management or\n\n181\n00:11:58.552 --> 00:12:05.185\ndata retention management, you're dealing\ntypically with a large number of disks.\n\n182\n00:12:05.185 --> 00:12:06.764\nFiltering and sifting through that.\n\n183\n00:12:06.764 --> 00:12:11.795\nSo you're usually building,\nyou're not using little cmdlets at a time.\n\n184\n00:12:11.795 --> 00:12:16.184\nYou're usually scripting, utilizing\nPowerShell isc or ISC, creating a whole\n\n185\n00:12:16.184 --> 00:12:20.394\nlist of scripting and kind of building\nfrom that to tailor your environment.\n\n186\n00:12:20.394 --> 00:12:23.670\nAnd it´s really pretty awesome\nwhen you think about that.\n\n187\n00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.464\nBut we´re just going to go\nthrough the building here and\n\n188\n00:12:26.464 --> 00:12:30.790\nshow you how you can take the commands and\nthen pipe them into something else.\n\n189\n00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.098\nSo now that I have those physical disks,\nI´ll hit my up arrow.\n\n190\n00:12:34.098 --> 00:12:37.791\nAnd then I'll pipe that\ninto my next command here.\n\n191\n00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:41.460\nAnd I'm gonna say where friendly name.\n\n192\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.597\nAnd Ronny I'm not sure\nif I'm typing correctly.\n\n193\n00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.727\nNope.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n194\n00:12:45.727 --> 00:12:46.315\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n195\n00:12:49.511 --> 00:12:51.211\nWhere friendly name.\n\n196\n00:12:51.211 --> 00:12:56.159\nAnd then we'll add this parameter\nis going to be physical disc.\n\n197\n00:12:59.517 --> 00:13:02.720\nAnd it's important here, no space.\n\n198\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.600\nYou create the square bracket, and\nbecause when we were working in disk\n\n199\n00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.570\npart, we saw those identifiers being\nutilized by numerical fashion.\n\n200\n00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.038\nNow the syntax in PowerShell's a little\ndifferent, you can Invoke that disk by\n\n201\n00:13:19.038 --> 00:13:22.322\nthe friendly name and\nthere are other parameters as well.\n\n202\n00:13:22.322 --> 00:13:25.341\nWe're gonna be using that\nfriendly name here so\n\n203\n00:13:25.341 --> 00:13:29.260\nwe're going to say physical disks and\nwhat are our sizes.\n\n204\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:35.741\nWe've got disk three is 20 gigs and\nthen disk one is 10 and disk two is 15.\n\n205\n00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.370\nSo lets just put one and two together.\n\n206\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.932\nSo we'll say disks one through two.\n\n207\n00:13:40.932 --> 00:13:45.274\nEnd the brackets, not curly bracket,\njust square bracket.\n\n208\n00:13:45.274 --> 00:13:50.980\nSo it should just be pulling those\ntwo disks, one and two, okay?\n\n209\n00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.578\nAnd it did, so that's good.\n\n210\n00:13:52.578 --> 00:13:57.315\nNow what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna kind of cheat and lie here.\n\n211\n00:13:57.315 --> 00:13:59.519\nI wouldn't do this in a real environment,\nbut I wanna show you.\n\n212\n00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:02.005\nIf we can full screen for\na moment so that.\n\n213\n00:14:02.005 --> 00:14:07.101\nOkay, so FYI I did recreate a pool after\nI had deleted the one from previously.\n\n214\n00:14:07.101 --> 00:14:11.840\nYou will need to have a pool to pull from\nto work with these physical disks here.\n\n215\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:20.844\nIf I take those two previous commands,\nthen I can also pipe this information out.\n\n216\n00:14:20.844 --> 00:14:26.440\nAnd I can kind of lie to the operating\nsystem here for demonstration purposes.\n\n217\n00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.693\nI wouldn't really lie to the operating\nsystem and tell it that I was using\n\n218\n00:14:30.693 --> 00:14:34.474\na solid state drive versus a hard\ndisk drive if I really wasn't.\n\n219\n00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:38.930\nBecause then that would defeat the purpose\nof me benefiting from storage tiers.\n\n220\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.782\nSo if I had a mixed environment\nof different types of disks,\n\n221\n00:14:42.782 --> 00:14:45.255\nthis is where I'd really be using it.\n\n222\n00:14:45.255 --> 00:14:50.906\nSo I'm gonna use the pipe command and\n\n223\n00:14:50.906 --> 00:14:57.850\nI'm going to use the set\ndash physical disk.\n\n224\n00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:03.310\nAlright, physical disk and\nthen space dash, media type.\n\n225\n00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.712\nThis is where I specify\nif it's going to be here.\n\n226\n00:15:08.712 --> 00:15:12.620\nI'm gonna say hard disk drive,\nand we'll hit enter.\n\n227\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.602\nAnd not a whole lot happens here.\n\n228\n00:15:15.602 --> 00:15:20.724\nYou're like I don't know if it worked to,\nif you minimize that, let me just hit,\n\n229\n00:15:20.724 --> 00:15:24.830\nthis is that pool that I was telling\nyou we were working with here.\n\n230\n00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.790\nAnd scroll down, and zoom out.\n\n231\n00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:30.921\nI was zoomed in, then it looks like.\n\n232\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:38.623\nLet me keep going.\n\n233\n00:15:38.623 --> 00:15:39.269\nGive me one second.\n\n234\n00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:42.477\nIt's like kind of cutting off on\nthe scroll where I want to Show you,\n\n235\n00:15:42.477 --> 00:15:43.750\nthere it is.\n\n236\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:49.070\nLet me hit refresh here to see if it\ncan now recognize the media type for\n\n237\n00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.474\nthese two discs, and it does.\n\n238\n00:15:51.474 --> 00:15:56.472\nAnd you can see that this media type\nnow is recognized at a hard disc drive.\n\n239\n00:15:56.472 --> 00:15:58.952\nSo it's saying, hey,\nthose are the optical or spindle drives.\n\n240\n00:15:58.952 --> 00:16:01.510\nBut we're not finished yet.\nWe have to have a mixture of different\n\n241\n00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.100\ntypes of drives in our environment.\n\n242\n00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.684\nTo use to take advantage of storage tiers.\n\n243\n00:16:06.684 --> 00:16:10.892\nSo let's go back into PowerShell and\nspecify our, so\n\n244\n00:16:10.892 --> 00:16:15.952\nthat was disks one and two, so\nwe need to specify for disk three.\n\n245\n00:16:15.952 --> 00:16:22.042\nSo I'll just hit the up arrow and we can\nkind of modify the previous syntax here.\n\n246\n00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:27.148\nSo let's change this to Solid state drive,\n\n247\n00:16:27.148 --> 00:16:34.890\nand it's kind of quirky in the way\nthat you specify the discs here.\n\n248\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.585\nSo I'm gonna put 3-3.\n\n249\n00:16:37.585 --> 00:16:45.709\nSo 3 through 3, but it will recognize\nit just there as disc three here.\n\n250\n00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:46.278\nAnd we'll hit Enter.\n\n251\n00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:53.881\nAnd again, no glaring remarks,\nso let's come back into\n\n252\n00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:58.714\nServer Manager, hit Refresh,\nand see what happens.\n\n253\n00:16:58.714 --> 00:17:03.810\nFrom here we should be able to\ncreate our new virtual disk,\n\n254\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.699\nand that's where we'll see\nthat storage tier option.\n\n255\n00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:12.066\nSo it looks like we're good to\ngo here with that medium type.\n\n256\n00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:15.429\nThe system did recognize\nthat as solid state.\n\n257\n00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:20.450\nSo let's begin our\nvirtual disk option here,\n\n258\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:26.896\nselect new virtual disk, We'll hit Next,\n\n259\n00:17:26.896 --> 00:17:32.901\nwe're gonna be using our pool 2,\nthat new one that I had created,\n\n260\n00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:39.793\nand let's say tiered, For\nour tiered disk here.\n\n261\n00:17:39.793 --> 00:17:44.694\nAnd this is really what it boils down\nto is this little tick mark right here.\n\n262\n00:17:44.694 --> 00:17:48.223\nIt says Create tiers on this virtual disk.\n\n263\n00:17:48.223 --> 00:17:49.980\nSo let's make sure we select that.\n\n264\n00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.448\nThat was the whole point of this.\n\n265\n00:17:52.448 --> 00:17:54.583\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n266\n00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:58.782\nAnd we could use the simple disk but\nwe might wanna use mirroring.\n\n267\n00:17:58.782 --> 00:18:00.482\nAnd we'll hit Next.\n\n268\n00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:04.753\nAnd also, like I said,\nthe operating system will remind you,\n\n269\n00:18:04.753 --> 00:18:07.896\nthat's just something\nI forgot about there,\n\n270\n00:18:07.896 --> 00:18:12.425\nif you don't have enough physical\ndisks for that configuration.\n\n271\n00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:15.468\nBut we'll just leave it as simple,\nwe'll hit Next.\n\n272\n00:18:15.468 --> 00:18:20.212\nAnd another thing that the operating\nsystem is helping me out with here is\n\n273\n00:18:20.212 --> 00:18:22.859\nselecting fixed provisioning types for\n\n274\n00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:26.224\nus because we cannot use\na thin provisioning type.\n\n275\n00:18:26.224 --> 00:18:31.380\nWhenever we are utilizing storage tier,\nso that's something to consider as well.\n\n276\n00:18:34.018 --> 00:18:36.204\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n277\n00:18:36.204 --> 00:18:37.546\nAnd this is really interesting, too.\n\n278\n00:18:37.546 --> 00:18:42.520\nSo the operating system\nconcatenates that storage space and\n\n279\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.721\nthen relies on you to\nspecify how to allocate that.\n\n280\n00:18:46.721 --> 00:18:51.060\nSo in the diagram that I had showed you\nbefore where we're talking about our gold\n\n281\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.484\ntier and our silver tier,\n\n282\n00:18:52.484 --> 00:18:55.998\nyou can call them whatever you\nwant when you're creating them.\n\n283\n00:18:55.998 --> 00:18:59.647\nBut you have your faster tier\nwhich will be like the gold tier,\n\n284\n00:18:59.647 --> 00:19:03.308\nyour standard tier which would\nbe like your silver tier here.\n\n285\n00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:08.582\nSo you can specify the sizes here and\nhow you want that to be allocated.\n\n286\n00:19:08.582 --> 00:19:12.294\nAre you performing a lot of\nquick reads and writes or\n\n287\n00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:17.050\nis the information where you need\nmore long-term storage data?\n\n288\n00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.852\nAnd that's kind of what you\nwould be thinking about here.\n\n289\n00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:25.543\nSo the amount of free space in our\nparticular setup here is 36 gigs and\n\n290\n00:19:25.543 --> 00:19:28.442\nso you'd want to think about that.\n\n291\n00:19:28.442 --> 00:19:33.399\nI could say hey, maybe I'll put ten\ngigs here for my faster space, and\n\n292\n00:19:33.399 --> 00:19:37.096\nthen the remaining 18 gigs\nI could put right here,\n\n293\n00:19:37.096 --> 00:19:41.993\nor just hit that Maximize size and\nit will fill in the 18 gigs for me.\n\n294\n00:19:41.993 --> 00:19:44.231\nAnd then Next.\n\n295\n00:19:44.231 --> 00:19:48.452\nThis is just that overall Summary page,\nwe'll hit Create.\n\n296\n00:19:48.452 --> 00:19:50.330\nAnd it's really quick,\n\n297\n00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:55.167\nand it'll launch that Create\na volume when this wizard closes.\n\n298\n00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:56.623\nWe don't have to do that,\n\n299\n00:19:56.623 --> 00:20:00.284\nI just wanted to show you how we\nwould specify that in PowerShell.\n\n300\n00:20:00.284 --> 00:20:06.214\nIt's pretty quick and easy and\nthat storage pools in a nutshell.\n\n301\n00:20:06.214 --> 00:20:10.822\nI know there's a lot to think about when\ntalking with, talking about storage but\n\n302\n00:20:10.822 --> 00:20:14.077\nhopefully that gives you\na pretty good understanding and\n\n303\n00:20:14.077 --> 00:20:17.833\nthen enough confidence to get in there and\nplay around yourself.\n\n304\n00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:21.328\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, thank you again for\nhelping us out here as we\n\n305\n00:20:21.328 --> 00:20:24.760\ntake a look at more configurations\nof these storage pools, and\n\n306\n00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.043\neven the idea on use of the storage tiers.\n\n307\n00:20:27.043 --> 00:20:30.081\nIt's neat for us to be able to mix and\nmatch the solid states and\n\n308\n00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:33.942\nof course our conventional drives, and\nstill be able to take advantage of both\n\n309\n00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:37.765\ninstead of what normally happens when\nwe mix a bunch of hard drives together.\n\n310\n00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:40.675\nIt's that they all function at\nwhatever the slowest speed is.\n\n311\n00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:44.241\nStorage spaces or storage chairs really\nseem to help us out in this instance.\n\n312\n00:20:44.241 --> 00:20:45.848\nThere is a lot more for us to cover.\n\n313\n00:20:45.848 --> 00:20:48.521\nNow Cherokee,\nanything else that we need to think about?\n\n314\n00:20:48.521 --> 00:20:51.978\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, you brought up some great\npoints there because traditionally with\n\n315\n00:20:51.978 --> 00:20:54.626\nour raid configurations we\nreally had to be structured and\n\n316\n00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:57.884\nformal thinking about hey,\nwho's the manufacturer of these drives?\n\n317\n00:20:57.884 --> 00:21:00.813\nWhat´s the rpm,\nare they all the same size?\n\n318\n00:21:00.813 --> 00:21:03.784\nHere with storage pools,\nwe have that flexibility,\n\n319\n00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:05.904\nwe have that ability to mix and match.\n\n320\n00:21:05.904 --> 00:21:10.898\nSo we´re taking and making best use\nof what we already have to work with.\n\n321\n00:21:10.898 --> 00:21:11.607\nSo that´s pretty cool.\n\n322\n00:21:11.607 --> 00:21:12.373\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n323\n00:21:12.373 --> 00:21:14.893\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also sign off for this episode.\n\n324\n00:21:14.893 --> 00:21:18.740\nFor ITProTV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n325\n00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.002\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

00:00:06.263\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.263 --> 00:00:08.190\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.898\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:15.137\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to\nMicrosoft Server 70-410 series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:17.820\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.510\nIn this episode,\nwe have a special treat for you.\n\n9\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.340\nToday, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.840\nAnd, we'll be taking a look at something\ncalled Desired State Configuration.\n\n11\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.200\nHow's it going today Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.870\n&gt;&gt; It is going well today,\nas we continue on in our MCSA 70-410 show.\n\n13\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.590\nWe wanted to make sure that\nas we came to this part and\n\n14\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.210\ntalked about desired state configuration\nthat you understand what it really is.\n\n15\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.410\nAnd of course for the objectives they do\ncall out installing and configuring it.\n\n16\n00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.285\nSo we'll make sure that we do both,\n\n17\n00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:53.165\nis what we're actually make\nsure that we end up doing.\n\n18\n00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:56.290\nSo that you understand how\nto also get this done too.\n\n19\n00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.880\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie we've already looked\nat how we could install and\n\n20\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.950\nconfigure Server 20 and, 2012 and 2012 R2,\nin both the GUI and the core, but when\n\n21\n00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.530\nwe're talking about these installations\nwhat are some challenges that we may face.\n\n22\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to, especially\non the installation and configuration,\n\n23\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.750\nright, for a small organization, probably\nnot as many challenges as we think.\n\n24\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.030\nOne, there's not gonna be that\nmany different servers out there.\n\n25\n00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.890\nAnd even if we're virtualized,\nwe probably aren't gonna have but\n\n26\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.490\na handful of servers.\n\n27\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.650\nSo the great thing is,\ncontrol is relatively easy.\n\n28\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.340\n&gt;&gt; But as the number of your IT pros and\n\n29\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.190\nteams are coming together, it could\nbe that it gets assigned to somebody\n\n30\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.920\nbesides you and now all of a sudden\nthe installation when you go hey,\n\n31\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.320\nlet's go ahead and install another\ninstance of server inside of a VM.\n\n32\n00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.970\nWell, that could mean anything to anybody.\n\n33\n00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.350\nAny particular person might go, all right,\nwell, let's go ahead and install this, and\n\n34\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.960\nso here it is, Cherokee.\n\n35\n00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.840\nYou and I are working together\nwith somebody else, and\n\n36\n00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.500\nnow what ends up happening is that we say,\nall right, go ahead and\n\n37\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.810\ninstall that version of, or\njust server, into a v out.\n\n38\n00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.007\nAnd we come back and we are ready to\nget started with the configuration, and\n\n39\n00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:19.005\nall of a sudden we realize something,\nit's Server 2016 and you're saying Ronnie,\n\n40\n00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:22.689\nyou're talking about this serve 2012,\nand 70-410.\n\n41\n00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.318\nExactly, that's the problem, right, when\nin my organization is still build around,\n\n42\n00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:33.072\nand the solid infrastructure is\nServer 2012 but we've been testing.\n\n43\n00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:37.510\nWe've been just trying to see if\nwe want to migrate over to 2016.\n\n44\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.611\nAnd now instead of us actually being\nable to use that in production that VM\n\n45\n00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:44.903\nright way, we now have one of us,\nat least has to go back and\n\n46\n00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:49.230\ndo what the wrong installation, and\nwe've just got to reinstall it again.\n\n47\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe they grabbed the wrong\nISO file or something like that.\n\n48\n00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.425\nI mean I've seen it all the time,\nso it could happen.\n\n49\n00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:59.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah no, even the ISO names\nright, you can get from Microsoft itself,\n\n50\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.680\nespecially if you're downloading\nthe ISO from one of their sites.\n\n51\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.670\nIt's not the easiest one to actually kind\nof parse through as far as the names go.\n\n52\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.200\nThey're like 60 characters long,\nand so even though 2016 and\n\n53\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.540\n2012 might seem obvious, along with a\nstring of characters, the only thing that\n\n54\n00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.630\nthey're probably looking for is what\nwe said, install server, and they just\n\n55\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.950\npicked whatever one that they actually\nthink is better for us to install.\n\n56\n00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.380\nSo just even on the installation point,\nokay, it could be something like that.\n\n57\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.820\nNow, what if we take that\na little bit further?\n\n58\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.360\nWhat if we do get the right version and\nthen we say all right, let's go ahead and\n\n59\n00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.400\nmake sure that we install this and\n\n60\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.680\nthat we configure these things, even\nthe initial conjuration can be different.\n\n61\n00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.500\nSo let's just take for an example\nbetween you and me Cherokee, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.460\nWe both learned a little bit at different\ntimes on how things actually end up\n\n63\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.500\nworking so it could be that\nwhat ends up going when I say,\n\n64\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.390\nhey let's install this, and\nmake sure that it functions this way.\n\n65\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.190\nWell, Cherokee that means I can\ninstall it in one way because\n\n66\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.040\nthat's the order that I figured out how\nto actually make it work and learn it.\n\n67\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.450\nBut Cherokee you actually had a different\nprofessional background than I did.\n\n68\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.570\nAnd your way might have actually,\neven though it's just as effective,\n\n69\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.190\nmight be different and all of a sudden,\nI'm expecting one result and\n\n70\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.940\nyou're expecting another one\nwhen the end of it comes out.\n\n71\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.950\nAnd now, here it is, I'm trying to\ngo why isn't it working this way?\n\n72\n00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.750\nAnd you're telling me, no, I tested out,\n\n73\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.054\neverything that I saw as a test,\nmakes it work.\n\n74\n00:04:24.054 --> 00:04:25.879\nEverything's good.\n\n75\n00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:31.020\nSo even an initial configurations\nat times, in the installation as we\n\n76\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.817\nget started here and get everything up and\nrunning,, we might find out even just kind\n\n77\n00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:41.560\nof the variable nature and the path or\nthe order that we choose to do things in,\n\n78\n00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.470\nmight not actually give us\nthe results that we want it to.\n\n79\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.080\nSo in that instance we do\nhave some issues with that.\n\n80\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.920\nOr, if we assigned it to somebody that\ndoesn't have as much experience as you and\n\n81\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.230\nI, and they just don't know if\nthey've completed the installation and\n\n82\n00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.640\nthe configurations that we need.\n\n83\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.390\nSo we could end up with incomplete or\nincorrect configurations,\n\n84\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.220\nwe can end up with inconsistencies and\nthe two of us just doing things.\n\n85\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.050\nAnd this has happened to me before where\none of the standard ways that I've,\n\n86\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.240\nlet's just say, set up a server, right?\n\n87\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.040\nIs I ordered a couple of servers\nfrom Dell years ago, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.710\nAnd we were doing this for\nterminal severs.\n\n89\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.790\nWe wanted two matching servers, and\nwe got the performance that we wanted.\n\n90\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.520\nWe got the RAM that we wanted.\n\n91\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.200\nAnd I went ahead and I said hey, I'm gonna\nassign this to somebody else to go ahead\n\n92\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.980\nand install Windows Server 2012 on it.\n\n93\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.879\nAnd we'll be up and ready to go, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.760\nWell, to me it was simple.\n\n95\n00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.200\nThe way that I always did it\nis I blow away the hard drive.\n\n96\n00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.197\nCompletely free and clean,\nnothing on it, right?\n\n97\n00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:46.522\nSo blow away every partition and\nI reinstall server on it..\n\n98\n00:05:46.522 --> 00:05:50.512\nBut when I assigned it to somebody,\nthey were not as willing to\n\n99\n00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:54.990\nblow away everything just in\ncase they messed up something.\n\n100\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.450\nAnd so when we got it up and\nrunning we started experiencing unusual\n\n101\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.150\ninconsistencies on certain things,\nand we weren't sure why.\n\n102\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.090\nWhy it wasn't actually performing\nin the way that it happened, so\n\n103\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.740\nwe had to go back and do what.\n\n104\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.420\nNow we had to go back and\nreinstall it, blow away everything,\n\n105\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.920\nstart all over again and do what we\nwanted to do in the way that we wanted.\n\n106\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.820\nSo in that sense,\n\n107\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.100\nall these things kind of add up to\nlittle things that are small misses.\n\n108\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.603\nBut it's just like everything\nelse in this world, right?\n\n109\n00:06:23.603 --> 00:06:29.119\nA small little type of inconsistency or\nincorrect configuration, or\n\n110\n00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:36.360\njust not having the time and slowing down\nat the beginning to figure something out.\n\n111\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.720\nIt starts piling up and in this world,\n\n112\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.870\nin terms of minutes right,\nminutes turn into hours very quickly.\n\n113\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.820\n&gt;&gt; I think it's really important to point\nout that, I know we've mentioned here\n\n114\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.100\non this ITProTV in previous episodes,\nso I'll just throw it out there as well.\n\n115\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.810\nIt's very important to keep good\ndocumentation of your network, and\n\n116\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.610\nalso not only come up with policies,\nbut to enforce them as well.\n\n117\n00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.510\nSo, if you have a particular installation\nmethod, like Ronnie was referencing,\n\n118\n00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.250\nenforcing those is essential because,\nyou probably, if you already don't know,\n\n119\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.675\nyou will find that in the business world,\npeople tend to have their own\n\n120\n00:07:16.675 --> 00:07:21.490\nidiosyncrasies or they have their own\nstyles or flairs on how to do something.\n\n121\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.180\nBut that may not be the way that\nyour organization has intended for\n\n122\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.980\nthose machines to get rolled out.\n\n123\n00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.320\nSo you do wanna make sure\nthat people are aware of and\n\n124\n00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.690\nare using the policies that your company\nmay have spent a lot of time preparing.\n\n125\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.310\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's no doubt that\nwhen you actually just think about\n\n126\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.010\nthese things, right?\n\n127\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.210\nEach one of those can lead\nto something that we're\n\n128\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.910\nnot expecting the exact result from,\nright?\n\n129\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.763\nSo we don't get the right return, we don't\nget what we expected, period, at all.\n\n130\n00:07:50.763 --> 00:07:55.477\nOr, it adds up into being more time that\nwe end up wasting trying to figure out\n\n131\n00:07:55.477 --> 00:08:00.207\nwhat ended up happening, rather than\nbeing able to get done when we need to.\n\n132\n00:08:00.207 --> 00:08:05.090\nNow, that challenge, though, that we're\ntalking about extends not only in just\n\n133\n00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.900\nthe initial install, but even into\nthe realm of maintenance too, right?\n\n134\n00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.370\nSo, Cherokee, have you heard of\nthe term configuration drift before?\n\n135\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.780\n&gt;&gt; So not only have I heard of it, but\nI've had to deal with it before, and\n\n136\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.770\nit's a real thing.\n\n137\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.029\nSo, yeah,\nI don't know if you want to explain it or\n\n138\n00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:24.060\nif you just want to kind\nof talk about it here?\n\n139\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee, why don't you\ngive us your experience about it and\n\n140\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.635\nwe'll see what we can\nfill in if we need to.\n\n141\n00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:29.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n142\n00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.974\nSo in my experience,\n\n143\n00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:35.172\nI've entered situations where\nAdmins always haven't been,\n\n144\n00:08:35.172 --> 00:08:41.205\nmaybe it's because they're busy, maybe\nit's because they feel they're overworked.\n\n145\n00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:44.669\nI don't know what the reason is,\nbut sometimes they'll\n\n146\n00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:48.784\ngive out administrative credentials\nto allow others to go ahead and\n\n147\n00:08:48.784 --> 00:08:54.000\nmodify their systems in ways that deviate\nfrom those policies that I just mentioned.\n\n148\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.660\nWhy?\n\n149\n00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.375\nWell, usually because it\nis the easy thing to do.\n\n150\n00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:02.410\nAnd so\ninstead of having a standardization and\n\n151\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.000\na uniform PDF reader that everyone\nin your organization uses,\n\n152\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.110\nyou have five different versions\nrunning in one particular office.\n\n153\n00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.050\nAnd it might not seem like a big deal, but\nwhen you start to add additional variables\n\n154\n00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.490\nand random pieces of software,\nit makes troubleshooting more difficult.\n\n155\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.380\nSo that's why it's really important to\nkeep everyone on the same page here.\n\n156\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.080\nAnd that's,\nthat was my experience with it.\n\n157\n00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.970\nIt's just that people, if you allow them\nto, they will be adding all sorts of\n\n158\n00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:32.710\nrandom little games, and\neven like blinking cursors, and\n\n159\n00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.498\njust really weird strange things that you\nshouldn't see in a production environment.\n\n160\n00:09:36.498 --> 00:09:39.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's not doubt\nthat at the end user side,\n\n161\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.940\nit makes it makes it very difficult\nto keep a standardized base, or\n\n162\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.480\na standard based type of installation\nthroughout your network, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.340\nAnd people might be wondering\nwhy is that important?\n\n164\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.020\nIf this is your first time in server and\ntalking about system administration, well,\n\n165\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.790\nit's important because when we set up\nan image, right, we want to troubleshoot.\n\n166\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.570\nAnd we know the ins and\nouts of that image.\n\n167\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.840\nWhat's on that image, what's configured,\nwhat isn't configured\n\n168\n00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.670\nThat gives us the ability to come in and\ntroubleshoot a machine and\n\n169\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.120\ngo, hey, that shouldn't be on so\nlet's make sure we turn it back off.\n\n170\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.840\nWe go in and we're able to say that\napplication shouldn't be there.\n\n171\n00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.460\nAnd they go, well, how do you know?\n\n172\n00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.160\nIt's because I built the image, that's\nhow I know that that shouldn't be there.\n\n173\n00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.480\nAnd when stuff like that happens\nit makes it very easy to identify.\n\n174\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.690\nWith that, and\n\n175\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.520\nthe end-user being able to change things\nthe way they want, not great at all.\n\n176\n00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.760\nBut when it comes down to\nthe server level though,\n\n177\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.150\nimagine these are shared resources.\n\n178\n00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.500\nIn other words,\nyour entire company or department or\n\n179\n00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.640\nteam, whatever it is,\nthey may depend on this type of server.\n\n180\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.480\nAnd if you do the same thing that Cherokee\nwas talking about, all the sudden,\n\n181\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.975\nlets take for\nan example a web server, right?\n\n182\n00:10:51.975 --> 00:10:56.360\nLet's say in our small little IT\ndepartment here, Cherokee, you and I,\n\n183\n00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.010\nwe set up a web server.\n\n184\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.034\nAnd we know that it's gonna be for,\nlets just say it's gonna be for\n\n185\n00:11:01.034 --> 00:11:02.860\nan intranet web server.\n\n186\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.940\nWell, I think of an intranet web server,\nI know what I visualize in my head.\n\n187\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.390\nCherokee, you think of an intranet server,\nand\n\n188\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.970\nyou visualize what you think is\nactually gonna be in your head.\n\n189\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.150\nAnd all of the sudden the other\npeople start going, yeah,\n\n190\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.555\nlet's say everybody is going\nto have access to this.\n\n191\n00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:22.860\nWell, when they start doing that, and\nall of a sudden they realize something.\n\n192\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.540\nAt this point we're going to configure\nthe web server to look like what?\n\n193\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.270\nWhat's right here in my head.\n\n194\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.200\nWhat's right there in Cherokee's head.\n\n195\n00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.230\nAnd now, the configuration begins\nto change very easily and quickly.\n\n196\n00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:39.499\nAll the sudden on that web server, not\nonly it is just a web server anymore for\n\n197\n00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.771\nsomething like an intranet site,\nor even a [CROSSTALK]\n\n198\n00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:42.344\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n199\n00:11:42.344 --> 00:11:44.936\nin my head I'm thinking like an HR portal.\n\n200\n00:11:44.936 --> 00:11:48.146\nLike I'm going to put all\nsorts of insurance forms and\n\n201\n00:11:48.146 --> 00:11:50.012\nPTO request forms available.\n\n202\n00:11:50.012 --> 00:11:53.394\nMaybe for\nthe employees to go ahead and access.\n\n203\n00:11:53.394 --> 00:11:56.790\nAnd then Ronnie can have a completely\ndifferent concept or idea.\n\n204\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, just think about this.\n\n205\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.640\nAll of a sudden you, or like me,\n\n206\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.930\nI'll go why is there an SMB\nshare on this web server now?\n\n207\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.320\nI didn't say you should be\nable to put an SMB share.\n\n208\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.520\nWhy all of a sudden does Cherokee\nhave her own personal folder\n\n209\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.930\nsitting right there on that?\n\n210\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.690\nI don't understand what is going on.\n\n211\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.440\nWhat is happening?\n\n212\n00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.400\nWell, configurations drift is\nwhen those changes happen.\n\n213\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.220\nNow, it would be worse, right,\n\n214\n00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.070\nwhen you actually have configuration\nchanges that would be, they decide,\n\n215\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.710\nI'm just gonna install DHCP, or\nI'm gonna turn this into a DNS server.\n\n216\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.490\nI'm gonna do all this other things.\n\n217\n00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.600\nThat can be much more damaging.\n\n218\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.416\nBut at the same time,\neach one of those, right,\n\n219\n00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:36.625\nare issues that need to be corrected.\n\n220\n00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:40.327\nAnd the weird thing is, even though we\ncan correct some of the configurations,\n\n221\n00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:43.730\nthat's not the issue and\nthe problem the majority of the time.\n\n222\n00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.482\nThe problem happens to be,\nwell, this guy right here, or\n\n223\n00:12:46.482 --> 00:12:49.430\ndon't want to point at Cherokee,\nthat's why I'm pointing at me.\n\n224\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.220\nSo like I said,\nI'm going to point at me instead.\n\n225\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.540\n&gt;&gt; Human error, right?\n\n226\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.260\n&gt;&gt; It's usually some type of human error.\n\n227\n00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.270\nThe very fact that either I wasn't\nclear enough in my instructions on what\n\n228\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.130\nI said should be here.\n\n229\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.610\nOr the very fact that somebody kind of\ndidn't hear exactly what needed to be\n\n230\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.740\nhappening here.\n\n231\n00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.980\nSo this is where we can kind of\njump into something else and\n\n232\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.380\nrealize as we continue on that\ndesired state may help us out.\n\n233\n00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.550\nNow, we're going to talk about one other\narea, to, before we get into this.\n\n234\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.460\nBut this is where desired\nstate is going to help us out.\n\n235\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.830\nAnd each one of those\ninstances is going to help us.\n\n236\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.130\nBut let's talk about one more area,\nCherokee.\n\n237\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.540\nAnd I think that area is gonna be-\n&gt;&gt; PowerShell?\n\n238\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.330\n&gt;&gt; Management as well.\n\n239\n00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.780\n&gt;&gt; Working with scripts, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.570\n&gt;&gt; As well, and\nworking with scripts, right?\n\n241\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.670\nSo we can try and do that.\n\n242\n00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.690\nSo let's say this, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.630\nWhat we do is we limit.\n\n244\n00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.110\nAnd we go, all right, this GUI interface,\nwe're gonna limit this.\n\n245\n00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:46.260\nWe don't want to run as much,\nso that way, people that really\n\n246\n00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.560\ndon't know PowerShell, okay, they're\ngonna be a little bit more hesitant.\n\n247\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.480\n&gt;&gt; Reluctant to go ahead and modify things\nbecause, well, they might not know how to.\n\n248\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.860\nSo maybe we can keep things\na little more standardized, right?\n\n249\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.970\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like it, right?\n\n250\n00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.170\nThat sounds like a good idea.\n\n251\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.010\nYou scare them.\n\n252\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:06.520\nYou give them just a blinking insertion\npoint there on the command line prompt,\n\n253\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.880\nand go, dude if you can do it,\nthen go ahead and try.\n\n254\n00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.415\nBut, right, a lot of times that\nmeans we're gonna be scripting more.\n\n255\n00:14:16.415 --> 00:14:19.800\nAnd all the sudden now,\nwhat ends up happening is\n\n256\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.680\nI'm now starting to see a folder that I\nput on that server that says scripts.\n\n257\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.600\nAnd instead of the six or seven scripts\nthat I have, Cherokee's added 25 or\n\n258\n00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.000\n35 scripts in there, okay?\n\n259\n00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.080\nAnd now I'm like,\nwhat the heck are all these scripts about?\n\n260\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.020\nNow, Cherokee may know exactly what\neach and every one of them is about, but\n\n261\n00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.640\nthe only thing that I can do is\nI'd have to open up each script-\n\n262\n00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.990\n&gt;&gt; And try to decipher it, yeah.\n\n263\n00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.580\n&gt;&gt; Examine what it looks like it,\nyeah, parse through it and\n\n264\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.280\nfigure out what's going on.\n\n265\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.064\nSo even in that sense, right,\n\n266\n00:14:48.064 --> 00:14:52.590\nthat's a little bit hard to deal with\nthe idea of management, too, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:57.540\nAnd also, the complexity of PowerShell,\nokay, makes it a little bit more.\n\n268\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.010\nNow, don't get me wrong,\nPowerShell is a great tool,\n\n269\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:05.420\nand Ive been using it more and\nmore as my career has moved on in IT.\n\n270\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.570\nAnd not as timid about it as I used to be.\n\n271\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.650\nBut at the same time, it can become\ncomplex when you start actually\n\n272\n00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.510\npiping things into other\nthings into other things.\n\n273\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.190\nIt can get a little bit more complex.\n\n274\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.510\nIs it much more efficient?\n\n275\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.040\nAbsolutely, when working with\nmultiple machines at the same time.\n\n276\n00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.320\nBut it can become complex as well.\n\n277\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.840\nAnd then, when you do have\nthat multiple people, again,\n\n278\n00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:35.020\ninconsistencies between how Cherokee goes,\nthis is how I like to put things in order.\n\n279\n00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.692\nAnd all the sudden I start\nreading somebody elses and\n\n280\n00:15:37.692 --> 00:15:40.035\nlike, my gosh that looks so different.\n\n281\n00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:42.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's so confusing in that order.\n\n282\n00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Why is she doing this?\n\n283\n00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nsometimes the order doesn't matter, okay,\n\n284\n00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.690\nin how you make the PowerShell script.\n\n285\n00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.744\nBut in my own logic-\n&gt;&gt; Sequencing, sometimes it does.\n\n286\n00:15:49.744 --> 00:15:51.147\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it does.\n\n287\n00:15:51.147 --> 00:15:56.592\nBut in my mind, I'm like here's\nthe logical steps that it should follow.\n\n288\n00:15:56.592 --> 00:15:58.715\nBut here's this up here,\nhere's this up here.\n\n289\n00:15:58.715 --> 00:16:00.944\nAnd it begins to get\na little bit more confusing.\n\n290\n00:16:00.944 --> 00:16:05.926\nSo with all these issues,\nwhether we're talking about installation,\n\n291\n00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:10.582\nwhether we're talking about the idea\nof maintenance or managing,\n\n292\n00:16:10.582 --> 00:16:14.501\nthat really can blow up an IT person's,\na system admin,\n\n293\n00:16:14.501 --> 00:16:20.080\na Windows Server admin's time to no end\njust trying to correct errors like this.\n\n294\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.270\nSo this is why we want to talk\nabout the idea of PowerShell,\n\n295\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.640\nit is\nPowerShell Desired State Configuration,\n\n296\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.400\nbut that's what we actually\nwant to do as well.\n\n297\n00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, with Desired State Configuration,\n\n298\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.080\nhow is that actually going\nto help us in this manner?\n\n299\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.340\n&gt;&gt; When it comes down to the idea\nof Desired State Configuration,\n\n300\n00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.200\nthere's one more thing that I\njust looked down at my notes and\n\n301\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.430\nI realized something else too\nthat we need to talk about.\n\n302\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.640\nIt helps us because you and\n\n303\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.360\nI now, we do not have to actually\nfigure out how to configure things.\n\n304\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.340\nThat's kind of the biggest\nthing in the world and\n\n305\n00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.760\nI know you're like, that sounds silly,\nof course, you should know how to.\n\n306\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.020\nYes, you should know how\nto configure things.\n\n307\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.835\nBut, with Desired State Configuration,\nit says, you don't worry about it,\n\n308\n00:17:09.835 --> 00:17:15.450\nlet PowerShell worry about how\nthings are to be configured.\n\n309\n00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.310\nIt knows how to do it, and\n\n310\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:23.360\nall you have to do is instruct it on\nwhat you desire to end up seeing.\n\n311\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.470\nNow, the neat thing about Desired State\nConfiguration and how it helps us out\n\n312\n00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.990\nin all those other things, first it\nprovides the consistency that we need.\n\n313\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.420\nBecause it's no longer about whether\nit's you or I doing it, Cherokee.\n\n314\n00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:41.340\nNow, you and I just kind of figure out the\nconfiguration vals, and once we do that\n\n315\n00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:46.400\nand figure out how to run those, Desired\nState Configuration in PowerShell says\n\n316\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.990\nlet me handle the day to day task,\nthe operations of things.\n\n317\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.330\nAnd so, this is where we can bring in\nan unusual entertainment analogy and\n\n318\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.160\nthis is one that's made all over the net.\n\n319\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.891\nThis is absolutely\nthe Star Trek analogy here,\n\n320\n00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:05.447\nthat we essentially become Captain Picard.\n\n321\n00:18:05.447 --> 00:18:08.245\nAnd the famous phrase that he's known for-\n&gt;&gt; You're losing me, Ronnie.\n\n322\n00:18:08.245 --> 00:18:11.031\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, Star Trek, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:13.758\nThis is not the one with Han Solo in it,\nit's the one with the other ones, okay?\n\n324\n00:18:13.758 --> 00:18:16.172\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I know I got this,\nbut all right [LAUGH].\n\n325\n00:18:16.172 --> 00:18:20.904\n&gt;&gt; Star Trek here, the captain,\nthe bald guy, when he actually needs\n\n326\n00:18:20.904 --> 00:18:25.990\nsomething done, he doesn't go in there and\nconfigure and does it.\n\n327\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.630\nHe's the captain,\nhe just says, make it so.\n\n328\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.650\nThat's exactly what we do.\n\n329\n00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:37.460\nDesired State Configuration makes us\nessentially that same person that says,\n\n330\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.040\nget it done.\n\n331\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.640\nAnd what we're doing is we're saying\nhere's what he wants done and\n\n332\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.080\nPowerShell is able to take that and\n\n333\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.140\ninterpret that and\nsay let me just get it done in the way.\n\n334\n00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.330\nAnd all of us are using it, right?\n\n335\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.970\nDoesn't matter who is actually the one\nthat's saying let's make it that way.\n\n336\n00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.450\nIt only really matters, the engine\nbehind it is going to do it consistently\n\n337\n00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.420\ntime after time without very many\nissues to deal with it here.\n\n338\n00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:09.520\nNow when you start to do this here and\nstart to look around it's neat,\n\n339\n00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.100\nbecause the Desired State Configuration\nfor\n\n340\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:18.220\nPower Shell here can be used to\ncontrol services, that we want.\n\n341\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.040\nIt can be used to control users, groups,\napplications, registry settings.\n\n342\n00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:29.175\nNow, everything that I've mentioned,\nyou go that's Windows-centric,\n\n343\n00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:33.483\nwell it is but because its PowerShell\nits Windows-centric but DSC,\n\n344\n00:19:33.483 --> 00:19:37.980\nDesired State Configuration,\nitself is not just Windows-centric.\n\n345\n00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.770\nSo if we go back to some of the things\nthat were talked about just a little bit\n\n346\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.070\nago, Cherokee.\n\n347\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.170\nThe very fact is I mention essentially all\nWindows servers in every scenario that was\n\n348\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.410\nreally bad that I mentioned, and I don't\nmean to pick on Windows in that way.\n\n349\n00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.680\nBut what if we threw a couple\nLinux servers into this?\n\n350\n00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.240\nCan people mess those things up?\n\n351\n00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.030\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Just as easily, okay.\n\n352\n00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.630\nWell, Desired State Configuration\nsays I'll reconfigure.\n\n353\n00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:02.326\n&gt;&gt; I don't discriminate.\n\n354\n00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't discriminate,\nI'll do that too.\n\n355\n00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:05.670\nAnd you go, how's it doing it?\n\n356\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:13.110\nIt's because it is a standards based type\nof command structure or configuration.\n\n357\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.850\nIt doesn't care whether it's Windows or\nnot.\n\n358\n00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.350\nAs long as it can actually read it,\n\n359\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:22.410\nas long as it can get those files in the\nway it needs to, it absolutely can run.\n\n360\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.080\nSo its not limiting in that\nsense to just Windows.\n\n361\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.630\nNow that means that if you write them\nin the way that you're supposed to,\n\n362\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.580\nit can really affect change.\n\n363\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.590\nAnd the world is heading\nthat way very quickly\n\n364\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.150\nin which Desired State Configuration\nis going on.\n\n365\n00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.531\nIs really making a big change\ninside of the industry as you start\n\n366\n00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:45.607\ndoing this because it does actually\nprovide what we want here.\n\n367\n00:20:45.607 --> 00:20:50.006\nIt simplifies the idea here of being\nable to manage multiple systems\n\n368\n00:20:50.006 --> 00:20:54.900\nautomatically without you and\nI really having to do much about it.\n\n369\n00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.309\nConfiguration, standardization is\ngonna come much easier for us as well.\n\n370\n00:20:59.309 --> 00:21:04.446\nAnd ensures that at least at the very\nbeginning, if we wanted to get\n\n371\n00:21:04.446 --> 00:21:09.493\na server installed right away,\nwe can make sure that initially,\n\n372\n00:21:09.493 --> 00:21:15.230\neverything is actually identical\nbetween multiple servers.\n\n373\n00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:19.580\nSo it does help us to\nactually be able to do that.\n\n374\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.120\nAll the presets that we worry about,\nwe again don't have to worry about\n\n375\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.930\nhow to configure it as much as we say,\nhere are the things I want turned on,\n\n376\n00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.120\nhere are the things I wanna\nmake sure are never turned on.\n\n377\n00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.018\nAnd that way we can actually adjust and\n\n378\n00:21:32.018 --> 00:21:35.471\ndo what we actually want to make sure\nthat we are ending up doing here.\n\n379\n00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:37.721\nSo it is a very powerful way for\n\n380\n00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:41.869\nus to be able to have that\nmuch control on our networks.\n\n381\n00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:45.741\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we talk about\ndifferent ways that we can actually used\n\n382\n00:21:45.741 --> 00:21:49.106\nDesired State Configuration,\nwhat are some specific uses and\n\n383\n00:21:49.106 --> 00:21:51.532\nterms that we should be aware of for\nthe exam?\n\n384\n00:21:51.532 --> 00:21:56.268\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when it comes down to it,\nthere's a couple of different\n\n385\n00:21:56.268 --> 00:22:01.190\nconfiguration modes that you definitely\nwant to be familiar with here.\n\n386\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.730\nAnd when we get into the exam purpose,\nwe'll talk about this just briefly as\n\n387\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.890\nwell, but we'll get into it and we'll\nshow you an example of one of these too.\n\n388\n00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.710\nThere's two real configuration modes for\nus.\n\n389\n00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.526\nThere's what we call a pull\nconfiguration mode and\n\n390\n00:22:14.526 --> 00:22:17.678\nthere's what we call a push\nconfiguration mode as well.\n\n391\n00:22:17.678 --> 00:22:23.080\nAnd if my computer didn't just\nlogged me out here, so I'm back on.\n\n392\n00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.660\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer here, and\n\n393\n00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:30.330\nthis will,\nI hope watching will make sense to you.\n\n394\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.440\nSo here it is, I've actually put this\nphrase in there, that essentially,\n\n395\n00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.400\nhopefully helps us to understand\nwhat we're looking at.\n\n396\n00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.086\nLet's take for an example that we have\nwhat we call a pull configuration mode.\n\n397\n00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:49.110\nA pull configuration mode allows me to\ntake these individual servers here.\n\n398\n00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.830\nAnd what they can do is periodically,\nif we set it that way,\n\n399\n00:22:53.830 --> 00:23:00.000\nto contact a single server that has\nthose configurations stored on it.\n\n400\n00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.960\nAnd in that particular mode, there's two\ndifferent ways that this can be done.\n\n401\n00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.010\nEither it is set up as an SMB server.\n\n402\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:14.970\nAn SMB server for a Desired State is just\na server that has a SMB share on it.\n\n403\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.440\nI mean, that's what it comes down to.\n\n404\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.020\nYou make those configurations that you\nwant, you store them in a file here.\n\n405\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.900\nAnd then, the computers over\nhere on the right hand side,\n\n406\n00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.990\nthey all go ahead and\ngo all right, let's go ahead and\n\n407\n00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.880\ncheck that, let's make it what\nthis Desired State is going to be.\n\n408\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.320\nAnd they pull that configuration\nfrom that one centralized share.\n\n409\n00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.480\nNow, it can also, of course, be done\nthrough a web server at the same time.\n\n410\n00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.690\nSo normally you choose one or the other\nit's just up to you on how you do this.\n\n411\n00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:53.773\nSo if you setup IIS,\nin Windows Server as an example, right?\n\n412\n00:23:53.773 --> 00:23:57.526\nWell, this gives us that ability\nto setup that structure and\n\n413\n00:23:57.526 --> 00:24:00.188\nyou actually have to choose a port number.\n\n414\n00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:01.828\nYou'll get everything configured.\n\n415\n00:24:01.828 --> 00:24:06.984\nIdeally, if you do this, you'll also\nneed a PKI infrastructure, right,\n\n416\n00:24:06.984 --> 00:24:12.100\nyour public key infrastructure to\nassign certificates to do this.\n\n417\n00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.180\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhy do we need a certificate?\n\n418\n00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.620\nWell, you don't have to have it, but\nthis is something you do want to have.\n\n419\n00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.706\nThese configurations can contain,\n\n420\n00:24:21.706 --> 00:24:26.340\nwell, information that you do not\nwant exposed out to the network.\n\n421\n00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.690\nSo in that sense,\n\n422\n00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.268\nyou wanna make sure that that particular\ntraffic is going to be encrypted.\n\n423\n00:24:31.268 --> 00:24:35.350\nYou also wanna make sure that\nyou're only gonna be pulling from\n\n424\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.880\nyour particular DSC web-based\nserver when you do that.\n\n425\n00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.070\nOkay, so that's what you\nactually want to be able to do.\n\n426\n00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.540\nNow notice over here, they're all\nconfigured to pull from this, and\n\n427\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.360\nthen they can be scheduled for updates.\n\n428\n00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.420\nSo in other words, just check it so\noften if you want to.\n\n429\n00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.150\nNormally, for us,\nthe whole idea behind this and\n\n430\n00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:58.070\nthe reason why companies\nwould end up using it, right,\n\n431\n00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:03.600\nenterprise users will actually use this to\nsimplify and to scale out configurations.\n\n432\n00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.980\nSo we don't have to worry about actually\nchanging every single server here, okay?\n\n433\n00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.957\nWe just say,\nonce we plug it onto the network,\n\n434\n00:25:10.957 --> 00:25:13.170\nit's gonna do the check\nthat it needs to do.\n\n435\n00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.630\n&gt;&gt; And by doing this,\nwe're actually automating it.\n\n436\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.450\nSo that's where that term simplifying\ncomes into play, because,\n\n437\n00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.000\nhey, I don't have to do anything,\nit's already working behind the scenes.\n\n438\n00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.714\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthis is kind of the big one, right?\n\n439\n00:25:24.714 --> 00:25:30.500\nNow, this one, the configurations,\nright, they're not as complex.\n\n440\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.100\nBut getting everything set up on what\nwe call that pull server at that point,\n\n441\n00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.180\nmaking sure that you have\nthe certificates ready,\n\n442\n00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.200\nmaking sure all that's done,\nit can be a bit challenging.\n\n443\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.190\nSo do take a look at that, and even\nconfiguring the configuration just for\n\n444\n00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.890\nthe DSC web server.\n\n445\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.405\nThere's a lot more to it than what\nwe're gonna actually end up seeing in\n\n446\n00:25:51.405 --> 00:25:55.200\nthe example that we're gonna do so\nthat we can verify what's going on here.\n\n447\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.805\nThe other one, and this is the example\nwe are going to do right here, why?\n\n448\n00:25:58.805 --> 00:26:00.020\nCuz it's simpler on me,\n\n449\n00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.530\nis what it came down to, but\nit kinda gets the same idea done.\n\n450\n00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:09.550\nMake it so, okay, notice it's\nactually over here on this side.\n\n451\n00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.540\nYou have your own management server.\n\n452\n00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:16.472\nIt can be whatever server that you\nwant to, as long as it's running\n\n453\n00:26:16.472 --> 00:26:22.010\nyour PowerShell, and\nusually it's version 4, okay, or higher.\n\n454\n00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:27.954\nAnd then you're running WMF,\nyour Windows Management Framework.\n\n455\n00:26:27.954 --> 00:26:31.998\n5 is ideal to actually make\nall your dreams come to life,\n\n456\n00:26:31.998 --> 00:26:35.305\nespecially if you're\ndoing the pull server.\n\n457\n00:26:35.305 --> 00:26:38.768\nIt's gonna actually make\neverything happen, but\n\n458\n00:26:38.768 --> 00:26:41.900\nit pushes it on an as-needed basis.\n\n459\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.970\nThat's the key term here, okay?\n\n460\n00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.192\nWhen you actually do a push server, okay,\n\n461\n00:26:46.192 --> 00:26:49.910\nwe're gonna take a look at\nthis as an as-needed basis.\n\n462\n00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.210\nSo in this sense, there's just a couple\nof things you need to have, right?\n\n463\n00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.830\nTo make everything work, clients and\nwhoever your management server is gonna\n\n464\n00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.630\nbe, they should be in the same domain,\nokay?\n\n465\n00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.800\nThese machines need to make sure that they\nhave remote management enabled, okay?\n\n466\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.764\nThis process can also be automated,\nas well,\n\n467\n00:27:08.764 --> 00:27:11.730\nwhen we run this and\nmake sure that it happens.\n\n468\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.000\nAlong with this, there's really\nanother term that you need to know,\n\n469\n00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.570\nwhich is LCM, or\nlocal configuration manger.\n\n470\n00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.820\nLocal configuration manager is the engine\n\n471\n00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.000\nthat pushes that desired\nstate out to the clients.\n\n472\n00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.540\nSo every single one of these devices\nthat is running PowerShell or\n\n473\n00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.730\nDSC, okay, will also be able\nto have that LCM configured.\n\n474\n00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.170\nSo in that sense, they'll actually get\n\n475\n00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:47.550\nthe configuration file from this one\nsingle server that will push it out, and\n\n476\n00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.930\nthen they will run it on\nthe individual machines.\n\n477\n00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:56.400\nSo pull server, push server,\nlocal configuration manager,\n\n478\n00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.098\nand then the files that we\ngenerate are what we call .MOFs.\n\n479\n00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:03.600\nNow, we're gonna take a look at an MOF,\nand\n\n480\n00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.676\nwe're gonna describe\nthat inside of our demo.\n\n481\n00:28:06.676 --> 00:28:12.070\nBut overall, though, you'll see that it's\nreally not as difficult as it sounds,\n\n482\n00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.530\nbut it does take a little\nbit of time to set up.\n\n483\n00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.553\nSo Cherokee, I believe this is a great\nplace for us to go ahead and stop.\n\n484\n00:28:17.553 --> 00:28:20.854\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, so it sounds like\nwe do have a bit of installation or\n\n485\n00:28:20.854 --> 00:28:24.833\nconfiguration, but in the long run, it's\nreally gonna make our lives a bit easier.\n\n486\n00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:27.155\nSo I'm excited for this next episode.\n\n487\n00:28:27.155 --> 00:28:30.815\nWe'll go ahead and get into that\nconfiguration and setup process.\n\n488\n00:28:30.815 --> 00:28:34.405\nBut we are out of time for this show,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n489\n00:28:34.405 --> 00:28:36.025\nAs your host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n490\n00:28:36.025 --> 00:28:36.835\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n491\n00:28:36.835 --> 00:28:39.184\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n492\n00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:45.174\n[MUSIC]\n\n493\n00:28:45.174 --> 00:28:48.431\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

San Francisco Bay.\n\n3\n00:00:05.498 --> 00:00:08.227\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:11.040\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.664\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your\nMicrosoft Server 70-410 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.664 --> 00:00:18.260\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.740\nIn this episode, we'll continue to speak\nabout desired state configuration, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160\nwe'll actually get in there and\nperform some demonstrations for you.\n\n9\n00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.070\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.320\nHow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.570\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Cherokee, thank you\nfor having me back on the show as we\n\n12\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.560\ncontinue to take a look at the idea\nof desired state configuration.\n\n13\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.200\nNow remember, this is going to be a very\nimportant technology that's going to\n\n14\n00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.350\nmove not only through Server 2012,\nbut even into the future.\n\n15\n00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.460\nAnd even outside of the realm\nof Window servers itself.\n\n16\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.860\nSo it's an important topic.\n\n17\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.450\nIt's something that we've already\ndiscussed in the previous episode.\n\n18\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.813\nSo make sure you check out that episode\nbefore jumping into a part two.\n\n19\n00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:01.505\nI know it sounds logical but if you happen\nto go, I just want to see what part two is\n\n20\n00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:04.062\nabout, well,\nwe're about to see a demonstration of it.\n\n21\n00:01:04.062 --> 00:01:07.588\nBut if you want to know the reasons\nwhy we're actually doing it,\n\n22\n00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:10.283\nmake sure you also check\nout the part one as well.\n\n23\n00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:15.212\nSo here we are, we are now ready\nto talk about going ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:17.314\ndoing a demonstration.\n\n25\n00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:19.600\nWell, remember that there's\ntwo different modes.\n\n26\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.760\nSo if it's been a while since\nyou've actually seen the part one.\n\n27\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.780\nSo even if it's just been a day,\n\n28\n00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.210\nremember that there's two different\nmodes that we have access to.\n\n29\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.508\nAnd one is the pull mode, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:33.720\nThe pull, P-U-L-L, I don't know why it\njust sounds strange when it comes out of\n\n31\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.000\nmy mouth right now,\nis when a machine goes and\n\n32\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.890\ntalks to another server that has\nall the configurations on it.\n\n33\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.440\nAnd it says give me a copy of that\nparticular desired state, and\n\n34\n00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.290\nthen it will make it happen.\n\n35\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.570\nSo that is the idea of the pull.\n\n36\n00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.630\nAnd that is run, again, automated and\n\n37\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.740\nwe can script this out to actually have\nit update periodically and check it.\n\n38\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.540\nEnterprises like this because it means\nthat they can scale very easily to do so.\n\n39\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.000\nThe push mode is run on as needed basis.\n\n40\n00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.460\nAnd this is instead when you have a single\nmanagement server of some sort or\n\n41\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.598\njust a computer that actually\nhas a PowerShell on it.\n\n42\n00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:17.090\nAnd that's a cool thing about desired\nstate configuration, at least in Windows,\n\n43\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.830\nis that you don't have to learn\na complete different language.\n\n44\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.590\nEverything that you're\nactually doing really is like\n\n45\n00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.660\neverything that you do in PowerShell.\n\n46\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.900\nSo it actually does run for\nyou and do that.\n\n47\n00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.620\nAnd here you're actually\ncreating that configuration, and\n\n48\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.920\nthen you're pushing it out.\n\n49\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.290\nYou're running everything pretty\nmuch from that one machine, and\n\n50\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.730\nyou're actually going to push it\nout to the environment around us.\n\n51\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.330\nSo when we start to do this,\n\n52\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.160\nthose are the two main configurations\nwe're going to talk about.\n\n53\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, so today for\nthe demonstration,\n\n54\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.020\nwhat type of configuration will it be,\nthe push or the pull?\n\n55\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.170\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna do a push configuration.\n\n56\n00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.980\nAnd I mentioned in the last episode,\n\n57\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.500\nwith the pull you can get away without\ndoing a lot of things that really\n\n58\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.030\nare necessary in production to do this in\na testing environment like we're doing.\n\n59\n00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.280\nBut at the same time, that doesn't\nshow you the real scope in the nature\n\n60\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.330\nwhen you start having to actually\nimplement things like security.\n\n61\n00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.740\nSo overall, though,\nthat's something that you can learn.\n\n62\n00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.690\nBut you'll see that\nthe files themselves and\n\n63\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.990\neverything that we're doing, it pretty\nmuch is fairly simple in that sense.\n\n64\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.770\nBut at the same time, setting up all those\nother things that they're not set up,\n\n65\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.510\nyou have to make sure that\neverything is actually in place.\n\n66\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.440\nSo we're going to do a simple\npush configuration to do this.\n\n67\n00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.150\nSo the great thing about this, and also\nfor the exam as you're preparing for it.\n\n68\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.810\nIs if you haven't taken\na Microsoft exam before,\n\n69\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.450\nwhich I'm pretty sure you have\nif you going for the MCSA here.\n\n70\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.250\nRemember that they love this\nidea of scenarios, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.140\nLove the idea of actually saying,\nall right, so\n\n72\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.500\nwhat kind of scenario can\nwe come up with that we\n\n73\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.740\nwould actually choose do something like\nthis and these are the key terms, right?\n\n74\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.850\nSo I too have kind of\ncome up with a scenario.\n\n75\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.105\nIn a previous episode where we\ntalked about installing server.\n\n76\n00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:12.201\nWe also saw where Cherokee\nhelped us out by installing\n\n77\n00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:17.194\nthe GUI edition of\nthe Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n78\n00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:21.241\nAnd then at the end of that episode,\nshe also went ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.051\nremoved the graphical user interface,\n\n80\n00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:28.702\nessentially stripping it down to\nServer Core Edition too, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:33.630\nNow, that is a nice kind of\nlittle preventative type of\n\n82\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.190\naction that we can do that can really\nhold somebody back from going,\n\n83\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.240\nlet me do this and just kind of\nconfigure it the way that we want to.\n\n84\n00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.307\nCuz it's not just point and click anymore.\n\n85\n00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:46.853\nNow you actually have to know\nthe commands to at least run them.\n\n86\n00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:51.206\nWell, let's say that we kind\nof decided that as our group,\n\n87\n00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:55.558\nthat one of the things that we\nwant to do was on servers that we\n\n88\n00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:59.870\nwanted to run that really\ndidn't need a lot of access.\n\n89\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.580\nAnd we wanted to control\nthe configuration that we're on.\n\n90\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.880\nWe decided that we would\ntake our servers and\n\n91\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.240\nessentially change them\nfrom what they were, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.800\nWhich is of course, going from, let's say,\nthe full graphical user interface or\n\n93\n00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.760\nthe desktop experience interface,\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n94\n00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.900\nTo actually going all\nthe way down to essentially\n\n95\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.730\njust that Server Core Edition\nof doing things, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.560\nSo we are going to do\na desired state configuration.\n\n97\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.420\nAnd we're gonna do that, we're gonna\ntake a regular Server 2012 install.\n\n98\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.390\nWe're going to tell desired state to,\nhey, go ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.660\nlet's change this, let's change it\nall the way back down to Server Core.\n\n100\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.950\nThe other thing that we're going\nto do is we're gonna tell it that,\n\n101\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.650\nthat is the desired state, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.155\nAnd you probably say,\nwhy does he keep emphasizing that?\n\n103\n00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:58.530\nI'm going to emphasize that because what\nwe are actually hoping it also does,\n\n104\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.410\nif everything goes right, I'm probably\ngoing to fat finger a few things,\n\n105\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.660\nyou are probably going to\nsee red all over the screen.\n\n106\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.843\nBut if everything goes right and\neverything is actually going to be done,\n\n107\n00:06:07.843 --> 00:06:11.689\neven if somebody were to come along and\ngo I don't care what Ronnie or\n\n108\n00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.960\nCherokee wants here, okay?\n\n109\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.780\nI'm going to go ahead and\ninstall back everything, right?\n\n110\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.850\nThere's a power shell commandlet to help\nus to install that Windows feature again.\n\n111\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.550\nSo they run that.\n\n112\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.770\nBut desired state should counter them,\nokay,\n\n113\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.530\nand actually kind of let them know,\nit's not gonna work for them.\n\n114\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.160\nSo that's what we're actually\nhoping that will end up happening.\n\n115\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.440\nAnd so that's what we wanna show you here,\nis that ability for\n\n116\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.930\ndesired state to keep that desired state.\n\n117\n00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.050\nRemember that this also is neat, because\nonce you actually get the configuration\n\n118\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.620\nfiles out, you don't actually have\nto know anything else about how it\n\n119\n00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.790\nactually uninstalls, what actually needed\nto be uninstalled, did it have to reboot,\n\n120\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.350\ndid it have to do anything?\n\n121\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.850\nIt will go through the process and\ndo it for you.\n\n122\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.510\nWhen the process is done,\nit will keep that configuration state\n\n123\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.720\nif something changes depending\non how you've got it set up.\n\n124\n00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.290\nSo we're gonna walk you through this\nprocess and show you what's going on.\n\n125\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.890\nSo in my lab environment,\nI've got three different machines.\n\n126\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.540\nI've got domain controller\nrunning in the background,\n\n127\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.000\nI'm not gonna worry about showing that.\n\n128\n00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.368\nAnd then I have a management server and\nI have my target server.\n\n129\n00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:20.428\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I'm talking about here.\n\n130\n00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:24.843\nSo here is gonna be just the,\nI've just got Windows 10 running, okay,\n\n131\n00:07:24.843 --> 00:07:27.290\non this particular machine here.\n\n132\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.130\nAnd I'm running the PowerShell ISE.\n\n133\n00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.530\nSo that we can see some of these\ndifferent configurations and\n\n134\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.240\nwhat we actually have to do here.\n\n135\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.330\nAnd here is gonna be my target server,\nokay?\n\n136\n00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.930\nSo this one right here is exactly,\nlike I said.\n\n137\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.100\nAnd then, Cherokee, you've logged\ninto this a couple of times here.\n\n138\n00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.676\nSo yep, you have.\n\n139\n00:07:45.676 --> 00:07:46.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n140\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.370\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n141\n00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.250\nSee, Cherokee has logged in a couple\n\n142\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.357\nof times.\nSo if I log in as Lance here,\n\n143\n00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:57.275\nif I can actually remember his password.\nHe has\n\n144\n00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:01.885\nthis long password.\nIt's like\n\n145\n00:08:01.885 --> 00:08:05.830\nthe secret I really love\n98 degrees [LAUGH].\n\n146\n00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.936\n&gt;&gt; Is that what group he's a part of?\n\n147\n00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:10.177\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] That was\nthe other boy band groups.\n\n148\n00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:10.943\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n149\n00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:11.618\n&gt;&gt; The secret.\n\n150\n00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:13.025\n&gt;&gt; So I did not know that, all right.\n\n151\n00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:15.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, if you were wondering\n\n152\n00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.770\nwhat's that about, cuz I'm reusing\na domain that I've already set up.\n\n153\n00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.810\nHere, and this actually worked for\nme quiet well, so I trust it.\n\n154\n00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.700\nSo there it is the full blown everything.\n\n155\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.630\nSo I'm just showing you\nthat it's actually there.\n\n156\n00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.990\nIt's ready to go and from this point\non we are simply just going to log out.\n\n157\n00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.210\nAnd that is our setup at this point.\n\n158\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.700\nSo I'm gonna Sign out and\nthere we go, okay,\n\n159\n00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.460\nso that machine is gonna be our target.\n\n160\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.450\nNow, from our management server there are\na couple of things we need to do before\n\n161\n00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.680\nthis is done, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.350\nWe need to make sure, of course,\nthat remote management is turned on, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:56.481\nSo we can actually run a command at\nthis point to make sure that everything\n\n164\n00:08:56.481 --> 00:09:02.222\nis running here, which is test.wsman and\nthen the ComputerName.\n\n165\n00:09:02.222 --> 00:09:06.323\nAnd what you're seeing popping up on the\nscreen, for those who are not as familiar\n\n166\n00:09:06.323 --> 00:09:10.170\nwith PowerShell, is that IntelliSense or\nintelligence, IntelliSense.\n\n167\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.980\nI couldn't remember\nwhat's it's called here.\n\n168\n00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.420\nIntelliSense here, SRV04, okay.\n\n169\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.370\nAnd when I get that output I know that\neverything is running, everything is good.\n\n170\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.670\nI know that this can be done here, okay.\n\n171\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.273\nSo the great thing is once\nPowerShell is installed,\n\n172\n00:09:30.273 --> 00:09:32.708\nyou just have to make sure\nthat on both machines.\n\n173\n00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:36.810\nIt's fairly equal in terms of\nthe what you're actually seeing.\n\n174\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:42.521\nSo if I do a Get-DscConfiguration,\n\n175\n00:09:45.695 --> 00:09:47.050\nLet me give it a moment here.\n\n176\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.550\nWell, maybe.\n\n177\n00:09:54.007 --> 00:09:57.310\nI know why that's not working,\nit's cuz I'm not running as administrator.\n\n178\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.800\nI was just looking at these\ncommands a little bit earlier so\n\n179\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.828\nthat's just me making a rookie\nmistake essentially, is what it is.\n\n180\n00:10:02.828 --> 00:10:08.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; PowerShell.\n\n181\n00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.434\nSo I'll run this as administrator now.\n\n182\n00:10:12.914 --> 00:10:14.570\nJust say Yes here.\n\n183\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.970\nAnd that should launch up\nPowerShell as the administrator and\n\n184\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.133\nallow me to run what I need to.\n\n185\n00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:21.780\nSo and I just realized something,\nI even ran the wrong command here okay?\n\n186\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:27.260\nSo what I wanted to do was to show\nyou Get-Dsc not the configuration\n\n187\n00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.470\nIs actually the resources here.\n\n188\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:33.400\nSo if I select that and then I press\nenter, notice it’s starting to load in\n\n189\n00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.180\na few of the different modules and\nit's creating this list for us.\n\n190\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.490\nAnd this is what you end up seeing is,\nthese are the list of modules and\n\n191\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.370\nthe resources in which we can\nconfigure and we can do and you can\n\n192\n00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.580\nactually see all the stuff that we have\nthat we're actually gonna do here okay.\n\n193\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.584\nSo our key what we’re gonna\nbe actually taking a look at,\n\n194\n00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:55.340\nit's really gonna be this\nWindowsFeature right here.\n\n195\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.080\nSo that actually is what's gonna\nallow me to configure that.\n\n196\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:06.440\nSo from this computer targeting\nthat SRV 04, the server 04 machine.\n\n197\n00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.690\nIt means that I can actually\ndo what I want to do.\n\n198\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:15.393\nWhich is to use this to essentially\nremove that GUI that I want to.\n\n199\n00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:18.930\nAll right, so how do we do that,\nwhat is it that we have to do?\n\n200\n00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.053\nWell, if you're gonna run desired\nstate configuration, right.\n\n201\n00:11:23.053 --> 00:11:25.789\nYou've got to get used to\ncreating a couple of files, and\n\n202\n00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:28.030\nthey're not difficult to create.\n\n203\n00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.430\nAnd the neat thing about them is,\nyou can use whatever you want to,\n\n204\n00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.530\nto create these files okay,\nyou really can.\n\n205\n00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.200\nBecause the whole goal behind here,\nis not that you're just gonna\n\n206\n00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.540\ncreate a PowerShell script, even though\nthat's what were gonna end up doing, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.630\nIs that, you can actually use\nanything that will allow you to\n\n208\n00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.260\ngenerate an ASCII file,\nis what you can do.\n\n209\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.370\nIf you like using anything that\ncan generate an ASCII file,\n\n210\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.610\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n211\n00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.641\nAnd if you're running it inside\nof Windows, like I am here.\n\n212\n00:11:55.641 --> 00:12:00.510\nWell, you're gonna actually name it\n.ps1 just as a script at the end.\n\n213\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.950\nLet's show you what the configuration\nactually ends up looking like, and\n\n214\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.890\nI'll show you it's not as bad as\nit actually sounds to do this.\n\n215\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.730\nI'm gonna clear off the screen there and\nmove this down a little bit.\n\n216\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.580\nSo there are couple of ways that\nhas come along in the past.\n\n217\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.970\nOr actually one way,\nwhich is this one here and\n\n218\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.730\nlet me go ahead and open up the way\nthat we are going to do it.\n\n219\n00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.640\nNow for this one which is right here too.\n\n220\n00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.737\nAll right, so if we select the old\nway of actually doing this,\n\n221\n00:12:32.737 --> 00:12:35.650\nI wanna point out some key words.\n\n222\n00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.793\nAnd you're saying why is\nhe pointing out key words.\n\n223\n00:12:37.793 --> 00:12:39.865\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's gotta be at least one\n\n224\n00:12:39.865 --> 00:12:44.708\nreason you can think about and it actually\nhappens to do with exam 70-410, okay.\n\n225\n00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:45.639\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n226\n00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:46.420\n&gt;&gt; So that's why.\n\n227\n00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.850\nSo we take a look at this configuration.\n\n228\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.320\nIt's just a text file that I typed in.\n\n229\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.980\nI could've used Notepad if I wanted to,\nokay.\n\n230\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.460\nThat's what essentially what we have here,\nokay.\n\n231\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.348\nThe key word here on the old method is\nwhere it says configuration at the top.\n\n232\n00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:06.590\nAnd then oops,\nI'm gonna do something bad here, aren't I?\n\n233\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.100\nYep, and I knew it, okay.\n\n234\n00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.610\nOkay?\n\n235\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.980\nAnd then you actually give this a name.\n\n236\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.990\nSo I just called this old to remind me\nthat this is the old method of doing so.\n\n237\n00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.220\nYou're gonna open up a set of brackets.\n\n238\n00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.720\nSo notice that this bracket is actually\ntied to this other one out here.\n\n239\n00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.650\nI like the styling of this.\n\n240\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.774\nYou don't have to do it this way, but\nit just makes it easier for me to read-\n\n241\n00:13:25.774 --> 00:13:27.786\n&gt;&gt; As long as they're there, they exist,\n\n242\n00:13:27.786 --> 00:13:29.630\nthey don't have to be so beautiful.\n\n243\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.640\n&gt;&gt; Aligned.\n&gt;&gt; In line, yes.\n\n244\n00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.270\n&gt;&gt; And then, you tell it what\nmachines you're going to run\n\n245\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.110\nthis particular\nconfiguration file against.\n\n246\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.270\nNow, in this file here, okay,\n\n247\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:46.440\nthis is not actually telling us right now,\nwhat I'm gonna do to the server.\n\n248\n00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.610\nIt's strange, but\nit's a two step process here.\n\n249\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:54.330\n&gt;&gt; You're actually telling the LC\non the LocalConfigurationManager.\n\n250\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.730\nLook at that, okay.\n\n251\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.110\nThe LocalConfigurationManager\non that destination machine.\n\n252\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.530\nI just created that variable, and\n\n253\n00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.430\nhere's the name of my destination\nmachine right here, okay.\n\n254\n00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.230\nYou're saying, go to that\nLocalConfigurationManager on that machine,\n\n255\n00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.362\nand set that up.\n\n256\n00:14:10.362 --> 00:14:14.000\nThe LocalConfigurationManager\nis the engine\n\n257\n00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.720\nthat pushes the desired\nstate configuration out.\n\n258\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:23.600\nSo what we're actually configuring is\nthe machine that does the configuration.\n\n259\n00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.840\nSo technically they call it metadata,\nor meta configuration,\n\n260\n00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.790\nwhatever you want to call it here, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.370\nSo that's what you're doing and\nin that, right?\n\n262\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.870\nNotice again, after we actually selected\nthe node, another set of brackets, and\n\n263\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.540\nthen LocalConfigurationManager, and\nthen another set of brackets here.\n\n264\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.020\nAnd these are the three things\nthat we are actually gonna tell.\n\n265\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.380\nNow there's a lot more to this, okay, let\nme show you what I'm talking about here.\n\n266\n00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.766\nIf you go and\n\n267\n00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:58.080\nyou type in Local Configuration Manager\nin your favorite search engine.\n\n268\n00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.994\nOne of the first things\nthat brought it up was\n\n269\n00:14:59.994 --> 00:15:02.700\nConfiguring the Local\nConfiguration Manager.\n\n270\n00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.372\nAs I scroll down through here, you'll see.\n\n271\n00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:09.096\nIt's just exact configuration,\nactually almost close,\n\n272\n00:15:09.096 --> 00:15:14.210\nwithout this top line here and also\nthe word settings is actually not there.\n\n273\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.790\nBut this is a newer configuration\nwhich we're about to look at, okay.\n\n274\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.230\nBut what we're taking a look at\nare these basic settings, okay.\n\n275\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.650\nI only chose three of the basic\nproperty settings, but\n\n276\n00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.190\nyou can see here where there's\nactually many different settings\n\n277\n00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.040\nthat are actually right here\nas we go on through, okay.\n\n278\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.490\nSo you can take a look at all\nthose different settings and\n\n279\n00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.220\ndecide what you want it\nto actually do here.\n\n280\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.760\nSo just take your favorite browser,\ntype in\n\n281\n00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.810\nlocal configuration manager and you'll\nprobably pop up on this very same site.\n\n282\n00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.734\nLet me go ahead and show the link a little\nbit easier for you to be able to see.\n\n283\n00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:55.183\nThis one's from MSDN here.\n\n284\n00:15:55.183 --> 00:15:58.996\nAnd PowerShell, and you can see\nwhat they call this metaconfig.\n\n285\n00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:01.956\nIs essentially what they\ncall this one right here.\n\n286\n00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:04.488\nNow that's actually important okay so\n\n287\n00:16:04.488 --> 00:16:08.600\nactually see that we're not\ngonna change this too much.\n\n288\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.570\nThe key one for\nus is gonna be right be here and\n\n289\n00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.770\nI'll talk about when we get to the new\none and show you what happen, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.500\nSo here is the refresh at the end.\n\n291\n00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:24.180\nAnd then, at the end of all that,\nwe essentially run that configuration.\n\n292\n00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.360\nSo I define the configuration\nup here at the top, and\n\n293\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.790\nthen at the end, I'm telling it to run.\n\n294\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.560\nNow, what is it going to produce?\n\n295\n00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.440\nIt's gonna produce a file is\nwhat it's going to produce here,\n\n296\n00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.572\nwhich is gonna be just a simple ASCII\nfile at the end once again, and\n\n297\n00:16:39.572 --> 00:16:44.390\nI've made a folder on my\ncomputer called DSC, and\n\n298\n00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.960\na subfolder for lcm, for\nthe metaconfig data.\n\n299\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.110\nAll right, so that's, all of that is done.\n\n300\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.260\nNow, the way that we're actually going\nto do this is not that differently.\n\n301\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.090\nWe've changed just\na couple of things here.\n\n302\n00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:06.230\nNotice that we add in this line\nup here at the very top, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:11.150\nThis one up here at the very top,\nthe dscLocalConfigurationManager and\n\n304\n00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.640\nnotice it looks like a function, right?\n\n305\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.570\nYou actually have\nthe little function there.\n\n306\n00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.230\nWell, this is actually telling it\n\n307\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.487\nthat it's gonna do something\na little bit different, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.760\nNow in the previous one that we looked at,\nit relied on a command called\n\n309\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.670\nstart dash DSC LocalConfigurationManager,\nokay?\n\n310\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.870\nThat's what the previous one relied on,\nand it's that command to make it run.\n\n311\n00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.670\nThis time though in the newer one.\n\n312\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:44.700\nThis actually relies on set dash\ndscLocalConfigurationManager to run.\n\n313\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.300\nIt's two different processes is what we're\nactually seeing here that's going on.\n\n314\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.660\nAnd this is the preferred\nmethod of doing this, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.780\nSo regardless of which one you see,\nI would make sure you at least\n\n316\n00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.000\npay attention to some of\nthese different concepts.\n\n317\n00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.510\n&gt;&gt; Now start and set dash when you're\ntalking about your power shell syntax.\n\n318\n00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:09.070\nI've sat through these exams guys, and the\nfirst time I actually sat down for, and\n\n319\n00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.420\nyes I did say first time for\n70-410, I was a little,\n\n320\n00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:18.270\nI underestimated the potential for\nthese exam questions.\n\n321\n00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:22.630\nI thought it was gonna be easy peasy and\nI really didn't prepare 100%.\n\n322\n00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:27.450\nWhen I got into that exam booth I saw\nthat hey this is not a COMPTIA a, b,\n\n323\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.680\nc, d type of multiple choice questioning.\n\n324\n00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.510\nWhen it comes to your PowerShell\nsyntax you can have G, H,\n\n325\n00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:39.400\neven multiple options for\nyour multiple choice questions.\n\n326\n00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.640\nSo, although what Ronnie said,\nhey guys, it's important to know that\n\n327\n00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.960\nthe particular syntax is set dash,\nwhen we're talking about that here.\n\n328\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.340\nIts a tiny little difference that when\nyou're sitting in the exam booth,\n\n329\n00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.970\nyour nerves are going and you're not,\nyou see something and it says start, and\n\n330\n00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.520\nyou're like, that must be it.\n\n331\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.450\nAnd then further down the list,\nyou see set.\n\n332\n00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.860\nThat's why it's important to read\nthrough all the options, and\n\n333\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.620\nalthough these are small details,\nthat's where you'll\n\n334\n00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.110\nsee a lot of PowerShell type questions\nbecause Microsoft has spent so\n\n335\n00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.870\nmuch time developing and working with\nPowerShell to improve it over the years\n\n336\n00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.420\nthat they wanna make sure you\nare familiar with their product.\n\n337\n00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.210\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n338\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah this is actually very\nimportant because that's\n\n339\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.778\nwhat you're gonna see a lot.\n\n340\n00:19:23.778 --> 00:19:28.910\nAnd regardless of what type of Microsoft\nexam that you're sitting from, sitting on,\n\n341\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:29.610\nor will be-\n&gt;&gt; For, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n342\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.370\n&gt;&gt; Sitting for.\n\n343\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.490\nFrom this point on you're gonna\nsee a lot more PowerShell.\n\n344\n00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:39.870\nSo here is kind of the key, if you take\na look and notice these things, right?\n\n345\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:44.410\nWhichever configuration that they show\nyou, okay, that's gonna be the key.\n\n346\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.640\nOne, if you see the square\nbrackets at the top right,\n\n347\n00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.790\nyou're gonna use the set-dscConfiguration.\n\n348\n00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:57.720\nIf you don't see them like this,\nit's gonna be the start-dscConfiguration.\n\n349\n00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.420\nI know you're probably like,\nare you joking me?\n\n350\n00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.160\nI'm not joking you.\n\n351\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.450\nThat's something you're just gonna\nhave to be able to get used to and\n\n352\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.360\nunderstand what's going on here, okay?\n\n353\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.993\nThe other thing that we're actually\ngoing to focus in on is right here in\n\n354\n00:20:10.993 --> 00:20:11.788\nthe settings.\n\n355\n00:20:11.788 --> 00:20:14.953\nNow, Cherokee,\nI guarantee you that right here, okay?\n\n356\n00:20:14.953 --> 00:20:19.382\nThis is private thing that will get\nus because even though I have this,\n\n357\n00:20:19.382 --> 00:20:23.964\nlet's say, this seem simple enough,\nAllowModuleOverwrite = true,\n\n358\n00:20:23.964 --> 00:20:26.760\nwell the only other answer is false, okay?\n\n359\n00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.330\nWell that's simple.\n\n360\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:33.440\nIf I don't want to allow an overwrite\nto happen, well I make it false, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.500\nIf I will allow an overwrite to happen,\nmake it true, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.390\nSo this is just a setting.\n\n363\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:44.080\nThis ConfiruationMode though,\nnotice I chose ApplyAndAutoCorrect.\n\n364\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.530\nNow that is actually different\nfrom the normal, okay?\n\n365\n00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.190\nSo if we wanna take a look at that,\nthat's what we'll do.\n\n366\n00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.960\n&gt;&gt; So with that setting that you chose,\n\n367\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.460\nif the system sees that there's any\ndeviation from your desired configuration,\n\n368\n00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.460\nit will apply those changes to correct,\nto auto correct it.\n\n369\n00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.890\nAnd that's what you're seeing there?\n\n370\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.850\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's go ahead and take a\nlook from the official documentation, and\n\n371\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.794\nthat will actually help us out.\n\n372\n00:21:07.794 --> 00:21:08.471\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's always\n\n373\n00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:09.130\nbest, right,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n374\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.180\n&gt;&gt; So here it is,\nhere's that configuration mode,\n\n375\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.490\njust like what we said here.\n\n376\n00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And now, if I zoom in, oops.\n\n377\n00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.100\nLet me try and\ncenter that a little bit more.\n\n378\n00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.380\nAnd zoom in right there.\n\n379\n00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.850\nLet me see if I can move that over so\nI can get my head back on the screen here.\n\n380\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:28.630\nAll right,\nDSC applies any new configurations, okay?\n\n381\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.270\nSo that's actually good.\n\n382\n00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:34.660\nAfter the initial application\nof a new configuration.\n\n383\n00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.910\nIf the target mode drifts\nfrom the desired state,\n\n384\n00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.220\nDSC reports the discrepancy and\nthen re-applies the current configuration.\n\n385\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.091\nSo this actually sounds like\nsomething that I can set it-\n\n386\n00:21:46.091 --> 00:21:47.097\n&gt;&gt; We spoke of that.\n\n387\n00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:47.852\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Configuration drift.\n\n388\n00:21:47.852 --> 00:21:49.793\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthe neat thing is I can set it and\n\n389\n00:21:49.793 --> 00:21:52.880\nI don’t have to worry if\nthe configuration drifts.\n\n390\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.030\nI don't have to come back in and\nchange it, it can do it for me, okay.\n\n391\n00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:03.060\nNow, that is good in a testing\nenvironment okay, and I really mean it.\n\n392\n00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.740\nIt's good in a production environment\nas long as you know that it's\n\n393\n00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.150\nactually happening.\n\n394\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:11.680\nSo you may instead also\nchoose ApplyAndMonitor.\n\n395\n00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.200\nNow you may be wondering like why\nthe heck would I choose ApplyAndMonitor\n\n396\n00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.810\nwhen I have choose an auto correct?\n\n397\n00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.788\nAuto correct Absolutely what we want.\n\n398\n00:22:17.788 --> 00:22:20.665\nEverybody loves auto-correct\nuntil you start texting, right?\n\n399\n00:22:20.665 --> 00:22:23.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Once you start texting,\n\n400\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.310\nthe auto-correct function, friend or foe?\n\n401\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.560\n&gt;&gt; Foe, there's not even a delete button,\neither.\n\n402\n00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.520\nYou can't retract that, so, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's strange, right?\n\n403\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.840\nWe want it to actually auto-correct.\n\n404\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.650\nThat's something we really do want.\n\n405\n00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.550\nBut at the same time,\nit gets fixed over and\n\n406\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.460\nover again, constantly getting\nfixed over and over again?\n\n407\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.800\nIt means somebody is doing what?\n\n408\n00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.570\nThey're changing, something is happening,\nsomebody's causing that thing to change.\n\n409\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.170\nSomething is happening, and you and\nI are not really noticing it because what?\n\n410\n00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.100\n&gt;&gt; How would you be aware?\n\n411\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.390\nThere's no alert or notification set up.\n\n412\n00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.616\n&gt;&gt; That's ApplyAndMonitor, there you go,\nso that actually lets you know.\n\n413\n00:23:00.616 --> 00:23:03.422\n[CROSSTALK] So notice that's what it does.\n\n414\n00:23:03.422 --> 00:23:06.619\nAfter initial configuration\ntarget node drifts,\n\n415\n00:23:06.619 --> 00:23:11.760\nDSC will report discrepancy and logs,\nhey, that is probably the better option.\n\n416\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.690\nBut I really wanted AutoCorrect.\n\n417\n00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:16.350\nI understand, okay?\n\n418\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.170\nBut if it's not logged,\nif it's not doing that for\n\n419\n00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.470\nyou, it means it can go on forever.\n\n420\n00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.480\nAnd you might wonder,\n&gt;&gt; All about that root cause.\n\n421\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.440\n&gt;&gt; And you might not have\never fixed the root cause.\n\n422\n00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.660\nSo this ApplyAndMonitor is\nprobably a better situation for\n\n423\n00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.920\nus in the real production sense.\n\n424\n00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.224\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now does it take a little bit longer?\n\n425\n00:23:36.224 --> 00:23:40.707\nYes, but at the same time at least\nyou know hey, that thing triggered,\n\n426\n00:23:40.707 --> 00:23:43.790\nsomebody's trying to do something.\n\n427\n00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.760\nOr whatever it is, I need to go and\ninvestigate it, okay?\n\n428\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.280\nAnd that's actually a very\nimportant option that you have.\n\n429\n00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.907\nIn our setting we're gonna do the auto\ncorrect because it's actually worth\n\n430\n00:23:52.907 --> 00:23:53.480\nthat to do.\n\n431\n00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.250\nAnd then of course there's ApplyOnly,\nokay?\n\n432\n00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.460\nDoes nothing further, okay?\n\n433\n00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.855\nSo applies unless a new configuration\nis pushed out to the target mode or\n\n434\n00:24:02.855 --> 00:24:05.260\nwhen a new configuration is pulled.\n\n435\n00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.050\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n436\n00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.910\nIt says, applied once, I'm kinda done.\n\n437\n00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.170\nAnd that actually does seem like\nthose options that are available.\n\n438\n00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.310\nSo you do need to know about those\noptions when you set that up because\n\n439\n00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:20.060\nit's gonna be very important in\nwhat it is that we'll be doing.\n\n440\n00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.210\nSo don't over look them.\n\n441\n00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.590\nAs you start to see something like this, I\ncould see, let's go back to my screen for\n\n442\n00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.470\nan example, and they show you this idea.\n\n443\n00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.340\nYou actually end up seeing it like this.\n\n444\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:35.400\nAnd they say which of the following,\nor what is the result of this,\n\n445\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.350\nyou should be able to understand that, be\nable to kinda go through and figure that.\n\n446\n00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.987\nI'm not gonna go to refresh mode\ncuz it's easy enough, right?\n\n447\n00:24:42.987 --> 00:24:44.535\nThere's either gonna be push or pull.\n\n448\n00:24:44.535 --> 00:24:45.398\nWe already discussed that.\n\n449\n00:24:45.398 --> 00:24:50.061\nI don't wanna kind of\nbelabor the point here.\n\n450\n00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:51.598\nBut it does make sense.\n\n451\n00:24:51.598 --> 00:24:53.688\nSo I didn't change everything else,\n\n452\n00:24:53.688 --> 00:24:57.162\neverything else is gonna be\nthe standard at what it needs to be.\n\n453\n00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:00.002\nAnd I believe, if I remember right,\n\n454\n00:25:00.002 --> 00:25:06.800\nApplyAndMonitor I think is what we\nnormally see as the default that is there.\n\n455\n00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.570\n&gt;&gt; All right Ronnie,\nI know we're getting close on time, and\n\n456\n00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:13.000\nwe still haven't broken anything,\nor fixed anything yet.\n\n457\n00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.260\nSo I'm thinking there's\ngonna be a part three here.\n\n458\n00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.130\n&gt;&gt; All right, that, that sounds good.\n\n459\n00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.050\nYeah, I talk a lot because there's\na lot of detail in here, and\n\n460\n00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.340\nwe just got to cover them.\n\n461\n00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.660\n&gt;&gt; No worries, I appreciate that, and\nI appreciate you for being here as well.\n\n462\n00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.920\nBut stay tuned because we're\nactually going to see how\n\n463\n00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.690\neverything pans out here\nwith our configurations.\n\n464\n00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.490\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n465\n00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.270\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n466\n00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:35.935\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n467\n00:25:35.935 --> 00:25:37.401\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n468\n00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:44.481\n[MUSIC]\n\n469\n00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:47.000\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:08.249\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.862\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.862 --> 00:00:15.857\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nMicrosoft Server 70-410 series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.791\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:22.341\nIf you're just joining us, this probably\nisn't the best place because we have two\n\n9\n00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:26.570\nother previous episodes that are really\nleading up to this particular show,\n\n10\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.429\nbecause back in the studios\nwith us today we have Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.722\nRonnie Wong to complete a demonstration\nof desired state configuration, and\n\n12\n00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:35.572\nhow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n13\n00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:36.661\n&gt;&gt; It's going well.\n\n14\n00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.516\nYou hope I'm gonna be completing this-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:39.572\n&gt;&gt; Demonstration, but\n\n16\n00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.571\nyeah we'll try our best here to do this.\n\n17\n00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:45.214\nSo, in the previous episode Cherokee\nreally, started talking about\n\n18\n00:00:45.214 --> 00:00:49.427\nthe idea of getting everything ready,\nand that's something that we have to do.\n\n19\n00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:52.153\nWe tested out and\nverified that everything was ready to go.\n\n20\n00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:53.840\nI'm on my management server.\n\n21\n00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.960\nShowed you the target server that we're\ngoing to be affecting here as well, and\n\n22\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.306\nnow we're at this place where we're ready\nto generate our very first .mof file,\n\n23\n00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:05.250\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.960\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you where we are.\n\n25\n00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.220\nSo in our previous episode,\n\n26\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.650\nwe were describing essentially some\nof the elements that you need and\n\n27\n00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.300\nonce you're done with this,\nif you use PowerShell ISE to create this\n\n28\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.180\nit's perfectly fine, and it's actually\na good utility for you to use.\n\n29\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.620\nAll you have to do is go\nto File &gt; Save As, and\n\n30\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.660\nonce you do that, you can then make sure\nit actually says PowerShell Files and\n\n31\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.290\nthen name as a .ps1 file at the end,\nthat's all you have to do.\n\n32\n00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.447\nNow I've already done that so\nI'm not renaming it again to help us out.\n\n33\n00:01:36.447 --> 00:01:39.660\nSo in the very end what do I need\nto do if I want to run that?\n\n34\n00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.650\nIf everything is of good syntax we'll\nknow right here in just a moment.\n\n35\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.560\nI'm going to switch directories here,\ngo into my\n\n36\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.960\nDSC directory and\nI'm going to list out the files,\n\n37\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.660\nand the one that I want is going\nto be this one right here.\n\n38\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.270\nSo with the ISE open,\nI have to do a period .\\ and\n\n39\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.464\nthen I’m going to let IntelliSense\nhelp me out just a little bit.\n\n40\n00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:09.070\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n41\n00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.250\n&gt;&gt; By doing that, it saves me time and\n\n42\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.006\nyou don’t have to watch me type,\nwhich is always a plus when that happens.\n\n43\n00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:19.860\nOn that point I just press enter and\nthis is what we were hoping to see.\n\n44\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.774\nNow Cherokee notice the actual-\n&gt;&gt; File extension?\n\n45\n00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:24.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of unusual here.\n\n46\n00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.808\nIt’s actually got two extensions.\n\n47\n00:02:25.808 --> 00:02:31.256\nOne says meta.mof,\nwhenever you see this where says meta.mof,\n\n48\n00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:38.260\nthis is what is going to configure\nthe LCM, the Local Configuration Manager.\n\n49\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.445\nNow you're again like,\ndang that zoomed in pretty good Ronnie.\n\n50\n00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:46.064\nOnce again you have to think at least one\nreason why this is gonna be important and\n\n51\n00:02:46.064 --> 00:02:47.954\nI'm putting it right here on the screen,\n\n52\n00:02:47.954 --> 00:02:50.130\nso I'm hoping that that\nmakes it better point.\n\n53\n00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.882\n&gt;&gt; I think I'm picking up\nwhat you're putting down Ron.\n\n54\n00:02:51.882 --> 00:02:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there alright.\n\n55\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.708\nSo there you go.\n\n56\n00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:58.050\nOkay, so remember,\nLCM when you see meta.mof okay.\n\n57\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.120\nSo that is what is going to configure.\n\n58\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.830\nNow that we have that actually ready\nto go, and we've gone ahead and created\n\n59\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.840\nthis particular file, we now need to send\nthis file over to our target computer\n\n60\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.400\nto configure the local configuration\nmanager on the target computer.\n\n61\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.432\nHope that made sense.\n\n62\n00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:21.281\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n\n63\n00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I see it.\n\n64\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.\nLet's go ahead and see what we can do.\n\n65\n00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.451\nNow remember, that because I ran\nwith this right Cherokee, I said,\n\n66\n00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:34.787\nhey there's two possibilities of\nthe commands that we are gonna use.\n\n67\n00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:36.069\n&gt;&gt; Rstart versus rset?\n\n68\n00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.785\n&gt;&gt; Right so on this one,\ndo you remember which was it's gonna be?\n\n69\n00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.570\n&gt;&gt; We're supposed to use rset\nwith this configuration.\n\n70\n00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.461\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nyes with this particular configuration,\n\n71\n00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.583\nwe are going to use rest here.\n\n72\n00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:52.119\nSo the great thing is that, the white\nspace doesn't really matter right now, so\n\n73\n00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:56.186\nlet me go ahead and type in the command\nhere, Set-Dsc, look at that,\n\n74\n00:03:56.186 --> 00:04:00.260\nit goes in and does that, and\nthere's the IntelliSense information.\n\n75\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.894\nLet me see if I can scroll over so\nyou can see it a little bit better,\n\n76\n00:04:03.894 --> 00:04:06.422\nand that tells you\nthe actual syntax itself.\n\n77\n00:04:06.422 --> 00:04:12.250\nSo, when you start seeing that,\nand you can also do CTRL+Space.\n\n78\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so Ronnie,\n\n79\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.080\nwe haven't actually got to the PowerShell\nportion of this series yet.\n\n80\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.700\nBut what we're seeing here is that\nin IntelliSense, it's intuitive and\n\n81\n00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.720\nit's integrated right here in your\nintegrated scripting environment that\n\n82\n00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.480\nRonnie's using, the ISC or ISC,\nas you may hear it being referenced.\n\n83\n00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n84\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.520\nnow I need to tell it what computer I\nam going to run this against as well.\n\n85\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.451\nI'm gonna do a -ComputerName,\nand then I declared a variable,\n\n86\n00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:42.606\nlet's see what actually came through here,\nComp.\n\n87\n00:04:44.378 --> 00:04:46.620\nAnd if not, I'll have to run it.\n\n88\n00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.691\nOkay, so apparently I have to\nrun that particular out here.\n\n89\n00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:56.690\nSorry, let me go ahead and do that, let\nme verify CompName is what I called it.\n\n90\n00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.230\nNope, so it did not like that, so\nlet me go ahead and set this up here.\n\n91\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.059\nNow I like using variables, and\nthe reason why is cuz I can simply\n\n92\n00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:13.085\nadd in more names in there if I\nchoose to later on for scalability.\n\n93\n00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:18.681\n0365-SRV04, and now let me verify again,\n\n94\n00:05:18.681 --> 00:05:22.724\nand that's what I'm hoping to see.\n\n95\n00:05:22.724 --> 00:05:26.298\nSo now if I do that set-dsc,\nlet me zoom out a little bit.\n\n96\n00:05:26.298 --> 00:05:31.748\nI'm trying not to,\n\n97\n00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.636\ntoo much.\n\n98\n00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:37.260\nHit our ComputerName.\n\n99\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.817\nNow I can call that variable, And\n\n100\n00:05:42.817 --> 00:05:49.728\nthen the path of where that file is\nstored, and that is going to be dsc,\n\n101\n00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:55.115\nzoom out a little bit more so\nthat we can see it, \\lcm,\n\n102\n00:05:55.115 --> 00:06:00.289\nand now you'll see that it\nactually is right there.\n\n103\n00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.804\nSo the great thing,\nIntelliSense has really kind of saved me\n\n104\n00:06:04.804 --> 00:06:09.050\nhaving to type in so\nmuch information it's amazing.\n\n105\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.490\nAll right so now I press enter.\n\n106\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.945\nOops, let me see here.\n\n107\n00:06:14.945 --> 00:06:18.435\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, it looks like we have\nthat actual file there, as well, but\n\n108\n00:06:18.435 --> 00:06:20.459\ndo we just need the path for that syntax?\n\n109\n00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:21.802\nThat may be what's going on.\n\n110\n00:06:21.802 --> 00:06:23.330\n&gt;&gt; I think you're right.\n\n111\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.640\nI think when it comes down to it,\n\n112\n00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.100\nI was kind of a little bit too happy\nabout using IntelliSense here.\n\n113\n00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.160\nSo let me back off of just the actual\nentire file, cuz I don't need that,\n\n114\n00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:41.640\nI just need the path to that file, and\nthen I'm also gonna turn on verbose here.\n\n115\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.310\nSo I always like doing the tab complete as\nwell cuz it puts in the proper syntax and\n\n116\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.070\ncapitalization as everything\nelse goes on here.\n\n117\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.416\nThen I press enter and\nthat is what I'm looking for.\n\n118\n00:06:51.416 --> 00:06:54.286\nSo it was just that, and so\nCherokee, you were right.\n\n119\n00:06:54.286 --> 00:06:56.849\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; The very fact is that I was kind of\n\n120\n00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.001\ngoing a little bit overboard,\nand all I needed was the path.\n\n121\n00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:05.468\nNow, that can also be something that\nyou do see on the exam as well, so\n\n122\n00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:07.330\nbe careful when doing this.\n\n123\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.710\nBut I think if anything, it's gonna\nbe this is probably gonna be the key\n\n124\n00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.070\ninstead of the start DSC\nlocal configuration manager.\n\n125\n00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.190\nSo make sure you take a look at that.\n\n126\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.570\nNow, I want us to take a look,\nwhich I can't say, at the verbose command,\n\n127\n00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.180\nand you'll see something about\nthis set DSC configuration.\n\n128\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.060\nNotice that what it does inside\nis it goes ahead and runs what?\n\n129\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.929\nThe set DSC configuration send\nmeta configuration apply and\n\n130\n00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:39.987\nit tells you exactly what's going on and\nthen right down here,\n\n131\n00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:44.009\nwe're looking at the verbose\noutput right here.\n\n132\n00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:47.779\nSo now an LCM call arrived\nfrom the computer CL02,\n\n133\n00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:51.291\nwhich is the one that I'm\non with the user ID, and\n\n134\n00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:56.704\nthis is what we're looking at and\nwhat we wanna take a look at just briefly.\n\n135\n00:07:56.704 --> 00:08:02.504\nNotice that, here it is,\nthe LCM itself It says hey, I'm gonna run.\n\n136\n00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:06.426\nStart the set and what it starts\nthe set with is by going ahead and\n\n137\n00:08:06.426 --> 00:08:09.090\nstarting the resources that it needs, and\n\n138\n00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.010\nthen the second set here of\nwhatever it actually needs.\n\n139\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.730\nIt ends it when it's actually done and\nit ends the resource and\n\n140\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.350\nthen everything is over, which is fine.\n\n141\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.660\nNotice it did it in about 0.3\nsecond is what it did it in.\n\n142\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:29.426\nSo running that local configuration\nmanger doesn't sound, it's anything but\n\n143\n00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:33.910\nthe whole total here finished in just\na little bit over one second to actually\n\n144\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.430\nconfigured that local\nconfiguration manager.\n\n145\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.210\nSo when we start to see that,\nwhat we're hoping for\n\n146\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:45.510\nthough is that we need to be able\nto verify did this actually run?\n\n147\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.000\nWhat we thought it was going to do?\n\n148\n00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.224\nSo if I now do get-local\nconfiguration manager, and\n\n149\n00:08:52.224 --> 00:08:57.446\nthen tell it I wanna actually\ntake a look at the session\n\n150\n00:08:57.446 --> 00:09:01.974\nthat I've connected to 0365-srv04,\n\n151\n00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:06.502\nwhich I can't do without\nlooking at the screen\n\n152\n00:09:06.502 --> 00:09:10.780\nhere I never know.\n\n153\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.680\nSometimes it requires a single tick mark,\na single quote mark around it.\n\n154\n00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.124\nOkay, there we go, great.\n\n155\n00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:17.828\nAll right, so\n\n156\n00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:22.510\nremember those three elements that I\nactually configured with that file here.\n\n157\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.530\nAllowed the overwrite, that's true.\n\n158\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.950\nAnd the configuration mode is\nexactly what I said it should be and\n\n159\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.550\nthen the final one with the refresh mode.\n\n160\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.070\nMake sure that was changed to push.\n\n161\n00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.540\nAll the other ones that don't have\nanything set, well they're not set but\n\n162\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.090\nnotice the other ones that do have stuff,\nthose are the defaults that are actually\n\n163\n00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:47.080\nput in there and you can see it ran it on\nthe computer that I expect it to run off.\n\n164\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.380\nSo that allows me to know that everything\nis actually good, in the sense\n\n165\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.260\nthat it's over on that particular\ncomputer, and we are ready to go.\n\n166\n00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.960\nSo now, if we go back to what we\nstarted off originally with, and\n\n167\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.930\nlet's do the Get-dsc resource here.\n\n168\n00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:11.060\nThis time, I know I want the name and\nWindowsFeature,\n\n169\n00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:16.953\nthen I do a dollar sign,\nselect dash object.\n\n170\n00:10:16.953 --> 00:10:22.454\nI want to show you all the things\nthat I can actually add in or\n\n171\n00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:25.700\nchange here if I want to.\n\n172\n00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.760\nSo, I want to show you this properties.\n\n173\n00:10:30.654 --> 00:10:32.550\nOops, I gotta spell resource right.\n\n174\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.609\nThere we go a little bit better.\n\n175\n00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:43.974\nAll right, so\nhere all these other things that you have.\n\n176\n00:10:43.974 --> 00:10:47.340\nSo implemented as a PowerShell command.\n\n177\n00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.680\nName, module, version,\nproperties you name it.\n\n178\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.800\nAll of this stuff can\nactually go ahead and\n\n179\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.980\nshow us what we're actually taking\na look at and what we can do.\n\n180\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:04.775\nNow on this command though, even though\nthis is exclusive at the Windows\n\n181\n00:11:04.775 --> 00:11:10.095\nfeature itself, I can also replace\neverything up into properties\n\n182\n00:11:10.095 --> 00:11:15.043\nright here with a dollar,\nnot a dollar sign, a percent sign.\n\n183\n00:11:15.043 --> 00:11:19.730\nAnd that says, do this for\nevery single feature that's also there.\n\n184\n00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.460\nAnd now, notice it actually changes so\n\n185\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.770\nthat we can see this kind of columnar\nformat in terms of the properties.\n\n186\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:32.890\nSo name, the property type isn’t mandatory\nand this is what we want to look for.\n\n187\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.100\nSo I know that if I type\nin the syntax to do this,\n\n188\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.540\neverything else is pretty\nmuch not mandatory.\n\n189\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.350\nThe other thing I’m going to be\nconfiguring here, of course,\n\n190\n00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.600\nis this Ensure.\n\n191\n00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.345\nAnd notice these, actually, two different\nvalues here Absent and Present.\n\n192\n00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:56.080\nAnd this is something we've got to get\nused to actually taking a look at.\n\n193\n00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.380\nPresent means ensure\nthat feature is there.\n\n194\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.640\nAbsent means ensure that it's not there.\n\n195\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.738\nSo that is something else that we also\nwant to make sure that we understand too.\n\n196\n00:12:06.738 --> 00:12:12.335\nNow that we've got pretty much\neverything's set up, as far as the meta\n\n197\n00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:18.230\nMOF actually now configuring\nthe local configuration manager.\n\n198\n00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:23.140\nWe can now go ahead and\nstart that push is what we can do, so\n\n199\n00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.600\nwe are now going to\nstart the configuration.\n\n200\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.487\nIf I type in start-DscConfiguration,\n\n201\n00:12:31.487 --> 00:12:38.826\nthen I tell it the name that I want,\nwhich is Windows, oops.\n\n202\n00:12:42.469 --> 00:12:44.180\nNope, path, sorry.\n\n203\n00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.640\nI was reading the wrong thing here,\nI was going about and\n\n204\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.660\ntyping the same thing again.\n\n205\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.297\nPath\n&gt;&gt; c: and that's under DSC.\n\n206\n00:12:54.297 --> 00:12:54.925\n&gt;&gt; DSC.\n\n207\n00:12:54.925 --> 00:12:56.940\n&gt;&gt; And config.\n\n208\n00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.530\n&gt;&gt; Config.\n\n209\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.450\nNow we haven't talked about\nthis particular config yet so\n\n210\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.000\nlet's take a look at that and\nwhat's actually in there.\n\n211\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.730\nSo this is another one before we kind\nof go a little bit further to show you.\n\n212\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.136\nAnd it's not really that different.\n\n213\n00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:18.095\nThis is gonna produce that MOF file,\nso not meta.mof,\n\n214\n00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:22.655\nthis is what is going to\nconfigure our server 04.\n\n215\n00:13:22.655 --> 00:13:26.655\n&gt;&gt; Would you like in this to maybe\nthe checklist that the system's actually\n\n216\n00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:30.145\nusing to make sure hey this is exactly\nhow it should be configured and\n\n217\n00:13:30.145 --> 00:13:34.315\nit runs through this information right\nhere to kind of compare and verify?\n\n218\n00:13:34.315 --> 00:13:37.505\n&gt;&gt; Right, yep,\nthat's exactly what it ends up doing.\n\n219\n00:13:37.505 --> 00:13:40.465\nSo notice that we're actually gonna\nsee the word Configuration and\n\n220\n00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:42.130\nthen we create a name.\n\n221\n00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.620\nYou can name it whatever you want to,\nokay?\n\n222\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.727\nIf you put dashes and stuff in it,\n\n223\n00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:51.411\nyou'll probably have to put single\nquote marks around it but there it is.\n\n224\n00:13:51.411 --> 00:13:53.918\nI also created this\nvariable with the name,\n\n225\n00:13:53.918 --> 00:13:57.590\nagain I like the variable because\nI can add in another computer.\n\n226\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:02.940\nIf I add in 040506 I have to go back and\nrechange everything.\n\n227\n00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.610\nI just go ahead, and\nadd their name in here, instead.\n\n228\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.440\nNode and then the Windows features.\n\n229\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.070\nNotice again the set of\nbrackets is kind of key.\n\n230\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.350\nMake sure you do have them matching\nat the layers that you want to.\n\n231\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.510\nYou have multiple features.\n\n232\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.410\nFor example, I know for\n\n233\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:24.180\nthese features to be gone,\nthose are the two that I need, okay?\n\n234\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.207\nThe server dash gui mgmt\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and those look familiar, right?\n\n235\n00:14:28.207 --> 00:14:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and so yeah from the\n&gt;&gt; Other shows right?\n\n236\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.220\n&gt;&gt; From the show, that's right.\n\n237\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.560\nAnd then the ensure here is either\ngoing to be absent or present, okay?\n\n238\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.910\nNow the reason why this\nis very important for\n\n239\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.610\nwhat we are doing here is because\nyou want to make sure, and\n\n240\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:49.160\nalso, this ties into the apply and\nmonitor as well.\n\n241\n00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.850\nAnd the reason why, is that a lot of\ntimes, in the way that we want this, and\n\n242\n00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.030\nwhat we want to do,\nis we want to correct issues.\n\n243\n00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.500\nAnd the way that you do\nthat is by monitoring and\n\n244\n00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.360\nrealizing, Cherokee is the one that's\nbeen logging on trying to change stuff.\n\n245\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.367\nSo if that happens, right,\nwell it's not a whoops.\n\n246\n00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:13.160\nAs much as Cherokee,\nthis is not how we do this now, right?\n\n247\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.210\nIf we're gonna do this we're\ngonna run it through DSC.\n\n248\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.700\nSo part of that process if\nwe just do the auto-correct,\n\n249\n00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.920\nCherokee doesn't know she's\nreally doing anything wrong.\n\n250\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.780\nHeck, I don't know that\nCherokee's doing anything wrong.\n\n251\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.260\nBut now it gives me that chance\nto go back and check the log and\n\n252\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:32.130\ngo over to Cherokee and go,\nCherokee here's what we'll do instead.\n\n253\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.720\nSo we don't really want you\nlogging into the machine.\n\n254\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.810\nWe've got them set\nthe way that we need to.\n\n255\n00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.800\nIf you need to make the change,\nlet's make it through DSC and\n\n256\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.700\nthat way we'll make sure that everything\nhappens the way that we want to.\n\n257\n00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.526\nSame thing here with the idea of ensuring.\n\n258\n00:15:47.526 --> 00:15:52.702\nIt's not about me configuring it and\nsaying enable this thing or fix it.\n\n259\n00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:58.059\nIt's just checking to say if it's there,\nfine, ensure that it's there.\n\n260\n00:15:58.059 --> 00:16:01.901\nIf I want to ensure that it's not there,\nI just tell it, ensure that it's absent.\n\n261\n00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:05.860\nIn other words, that configuration\nis not going to be there anymore.\n\n262\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.780\nSo that's all that we're doing,\nright here.\n\n263\n00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.680\nAnd then at the end, I have the variable\nthat I actually created here,\n\n264\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.570\nas well as it's going to produce\nthis particular file that I need.\n\n265\n00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.570\nNow, that's actually gonna\nbe very important, and\n\n266\n00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.170\nit is a step that I might\nhave to go back in on.\n\n267\n00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.630\nNo, actually it did run that.\n\n268\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.030\nSo, it is sitting, let me verify.\n\n269\n00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.080\nNo, I actually need to run it.\n\n270\n00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:36.560\nSo I was trying to make sure that [LAUGH]\nThat it produced what it need to.\n\n271\n00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.870\nOkay, so it is there.\n\n272\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.260\nI just want to make sure, before I went\non, I was like I'm about to run this and\n\n273\n00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.890\nit's not gonna be there.\n\n274\n00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.310\nSo here we go, so the great thing is,\nit's actually already there.\n\n275\n00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.250\nSo you would run this\njust like what we did,\n\n276\n00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.930\nwe would take the name of that ps1 file,\nand then go ahead and run it.\n\n277\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.310\nAnd that should create the file\nof where it needs to be,\n\n278\n00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.410\nwhich is where I already told it to be.\n\n279\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.650\nSo it should be in that config folder.\n\n280\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.940\nSo now that it's there,\nI now tell it to go to the computer name.\n\n281\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.780\nNow, Cherokee makes a point, what if your\n\n282\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.740\nvariable doesn't have the computer name\nthat you want it, well that's easy enough.\n\n283\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:19.680\nIf you don't want it to be there,\nall you have to do is say, hey I want\n\n284\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:25.471\nthis to be on O365-srv04.\n\n285\n00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:35.200\nThen we're gonna tell it to run this,\nWith, oops, what did I miss here?\n\n286\n00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:43.708\nLooking for something.\n\n287\n00:17:47.939 --> 00:17:48.957\n&gt;&gt; For both, and then -wait.\n\n288\n00:17:48.957 --> 00:17:53.051\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm just,\n\n289\n00:17:53.051 --> 00:17:58.299\nSomething else is, I'm running\nin the wrong place, that's why.\n\n290\n00:17:58.299 --> 00:17:59.413\n[LAUGH] That's me.\n\n291\n00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:00.601\nGuess what?\n\n292\n00:18:06.027 --> 00:18:07.881\nHold on.\n\n293\n00:18:07.881 --> 00:18:09.120\nGive me a second here.\n\n294\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.170\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n295\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.720\n&gt;&gt; That was,\nI was typing in the wrong place.\n\n296\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.660\nI was like why is that not\nactually even filling up?\n\n297\n00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.630\nIt's because I'm supposed to be\ntyping down here in the blue window.\n\n298\n00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.380\nThat's what I get, I didn't actually need\nto be messing with that up there at all.\n\n299\n00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.090\nThat was my fault, completely, 100% mine.\n\n300\n00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:28.560\nI was like, this is not actually filling\nin or doing anything that I need to do.\n\n301\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.840\nSo now let's take a look\nat the difference here.\n\n302\n00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.845\nSo I do ComputerName, and\nthen in here I can do.\n\n303\n00:18:37.845 --> 00:18:39.185\nI was really starting to get worried.\n\n304\n00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:40.847\nI was like, I broke something, and\n\n305\n00:18:40.847 --> 00:18:43.654\nI didn't even realize how I\ncould have actually broken it.\n\n306\n00:18:43.654 --> 00:18:50.457\n365-srv04.\n\n307\n00:18:50.457 --> 00:18:53.670\nAnd then we're going to do,\nthere we go, see, verbose.\n\n308\n00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.162\nLook, that actually shows up.\n\n309\n00:18:55.162 --> 00:18:55.927\nI was like, wow!\n\n310\n00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.582\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Isn't it amazing how things\nwork the way you want it to do when you\n\n311\n00:18:58.582 --> 00:18:59.488\ndo them right, right?\n\n312\n00:18:59.488 --> 00:19:03.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet me go ahead and run this here.\n\n313\n00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.117\nNow when I start doing this,\nthis is going to take a few minutes.\n\n314\n00:19:08.117 --> 00:19:10.947\nBut I wanted to explain\nto you something that\n\n315\n00:19:10.947 --> 00:19:15.780\nyou did end up seeing which was that term,\nwait, at the end, and verbose.\n\n316\n00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.344\nIf you don't do verbose and you don't\ndo wait, it's gonna just run, and\n\n317\n00:19:19.344 --> 00:19:21.142\nyou're just gonna see it sit there.\n\n318\n00:19:21.142 --> 00:19:24.340\nIt's not going to show\nyou any output at all.\n\n319\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.920\nSo that's normally what we want.\n\n320\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.980\nThat's usually pretty darned good\nwhen we have something like that.\n\n321\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.610\nAnd it doesn't show us\nanything else that we want.\n\n322\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.180\nBut when we're running verbose,\nwe get the output, okay.\n\n323\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.410\nBut if I also don't include wait, it runs\nit instantaneously in the background,\n\n324\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.520\nand you're still not going to know.\n\n325\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.176\nBy telling it to wait,\nit is actually going to give us both\n\n326\n00:19:46.176 --> 00:19:50.597\nwhere it actually allows us to see\neverything that comes along here,\n\n327\n00:19:50.597 --> 00:19:53.438\nsees what we're actually ending up doing.\n\n328\n00:19:53.438 --> 00:19:54.897\nNow, you'll see that it's at 57%.\n\n329\n00:19:54.897 --> 00:19:57.830\nIt's probably going to take seven or\neight minutes.\n\n330\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:02.920\nBut, let's talk about this before\nwe'll use as much time as we can,\n\n331\n00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.010\nand then, we might have to take\na little TV magic timeout here,\n\n332\n00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.890\nto not bore everyone to death watching\na green bar go across the screen.\n\n333\n00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:15.250\nSo notice once again, we're not really\nworried about reading this, okay?\n\n334\n00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.560\nI'm not even worried about showing,\nnotice I didn't show you a MOFA.\n\n335\n00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.703\nI didn't show you all\nthe stuff inside MOFA.\n\n336\n00:20:19.703 --> 00:20:21.840\nYou don't have to actually\nknow how to read that.\n\n337\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.940\nYou don't have to really\nknow how to read this.\n\n338\n00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.510\nBut it helps in understanding\nthe logic behind this as you do.\n\n339\n00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.960\nSo just like what we looked at before,\nnotice the Start Set,\n\n340\n00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.970\nthe Resource here,\nthat's it's actually starting up,\n\n341\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.760\nand then it begins the Test against\nthe file that we told it to run.\n\n342\n00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.620\nNotice right here the operation, okay?\n\n343\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.270\nStarted it, started it, which is fine.\n\n344\n00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.900\nIt ended the Test in about seven seconds,\n\n345\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.850\nthey'll realize that they both were on,\nokay?\n\n346\n00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.740\nThen it started the Set.\n\n347\n00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.400\nWhat's a Set?\n\n348\n00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.100\nIt's what we showed you in the\nconfiguration file that I just showed you\n\n349\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.720\nright up here, at the very top,\nright where you saw the words absent.\n\n350\n00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.630\nSo right now, you're seeing where it says,\nUninstallation started.\n\n351\n00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.480\nContinued, and\nnow it's beginning to process.\n\n352\n00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.380\nSo Prerequisite started,\nPrerequisite process succeeded, and\n\n353\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.990\nit's just gonna continue on through\nuntil the end that it's done.\n\n354\n00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:29.954\nSo right now, you and I are never gonna\nsee anything going on here on server 04.\n\n355\n00:21:29.954 --> 00:21:31.283\nWe're gonna leave it alone,\n\n356\n00:21:31.283 --> 00:21:34.200\nlet it actually do it's thing\nwithout having to worry about it.\n\n357\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.010\nBut it is gonna take a few minutes.\n\n358\n00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.460\nSo Cherokee, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n359\n00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.630\nWe'll take in the magic\nof a TV timeout here.\n\n360\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.650\nAnd then we'll come back when\nit's actually complete and\n\n361\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.820\nwe'll show you the rest of\nthe process from there.\n\n362\n00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:46.905\nAll right, there you go.\n\n363\n00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:51.195\nWe are now with that magic of no time at\nall as far as what you're actually seeing\n\n364\n00:21:51.195 --> 00:21:52.320\nright there.\n\n365\n00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.420\nWe're ready to continue on.\n\n366\n00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.370\nSo let's take a look at my machine.\n\n367\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.980\nAnd you'll see that it\nactually did finish here.\n\n368\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.570\nNow at the end, there's a couple of things\nI do need to take care of cuz I was kind\n\n369\n00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.860\nof in a little bit of a hurry.\n\n370\n00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:08.430\nIt tells me that, hey I must restart\nthis to finish the removal process.\n\n371\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.930\nDuring that time out once it actually\nrestarts, let me go ahead and\n\n372\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.970\nrestart this so we'll kind of\nspeed up the show a little bit.\n\n373\n00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.280\nSo it's rebooting right now as we talk.\n\n374\n00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.284\nBut notice that it did take some\ntime to actually finish it.\n\n375\n00:22:20.284 --> 00:22:24.080\nSo it took about 421 seconds.\n\n376\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.250\nYou take 60 and\n\n377\n00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.870\nyou do that it's about 7 minutes is\nwhat it actually ended up taking.\n\n378\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.924\nAnd the unusual thing about this\nCherokee is that even though it says,\n\n379\n00:22:32.924 --> 00:22:35.130\nit did all this in about seven minutes.\n\n380\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.820\nSo the time taken to complete\nthe configuration job was actually less.\n\n381\n00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.129\nI don't know how that happened,\nbut there you go.\n\n382\n00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:44.202\n&gt;&gt; 319 seconds.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so about six minutes and\n\n383\n00:22:44.202 --> 00:22:45.980\nsome change, right?\n\n384\n00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.088\nSo it took about a minute longer\nto actually finish up everything.\n\n385\n00:22:49.088 --> 00:22:54.388\nNow, Cherokee,if I run this again.\n\n386\n00:22:54.388 --> 00:22:58.670\nNo, what do you think is gonna happen?\n\n387\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.910\nYou think it's gonna take\nus another seven minutes?\n\n388\n00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:06.270\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, because if you don't have\nany changes that it needs to go ahead and\n\n389\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.300\ninitiate or that it's looking for,\n\n390\n00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.480\nthere's no differential information\nis what I'm trying to say here.\n\n391\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n392\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.460\nYeah, the weird thing is that when we\nrun stuff like this normally, right?\n\n393\n00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.990\nIf you install a service and\nyou tried to install it again,\n\n394\n00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.280\nyou normally get an error telling\nyou something has been done.\n\n395\n00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.230\nSomething has been done that way or\n\n396\n00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.200\nyou'll get something that\ncauses some unusual thing.\n\n397\n00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.856\nThe reason I wanna mention this is that\nthere's a weird word that's associated\n\n398\n00:23:31.856 --> 00:23:33.177\nwith the way that DSC works.\n\n399\n00:23:33.177 --> 00:23:35.716\nLet's call it idempotent.\n\n400\n00:23:35.716 --> 00:23:36.823\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n401\n00:23:36.823 --> 00:23:40.798\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I-D-E-M-P-O-T-E-N-T.\n\n402\n00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:43.038\nEver heard of that word?\n\n403\n00:23:43.038 --> 00:23:43.913\n&gt;&gt; I have not.\n\n404\n00:23:43.913 --> 00:23:45.352\nI'm interested right now.\n\n405\n00:23:45.352 --> 00:23:49.038\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden I was like,\nokay, I gotta look that one up.\n\n406\n00:23:49.038 --> 00:23:52.684\nEven after looking it up I still\ndon't understand, so I went and\n\n407\n00:23:52.684 --> 00:23:55.329\nasked out resident mathematician, Justin.\n\n408\n00:23:55.329 --> 00:23:58.602\nAnd he said, well,\nwhat is pretty much means is that if\n\n409\n00:23:58.602 --> 00:24:02.954\nyou keep running it It'll actually\ngive you the same result every time.\n\n410\n00:24:02.954 --> 00:24:06.566\nWell, DSC, and what we're actually doing\nright here it'll give you the same result\n\n411\n00:24:06.566 --> 00:24:08.032\nit's not gonna cause any issues.\n\n412\n00:24:08.032 --> 00:24:10.960\nSo the reason why it said it's checking,\nright it says,\n\n413\n00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.930\nif that configuration is what it\nis it's not gonna do anything.\n\n414\n00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.081\nSo it'll actually give you that same\nresult that it ran the first time.\n\n415\n00:24:18.081 --> 00:24:21.820\nBut the first time you ran it and changed\nsomething and now, if you change it again,\n\n416\n00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.148\nit says what, I'm gonna give you same\nresult as what I ran the first time.\n\n417\n00:24:25.148 --> 00:24:26.469\nSo that's that idea,\n\n418\n00:24:26.469 --> 00:24:30.652\nnow let's take a look at what happens\nhere when I press Enter this time.\n\n419\n00:24:30.652 --> 00:24:34.292\nAnd now look Cherokee,\nnot only did it not take seven minutes,\n\n420\n00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:36.153\nit barely took a second, okay.\n\n421\n00:24:36.153 --> 00:24:38.020\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool,\nyeah there's nothing to change there.\n\n422\n00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.000\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, nothing to change is\nactually what we end up seeing here.\n\n423\n00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.260\n&gt;&gt; So now that everything is done,\nif I now go over to SRV 04,\n\n424\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.480\nhopefully this reboot has\nactually happened here.\n\n425\n00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.360\nAnd now,\nlet's say Cherokee logs in see Boose.\n\n426\n00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.060\n&gt;&gt; And what we're testing here is,\nbecause originally I had messed things up.\n\n427\n00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.160\nI had made this machine\na graphical user interface style.\n\n428\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.064\nAnd with our desired state\nconfiguration that you ran,\n\n429\n00:25:05.064 --> 00:25:08.707\nyou're saying hey, no this machine\nis supposed to be a core install,\n\n430\n00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:12.384\nso you took those two components out,\nand that's what we should see.\n\n431\n00:25:12.384 --> 00:25:12.967\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n432\n00:25:12.967 --> 00:25:16.511\nSo, Cherokee,\nthis is all that is pretty much left for\n\n433\n00:25:16.511 --> 00:25:21.997\nwhat we have available to us right here,\nand that's what you're actually seeing.\n\n434\n00:25:21.997 --> 00:25:25.528\nSo no longer do I have the server manager.\n\n435\n00:25:25.528 --> 00:25:28.170\nI couldn't remember what it was called.\n\n436\n00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.440\nThe server manager isn't there anymore.\n\n437\n00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.344\nYou're just left with this right here.\n\n438\n00:25:32.344 --> 00:25:37.595\nNow, if Cherokee wanted to,\nand she said, look,\n\n439\n00:25:37.595 --> 00:25:43.595\nI am better I can do this and\nshe wanted to run that, right.\n\n440\n00:25:43.595 --> 00:25:48.356\nShe got into PowerShell and\nshe decided to install Windows,\n\n441\n00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.987\nFeature okay, and\nhe decided to do this right and\n\n442\n00:25:55.987 --> 00:25:59.625\ntake the I can't what\nthe name of it is but\n\n443\n00:25:59.625 --> 00:26:03.714\nthose server -GUI info-\n&gt;&gt; Yes the info management and then\n\n444\n00:26:03.714 --> 00:26:08.065\nthe server Shell command line let's say\nlike we saw that we use in other shows.\n\n445\n00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Right so she said this I'll\nget these things right back.\n\n446\n00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.960\nWell she could possible do so.\n\n447\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.769\nOnly if,\nright she knows how to make sure, so\n\n448\n00:26:19.769 --> 00:26:24.274\nshe want to get windowsfeature.\n\n449\n00:26:24.274 --> 00:26:25.920\nWe'll see here, ton of them.\n\n450\n00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.197\nLet me see if I can\nscroll down there it is.\n\n451\n00:26:29.197 --> 00:26:33.260\nSo now notice that there's just these\ntwo and they're actually unchecked.\n\n452\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.720\nBut they're also still there, okay?\n\n453\n00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.990\nSo at this point,\n\n454\n00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.210\nunlike when you actually install Server\nby itself in the Server Core Edition,\n\n455\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.720\nwhere the elements are removed,\nthey're actually still available.\n\n456\n00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.068\nNow unless I actually went ahead and\nsaid during that configuration\n\n457\n00:26:51.068 --> 00:26:54.738\nstate to say look go ahead and\nremove those features too.\n\n458\n00:26:54.738 --> 00:26:55.702\n&gt;&gt; Remove those as well.\n\n459\n00:26:55.702 --> 00:26:58.071\n&gt;&gt; Then now I should have to\nalso present the source files-\n\n460\n00:26:58.071 --> 00:26:58.979\n&gt;&gt; Source files, yeah.\n\n461\n00:26:58.979 --> 00:27:00.890\n&gt;&gt; And all that stuff to bring it back in.\n\n462\n00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.550\nBut you kind of get the idea here, okay.\n\n463\n00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:07.380\nThat this can actually be\ndone very easily okay.\n\n464\n00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.248\nSo let's see, install.\n\n465\n00:27:11.248 --> 00:27:15.528\nWindows feature, and\nwhat was it called here?\n\n466\n00:27:15.528 --> 00:27:19.037\nIt was called, I should have actually.\n\n467\n00:27:19.037 --> 00:27:19.641\n&gt;&gt; Looked at those?\n\n468\n00:27:19.641 --> 00:27:20.462\nYes so.\n\n469\n00:27:20.462 --> 00:27:24.005\n&gt;&gt; Server,\nlet's just do the GUI shell I think.\n\n470\n00:27:24.005 --> 00:27:28.992\n&gt;&gt; Server-guimanagement-infra and\nthen the server-guishell, yes.\n\n471\n00:27:28.992 --> 00:27:33.894\n&gt;&gt; Server-gui-mgmt.\n\n472\n00:27:33.894 --> 00:27:37.853\n&gt;&gt; INFRA comma space.\n\n473\n00:27:37.853 --> 00:27:38.756\n&gt;&gt; And then server.\n\n474\n00:27:38.756 --> 00:27:41.625\n&gt;&gt; -gui-shell.\n\n475\n00:27:41.625 --> 00:27:42.729\n&gt;&gt; -shell.\n\n476\n00:27:42.729 --> 00:27:45.268\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n477\n00:27:45.268 --> 00:27:49.859\n&gt;&gt; And then computer name, and for\n\n478\n00:27:49.859 --> 00:27:55.142\nus that would be 0365-STRO4.\n\n479\n00:27:55.142 --> 00:27:59.386\n&gt;&gt; SRO4.\n\n480\n00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:02.075\n&gt;&gt; SRV\n&gt;&gt; SRV.\n\n481\n00:28:04.542 --> 00:28:07.317\nAnd now it's going to try and\nrun through and\n\n482\n00:28:07.317 --> 00:28:11.228\nlet me log out of this thing\nbefore it actually goes nuts here.\n\n483\n00:28:11.228 --> 00:28:13.647\nCuz it's probably gonna say that.\n\n484\n00:28:13.647 --> 00:28:17.779\nSo in this sense, right, everything should\nask you what end up working and what we're\n\n485\n00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:22.160\ngonna see here in just a little bit as you\nactually start seeing the installation.\n\n486\n00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.960\nIt's gonna uninstall but it also is gonna\nend up seeing something because we chose\n\n487\n00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.200\nthat apply and autocorrect, it's gonna fix\nit, okay is what's gonna end up happening.\n\n488\n00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.644\nSo we'll actually take just another\nbrief TV timeout, and watch for\n\n489\n00:28:36.644 --> 00:28:38.799\nthe results here at the end here.\n\n490\n00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:41.660\nSo just give us another moment here and\nwe'll be right back.\n\n491\n00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.880\nAll right so we're now ready to see if\nCherokee has successfully bypassed my\n\n492\n00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.280\ndesired state configuration here.\n\n493\n00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.380\nSo let's take a look at the screen and\n\n494\n00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.700\nwe'll see the results\nhere at the very end.\n\n495\n00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.990\nAccording to what I saw right here, right?\n\n496\n00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.711\nIf she ran it, it says true, yes, success.\n\n497\n00:28:59.711 --> 00:29:00.910\nAnd now, there it is.\n\n498\n00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.732\nThe graphical management tools and\ninfrastructure,\n\n499\n00:29:03.732 --> 00:29:05.394\nall that has been added back in.\n\n500\n00:29:05.394 --> 00:29:08.850\nNow notice it says that there's\nrestarts here that had to happen.\n\n501\n00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.421\nAnd this is where you have\nto be a little bit patient.\n\n502\n00:29:11.421 --> 00:29:14.644\nAnd you may actually see that\nit's gonna take a few restarts\n\n503\n00:29:14.644 --> 00:29:16.266\nbefore it actually happens.\n\n504\n00:29:16.266 --> 00:29:18.998\nSo, it did have to kind\nof install the tools, and\n\n505\n00:29:18.998 --> 00:29:22.878\nthen it had uninstall the tools,\nand had to kinda to fix everything.\n\n506\n00:29:22.878 --> 00:29:26.709\nBut, it will actually end\nup happening that way, and\n\n507\n00:29:26.709 --> 00:29:29.699\nwe'll end up seeing that, as well okay.\n\n508\n00:29:29.699 --> 00:29:31.650\nSo, now that, that is done okay.\n\n509\n00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.665\nIt's the time to actually test this out.\n\n510\n00:29:34.665 --> 00:29:38.668\nSo we can go over to here to SRV04.\n\n511\n00:29:38.668 --> 00:29:41.089\nAnd I can even already see this, Cherokee,\n\n512\n00:29:41.089 --> 00:29:44.895\nlook at the way that the screen looks\nmuch more plain than what we see.\n\n513\n00:29:44.895 --> 00:29:46.720\nBut we'll see here okay.\n\n514\n00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.350\nSo let me select your icon, and\nnothing's even appearing as the graphic.\n\n515\n00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:56.427\nSo to me that's actually a good indication\nthat everything is actually working here.\n\n516\n00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:01.636\nAnd let's see, there it is, Cherokee!\n\n517\n00:30:01.636 --> 00:30:05.465\n&gt;&gt; I couldn't thwart your evil policies!\n\n518\n00:30:05.465 --> 00:30:09.013\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the Desired State Configuration does\n\n519\n00:30:09.013 --> 00:30:10.470\nwork for us.\n\n520\n00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.894\nNow something like this is\na bit more complex, because\n\n521\n00:30:13.894 --> 00:30:18.817\nI did tell it to remove a roll-in feature\nand I actually told her to remove two.\n\n522\n00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:22.051\nSo if I was smarter,\na smarter man would have actually said\n\n523\n00:30:22.051 --> 00:30:25.417\nlet's just remove one thing\ninstead of actually doing two.\n\n524\n00:30:25.417 --> 00:30:28.336\nIt might have actually kind of\nbeen a little bit quicker and\n\n525\n00:30:28.336 --> 00:30:29.834\neverything that it had to do.\n\n526\n00:30:29.834 --> 00:30:31.990\nBut it still carried\nthrough it's still able to-\n\n527\n00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.295\n&gt;&gt; Still able to cross yes.\n\n528\n00:30:34.295 --> 00:30:35.300\n&gt;&gt; Yup, to help us out.\n\n529\n00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.407\nSo you will now see that a push type of\nconfiguration setting fairly easy and\n\n530\n00:30:40.407 --> 00:30:41.390\nsuccessful.\n\n531\n00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:42.812\nNow you're saying, easy?\n\n532\n00:30:42.812 --> 00:30:47.271\nWell, by comparison remember I can\nrun this against 10 computers,\n\n533\n00:30:47.271 --> 00:30:50.381\n20 computers, 100 computers if I need to.\n\n534\n00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:53.370\nAnd it will do the same thing and\nkeep that desired state.\n\n535\n00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.250\nIf you do something like that though\nideally you would use the pull\n\n536\n00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.200\nmethod instead.\n\n537\n00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.671\nAnd then you'd have to\nset up a little bit more.\n\n538\n00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:03.456\nBut the concept and\nthe idea is pretty much the same and\n\n539\n00:31:03.456 --> 00:31:06.074\nyou got to see that here in this show.\n\n540\n00:31:06.074 --> 00:31:08.440\nSo don't overlook this process.\n\n541\n00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.565\nMake sure you always think about scenarios\nin which it would be good to use desired\n\n542\n00:31:12.565 --> 00:31:15.979\nstate configuration,\nbecause you're gonna see it from here on.\n\n543\n00:31:15.979 --> 00:31:20.352\nAnd, probably all the way though until\nthe time when Windows Server is no longer\n\n544\n00:31:20.352 --> 00:31:21.992\nactually out there anymore.\n\n545\n00:31:21.992 --> 00:31:26.978\n&gt;&gt; Very true, Ronnie, I think just this\npast week Microsoft officially announced\n\n546\n00:31:26.978 --> 00:31:32.500\nthe deprecation of what, SCM, so Security\nCompliance Manager, I think is the, yeah.\n\n547\n00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.121\nSo that tool is not\nbeing supported anymore.\n\n548\n00:31:35.121 --> 00:31:40.190\nSo you're gonna see DSC really step up\nto the plate and fill in for SCM, there.\n\n549\n00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.477\nSo pretty cool good stuff to know.\n\n550\n00:31:42.477 --> 00:31:45.850\nIt was a little bit of a journey here,\nthree episodes but we made it.\n\n551\n00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.312\nSo thank you for your time Ronnie,\nI surely appreciate that, and I appreciate\n\n552\n00:31:49.312 --> 00:31:53.270\nyou being here as well, but stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n553\n00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.784\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n554\n00:31:54.784 --> 00:31:57.730\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boise,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n555\n00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.600\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n556\n00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:05.927\n[MUSIC]\n\n557\n00:32:05.927

another,\ngreat episode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:19.114\nYou're watching, the MCSA,\nfor Windows Server 2012.\n\n8\n00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:24.042\nSpecifically taking a look at exam 70-410,\nand I'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\n\n9\n00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:28.294\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look and\ndiving into NIC Teaming, and here to\n\n10\n00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:32.849\nhelp us to understand the concept of\nNIC Teaming better is Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:34.540\nCherokee, welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.622\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie,\nhow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:36.581\n&gt;&gt; It is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:41.443\nNow, Cherokee we're now going into the\nrealm here of talking about the idea of\n\n15\n00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:42.338\nNIC Teaming.\n\n16\n00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:47.240\nFirst, explain to us why do we, what it\nis, and then of course, why do we care?\n\n17\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so NIC Teaming is the ability\nto make more than one network\n\n18\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.705\ninterface card and go ahead and\nuse it for a couple of different reasons.\n\n19\n00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:59.406\nYou have the option to go ahead and\naggregate band with and or\n\n20\n00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:03.342\nyou can utilize it for\nany kind of redundancy fault tolerance.\n\n21\n00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:06.325\nAs a matter of fact,\nit goes by several different names.\n\n22\n00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:10.245\nYou may even hear it being\nreferenced as bandwidth aggregation,\n\n23\n00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:14.795\nlink aggregation, NIC bonding,\nNIC teaming, I'm trying to think,\n\n24\n00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.180\nbut that's essentially what\nwe'll be looking at here today.\n\n25\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.318\nAll right, so Cherokee what is the main\ngoal behind doing something like that?\n\n26\n00:01:21.318 --> 00:01:25.047\nSo why would I care about bonding the NICs\ntogether or aggregating the bandwidth?\n\n27\n00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:26.241\nWhy is that so important?\n\n28\n00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.826\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwe have a lot of flexibility here.\n\n29\n00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:33.118\nWe have the ability to use up\nto 32 network interface cards-\n\n30\n00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:33.720\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go.\n\n31\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.624\n&gt;&gt; With a physical machine.\n\n32\n00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:39.048\nSo if you think about that for a second\nRonnie, if we have like 1 gigabit per\n\n33\n00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:42.351\nsecond network interface cards,\nif I can aggregate and\n\n34\n00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:46.352\nbond them together to work as a unit or\nto work as a team essentially,\n\n35\n00:01:46.352 --> 00:01:50.872\ntheoretically I could have,\nin that situation, a 32 gigabit pipeline.\n\n36\n00:01:50.872 --> 00:01:54.695\nSo my system will see and\nrecognize that link as 32 gigs,\n\n37\n00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:56.810\ninstead of just having one gig.\n\n38\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.630\nSo you could use that for a benefit of\nhaving increased speeds and bandwidth,\n\n39\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.601\nhowever, you can also set it even in a\nmore simplistic fashion where we just have\n\n40\n00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:11.230\none extra network interface card using\nit as a backup or standby adapter.\n\n41\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.608\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent options here.\n\n42\n00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:16.840\nAs a matter of fact,\nyou have so many options.\n\n43\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.031\nI found a book for you.\n\n44\n00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:21.609\nIt is through Microsoft,\nif we take a look my screen right here,\n\n45\n00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.410\nthere's a link in the show notes, and\nthey even have two separate books for you.\n\n46\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.814\nThey're really just Word documents,\nbut you can see here,\n\n47\n00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:34.621\nthere's a Windows Server 2012 R2 Version,\na guide to go ahead and explain, and\n\n48\n00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:39.359\nthen also a 2012 version, and I would\nhighly encourage you, if you plan on using\n\n49\n00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.833\nNIC teaming in your environment to go\nthrough their really helpful documents,\n\n50\n00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:48.974\nand so I have the 2012 version pulled up,\n2012 R2 version pulled up right here that\n\n51\n00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:53.968\nwe're looking at, and so throughout this\nshow I'll be referencing revision 2 here.\n\n52\n00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:58.406\nSo just to give you an idea, and you can\nsee they go ahead and outline it, and\n\n53\n00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:02.916\non the left hand column this is just\na table of contents and everything over on\n\n54\n00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:06.745\nthe left hand side and you can see\nthat there is really a lot to it.\n\n55\n00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:10.971\nSo I'll be introducing you to these topics\nbut if you are working in a production\n\n56\n00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:14.819\nenvironment I would definitely\nencourage you, if you're using some of\n\n57\n00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.667\nthe fringe configurations,\nthe really specific ones, you might wanna\n\n58\n00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:22.733\nspend a little extra time to really dive\nin there and get all the details out.\n\n59\n00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:27.571\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, actually taking a look\nat that list that you see right there\n\n60\n00:03:27.571 --> 00:03:31.083\nwhere it says,\nwhat this guide actually addresses,\n\n61\n00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:36.154\none of the key points that as you see is\nlike that third bullet point I believe,\n\n62\n00:03:36.154 --> 00:03:40.787\nwhich is also the idea of fail over\nalgorithms that you actually have.\n\n63\n00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:43.506\nSo underneath that where it says\nthe following section addresses.\n\n64\n00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that third one, so\n\n65\n00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:49.101\nnot only can we use it of course to\naggregate bandwidth, but for fail over,\n\n66\n00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:53.332\nand that might be something that if we're\njust really coming into the MCSA and\n\n67\n00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:57.824\ntrying to figure out why this is actually\nimportant, failover is a big one because\n\n68\n00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:01.858\nit can be where you end up buying a single\nserver, and the NIC goes bad, and\n\n69\n00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:05.101\nhow does this NIC teaming help\nus out on that one Cherokee?\n\n70\n00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:08.058\n&gt;&gt; So what we're trying to do is\neliminate single points of failure.\n\n71\n00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:12.384\nSo by introducing multiple network\ninterface card you're adding additional\n\n72\n00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:13.045\nhardware.\n\n73\n00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:16.793\nSo as we go through, and I have some\ndiagrams that I want to show you, we\n\n74\n00:04:16.793 --> 00:04:21.372\nshould also be aware of additional single\npoints of failure because that's really,\n\n75\n00:04:21.372 --> 00:04:22.152\nthe endgame.\n\n76\n00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:24.908\nWe're trying to reduce\nthose points of failure so\n\n77\n00:04:24.908 --> 00:04:27.080\nwe can maintain business continuity.\n\n78\n00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.634\nWe don't have any downtime,\n\n79\n00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:33.051\nespecially if we're in an environment,\nthey're talking high availability, and\n\n80\n00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:36.677\nsome of these configurations\nare exactly what that is designed for.\n\n81\n00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:39.182\nSome of those fringed ones\nI was talking about for\n\n82\n00:04:39.182 --> 00:04:43.104\nreally large enterprise environments that,\nyou may or may not encounter.\n\n83\n00:04:43.104 --> 00:04:45.833\nA lot of companies may not\nhave the need for that, but\n\n84\n00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:48.007\nwhen we're talking high availability,\n\n85\n00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:52.292\nthis is extremely important when we're\ntalking about having that hardware up and\n\n86\n00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:56.514\nrunning, we can't afford time to have\nCherokee go run to the hardware closet and\n\n87\n00:04:56.514 --> 00:04:59.405\ngrab a different work interface card,\nswitch it out.\n\n88\n00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:02.754\nThat's just not acceptable in today's age.\n\n89\n00:05:02.754 --> 00:05:06.930\nSo yeah,\nwe'll talk about those algorithms also.\n\n90\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.580\nThat's a little more involved,\na little more in depth.\n\n91\n00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.464\nBut that information is there\nin the document for you, so\n\n92\n00:05:13.464 --> 00:05:16.230\nif you are trying to decide\nwhich algorithm to choose,\n\n93\n00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.557\nbecause you do have all that\nflexibility all those options here.\n\n94\n00:05:19.557 --> 00:05:22.565\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nwhat are we gonna end up taking look at,\n\n95\n00:05:22.565 --> 00:05:24.331\nas you show us more about NIC Teaming?\n\n96\n00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.209\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's see here,\nlet we pull up this up.\n\n97\n00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:28.414\nIf we can take a look at my screen here.\n\n98\n00:05:28.414 --> 00:05:32.055\nSo, NIC Teaming is a feature that\nwas introduced with Server 2012,\n\n99\n00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:33.079\nit's really cool.\n\n100\n00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:37.573\nThat doesn't mean that it wasn't\nexisting prior to Server 2012\n\n101\n00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:39.587\noperating system, however,\n\n102\n00:05:39.587 --> 00:05:45.018\nat that point in time it would have been\nprovided by independent hardware vendors.\n\n103\n00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:49.480\nSo it would have been a third party\nsolution, but here Microsoft just said,\n\n104\n00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.380\nhey let's go ahead and\nintegrate this concept right into the OS.\n\n105\n00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.456\nSo everything we'll be looking at here\nis just straight out of the box sort to\n\n106\n00:05:57.456 --> 00:06:00.832\nspeak, we're not adding any\nkind of additional software, so\n\n107\n00:06:00.832 --> 00:06:02.058\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n108\n00:06:02.058 --> 00:06:08.025\nWe're really gonna be taking a look here\nabout the idea of NIC Teaming, however,\n\n109\n00:06:08.025 --> 00:06:14.179\nwe're not focusing so much on the use in\nHyper-V in a virtualization environment.\n\n110\n00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:17.618\nLater on the series, there is a section\nthat really focuses on Hyper-V\n\n111\n00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:21.320\nconfigurations, and so\nwe'll spend a little bit more time there.\n\n112\n00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.940\nSo I just want you to be aware that,\nlike I said,\n\n113\n00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.347\nyou can have up to 32 network interface\ncards on a physical host, two for VMs.\n\n114\n00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:30.724\nThere are some limitations there.\n\n115\n00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:36.018\nMicrosoft does not support utilizing\nany kind of nested teaming structure,\n\n116\n00:06:36.018 --> 00:06:41.320\nnot to say that it can't work, but\nthey definitely do not recommend that.\n\n117\n00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.410\nThey do not recommend having more\nthan one team per server as well.\n\n118\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.996\nThe OS is not just gonna recognize\nthose independent teams and\n\n119\n00:06:48.996 --> 00:06:50.694\nthere could be serious problems there.\n\n120\n00:06:50.694 --> 00:06:52.584\nIt's not recommended, but\n\n121\n00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:57.000\nthere are a couple different ways\nthat we can actually set this up.\n\n122\n00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.262\nIt's really not difficult to set up\nat all and you guys will see that,\n\n123\n00:06:59.262 --> 00:06:59.972\nwe'll run through.\n\n124\n00:06:59.972 --> 00:07:02.024\nWe have a couple options there.\n\n125\n00:07:02.024 --> 00:07:06.722\nJust like everything else you've seen\nwithin this series you have the ability to\n\n126\n00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:11.005\nset it up via the GUI right there within\nserver manager or you can set it up,\n\n127\n00:07:11.005 --> 00:07:15.082\nand manage it, and maintain it as\nwell right through PowerShell, and\n\n128\n00:07:15.082 --> 00:07:16.772\nhere's a command for that.\n\n129\n00:07:16.772 --> 00:07:18.209\nI had to put it in quotations.\n\n130\n00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:20.635\nI can't get the font color to change\nhere without changing everything.\n\n131\n00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:27.250\nSo just so you see that this is gonna be\nthe particular commandlit to go ahead and\n\n132\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:34.283\ncreate a new, and you'll see here it\nsays NETlbfo, so that's another name.\n\n133\n00:07:34.283 --> 00:07:40.268\nThat's gonna be Microsoft's terminology\nhere for load balancing fail over.\n\n134\n00:07:40.268 --> 00:07:43.169\nSo, that's what LBFO stands for.\n\n135\n00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:46.909\nSo, when you see that command and you're\nlike, I told you it has a lot of names and\n\n136\n00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:48.676\nthat's just another example there.\n\n137\n00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:51.319\nSo, it really depends on which\nvendor you're speaking to.\n\n138\n00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.653\nSo, I'll try to incorporate\nthat here as well.\n\n139\n00:07:53.653 --> 00:07:56.559\nSo, okay This is maybe\nan industry standard name and\n\n140\n00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.484\nthis is a Microsoft terminology.\n\n141\n00:07:58.484 --> 00:08:02.232\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee looking at the idea of\nthis command and the idea of PowerShell\n\n142\n00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:06.646\nagain, I know that we've emphasized this,\nand we're probably gonna be emphasizing\n\n143\n00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:10.410\nthe use of PowerShell, why is it so\nimportant that we actually know both?\n\n144\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:16.142\n&gt;&gt; So, just like everything else we've\nmentioned Microsoft's heading that way\n\n145\n00:08:16.142 --> 00:08:20.116\ntowards a more command line interface\ndriven management option and\n\n146\n00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:21.455\nthis is no exception.\n\n147\n00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:25.938\nHere with NIC teaming,\nwe're able to go ahead and manage other,\n\n148\n00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:29.199\nutilising power show and\neven server manager,\n\n149\n00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:33.927\nwe have the ability to remote manage,\nand from an exam perspective,\n\n150\n00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:39.091\nI don't know what else to tell you here\n[LAUGH] without really cluing you in.\n\n151\n00:08:39.091 --> 00:08:43.635\nIt's very important to know these cmdlets\nand not just isolate it here to NIC\n\n152\n00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:48.690\nteaming, but in everything that we've\ncovered so far, and will cover so.\n\n153\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:52.238\n&gt;&gt; So the example that you showed us right\nthere on the screen where it actually\n\n154\n00:08:52.238 --> 00:08:55.728\ndoes have that, what you have right\nthere right is the cmdlet itself, and\n\n155\n00:08:55.728 --> 00:08:59.479\nthen that first one in team one, that's\njust an example of a name you can make.\n\n156\n00:08:59.479 --> 00:09:02.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I just have some generic names\nhere, not anything too creative.\n\n157\n00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.770\nSo if I had had a team created,\nthis would be the name.\n\n158\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.450\nI just put team one, and then for your\ndifferent adapters that you have in your\n\n159\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.670\nsystem, and I just had two here,\nEthernet and Ethernet 2, but\n\n160\n00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.700\nif you wanted to be a little more\ncreative you could even specify by that\n\n161\n00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.800\nparticular manufacturer or something,\nor the speed even if you wanted to.\n\n162\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.850\nWe do have two different modes\nthat I'd like to explain here.\n\n163\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.090\nWe have one called active active and\nactive passive.\n\n164\n00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.750\nIf we could go fullscreen for one moment,\nit's kind of right there behind my head.\n\n165\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.290\nBecause this is the Microsoft's\nterminology that you'll see\n\n166\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.040\neven in the GUI, it's called standby mode.\n\n167\n00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.171\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at active active first and\n\n168\n00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:44.520\nthen we'll get to standby there.\n\n169\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.186\nSo in this particular\nexample I have a switch here,\n\n170\n00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:51.779\nand I have two physical\nnetwork interface cards.\n\n171\n00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:55.517\nSo let's say these were inside\nof a server right here, and\n\n172\n00:09:55.517 --> 00:09:59.486\neach one of those network\ninterface cards had a 1Gbps speed,\n\n173\n00:09:59.486 --> 00:10:02.384\nif I were to go ahead and\naggregate those two or\n\n174\n00:10:02.384 --> 00:10:07.600\nbond them together theoretically I'm\njust increasing that throughput there.\n\n175\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.450\nI'm bonding them together so\nthey can work as a unit, work together,\n\n176\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.161\nso I would get an increased\nbandwidth here of 2Gbps.\n\n177\n00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:18.497\nSo that's what would\nhappen with active active.\n\n178\n00:10:18.497 --> 00:10:21.529\nNow, if one of these links were to fail or\n\n179\n00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:26.886\none of network interface cards will\nhave a physical hardware failure,\n\n180\n00:10:26.886 --> 00:10:30.366\nthen I would still be able to communicate,\nbut\n\n181\n00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:35.480\nI would be dropped down to that\n1Gbps bandwidth connection there.\n\n182\n00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.720\nSo both of these options that we'll\nsee here provide fault tolerance,\n\n183\n00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.970\nits just a matter of how you want them\nconfigured if you want a more stable,\n\n184\n00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.300\nmore predictable environment or\n\n185\n00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.290\nyou want to have that increased bandwidth,\nand you're not really too concerned if\n\n186\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.320\nperhaps you drop down a little bit until\nyou can get that hardware replaced.\n\n187\n00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.050\nLike I said, these configurations,\nwhat we'll look at here just guidelines,\n\n188\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.790\nand I'll explain which each one does, but\nit's gonna be completely dependent and\n\n189\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.930\nyou'll have to logically walk through\nthat process to determine what's best for\n\n190\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.896\nyour organization for\nthat configuration there.\n\n191\n00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:14.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee what about that\nactive passive that you're talking about?\n\n192\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.986\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so active passive, if I had,\nif we look at my screen again yes,\n\n193\n00:11:19.986 --> 00:11:25.029\nso let's say this network interface\ncard one is up and running and\n\n194\n00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:31.197\nI have my ingress and egress traffic\nstrictly running on NIC1 at a 1Gbps link.\n\n195\n00:11:31.197 --> 00:11:36.279\nSo the operating system does\nnot utilized NIC2 or recognized\n\n196\n00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:43.470\nit as a communication option until NIC1\nwere to fail, that link or the card there.\n\n197\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:48.450\nSo that's when NIC2 would kick into gear,\nand compensate,\n\n198\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.120\nand take over for NIC1 that had failed.\n\n199\n00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.150\nSo ultimately you're gonna see that\nstability there and you're gonna be\n\n200\n00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.610\nable to have that predictability,\nbecause you're gonna maintain that 1Gbps\n\n201\n00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:04.710\nconnection, but your other NIC is\njust sitting there essentially\n\n202\n00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:10.800\nstanding by in standby mode until\nthat hardware failure occurs.\n\n203\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.280\nSo a couple different ways just to\ngo ahead and configure it there.\n\n204\n00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.210\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee let's make sure\nthat we understand what can\n\n205\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.500\nhappen here right in the active active.\n\n206\n00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.234\nSo, for the active active I get better\nbandwidth for my machine, which is great,\n\n207\n00:12:24.234 --> 00:12:26.851\ncuz it means I can do\na lot more things faster.\n\n208\n00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:30.261\nBut if one of those links fails it\nkind of fails back down to one, so\n\n209\n00:12:30.261 --> 00:12:33.114\nI'll probably experience\na slow down there, right?\n\n210\n00:12:33.114 --> 00:12:37.479\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you were really pushing\nyour system, and relying on that high\n\n211\n00:12:37.479 --> 00:12:42.429\nconnection then that may pose an issue for\nyou, so that's definitely something\n\n212\n00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:47.040\nto consider, but most of the time it's\nnot going to be that big of an issue.\n\n213\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.527\nSo you would just notice that performance\ndowngrade until you could get it fixed.\n\n214\n00:12:52.527 --> 00:12:54.750\nIt's gonna be your prerogative there.\n\n215\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n216\n00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.958\nBut then with the active passive,\nwe shouldn't notice, right?\n\n217\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.850\nWhat should end up happening is if one\nfails the other one takes over and we-\n\n218\n00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.593\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it should be fully seamless and\n\n219\n00:13:02.593 --> 00:13:04.515\nautomated happening in the back.\n\n220\n00:13:04.515 --> 00:13:07.860\nThat's what's really cool here and\neven when we take a look at these and\n\n221\n00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.759\nwe create these teams,\nwe're managing that team as a unit and\n\n222\n00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:13.586\nwe're not having to worry\nabout each individual adapter.\n\n223\n00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:15.705\nThat's all happening within\nthe software behind the scenes.\n\n224\n00:13:15.705 --> 00:13:18.960\nSo that's kind of a neat feature as well.\n\n225\n00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.911\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\nNow, there was another phrase you had\n\n226\n00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:24.568\nright there on your particular diagram\nthat said that it was only available\n\n227\n00:13:24.568 --> 00:13:25.861\nthough in, what is that?\n\n228\n00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Switch Independent mode.\n\n229\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So we have different modes, and\n\n230\n00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.590\nthey're going to be options.\n\n231\n00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.470\nWhen we go through the Wizard,\nor we're using PowerShell,\n\n232\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.257\nthese are gonna be parameters that we\nneed to specify to really configure this.\n\n233\n00:13:39.257 --> 00:13:40.970\nSo, we have three different options.\n\n234\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.591\nI'll cover each one of them for you.\n\n235\n00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:45.139\nSwitch Independent mode,\nlet's take a look at that.\n\n236\n00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:51.247\nYes, this is the only mode that\ndoes support the active passive or\n\n237\n00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.700\nstandby mode.\n\n238\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.360\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at that here.\n\n239\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.297\nWith Switch-Independent Teaming, this\nis actually gonna be your default mode,\n\n240\n00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:02.630\nthis is the easiest mode to configure.\n\n241\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.516\nThe other two that we'll talk\nabout are really reserved for\n\n242\n00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:11.269\nhigh end or I should say high\navailability enterprise instances there.\n\n243\n00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:13.784\nThis is gonna be the most common and\n\n244\n00:14:13.784 --> 00:14:17.270\nthat's probably a really\ngood place to start.\n\n245\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.590\nSo, that's what we'll take a look at here.\n\n246\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.720\nThis is the default mode it's,\n\n247\n00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.020\nlike I said,\nthe only mode to support standby adapters.\n\n248\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.340\nIt can support different\nspeeds in standbys.\n\n249\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.728\nSo let's think about the logic of that for\na second,\n\n250\n00:14:29.728 --> 00:14:34.733\nactually let me hop back to this last\nslide, and if we look at active active and\n\n251\n00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:39.977\nI showed this example of 1Gbps and\n1Gbps aggregated or bonded, we get 2Gbps.\n\n252\n00:14:39.977 --> 00:14:44.098\nNow, what if I had a 10 gig card and\na 1 gig card?\n\n253\n00:14:44.098 --> 00:14:48.490\nWell, essentially, I'd be wasting\nnine gigs of potential bandwidth\n\n254\n00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:53.200\nbecause that ten gig card is not can be\nable to be running at its full potential.\n\n255\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.040\nIt'll be dropped down to 1 GB and\nwe'll see a little bit of a loss,\n\n256\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.100\nI mean, waste I guess would\nbe the proper word there.\n\n257\n00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.940\nHowever, in an active standby mode,\nI could have NIC1 be 10 Gbps\n\n258\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.170\nand have a really good connection there,\nand if this card were to fail,\n\n259\n00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:18.060\nthe back up, the standby adaptor\ncould kick in at 1 Gbps there.\n\n260\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.765\nSo you're able to go ahead and mix speeds\nwith the standby mode, but not in any\n\n261\n00:15:21.765 --> 00:15:25.869\nother types of modes there, or it's not\nthat you're not allowed to, it's just that\n\n262\n00:15:25.869 --> 00:15:29.879\nyou're not getting the best benefit out\nof that hardware and that configuration.\n\n263\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.130\nAll right,\nhandles teaming at the server level.\n\n264\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.357\nSo what does that mean?\n\n265\n00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:40.107\nHere I see two different switches, but\n\n266\n00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:44.867\nmy switches are not going to be\ncontrolling any of my settings here.\n\n267\n00:15:44.867 --> 00:15:49.018\nSo the operating system,\nthe server's controlling that ingress and\n\n268\n00:15:49.018 --> 00:15:53.109\negress traffic, and how it's handled and\nmanaged in load balance.\n\n269\n00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:57.120\nSo when we talk about the other modes,\nlike I said, they're not as popular.\n\n270\n00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.933\nBecause you also have to make sure that\nyour switches can support them and\n\n271\n00:16:00.933 --> 00:16:04.320\nhave additional features which\nmay equate to more money.\n\n272\n00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.700\nSo that's another reason there.\n\n273\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.680\nLet's see, can use one or\nmore multiple switches.\n\n274\n00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.750\nOkay, let's take a look at this diagram.\n\n275\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:17.140\nSo here, I do say that,\nI have two separate switches.\n\n276\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.670\nThey're completely independent,\nthat's fine.\n\n277\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.030\nEach network interface card, so\n\n278\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.600\nboth of these network interface\ncard are in the same computer.\n\n279\n00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.850\nBut, if we think about, if both of these\ncards were plugged in to the same switch,\n\n280\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.290\nmy single point of failure,\nwould be that switch, that hardware there.\n\n281\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.760\nIf that switch went down, then that\nserver would still lose connectivity.\n\n282\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.793\nSo, if I can spread that out a little bit,\nand have two separate switches,\n\n283\n00:16:40.793 --> 00:16:44.340\ntwo network interfaces card, and\ntwo network interface cards, that\n\n284\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.550\nstatistically is gonna reduce my chances\nof both of those pieces of hardware or\n\n285\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.450\nlinks, even the cable having\nan issue at the same time.\n\n286\n00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.810\nSo, I'm just kind of looking and\nplaying my odds here.\n\n287\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.860\nAnd another thing you might wanna\nconsider maybe my standby switch.\n\n288\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.340\nWe talked about having the better card\nbeing run in production and having your\n\n289\n00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:11.140\nstandby be, maybe older equipment are not\nas fast to help with budgeting purposes.\n\n290\n00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.776\nSo if we take that concept and carry\nit over to your switch that particular\n\n291\n00:17:15.776 --> 00:17:18.973\npiece of hardware you could\nhave a faster switch.\n\n292\n00:17:18.973 --> 00:17:21.726\nBut maybe that particular\nswitch has less ports and\n\n293\n00:17:21.726 --> 00:17:24.670\nyou don't wanna utilize\nboth of those ports.\n\n294\n00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:29.040\nSo you could use a slower switch\nconnected to your standby adapter for\n\n295\n00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.310\nthat failover there as well.\n\n296\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.850\nSo that's just something else.\n\n297\n00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.640\nLike I said, a lot of the different\nthings that configure but\n\n298\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.030\nyou just to try to make the best use of\nhow you want your systems to react, and\n\n299\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.720\nwhat hardware you can afford.\n\n300\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.180\nReally that's what it boils down to here.\n\n301\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.960\nAll right, so\nincoming traffic comes through one card,\n\n302\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.760\nunless the virtual machines\nare in use with teaming mode.\n\n303\n00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.164\nThere are two different modes that\nare specific to virtualization,\n\n304\n00:17:55.164 --> 00:17:59.610\nthat's going to be Hyper-V Port or\nDynamic configurations.\n\n305\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.970\nAnd like I said we'll look at that\na little bit more when we talk about\n\n306\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.420\nvirtualizations, just to\nknow that that does exist.\n\n307\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.390\nSo when we're really are talking about\nswitch independent mode, that one card\n\n308\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:15.370\nhandles the ingress and egress traffic\nunless there's a hardware failure there.\n\n309\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:21.270\nAnd you can also add additional cards\nhere to increase the bandwidth,\n\n310\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.940\nlike I said it's not set in stone, it's\nnot black and white, you do have options.\n\n311\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.795\nBut switch independent is the only option\nthat will allow you to have a back over,\n\n312\n00:18:29.795 --> 00:18:32.910\nor excuse me a failover backup\n\n313\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.570\nadapter that's just kind of sitting\nthere waiting to come into action.\n\n314\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.130\nSo that's switch independent mode.\n\n315\n00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.870\nSwitch independent teaming, so\nthis is a setting that we have.\n\n316\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:49.750\nNow there are two switch dependent\noptions, so let's take a look at those.\n\n317\n00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.690\nThe first one I wanna show you here\nis going to be something called\n\n318\n00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.360\nstatic teaming.\n\n319\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:00.230\nSo static teaming, and\nthis is something that people kind of,\n\n320\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.130\nin the industry sometimes\npeople will use terms loosely.\n\n321\n00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.840\nBut if we look at the under pending\ntechnology here, the actual protocol that\n\n322\n00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:15.130\nstatic teaming utilizes it\nis going to be IEEE 802.3ad.\n\n323\n00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.090\nSo that's important there, because\na lot of people get that confused with,\n\n324\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.870\nwhen we look at LACP\nthe particular protocol\n\n325\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.410\nthat that option uses is\ngoing to be different, newer.\n\n326\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:31.140\nSo this static teaming is\nswitch dependent okay?\n\n327\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.410\nSo what does that mean?\n\n328\n00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.760\nThat means that my switch is handling\nhow that traffic should behave.\n\n329\n00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.960\nAnd I have both of these cards\nplugged into one switch.\n\n330\n00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.580\nDoes that mean you can\nonly use one switch?\n\n331\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:50.190\nWell, that's kind of a strange question\nbecause the real answer is no.\n\n332\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.682\nYou can have more than one\nswitch with this configuration.\n\n333\n00:19:53.682 --> 00:19:58.307\nHowever, the switch must present, the\nswitches, if you're using more than one,\n\n334\n00:19:58.307 --> 00:20:02.130\nmust present themselves as one\nswitch to the operating system.\n\n335\n00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.040\nSo that's gonna be an additional layer of\ncomplexity that you'll need to research if\n\n336\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:11.220\nyou plan on utilizing multiple switches in\na static teaming environment, just FYI.\n\n337\n00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:17.730\nSo definitely your switch is going to\nneed to support static teaming and\n\n338\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.495\nsupport 802.3ad.\n\n339\n00:20:19.495 --> 00:20:22.501\nSo that's something you'll\nwanna check out here, so\n\n340\n00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:24.600\nthe ports also need to be configured.\n\n341\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.780\nSo most of the interfaces for\n\n342\n00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.600\nthose switches will have you\nconfigure each individual port.\n\n343\n00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.220\nWell Cherokee why do I care,\nwhy is that important to me?\n\n344\n00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.760\nWell these switches are not forgiving.\n\n345\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:42.020\nIf you plug these cables into the wrong\nports then teaming doesn't exist here.\n\n346\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.675\nSo that's why it's really important\nto understand that most of them\n\n347\n00:20:46.675 --> 00:20:51.650\nare configured at a port based level\nhere with static teaming as well as our\n\n348\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.071\nother LACP that we'll look at too.\n\n349\n00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:58.610\nAnd like I said, the operating\nsystem must only see one switch.\n\n350\n00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.230\nSo it can't see two\nphysical separate switches.\n\n351\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.600\nThey have to be configured\nto appear as one there.\n\n352\n00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.400\nAnd the incoming traffic is\ncontrolled by the switch.\n\n353\n00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.570\nAnd it provides packet-based\nload balancing.\n\n354\n00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.380\nBecause when we look at\nsome of the others here and\n\n355\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.130\nthey're really talking about steam based\nload balancing, not at that packet level.\n\n356\n00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.150\nBut you could also utilize this.\n\n357\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:25.050\nSo these two switch dependent modes\nare used for aggregation or bonding.\n\n358\n00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.320\nSo you do have that redundancy.\n\n359\n00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.080\nThe redundancy still exists,\nbut you always have that\n\n360\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.600\ndrop down if one of those cards physically\nwere to fail or the link there.\n\n361\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.899\nSo that's just something\nto keep in mind as well.\n\n362\n00:21:39.582 --> 00:21:44.699\nThe second switch dependent\noption is called LACP so\n\n363\n00:21:44.699 --> 00:21:47.954\nLACP, however you wanna say it,\n\n364\n00:21:47.954 --> 00:21:52.504\nI call it\nLink Aggregation Control Protocol.\n\n365\n00:21:52.504 --> 00:21:58.085\nAll right, that's the actual underlying\nprotocol here which is IEEE 802.1X.\n\n366\n00:21:58.085 --> 00:22:02.616\nIt's kind of interesting,\nthis protocol was\n\n367\n00:22:02.616 --> 00:22:07.845\ndesigned under the Under\nthe committee that designed\n\n368\n00:22:07.845 --> 00:22:12.410\nthe previous protocol here of 802.3ad.\n\n369\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.180\nSo as everyone was\nworking on this project,\n\n370\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.960\nthey kind of enhanced and\ndeveloped 802.1AX.\n\n371\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.030\nSo it is different,\nthe actual protocol that's being utilized.\n\n372\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:27.940\nThis is newer, but it still has a lot\nof the same qualities that we saw\n\n373\n00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.400\nwith the other switch dependent\nmode were talking about static, but\n\n374\n00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.692\nhere it's not so static.\n\n375\n00:22:33.692 --> 00:22:38.390\nThis protocol's a little more intuitive,\nyou can utilize dynamic links,\n\n376\n00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.430\nyou can dynamically add\nnetwork interface cards.\n\n377\n00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:46.240\nIt does require that hardware support just\nlike we saw for those switches previously.\n\n378\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.650\nThe incoming traffic again,\n\n379\n00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.930\nis controlled by the switch not\nthe operating system there.\n\n380\n00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.980\nAnd it creates a single pipe for\nmultiple network adapters, so\n\n381\n00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.920\nagain we're utilizing this for\naggregation and bonding purposes.\n\n382\n00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.900\nThe switches do need to be configured\nagain and like I said previously,\n\n383\n00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.390\nalso check to make sure that\nyou're paying attention\n\n384\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.909\nto those port numbers if it is\nconfigured on a port level basis there.\n\n385\n00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.275\nSo you can dynamically add network\nadapters to a NIC team and\n\n386\n00:23:14.275 --> 00:23:18.878\nthis setup is a little more involved that\neverything else that we've spoke about,\n\n387\n00:23:18.878 --> 00:23:23.170\nso it's usually reserved for\nhigh availability enterprise environments.\n\n388\n00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.371\nI'm not saying you won't\nhave to come across it, but\n\n389\n00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:28.362\nat least now you have the tools and\n\n390\n00:23:28.362 --> 00:23:33.210\nyou can reference back to that Word\ndocument that I shared with you as well.\n\n391\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:37.550\nSo let me just really clarify here.\n\n392\n00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:41.810\nWhen we're talking about load balancing\nand the flow of traffic here.\n\n393\n00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.273\nSo for our switch dependent modes,\n\n394\n00:23:44.273 --> 00:23:47.811\nthe incoming traffic is\ncontrolled by the switch.\n\n395\n00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:51.521\nAnd when we look at static or L-A-C-P,\n\n396\n00:23:51.521 --> 00:23:56.927\nLACP there The outgoing traffic\nis still going to outbound,\n\n397\n00:23:56.927 --> 00:24:03.181\negress traffic is still going to be\nmanaged by that operating system.\n\n398\n00:24:03.181 --> 00:24:07.355\nSo you're gonna be presented with the\noption to choose, well, how do you want\n\n399\n00:24:07.355 --> 00:24:11.640\nthe operating system to handle load\nbalancing for that egress traffic?\n\n400\n00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.750\nSo let's take a look here\non my screen again, and\n\n401\n00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:17.620\nl wanna show you some of the balancing\nmodes that you would be presented with.\n\n402\n00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.200\nSo this is going to provide you balancing\nmodes to provide the operating system\n\n403\n00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.040\ncontrol of outgoing traffic\nregardless of using a software or\n\n404\n00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.870\nhard based solution, and they're just\ntalking about a virtual NIC versus\n\n405\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.370\nan actual physical network\ninterface card here.\n\n406\n00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:37.601\nSo you have a couple different options,\nand this is like what Ronnie had mentioned\n\n407\n00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:40.257\nand pointed out in the very\nbeginning of this show.\n\n408\n00:24:40.257 --> 00:24:43.839\nThose different load\nbalancing algorithm options.\n\n409\n00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:47.753\nSo address hashing, so this can be\ndone a couple of different ways.\n\n410\n00:24:47.753 --> 00:24:50.854\nWhich you really don't need\nto go this far into it and\n\n411\n00:24:50.854 --> 00:24:54.180\nknow the different hash\nalgorithms that are utilized.\n\n412\n00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:58.285\nBut it divides traffic based by\nthe IP address port and more.\n\n413\n00:24:58.285 --> 00:25:01.164\nAnd what that means is, so for instance,\n\n414\n00:25:01.164 --> 00:25:05.540\nthere are three different\ntypes here that we can use.\n\n415\n00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:10.740\nThere's a transport ports option that\nutilizes the TCP port and the UDP port,\n\n416\n00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.240\nplus the destination IP address\nto go ahead and create that hash.\n\n417\n00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.779\nAnd that hash is used to separate the load\nbalancing there, there's a couple others,\n\n418\n00:25:18.779 --> 00:25:20.147\nlet me just look at my notes here.\n\n419\n00:25:20.147 --> 00:25:23.335\nIP address.\n\n420\n00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:28.053\nIt creates less streams, but\nit's less balanced because the way\n\n421\n00:25:28.053 --> 00:25:33.290\nthat it's configured there,\nit just utilizes the IP addresses.\n\n422\n00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.600\nAnd then there's also one for\n\n423\n00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.670\nMAC addressing that uses MAC\naddresses to create those hashes.\n\n424\n00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.950\nBut it's really not recommended for\nIP traffic.\n\n425\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.696\nYou would use that for\nLayer 2 transmissions as well.\n\n426\n00:25:44.696 --> 00:25:48.083\nSo, like I said, you don't really need\nto know those, but just know that there\n\n427\n00:25:48.083 --> 00:25:51.570\nare different options here for\nyour address hashes for that algorithm.\n\n428\n00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:56.380\nNow the last two are going to be, I\nmentioned them on another previous slide,\n\n429\n00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:01.190\nthese two options for load balancing\nare only going to be available if you're\n\n430\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:06.751\nutilizing virtual network interface cards,\nso if you're using a virtual option here.\n\n431\n00:26:06.751 --> 00:26:10.906\nSo you have Hyper-V Port, which divides\ntraffic based on that virtual machine.\n\n432\n00:26:10.906 --> 00:26:13.362\nAnd this last option here, Dynamic,\n\n433\n00:26:13.362 --> 00:26:18.440\nyou're only gonna see this if you're\nrunning server 2012 R2 or higher.\n\n434\n00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.360\nIt's not available on just regular 2012,\nso\n\n435\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.200\nyou won't even see that option available.\n\n436\n00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.261\nWhich is nice if you're running\nthrough the wizard, and you'll see\n\n437\n00:26:28.261 --> 00:26:31.864\nin a few moments when we get into that\noption, it's not even gonna be available.\n\n438\n00:26:31.864 --> 00:26:34.606\nIt's not gonna allow you to select\nit because it just says hey,\n\n439\n00:26:34.606 --> 00:26:38.930\nyou don't have a system or an environment\nand configuration that will support this.\n\n440\n00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:44.083\nNow, when you look at Dynamic here,\nload balancing, it takes\n\n441\n00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:50.319\nthe best of both worlds, these two\nprior modes and combines them together.\n\n442\n00:26:50.319 --> 00:26:54.685\nSo it's recommended that if you\nare running 2012 R2 or later,\n\n443\n00:26:54.685 --> 00:26:59.980\nthat you go ahead and use dynamic load\nbalancing for your virtual machines there.\n\n444\n00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.650\nSo it can move the actual network\nstreams between network cards and\n\n445\n00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:08.050\nchoose which path is gonna\nbe the fastest for you and\n\n446\n00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.490\nthe best path, so it provides\nthat extra load balancing there.\n\n447\n00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:16.270\nSo those are gonna be your main\noptions when it comes to configuring.\n\n448\n00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.535\nAnd I think that's what we should do next,\n\n449\n00:27:18.535 --> 00:27:21.540\nis actually get in there,\nshow you how it's done.\n\n450\n00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, we definitely want\nto make sure that we understand as well as\n\n451\n00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:30.340\nconfigure the idea of NIC teaming, but\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n452\n00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.494\nSo we'll actually make that up\nin another episode as well.\n\n453\n00:27:33.494 --> 00:27:36.504\nAnd that way we can show you all the stuff\nthat we've been talking about here.\n\n454\n00:27:36.504 --> 00:27:40.597\nRemember that what we took a look at here,\nright, is understanding the idea behind\n\n455\n00:27:40.597 --> 00:27:44.581\nNIC teaming and why we would choose to do\nit, as well as the options that you have.\n\n456\n00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:46.995\nWhether it's active-active or\nactive-passive and\n\n457\n00:27:46.995 --> 00:27:50.404\ndepending on whether you're actually\nneeding to do load balancing one way or\n\n458\n00:27:50.404 --> 00:27:53.580\nanother way or link aggregation one way or\nanother way as well.\n\n459\n00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.931\nThose are some of the options that\nyou have to consider when you\n\n460\n00:27:56.931 --> 00:27:58.547\nare getting ready to do this.\n\n461\n00:27:58.547 --> 00:28:01.376\nSome of those options include whether you\nwant the operating system to handle it or\n\n462\n00:28:01.376 --> 00:28:03.280\nwhether you want\nthe switches to handle it.\n\n463\n00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.150\nAll of these are actually things that\nyou just, at least in getting ready for\n\n464\n00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:08.660\nthe exam,\n\n465\n00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.640\nmake sure you have a solid understanding\nof the options that are available to you.\n\n466\n00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.290\nBut we do have the configuration to go and\nthat means we are actually going to end\n\n467\n00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.740\nthis episode and\nstart on another one very soon.\n\n468\n00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.190\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n469\n00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

00:00:08.318\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:12.276\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:14.950\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.716\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012,\n\n7\n00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:22.492\nor specifically taking\na look at the exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:27.104\nAnd I'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're actually continuing on with a kind\n\n9\n00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:31.605\nof a little miniseries here, talking about\nNIC teaming, and we're in a part two.\n\n10\n00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:35.677\nIn the first part we already discussed\na little bit about why we actually choose\n\n11\n00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:39.378\nto do so, and some of the options we\nneed to consider when going ahead and\n\n12\n00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:41.929\ndoing NIC teaming for Windows Server 2012.\n\n13\n00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.237\nAnd here to actually guide us through and\nshow us how to configure it, and\n\n14\n00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:48.760\ntalk about some of the other issues as\nwell, is gonna be Miss Cherokee Boose,\n\n15\n00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.683\nCherokee, welcome back to the studios.\n\n16\n00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:51.792\n&gt;&gt; Hi, how's it going Ronnie?\n\n17\n00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:56.552\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, now, Cherokee,\nwe did, we talked a lot, actually, not me,\n\n18\n00:00:56.552 --> 00:00:59.355\nyou talked a lot,\nI asked a few questions here.\n\n19\n00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:02.700\nAnd we really now have a sense of why\nwe wanna do it, and now Cherokee,\n\n20\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.080\nyou're gonna teach us how to do it, right?\n\n21\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm hoping that everything\nthat we saw on the previous episode will\n\n22\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.180\nactually make sense, and we can apply\nit in an actual logical way here.\n\n23\n00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.230\nYou'll see where that knowledge\napplies in the operating system.\n\n24\n00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.670\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen, and\n\n25\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.270\nI wanna introduce you to, first of all,\nwhere you would go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.300\naccess that management capabilities,\nhere within the graphical user interface.\n\n27\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.635\nSo if I'm at my server manager dashboard,\n\n28\n00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:37.535\nclick on the left hand side,\nunder local server.\n\n29\n00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:42.484\nNow, if you can see,\nmaybe let me zoom in a little bit here.\n\n30\n00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:49.033\nCurrently, my individual adapters are\nlisted here on my local machine display.\n\n31\n00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:53.396\nThere is an option that says NIC Teaming,\nwith a link that says Disabled.\n\n32\n00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:57.794\nYou can actually just double click\non this link, and it will bring up\n\n33\n00:01:57.794 --> 00:02:02.600\nthe interface fo you to go ahead,\nthe NIC teaming management interface.\n\n34\n00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.680\nThere's another way that you can\nlaunch this interface via PowerShell,\n\n35\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.850\nso let's go ahead and\ntake a look at how we would do that.\n\n36\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.870\nSo it's actually an executable\nthat you're invoking, and\n\n37\n00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.451\nthe executable is lbfoadmin.exe.\n\n38\n00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:27.540\nAnd if you recall, that is going to be for\nour load balancing failover\n\n39\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.830\nacronym there, is what, okay,\nlet me go ahead and retype that.\n\n40\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.154\nThat is going to be LBF load balancing,\n\n41\n00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:40.970\nand then admin, I had a typo there, sorry.\n\n42\n00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.195\n&gt;&gt; That's yeah, I just saw it.\n\n43\n00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:46.278\n&gt;&gt; This is gonna be fun, I'm already\nmaking mistakes here, but there you go.\n\n44\n00:02:46.278 --> 00:02:50.054\nThat's going to be your management console\nto pull up that graphical user interface.\n\n45\n00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:53.427\nBut you can strictly be using\nPowerShell cmdlets to go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:53.427 --> 00:02:57.700\nmanage these teams, and we'll take a look\nat it from that perspective as well.\n\n47\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.750\nSo let's just close out of here and\nminimize PowerShell for a second.\n\n48\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.930\nSo if I double click on this and\n\n49\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.780\nessentially bring up what we\njust had up there, I can see\n\n50\n00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.580\na couple different things from this view,\nso what are we looking at here, first?\n\n51\n00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.760\nIn this top pane, any servers that\nwere added to this particular,\n\n52\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.360\nunder server management, my server pools.\n\n53\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.320\nAnd I could go ahead and\nmanage multiple servers here remotely.\n\n54\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.080\nNow, these two windows right here on\nthe left hand side, I have my teams.\n\n55\n00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.000\nSo if I had multiple teams,\nthey would display in this window.\n\n56\n00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.020\nAnd underneath these two windows\nwould also be, if I had them.\n\n57\n00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.510\nThere would be, statistical information\nunderneath, on the left hand side.\n\n58\n00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.140\nAnd on the right, hand side, over here,\nI have adapters and interfaces.\n\n59\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.370\nAnd the statistical information\nwould be underneath, as well.\n\n60\n00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:05.079\nI can see the different network interface\ncards here on the right hand side,\n\n61\n00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.825\nmy adapters,\nthat are available to be added to pools.\n\n62\n00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:12.257\nSo, if I wanted to go ahead and\ncreate a pool,\n\n63\n00:04:12.257 --> 00:04:16.512\nexcuse me, the NIC team,\nI'm using improper terminology here.\n\n64\n00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:19.152\nWe're not disks, we're dealing\nwith network interface cards.\n\n65\n00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:20.932\nBut if I wanted to create a team,\n\n66\n00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:24.602\nI have two options in\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n67\n00:04:24.602 --> 00:04:29.542\nSo I could select by just\nholding down my Shift key, and\n\n68\n00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:32.930\nthen right clicking and\nselect Add New Team.\n\n69\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.450\nAlternatively, under My Tasks option\nup here, I could select New Team.\n\n70\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.020\nAnd also on the right hand side here,\nyou could say, add to a new team,\n\n71\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.290\nas long as those adapters were\nhighlighted here in that right hand pane.\n\n72\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.310\nSo you have a couple different options,\nand again, we'll look at PowerShell,\n\n73\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.030\nhow we have that other option as well.\n\n74\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.810\nWhat I wanted to show you here real quick,\nlet me just minimize this.\n\n75\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.030\nI wanna show you how the operating\nsystem actually recognizes the adapters.\n\n76\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.020\nSo if I double click on one of\nthe adapters here, what it does is,\n\n77\n00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.310\nit pulls up our Network and Sharing\nCenter, just like a shortcut to that, so\n\n78\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.330\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n79\n00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.693\nIf you look here, I have, because I'm\nusing a virtualized environment here.\n\n80\n00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:22.421\nI really am just gonna be focusing on\ncreating teams here for Ethernet 1 and\n\n81\n00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.140\nEthernet 2.\n\n82\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.090\nAnd if you just look at the properties\nof these individual adapters,\n\n83\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.090\nI can see everything appears to be normal.\n\n84\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.750\nIf I select here for my IPv4 settings,\n\n85\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.730\ncurrently I'm just obtaining an IP\naddress automatically from DHCP,\n\n86\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.450\nnothing fancy or unusual here.\n\n87\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.780\nBut I just wanna show you that, because\nonce we create that team, that team will\n\n88\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.780\nsee how the operating system handles and\nidentifies that individual team there.\n\n89\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.995\nSo let me just go ahead and\nminimize that for a second.\n\n90\n00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:02.288\nOne other thing that I\nwould like to do here,\n\n91\n00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:05.939\nlet me pull up a command prompt,\nthat will work.\n\n92\n00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:13.058\nI wanna go ahead and\nrun a continuous ping, because sometimes,\n\n93\n00:06:13.058 --> 00:06:19.325\nsome of the configuration functions\nthat we're gonna be looking at here.\n\n94\n00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:25.100\nThey may cause any kind of\ninconsistencies with communication.\n\n95\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.540\nSo it might give a little bit\nof a drop of communication,\n\n96\n00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.420\nso that's what I wanna\nmonitor during the show.\n\n97\n00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.625\nBecause you don't want to have these\ninconsistencies or lack of communication.\n\n98\n00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:40.335\nIn a production environment, just be aware\nthat it may cause some issues there.\n\n99\n00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:43.425\nSo let's see here, so\nmy font, let's go ahead and\n\n100\n00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:48.215\nbump that up, and the color for\nthe screen text as well.\n\n101\n00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:54.774\nWhat I'm gonna do is just ping\nthe domain controller here,\n\n102\n00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:57.896\nand we'll do a continuous ping.\n\n103\n00:06:57.896 --> 00:07:02.775\nSorry, guys, give me one second, I'm just\ntrying to put this over on the side, so\n\n104\n00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:06.775\nwe can have it not taking up\nthe entire real estate here, all right.\n\n105\n00:07:08.023 --> 00:07:13.057\nOkay, so, this is gonna be,\nit's 192.168.0.1,\n\n106\n00:07:13.057 --> 00:07:17.462\nI believe, is the IP address,\nand I forgot my -t.\n\n107\n00:07:17.462 --> 00:07:21.560\nLet me end that, then do a -t for\n\n108\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.180\nmy continuous ping, so we'll just\nkeep that up and over to the side.\n\n109\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.740\nI'll just minimize that, but\nas we're playing around in here,\n\n110\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.118\nthat may be something you wanna\ndo while you're practicing.\n\n111\n00:07:34.118 --> 00:07:39.482\nSo that you can see if any of these\nconfigurations make cause some latency or\n\n112\n00:07:39.482 --> 00:07:41.452\nunwanted problems there.\n\n113\n00:07:41.452 --> 00:07:45.933\nSo, what are we gonna do now,\nI'm gonna go ahead and Create NIC Team.\n\n114\n00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:51.002\nSo if I go back to my NIC Teaming\nmanagement face here,\n\n115\n00:07:51.002 --> 00:07:56.870\nI'm gonna show you just my basic\ntwo Ethernet adapters here.\n\n116\n00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.188\nWe can see they're running at 1 GB\nper second, and we'll go ahead and\n\n117\n00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:00.870\nright click.\n\n118\n00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.347\nClick and select add to a new team.\n\n119\n00:08:04.347 --> 00:08:06.010\nSo a couple of things.\n\n120\n00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.550\nYou must create a name for your teams,\nso I'm gonna get super creative here and\n\n121\n00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:16.410\ncall this Team1 and\nreally that's about it.\n\n122\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.130\nYou have to have more than one\nadapter selected, and here I have two\n\n123\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.670\nselected because I'd already\nselected them in a previous screen.\n\n124\n00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.010\nHowever, I do have\nadditional properties here,\n\n125\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.250\nif you click this little button\nyou will see more options.\n\n126\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.640\nNow, everything that we talked\nabout in the last show, this is\n\n127\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.830\nwhere you would go ahead and configure\nthat within the graphical user interface.\n\n128\n00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:45.690\nSo, because of the way that my\nparticular environment is set up.\n\n129\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.330\nI only have the option to\nuse switch independent.\n\n130\n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:53.050\nI'm not running on a switch that\nsupports my switch dependent modes.\n\n131\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:59.282\nRemember that was going to be static and\nthe LACP for\n\n132\n00:08:59.282 --> 00:09:04.280\nour aggregation there but here,\nlike I said, the switch independent\n\n133\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.200\nis gonna be the most common so\nthat's what we'll stick with now.\n\n134\n00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.400\nAnd also, I am not utilizing any\nkind of virtual machines here for\n\n135\n00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.210\nthis particular team so,\n\n136\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.270\nthe address hash is the only\noption that I have, I'm not able\n\n137\n00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:25.220\nto use the other two that we had looked\nat for those virtualization options.\n\n138\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:30.160\nAnd here is where I could specify,\nremember switch independent mode was\n\n139\n00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.890\nthe only mode that would\noffer standby adapters.\n\n140\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.390\nI have two separate adapters here,\n\n141\n00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.800\nif I had more they would\nbe listed here as well.\n\n142\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.020\nAnd I could choose if I\nwanted to run active-active.\n\n143\n00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.880\nMeaning, I don't have\nto set it in a standby\n\n144\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.710\nadapter with switch independent mode.\n\n145\n00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:59.589\nBut, I could set active-passive, and\nhave Ethernet1 be my standby adapter.\n\n146\n00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:02.848\nOr, how about let's go ahead and\nselect Ethernet2 just to make it and\n\n147\n00:10:02.848 --> 00:10:04.020\nkinda of logical there.\n\n148\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.680\nSo Ethernet2 is my standby adapter.\n\n149\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.950\nAnd let's see here.\n\n150\n00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.040\nI think actually I wanted to show\nyou guys also one other thing.\n\n151\n00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.630\nLet's leave it.\n\n152\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:21.800\nThe default, first of all, the default\nis gonna keep it for active-active.\n\n153\n00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.570\nYou have to specify, like I just\nshowed you from that drop down,\n\n154\n00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:25.770\nif you wanna set it to standby.\n\n155\n00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.450\nI'm gonna leave it as active, so that when\nwe get in to PowerShell I can show you how\n\n156\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.880\nto switch it if you don't chose to do so.\n\n157\n00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.630\nSo let's just go ahead and\ncreate this team and we'll hit OK.\n\n158\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:43.880\nNow I wanna take a look at\nthe actual network and sharing here.\n\n159\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:50.390\nSo you can see the current status\nif I zoom in, it says identifying.\n\n160\n00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:56.105\nAnd if we check back into this interface,\nin the background here.\n\n161\n00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:01.716\nGive me one second to\nget where I wanna be.\n\n162\n00:11:05.268 --> 00:11:06.950\nOkay, this is what I wanted to show you.\n\n163\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.460\nRight here, behind my head.\n\n164\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.350\nIt says faulted connection\npending as it's building this, so\n\n165\n00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.190\nyou just wanna give it a few seconds.\n\n166\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.670\nAnd there it goes,\nstraight up to Active, so\n\n167\n00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.630\nwe know that this particular status,\nwe are good to go now.\n\n168\n00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:28.880\nNow if I go back, the reason I wanted to\nshow you network and sharing center is to\n\n169\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.770\nshow you how the actual operating\nsystem recognizes this team now.\n\n170\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.245\nSo if I write right-click on Ethernet1 and\n\n171\n00:11:37.245 --> 00:11:39.705\ngo to Properties like we\nhad looked up before.\n\n172\n00:11:39.705 --> 00:11:45.175\nNotice how I'm not utilizing the same\nconfigurations as I was before.\n\n173\n00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:49.340\nCurrently I'm using the Microsoft\nnetwork adapter multiplexer protocol.\n\n174\n00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.880\nSo we don't need to configure these\nindividual adapters separately, at this\n\n175\n00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.350\npoint in time I'm really gonna be focusing\nin on Team1, that's what we created.\n\n176\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.850\nSo let's just go ahead and right-click and\nhit Properties for Team1 and\n\n177\n00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.690\nwe can use this adapter, and\n\n178\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.820\nwe don't have to worry about those\nother adapters in the background.\n\n179\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.139\nThe operating system is handling that for\nus, so if we go in here and\n\n180\n00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:19.386\nconfigure the properties we can set things\nlike utilizing a static IP address and\n\n181\n00:12:19.386 --> 00:12:22.650\nwe're just gonna say 192.168.0.5.\n\n182\n00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.912\nOops, they're telling me,\n\n183\n00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:33.733\nyou're typing crazy lady, 168.0.5.\n\n184\n00:12:33.733 --> 00:12:35.437\nWe'll go ahead and do class c.\n\n185\n00:12:35.437 --> 00:12:37.650\nAnd I'm not gonna worry about\na default gateway here.\n\n186\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.970\nWe're not gonna try to\ngo out to the internet.\n\n187\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.350\nI will put a DNS server in here.\n\n188\n00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.610\nThis is going to be my domain\ncontroller in my lab environment.\n\n189\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:52.173\nThis is 192.168.0.1, and we'll hit OK.\n\n190\n00:12:52.173 --> 00:12:55.520\nAnd close, so you would configure it\njust as you would a regular adapter.\n\n191\n00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.688\nNothing too crazy or tricky there.\n\n192\n00:12:57.688 --> 00:13:01.694\nLet's see.\n\n193\n00:13:01.694 --> 00:13:05.430\nNow, I also wanna show\nyou let me go back in\n\n194\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.830\nthere I should've just kept that open but,\nwhat happens now\n\n195\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.054\nif one of those adapters\nwere to actually fail.\n\n196\n00:13:17.054 --> 00:13:21.010\nSo let's take Ethernet1 for\nexample, and select Disable.\n\n197\n00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.540\nNow, if we hop on over to\nour command prompt here and\n\n198\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.850\nwe'll see, monitor here, what's happening.\n\n199\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.800\nI'm still able to communicate\nwith my domain controller.\n\n200\n00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.510\nThis is where you can see how\neffective nic teaming can be\n\n201\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.710\nbecause I did have a physical hardware,\nwell\n\n202\n00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.850\nI told the software that I had a hardware\nfailure, I just disabled that adapter.\n\n203\n00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:53.050\nBut I'm still able to communicate so,\nthat is an option there.\n\n204\n00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.400\nWe'll just go ahead and re-enable that.\n\n205\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.470\nAnd you know what also,\nI wanted to show you, let's disable that.\n\n206\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:09.050\nYou can see from within the GUI\nhere that there is an issue and\n\n207\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.400\nit will give you a notification right\nthere on the interface as well.\n\n208\n00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.320\nSo If there's any kind of\nhealth degradation there,\n\n209\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320\nthat you will be alerted.\n\n210\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.445\nRight here, so here you can see\nEthernet1 is having some kind of issue,\n\n211\n00:14:21.445 --> 00:14:27.050\nyou see red and it tells you\nit's disabled, faults not found.\n\n212\n00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.290\nSo that's gonna be something that you\nwould wanna, right behind my head there,\n\n213\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:34.410\nyou would want to take a look at for\nmanagement purposes,\n\n214\n00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.860\nto see if the health status\nof all those adapters.\n\n215\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.880\nAnd you'll see on the left hand side,\nif you had multiple teams then\n\n216\n00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.560\nyou would see at least an individual\nwarning and then if you clicked on it then\n\n217\n00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.220\nyou would be able to see the specifics\nin the right hand pane there.\n\n218\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.120\nSo that's that.\n\n219\n00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.600\nI think that's all I wanted to\nshow you here from within the GUI.\n\n220\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.690\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n221\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.380\nhop on into PowerShell and\ntake a look at a few things.\n\n222\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:06.770\nSo just to understand what kind of\nadapters I may have in my system.\n\n223\n00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.460\nI can go ahead and\ntype in get net adapter,\n\n224\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.710\nand hit Enter to get an idea\nof what I'm working with.\n\n225\n00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.580\nSo, essentially this would kind of be\ncomparable to networking sharing center\n\n226\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.680\nand the GUI here to see\nwhat I have to work with.\n\n227\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:26.825\nWhat did we want to do there, let's\ntake a look at the different cmdlets.\n\n228\n00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.435\nI put a link in the show notes for\n\n229\n00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:33.965\nyou, but Ronnie's alluded to this\nquite often and I know I have as well.\n\n230\n00:15:33.965 --> 00:15:39.625\nIt's very important to be familiar\nwith our specific PowerShell cmdlets.\n\n231\n00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:43.915\nSo on this particular link,\nyou can see all the cmdlets,\n\n232\n00:15:43.915 --> 00:15:47.135\nthe ones that are pretty\ncommon are listed here.\n\n233\n00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:49.450\nAnd these are the ones that\nwe'll be working with.\n\n234\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.999\nAnd just again,\njust that verb noun syntax, and\n\n235\n00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:56.053\nit gives you a description of each one\nof these, which is really nice to have.\n\n236\n00:15:56.053 --> 00:16:03.604\nSo let's go ahead and see how we would\nperform these functions in PowerShell.\n\n237\n00:16:03.604 --> 00:16:09.440\nAnother command that I can use\ninstead of get-netadaptor,\n\n238\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.682\nI can type in get-net and\nthis is lbfoteam,\n\n239\n00:16:18.735 --> 00:16:23.066\nNow what we see here is the team name,\nI have team1, I have my adaptors,\n\n240\n00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:28.325\nindividual adaptors that are combined to\nmake up this team ethernet2 and ethernet1.\n\n241\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.670\nI can see the mode that I had selected,\nswitch independent mode.\n\n242\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.850\nI'm using the transport mode\nhashing algorithm to specify\n\n243\n00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.250\nhow that load balancing\nshould be taking place.\n\n244\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.094\nNow, this is kind of interesting,\nif we look at this section right here,\n\n245\n00:16:47.094 --> 00:16:48.651\nI see the status is degraded.\n\n246\n00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:52.720\nSo remember how we had disabled,\nI think it was ethernet1.\n\n247\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.760\nSo we still have connectivity and\n\n248\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.410\ncommunication happening,\nbut it's not a completely\n\n249\n00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:05.005\nhealthy full NIC team because we have\none adaptor that has been disabled.\n\n250\n00:17:05.005 --> 00:17:09.264\nSo what we can do here\nis actually enable that,\n\n251\n00:17:09.264 --> 00:17:13.304\nso we could do it through the GUI as well,\nbut\n\n252\n00:17:13.304 --> 00:17:18.347\nwe can also select enable dash and\nthis is netadaptor.\n\n253\n00:17:18.347 --> 00:17:24.470\nAnd I'd just need to go ahead and\nspecify the name and\n\n254\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:31.087\nthat was ethernet1,\nwe'll go ahead enable that.\n\n255\n00:17:31.087 --> 00:17:34.937\nAnd again if I were just to use\nthe same command that I did before get\n\n256\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.770\nNetLbfoTeam and hit enter.\n\n257\n00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.280\nWe should see,\nwell I guess we have to give it a second,\n\n258\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.570\nI'm a little impatient Ronnie knows that.\n\n259\n00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.640\nBut it should be coming up here\nin a few moments to go ahead and\n\n260\n00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.450\nperform that, it is identifying\nright now in the background.\n\n261\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:55.370\nSo in the graphical user interface you\nhave that little message there for you and\n\n262\n00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.180\nyou can see it happen.\n\n263\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.100\nYou don't really have that here, so\nbe aware of that, takes a few seconds.\n\n264\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.810\nBut we have our team here, so let's take\na look at how we could remove the team\n\n265\n00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.585\nthrough PowerShell, and then we'll go\nahead and create a team in PowerShell.\n\n266\n00:18:10.585 --> 00:18:12.955\nSo there's a couple different\nways that I could do that.\n\n267\n00:18:12.955 --> 00:18:18.429\nI could piggy back off of\nthe command that I had just used for\n\n268\n00:18:18.429 --> 00:18:23.457\nthe get NetLbfoTeam and\ntake that, and then pipe that\n\n269\n00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:29.517\ninto the next commandlet which\nwould be remove-NetLbfoTeam.\n\n270\n00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:37.160\nAnd that way,\nit essentially remove team one there.\n\n271\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.500\nThere's another way I could do\nthat as well and let's see,\n\n272\n00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.900\njust clear everything out.\n\n273\n00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.909\nThis is going to be remove and\n\n274\n00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:50.924\nthat's dash NetLbfoTeam.\n\n275\n00:18:50.924 --> 00:18:55.860\nAnd here you specify the name,\nyou could do that either way\n\n276\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.290\nwith with an underscore,\nit would have to be a dash,\n\n277\n00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.945\nyou could put, dash name,\nand then specify team one.\n\n278\n00:19:04.945 --> 00:19:08.977\nOr you don't have to put, it actually\nworks even if you don't do the dash and\n\n279\n00:19:08.977 --> 00:19:11.951\nthe perimeter, but\nwe'll go ahead and hit enter here.\n\n280\n00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:14.818\nAnd it asks you, hey are you sure\nyou want to perform this action,\n\n281\n00:19:14.818 --> 00:19:16.690\ndo you want to delete your team.\n\n282\n00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.640\nSo I'm just gonna hit a for\nyes to all because I am aware of that,\n\n283\n00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.110\nthat's what we wanted to do here,\nso we'll hit a and enter.\n\n284\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:31.680\nAnd if I go back to that get NetLbfoTeam\ncommandlet here and hit enter.\n\n285\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.818\nNothing happens,\n\n286\n00:19:32.818 --> 00:19:36.890\nI don't get my information because\nthat NetTeam has been removed.\n\n287\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:42.794\nAll right, so what if that was done in\nerror, by accident and I need to create or\n\n288\n00:19:42.794 --> 00:19:47.548\njust create one from the beginning,\nwe would be using the new.\n\n289\n00:19:47.548 --> 00:19:49.649\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, before we do that, let's\ngo ahead and clear the screen off, and\n\n290\n00:19:49.649 --> 00:19:50.820\nthat way we can put it at\nthe top of the screen-\n\n291\n00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.600\n&gt;&gt; Fresh start, okay.\n\n292\n00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.283\n&gt;&gt; That'll help out a little bit,\nthere you go.\n\n293\n00:19:55.283 --> 00:20:00.444\n&gt;&gt; So here in PowerShell I can\ncreate a new team by selecting new,\n\n294\n00:20:00.444 --> 00:20:03.730\nand this is going to be my NetLbfoTeam.\n\n295\n00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.520\nAnd I can add a new name here.\n\n296\n00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.634\nSo the name I want to add.\n\n297\n00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:15.600\nLet's just be super creative with\nour name space, and say, new team.\n\n298\n00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.980\nAnd it's a little bit behind that, but you\ncan see I'm just saying new teams space.\n\n299\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.350\nI also have to specify\nmy team members here.\n\n300\n00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.330\nSo my team members are actually\njust going to be my\n\n301\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.140\nactual adaptors that I'm selecting.\n\n302\n00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.274\nI'm only selecting two here, but\nremember we can have additional adaptors.\n\n303\n00:20:37.274 --> 00:20:42.507\nI have ethernet1 and I also have,\n\n304\n00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:49.911\nmake sure I'm typing this right,\nethernet2.\n\n305\n00:20:49.911 --> 00:20:52.329\nIt's a single quote,\nI put a double quote in there, so\n\n306\n00:20:52.329 --> 00:20:53.970\nI just wanna change that real quick.\n\n307\n00:20:57.535 --> 00:20:59.616\nThat, too.\n\n308\n00:20:59.616 --> 00:21:04.785\nAnd if you hit space, dash,\nconfirm and colon dollar sign false,\n\n309\n00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:10.879\nI'm specifying here that I want to bypass\nthose little notifications that you\n\n310\n00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:17.700\nwould normally see if there saying hey are\nyou sure you want to perform this action.\n\n311\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.933\nYou don't have to have that, otherwise\nyou would see what we saw when we tried\n\n312\n00:21:20.933 --> 00:21:23.048\nto remove it with that\nnotification that came up.\n\n313\n00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:28.140\nSo here I can see my new\nteam that we just created.\n\n314\n00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.750\nThe name new team,\nsame adaptors that we had used before.\n\n315\n00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.120\nSame configuration here new team,\nswitch independent.\n\n316\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.190\nAlthough it does have the dynamic\nconfiguration which is interesting there.\n\n317\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.820\nNow the status is noted as being down.\n\n318\n00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.270\nSometimes you'll just\nneed to come back and\n\n319\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.800\ncheck on that to make sure\neverything's copacetic here.\n\n320\n00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.170\nBecause it does take a few minutes for\nthe system, or a few seconds I should say.\n\n321\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.680\nIt shouldn't take a few minutes,\n\n322\n00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.860\nbut that's that word shouldn't\nwhen you're dealing with tech.\n\n323\n00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.760\nBut anyways, so\nnow that we've created our new team,\n\n324\n00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.170\nwe can even hop back into the GUI just\nto verify that it does in fact exist.\n\n325\n00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.560\nSo we can click on that.\n\n326\n00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.371\nHere we can see the stats for\nour new team.\n\n327\n00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:13.546\nWe can see the adapters on\nthe right hand pane over here.\n\n328\n00:22:13.546 --> 00:22:18.298\nI can see that both of those adapters\nare up and they're active, and good and\n\n329\n00:22:18.298 --> 00:22:20.090\nhealthy, good to go there.\n\n330\n00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:26.670\nSo it's really not difficult and you can\nsee that just from creating adding and\n\n331\n00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:31.180\nremoving different teams within\nthe graphical user interface also\n\n332\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.190\nin PowerShell here.\n\n333\n00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.380\nI'm trying to think if there's anything,\nyou can remove individual members, so\n\n334\n00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:42.540\nif I had multiple network\nadaptors in that particular team,\n\n335\n00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.760\nand I said hey I didn't want to\ngo ahead and keep that number.\n\n336\n00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.000\nAs part of that team\nthere are some remove,\n\n337\n00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.270\nlet me see,\ndid you have a question Ronnie?\n\n338\n00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes, before you go into removing\nsomething since we're all ready here,\n\n339\n00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.310\nI think in PowerShell we can also\n\n340\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:05.460\nchange the configuration right from the\nactive active to standby if we need to.\n\n341\n00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.730\nIs that something we can do?\n\n342\n00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that is something that\nwe can do here, excuse you.\n\n343\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:13.780\nSo, let's see here,\nlet me just verify in the GUI and\n\n344\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.510\nshow you like we had seen before.\n\n345\n00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:20.110\nIf we go ahead and click on our new team,\nwe can see under the additional\n\n346\n00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:26.250\nproperties that nothing is selected\nhere for a load balancing mode.\n\n347\n00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:31.690\nAnd I don't have any kind of\nstandby adapter selected as well.\n\n348\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.630\nSo you can add additional configurations\n\n349\n00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.230\nvia PowerShell with\ndifferent parameters there.\n\n350\n00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.380\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that, let's change that.\n\n351\n00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.510\nI think I had mentioned that before\nwe wanted to do that anyways.\n\n352\n00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:46.539\nSo, here if I type in get net,\n\n353\n00:23:46.539 --> 00:23:52.828\nthis is going to be our net,\nLbfoTean member,\n\n354\n00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:59.627\nlet me just make sure I am\ndoing the right one here.\n\n355\n00:23:59.627 --> 00:24:03.333\nYep, so\nhere I have to specify the team member,\n\n356\n00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:06.207\nI'm calling it out individually and\n\n357\n00:24:06.207 --> 00:24:12.562\nWe had before we're talking about\nsetting Ethernet two as our stand by so.\n\n358\n00:24:12.562 --> 00:24:15.370\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Cherokee if your\ngonna set this we probably need to do\n\n359\n00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.720\na set instead of a get right?\n\n360\n00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.180\n&gt;&gt; This is true, sorry about that Ronnie.\n\n361\n00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.240\n&gt;&gt; No, just wanna make sure.\n\n362\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.544\n&gt;&gt; Let me go back.\n&gt;&gt; Just [LAUGH] just\n\n363\n00:24:21.544 --> 00:24:23.960\nwanted to make sure before we\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n364\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.835\n&gt;&gt; We did that.\n\n365\n00:24:24.835 --> 00:24:29.240\nSo yeah, the get right that would show\nus the information that we needed, but\n\n366\n00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.660\nactually saving it,\nto change what we want,\n\n367\n00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.560\nthat's also something we want\nto make sure that as well.\n\n368\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.200\nThis is the difference on the exam\nbetween giving something write and\n\n369\n00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.710\nwrong as you actually go ahead and\nconfigure [INAUDIBLE].\n\n370\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.648\nSo, Cherokee is showing us\nthe actual syntax right now.\n\n371\n00:24:45.648 --> 00:24:49.050\nSet the NetLbfoTeam member,\n\n372\n00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:53.018\nI know this is a little bit small\neven from this distance here.\n\n373\n00:24:53.018 --> 00:24:57.760\nAnd what she's doing is she now setting it\nto being that standby and she has chosen\n\n374\n00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.270\nthe network adapter that she is actually\ngonna put in that stand by mode, right?\n\n375\n00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.272\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so that's going to be\nEthernet2 that we have here and\n\n376\n00:25:05.272 --> 00:25:10.780\nit just says set Netlbfo team members\nspace name, we specify Ethernet2.\n\n377\n00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.310\nThen we add that parameter here for\nadministrative mode and\n\n378\n00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.340\nthen we specify standby,\nand we'll hit Enter.\n\n379\n00:25:18.855 --> 00:25:21.525\nNothing major happens here,\nso if we wanna go back and\n\n380\n00:25:21.525 --> 00:25:25.100\ncheck that we could use,\nlet's see which one.\n\n381\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.975\nThere's a couple of different ways of\ndoing this here, but if I type in I should\n\n382\n00:25:29.975 --> 00:25:35.313\nbe able to get my member here.\n\n383\n00:25:35.313 --> 00:25:38.769\nSo get Netlbfo member, team member.\n\n384\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.497\nEthernet2, I think this all show\nme if I get rid of that semicolon,\n\n385\n00:25:54.497 --> 00:25:57.181\nthere's no place in here for that.\n\n386\n00:26:00.855 --> 00:26:03.410\nSo by using that get command,\nthe difference.\n\n387\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.250\nLike Ronnie is saying,\nit seems like a very small difference.\n\n388\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.980\nBut in fact, in actuality,\nit is a huge difference there.\n\n389\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:14.630\nSo don't do as I do here, but for\nthat you can see the name, right?\n\n390\n00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.390\nAnd, now the administrative mode,\nthis is what we had changed there.\n\n391\n00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:22.481\nWe had set it to standby mode,\nso now effectively before and\n\n392\n00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:25.670\nthere's a couple of different\nways you can check that as well.\n\n393\n00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:30.746\nIf we type in Get-NetLbfo and\n\n394\n00:26:30.746 --> 00:26:37.247\nthen this is just going to be our team.\n\n395\n00:26:37.247 --> 00:26:40.028\nThis gives you this statistics,\n\n396\n00:26:40.028 --> 00:26:44.410\nthe Get-NetLbfoTeam for\nthat entire group there.\n\n397\n00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.160\nAnd you can see that it is up.\n\n398\n00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.050\nHold on, there is one more\nthat I wanted to show you.\n\n399\n00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.905\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, so let's make sure\nthat we understand what we've just done\n\n400\n00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:56.340\nhere, as we've changed everything from\nactive now to standby Let's review for\n\n401\n00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.220\na moment so that everybody gets it Mike.\n\n402\n00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.320\nWe did talk about in a previous episode,\nwhat does this do to our bandwidth?\n\n403\n00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:06.630\n&gt;&gt; So if you recall we did say that by\nputting one of those adapters in standby,\n\n404\n00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:10.600\nwe would have to have it sit\nthere as it's being reserved.\n\n405\n00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.430\nSo, if you think about\nthe logic behind all of that,\n\n406\n00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:18.330\nwe're essentially decreasing our\navailable bandwidth from that team,\n\n407\n00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.200\nif it were an active,\nactive we would have 2 gigs.\n\n408\n00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.280\nAnd in this configuration with standby,\n\n409\n00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.370\nwere dropping it down to 1\ngig with that one in reserve.\n\n410\n00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.314\nThat's why i wanted to show you,\n\n411\n00:27:27.314 --> 00:27:30.365\nthere are some commands that actually\nshow you the speed and the statistics.\n\n412\n00:27:30.365 --> 00:27:33.190\nEither also check within the GUI as well,\nbut\n\n413\n00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:37.170\ni really just wanna solidify that concept\nbecause its really a staple here.\n\n414\n00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.110\nIt's something you have to know.\n\n415\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.340\nAll right, Cherokee, sounds good.\n\n416\n00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:44.230\nAre there any other commands\nthat we wanna take a look at.\n\n417\n00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:48.200\n&gt;&gt; I do wanna point something out,\nit may seem pretty cosmetic.\n\n418\n00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.055\nBut something even like renaming.\n\n419\n00:27:51.055 --> 00:27:55.435\nThe name of that team can cause brief\ninterruptions with your communication.\n\n420\n00:27:55.435 --> 00:27:57.875\nSo I mean, if that might not\nseem like a big deal ahead,\n\n421\n00:27:57.875 --> 00:27:59.195\nI just wanted to rename this team.\n\n422\n00:27:59.195 --> 00:28:02.345\nBut it can cause interruptions, so\nI do want you to be aware of that,\n\n423\n00:28:02.345 --> 00:28:05.525\nand I'll just show you real quick\nsince we're already in PowerShell.\n\n424\n00:28:05.525 --> 00:28:09.045\nLet me clear my screen, and\n\n425\n00:28:09.045 --> 00:28:12.295\nyou can also change the name within\nthe GUI, it's pretty simple, but\n\n426\n00:28:12.295 --> 00:28:17.860\nyou just type in if I can type that\nwould really help the situation here.\n\n427\n00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:25.370\nSo we say rename NetLbfo and we'll have\nto specify our current name here so\n\n428\n00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:31.442\nthe current name here so,\nI think we had went with new team.\n\n429\n00:28:31.442 --> 00:28:35.352\nAnd that's the old name goes first, and\n\n430\n00:28:35.352 --> 00:28:40.660\nthen specify-newname and\nthe new name Ronnie.\n\n431\n00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:41.300\n&gt;&gt; Team two.\n\n432\n00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.445\n&gt;&gt; Team two, okay.\n\n433\n00:28:42.445 --> 00:28:47.490\n[LAUGH] Team two, and we'll go ahead and\n\n434\n00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.580\nhit Enter, and if I can pull up that\ncommand prompt real quick from the back.\n\n435\n00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.510\nI just wanna check to see if we\ndo see any kind of issues here.\n\n436\n00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.380\nIt looks like we're good so far, but\n\n437\n00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.520\nI was kinda curious actually trying\nto do experiment here in real time.\n\n438\n00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.180\nI've see it before where\nit actually causes\n\n439\n00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.330\na brief like request time out there so\njust kinda be aware of that.\n\n440\n00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.820\nWe look good to go.\n\n441\n00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:13.960\nAnd then also you can just check that\nwith the get- then adapter here.\n\n442\n00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.455\nSee this is why, [LAUGH].\n\n443\n00:29:18.455 --> 00:29:22.235\n[LAUGH] I type everything out here.\n\n444\n00:29:22.235 --> 00:29:26.612\nGet-NetLb, no I betch you it all,\nthere you go.\n\n445\n00:29:26.612 --> 00:29:33.635\nTeam and we can hit info and\nenter not info, and here you can see that,\n\n446\n00:29:33.635 --> 00:29:39.910\nthat name has been changed to the fabulous\nteam two, and the status is up, it's good.\n\n447\n00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.490\nSo I think that's a good place for\n\n448\n00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.910\nyou to get your feet wet here\nplaying in both PowerShell.\n\n449\n00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.370\nUse that link that I gave you because\nthere's a lot more that you can configure\n\n450\n00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:53.600\nfrom PowerShell as well as the GUI here,\nso hope that works.\n\n451\n00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\nthank you again for\n\n452\n00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.070\nshowing us how to actually\nGet-NetLbfoTeam configured.\n\n453\n00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.470\nWe did take a look at\nthe configuration using of course\n\n454\n00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.620\nthe GUI interface as well\nthrough the Server Manager.\n\n455\n00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.630\nAnd now even PowerShell.\n\n456\n00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:12.120\nMake sure you concentrate on both,\nit's a little bit difficult to actually\n\n457\n00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.750\nsay you can concentrate on one or\nthe other, but as Microsoft is progressing\n\n458\n00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.490\nwith exams you can see more, more in\nPowerShell, so you can't neglect that.\n\n459\n00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:21.350\nBut at the same time,\n\n460\n00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.180\nthey're not gonna let you get away\nwithout knowing their GUI either.\n\n461\n00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.410\nSo spend time in both,\ntake a look at these commands,\n\n462\n00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:31.140\nmake sure you understand what you can\nactually do to not only configure them,\n\n463\n00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.930\nbut to verify the information\nif you need to.\n\n464\n00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.010\nThat's the differences between\nsome good points on the exam and,\n\n465\n00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.170\nnot getting any points on the exam.\n\n466\n00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.100\nSo make sure you pay attention there.\n\n467\n00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.520\nWell that's a great place for\nus to then sign off for this episode.\n\n468\n00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.507\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n469\n00:30:48.507 --> 00:30:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA, 70-410 show.\n\n470\n00:30:52.900 --> 00:31:00.003\n[MUSIC]\n\n471\n00:31:00.003 --> 00:31:03.116\nThank you

Cherokee explains that permissions are normally inherited from the root of the file system to subfolders below it.  Also, she explains and demonstrates what happens to permissions when you create a new subfolder and add a group to it.  When using NTFS permissions with users and a groups, these permissions may be cumulative if the user is a member of multiple groups, with the exception of denies, says Cherokee.  Lastly, she demonstrates how to disable inheritance and remove a group from the DACL.",

00:00:08.288\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:11.435\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:14.809\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.560\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.423\nAnd we're gonna be taking a look\nspecifically at exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:28.280\nToday, we're diving into the topic of\nwell, configuring NTFS permissions.\n\n9\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.170\nAnd here to help us out today of course,\nis gonna be Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.650\nCherokee, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.520\nHow are you today?\n\n13\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.640\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n14\n00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.690\nNow Cherokee, as we begin, as we start\nto take a look NTFS permissions,\n\n15\n00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.190\nthese are things that we've\ncovered multiple times,\n\n16\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.840\nif we've done any type of\ncertification training.\n\n17\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.070\nUp in this point as we start seeing our\nMCSA, there's a lot for us to actually\n\n18\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.550\ncover, and even though a lot of it\nmight be review, it is a good topic.\n\n19\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.440\nSo where are we gonna pick up on today?\n\n20\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie.\nYou bring up a really good point because\n\n21\n00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.780\na lot of the information that\nis included for this exam,\n\n22\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.470\nMicrosoft assumes that you all ready have\nthat knowledge and that information.\n\n23\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.828\nSo to see it being brought in as an\nobjective and being emphasized even more.\n\n24\n00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:11.498\nObviously, that just goes to\nshow how important it really is,\n\n25\n00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:16.282\nespecially in the production environment\nbecause this really is one of those main\n\n26\n00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:20.256\nduties that a system admin has as\nfar as following back on security.\n\n27\n00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:25.143\nAnd implementing different concepts such\nas the principal of lease privilege and\n\n28\n00:01:25.143 --> 00:01:29.150\nrelease securing and\nlocking down data within your environment.\n\n29\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.500\nSo Microsoft has integrated a way we don't\nhave to use any third party software,\n\n30\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.340\nwe have more than enough\ndifferent types of permissions and\n\n31\n00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.940\nways to configure permissions\nwithin this operating system here.\n\n32\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.050\nSo, I think just having a good\nunderstanding of what these permissions\n\n33\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.010\nare, how they should be applied and then\nknowing the different options of ways that\n\n34\n00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.860\nyou can configure them\nwould be the best bet here.\n\n35\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.489\n&gt;&gt; And we find out the complexity of these\nreally comes when we start adding in users\n\n36\n00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:59.096\nand groups.\n\n37\n00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:02.504\nAnd then of course when those users\nget added into different groups,\n\n38\n00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:06.630\nall of the sudden, NTFS permissions\ncan be a little bit more challenging.\n\n39\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.586\nSo even if this sounds\na little bit confusing,\n\n40\n00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:11.159\nmake sure you watch this show\na couple of times if you need to.\n\n41\n00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.817\nBecause it's really something\nthat you're gonna see in\n\n42\n00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:17.260\njust about every single Microsoft\nexam that you have to recover.\n\n43\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.547\nSo get a good foundation here and you'll\nprobably see us present this over and\n\n44\n00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:22.583\nover again even during\nthe entire MCSA series.\n\n45\n00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:25.920\nAll right so Cherokee,\nwhat are we gonna take a look at first?\n\n46\n00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think we should really\njust point out the fact that we\n\n47\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.460\nare specifically talking about NTFS\npermissions, there are additional types of\n\n48\n00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.430\npermissions out there that we will cover\nin the next couple of episodes here.\n\n49\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.940\nBut first of all,\nyou have to have an NTFS file system.\n\n50\n00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.130\nSo, a new technology file system, brings\nto the table these integrated permissions.\n\n51\n00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.620\nIf were talking about FAT32,\nsome of those old file systems.\n\n52\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.350\nJust know, it is an option for you to\nutilize that but we've already covered\n\n53\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.650\nthat and said, hey, we really should be\nusing NTFS for our bootable volumes here.\n\n54\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.860\nI think they only had just\na very limited scope,\n\n55\n00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.740\nif you're talking about those older file\nsystems but here we have quite a few.\n\n56\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.560\nSo I think that's where\nwe should start and\n\n57\n00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.990\njust take a look at maybe\neven creating a folder.\n\n58\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.700\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nlet's do that.\n\n59\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.465\nI'll just pull up file explorer here and\n\n60\n00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:26.280\nlet's just work on my actual root.\n\n61\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.410\nI don't think I've created any kind\nof sub folders here, that's fine.\n\n62\n00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.320\nNow, files and folders they do have\nslightly different NTFS permissions.\n\n63\n00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.590\nAnd so, when we look at those\nyou'll see what I mean.\n\n64\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.370\nA lot of this though Ronnie is somewhat\nlogical when you're going about it,\n\n65\n00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.720\nit's just getting familiar with\nactually exercising it here.\n\n66\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.320\nSo I'm just gonna right click and\nselect New &gt; Folder here and\n\n67\n00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.180\nso Ronnie and I were talking\nabout just different analogies or\n\n68\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.260\ninstances because there could be so many\non how you want to implement permissions.\n\n69\n00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.150\nAnd if you think about it these are gonna\nbe your rights that you're allowing others\n\n70\n00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.070\nwithin your environment and\nit's not just users.\n\n71\n00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.767\nIt can be users, groups and even computers\nand that's something that a lot of people\n\n72\n00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:18.937\ndon't think about, as well is maybe I\nhave two particular machines that we\n\n73\n00:04:18.937 --> 00:04:22.936\nonly want those two machines to be\nable to communicate with each other.\n\n74\n00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:25.710\nSo you can apply permissions\nto computers as well.\n\n75\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.680\nSo that's something to think about.\n\n76\n00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.140\nThe analogy that we decided to\nrun with here was show ideas.\n\n77\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.680\nSo here at ITProTV,\nwe come up with our shows right?\n\n78\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.380\nSo maybe Don asked us hosts.\n\n79\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.850\nOkay guys, I need you to come\nup with some show ideas.\n\n80\n00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.330\nMaybe there's some kind of spiff or\nincentive for\n\n81\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.170\nthe individual who has\nthe best show idea ever.\n\n82\n00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.870\nSo we'll take a look at how I can\nkeep that information safe so\n\n83\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.370\nthat Ronnie doesn't spy and\npeek at all my great show ideas.\n\n84\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.590\nAnd it's really easy here.\n\n85\n00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.389\nWe just right click and select Properties.\n\n86\n00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.470\nNow for the Security tab right here,\nand let me move this over,\n\n87\n00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.050\nso it's not behind me.\n\n88\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.724\nThey called this Security tab,\nbut this is really a DACL,\n\n89\n00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:17.533\na Discretionary Access Control List.\n\n90\n00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:23.535\nAnd we're implementing that access\ncontrol based upon our triple A ideas,\n\n91\n00:05:23.535 --> 00:05:25.702\nso if you think about that.\n\n92\n00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:32.222\nSo we've authenticated, most likely\nyou're utilizing a domain environment.\n\n93\n00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:37.440\nAnd now the system is identifying and\ncomparing the SID and\n\n94\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.330\ntheir access token and comparing it to\nthis access list on whatever resource\n\n95\n00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.960\nyou're trying to access to grant rights or\ndeny them.\n\n96\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.980\nJust depending on how your\nsystem is configured.\n\n97\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.210\nAnd each one of these components here,\nsuch as the creator owner,\n\n98\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.440\nthe system, the administrator's group,\nand users group are integrated.\n\n99\n00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.750\nI didn't just create them.\n\n100\n00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.810\nYou saw me, we just created this\nfolder and the system built them.\n\n101\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.100\nAnd so that's something you'd\nwanna think about as well,\n\n102\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.230\nwhich ones are going to\nbe used by the system.\n\n103\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.400\nHow should we handle those permissions?\n\n104\n00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.480\nAnd we'll take a look at that\nbecause sometimes for example,\n\n105\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.280\nwith this users group.\n\n106\n00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.514\nWe might not want to utilize this users\ngroup and I might just want to set\n\n107\n00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:26.330\nspecific types of groups within Active\nDirectory to really control access here.\n\n108\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.370\nSo before the show, I actually\ncreated a couple different groups.\n\n109\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.240\nOne group I created was the hosts group.\n\n110\n00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.650\nSo all the hosts at ITProTV can get\nplaced into an Active Directory\n\n111\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.460\ngroup and so in this situation,\nit's a security group and\n\n112\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.590\nI can apply different policies and\ndifferent permissions to that group.\n\n113\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.420\nAnd why would I wanna do that instead\nof each individual host you may ask.\n\n114\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.530\nAnd that's because well, for\n\n115\n00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.720\nsimplified administration instead of going\nand how many hosts do we have, Ronnie?\n\n116\n00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.470\nI don't even know.\n\n117\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.350\nMaybe, let's say we have ten hosts.\n\n118\n00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.460\nSo, I would have to go and perform that\nfunction ten times, rather than one.\n\n119\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.460\nSo it's really about working smarter,\nnot harder here.\n\n120\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.170\nAs long as everything is configured\ncorrectly that's the key with permissions.\n\n121\n00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:23.240\nSo let's say Ronnie was in charge of\nmanaging and maintaining these show ideas?\n\n122\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:29.690\nMaybe he was the project head for you know\nhelping Don choose the bests ideas here.\n\n123\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.040\nSo maybe I put Ronnie in\nsome kind of elevated group.\n\n124\n00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.760\nSo I just put him in the manager's group.\n\n125\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.900\nSo maybe he's the host's manager.\n\n126\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.370\nSo when we think about permissions in\nTFS permissions, they're cumulative.\n\n127\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.917\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n128\n00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:47.790\nSo it means that they add and they\nbuild upon each other so for instance,\n\n129\n00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:53.166\nevery permission or right that was\ngranted with that host group, Ronnie has.\n\n130\n00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:57.812\nBut then maybe I have elevated\npermissions with the managers group and\n\n131\n00:07:57.812 --> 00:08:03.000\nwhen they get combined together,\nthe highest is going to rule out here.\n\n132\n00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.760\nNow we'll see how that interacts\nwith share permissions which we'll\n\n133\n00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.407\ncover a little bit later on down the road.\n\n134\n00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:12.964\nBut let's take a look at actually how we\ncan implement this in real life, so on our\n\n135\n00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:18.550\nshow ideas folder here, I don't have\nRonnie or any kind of additional groups.\n\n136\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.656\nSo it's really easy to just\nclick this Edit button and\n\n137\n00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:25.036\nwe can go ahead and select Add.\n\n138\n00:08:25.036 --> 00:08:32.330\nNow, this is where you see those\npre configured options down here.\n\n139\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.800\nLet's just take a look at those,\nlet me zoom in a little bit.\n\n140\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.100\nThe first one we see here is going\nto be full control on the list.\n\n141\n00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.820\nSo there are six options that\nMicrosoft has really just\n\n142\n00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.770\ngrouped together and provided for you for\neasy access here right in this window.\n\n143\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.460\nAnd we'll take a look at another\nway that we can really fine tune at\n\n144\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.820\na granular level,\nadditional special permissions.\n\n145\n00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:04.830\nBut really, you kind of wanna shy\naway from any kind of one offs here,\n\n146\n00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.670\noutliers because it just make management\na little more difficult in the long run.\n\n147\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.133\nSo when we take a look at Full control.\n\n148\n00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:13.697\nFull control is going to,\n\n149\n00:09:13.697 --> 00:09:19.530\nif you click on that box you can\nsee everything that fill in.\n\n150\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.150\nJust kind of like it sounds it\nallows you to be able to Modify,\n\n151\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.370\nRead and Execute, List folder contents.\n\n152\n00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.480\nAnd remember when I said that files and\nfolders will be slightly different.\n\n153\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.920\nSo obviously, List folder contents is only\ngonna be applying to folder type objects.\n\n154\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.770\nSo with this you also get the Read\npermissions meaning being about to view\n\n155\n00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.430\nthe contents of that folder as well\nas viewing the individual contents.\n\n156\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.260\nAnd we'll talk about\ninheritance in a few moments.\n\n157\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.610\nAnd then Write.\n\n158\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.100\nSo Write being able to write,\nadd objects to that folder.\n\n159\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.480\nNow Full control also means that\nI'm able to take ownership.\n\n160\n00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.090\nI'm able to manage the actual attributes\nfor that particular object as well.\n\n161\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.390\nSo this is the most that I\ncould give someone here,\n\n162\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.570\nthe most control if you will.\n\n163\n00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.207\nAnd if we take a look at just Modify here.\n\n164\n00:10:13.207 --> 00:10:16.536\nSo Modify allows us to well,\n\n165\n00:10:16.536 --> 00:10:23.048\nlike the name implies\nmodify the individual file.\n\n166\n00:10:23.048 --> 00:10:30.080\nNow when modify is kind of a lot of people\nwhen they look at Modify and Write.\n\n167\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.820\nThey get those two confused sometimes.\n\n168\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.583\nBecause if you think about it,\nwell with Write, I could go in and\n\n169\n00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:39.999\nopen the document and\nmodify that document and falsify and\n\n170\n00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:44.420\nput incorrect information to\nsabotage an organization, right?\n\n171\n00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.195\nWell, if you think you're giving\nthem just that capability,\n\n172\n00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:53.030\nit's still an issue because\nyou have to think about that.\n\n173\n00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.440\nWhat if they do maliciously\nmodify this information.\n\n174\n00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.930\nBut with the actual Modify command or\npermission, I should say.\n\n175\n00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.930\nYou'll also have the ability\nto delete that object.\n\n176\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.430\nSo that's the big difference\nbetween those two there.\n\n177\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:15.400\nRead and\nexecute if it were able to be executed, if\n\n178\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.150\nit was a type of executable object, then\nthis particular permission would apply.\n\n179\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.660\nList folder contents I explained what\nthat was, pretty self explanatory there.\n\n180\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.630\nAnd then Read and Write.\n\n181\n00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.290\nSo we'll take a look at Special\npermissions in a few moments.\n\n182\n00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.280\nThose are gonna be those really granular\nfine tune ones like I was talking about.\n\n183\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.100\nBut those are the most common types of\npermissions that will be dealing with\n\n184\n00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.540\nhere within an operating system.\n\n185\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.700\nNow, who can I assign these\npermissions to, right, our aces.\n\n186\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.220\nSo if I didn't want to utilize\none of these pre configured aces,\n\n187\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.080\nthan I can add my own in very easily.\n\n188\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.480\nAs long as I already set them up and\nmanaged them in Active Directory\n\n189\n00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.710\nunder users and computers, so here\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee,\n\n190\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.640\nyou've actually-\n&gt;&gt; Changed.\n\n191\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou've changed that in the creator owner.\n\n192\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.850\nIs that gonna matter?\n\n193\n00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n194\n00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.856\nSo let me just hit Cancel,\nnow here's the thing.\n\n195\n00:12:07.856 --> 00:12:13.190\nIf you want to go ahead and\npush those changes out directly.\n\n196\n00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.960\nYou can hit Apply before you hit OK.\n\n197\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.120\nBut I just hit Cancel, so\n\n198\n00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.610\nthat I don't mess anything up\nthere because here's the thing.\n\n199\n00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:29.530\nPermissions are very unforgiving in\nthe sense that, if I were to put something\n\n200\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:35.400\non lockdown to the extent where I wasn't\nable to reaccess that information.\n\n201\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.520\nThat can happen here and\nit can really hose you up.\n\n202\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.860\nAnd we'll take a look at when we\nworking with disabling inheritance.\n\n203\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.450\nSometimes that does happen, so you have\nto be really careful about doing that.\n\n204\n00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.949\nSo thanks for keeping an eye out Ronnie.\n\n205\n00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.270\nAll right, so yeah,\nwe don't wanna modify anything as of yet.\n\n206\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.620\nWe're just trying to add\nanother ace in here all right.\n\n207\n00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:03.450\nSo we'll hit Edit and,\n[COUGH] We're going to hit Add.\n\n208\n00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.430\nNow, you could type the name in.\n\n209\n00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:09.790\nI'm just going to type in Host and\nhit Check Names.\n\n210\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.486\nAs long as it becomes underlined.\n\n211\n00:13:12.486 --> 00:13:18.429\nAnd I need to authenticate the first\ntime around because I'm accessing that,\n\n212\n00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:21.140\nso, let me just do that real quick.\n\n213\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.329\nShouldn't ask me again, but notice how\nmy Hosts is now underlined because\n\n214\n00:13:27.329 --> 00:13:32.015\nthe system was able to find this hosts\ngroup within an Active Directory.\n\n215\n00:13:32.015 --> 00:13:38.400\nSo we'll just hit OK, and\nlet's also Add in our managers group.\n\n216\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.136\nCheck names and there we go.\n\n217\n00:13:43.674 --> 00:13:49.390\nSo if we look at both of these there\nare some integrated options here.\n\n218\n00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.930\nThe system has already selected some but\n\n219\n00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:57.830\nI really need to control how I want\nthis particular folder accessed.\n\n220\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:06.220\nSo I said that the hosts should be able\nto add information into this folder.\n\n221\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.720\nAnd then Ronnie in the managers group,\nshould be able to check and\n\n222\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.020\nhelp Don decide which show\nideas would be the best.\n\n223\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.050\nSo in practical, other use case\nscenarios where might we use this.\n\n224\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.670\nWell, let's think about this,\nperhaps I'm an instructor for\n\n225\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.970\na school and I had students that\nwanted to submit their homework.\n\n226\n00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.530\nOr you can even think about this in a lot\nof practical applications, now a days we\n\n227\n00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:34.160\nutilized concepts like Dropbox and\nother solutions out there, OneDrive.\n\n228\n00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.130\nWhere people are putting information in\na public storage area, but you don't want\n\n229\n00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.620\nthose individual files and documents being\naccessed by all who have those rights.\n\n230\n00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.212\nSo that's what we're\nkind of looking at here.\n\n231\n00:14:44.212 --> 00:14:47.521\nAnd there are a lot of different ways\nto configure these permissions but\n\n232\n00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:50.400\nthis is just one example that I\nwanted to show you first of all.\n\n233\n00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.890\nSo, for our hosts let's go ahead and\n\n234\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.980\nchange that to only\nhave Write permissions.\n\n235\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.960\nAnd I will deselect these others here.\n\n236\n00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.570\nAnd I will also note that deny permissions\n\n237\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.850\nare going to be over writing\nany assigned permissions,\n\n238\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.970\nwell I say any but\nthere is one particular situation that is\n\n239\n00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.100\nan exception that we'll take a look at\na little bit later on down the road.\n\n240\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.900\nBut deny permissions should be\nutilized with great caution\n\n241\n00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.690\nbecause they are such\na strong permission here and\n\n242\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.250\nthey do override these configurations\nthat I'm setting right here.\n\n243\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.860\nSo that's something you'd\nwanna keep in mind.\n\n244\n00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.620\nOkay, so now I just have Write\npermissions set for our host folder.\n\n245\n00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.490\nSo I'll go ahead and select Apply.\n\n246\n00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.403\nNow, I will point out that\nthis users group here.\n\n247\n00:15:44.403 --> 00:15:49.076\nIf you look at that, the operating\nsystem has already selected those.\n\n248\n00:15:49.076 --> 00:15:52.347\nAnd they're gray here because these.\n\n249\n00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:56.931\nThese permissions have been inherited\nfrom my root, from my C drive here so\n\n250\n00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:01.000\nthat's also something that\nI'll have to think about.\n\n251\n00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.360\nI have to completely clear permissions\nbefore I can delete an actual ace and\n\n252\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.820\naccess control entry here.\n\n253\n00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.460\nSo that is something to consider as well,\nI would need to go through and\n\n254\n00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.140\ndisable that inheritance before it\ncan actually delete that users group.\n\n255\n00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.650\nBecause as of now, as it stands,\n\n256\n00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:24.090\nif I were to log in as another host,\nlike Zack for instance.\n\n257\n00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.720\nZack would also fall under\nthis users category and\n\n258\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.970\nif you look here, we have read and\nexecute capabilities.\n\n259\n00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:36.290\nWe have list folder content permissions\nand we also have read permissions,\n\n260\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.550\nas well as some special permissions.\n\n261\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:45.280\nSo in addition to just that right\npermission, that's kinda work around.\n\n262\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.820\nSo that's something that\nwe have to be careful of.\n\n263\n00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.560\nAnd it's just all about getting in\nthere and playing around and checking.\n\n264\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.750\nChecking to make sure that everything was\nconfigured the way you want it to be.\n\n265\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:59.910\nBecause sometimes users will be\nable to gain more access than\n\n266\n00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.470\nwhat they really should have and do you\nthink they're gonna tell you about that?\n\n267\n00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.470\nMaybe, but not always.\n\n268\n00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so\n\n269\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.430\nlet me make sure I get this straight\nin my mind what you're saying.\n\n270\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.900\nIf Zach is a part of the users group,\nas well as a part of the host group,\n\n271\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.787\nthen those permissions,\neven though they're different.\n\n272\n00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:20.471\nHe's gonna end up with the cumulative\npermission is that what your saying?\n\n273\n00:17:20.471 --> 00:17:21.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n274\n00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.088\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna end up with those cumulative\n\n275\n00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:29.301\npermissions unless, I explicitly assign\na denied permission to prohibit that and\n\n276\n00:17:29.301 --> 00:17:34.066\nlike I said, I really don't wanna be\njust being wishy washy with my denies or\n\n277\n00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:37.580\nhanding them out,\ndoling them out like that commonly.\n\n278\n00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:43.430\nSo perhaps a better suggestion or\nbusiness model would\n\n279\n00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:48.970\nbe to remove that users group and create\nmy custom groups and just stick to those.\n\n280\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.923\nAnd that's really what it's all about is,\ncoming up with a plan and sticking it to\n\n281\n00:17:52.923 --> 00:17:56.444\nit so that everyone in your IT department\nis on board with that same plan.\n\n282\n00:17:56.444 --> 00:17:58.980\nAnd you don't have these random denies and\n\n283\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.502\nspecial permissions just kind of\nlingering out there in your environment.\n\n284\n00:18:03.502 --> 00:18:08.531\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at how we can actually\n\n285\n00:18:08.531 --> 00:18:14.470\ndemonstrate how Zack may or\nmay not be able to gain access.\n\n286\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:18.570\nOkay, so first things first,\nlet's take care of this issue that we have\n\n287\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.320\nof these pre existing inherited\npermissions for this users group.\n\n288\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.130\nBecause I'm not gonna be able\nto delete this access control\n\n289\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.740\nentry unless those permissions are gone.\n\n290\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.580\nIf we select Edit, and\nattempt to delete those, this entry here.\n\n291\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.830\nSo make sure it is highlighted and\nselect Remove.\n\n292\n00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:41.460\nNotice how I get a notification that says,\nyou can't remove the user's\n\n293\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.760\nobject here because this object is\ninheriting permissions from its parent.\n\n294\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.900\nTo remove users, you must prevent this\nobject from inheriting permissions.\n\n295\n00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.220\nTurn off the option for\ninheriting permissions and\n\n296\n00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.600\nthen try removing users again.\n\n297\n00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.840\nSo that's what we need to do.\n\n298\n00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.220\nAnd if you just think about\nthis concept of inheritance.\n\n299\n00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.640\nIt's very similar to real life.\n\n300\n00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.232\nNormally, if a parent were to pass away,\n\n301\n00:19:06.232 --> 00:19:10.615\nor parents pass away, the children\nobtain whatever that parent had.\n\n302\n00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:12.591\nSo you can think of it this way, so\n\n303\n00:19:12.591 --> 00:19:17.394\nthose child objects are gonna be obtaining\nthe same permissions in that downward\n\n304\n00:19:17.394 --> 00:19:21.680\nhierarchical structure\nwithin our directories here.\n\n305\n00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.240\nSo what we need to do here is,\nwe need to get rid of the inheritance so\n\n306\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.720\nby selecting actually,\nlet me back out of here and select here.\n\n307\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.900\nAnd let's go to our Advanced tab.\n\n308\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.020\nOur Advanced tab is going to\nenable us some additional\n\n309\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.325\nfeatures that we don't have on\nthat normal interface there so.\n\n310\n00:19:43.325 --> 00:19:48.225\nHere, I have a little more control and\nI can see a little more information.\n\n311\n00:19:48.225 --> 00:19:51.575\nSo it's really broken down to my aces and\n\n312\n00:19:51.575 --> 00:19:54.395\nI actually have two entries here for\nthose users.\n\n313\n00:19:54.395 --> 00:19:57.425\nTwo different permission sets.\n\n314\n00:19:57.425 --> 00:20:00.035\nI have read and execute available,\n\n315\n00:20:00.035 --> 00:20:04.560\nas well as some special permissions\nconfigured for that users group.\n\n316\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.990\nI wanna remove those so I can,\nlet's see here if I can hold on my shift.\n\n317\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.420\nNow, I have to remove them\nindividually and just select Remove.\n\n318\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.750\n&gt;&gt; So before you do that, Cherokee.\n\n319\n00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.145\nTake a look at that fourth column\nwhere it says inherited from,\n\n320\n00:20:17.145 --> 00:20:19.435\nI think that that's actually\na good clue for everybody.\n\n321\n00:20:19.435 --> 00:20:21.581\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's a great A great option, too.\n\n322\n00:20:21.581 --> 00:20:25.823\nAnd even when we take a look a little bit\nmore at inheritance, you can notice how\n\n323\n00:20:25.823 --> 00:20:31.160\nthis, and Ronnie's talking about this\ncolumn right here, the inherited from.\n\n324\n00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.570\nThis is where those\npermissions are originating.\n\n325\n00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.820\nSo, if there were several\nnested objects downward.\n\n326\n00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.680\nYou still have he original object where\nthere's permissions were sets, so\n\n327\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.470\nthat's where their specifying here so\n\n328\n00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.875\nwe can see that those permissions\nare coming from our C drive.\n\n329\n00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:53.860\nYou can go in and remove those permissions\noff the C drive and that's great, but\n\n330\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.060\nwhat if all of the other\nfolders under your C drive,\n\n331\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.276\nwhen you remove those\npermissions off the C drive.\n\n332\n00:21:00.276 --> 00:21:03.565\nAll those other folders\nare gonna be exposed as well.\n\n333\n00:21:03.565 --> 00:21:05.385\nSo is that something you really wanna do,\nor\n\n334\n00:21:05.385 --> 00:21:09.000\ndo we really just want to disable\ninheritance at this level?\n\n335\n00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.160\nSo we do have that option to go ahead and\nblock that inheritance here, so.\n\n336\n00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.190\n&gt;&gt; Now before we do that Cherokee, take\na look at that little check mark right\n\n337\n00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.311\nunderneath that box that you\nare about to click on there.\n\n338\n00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:25.791\nWhere it talks about replacing all\nobject permission [LAUGH] entries with\n\n339\n00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:28.890\nthe inheritable permissions right there.\n\n340\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.410\nNow, this is actually something\nthat you want to pay attention to,\n\n341\n00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.730\ndepending on where this object actually\nis and what ends up happening here.\n\n342\n00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:42.010\nBecause if you remove this and you have\na user that really needs to access this,\n\n343\n00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.300\nand you just do the disable inheritance.\n\n344\n00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:49.740\nYou're literally removing that group and\nthat inheritance part where\n\n345\n00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.930\nthat person that's not gonna be attached\nto that host group or whatever it is.\n\n346\n00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.558\nWell, they won't get any access at all.\n\n347\n00:21:55.558 --> 00:21:57.459\nSo, you wanna be careful before\nyou go ahead and just go,\n\n348\n00:21:57.459 --> 00:21:59.135\nlet me just disable the inheritance and\ngo [LAUGH].\n\n349\n00:21:59.135 --> 00:22:01.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah.\n\n350\n00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.340\nAnd that's the thing is because you have\nto think about any sub folders that may be\n\n351\n00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.470\nincluded in that particular folder\nthat you're modifying here.\n\n352\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:14.140\nSo That's definitely something to think\nabout when modifying these permissions.\n\n353\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.470\nSo for us because we know we are not\ndependent on these users group and\n\n354\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.725\nwe have created our own groups\nwithin Active Directory.\n\n355\n00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:25.075\nWe're gonna go ahead and\njump off the edge here.\n\n356\n00:22:25.075 --> 00:22:26.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we'll hit Remove.\n\n357\n00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.410\nAnd it's saying that,\n\n358\n00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.730\nI can't remove this because the object is\ninheriting permissions from it's parent.\n\n359\n00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you'll have to disable\ninheritance first. &gt;&gt; So, yeah.\n\n360\n00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.495\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n361\n00:22:37.495 --> 00:22:41.470\nNow, this is kind of interesting, I have\ntwo options here and let's take a look at\n\n362\n00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.110\nthose because that's kind of what\nRonnie was referencing right there.\n\n363\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.620\nIt kinds of reminds you, it says,\nhey, you have the ability to convert\n\n364\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:52.820\nthose inherited permissions into\nexplicit permissions on this object.\n\n365\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.830\nWhat does that mean?\n\n366\n00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:59.190\nWell, those explicit permissions\nequate to those block check boxes,\n\n367\n00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.370\nmeaning I have the ability to modify them.\n\n368\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.730\nWith those inherited, I can't modify them.\n\n369\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.450\nThose gray check boxes,\nI can't change those.\n\n370\n00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.980\nSo those are inherited versus\nexplicit are going to be\n\n371\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.320\nassigned to that object directly.\n\n372\n00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.550\nThey're block checks,\nand I can modify them.\n\n373\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.930\nAnd this is what Ronnie\nwas saying right here.\n\n374\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.520\nHey, do you wanna remove all inherited\npermissions from this object?\n\n375\n00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.220\nSo that's something that you\nshould think about because\n\n376\n00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.580\nyou may end up losing some\nof that access capability.\n\n377\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.330\nEither way here, because we plan on\ndeleting them, it's not a big deal.\n\n378\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:40.191\nBut my best practice would be to\nconvert the inherited permissions and\n\n379\n00:23:40.191 --> 00:23:43.181\nthen you have the option to choose.\n\n380\n00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:48.660\nSo like I said, you're not just\njumping off the edge there.\n\n381\n00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.280\nYou do have a little bit more control\nwhenever you select this first option.\n\n382\n00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.220\nAnd I'll show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n383\n00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.590\nSo if we do select that then\nthe permissions still exists and\n\n384\n00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.170\nI have the ability to go back in and\nconfigure them if I chose to do so.\n\n385\n00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.000\nAnd then for\nthe special permission, same thing.\n\n386\n00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.770\nOkay, we can see that this information\nhas already been blocked by inheritance.\n\n387\n00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.790\nSo I'm gonna hit Apply.\n\n388\n00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.944\n&gt;&gt; And now look at that\nfourth column again, right?\n\n389\n00:24:16.944 --> 00:24:19.060\nIt's no longer listed to see, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Where is it inherited from?\n\n390\n00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.920\nExactly.\n\n391\n00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.890\nSo it doesn't have that inheritance here.\n\n392\n00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:24.653\nWe'll hit OK.\n\n393\n00:24:24.653 --> 00:24:28.650\nAnd now because we selected\nthat first option there.\n\n394\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:34.060\nAnd these are explicit, if I go into Edit,\nI do have the ability to actually change\n\n395\n00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.840\nand remove these at this particular, if I\nclick on the right group, that'll help.\n\n396\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.000\nBut now you can see,\n\n397\n00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.780\nlook I can deselect these objects whereas\nbefore I didn't have that option.\n\n398\n00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.146\nAnd if I were to select Apply.\n\n399\n00:24:47.146 --> 00:24:49.815\nAnd now because those\npermissions have been removed,\n\n400\n00:24:49.815 --> 00:24:52.900\nI'm able to actually remove\nthat access control entry.\n\n401\n00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:58.220\nSo it's a lot of work to go ahead and\nremove that but once you get\n\n402\n00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.920\nyour groups setup within Active Directory\nand have a good solid understanding.\n\n403\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.690\nIn most companies, they usually use\ndepartments or geographical locations but\n\n404\n00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.940\nthat's up to you on how\nyou wanna configure that.\n\n405\n00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.100\nNow, I should be able to go ahead and\n\n406\n00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:17.460\nremove these users and\nthere you have it, it's gone.\n\n407\n00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.850\nSo at this point in time,\n\n408\n00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.980\nwe really need to focus on how we're\nmanaging our host and manger's group.\n\n409\n00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.680\nAnd I'll show you when we come back,\n\n410\n00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.870\nI know we're getting close on time,\nlogging in and out with different users.\n\n411\n00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.890\nAnd how these permissions\nthat we just set are gonna be\n\n412\n00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.429\naffecting our individual users.\n\n413\n00:25:34.942 --> 00:25:38.380\nAll right Cherokee, well thank you again\nfor helping us to understand a little bit\n\n414\n00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.580\nabout the configuration\nof NTFS permissions.\n\n415\n00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.830\nThere is a lot more for us to see, but\nat least we got the beginnings here.\n\n416\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.310\nWe understand that those permissions\nare set either at the file or\n\n417\n00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.370\nthe folder level, but\nwhen you do have users and\n\n418\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:55.240\ngroups that are combined, you need to\nbe careful in the way that they're set.\n\n419\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.820\nSo, here Cherokee is\ngetting that setup for us.\n\n420\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.760\nAnd we are looking forward to\nseeing another part of the NTFS\n\n421\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.290\nconfiguration as well.\n\n422\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.990\nWell, this is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n423\n00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.520\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n424\n00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.540\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n425\n00:26:10.540 -->

00:00:08.498\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.498 --> 00:00:12.610\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.195\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:20.130\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.680\nAnd we're specifically\naddressing exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.560\nRight in the middle of a little mini\nseries on configuring NTFS permissions and\n\n9\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.990\nhere to continue with us is gonna be Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.390\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.919\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for\nhaving me in this mini series here Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.919 --> 00:00:38.753\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right Cherokee, so\nas we took a look at it last time,\n\n13\n00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:41.880\nwe did address kind of\nsome of the major issues.\n\n14\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.480\nBut we were in the middle of\nconfiguring a few things, as well.\n\n15\n00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.840\nSo Cherokee, take us through what we\nkind of basically talked about but\n\n16\n00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.330\nwhat we're gonna be picking up on now.\n\n17\n00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.627\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie, so let's just recap\nbecause we did cover quite a bit.\n\n18\n00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:57.520\nAnd I know there's a lot to think about\nwhen we're talking about permissions.\n\n19\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.870\nSo if we could take a look at my screen.\n\n20\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.620\nI'll show you a very simple way\nthat we can just review information\n\n21\n00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.270\nassociated with a particular object.\n\n22\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870\nSo if you Right Click &gt; Properties,\n\n23\n00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.700\nthis will bring up the ability\nto access our Security tab.\n\n24\n00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.880\nFrom here, I can select Advanced, and\nthis is where I'll be able to identify\n\n25\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.540\nthe effective access on a per user,\nper group or per device basis.\n\n26\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.200\nSo let's see here for effective access,\nwe'll go ahead and click on this tab.\n\n27\n00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.510\nThis is where you see that per user or\ngroup option and\n\n28\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.230\nthis is that device option there, so\n\n29\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.860\nwhat we wanna check is Ronnie's status\nwith his effective permissions.\n\n30\n00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.507\nSo what the operating system does is\nidentify what groups Ronnie as a part of,\n\n31\n00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:52.439\nand they don't really tell me which groups\nRonnie as a part of in this screen here,\n\n32\n00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.314\nyou would need to look in\nActive Directory users and computers.\n\n33\n00:01:56.314 --> 00:01:58.650\nBut that's really not what\nwe're trying to check here.\n\n34\n00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.340\nWe're really trying to check what\npermissions does Ronnie have.\n\n35\n00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.811\nAnd because remember, they are cumulative,\nthe operating system is going to take\n\n36\n00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:12.297\nthat information that higher precedence\nand then deliver that information to us.\n\n37\n00:02:12.297 --> 00:02:18.578\nSo let's select a user and\nhere I'll put in Ronnie's login name.\n\n38\n00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:22.103\nWe'll select check names and\nI just have to authenticate.\n\n39\n00:02:28.302 --> 00:02:29.842\nI can remember my password.\n\n40\n00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:33.000\nAll right, so here we have Ronnie,\nright there as our domain member and\n\n41\n00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.215\nwe'll just select OK.\n\n42\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.930\nAnd now because we can Ronnie\nhas been selected here,\n\n43\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.970\nwe're going to select view\neffective access and scroll down.\n\n44\n00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.380\nLet me just full screen this and.\n\n45\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.330\nSo, Ronnie has got quite\na bit of permissions here.\n\n46\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.980\nWe can look at those really granular\ncomponents that we have here.\n\n47\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.430\nAnd see what Ronnie does have access to,\nthese green check marks.\n\n48\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.030\nAnd if you look really closely, you can,\ngosh, maybe if you can see that.\n\n49\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.170\nYou can see that these permissions,\nthey have the little symbol for\n\n50\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.320\nthe group next to them, so\nthat's implying where these permissions\n\n51\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.880\nare coming from for\nRonnie's account there.\n\n52\n00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.200\nHowever, we have some permissions that\nare not allowed as far as deleting and\n\n53\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.020\ntaking ownership which is another\nthing that I would like to point out.\n\n54\n00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.920\nIf I were to assign Ronnie full control,\nhe would have\n\n55\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.920\nthe ability to take ownership and\ndelete those sub folders and files.\n\n56\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.150\nCurrently, the owner of this show ideas\nfolder, we can see is the administrator.\n\n57\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.690\nHere, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.890\nFor the local machine, SVR 02,\nthat's my server here.\n\n59\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.380\nIf Ronnie had the ability, the full\ncontrol permission, he could change it and\n\n60\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.960\nmake himself, in fact,\nthe owner if he choose to do so.\n\n61\n00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.220\nSo that's also another perk of\nhaving that full control permission.\n\n62\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.650\nSo if we wanted to check someone else out,\nlet's see, we'll just hit Cancel here.\n\n63\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.760\nOops, I probably should have\njust not backed out completely.\n\n64\n00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.170\nBut we can check another user like Zach.\n\n65\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.130\nSo we'll just put his information\nin here and select check names.\n\n66\n00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.050\nAnd hit OK and\nview Zach's effective permissions.\n\n67\n00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.970\nScroll down and\nagain we'll full screen that.\n\n68\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.020\nAnd notice how Zack has\nsignificantly less permissions here.\n\n69\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.960\nWe have that he's able to create files and\nwrite, as well as creating folders and\n\n70\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.650\nappend it with data,\nas well as writing attributes, and\n\n71\n00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.360\nwriting extended attributes.\n\n72\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.610\nSo we see, Zack is more limited and that's\nwhat we wanna verify here with our test.\n\n73\n00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.720\nBut I do wanna show you\nanother tab that we have here.\n\n74\n00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.000\nAnd this is called the Auditing tab.\n\n75\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.590\nBecause we haven't really\naccessed this folder as of yet,\n\n76\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.790\nthere's nothing in this Auditing tab.\n\n77\n00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.640\nThis is going to be our log and it\nshould contain information about who was\n\n78\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.630\nable to access that, and\nwhat time have that user's name.\n\n79\n00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.410\nSo this is something that we could use for\nwell, auditing purposes just to make sure\n\n80\n00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.530\nthat the right individuals are actually\naccessing this information.\n\n81\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.460\nSo who knows?\n\n82\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.793\nWe might come back and\ntake a look at this just to verify once\n\n83\n00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:25.689\nwe've logged in as Ronnie and Zach,\nso let's go ahead and do that.\n\n84\n00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.900\nI'll close out of here and\njust back out and go ahead and log off.\n\n85\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.350\nSo first,\nI would like to log on as Zack and\n\n86\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.100\nif I can get logged in here.\n\n87\n00:05:41.368 --> 00:05:44.080\nAll right, [LAUGH] so\nlet's go ahead and log in as Zack and\n\n88\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.010\nsee if we can perform\nthe functions that we need to.\n\n89\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.700\nSo I need to make sure I'm\nlogging on as our ITPro demo\n\n90\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.190\ndomain backslash, and\nhis login is Z-M-E-M-O-S.\n\n91\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.750\nAnd then we'll put in his super\nsecret password and log in.\n\n92\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.700\nNow, the first thing we wanna do\nis actually create a document.\n\n93\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.399\nSo let's just create\na simple text file here and\n\n94\n00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:14.817\nsay, hey these are my show ideas.\n\n95\n00:06:14.817 --> 00:06:16.710\nDid I go too fast, is that what happened?\n\n96\n00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.810\nLet me slow down.\n\n97\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.480\nNew, all right, Text Document.\n\n98\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.030\nSo we'll name this Zack,\nand we'll say ideas.\n\n99\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.630\nAnd we'll go in there and\nsay these are my ideas, ta da.\n\n100\n00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.665\nOkay, so this is Zack's document here, and\n\n101\n00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:43.723\nwe'll just save that to make sure,\nall right.\n\n102\n00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:52.497\nNow, when we take a look at\nthe permissions that we've assigned\n\n103\n00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:57.440\nto Zack and we see our Show ideas\nfolder and we try to click on it.\n\n104\n00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.278\nWe get this notification here that says,\n\n105\n00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:02.760\nyou don't currently have\npermissions to access this folder.\n\n106\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.190\nAnd if you can recall, one of the options\nwas to be able to list the contents.\n\n107\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.310\nOne of the permissions was to be able to\nview the contents inside of this folder,\n\n108\n00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.540\nand we didn't assign that to Zack or\nto our host group.\n\n109\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.960\nWe're not just calling him\nout individually here.\n\n110\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.000\nBut we wanted to be able to write\nto this folder and nothing else.\n\n111\n00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.160\nSo that's pretty\nrestrictive in that aspect.\n\n112\n00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.750\nSo we'll hit Cancel, and see if Zack can\nplace his Show ideas within this folder.\n\n113\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.760\nWe are able to drag and drop and\nit appears that Zack was able to put his\n\n114\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.330\ninformation in there but we can't really\ntell for sure until we log in as Ronnie\n\n115\n00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.350\nbecause we gave Ronnie those permissions\nto manage those individual documents.\n\n116\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:51.529\nSo let's go ahead and log off,\nand then log in as Ronnie.\n\n117\n00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:56.335\n&gt;&gt; So we know that from taking a look\nat what Cherokee just showed us, right.\n\n118\n00:07:56.335 --> 00:07:59.409\nIs this ability to have Zack be\nable to write to that folder, but\n\n119\n00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:01.845\nwithout actually being\nable to look inside that.\n\n120\n00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:05.783\nThat provides a basic security, so\nthat Zack can drop off his ideas but\n\n121\n00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:09.990\ninstead of opening that folder up and\ngetting access to other files that may\n\n122\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.440\nbe in there that we don't\nwant Zach to get access to.\n\n123\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.860\nHe's not able to even look inside that\nfolder without advanced permissions or\n\n124\n00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.060\nsomebody giving him permissions to do so.\n\n125\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Ronnie, so\nwhat we should be able to do\n\n126\n00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.870\nnow is check to verify that you\nare able to manage those show ideas.\n\n127\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.220\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n128\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.230\nIf I double click on this folder,\n\n129\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.260\nI'm really hoping that Ronnie does\nnot receive an error message here.\n\n130\n00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.500\nSo we'll double click and\n\n131\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.220\nthere we go we've seen that a couple of\nhosts have submitted some show ideas.\n\n132\n00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.450\nWe've got Cherokee's ideas and\nZack ideas in there.\n\n133\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.137\nAnd that's just one way where we can set\npermissions to really restrict access\n\n134\n00:08:47.137 --> 00:08:48.780\nwithin our environments.\n\n135\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.585\nBut that's not all folks,\n\n136\n00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:54.676\nwe have other ways that we can\nimplement permissions as well.\n\n137\n00:08:54.676 --> 00:08:58.934\nBut I think we'll have to come back\nbecause there are a lot of different ways\n\n138\n00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:03.652\nto configure shared permissions that would\nbe a great place to go ahead and start.\n\n139\n00:09:03.652 --> 00:09:07.000\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, well thank you for\nhelping us to understand and\n\n140\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.940\nsee the demonstration there.\n\n141\n00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.520\nWhere we could take those permissions and\nshow the granularity to them.\n\n142\n00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.890\nRestricting access to one user while\nactually allowing another user get access\n\n143\n00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.740\nto that same folder as well.\n\n144\n00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.630\nThere are a lot of different examples\nof this that you will also be able to\n\n145\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.470\nmake sure that Josh encounter everyday\nin a real productive environment.\n\n146\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.740\nNow if this is your first time configuring\nsomething like this complexity\n\n147\n00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.720\nthat we're talking about, don't think that\nit's gonna be done perfectly every time.\n\n148\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.720\nYou may end up finding out where\nyou create something like this\n\n149\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.482\nwhere you change those permissions and\nyou don't get access to those files.\n\n150\n00:09:41.482 --> 00:09:43.487\nAnd so\nyou have to kinda back track a little bit,\n\n151\n00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:46.450\nthen you have to figure out\nwhere all those permissions are.\n\n152\n00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.577\nSo take some time, make sure you do\nlearn and get those NTFS permissions\n\n153\n00:09:51.577 --> 00:09:56.883\npacked before you go in and sit for\nany particular Microsoft exam as well.\n\n154\n00:09:56.883 --> 00:09:59.050\nAll right, Cherokee,\nany last words for our viewers?\n\n155\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie,\nI think you had a pretty good point there.\n\n156\n00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.568\nJust really getting in hands on and\nchecking especially after you have set\n\n157\n00:10:04.568 --> 00:10:08.170\npermissions, you might wanna go back and\ndouble check them.\n\n158\n00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.820\nWe will also be having an entire\nsection on just group policy.\n\n159\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:20.050\nSo in larger environments, group policy is\na more popular option, a way to go there.\n\n160\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.468\nSo we'll also be taking a look at that.\n\n161\n00:10:22.468 --> 00:10:28.285\nBut understanding NTFS permissions and\nhow they apply and propagate downward and\n\n162\n00:10:28.285 --> 00:10:32.365\nthe different accounts that are generated\nby the system like the every one group.\n\n163\n00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:38.477\nJust looking at those and understanding\nthat's probably a good place to start.\n\n164\n00:10:38.477 --> 00:10:40.977\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, thank you again but\nthat's a great place for\n\n165\n00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:42.597\nus to end this episode.\n\n166\n00:10:42.597 --> 00:10:45.417\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n167\n00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:46.467\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n168\n00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:50.389\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n169\n00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:51.346\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.915\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:15.350\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.008\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012,\n\n6\n00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.912\nit's specifically for exam 70-410.\n\n7\n00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:27.110\nToday, we're gonna be taking a look at\nconfiguring, well, Share Permissions.\n\n8\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.646\nAnd here to help us understand this\nconcept better is gonna be Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:30.280\nCherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.190\nCherokee, welcome back to the show,\nhow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie,\nI'm doing great today, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.488\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n13\n00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:40.510\nNow, Cherokee, we've already talked\nabout the idea of the NTFS permissions,\n\n14\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.770\nwe've gone through that,\nand talked about that.\n\n15\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.210\nNow we're adding in another level of,\nwell, permissions it sounds like.\n\n16\n00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.960\nSo, Cherokee, help us out here,\nwhen do we tend to deal with this.\n\n17\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.500\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, we're definitely not at a\nlack of ways we can implement permissions.\n\n18\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.355\nYes, we have spoke about NTFS permissions.\n\n19\n00:00:58.355 --> 00:00:59.775\nAnd you know what, as a matter of fact,\n\n20\n00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:03.935\nI wanted to mention one thing about that,\nwe are gonna be taking a look\n\n21\n00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:07.285\nat group policy a little bit later\nbecause there is an order of precedence.\n\n22\n00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:10.625\nWhen you look at all these different\ntypes of permissions that we have,\n\n23\n00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:15.645\nyou really need to understand also,\nwhich permissions will override.\n\n24\n00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:18.380\nSo we'll look at that when\nwe talk about group policy.\n\n25\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.650\nBut one thing I specifically wanted to\ncall out for exam test takers out there.\n\n26\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.950\nIn the real life it doesn't matter so\nmuch with the verbiage, but\n\n27\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.670\nprior to Server 2012, and 2012 R2,\n\n28\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.690\nthere was some terminology that I\nthink I used in the last show that on\n\n29\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.156\nthe exam it's just important to know that\nthey might be called something different.\n\n30\n00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:45.460\nSo, when we looked at\nour basic permissions.\n\n31\n00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.179\nAnd those were the six\npermission styles that Microsoft\n\n32\n00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.160\nordered or they put together for us.\n\n33\n00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.110\nAnd a read or execute, the list\nfolder contents, things like that.\n\n34\n00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.450\nSo that used to be called standard.\n\n35\n00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.126\nAnd so, 2012 and 2012 R2 and\nmoving forward, those are called basic.\n\n36\n00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.641\nAnd then those special\npermissions that we spoke about,\n\n37\n00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:14.380\nthose were gonna be the really fine tuned,\ngranular type permissions.\n\n38\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.450\nThose used to be called special and\n\n39\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.960\nI think they're still even listed\nin the operation system as special.\n\n40\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.190\nBut if you see it on the exam,\nthe term advanced permissions,\n\n41\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.650\nthat's all that they're referencing there.\n\n42\n00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.010\nSo just FYI.\n\n43\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.570\nBut, the type of permissions that\nwe're going to be talking about today\n\n44\n00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.080\nare called share permissions.\n\n45\n00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.780\nSo share permissions are interesting\nbecause if I were to share\n\n46\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.960\na resource such as a folder or\na volume, then I am\n\n47\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.170\nable to set permissions for\nthat particular object that I've shared.\n\n48\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.628\nThe thing with share permissions\nis that they're only effective if\n\n49\n00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:57.820\nthe individual or\n\n50\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.010\nthe security principle is accessing\nthat resource across the wire.\n\n51\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.050\nWhat does that mean?\n\n52\n00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.470\nWell, that means if I were to,\nmaybe Ronnie had shared something out,\n\n53\n00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.830\na folder out to me on his computer and\nmaybe he set certain share\n\n54\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.560\npermissions that restricted some sort\nof access in a particular way for me.\n\n55\n00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.230\nBut if he had not restricted\n\n56\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.370\nto match the access via NTFS permissions,\nthe ones we just spoke about.\n\n57\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.730\nThen, theoretically, I could go log on to\nRonnie's computer, if I was able to, and\n\n58\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.910\naccess that same resource but\nwithout those share permissions.\n\n59\n00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.960\nSo that is something that\nyou have to think about.\n\n60\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.510\nThese share permissions\nare only going to be applied\n\n61\n00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.630\nwhen accessing that\nresource over the network.\n\n62\n00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.470\nAnd then you're thinking, well,\n\n63\n00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.070\nif I just applied those NTFS permissions,\nwhy do I even need share permission?\n\n64\n00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.020\nSo I can't give you that answer.\n\n65\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.400\nThat's gonna be up to Microsoft.\n\n66\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.830\nBut just know that they do exist and\n\n67\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.660\nwe did say that NTFS\npermissions were cumulative.\n\n68\n00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.270\nMeaning, they built upon each other\nif I were a part of multiple groups.\n\n69\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.350\nHowever, when you take\nNTFS permissions and\n\n70\n00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.450\nshare permissions and really compare\nthose two and put them together,\n\n71\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.750\nit's always going to be the most\nrestricted is going to override here.\n\n72\n00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.574\nSo there is a little bit of difference\nin the way that they do apply.\n\n73\n00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:28.265\nAnd if you do not have any NTFS\npermissions configured on a resource but\n\n74\n00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:32.907\nyou have shared it out,\nthen access will not be granted.\n\n75\n00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:37.220\nSo just because you set share permissions,\nyou can't assume, I don't need to worry\n\n76\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.941\nabout NTFS, because they still need to\nbe in existence and be present there.\n\n77\n00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:43.249\nSo that's just something to think about,\nand\n\n78\n00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.048\nI'm sure there will be a lot more as we\ncontinue to look throughout the show.\n\n79\n00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:51.779\nBecause Microsoft has an abundant\nmethods of how I may be able\n\n80\n00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:55.030\nto share a resource to someone.\n\n81\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.980\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, the other thing I\nunderstand about share positions, and\n\n82\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.070\ncorrect me if I'm wrong here on this,\nis that with NTFS permissions,\n\n83\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.300\nI can apply those to folders like\nwe did in previous episodes.\n\n84\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.400\nOr I can even go down and\n\n85\n00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.472\napply them to individual objects within\nfolders like files if I choose to.\n\n86\n00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:13.090\nSo NTFS file and\nfolder permissions do allow me to do that.\n\n87\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.230\nBut I don't think,\nif I remember correctly,\n\n88\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.380\nCherokee, that I can apply share\npermissions to files, right?\n\n89\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.100\n&gt;&gt; No, so when we're really\ntalking about share permissions,\n\n90\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.580\nthat's going to be either a folder or\na volume.\n\n91\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.790\nIf I wanted to share an entire\nvolume I could as well.\n\n92\n00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.780\nSo if you wanted to share out,\nRonnie, just a file,\n\n93\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.930\nthen you could put a file in a folder, but\nthen you need to share that folder out.\n\n94\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.900\nSo that's just kind of a work around for\nthat, so.\n\n95\n00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.350\nThat's actually a good segue into\nsomething like, what if we just have\n\n96\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.720\nan end user that wants to share something,\na very basic share?\n\n97\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.720\nMaybe you did just want one file\nthat you wanted to share with me,\n\n98\n00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.700\nso how would you go about doing that?\n\n99\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.220\nWell, if we take a look at my computer and\nwe'll set up a couple of folders, and\n\n100\n00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.580\nlet's pull up our C drive, I'm just\non the server here and let's do that.\n\n101\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.790\nLet's create a new folder\nto place your object in.\n\n102\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.740\nSo we'll say New Folder and\nwe'll say Ronnie's folder.\n\n103\n00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.705\nAnd inside Ronnie's folder,\nlet's create a text document here.\n\n104\n00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:16.160\nAnd we'll just say test text.\n\n105\n00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.071\nAll right, now let me back up out of here.\n\n106\n00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:25.097\nAnd when I'm just hovering\nover Ronnie's folder,\n\n107\n00:06:25.097 --> 00:06:29.500\nI could simply right-click and\nthen select Share with.\n\n108\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.640\nAnd I don't know if you can see that one,\nlet me zoom in a bit.\n\n109\n00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.210\nAnd then select Specific people.\n\n110\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.630\nSo I actually don't have myself\nin Active Directory here,\n\n111\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.280\nI had put you in Active Directory for\nthis example.\n\n112\n00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.200\nSo it would be a little silly to share\nwith yourself because of the name of our\n\n113\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.770\nfolder, but let's I had created folder and\nit was Cherokee's folder.\n\n114\n00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.110\nAnd I wanted to share it with Ronnie.\n\n115\n00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.590\nI know Ronnie is in Active Directory here.\n\n116\n00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.250\nSo let me just start typing his name in.\n\n117\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.910\nAnd let me zoom out a little bit so\n\n118\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.950\nyou can see what this\nactual window looks like.\n\n119\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.930\nSo I just right clicked on it and\nselected share with.\n\n120\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.160\nNow I don't have to just choose one user,\n\n121\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.390\nI can also share it with a group\nif I had one configured as well.\n\n122\n00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.680\nBut let's just start typing in Ronnie and\nhit Add.\n\n123\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.460\nUnable to find Ronnie.\n\n124\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.540\nLet's see if it'll find\nyou by your Aactual name.\n\n125\n00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.750\nOkay, so here we have his account and\nwe'll select OK.\n\n126\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.170\nAnd it's actually pretty simple,\nthat's all you have to do.\n\n127\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.600\nThe options for permissions here\n\n128\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.590\nare somewhat limited with this very\nrudimentary type of sharing process.\n\n129\n00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.560\nI have the ability to select read,\nread and write, or\n\n130\n00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.050\njust remove him completely here.\n\n131\n00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.934\nNow, when I select share,\nthis is what we have.\n\n132\n00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:57.135\nI can either email someone\nthe links to be shared items, or\n\n133\n00:07:57.135 --> 00:07:59.378\nI can copy and paste this link.\n\n134\n00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:04.156\nSo this is gonna be my\nParticular UNC path.\n\n135\n00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:08.691\nAnd this is very easy, I don't need\nto really explain this to anyone.\n\n136\n00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:11.980\nPeople know how to copy and\npaste, so it works for end users.\n\n137\n00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.855\nThat's great.\n\n138\n00:08:12.855 --> 00:08:17.815\nBut there may be lacking some\ndesired configurations with this\n\n139\n00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:22.410\nvery basic share type here,\nso let's just hit Done here.\n\n140\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.240\nSo that was Ronnie's folder.\n\n141\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.532\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate a second folder and\n\n142\n00:08:27.532 --> 00:08:32.110\nlook at a second method to be\nable to share this resource out.\n\n143\n00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.106\nSo let's just name this folder second.\n\n144\n00:08:35.106 --> 00:08:36.657\nI'm being super creative today.\n\n145\n00:08:36.657 --> 00:08:40.099\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And right-click on this Resource, and\n\n146\n00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:41.879\nthen select Properties.\n\n147\n00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.854\nSo, if we go to the second tab here,\nthis is going to be our sharing tab.\n\n148\n00:08:47.854 --> 00:08:52.171\nOn our sharing tab,\nif we notice this first option right here,\n\n149\n00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:53.885\nthis Share button, hm.\n\n150\n00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:55.690\nThis looks a little familiar, right?\n\n151\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.612\nThis looks just like that window\nthat we launched a few moments ago.\n\n152\n00:08:59.612 --> 00:09:01.292\nSo this isn't gonna help me.\n\n153\n00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:04.690\nThis isn't going to allow me any\nkind of additional configurations.\n\n154\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.697\nLet's hit Cancel.\n\n155\n00:09:06.697 --> 00:09:11.820\nIf I select Advanced Sharing,\nI do see some more options here.\n\n156\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.344\nSo, I first have to select, tick this\nbox right here to share this folder,\n\n157\n00:09:18.344 --> 00:09:23.523\nand then the folder,\nthat name that we had selected is going\n\n158\n00:09:23.523 --> 00:09:28.305\nto be second by default,\nunless I decide to change it.\n\n159\n00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:30.969\nSo maybe I wanna change\nit to the number two,\n\n160\n00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:35.860\nbecause this is folder number two\nthat we've created or whatever.\n\n161\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.253\nYou may want to change the name of this\nfolder, well, let me rephrase that.\n\n162\n00:09:39.253 --> 00:09:41.485\nYou're not actually changing\nthe name of the folder,\n\n163\n00:09:41.485 --> 00:09:43.650\nyou're just changing\nthe name of the share.\n\n164\n00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:48.134\nSo on your side or the back end\nside the folder name is the same.\n\n165\n00:09:48.134 --> 00:09:52.350\nSo if it's a really long name or something\nthat may not be easy for your end users or\n\n166\n00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.388\nclients to understand,\nthen you might want to go ahead and\n\n167\n00:09:55.388 --> 00:09:57.935\ncreate something different here for\nthat name.\n\n168\n00:09:57.935 --> 00:10:01.422\nSo that's an extra option\nthat we didn't have before.\n\n169\n00:10:01.422 --> 00:10:05.634\nAnd if you look at this\nportion right here,\n\n170\n00:10:05.634 --> 00:10:13.019\nit says limit the number of\nsimultaneous users to 16,777,216.\n\n171\n00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.090\nSo that's quite a bit.\n\n172\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.963\nAnd if you only had 20 users in your\nenvironment, you might wanna go\n\n173\n00:10:19.963 --> 00:10:25.019\nahead in and limit that,\nperhaps down to not 0.20, but just 20.\n\n174\n00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:29.696\nYou might wanna change that to prevent\nany kind of unauthorized access or\n\n175\n00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:34.617\neven potentially some kind of distributed\ndenial of service attack there.\n\n176\n00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:38.106\nBut, it really is just up to\nyou how you wanna do that.\n\n177\n00:10:38.106 --> 00:10:42.212\n&gt;&gt; And that's actually about limiting\nthe number of simultaneous people that can\n\n178\n00:10:42.212 --> 00:10:43.322\nconnect at one time.\n\n179\n00:10:43.322 --> 00:10:45.962\nSo, in previous editions,\nif I remember, and\n\n180\n00:10:45.962 --> 00:10:48.670\nagain this is going back a long time ago.\n\n181\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.002\nIt used to be limited to ten,\n\n182\n00:10:50.002 --> 00:10:53.229\nwhere only ten people could connect\nat one particular point in time.\n\n183\n00:10:53.229 --> 00:10:55.797\nBut at some point Microsoft decided-\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's crazy [LAUGH].\n\n184\n00:10:55.797 --> 00:11:00.664\n&gt;&gt; Decided to go to 2 to the 24th power\ninstead of number of connections that\n\n185\n00:11:00.664 --> 00:11:01.604\nyou can have.\n\n186\n00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:04.286\nAnd that's because the idea of shares,\nright?\n\n187\n00:11:04.286 --> 00:11:06.695\nThat's it usually is a network wide and\n\n188\n00:11:06.695 --> 00:11:11.374\ninstead of putting some artificial\nlimitation that they used to they gets.\n\n189\n00:11:11.374 --> 00:11:14.068\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n190\n00:11:14.068 --> 00:11:18.604\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so anyways, you do have that\noption and it's funny, they really,\n\n191\n00:11:18.604 --> 00:11:23.374\nthey gave you a lot of options too with\nyour share so it's kind of interesting.\n\n192\n00:11:23.374 --> 00:11:25.534\nA couple other options you have here,\n\n193\n00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:30.450\nadditional comments if you choose to do\nso, good for production environments.\n\n194\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.485\nYou also have the option to take those\npermissions to the next level here.\n\n195\n00:11:35.485 --> 00:11:38.212\nSo instead of just those two that we saw,\n\n196\n00:11:38.212 --> 00:11:44.360\nthose two options from the prior method,\nwe have a little bit more control here.\n\n197\n00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.829\nSo, by default you'll notice that\nthere's currently a group called\n\n198\n00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:48.896\nthe Everyone group.\n\n199\n00:11:48.896 --> 00:11:52.450\nSo this is something that\nthe operating system created.\n\n200\n00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.344\nThis is an operating system created group.\n\n201\n00:11:55.344 --> 00:11:57.173\nIt's not something that I've created.\n\n202\n00:11:57.173 --> 00:12:02.189\nAnd it's something to be aware of,\nbecause by default here I have those read,\n\n203\n00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:05.153\nbut if you think about\nthe logic behind it, and\n\n204\n00:12:05.153 --> 00:12:09.638\nwe have our most restrictive types\nof permissions over writing here.\n\n205\n00:12:09.638 --> 00:12:14.407\nYou'll also see in a lot of environments\nwhere people just give full control to\n\n206\n00:12:14.407 --> 00:12:15.790\nthat Everyone group.\n\n207\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.235\nAnd you're thinking that's crazy from a\nsecurity standpoint, why would I do that?\n\n208\n00:12:20.235 --> 00:12:24.600\nThat sounds stupid, why would I\never give everyone full control?\n\n209\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.968\nWell, Microsoft is betting on\nthe fact that you're really paying\n\n210\n00:12:28.968 --> 00:12:32.712\nattention to your NTFS\npermission configurations, and\n\n211\n00:12:32.712 --> 00:12:37.553\nthey are going to be more restrictive\nthan utilizing the Everyone group.\n\n212\n00:12:37.553 --> 00:12:41.770\nBecause when it comes down to it, and\nyou're talking about troubleshooting, and\n\n213\n00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.020\nyou really have varied permissions.\n\n214\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.975\nMicrosoft even recommends, look,\nstick with one of the other so\n\n215\n00:12:48.975 --> 00:12:52.398\ntheir ideology,\nlike I can even talk today,\n\n216\n00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:57.823\nlet's really configure those NTFS,\nallow those share permissions.\n\n217\n00:12:57.823 --> 00:13:00.211\nSo it just makes for\nsimplified troubleshooting there,\n\n218\n00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:01.112\nif that makes sense.\n\n219\n00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:05.573\nSo, you might wanna consider how\nmy share permissions are set to\n\n220\n00:13:05.573 --> 00:13:10.230\nreflect how my NTFS permissions\nshould be applied there.\n\n221\n00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.810\n&gt;&gt; We do wanna make sure that we consider\nthis idea of the Everyone group as well.\n\n222\n00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.430\nMost users that are just\ncoming to their MCSA,\n\n223\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.440\nthey may not understand\nwhat that encompasses.\n\n224\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.763\nWhen we talk about the idea of everyone,\nthat means everyone.\n\n225\n00:13:22.763 --> 00:13:25.619\nAnd this includes whether\nyou're an administrator or\n\n226\n00:13:25.619 --> 00:13:27.300\nwhether you're a domain user.\n\n227\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.399\nWhatever it is.\n\n228\n00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.999\n&gt;&gt; Local, domain joint.\n\n229\n00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:35.730\n&gt;&gt; It is every single person, every single\nobject that we have in this ability.\n\n230\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.152\nSo we're saying, yes,\nlet it have all full open access.\n\n231\n00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.674\nBut by default, right?\n\n232\n00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:43.610\nWhat Cherokee is saying\nis that it's set to read.\n\n233\n00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.273\nAnd that can play havoc when you also\nhave already, let's say that you,\n\n234\n00:13:47.273 --> 00:13:50.458\ninstead of creating a brand new\nfolder like what Cherokee did,\n\n235\n00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:52.705\nit could be that this\nis an existing folder.\n\n236\n00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:57.550\nAnd let's say that Cherokee actually said\nthat's right, these people need access to\n\n237\n00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.565\nthis but she's actually complicated\nthose NTFS permissions over time.\n\n238\n00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:02.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it happens.\n\n239\n00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.972\n&gt;&gt; Users get involved in one group, and\nthen they're added into another group, and\n\n240\n00:14:05.972 --> 00:14:08.090\nthen they get added into another group.\n\n241\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:11.112\nAnd now all of a sudden Cherokee\nsays I'm gonna share this out.\n\n242\n00:14:11.112 --> 00:14:14.840\nAnd all of a sudden she\nputs re-permissions on it.\n\n243\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.572\nWell now, guess what?\n\n244\n00:14:16.572 --> 00:14:19.998\nEverybody thought that they had\nfull control or partial read and\n\n245\n00:14:19.998 --> 00:14:21.907\nwrite acts, whatever it might be.\n\n246\n00:14:21.907 --> 00:14:23.216\nThey all end up with what?\n\n247\n00:14:23.216 --> 00:14:24.735\nThe idea of the most restrictive,\nwhich would be-\n\n248\n00:14:24.735 --> 00:14:25.664\n&gt;&gt; That's right, read.\n\n249\n00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:27.092\n&gt;&gt; Read permissions.\n&gt;&gt; In that situation, yeah.\n\n250\n00:14:27.092 --> 00:14:28.930\n&gt;&gt; And that would become complicated.\n\n251\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.022\nSo what Cherokee is recommending, which is\nnormally the way that I've set it up and\n\n252\n00:14:33.022 --> 00:14:35.944\nthe way that most people I know\nhave set it up, is to say hey,\n\n253\n00:14:35.944 --> 00:14:39.414\nlet's take the share permissions and\njust do every one full control.\n\n254\n00:14:39.414 --> 00:14:41.389\nAnd if I'm troubleshooting anything,\n\n255\n00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:45.055\nthen I only really have to worry about\ntroubleshooting NTFS permissions.\n\n256\n00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:48.324\nI don't have to worry about taking\ninto consideration whether it's more\n\n257\n00:14:48.324 --> 00:14:49.913\nrestrictive or less restrictive.\n\n258\n00:14:49.913 --> 00:14:51.565\nWhich one is actually the most?\n\n259\n00:14:51.565 --> 00:14:54.901\nI know it's gonna always be more\nrestrictive which is going to be under\n\n260\n00:14:54.901 --> 00:14:57.930\nNTFS, so\nI'm only trouble shooting in one place.\n\n261\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.263\nSo this is kind of the way\nthat we set this up.\n\n262\n00:15:00.263 --> 00:15:05.510\nIt used to be in previous editions of\nthe MCSA, we used to call this the classic\n\n263\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.829\nyou know [INAUDIBLE] as well as\n&gt;&gt; You got to love how they change\n\n264\n00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:10.154\nthe naming on these things.\n\n265\n00:15:10.154 --> 00:15:13.668\n&gt;&gt; It was never, I don't think classic\nwas every really a naming it's just\n\n266\n00:15:13.668 --> 00:15:17.241\n[CROSSTALK] people end up calling it\nbecause that actually came long before\n\n267\n00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:21.320\nthe idea of just right-clicking and\nthat little share link that was there.\n\n268\n00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.073\nSo, just make sure you pay attention.\n\n269\n00:15:23.073 --> 00:15:24.597\nNTFS as well as this,\n\n270\n00:15:24.597 --> 00:15:29.220\nthese are very heavily tested\nareas on these types of exams.\n\n271\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.766\nYou're not gonna get away with just,\nI'm not gonna worry about that.\n\n272\n00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:36.206\nYou're gonna see that if there's gonna\nbe one of those concepts that's gonna be\n\n273\n00:15:36.206 --> 00:15:39.304\nheavily tested, one of these right here,\nespecially in this section.\n\n274\n00:15:39.304 --> 00:15:40.341\nIt's gonna hit you pretty hard.\n\n275\n00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:42.589\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie, that even reminds me,\n\n276\n00:15:42.589 --> 00:15:46.161\nwhen we're finished looking at the options\nwe have here, let's also check out those\n\n277\n00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:48.900\nNTFS permissions, to see how\nthe operating system handles it.\n\n278\n00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.827\nBecause, guess what?\n\n279\n00:15:49.827 --> 00:15:51.571\nIt doesn't handle it the same every time.\n\n280\n00:15:51.571 --> 00:15:53.642\nSo we do need to be aware of that as well.\n\n281\n00:15:53.642 --> 00:15:58.519\nAll right, so let me just hit, we'll leave\nthis Here with our full control here for\n\n282\n00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:00.759\nthis everyone group, we'll hit OK.\n\n283\n00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:05.416\nAnd a couple other, one other thing\nI wanted to show you real quick.\n\n284\n00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:10.796\nI won't spend too much time on this\nbecause, I've actually devoted an entire\n\n285\n00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:16.030\nshow on multiple ways we can perform\ncaching and similar type features.\n\n286\n00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:21.740\nBut just note that, we do have the ability\nto select right from this interface.\n\n287\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.050\nThe ability to cache\ninformation to set us up for\n\n288\n00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:31.010\noffline sharing in the future, but\nI'm just gonna hit Cancel for now here.\n\n289\n00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.498\nWe'll hit OK.\n\n290\n00:16:32.498 --> 00:16:37.789\nAnd okay, so this is what I wanted to\nshow you too when we compared those two,\n\n291\n00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:42.980\nso over here this one, this is my second,\nmy folder labeled second.\n\n292\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.180\nAnd then, let's pull up the properties for\n\n293\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:52.000\nthat folder that we had created Ronnie's\nfolder, and let's compare the two, okay.\n\n294\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.307\nSo, when I originally created this\nfirst folder, Ronnie's folder,\n\n295\n00:16:56.307 --> 00:17:00.205\nyou guys saw me, I mean,\nI just created it right here on the fly.\n\n296\n00:17:00.205 --> 00:17:03.740\nI didn't go in the backend anywhere and\nset NTFS permissions.\n\n297\n00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.600\nThere's no group policy\nthat's pushing those down.\n\n298\n00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.960\nIf I select my Security tab to\nsee how those are configured,\n\n299\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.940\nI can see that there are NTFS\npermissions set here.\n\n300\n00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.892\nSo, the operating system assumes that this\nis how they should be configured, and\n\n301\n00:17:19.892 --> 00:17:24.291\nso you might want to take a look at that\njust to see we added Ronnie in here.\n\n302\n00:17:24.291 --> 00:17:28.601\nAnd so, I didn't even set anything,\nI just shared it out with Ronnie and\n\n303\n00:17:28.601 --> 00:17:31.330\nalready has Read and execute permission.\n\n304\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.840\nHe has List folder content permissions and\nhe also has Read permissions here.\n\n305\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.270\nNow, if we look at that second\nfolder that we had created,\n\n306\n00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:43.770\nlet's take a little peek here and\nsee how that plays out.\n\n307\n00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:48.490\nWell system, obviously the operating\nsystem needs access there.\n\n308\n00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:53.330\nBut, if I were to go ahead and\njust share with someone,\n\n309\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.460\nthey actually leave it blank\nhere with the NTFS permissions.\n\n310\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.870\nSo, you need to keep that\nin mind because remember,\n\n311\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.900\nwithout NTFS permissions, they're not\ngonna have access to that resource.\n\n312\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.820\nSo if you take that more advanced option,\nthen you also need to take\n\n313\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:15.002\nthe responsibility for double checking on\nthose NTFS permissions before proceeding.\n\n314\n00:18:15.002 --> 00:18:17.898\nSo that's all I wanted to point out there,\nbut we'll just close out.\n\n315\n00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:23.780\nAnd, there are other ways to\nconfigure share permissions.\n\n316\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.790\nI think we've got five total\nthat I wanna show you.\n\n317\n00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.580\nAnd I think we have time for\nanother method here.\n\n318\n00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.240\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n319\n00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.350\neither way you get to computer management,\nit really doesn't matter here but\n\n320\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:42.880\nlet's pull up computer management,\nand I'll just full screen that for us.\n\n321\n00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.523\nIf you notice here on the left hand pane,\nthere is also an option that says,\n\n322\n00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:53.470\nshared folders and then, there's\na share so you can expand that out and\n\n323\n00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.200\nselect shares and it will pop in\nthis center pane for us right here.\n\n324\n00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.370\nAnd, so here I can see the shares\nthat we've already created.\n\n325\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.850\nMy administrative shares, and note with\nthe dollar sign at the end, I know we've\n\n326\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.210\ntalked about this on other shows,\nbut maybe you haven't heard of that.\n\n327\n00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.577\nThe dollar sign is going\nto be hiding that share.\n\n328\n00:19:13.577 --> 00:19:15.462\nIt doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.\n\n329\n00:19:15.462 --> 00:19:20.276\nBut just for the average end user,\nwe really don't want them having\n\n330\n00:19:20.276 --> 00:19:25.596\ndirect access to a C drive and being\nable to manipulate potentially harmful\n\n331\n00:19:25.596 --> 00:19:30.590\nconfigurations that affect my system\nfiles, things of that nature.\n\n332\n00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.140\nSo that's why they're hidden by\nadding that dollar sign to the end.\n\n333\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.180\nAnd you can also add a dollar\nsign to the end of the name of\n\n334\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.260\nyour share to hide that file as well.\n\n335\n00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.710\nSo, If I wanted to have a hidden folder\nwith Ronnie, I could just tell him\n\n336\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.650\nwhere it's located, and he would still\nbe able to navigate to that share.\n\n337\n00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:54.630\nBut, it's not something that is\ndisplayed via network discovery,\n\n338\n00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.110\nwhich brings me to a good point.\n\n339\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.930\nI don't think I mentioned that,\nbut we'll come back to that.\n\n340\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.880\nTalking about where we can check for\nnetwork discovery.\n\n341\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.230\nBecause, if you think about the logic\nbehind this, if network sharing and\n\n342\n00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:13.120\nif you check your network discovery\noptions, if they're not enabled,\n\n343\n00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.630\nthen you're not gonna be able on both\nends, okay, of this type of communication.\n\n344\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.573\nYou're gonna be able to\nhave that connection here.\n\n345\n00:20:20.573 --> 00:20:22.607\nSo that's definitely\nsomething to consider and\n\n346\n00:20:22.607 --> 00:20:24.800\nI'll show you how to check that as well.\n\n347\n00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.408\nBut, let's take a look at how we\ncould actually create a share from\n\n348\n00:20:29.408 --> 00:20:31.564\nwithin computer management.\n\n349\n00:20:32.627 --> 00:20:37.245\nI would simply right-click on Shares\nover my left hand pane here and\n\n350\n00:20:37.245 --> 00:20:38.550\nselect New Share.\n\n351\n00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.380\nNow, this wizard's a little different.\n\n352\n00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.029\nSo, this is just the welcome screen,\nwe'll hit Next.\n\n353\n00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:50.920\nAnd, I can specify the folder path here.\n\n354\n00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:57.630\nSo for this particular, I'm on my DM01,\nwhich is my domain number 1.\n\n355\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.880\nSo let's just go ahead and\nput it under our C drive as well.\n\n356\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.964\nNow, if I had already had a folder that\nwas sitting residing on my C drive,\n\n357\n00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:10.971\nI could navigate to it, but we also\nhave the option here under my C drive.\n\n358\n00:21:10.971 --> 00:21:13.966\nIf I hadn't created a folder\nwhich we haven't here,\n\n359\n00:21:13.966 --> 00:21:18.360\nI could also select make New Folder, and\nthen we'll just name this one three,\n\n360\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.776\nbecause this is the third folder\nthat we're creating here.\n\n361\n00:21:21.776 --> 00:21:27.060\nAnd the naming here is a little funky,\nlet me just make sure.\n\n362\n00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.507\nOkay, so you also wanna make sure\nthat this name is matching there,\n\n363\n00:21:30.507 --> 00:21:33.231\nbecause it said, new folder and\nwe don't want that.\n\n364\n00:21:33.231 --> 00:21:36.310\nSo we'll just hit OK.\n\n365\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.350\nAnd the folder that I picked is not valid,\nit's not liking this name here.\n\n366\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.190\nGive me one second,\nit might like it if I just say three.\n\n367\n00:21:44.941 --> 00:21:48.959\n&gt;&gt; I'd just go ahead and click Cancel, cuz\nI think you filling in that folder name,\n\n368\n00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:50.983\nactually, is what kinda got you there.\n\n369\n00:21:50.983 --> 00:21:51.561\n&gt;&gt; Was that it?\n\n370\n00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:53.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It just keep the new folder?\n\n371\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let me see here, let's try that.\n\n372\n00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.130\nLet's just type it in.\n\n373\n00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.090\nI'm a little OCD when it comes to naming\nand things like that, so I'm like, no,\n\n374\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.628\nit's not gonna be called New Folder here.\n\n375\n00:22:02.628 --> 00:22:04.910\nAll right, so,\n\n376\n00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:09.605\nlets create under my C drive New Folder\nand let's just call this one third.\n\n377\n00:22:09.605 --> 00:22:12.147\n&gt;&gt; No, just call it three like\nyou have it, that will work.\n\n378\n00:22:12.147 --> 00:22:12.973\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n379\n00:22:12.973 --> 00:22:15.908\n&gt;&gt; You don't have to, just don't\nchange it in the box underneath.\n\n380\n00:22:15.908 --> 00:22:17.508\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Just hit OK.\n\n381\n00:22:17.508 --> 00:22:18.150\n&gt;&gt; Let's hit OK.\n\n382\n00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.120\n&gt;&gt; See.\n\n383\n00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.777\n&gt;&gt; All right, this is why,\nwe're just replacing the folder there,\n\n384\n00:22:23.777 --> 00:22:25.949\nbecause there was a little confusion.\n\n385\n00:22:25.949 --> 00:22:27.970\nBut no worries, it's good.\n\n386\n00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.390\nAll right, so we'll hit OK,\nand we'll hit OK again.\n\n387\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.940\nWell, I'm not finished.\n\n388\n00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.860\nI still have the ability to go ahead and\nchange the share name, like we saw before.\n\n389\n00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.770\nI could put third here,\nlike we had second and two before.\n\n390\n00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.438\nI'm not gonna change that.\n\n391\n00:22:42.438 --> 00:22:47.547\nWe'll leave the path sitting\nthere under our DMO1.\n\n392\n00:22:47.547 --> 00:22:51.090\nAnd the description you could add as well.\n\n393\n00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.330\nYou could also manage those\noffline settings with cache, so\n\n394\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.340\nlike I was mentioning.\n\n395\n00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.360\nBut, we will take a look at that\na little more down the road here.\n\n396\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.050\nNow, the first, let me zoom in so\nyou can see this.\n\n397\n00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.544\nThe first three options that\nI have here within my wizard\n\n398\n00:23:07.544 --> 00:23:11.200\nare just setting a permissions here.\n\n399\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.720\nSo it says, number one, all users have\nread-only access, that's an option.\n\n400\n00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.657\nNumber two,\nadministrators have full access, but\n\n401\n00:23:20.657 --> 00:23:23.522\nother users have read-only access.\n\n402\n00:23:23.522 --> 00:23:26.812\nNumber three,\nadministrators have full access and\n\n403\n00:23:26.812 --> 00:23:29.350\nthen other users have no access.\n\n404\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.470\nSo, by selecting those,\nlet's think about that for one second and\n\n405\n00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.962\nremember how I compared those two security\ntabs to show you the NTFS permissions?\n\n406\n00:23:39.962 --> 00:23:46.070\nWith these top three options, no NTFS\npermissions are automatically generated.\n\n407\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.481\nSo that's something to consider there.\n\n408\n00:23:48.481 --> 00:23:50.212\nYou'll need to go back and check that.\n\n409\n00:23:50.212 --> 00:23:55.174\nBut, if you select custom permissions,\nthen we have the ability to really\n\n410\n00:23:55.174 --> 00:23:59.375\ngo in and set those permissions\nlike we had seen before as well.\n\n411\n00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:03.099\nSo just a couple different\noptions right there for you.\n\n412\n00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:09.147\nI'm looking at the time here,\nI think that's about it for this show.\n\n413\n00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:10.275\nBut, let's hit Finish here.\n\n414\n00:24:10.275 --> 00:24:14.780\nYou can see that particular, whoops,\n\n415\n00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.910\nlet me go back to Computer Management so\nwe can see it residing there.\n\n416\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.780\nAnd this is that third\nfolder that we had created.\n\n417\n00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.818\nSo, I think that's about it Ronnie.\n\n418\n00:24:22.818 --> 00:24:24.642\nBut on the next show we'll come back,\n\n419\n00:24:24.642 --> 00:24:29.010\nI'll show you how to double check that\nnetwork sharing and discovery option.\n\n420\n00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:33.530\nAnd, a couple other ways we\ncould actually set up shares.\n\n421\n00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:34.190\nAll right, Cherokee.\n\n422\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.000\nWell, thank you again for helping us out\nto understand a little bit more about\n\n423\n00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.090\nconfiguring the idea of share permissions.\n\n424\n00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:45.180\nRemember that when it comes down to these\ntypes of shares as Cherokee's shown,\n\n425\n00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.830\nI said there are multiple ways\nto be able to configure them.\n\n426\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.730\nBut do pay attention when\nyou configure them because,\n\n427\n00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.290\nthey also have to be combined\nwith NTFS permissions as well.\n\n428\n00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.040\nAnd when you do something like that,\nit can play a little bit if you\n\n429\n00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.900\ndon't actually understand that idea of the\nmost restrictive is gonna apply when you\n\n430\n00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.790\nare connecting from across\nthe network as well.\n\n431\n00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.610\nAlso there's another principle here\nthat we also want to make sure that we\n\n432\n00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.100\npush out of here, which is,\nwhen we talked about that idea,\n\n433\n00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.090\nthe most restrictive permissions\nthat especially when\n\n434\n00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:18.560\nit comes down to the exam, you wanna make\nsure you pay attention to the phrase.\n\n435\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.350\nWell, least administrative effort\n\n436\n00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.050\nis kinda the big one that you\nwanna pay attention to there, and\n\n437\n00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.520\neverything that we've talked about really\ndoes kinda come down to that as well.\n\n438\n00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.300\nIt's not so much that you need to\nknow every single way to do it but\n\n439\n00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.850\nyou need to know which one does provide\nthe least administrative effort,\n\n440\n00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.990\nwhen you actually are configuring this and\nwhy you would choose to do something.\n\n441\n00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.023\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n&gt;&gt; But there's a lot more for\n\n442\n00:25:39.023 --> 00:25:39.666\nus to get through.\n\n443\n00:25:39.666 --> 00:25:43.211\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I mean, for the scenario type\nquestions, or something, if I say,\n\n444\n00:25:43.211 --> 00:25:46.160\nwhat's the easiest way for\none user to share something else?\n\n445\n00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.708\nSo without sitting them down and\n\n446\n00:25:47.708 --> 00:25:51.550\nexplaining how to walk through computer\nmanagement and all that, that's what\n\n447\n00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.186\nRonnie is referencing here when you\nsay the least administrative effort.\n\n448\n00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:57.890\nSo good point, Ronnie.\n\n449\n00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a good place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n450\n00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.940\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n451\n00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.930\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n452\n00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:11.558\nStay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 show.\n\n453\n00:26:11.558 --> 00:26:17.693\n[MUSIC]\n\n454\n00:26:17.693 --> 00:26:20.919\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.311\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:12.211\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:15.379\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.830\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.040\nMore specifically, I'm going to be\naddressing course exam 70-410 and\n\n8\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.490\neven deeper into the topic of\nconfiguring share permissions.\n\n9\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.114\nAnd here to help us on this part two,\n\n10\n00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:33.051\nhe's going to be continuing with\nus is gonna be Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:34.190\nHow are you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.370\n&gt;&gt; Great, how are you Ronnie?\n\n13\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.240\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n14\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.180\nNow Cherokee, we already talked a lot\nabout some of the different ways that we\n\n15\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.460\ncan do this and\nsome of the pitfalls we're gonna see.\n\n16\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.192\nSo where are we picking up from today?\n\n17\n00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so something I wanted to cover in\nthe last show that I really make explain\n\n18\n00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.540\ntoo much is one of the pre requisites\nin order to be able to share at all.\n\n19\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.040\nAnd that's something that I wanna show\nyou here called network discovery.\n\n20\n00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.920\nSometimes network discovery may be\ndisabled for security purposes or\n\n21\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.270\nyou know, just to comply with\nyour corporate security policy.\n\n22\n00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760\nAnd we take a look at my screen,\n\n23\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.370\nI wanna show you a couple things that\nis involved with network discovery.\n\n24\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.380\nSo network discovery is a setting that\nessentially allows your device to\n\n25\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.500\nbe able to discover other devices\nin your network and vice versa.\n\n26\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.360\nSo, this particular feature\nneeds to be enabled on both\n\n27\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.028\nends of lines of communication here.\n\n28\n00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:37.660\nSo any kind of firewalls and routers need\n\n29\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.490\nto facilitate this kind of communication\nand it's not an individual protocol so\n\n30\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.120\nnot it's like I could just tell you go\ninto the firewall enable port whatever.\n\n31\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.330\nIt actually relies on\nseveral different ports.\n\n32\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.810\nIt relies on HTTP,\nrelies on port 3389, there's\n\n33\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.350\nliterally like half a dozen different port\nnumbers that you would need to configure.\n\n34\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.484\nSo if you're experiencing this link that\nI'm sharing here and in the show notes\n\n35\n00:02:03.484 --> 00:02:07.371\nit's kind of like a troubleshooting\nlink here from Microsoft and it says,\n\n36\n00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:10.101\nif you cannot turn on\nnetwork discovery in network.\n\n37\n00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:12.790\nAnd sharing center in\nWindows Server additions here\n\n38\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.006\nthen what are some things\nthat you might want to check.\n\n39\n00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:22.470\nSo what I wanna say is that there are\ndependencies for this particular feature,\n\n40\n00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.175\nso some of those dependencies would\ninclude DNS Client, function discovery,\n\n41\n00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:33.345\nresource publication, SSDP discovery,\nand UPnP Device Host.\n\n42\n00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:36.665\nSo these are gonna be services, you wanna\nmake sure are running in the background\n\n43\n00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:39.485\notherwise, network discovery\nwill not work for you.\n\n44\n00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:44.525\nAnd then also, let's take a look at\nhow we could verify in the firewall\n\n45\n00:02:44.525 --> 00:02:49.060\nto make sure that we are I'm\nallowing this service to take place\n\n46\n00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.920\nbecause just by default\nthe options that we have here.\n\n47\n00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.150\nIf we right click on top of our little,\n\n48\n00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.950\nwe might need to go full screen for\nthis real quick.\n\n49\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.409\nYeah, so if I just right click\non top of my little icon here,\n\n50\n00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.052\nand select Open Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n51\n00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:11.678\nSo if I select Change advanced sharing\ncenters, I have a couple options\n\n52\n00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:17.884\nhere where I can basically turn on network\ndiscovery for my private networks.\n\n53\n00:03:17.884 --> 00:03:22.018\nAnd then I have my different profiles\nthat Windows has available to me.\n\n54\n00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:27.840\nMy Guests or Public networks, a domain\nnetwork, or I have a cumulative or\n\n55\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.060\ncomprehensive, I should say All Network\nsettings so you could turn it on.\n\n56\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.230\nTurn on sharing so\nanyone with network access can read and\n\n57\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.250\nwrite files in public folders.\n\n58\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.887\nYou probably don't wanna do that at\nleast I wouldn't if I were working\n\n59\n00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:44.639\nwithin kind of telecommuter end users and\n\n60\n00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.376\nthey were accessing public hotspots but\nthat's just an option there.\n\n61\n00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:54.022\nNow, going through and checking these\nunder this option here, I mean it's great,\n\n62\n00:03:54.022 --> 00:03:56.950\nit works, make sure everything's on.\n\n63\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.280\nWe'll just turn everything on right now,\n\n64\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.380\nwe'll just turn it on because I'm staying\nin my domain here with this system.\n\n65\n00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.250\nWe'll hit Save changes,\nbut that's not always\n\n66\n00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.440\ngoing to be the most comprehensive\nway to check on things.\n\n67\n00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.440\nSo if you're still having issues after\nyou've enabled those concepts then you can\n\n68\n00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.230\nclick on, let me go back here\nI clicked kinda fast there.\n\n69\n00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.860\nIt just says, okay,\nI went too far back here in Control Panel.\n\n70\n00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.090\nBut you go under Windows Firewall,\nthat's where I wanted to head with you.\n\n71\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.110\nSo let's click on Windows Firewall and\nwe'll go full screen here.\n\n72\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.810\nAnd up on the top left hand\ncorner it says, Allow an app or\n\n73\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.080\nfeature through Windows Firewall.\n\n74\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.658\nSo instead of specifying all those\nnumerous ports that I had told you about,\n\n75\n00:04:44.658 --> 00:04:49.463\nwe're really just gonna be looking for\nthe actual service here.\n\n76\n00:04:49.463 --> 00:04:54.407\nAnd you can see that my\nNetwork Discovery is enabled for\n\n77\n00:04:54.407 --> 00:04:58.100\nmy domain and private networks here.\n\n78\n00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.500\nSo like I said,\nthis public profile, it's disabled.\n\n79\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.380\nSo maybe if I were going to Starbucks,\nI wouldn't want this to be\n\n80\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.640\nchecked if I was using\na public network just so\n\n81\n00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.450\nthat others couldn't find my files that\nway, but I do have some options there.\n\n82\n00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.190\nSo I just wanted to show you that in\ncase you are experiencing any kind of\n\n83\n00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.030\nissues and these shares are not\nworking like they should be.\n\n84\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.219\nSo we'll just hit OK here.\n\n85\n00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:33.339\nSo let's just recap because I still\nhave those individual folders that we\n\n86\n00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.770\nhad created in the last show or\nthose shares right here under my C drive.\n\n87\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.030\nRemember we had created Ronnie's Folder,\nand then one was called Second.\n\n88\n00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.028\nThree, so let's just go ahead and\ncreate one here that's called Four, so\n\n89\n00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:50.654\nI can keep this straight,\nwe're getting pretty high up there now.\n\n90\n00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:55.628\nSo all right, we've just created a folder\ncalled Four sitting here on our C drive\n\n91\n00:05:55.628 --> 00:05:58.200\nand we can close that off here.\n\n92\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.990\nThe other option that I wanted or\nthe other method to create and\n\n93\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.950\nmanage shares is going to\nbe a little more advanced.\n\n94\n00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.240\nAgain, we're kind of progressing here.\n\n95\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.370\nWe started with the easiest\noption just by right clicking and\n\n96\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.270\nsharing that out,\nsomething than an end user would be doing.\n\n97\n00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.590\nHowever, if you are working in\nan environment with a lot of shares,\n\n98\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.650\na lot of servers with different shares.\n\n99\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.920\nServer Manager is gonna\nbe your best bet here.\n\n100\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.320\nSo number one,\nwe have to make sure that file and\n\n101\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.870\nstorage services is enabled\nwhich by default it is.\n\n102\n00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.360\nSo you can just see that over\nhere on the left hand side and\n\n103\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.010\nI just clicked on it and\nthat changed the interface.\n\n104\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.880\nBut I do wanna show you some\nother options that we have,\n\n105\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:45.100\nthere are sub features associated with our\nparticular file and storage services here.\n\n106\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.160\nSo let me just walk through this wizard so\nI can show you the list here.\n\n107\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.810\nWe're not going to spend too much time but\n\n108\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.730\nI do want you to know that this is\na good place for you just to like,\n\n109\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.780\nwhen you're in the operating system\nplaying around, to check out.\n\n110\n00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.400\nSo if we expand this out,\nI can see that it is installed.\n\n111\n00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.250\nBut let me zoom in so\nyou can see this option.\n\n112\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.260\nUnderneath File and\n\n113\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.640\niSCSi services it currently states that\n1 of 11 of these services are installed.\n\n114\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.590\nNow, if we expand this out, these\nare gonna be some of your more advanced\n\n115\n00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.400\nconfigurations that you'll be taking a\nlook at actually like this first one here.\n\n116\n00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.230\nAnd it showed the 74 12 Adam and\nI discussed BranchCache for Network Files.\n\n117\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.165\nSo this is where you would go and\nenable that.\n\n118\n00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:33.110\nHowever, there will be additional\nconfigurations that you need to setup\n\n119\n00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.620\nwhen you're using these\nmore advanced services.\n\n120\n00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.260\nWe will be talking about Work Folders\ncoming up very shortly here in 7410, but\n\n121\n00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.244\na lot of these options, I just wanted\nto show you where you can look at.\n\n122\n00:07:44.244 --> 00:07:48.213\nAnd Microsoft even has these nice\ndescriptions over here that could help you\n\n123\n00:07:48.213 --> 00:07:51.012\nunderstand what Data Deduplication means,\nright?\n\n124\n00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:54.583\nIf you haven't already watched this\nshows or you're not familiar with that\n\n125\n00:07:54.583 --> 00:07:57.840\nterminology, then it just explains hey,\nthis is a way that we're.\n\n126\n00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.460\nDouble checking our versions here to\nmake sure we're not wasting space for\n\n127\n00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.156\nour storage.\n\n128\n00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:05.690\nSo pretty cool,\njust wanted to show you that.\n\n129\n00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.590\nBut because this service\nhas already been installed.\n\n130\n00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.750\nWe have our file in storage services.\n\n131\n00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.550\nLet's click on that and\nsee how we could create and manage shares.\n\n132\n00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.210\nCurrently, I only have\nthis one server here.\n\n133\n00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.140\nBut that's what's cool about\nusing server manager just\n\n134\n00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.490\nlike we spoke about several times before.\n\n135\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.850\nI could add additional\nservers into this pool.\n\n136\n00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.890\nOn the left hand side, I have shares.\n\n137\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:33.230\nSo, this is going to display all\nthe current shares that I have created.\n\n138\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:40.280\nNotice we have Ronnie folder,\nwe have two, three and then users.\n\n139\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.100\nNow users was created by the operating\nsystem and you might be thinking.\n\n140\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.260\nHey we just created that other folder,\nthat four.\n\n141\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.250\nWhoa we just created the folder,\nwe haven't actually set any kind of share\n\n142\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.260\nconfigurations with that\nparticular folder number.\n\n143\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.730\nSo let's go ahead and do that here.\n\n144\n00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.180\nOn the left hand side here, actually\na couple different ways you could do this,\n\n145\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.150\nI'll just stick with this drop\ndown menu here because tasks\n\n146\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:10.370\nthat's kind of their style, their design\nthat they wanna be using here but\n\n147\n00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.070\na couple different ways you could do that.\n\n148\n00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:17.330\nYou could select new share and\nwe have a couple extra options here.\n\n149\n00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.820\nSo this is more advanced than\nwhat we have seen previously.\n\n150\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.430\nThe first option I have\nis S N B Quickshare.\n\n151\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.210\nSo server message block is\nthe protocol that I can use.\n\n152\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.130\nWindows predominately uses\nwithin their environment.\n\n153\n00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.687\nHowever if I'm using a mixed\nenviroment like with nix based systems,\n\n154\n00:09:34.687 --> 00:09:38.937\nI also have the ability to create\ninterface shares.Some of these\n\n155\n00:09:38.937 --> 00:09:43.961\nconfigurations are going to require you\nto have file server resource manager\n\n156\n00:09:43.961 --> 00:09:48.830\ninstalled such as your advanced options\nhere so for this demonstration I do\n\n157\n00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.730\nnot have that installed currently so\nI'll just hit quick.\n\n158\n00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:58.222\nNow there's also an option here for\nSMB shares for applications.\n\n159\n00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:03.466\nThis is something to consider if\nyou're using any kind of API's for\n\n160\n00:10:03.466 --> 00:10:09.263\nthis share communication here,\nbecause typically when ever User per se,\n\n161\n00:10:09.263 --> 00:10:12.560\nis trying to access a shared resource.\n\n162\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.540\nThey're accessing it,\nthey're pulling it down and\n\n163\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.600\nthat connection is not\nmaintained permanently.\n\n164\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.750\nWhen you set up an application based\nstyle of share it's maintaining that\n\n165\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.150\nconnectivity for you, so\njust be aware of that.\n\n166\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.890\nFor now we'll just select quick.\n\n167\n00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.390\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, before you\nactually click on the Next here,\n\n168\n00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.630\nI like this particular screen\nbecause there is something,\n\n169\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.240\nespecially when we start\ndealing with the exam.\n\n170\n00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.670\nThere are gonna be choices that\nyou're gonna have to make.\n\n171\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.100\nAnd you might think I'll\njust gloss through this and\n\n172\n00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.920\nnot worry about it cuz it's just a wizard,\nI should be able to pick this out.\n\n173\n00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.730\nBut it may be something just as simple\nas this, what Cherokee was mentioning.\n\n174\n00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.040\nWhich one of these shares is actually\ngoing to give you that ability\n\n175\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.830\nto have that persistent opening\nthat Cherokee was talking about.\n\n176\n00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.210\nWell if you don't know, you don't know.\n\n177\n00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.700\nSo make sure you take a look\nat each of these options.\n\n178\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.870\nBefore you move on through and\nthink I 've got this thing covered.\n\n179\n00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.860\nSo just a little bit of\nan exam hint right there.\n\n180\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.230\n&gt;&gt; Good point Ronnie.\n\n181\n00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.580\nAlright so we will hit next to continue.\n\n182\n00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.240\nNow if I wanted to share on an entire\nvolume then I have the ability to do so\n\n183\n00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.320\nhere but lets point this particular share\nto that folder that we had created and\n\n184\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.850\nthat was just going to be under our\nc drive and that was labeled as Four,\n\n185\n00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.770\nright here on top.\n\n186\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:31.240\nSo we'll select that and the share name,\n\n187\n00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.840\nthat's gonna on the next\nscreen i was gonna say.\n\n188\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.030\nWe also have the ability to change that\nsharename like we've discussed previously.\n\n189\n00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.460\nWe can add in a share description and\n\n190\n00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.700\nthen i also have my additional\npath locations here.\n\n191\n00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.040\nKeeping those in that location,\nthat's exactly where i want them for\n\n192\n00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.030\nnow, We'll hit next,\nnow let me zoom in here.\n\n193\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.430\nThis page explains some additional\n\n194\n00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:02.280\nshare configuration settings which\nwe will cover in a later episode.\n\n195\n00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:09.500\nSo the first one to note here is\nAccess-based enumeration or ABE.\n\n196\n00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.600\nSo access-based enumeration is\nsimply just restricting viewing\n\n197\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.745\ncapabilities to end users who do not\nhave the rights to access that resource.\n\n198\n00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:22.825\nAllow cashing of this share so\n\n199\n00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:28.615\nthere are also additional configuration\nfeatures that Microsoft has developed\n\n200\n00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:33.565\nthat depend on cashing such as branch\ncashing and offline files that you\n\n201\n00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:37.230\nmay wanna configure in the future,\nso If you wanna leave this checked,\n\n202\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:42.830\nthen that's fine if you plan on using\nsome of those features down the road.\n\n203\n00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:48.720\nHowever, if your network is, maybe that\ngoes against your network security policy,\n\n204\n00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.550\nand you're not allowed to pull files\noff that file server to work on them.\n\n205\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.900\nYou can only work on them if you have\na direct connection or something to that\n\n206\n00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:01.380\nnature then you could also select enable,\ndeselect this option here.\n\n207\n00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.640\nBranchCache's grayed out because\nlike I said, you would have to setup\n\n208\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.980\nother configurations in order to\neven have that option as of yet.\n\n209\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.960\nAnd we also have this last option\nhere to encrypt data access, so\n\n210\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.530\nthis is really referencing the Connection,\nnot necessarily\n\n211\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.860\nencrypting the data its self, but we'll\ntake a look at that when we're talking\n\n212\n00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.560\nabout other ways that we can encrypt when\nwe're using those advanced features.\n\n213\n00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.930\nSo now we'll just hit next, and then next.\n\n214\n00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.160\nThose are my permissions,\nsorry I'm going a little fast here.\n\n215\n00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.950\nIf I wanted to customize my permissions,\nI would hit this button right here, and\n\n216\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.920\nthis, this screen should look familiar\nto you because these are our NTFS\n\n217\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.800\npermissions, and\nit kind of reminds us like hey,\n\n218\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.410\ndon't forget to configure your NTFS\npermissions, because we spoke about that.\n\n219\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.020\nBut I'm just going to hit cancel for\nright now.\n\n220\n00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.500\nI'm currently just inheriting those\npermissions From CDrive and we've spoke\n\n221\n00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.600\nabout how to disable inheritance and so\nforth but we'll just cancel our Okay.\n\n222\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:11.540\nAnd then next here and this page again,\nalways good just to screen shot,\n\n223\n00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.910\nput in your network documentation and\nwe'll hit create and\n\n224\n00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.280\nshows you your progression there,\nI'll hit close, pretty fast.\n\n225\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.580\nSometimes you may need to hit refresh\nin order to see that resource,\n\n226\n00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.760\nbut this was really relatively quick.\n\n227\n00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.250\nSo, there is one other way\nthat I wanted to show you, and\n\n228\n00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.840\nI'm sure you guessed it already.\n\n229\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.510\nThis is going to be creating\na share via PowerShell.\n\n230\n00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.940\nI don't wanna jump in and just create one.\n\n231\n00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.760\nI wanna show you a couple other things\nthat you can do here within PowerShell.\n\n232\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.200\nAnd it looks like that's gonna be it for\nmy.\n\n233\n00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.570\nLet me try to full screen that.\n\n234\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.250\nIt doesn't look like\nit wants to play well.\n\n235\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.270\n&gt;&gt; I think you'll have\nto change the font size.\n\n236\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.580\n&gt;&gt; Let me change the layout here, yeah.\n\n237\n00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.538\nGive me one second.\n\n238\n00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:55.600\nGoto properties and\n\n239\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.580\nlets change this to about 24.\n\n240\n00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.120\nAlright, is that too big can you see that?\n\n241\n00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:11.140\nThere are a lot of different commandlets\nassociated with our shares here so We\n\n242\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:16.690\nhaven't really got to PowerShell yet, but\nif you have not updated your help, then\n\n243\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:21.550\nyou might need to do that, to get all this\ninformation that I'm about to show you.\n\n244\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.930\nAlternatively, you could just hop on\nthe internet, and do a technet search, for\n\n245\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.940\nSMB commandlets,\nbecause there are quite a few.\n\n246\n00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.430\nSo I'll just show you how\nwe can get a list here.\n\n247\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:37.580\nWe're gonna type in get -help and\nthen we'll use our wildcards here by\n\n248\n00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:43.770\nspecifying an asterisk and then we'll\ntype in SMB and then another asterisk.\n\n249\n00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.230\nAnd we'll hit enter here.\n\n250\n00:15:46.885 --> 00:15:50.556\nAnd so I said I had updated my help here,\nI hadn't.\n\n251\n00:15:50.556 --> 00:15:54.196\nBut this is good because now you see what\nmay happen to you if you hadn't updated\n\n252\n00:15:54.196 --> 00:15:54.758\nyour help.\n\n253\n00:15:54.758 --> 00:15:58.511\nSo it's just asking me do you want\nto update, I'm gonna hit yes.\n\n254\n00:15:58.511 --> 00:16:02.110\nAnd then hit enter and this should just\ntake a few moments to go ahead and\n\n255\n00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.852\nupdate that.\n\n256\n00:16:02.852 --> 00:16:08.930\nBut now when I run that cmdlet I should\nbe able to retrieve that help content.\n\n257\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.790\nIt shouldn't take too long here but\nlet's see.\n\n258\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.340\n&gt;&gt; It's updating everything.\n\n259\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.940\n&gt;&gt; I know, we may need to do a TV timeout,\nbut if that's the case, then so be it so\n\n260\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.420\nwe're not taking up your time here.\n\n261\n00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.430\nPretty fast, all right, so\n\n262\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.200\nyou can see different commandlets\nthat I have available to me.\n\n263\n00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.460\nGet SNB share, remove SNB share.\n\n264\n00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.689\nThere are quite a few here.\n\n265\n00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:35.077\nAnd that's really just what\nI wanted to show you is,\n\n266\n00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:37.698\nthe functionality behind PowerShell.\n\n267\n00:16:37.698 --> 00:16:42.228\nAnd I know we've explained\nthe robustness of PowerShell before but\n\n268\n00:16:42.228 --> 00:16:47.310\nmoving forward that's really\nwhat we want to consider here.\n\n269\n00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.030\nI'm gonna clear the screen so\nwe can start working.\n\n270\n00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.870\nAnd the first thing I wanna do is look\n\n271\n00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.810\nat the shares that are already set\nup on this particular machine.\n\n272\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:05.210\nSo let's type in Get-smbshare and Enter.\n\n273\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.350\nIt's behind this little.\n\n274\n00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.139\nI'll move this down a little bit so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n275\n00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:17.305\nI always try to mess with things to make\nit better, but it just makes it worse.\n\n276\n00:17:17.305 --> 00:17:20.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Full screen it and let it go.\n\n277\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:21.800\n&gt;&gt; Just let it ride.\n\n278\n00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.680\nSo this is just because I'm using\nPractice Labs which you guys have\n\n279\n00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.370\naccess to which is great\nto play around in here.\n\n280\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.900\nSo I'm just gonna hit enter and\n\n281\n00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.170\nI can see the different shares that we've\ncreated throughout these shows already.\n\n282\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.730\nSo and of course my operating\nsystem generated shares as well.\n\n283\n00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.960\nSo these are the ones that Ronnie's\nfolder that we set up first and\n\n284\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.700\nthen we have three, four.\n\n285\n00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.620\nWe'll do five.\n\n286\n00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.330\nWe'll see where the road leads us here.\n\n287\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.860\nBut if I wanted to,\nhere let me scroll over so\n\n288\n00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.570\nyou can see the information\nthat is displayed.\n\n289\n00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.060\nWe normally have like our typical\n\n290\n00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.698\nfour columns of information\nthat PowerShell renders us.\n\n291\n00:17:59.698 --> 00:18:04.400\nBut maybe that PowerShell does have\naccess to additional information if we\n\n292\n00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.740\nwanted to hone in on one particular\nshare and extract that information.\n\n293\n00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.860\nSo what cmdlet would you use?\n\n294\n00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.010\nWell let's go ahead and\ndo that and let's type in.\n\n295\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.740\nI'm just going to use my up arrow here.\n\n296\n00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.270\nSo that's going to be\nour get smb share and\n\n297\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.080\nwe will append the word access to that.\n\n298\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.930\nSo we will say a-c-c-e-s-s and\nthen hit space.\n\n299\n00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.800\nI need to specify the share name.\n\n300\n00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.530\nSo this is important,\n\n301\n00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000\nbecause remember the folder name may be\ndifferent than the actual share name.\n\n302\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.640\nSo we see our share name listed over here.\n\n303\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.460\nLet's try Ronnie's folder.\n\n304\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.000\nNow because Ronnie's folder has a space,\n\n305\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.230\nI am probably going to be needing\nsome quotation marks here.\n\n306\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:58.210\nSo let's type in name and then Ronnie's\nFolder and we'll end that quotation.\n\n307\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.190\nAnd that should be it.\n\n308\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:06.321\nThe information that is displayed is going\nto be specific to Ronnie's folder here.\n\n309\n00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.640\nAnd it shows the different types of\npermissions that have been set for\n\n310\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.290\nthat particular resource there.\n\n311\n00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.062\nIf I wanted to create a new share,\nI could do that very easily as well.\n\n312\n00:19:18.062 --> 00:19:22.126\nThe cmdlet that I would\nuse is going to be new.\n\n313\n00:19:22.126 --> 00:19:26.616\nThis is going to be -SmbShare.\n\n314\n00:19:26.616 --> 00:19:31.436\nAnd let's specify the path.\n\n315\n00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:37.040\nSo, -Path and for this, we created four,\n\n316\n00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:44.190\nbut I haven't created\nanother folder on my C drive.\n\n317\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:51.030\nI could create one here in PowerShell or\njust right here in the GUI, either way.\n\n318\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.735\nLet's just right-click and\nwhat number are we up to now?\n\n319\n00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:58.638\n[SOUND] Five, okay, so [LAUGH] let's just\ncreate another folder and minimize that.\n\n320\n00:19:58.638 --> 00:20:00.470\nThat's sitting there on our C drive.\n\n321\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:05.630\nSo now that we have that\npath we can specify C:\\ and\n\n322\n00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.050\nthe name of that folder was five.\n\n323\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.080\nAnd we can also add our permissions here.\n\n324\n00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.620\nSo let's go ahead and\nadd those parameters.\n\n325\n00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:22.500\nThe first one is going to be we're\ngranting read access to everyone.\n\n326\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.600\nRemember that everyone group.\n\n327\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.918\nSo and then, let's go ahead an specify,\n\n328\n00:20:29.918 --> 00:20:34.990\nfull access to administrators.\n\n329\n00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.288\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, do we need to\ngive a name to the SMB share?\n\n330\n00:20:38.288 --> 00:20:38.848\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n331\n00:20:38.848 --> 00:20:39.593\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n332\n00:20:39.593 --> 00:20:44.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, let me go back here,\nlet me see, what am I missing here?\n\n333\n00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:51.600\nRight before, excuse me, right after our\npath, that's where we need to give a name.\n\n334\n00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.980\nOkay, so\nactually that's a good point, Ronnie.\n\n335\n00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.020\nSo let's hit a space, and\nthen we'll add our -name parameter.\n\n336\n00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.870\nAnd for this name,\nremember my share name can be different.\n\n337\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.310\nSo if I wanted to just put like\na number five there, I could do that.\n\n338\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.170\nBut the actual folder name would\nstill be the same here for five.\n\n339\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.849\nSo let's hit enter and see what happens.\n\n340\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.330\nAll right, so\nit's generated this share number five.\n\n341\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:24.950\nAnd if we just wanted\nto hit the get share,\n\n342\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:29.320\nwe could see that it is on our list of\nour different or particular shares here.\n\n343\n00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.560\nAnd if we wanted to just hop back and\nverify here within the GUI,\n\n344\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.870\nwe can see or Server Manager, either way.\n\n345\n00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.310\nThere are a lot of different\noptions when we're talking.\n\n346\n00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.650\nWe can hit refresh here on this page.\n\n347\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.838\nYeah, so that's something\nthat you would need to do.\n\n348\n00:21:44.838 --> 00:21:49.050\nTwo, three, four, sorry right here.\n\n349\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.450\nI'm losing my mind.\n\n350\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.880\nAll right, and now you can see that\nthat fifth one has just came in.\n\n351\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.910\nSo there are a lot of different options\nwhen it comes to shares and that's\n\n352\n00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:05.810\nreally not it when we look at data and the\nway that we access it over our network.\n\n353\n00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.697\nSo far we have talked\nabout NTFS permissions.\n\n354\n00:22:07.697 --> 00:22:09.718\nWe've just covered share permissions.\n\n355\n00:22:09.718 --> 00:22:14.295\nBut there are also additional\nconfigurations that we can use to restrict\n\n356\n00:22:14.295 --> 00:22:17.680\nor give access to users\nthroughout our environment.\n\n357\n00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.970\nSo you don't wanna miss that.\n\n358\n00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.340\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee again thank you for\nhelping us to round out a little bit more\n\n359\n00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.500\nof our knowledge in configuration shares\nright here on Windows Server 2012.\n\n360\n00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.500\nThese are very important options\nthat you have before you.\n\n361\n00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.270\nDepending on the environment\nthat you're given,\n\n362\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.100\ndepending on of course\nthe scenario that you're given.\n\n363\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.960\nYou need to be able to pick out the right\none that's actually going to help you out\n\n364\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.660\nand give you what you need to especially\nwith that idea of the least administrative\n\n365\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.520\neffort coming at you on the exam as well.\n\n366\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.440\nAnd this is also another thing for\nyou to begin some practice on\n\n367\n00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.100\neven if you haven't dived\ninto the realm of PowerShell.\n\n368\n00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.769\nYou're not going to get away with\nactually continuing on in your future or\n\n369\n00:22:56.769 --> 00:22:59.919\nin your career without understanding\nmore about PowerShell.\n\n370\n00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:02.332\nSo you gotta get used to doing it.\n\n371\n00:23:02.332 --> 00:23:03.439\nSo make sure you try and\n\n372\n00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:07.290\ntype in all the commands that you possibly\ncan using the PowerShell as well.\n\n373\n00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.970\nAll right, Cherokee, any last words?\n\n374\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.630\n&gt;&gt; No, I think you really\ncovered it there, Ronnie.\n\n375\n00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.360\nBecause there really are a lot\nof different PowerShell cmdlets,\n\n376\n00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.790\nlike I showed you guys.\n\n377\n00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.430\nJust really getting hands-on\nis the way to go there.\n\n378\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.500\nSo I think that's about it.\n\n379\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, that's a great\nplace for us to sign off then.\n\n380\n00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.340\nFor

00:00:08.029\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.300\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.890\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.670\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2,\n\n7\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.100\nspecifically for exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.130\nNow, today we're diving into, well,\nconfiguring file and share access, and\n\n9\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.240\nhere to help us out, as we continue on\nthrough, is gonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.340\nCherokee, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.810\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me,\nRonnie, back just as promised,\n\n12\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.680\nI know we talked about a lot\nof different things so far.\n\n13\n00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.370\nBut we really need to hone in on a couple\nadditional shared configurations here and\n\n14\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.120\nsome of the features that\nMicrosoft has given us.\n\n15\n00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.780\nSo the first thing I wanna talk about\nis something called Offline Files.\n\n16\n00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.370\nAnd if we take a look at my screen\nI have a really great drawing here\n\n17\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.260\nto demonstrate a generic\nidea of this concept.\n\n18\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.465\nSo, on the left hand side,\nwe have a house.\n\n19\n00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:04.050\n[LAUGH] With the man in a house.\n\n20\n00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.140\nSo if you think about working in a\nbusiness environment and then going home,\n\n21\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.630\na lot users wanna, a lot of employees may,\nnot necessarily want to but\n\n22\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.870\nthey maybe required to complete\ncertain tasks during off hours.\n\n23\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.438\nOr perhaps they're traveling, there are a\nlot of different reasons why someone would\n\n24\n00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:30.220\nwanna access information outside\nof that corporate entity.\n\n25\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.880\nSo on the right hand side over here,\nwe have our corporation.\n\n26\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.614\nNow, Offline Files is a technology\nthat Microsoft came up\n\n27\n00:01:38.614 --> 00:01:41.037\nwith to enable users to do so.\n\n28\n00:01:41.037 --> 00:01:45.781\nSo let's say inside this building\nI have my file server here, and\n\n29\n00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:51.313\nthat's where this user syncs all of his\ninformation up and stores it there.\n\n30\n00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:55.828\nBut when he goes home, maybe there's\nan Excel spreadsheet and a PowerPoint\n\n31\n00:01:55.828 --> 00:02:00.498\npresentation that he wants to work on\nduring the evening, well that's fine.\n\n32\n00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:06.875\nWith offline folders, Offline Files,\nexcuse me, I'm able to select folders and,\n\n33\n00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:10.750\nor files to be able to be\nworked with at a later date.\n\n34\n00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.350\nSo meaning, if I lose\nthe connectivity there, excuse me,\n\n35\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.990\nI have to have a VPN or\ndirect connection to sync.\n\n36\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.550\nBut I'm still able to access that file,\n\n37\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.500\nif I do lose that direct connection or\nVPN connection there.\n\n38\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.630\nThat, those two,\n\n39\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.091\nyou have to maintain a connection here\nwith Offline Files in order to sync.\n\n40\n00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:39.190\nNow, this concept has been around for\na while.\n\n41\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.040\nWe're talking Windows 2000, and\nbecause this is a server and\n\n42\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.200\nclient side functionality.\n\n43\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.490\nSo that would pair up all the way back\nto XP, Ronnie, so with that being said,\n\n44\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.880\nit is listed in the objectives for\nyour 74-10.\n\n45\n00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.276\nIt might not be the number one choice for\norganizations in today's environments.\n\n46\n00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:09.675\nBut you may be faced with a situation\nwhere something more expensive,\n\n47\n00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:16.205\nlike a rich collaboration solution, such\nas SharePoint, is not within your budget.\n\n48\n00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:20.315\nSo, just note that there\nare options like this,\n\n49\n00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:24.580\nOffline Files,\nthat don't require an expensive budget and\n\n50\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.468\nit's just piggy backing off of\nthe hardware that you already have.\n\n51\n00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:33.700\nSo, okay, Offline Files,\naka client side caching,\n\n52\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.340\nthe reason it's nicknamed that is because,\nthink about it, if we're puling that file\n\n53\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.590\ndown onto our client system it's being\ncached there until it can sync back up.\n\n54\n00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.143\nSo let's take a look at the different\nshares that we've created in\n\n55\n00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.617\nprevious episodes.\n\n56\n00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:52.275\nIf you did not have a share\nalready that you wanted to manage,\n\n57\n00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:56.024\nthen you would need to create one\nin order to use this feature.\n\n58\n00:03:56.024 --> 00:04:00.230\nSo I have an abundance here,\nlet's just select one and roll with it.\n\n59\n00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.895\nIf I right click on top of that share and\nselect properties,\n\n60\n00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:06.840\nthis is gonna bring up my properties tab.\n\n61\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.450\nBut let me zoom in here and\n\n62\n00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.880\nnote that we need to switch over off\nthe General tab unto the Sharing tab.\n\n63\n00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.745\nFrom here if we select Advanced Sharing,\n\n64\n00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:21.590\nthis'll bring us to where we need to\nbe to, I can zoom out a little bit.\n\n65\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.000\nNow we've seen this screen before,\nif we hit Caching now,\n\n66\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.521\nthis is actually where\nwe want to enable that.\n\n67\n00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:35.788\nNow, I have a couple options here,\nthe first one is where Only the files and\n\n68\n00:04:35.788 --> 00:04:40.281\nprograms that users specify\nare available offline.\n\n69\n00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:44.061\nFor me, this is my favorite,\nsimply because,\n\n70\n00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:48.321\nthe users,\nthey know what they want to be working on.\n\n71\n00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:53.226\nAnd it's not wasting any kind\nof network bandwidth as well\n\n72\n00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.700\nas storage on their local machines.\n\n73\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.491\nBeing excessive and pulling things\ndown that we don't really need.\n\n74\n00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:01.452\nSo that's why that's my favorite.\n\n75\n00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:04.631\nIf I can speak, but\nEnabled BranchCache still,\n\n76\n00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:08.583\nthat's grayed out because we do\nnot have our FRSM enabled and\n\n77\n00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:13.020\nthat will be in 70-412 you'll\ntake a look at BranchCaching.\n\n78\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.020\nNow, if I wanted to explicitly\nprevent any kind of files from\n\n79\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.660\nbeing cached down then this is\nthe option that I would select here.\n\n80\n00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.270\nSo that No files or programs from\nthe shared folder are available offline.\n\n81\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.200\nSo if I wanted to comply\nwith my security policy,\n\n82\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.940\nthen this may be a feature that\nyou'd wanna make sure is enabled.\n\n83\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.330\nAnd then lastly, my option here is for\nAll files and programs\n\n84\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.870\nthat users open from the shared folder\nare automatically available offline.\n\n85\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.730\nYou really need to select this,\nwell, with caution or\n\n86\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.880\nyou can live of the edge,\nthat's totally up to you.\n\n87\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.620\nI would like to use caution when selecting\nthis option because if there are a lot of\n\n88\n00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.890\nfiles that are dynamically being modified,\nmeaning changes happening quite often.\n\n89\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.680\nThere's gonna be a lot\nof syncs occurring and\n\n90\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.298\nthat could affect system and\nnetwork performance.\n\n91\n00:06:09.298 --> 00:06:13.340\nSo, that's why this first option is\nmy favor, we'll leave it at that.\n\n92\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.460\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee before you click on\nthe OK there, when does that optimize for\n\n93\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.520\nperformance actually not get greyed out,\nis it when we just put a check there?\n\n94\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n95\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n96\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.580\njust want to make sure sometimes you\nactually see like earlier, right, so\n\n97\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.340\nthe one that Cherokee chose there\nenabled the branch cache, right.\n\n98\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.180\n&gt;&gt; Click and nothing happening.\n\n99\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nothing's happening,\nbut the idea,\n\n100\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.210\nthe optimized performance,\nit looks the same.\n\n101\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.200\nBut then when she selects that one, that\none also gives her that option to do so.\n\n102\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.940\nNow these options are gonna be very\nimportant when you get into the exam.\n\n103\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.160\nBecause you do need to be able to pick and\n\n104\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.230\nunderstand what is\nthe difference between them.\n\n105\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.090\nWhether or not that user is just needing\naccess to a few files or does the user\n\n106\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.650\njust need access to that complete folder,\nand that is a major difference.\n\n107\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.490\nAnd Cherokee gave you some of\nthe parameters behind that.\n\n108\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.450\nWhat if the user has a smaller device\n\n109\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.740\nthat really doesn't have\nthat much storage space?\n\n110\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.720\nWell, that might be the consideration and\n\n111\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.620\nthe factor that says, well I need to\nchoose this first one over the other one.\n\n112\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.030\nOr what if the user says,\nI don't know which files I'm gonna need.\n\n113\n00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.530\nBut I do know I need\naccess to this folder.\n\n114\n00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.010\nWell, you also have to take\nthat into consideration.\n\n115\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.600\nSo don't make this choice lightly and\ndon't breeze over these options lightly.\n\n116\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.006\nMake sure you give it the due\nconsideration that it's gonna need cuz\n\n117\n00:07:28.006 --> 00:07:30.529\nyou're likely see this as\na scenario on the exam.\n\n118\n00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:34.125\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and you know what Ronnie,\nyou bring out a good point that really\n\n119\n00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:37.367\nunderstanding these selections\nthat I have available to me.\n\n120\n00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:42.220\nIn the past there were\nadditional selections when\n\n121\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.922\nit came to our syncing capabilities.\n\n122\n00:07:45.922 --> 00:07:50.188\nSo with the advent of Server 2012 and\n2012 R2,\n\n123\n00:07:50.188 --> 00:07:54.924\nwe have a Sync Center which\nactually automates this process.\n\n124\n00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:59.529\nIt was kind of a pain previously, I can't\nremember exactly how many options you had.\n\n125\n00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:03.484\nBut they were when a user logs on.\n\n126\n00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:07.930\nWhen the system is locked\nwould initiate that sync.\n\n127\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.289\nAnd those were the parameters to\ngo ahead and initiate the sync.\n\n128\n00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:13.955\nAnd it was kind of a pain\nbecause if you wanted that,\n\n129\n00:08:13.955 --> 00:08:15.825\nthere was no way to force that sync.\n\n130\n00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:20.683\nOr anything to make sure that your\nwork was on a continual basis being\n\n131\n00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:22.313\nupdated frequently.\n\n132\n00:08:22.313 --> 00:08:25.119\nYou would have to lock your screen and\nthen unlock it or whatever.\n\n133\n00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:29.920\nBut, like I said, this technology\nhas been around for a long time.\n\n134\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.770\nOver the years,\n\n135\n00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.480\nMicrosoft has been improving on\nit because people like this idea.\n\n136\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.130\nThey like this concept of\nbeing able to work from home.\n\n137\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.560\nI mean, employers love it,\nif you think about it.\n\n138\n00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.220\nSo it's not really gonna\nbe going away anytime soon.\n\n139\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.740\nAs a matter of fact,\nwe'll also discuss newer,\n\n140\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.630\nmore advanced technologies\nto really replace this.\n\n141\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.170\nI'll talk about some of the issues that\nwe may have in a few moments here.\n\n142\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.410\nBut for now, I'm just gonna hit OK\nto complete, and it's really simple.\n\n143\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:04.440\nSo this is all I need to do\nto set this particular share.\n\n144\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.900\nSo this is my server side configuration.\n\n145\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.584\nI'll just hit Close here.\n\n146\n00:09:09.584 --> 00:09:13.139\nThere's a little bit of manual\nconfiguration that we need to set up on\n\n147\n00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:14.073\nthe client side.\n\n148\n00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:17.240\nSo just give me a second and\npull that machine up.\n\n149\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.510\nI think I have a Windows 7 client\nthat we can configure here.\n\n150\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.630\nAnd it's not powered on.\n\n151\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.547\nSo this may just take one second here to\ngo ahead and power our Windows 7 client.\n\n152\n00:09:31.547 --> 00:09:35.567\nThat'll give me time to discuss\na few things as to why it's\n\n153\n00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:37.380\nnot as popular nowadays.\n\n154\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.337\nSo number one, the pro would be, like I\nexplained to you, it's cost effective.\n\n155\n00:09:42.337 --> 00:09:45.730\nMeaning I don't have to purchase\nanything additional to implement this.\n\n156\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:52.497\nBut due to the nature, so we have\nbidirectional syncing happening here.\n\n157\n00:09:52.497 --> 00:09:59.274\nSo sometimes there may be\nconflicts with the actual files.\n\n158\n00:09:59.274 --> 00:10:01.946\nAnd the users will have to determine,\n\n159\n00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:07.580\nsync center would prompt them which\nversion is going to be correct for you.\n\n160\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.936\nNow here's a thing, that would just\ncreate some anxiety from the end users.\n\n161\n00:10:11.936 --> 00:10:15.772\nBecause, let's face it, if you think\nyou've been working on this project for\n\n162\n00:10:15.772 --> 00:10:16.414\na few hours.\n\n163\n00:10:16.414 --> 00:10:19.094\nAnd then you try to open it and\nthen you get all these errors,\n\n164\n00:10:19.094 --> 00:10:20.979\nit could cause some anxiety in a network.\n\n165\n00:10:20.979 --> 00:10:25.132\nSo a lot of trouble tickets and\nadmins just didn't like dealing with.\n\n166\n00:10:25.132 --> 00:10:30.045\nSo that's one of the main reasons in\nthe way that that cache was stored wasn't\n\n167\n00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:31.416\neasily accessible.\n\n168\n00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:35.281\nYou couldn't modify it or access it\nto see what version had been there.\n\n169\n00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:39.117\nSo work folders, and we'll be\ntalking about work folders as well.\n\n170\n00:10:39.117 --> 00:10:44.090\nBut work folders was a newer option\nthat Microsoft developed to really\n\n171\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.780\nkind of phase this out.\n\n172\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.790\nBut I think my machine is up here,\nlet's test it out.\n\n173\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.250\nYeah, we're good to go here, so\n\n174\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.659\nlet's go ahead and\nconfigure that on the client side.\n\n175\n00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:57.044\nOkay great, so my Windows 7 machine is up.\n\n176\n00:10:57.044 --> 00:11:01.773\nSo what I need to do is create a map\nto drive to one of those previous,\n\n177\n00:11:01.773 --> 00:11:03.980\nwell really any kind of share.\n\n178\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.420\nSo I already had some listed there, we\nhad some listed that we'd created before.\n\n179\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.700\nThis is the machine that I wanna\nconnect to, it's PLABDMO1.\n\n180\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.960\nAnd the syntax there,\nyou would just do the \\\\ and\n\n181\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.220\ntype that UNC path for\nwherever that share was located.\n\n182\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.670\nSo again, Network Discovery\nwould need to be enabled for\n\n183\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.150\nthat communication to transpire\nto be able to get this access.\n\n184\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.290\nOnce this window is displayed,\n\n185\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.620\nI can see all those shares\nthat we've created before.\n\n186\n00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.147\nNow if I right-click on share 5,\nbecause that's the folder or\n\n187\n00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:40.400\nthe share that we've\njust enabling caching on.\n\n188\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.320\nI can right-click and then just map\na network drive to this location.\n\n189\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.832\nYou can use a different\nletter here if you want to.\n\n190\n00:11:48.832 --> 00:11:56.294\nMaybe we'll select, let's see,\nF for 5 because we're super fancy.\n\n191\n00:11:56.294 --> 00:11:59.372\nDifferent options to reconnect at log in,\njust basic Map network drive.\n\n192\n00:11:59.372 --> 00:12:02.929\nThat's all you need here to set this up,\nand we'll hit Finish.\n\n193\n00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:06.208\nNow, there's not anything\nin this folder currently.\n\n194\n00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.473\nLet's add a couple of things so\n\n195\n00:12:08.473 --> 00:12:12.580\nthat I can just show you how\ngranular it really could be.\n\n196\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:19.830\nSo let's say this is Document1 and let's\ncreate a new document here, Document2.\n\n197\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:25.411\nBecause I have the ability to not only\nshare the entire or to cache the entire\n\n198\n00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:30.473\nshare, but I can select different\nfiles if that's all I wanted to.\n\n199\n00:12:30.473 --> 00:12:34.612\nJust to, like we had talked about before,\nto save on bandwidth and so forth.\n\n200\n00:12:34.612 --> 00:12:40.975\nAll right, all I need to do at\nthis point is right-click and\n\n201\n00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:45.314\nthen select Always available offline.\n\n202\n00:12:45.314 --> 00:12:46.968\nLet me zoom in so\nyou guys can really see this.\n\n203\n00:12:46.968 --> 00:12:52.028\nBecause this is one of those important\nthings that came with Server 2012 and\n\n204\n00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:54.155\nit is available in 2012 R2.\n\n205\n00:12:54.155 --> 00:12:56.715\nIt came with Server 2012, but\n\n206\n00:12:56.715 --> 00:13:02.203\nthis is the more simplified way of\nmanaging, so you can just select this.\n\n207\n00:13:02.203 --> 00:13:07.101\nAnd what's happening now is a sync,\nall right, so we have our initial sync.\n\n208\n00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:11.973\nAnd let me see if I can pull that\nup fast enough, which down here in\n\n209\n00:13:11.973 --> 00:13:17.310\nthe bottom right-hand corner,\nif we can do full screen for a second.\n\n210\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.070\nYou can see that there's a little,\nlet me zoom in.\n\n211\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.454\nThere's that little icon happening.\n\n212\n00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:27.215\nThis is our synchronization and that's a\nshortcut to bring up our Sync Center here.\n\n213\n00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:32.090\nSo if I go ahead and click on that and\nzoom out, you can see the progress, right.\n\n214\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.292\nSo this just notes that our\nprogress has been completed.\n\n215\n00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:40.852\nNow, we had just kinda touched\non the fact that sometimes\n\n216\n00:13:40.852 --> 00:13:44.565\nconflicts do occur with\nthis configuration.\n\n217\n00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:49.450\nSo this would also be the location in your\nSync Center to verify to make sure that\n\n218\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.220\nany conflicts hadn't occurred.\n\n219\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:58.510\nAnd you can view that right over here on\nthe left-hand side, View sync conflicts.\n\n220\n00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.950\nCurrently there are no conflicts,\nthat's a plus.\n\n221\n00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.970\nBut there are also other\n\n222\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.510\ntypes of information associated with\nyour syncs that you may wanna check out.\n\n223\n00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.080\nSo this is just going to list\na history of the sync results,\n\n224\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.430\nif there was an unsuccessful sync.\n\n225\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.191\nAnd if we'll look at this,\n\n226\n00:14:16.191 --> 00:14:21.255\nit looks like our sync was completed just\na few moments ago and it was good to go.\n\n227\n00:14:24.782 --> 00:14:30.190\nNow, this one's kind of interesting,\nit's setting up new sync partnerships.\n\n228\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.906\nSo Microsoft, being a forward-thinking\ncompany, they said, you know what?\n\n229\n00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:38.892\nPeople are bringing in their devices.\n\n230\n00:14:38.892 --> 00:14:43.860\nWe need some kind of way to\nsupport the consumerization\n\n231\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.530\nof all these mobile devices\nin our environment.\n\n232\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.260\nSo setting up a new sync share partnership\n\n233\n00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.430\nwould enable you to\nutilize mobile devices.\n\n234\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.510\nHowever, like I said, here in 2017, there\n\n235\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:06.310\nare more advanced options to really work\nwith mobile devices, such as work folders.\n\n236\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.040\nAnd then also other collaboration\ntools like OneDrive and\n\n237\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.480\nall sorts of really cool things.\n\n238\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.860\nSo just know that this is kind\nof like the beginning there.\n\n239\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.790\nYou could also manage your\noffline folders here as well.\n\n240\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.790\nBut pretty simple to set up from\nthe client side, I mean, and\n\n241\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:29.110\nyou're giving them the ability\nto really select what folders.\n\n242\n00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.500\nLet me just back out of here and\nthen open this back up.\n\n243\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.690\nI wanna see something, okay,\nthat's what I wanted to show you.\n\n244\n00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.964\nYou can see that this little symbol here,\nthat sync symbol,\n\n245\n00:15:39.964 --> 00:15:44.416\nis referencing that this document is\nthe document that's being synched.\n\n246\n00:15:44.416 --> 00:15:50.638\nHowever, Document 2 is not, so that's\njust something to be aware of there.\n\n247\n00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:57.350\nNow Working with offline files.\n\n248\n00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.610\nYou have the ability to really\nmanage them through group policies.\n\n249\n00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.550\nSo I'd just wanna show\nyou a couple of things\n\n250\n00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.880\nthat you could do to work with\ngroup policy with offline force.\n\n251\n00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.662\nSo what I'm gonna do is just go ahead and\ntype in gpedit, and\n\n252\n00:16:13.662 --> 00:16:16.626\nshow you a couple of those .msc, and\n\n253\n00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:20.754\npull up our\nGroup Policy Management Console here.\n\n254\n00:16:23.084 --> 00:16:25.838\nOkay, so\nI have to drill down a little bit.\n\n255\n00:16:25.838 --> 00:16:30.710\nThis is gonna be underneath computer\nconfiguration over on my left hand side\n\n256\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.640\nand it's already expanded out.\n\n257\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.620\nUnderneath computer configuration, you'll\nneed to drill down to administrative\n\n258\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.300\ntemplates and we'll just expand that out.\n\n259\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.590\nI don't know if you can see that, but I'll\ngive you the path as well in the notes.\n\n260\n00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.470\nAnd then we have Network.\n\n261\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.500\nExpand out Network, and\n\n262\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.200\nunderneath Network,\nyou'll find the folder Offline files.\n\n263\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.690\nThis is where there are plenty\nof different policies that\n\n264\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.050\nyou can configure here.\n\n265\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.150\nSo a couple that I wanted to show you\nhere, exclude files from being cached.\n\n266\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.490\nSo let's take a look at that and\nlet's zoom in a little bit.\n\n267\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:15.420\nJust playing around, sorry I'm trying to\nfind a good spot for us to look at this.\n\n268\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.170\nCurrently we can see that\nthis is not configured.\n\n269\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.730\nNow I'm not saying you have\nto configure all of these.\n\n270\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.670\nBut it would just be nice for\n\n271\n00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.570\nyou to know that the options do exist here\nwithin group policy, with our editor.\n\n272\n00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:34.420\nSo the idea behind excluding\nfiles from being cached\n\n273\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.110\nwould be certain types of files, like\nour If you think about file extensions.\n\n274\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.540\nAnd if you think about databases,\nand the way databases work,\n\n275\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.110\nthey are really designed\nto work as a unit, a whole.\n\n276\n00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:53.020\nSo these individual .mdb file\nextensions and different\n\n277\n00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:58.170\nkinds of database file extensions, may be\nsomething that you would want to consider.\n\n278\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.300\nBecause those files really\nwere not designed to be worked\n\n279\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.140\noutside of that database environment and\nbrought down to that local machine and\n\n280\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.610\nthen being cache and synced back up.\n\n281\n00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.040\nSo just kinda calling those out there.\n\n282\n00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.240\nJust playing around in here and\n\n283\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.020\nlooking at the different types\nof settings that we have.\n\n284\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.610\nBut a couple of others let's see.\n\n285\n00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.210\nConfigure slow link mode.\n\n286\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.770\nThat's another thing that I\nwanted to mention as well.\n\n287\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.620\nSo let's find that, if I can see here.\n\n288\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.100\nConfigure slow link mode.\n\n289\n00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.200\nAnd of course, there it is.\n\n290\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.770\nNot in alphabetical order.\n\n291\n00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.420\nSlow link mode is the option\n\n292\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.360\nto have the system be able to detect,\nand I cannot remember the default.\n\n293\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.150\nLet's see if we can find that in here,\nNext Setting.\n\n294\n00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.680\nOkay, actually there's zero in here for\nthat default.\n\n295\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.230\nYou can specify your bits per second for\n\n296\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.240\nthe actual speed to say\nWhat do you feel is slow?\n\n297\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.040\nAnd then the operating system, let me zoom\nin so you guys can see that right here for\n\n298\n00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.120\nyour options.\n\n299\n00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:16.820\nSo once the connection drops beneath this\nthreshold that you're studying here,\n\n300\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.060\nit will go ahead and\nenable this feature or disable it so\n\n301\n00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.470\nyou're not trying to transmit\nduring a slow link moment in time.\n\n302\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:32.029\nThere are a lot of different ways\nyou can configure this, but I think\n\n303\n00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:38.860\nit's more important to spend a majority\nof time really configuring work folders.\n\n304\n00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.410\nBecause like I said,\nit's important to understand and\n\n305\n00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.180\nknow how offline files will work.\n\n306\n00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.880\nBecause you may enter\na solution where offline files\n\n307\n00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.400\nis the viable solution for you.\n\n308\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.280\nBut work folders is probably\ngonna be more common.\n\n309\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.360\nSomething that you may entire so I just\nkinda wanted to throw that out there.\n\n310\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.140\nAnd if we're looking at the pros and\n\n311\n00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.600\ncons like why one or\nthe other I've also included the link for\n\n312\n00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.590\nyou so maybe if you just wanted to peruse\nthat and do a little more reading on,\n\n313\n00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.790\nwhy would I want to use offline\nfiles versus work folders?\n\n314\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.410\nWork folders, yeah,\nit's a little more involved.\n\n315\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.950\nWe have to set that up.\n\n316\n00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.810\nMaybe this is the option for you.\n\n317\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.850\nBut I've already noted some of those\nthings, like some of those conflicts.\n\n318\n00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.070\nAnd you might have a little bit more\nmanagement as far as troubleshooting,\n\n319\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.770\ndealing with those end user complaints.\n\n320\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.410\nBut it's just completely up to you.\n\n321\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.450\nAnd how you wanna go ahead and\nset that up.\n\n322\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:40.970\nIf you wanna take advantage of more\nadvanced security features and integrate\n\n323\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.730\nwith Active Directory federated services,\nthen work folders is the way to go.\n\n324\n00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.760\nBut you do have some limited\noptions here with offline files.\n\n325\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.992\nAnd I think that's about it Ronnie.\n\n326\n00:20:50.992 --> 00:20:54.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee well, thank\nyou again for helping us out here and\n\n327\n00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.700\ntaking a look especially\nthis idea of offline files.\n\n328\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.800\nIt is a good utility to think\nabout especially in those areas\n\n329\n00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.540\nwhere you may not be able to remain\nconnected for your VPN connection or\n\n330\n00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.490\nyou have a link which is\nnot gonna be sufficient.\n\n331\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.170\nEspecially if we have a lot of files\nthat do need synchronization as well.\n\n332\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.340\nSo the idea of actually being\nable to configure this,\n\n333\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.440\nand and getting it setup, and seeing an\nexample of it, is a good thing for us, and\n\n334\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.810\nthere's a lot more for\nus to take a look at as well.\n\n335\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.050\nAll right, Cherokee,\nany last minute words here?\n\n336\n00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.520\n&gt;&gt; You know Ronnie, I did have one last\nminute thought here, I always do, right?\n\n337\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.150\nThere were a couple other features\nthat Microsoft does allow for,\n\n338\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:38.300\nthat to work offline files Supports.\n\n339\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.110\nOne is going to be transparent caching and\n\n340\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:46.200\nthen the other is going to be branch\ncache, which those are more advanced.\n\n341\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.490\nBut I just want you to know\nlike with transparent cache,\n\n342\n00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.980\nlike you had just mentioned\nhaving that VPN or\n\n343\n00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.253\ndirect connection to perform\nthat sync is required for\n\n344\n00:21:57.253 --> 00:22:01.840\nour offline files.\n\n345\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.460\nThat type of connection\nis not required for\n\n346\n00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:09.300\nwork folders and\nas long as that server is up and\n\n347\n00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.520\nI'm able to communicate then that's\na good to go with offline files.\n\n348\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.050\nI just wanted to mention those two\nothers because sometimes you'll\n\n349\n00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.180\nhear the term on transparent caching.\n\n350\n00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:23.240\nJust know transparent caching\nworks with the offline files to\n\n351\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:28.310\nbring a copy there locally for a period\nof time, but it is not 100% reliable.\n\n352\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.520\nIt's not a replacement file for\n\n353\n00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.170\noffline files, because if that server,\nif they do lose connectivity,\n\n354\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.338\nthen transparent caching is not\ngoing to continue to function.\n\n355\n00:22:37.338 --> 00:22:44.570\nSo offline files is a solution for that\noffline work, just like the name implies.\n\n356\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.602\nOkay, no more, I promise.\n\n357\n00:22:47.602 --> 00:22:50.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee well, that's\na great place for us to end this up,\n\n358\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.070\nso then.\n\n359\n00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.670\nSigning off for\nITProTV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n360\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.623\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n361\n00:22:55.623 --> 00:23:00.935\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned

00:00:07.640\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.530\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.083\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:19.250\nYou're watching the MTSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.140\nSpecifically for exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.800\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n9\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.690\nwe're actually going into a part two on\nconfiguring well file access as well and\n\n10\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.580\nhere to help us out of course is\ngoing to be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.800\nCherokee welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.850\n&gt;&gt; How's it going Ronnie?\n\n13\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.000\n&gt;&gt; It is going well now Cherokee we've\nalready gone over some of the different\n\n14\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.420\ntechniques and we're about to dive into\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much a larger technique here,\n\n15\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.590\nand something we really actually\nneed to understand fairly well.\n\n16\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we looked at offline files,\nand offline files is a good start.\n\n17\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.570\nRemember we had said it came,\nyou know, Windows 2000 XP days, so\n\n18\n00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.952\nit's been around for a long time, it might\nneed a little bit of an improvement here.\n\n19\n00:00:56.952 --> 00:01:00.938\nAnd that's exactly what Microsoft to\nhave in mind when they established work\n\n20\n00:01:00.938 --> 00:01:01.499\nfolders.\n\n21\n00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.198\nSo that's what we'll be\ntalking about in this show and\n\n22\n00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:06.202\nprobably the subsequent shows as well.\n\n23\n00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:11.130\nBecause work folders is something that\nis a great feature to have within your\n\n24\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.212\norganization.\n\n25\n00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:17.300\nIt doesn't cost anything additional so\njust like we just saw with\n\n26\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.480\nour offline files I don't need\nto have any additional expenses.\n\n27\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.410\nI can leverage my current network and\n\n28\n00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.440\nthe hardware I have to deploy this\ntype of feature throughout my network.\n\n29\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.480\nThe only thing with work folders\nis Is that the initial set\n\n30\n00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.520\nup on the server side set\nup is pretty in depth.\n\n31\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.610\nI mean,\nwe're talking additional features here,\n\n32\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.890\nwe're talking about end to end security,\nso we're relying on certificates.\n\n33\n00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.120\nSo just making sure we have everything\nironed out is something that we\n\n34\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.400\nreally need to pay attention to.\n\n35\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.720\nNow In real life you usually just set that\nup once and kinda let it rest there or,\n\n36\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.270\nyou know, it's not very often that\nyou'll be setting up the server side.\n\n37\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.610\nClient side, that happens all the time and\nclient side set-up and\n\n38\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.270\nconfiguration is super easy, so\nthat's great for you guys out there.\n\n39\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.870\nIn this show, I really wanna explain\nwhat work folders is, what it does, what\n\n40\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.920\nit doesn't do, and then we'll go through\nthe process of actually setting it up.\n\n41\n00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.690\nSo if you can bear with me then,\nwe'll get through this together.\n\n42\n00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.990\nAnd, if you take a look at my screen,\nI kinda wanna just explain the layout\n\n43\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.160\nof this concept here, because we have\nsome logical thought processes and\n\n44\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.550\nthen we also have some\nphysical designs as well.\n\n45\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.610\nWith our offline folders that we had\nseen we really needed that VPN or\n\n46\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.790\ndirect connection to establish\nthat synchronization connection.\n\n47\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.860\nHowever, with work folders all we\nneed is an internet connection.\n\n48\n00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.600\nAs a matter of fact, our devices\ndon't even have to be domain joined.\n\n49\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.290\nAnd so before the show Ronnie and\nI were just talking about this idea and\n\n50\n00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.230\nguys, when I first started, we didn't\neven have all these crazy devices,\n\n51\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.100\nall these iPads and smart phones.\n\n52\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.380\nPeople really didn't even think of,\nit wasn't even an option here.\n\n53\n00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.450\nBut now that's something that\nyou'll see all the time.\n\n54\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.610\nBusiness love it because if they can\ntake that 40 hour work week employee,\n\n55\n00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.740\nand then turn them into kinda like\nan always an employee, it's great.\n\n56\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.791\nSo you're not gonna really see\na lot of opposition there and\n\n57\n00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:30.744\nthat's why tis technology was developed\nand it just kinda flourished.\n\n58\n00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:35.707\nHere in this diagram I have devices that\ncan connect back to the file server, so\n\n59\n00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:39.465\nonce we set up work folders on\nour file server, like I said,\n\n60\n00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:43.200\nit's really simple for\nthose devices to connect.\n\n61\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.039\nYou can utilize a firewall or\neven a reverse proxy here,\n\n62\n00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.811\ndepending on how you wanna\nset that configuration up.\n\n63\n00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:55.410\nNow I will look at the details for\nthe end to end security.\n\n64\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.630\nYou do have the option here at your\nperimeter to break that security for\n\n65\n00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.030\nSSL offloading any kind of deep packet\ninspection there but that's not default.\n\n66\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.200\nThey really thought about Securing the\ninformation from beginning to end here.\n\n67\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.610\nThen what happens if one of these devices\nare compromised, lost stolen whatever.\n\n68\n00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.950\nBecause people are really, it's kind of a\ngreat area when you think about hey Rony,\n\n69\n00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.460\nwhat do you have on your mobile phone?\n\n70\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.620\nDo you have your work email set up on\nyour mobile phone, most people do.\n\n71\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.310\nDo you have pictures of your daughter's\nBirthday on your mobile phone,\n\n72\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.690\nwell a lot of people have personal\ninformation on their phone as well, so\n\n73\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.420\nwe're able to gradually select and perform\nselective remote wipes on these devices.\n\n74\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.800\nSo I think Microsoft was really listening\nto what businesses had to say for\n\n75\n00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.400\ntheir environments and\nthen built this technology around that.\n\n76\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.650\nSo, this technology came out in, it was\nreleased with server 2012 and 2012R2.\n\n77\n00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.130\nThey had this available but at the time\nthere was also another feature out called\n\n78\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.150\nSkydrive and\nSkyDrive was what we now know as OneDrive.\n\n79\n00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.550\nAnd when that technology\noriginally was pushed out,\n\n80\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.840\nit was more for the consumer space,\nfor retail use.\n\n81\n00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.500\nIt wasn't for industry or enterprise side.\n\n82\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.800\nAnd it wasn't until SkyDrive Pro,\neven with the advent of that emerged, and\n\n83\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.080\nthen it turned into OneDrive.\n\n84\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.420\nSo, today,\nwell during the time of this recording,\n\n85\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.210\nOneDrive would kind of be like\nthe replacement for work folders here.\n\n86\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.550\nBecause it just kind of morphed and\nevolved into that.\n\n87\n00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.710\nBut you do see those additional\nlicensing expenses attached to that.\n\n88\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.760\nSo here,\nthis is kind of like a middle ground.\n\n89\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.510\nIt offers more features and\nsecurity than those offline files.\n\n90\n00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.890\nBut without the expense of having\nany kind of SharePoint solution and\n\n91\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.410\nintegrated with your OneDrive there.\n\n92\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.240\nSo talking about authentication,\nso here's the thing.\n\n93\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.480\nI said that your clients do\nnot have to be domain joined.\n\n94\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.170\nHowever, the server does\nhave to be domain joined.\n\n95\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:12.150\nAnd those devices and\nclients connecting via domain credentials,\n\n96\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.440\nof domain joined devices,\nlet me just say that.\n\n97\n00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.360\nThey're going to be utilizing Kerberos for\nauthentication.\n\n98\n00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.500\nThose non domain devices are going to be\nutilizing Digests for authentication, and\n\n99\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.660\nwe also have the ability to integrate\nwith Active Directory Federated Services\n\n100\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.850\nto add really cool features like\nmulti factor authentication and\n\n101\n00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.299\nenhance the security there.\n\n102\n00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.370\nWe're gonna be connecting via an URL so\n\n103\n00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.610\nit's going to be just a basic work folders\ndot and then you'll put the domain.\n\n104\n00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.260\nSo ITProDemo or in our case we'll be\nusing practice labs as our demo so\n\n105\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.360\nthat's what you'll be seeing\nthroughout the shows here but\n\n106\n00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.630\nyou have a couple of different options.\n\n107\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.100\nThe end user can just put\ntheir email address in and\n\n108\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.200\nthat's how that URL information\nis shared with them.\n\n109\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.960\nOr you can explicitly put out the URL.\n\n110\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.240\nEspecially if you have multiple\nshares within your environment and\n\n111\n00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.580\nwe'll take a look at that in a few\nmoments, and how that's handled.\n\n112\n00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.110\nSo, the logical system overview is that we\nenable file and storage services sub-role.\n\n113\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.600\nIf you recall, I think I had showed\nyou guys under the add rules and\n\n114\n00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.990\nfuture section, you saw that little\nsub-role that was called work folders.\n\n115\n00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.120\nSo, it's just part of that file and\nstorage subset there, fyi.\n\n116\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.000\nSo this is interesting they've\ncreated an additional access protocol.\n\n117\n00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.481\nSo this was actually a new protocol\ndeveloped by Microsoft to handle\n\n118\n00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:44.818\nthis type of transportation,\nlike the end to end security here.\n\n119\n00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:49.573\nIt provides a consolidated view of\nsync activity across your server,\n\n120\n00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:52.484\nreally good for centralized management.\n\n121\n00:07:52.484 --> 00:07:55.590\nAnd if you think about it,\nthat was really the whole concept,\n\n122\n00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.879\neven thinking back to file storage, right?\n\n123\n00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:00.060\nWe have a centralized location where.\n\n124\n00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.769\nI really don't have to be\ntoo concerned if so and\n\n125\n00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:07.940\nso's computer is infected with malware, or\nthey have a catastrophic hardware failure.\n\n126\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.560\nI can't just rely on that centralized\naccess there, and this is really seamless.\n\n127\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.280\nSo the end users are just using all\nof their home direct directories and\n\n128\n00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.030\nthose home directories are being\nsynced back to that server so\n\n129\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.890\nthat if there was some type of issue then,\nyou know, hey we've got our backups,\n\n130\n00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.160\nwe really don't need to worry about it.\n\n131\n00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.774\nNow, you can have multiple\nsync shares per server.\n\n132\n00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:35.310\nIt gets a little fuzzy whenever\nyou're talking about the individual,\n\n133\n00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:37.360\nwhat's the word that they use?\n\n134\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.355\nPartnerships with devices.\n\n135\n00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:45.390\nSo if I had a mobile phone, you can't have\nmultiple partnerships with multiple syncs\n\n136\n00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.860\nthere, so there are some limitations but\neach share maps to a file system location.\n\n137\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.979\nSo that information is being stored,\nultimately,\n\n138\n00:08:54.979 --> 00:08:59.200\non a physical portion of\nsome hard drive space there.\n\n139\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.411\nIt can be the same as SMB or NFS or\n\n140\n00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:08.080\neven just it's own unique without the SMB\nshare of the SMB protocol being utilized.\n\n141\n00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.763\nAnd what that means is with this\ntechnology we saw it being used with,\n\n142\n00:09:12.763 --> 00:09:15.670\nit first came out with Windows 8.1, but\n\n143\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.824\nthen they created backwards\ncompatibility for Windows 7.\n\n144\n00:09:19.824 --> 00:09:23.093\nIt's compatible with Windows 10 and\n\n145\n00:09:23.093 --> 00:09:27.958\nit's also compatible with iOS devices,\niPhone, iPad.\n\n146\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:33.259\nIf we're working with devices that\naren't supported, like legacy devices,\n\n147\n00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:38.003\nthen you can also put those SMB shares\non the same server right in the same\n\n148\n00:09:38.003 --> 00:09:42.907\nlocation, in the same directory as\nthe work folders directory like we had\n\n149\n00:09:42.907 --> 00:09:47.680\nseen in the previous show, I showed\nyou how to set those SMB shares up.\n\n150\n00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.802\nSo that's kind of cool to\ngive you that option there.\n\n151\n00:09:51.802 --> 00:09:56.162\nUsers and groups associated with\na single share, yes, you can have users\n\n152\n00:09:56.162 --> 00:10:01.160\nassociated with multiple shares, but\nthat's when it's not recommended.\n\n153\n00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.930\nAnd it's really not any kind of\nlimitation of the software but\n\n154\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.490\nit's more of confusion on the end user's\nside because they see multiple folders and\n\n155\n00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.140\nthen they're like, I don't need all these\nextra folders, and they delete them.\n\n156\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.570\nBut the synchronization works,\nthat change on the device\n\n157\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.070\nis being sent up to that server and it\nactually deletes the files on the server.\n\n158\n00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.190\nSo it's kind of an issue with that.\n\n159\n00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.390\nAnd actually I'll go back to that other\nslide here when we're finished with this\n\n160\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.400\none to kind of show you\nhow that process works.\n\n161\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.000\nAnd we try to limit access to those\nmultiple sync shares per user, but\n\n162\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.880\nthe ultimate goal for an organization\nis to satisfy their corporate policies.\n\n163\n00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:49.490\nSo you wanna make sure you are still\nstaying within your corporate policies.\n\n164\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.614\nAnd abiding by any kind of, maybe you have\nregulatory compliances and restrictions.\n\n165\n00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:58.168\nSo my shipping department may have loose\nrestrictions compared to something like\n\n166\n00:10:58.168 --> 00:10:58.964\naccounting.\n\n167\n00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:03.057\nSo in order to be in compliance with those\npolicies and how that data is managed,\n\n168\n00:11:03.057 --> 00:11:06.435\nyou may want to just go ahead and\ncreate those individual shares.\n\n169\n00:11:07.925 --> 00:11:11.395\nFiles stay in sync across all devices and\nthat I'll go back and\n\n170\n00:11:11.395 --> 00:11:13.555\nshow you how that works here in a second.\n\n171\n00:11:13.555 --> 00:11:17.740\nLocal changes sync back to the server and\nthen to other devices.\n\n172\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.830\nAnd then we see that asynchronous\nhub &amp; spoke transmission and\n\n173\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.412\nI'll explain what that means.\n\n174\n00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:26.405\nOur SMB clients can continue to work\ndirectly with the file serves also,\n\n175\n00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:27.760\nlike I had noted.\n\n176\n00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.737\nSo let's go back here and let me just\nkind of explain how this process works.\n\n177\n00:11:32.737 --> 00:11:37.470\nSo let's say I am on my iPad and\nI'm working on a document and\n\n178\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.836\nI need to save, first of all,\n\n179\n00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:45.350\nI have to obtain that document from\nthe file server, I make a change.\n\n180\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.250\nSo, this is the device,\n\n181\n00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.770\nthe iPad is responsible for\nany kind of change within that document.\n\n182\n00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.200\nWhenever I go, there's a pulling interval,\ndefault 10 minutes.\n\n183\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.852\nAnd whenever the system detects a change,\nor I hit File &gt; Save As, and initiate\n\n184\n00:12:01.852 --> 00:12:07.480\na change, then that particular document\nwill be sent back to this file server.\n\n185\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.130\nIf, let's say I switched to my\nlaptop within that 10 minutes and\n\n186\n00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.940\nI make a different change on\nthe same file on my laptop and\n\n187\n00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.350\nthat pulling period hasn't completed,\nthat may create a conflict.\n\n188\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.790\nOr if I'm crazy and\nI'm saving multiple files, or\n\n189\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.510\nthe same file on multiple devices.\n\n190\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.500\nSo, with offline files,\n\n191\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.980\nthe user was responsible for\nany kind of conflict reconciliation.\n\n192\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.330\nYou would receive a little notification,\nand it would say okay,\n\n193\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.489\nwhich version do you want to keep?\n\n194\n00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.033\nApparently, there was a lot of\nfeedback that it was just too much for\n\n195\n00:12:45.033 --> 00:12:47.477\nthe end users to make that decision.\n\n196\n00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:52.937\nSo what they did with work folders was\nremove that decision making process and\n\n197\n00:12:52.937 --> 00:12:58.817\nthey said, look, what we're going to do is\nlook at that time stamp information and\n\n198\n00:12:58.817 --> 00:13:01.085\nthe file that was created last so\n\n199\n00:13:01.085 --> 00:13:06.214\nthe newest file is the one that will\nbe served off as the most recent file.\n\n200\n00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:11.262\nHowever, the other versions are still\nsaved on a file server available for\n\n201\n00:13:11.262 --> 00:13:11.910\naccess.\n\n202\n00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:18.860\nAnd it's kind of interesting if\nthere are multiple conflicts.\n\n203\n00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.900\nSo the file name is actually\nappended with the device name,\n\n204\n00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.740\nso if this was like Cherokee's iPad,\nthe file name would be the name\n\n205\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:33.140\nof the document appended with Cherokee's\niPad and then the number 1 after it.\n\n206\n00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.410\nAnd it would actually save up\nto 100 different changes, so\n\n207\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.830\nit would append that\nfile name even up to 100,\n\n208\n00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:43.020\nbut then after 100, it says look,\nthere's something going on here.\n\n209\n00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.920\nAnd it'll push out\na notification to that device\n\n210\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.540\nto make that user then handle\nconflict resolution there.\n\n211\n00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.230\nI'm trying to think.\n\n212\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.000\nThere's a lot here with this.\n\n213\n00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.990\nIf I make the change on the iPad I send it\n\n214\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:05.050\nup to the server,\nthe server will always handle pushing\n\n215\n00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:10.080\nthat change out to all the other\nconnected devices for that user.\n\n216\n00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.900\nSo it's never a change that's\npushed from iPad to cell phone,\n\n217\n00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.270\nor, you know, iPad to laptop.\n\n218\n00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.110\nIt always goes through that\nhub &amp; spoke topology, and\n\n219\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.080\nthat's what they're referencing there.\n\n220\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.608\nJust kind of throwing that out there.\n\n221\n00:14:26.608 --> 00:14:30.052\nAll right, what else do we need to\nthink about before we get started here?\n\n222\n00:14:30.052 --> 00:14:31.890\nOkay, so we do have some options here,\n\n223\n00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.910\nwhen we're talking about how\nare we gonna be deploying this.\n\n224\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.240\nSo in a corporate environment, number one,\nlike I said, you want to maintain\n\n225\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.900\nwith your corporate security policies,\nyour network access policy.\n\n226\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.910\nSo when we look at network access\ncontrol we have three main\n\n227\n00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.510\noptions that were in mind when\never work folders was deployed.\n\n228\n00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.170\nYou have a manual option.\n\n229\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.660\nSo the auto discovery feature of this\nserver URL is based on email address.\n\n230\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.022\nLike I said it's easy for the end users\nto remember their email address, and\n\n231\n00:15:00.022 --> 00:15:02.758\nthat's the easiest way\nto get that URL to them.\n\n232\n00:15:02.758 --> 00:15:06.610\nWe have explicit entry of\nsync server to the URL.\n\n233\n00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:11.910\nSo, obviously I have to give you\naccess to that URL, it's explicit.\n\n234\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.840\nAnd that's what they're referencing there.\n\n235\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.660\nNow opt-in, this is where the settings\nare delivered via Group Policy.\n\n236\n00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.920\nOr if you're using any kind of system\nmanagement utility like System Center or\n\n237\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920\nIntune.\n\n238\n00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:28.640\nSo they do have the option to select if\nthey wanna use work folders, but they're\n\n239\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.620\nnot gonna select how those policies\nare pushed down and how they're managed.\n\n240\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.160\nOn the administrative side,\nwhen we're setting this up you'll also see\n\n241\n00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.000\ncertain configuration options\nthat we have to choose.\n\n242\n00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.711\nSo, for instance, admins have\nthe ability to look at all those files\n\n243\n00:15:46.711 --> 00:15:49.159\nthat are stored in the file server.\n\n244\n00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:51.731\nBut what if that's a security\nissue within your organization and\n\n245\n00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:53.987\nyou don't even want the admins\nto be able to look at that?\n\n246\n00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:59.041\nWell that is also an option so\nthere will be optional pop up Window on\n\n247\n00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:04.029\nthat client side device saying\nanything you need to comply with.\n\n248\n00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:09.001\nSo if there are certain policies like\nhey We have to have this device password\n\n249\n00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:12.352\nprotected, auto lock and\nany form of encryption.\n\n250\n00:16:12.352 --> 00:16:16.369\nIt will notify and they will have\nto comply before proceeding.\n\n251\n00:16:16.369 --> 00:16:20.659\nSo that's just something that you\ncan set there to make sure you're\n\n252\n00:16:20.659 --> 00:16:24.058\ncompletely transparent\nwithin your organization.\n\n253\n00:16:24.058 --> 00:16:28.877\nNow, Mandatory, these settings are going\nto be delivered via Group Policy.\n\n254\n00:16:28.877 --> 00:16:33.439\nAnd we again we'll be using some kind of\nmanagement utility like Systems Center or\n\n255\n00:16:33.439 --> 00:16:33.978\nIntune.\n\n256\n00:16:33.978 --> 00:16:37.853\nAnd I have explicit entry again\nvia that sync server, but\n\n257\n00:16:37.853 --> 00:16:42.779\nthere's no option, like that device\nwill be utilizing this technology\n\n258\n00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:45.054\nif that's the way I choose to go.\n\n259\n00:16:45.054 --> 00:16:47.933\nLooking at the end-to-end security.\n\n260\n00:16:47.933 --> 00:16:52.433\nSo number one, we've already talked\nabout our NTFS permissions, right?\n\n261\n00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:56.218\nSo those are still gonna be in\nexistence and be factors as well.\n\n262\n00:16:56.218 --> 00:16:59.854\nAnd then you're also going to give\npermission to the actual Sync Share.\n\n263\n00:16:59.854 --> 00:17:04.430\nSo I am choosing obviously with our\ndomain and non-domain joined devices,\n\n264\n00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.506\nthose users can enter their\ndomain credentials for\n\n265\n00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:10.882\nthose non-domain devices\nto get connectivity there.\n\n266\n00:17:10.882 --> 00:17:14.760\nThe protocol that we're using\nhere is going to be SSL.\n\n267\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.196\nIf we think about offline files,\noffline files actually utilize port 80, so\n\n268\n00:17:19.196 --> 00:17:20.531\nwhat does that tell us?\n\n269\n00:17:20.531 --> 00:17:23.921\nThey were basing that off HTTP protocol.\n\n270\n00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:29.074\nWith work folders,\nwe're actually using HTTPS with SSL,\n\n271\n00:17:29.074 --> 00:17:33.929\nso we really provide that\ntransportation encryption.\n\n272\n00:17:33.929 --> 00:17:37.850\nNow, the individual files where\nthose files are stored on\n\n273\n00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:42.732\nthe containers within the server itself\ncan be encrypted like I said even\n\n274\n00:17:42.732 --> 00:17:46.029\nprotecting against\nthe system admin if need be.\n\n275\n00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:48.769\nAnd this also allows selective wipe.\n\n276\n00:17:48.769 --> 00:17:53.549\nSo what that means is that the encryption\nkeys are actually stored there with\n\n277\n00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:55.574\nthat file and on the container.\n\n278\n00:17:55.574 --> 00:18:00.573\nSo if Ronnie leaves the company and\nhe's using his personal device\n\n279\n00:18:00.573 --> 00:18:05.213\nwith the work information on it,\nI can delete those work files\n\n280\n00:18:05.213 --> 00:18:09.871\nwithout interfering with\nRonnie's personal information.\n\n281\n00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:13.417\nAnd again, like I just mentioned,\nyou can enable the password and\n\n282\n00:18:13.417 --> 00:18:17.615\ndevice lock policies and you have the\nability to limit to registered devices.\n\n283\n00:18:17.615 --> 00:18:20.554\nIf you utilize\nActive Directory Rights Management,\n\n284\n00:18:20.554 --> 00:18:22.979\nthen you're able to utilize this feature.\n\n285\n00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:27.008\nAnd then there's also integrated\ndata leak prevention.\n\n286\n00:18:27.008 --> 00:18:29.407\nSo when you look at 70-412,\n\n287\n00:18:29.407 --> 00:18:34.708\nyou'll learn about things like file\nclassification infrastructure where\n\n288\n00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:39.852\nyou're adding tag attributes to set\ntypes of mandatory access control.\n\n289\n00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:44.595\nSo I could say secret, top secret or\nwhatever your company may choose, and\n\n290\n00:18:44.595 --> 00:18:48.297\nI'm really setting a triage or\npriority for those files.\n\n291\n00:18:48.297 --> 00:18:52.661\nSo that's going to stay\nwith those files using RMS,\n\n292\n00:18:52.661 --> 00:18:57.434\nwhich is Active Directory\nRights Management Services.\n\n293\n00:18:57.434 --> 00:19:03.037\nSo even if that file moves from\none NTFS file structure to another\n\n294\n00:19:03.037 --> 00:19:07.914\nNTFS file structure even like\non a removable USB drive,\n\n295\n00:19:07.914 --> 00:19:11.261\nthat encryption stays with the file.\n\n296\n00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:12.547\nAnd lastly, of course,\n\n297\n00:19:12.547 --> 00:19:16.773\nyou're going to want to have anti malware\non the server just like you would with any\n\n298\n00:19:16.773 --> 00:19:20.655\nkind of situation here because that's\nobviously something to consider.\n\n299\n00:19:20.655 --> 00:19:24.648\nSo now that I've talked about it,\nI've no clue how long I've been talking.\n\n300\n00:19:24.648 --> 00:19:25.926\nAll right, we have ten minutes.\n\n301\n00:19:25.926 --> 00:19:27.434\nSo we can get started here.\n\n302\n00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:32.937\nLike I said, the setup here is a little\nlengthy, so just bear with me.\n\n303\n00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:35.943\nBut I promise once you get it all set up,\n\n304\n00:19:35.943 --> 00:19:39.864\nclient side literally takes\nless than a minute, so\n\n305\n00:19:39.864 --> 00:19:44.444\nit's definitely worth it to go ahead and\njust get started.\n\n306\n00:19:44.444 --> 00:19:47.996\nAnd what better place to\nstart than within PowerShell.\n\n307\n00:19:47.996 --> 00:19:52.873\nSo let me just full screen this and\nmake sure I'm connected.\n\n308\n00:19:52.873 --> 00:19:54.205\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\n\n309\n00:19:54.205 --> 00:19:57.481\nlet's make sure that we understand\nwhat you are going to do now.\n\n310\n00:19:57.481 --> 00:19:59.699\nSo we talked about the idea of the setup.\n\n311\n00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:04.203\nWhat's the first place that we need to\nmake sure that's on as we go and do this?\n\n312\n00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:07.641\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nset let me minimize PowerShell here.\n\n313\n00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:12.399\nThe first thing that I really need to\nmake sure has happened is that I had,\n\n314\n00:20:12.399 --> 00:20:13.728\nlet me just go back.\n\n315\n00:20:13.728 --> 00:20:16.468\nI got a little click happy, and\nhopefully I won't do that throughout.\n\n316\n00:20:16.468 --> 00:20:20.416\nFile and storage services, and\nI had spoke about this before.\n\n317\n00:20:20.416 --> 00:20:27.033\nSo this particular feature is installed\nautomatically with the operating system.\n\n318\n00:20:27.033 --> 00:20:30.173\nIf for some reason it's not here, then you\nwould definitely need to make sure that\n\n319\n00:20:30.173 --> 00:20:32.734\nthat is installed because that's\nwhat we're dealing with here.\n\n320\n00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:38.377\nSo this is going to be where we will\nstart here for that file server.\n\n321\n00:20:38.377 --> 00:20:41.918\nSo let me just pull up PowerShell and\nchange again.\n\n322\n00:20:41.918 --> 00:20:43.195\nI've always gotta do this.\n\n323\n00:20:43.195 --> 00:20:44.635\nIt'd be great.\n\n324\n00:20:44.635 --> 00:20:50.150\n[LAUGH] If I had it set up, but\nwe don't today or in this environment.\n\n325\n00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.377\nAll right, so the first thing we're\ngoing to do is install certification\n\n326\n00:20:54.377 --> 00:20:58.266\nauthority and then also certification\nauthority web enrollment as\n\n327\n00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:02.174\nwell as those administrative tools\nthat are associated with that.\n\n328\n00:21:02.174 --> 00:21:07.398\nSo if we think about\nthe design of this technology.\n\n329\n00:21:07.398 --> 00:21:09.151\nWe're gonna be using SSL.\n\n330\n00:21:09.151 --> 00:21:11.264\nWe're gonna be connecting via URL.\n\n331\n00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:12.541\nSo what does that tells us here?\n\n332\n00:21:12.541 --> 00:21:14.504\nSo we gonna need an Internet connection.\n\n333\n00:21:14.504 --> 00:21:18.467\nWe're going to need a web\nserver to connect, and\n\n334\n00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:24.477\nwe're also gonna need certificates\nto prevent any kind of rogue server.\n\n335\n00:21:24.477 --> 00:21:28.507\nAnd I mean that would be\na horrible situation, Ronnie,\n\n336\n00:21:28.507 --> 00:21:33.737\nif we had a rogue storage file and\nstorage server, a work folder server,\n\n337\n00:21:33.737 --> 00:21:38.916\nsitting there and you're syncing\nall of your documents to it, right?\n\n338\n00:21:38.916 --> 00:21:43.128\nSo that's why we would want to\nutilize those certificates just to\n\n339\n00:21:43.128 --> 00:21:46.510\nmake sure that security is\nthere from the end to end.\n\n340\n00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:50.114\nAnd that's really what they had in\nmind here because that is a potential\n\n341\n00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:51.084\na weakness there.\n\n342\n00:21:51.084 --> 00:21:52.910\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n343\n00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:58.398\nfirst we will be installing our\nADCS certification authority.\n\n344\n00:21:58.398 --> 00:22:03.288\nSo let's hit Add-Windows.\n\n345\n00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:08.007\nAnd this is going to be our feature for\nADCS, so\n\n346\n00:22:08.007 --> 00:22:14.422\nthis is that active directory\ncertification authority here.\n\n347\n00:22:14.422 --> 00:22:22.480\nSo let's just do a dash, certs.\n\n348\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.691\nJust making sure I've got\nthe right syntax here.\n\n349\n00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:26.503\nThat's always fun.\n\n350\n00:22:26.503 --> 00:22:28.512\nAnd this is going to be authority.\n\n351\n00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:32.542\nLet me just.\n\n352\n00:22:34.794 --> 00:22:39.869\nAll right, so\nactive directory certification authority,\n\n353\n00:22:39.869 --> 00:22:43.060\nand let's go ahead and also add ADCS.\n\n354\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.393\nThis is gonna be our web enrollment here.\n\n355\n00:22:45.393 --> 00:22:47.670\nSo web-enrollment.\n\n356\n00:22:50.514 --> 00:22:58.733\nAnd we will add the [INAUDIBLE] with\nthe include those management tools.\n\n357\n00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:05.599\nThis shouldn't take too long here and\n\n358\n00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:08.506\nwe'll make sure that those\nfeatures are installed.\n\n359\n00:23:08.506 --> 00:23:14.160\nWe will need to perform some post\ninstallation configurations.\n\n360\n00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.942\nAs a matter of fact, if I switch over\nto our server manage, we can wait for\n\n361\n00:23:17.942 --> 00:23:20.980\nthat and then see if there's\nany kind of notifications and\n\n362\n00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.206\nwe'll switch back into PowerShell\nto complete that as well.\n\n363\n00:23:27.932 --> 00:23:30.986\nOkay, and\nyou can see that that just happened here.\n\n364\n00:23:30.986 --> 00:23:31.758\nWe see that red.\n\n365\n00:23:31.758 --> 00:23:33.128\nIt's actually behind my head here.\n\n366\n00:23:33.128 --> 00:23:35.799\nSo it's red like alert, danger.\n\n367\n00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:37.459\nWe need to go ahead and configure that.\n\n368\n00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:38.910\nSo that's what we'll do right now.\n\n369\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.612\nSo let's just switch back over\nthe PowerShell to get that happening.\n\n370\n00:23:42.612 --> 00:23:43.714\nSorry.\nThere we go and\n\n371\n00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:46.643\nwe also get a notification here,\nwarning Windows.\n\n372\n00:23:46.643 --> 00:23:50.501\nOkay, this is just saying my\nautomatic updates is enabled.\n\n373\n00:23:50.501 --> 00:23:51.175\nThat's fine.\n\n374\n00:23:51.175 --> 00:23:52.638\nI don't need to worry about that.\n\n375\n00:23:52.638 --> 00:23:56.794\nSo that actual warning is not associated\nwith our post configuration there.\n\n376\n00:23:56.794 --> 00:23:59.685\nSo the next thing I need to do is install.\n\n377\n00:24:01.957 --> 00:24:06.697\nThis is going to be ADCS\ncertification authority.\n\n378\n00:24:15.964 --> 00:24:19.487\nAnd let's see,\nthis is going to be our CAType.\n\n379\n00:24:22.173 --> 00:24:24.339\nIt's going to be EnterpriseRouteCA.\n\n380\n00:24:31.194 --> 00:24:32.720\nAnd that's it.\n\n381\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.030\nWe also need to install our\nActive Directory services web enrollment,\n\n382\n00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.830\nso let's do that as well.\n\n383\n00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.730\nOkay, so this is just saying are you\nsure you want to perform this action?\n\n384\n00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.400\nWe'll hit Yes, and Enter.\n\n385\n00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.254\nAnd this is what you're looking for\nhere, is that ErrorId.\n\n386\n00:24:48.254 --> 00:24:50.029\nYou want to make sure that there's a 0 so\n\n387\n00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:53.070\nthat you know you didn't have any\nerrors during that installation.\n\n388\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.074\nThe next thing is going to be Install,\nnext cmdlet I should say.\n\n389\n00:25:00.074 --> 00:25:07.310\nAdcs, and this is going to be our-\n&gt;&gt; WebEnrollment.\n\n390\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.447\n&gt;&gt; WebEnrollment, all right.\n\n391\n00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:11.880\nNo spaces.\n\n392\n00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.870\n&gt;&gt; No spaces.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No spaces, all right.\n\n393\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.350\nAnd again we get that prompt,\ndo we wanna continue?\n\n394\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.040\nI'm gonna hit Yes, and hit Enter.\n\n395\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.650\nAnd again, ErrorId here is 0.\n\n396\n00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.890\nAnd let me just clear my screen so\nwe're up at the top here.\n\n397\n00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.760\nI think that's actually it for\nPowerShell right now.\n\n398\n00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.200\nYeah, let's switch over to our Server\nManager to see that notification here.\n\n399\n00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.020\nSo first of all, we do see that Active\nDirectory Certificate Services is now\n\n400\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.430\ninstalled as well.\n\n401\n00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.250\nWe do have our little notification.\n\n402\n00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.230\nBut that's okay,\nwe're gonna take care of that.\n\n403\n00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.780\nChecking on the time here,\nI think we might wanna save that for\n\n404\n00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:54.530\nthe next show though, before we really\nget into the meat and potatoes, Ronnie.\n\n405\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that sounds good.\n\n406\n00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.060\nThank you Cherokee for\n\n407\n00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:02.140\nhelping us to understand the usage of work\nfolders in the situation that we're in.\n\n408\n00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.410\nRemember to take a look at\nthis concept slowly here.\n\n409\n00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.870\nIt is easy to confuse this with\nsomething like offline folders and\n\n410\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.540\nwonder why we're actually doing it.\n\n411\n00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.320\nBut this is a big part of the exam as\nwell, to take a look at those options.\n\n412\n00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.700\nRemember that everything\nwe're showing you right,\n\n413\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.020\nyou always have to think about it in\nscenario terms when facing the exam.\n\n414\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.930\nAlways remember the key term there also,\n\n415\n00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.440\nis gonna be least\nadministrative effort as well.\n\n416\n00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.520\nAnd Cherokee is showing some of that,\nespecially in the realm of PowerShell too.\n\n417\n00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.040\nSo there's a lot of options to come but\n\n418\n00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.080\nCherokee has just set up the basics\nof the certification authority.\n\n419\n00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.580\nAnd the ability of course to enroll for\ncertificates too and\n\n420\n00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.590\nwe've got a lot more to see but\nwe're gonna save that for another part.\n\n421\n00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.820\nSo great place for us to end this episode.\n\n422\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.308\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n423\n00:26:47.308 --> 00:26:48.530\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n424\n00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:53.766\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410

00:00:08.270\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.230\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.405\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:17.355\nYou're watching the MCSA for\n\n7\n00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:21.961\nWindows Server 2012 R2 Specifically\non the exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:26.531\nWe're diving into of course more of\nthe configuring file and share access and\n\n9\n00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:29.910\nhere to help us today is\ngonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.040\nCherokee, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.730\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Ronnie,\nhow are you today?\n\n12\n00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.940\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n13\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.783\nNow Cherokee we've already done\na little bit of what we've talked\n\n14\n00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:38.772\nabout as far as some of\nthe different methods.\n\n15\n00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.276\nBut we're about to dive into something\nthat's a little bit more complicated here,\n\n16\n00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:42.590\nwhat are we taking a look at?\n\n17\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Ronnie, we've talked about\ndifferent types of ways we can\n\n18\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.730\naccess shares and\nwe can work with offline files.\n\n19\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.465\nBut today in this show,\nI wanted to set up work folders, and\n\n20\n00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.015\nwe've talked about work folders already.\n\n21\n00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:59.532\nWe actually even started doing a couple of\ncommands in PowerShell to get that set up\n\n22\n00:00:59.532 --> 00:01:00.387\nkick started.\n\n23\n00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:02.803\nBut I kinda just wanted\nto start from fresh and\n\n24\n00:01:02.803 --> 00:01:07.207\nmake sure that we're on the same page and\njust you know had a good solid start here.\n\n25\n00:01:07.207 --> 00:01:12.194\nAnd I wanted to also kind of show a\ndiagram to recap exactly what we're going\n\n26\n00:01:12.194 --> 00:01:15.200\nto be doing because there\nare a lot of steps and\n\n27\n00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.750\nit might be a little confusing to use.\n\n28\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.280\nSo I wanna make sure you understand why\nwe're doing it and why we're switching\n\n29\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.240\nbetween machines, so that it just makes\nsense from an overview perspective here.\n\n30\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330\nSo if we could take a look at my screen,\n\n31\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.320\nthis is the same diagram\nthat you saw before.\n\n32\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.160\nBut I did change a few things,\n\n33\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.680\nbecause we will We will be using practice\nlabs as our platform to set this up today.\n\n34\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.480\nSo the domain changes\nbefore I had ITPro Demo,\n\n35\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.320\nwhich was my lab that I\nhave running in my VMware.\n\n36\n00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.950\nBut we're gonna be using their lab.\n\n37\n00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.585\nSo the domain is practicelabs.com.\n\n38\n00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:56.564\nAnd predominantly, the two machines that\nwe'll be working with here are going\n\n39\n00:01:56.564 --> 00:02:00.290\nto be our domain controller\nwhich is PLABDC01 down here.\n\n40\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.910\nAnd our domain controller,\nwe had installed this three PowerShell\n\n41\n00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.140\ncommandlets to get our certificate\nservices installed and configured there.\n\n42\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.030\nThe reason we need to have them\non a separate machine is the CA.\n\n43\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.990\nI don't know if you're familiar\nwith the way certificates work.\n\n44\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.300\nIf not that's okay, we have a lot of\nshows that cover certificates and\n\n45\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.830\nI would highly encourage\nyou to check those out.\n\n46\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.710\nBut your CA is going to be\nissuing you issuing as a you,\n\n47\n00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.600\nbut it could be issuing a user,\nor a computer here.\n\n48\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.424\nSo in our situation,\nthe CA is issuing our files server,\n\n49\n00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:42.953\nour work folder server, a certificate.\n\n50\n00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:47.346\nSo that when one of these end users\ngo to connect they can verify that\n\n51\n00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:51.350\nthese files server is in fact\nto a that server so as it is.\n\n52\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.940\nSo we don't have to worry any kind\nof wrong service in our environment.\n\n53\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.390\nSo that's why we're gonna be using\na client as well so be using a windows 8.1\n\n54\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.070\nclient and\nthe name of artwork file servers PLABDMO1.\n\n55\n00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.960\nJust so you understand,\nwhen we're switching back and\n\n56\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.970\nforth between machines,\nhow this layout really works here?\n\n57\n00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.600\nSo I think that's about it,\nlet's go ahead and get started.\n\n58\n00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.380\nWe're gonna start in\nour domain controller.\n\n59\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.070\nAnd I'm just gonna retype\nthese commandlets.\n\n60\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.350\nSo that if you're just starting\nnow you'll be good to go and\n\n61\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.620\nyou won't need to go\nback to the other show.\n\n62\n00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.530\nSo this is going to be my\ncertification authority.\n\n63\n00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.972\nSo the commandlet is Add-WindowsFeature,\n\n64\n00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:44.610\nAnd that's going to be\nADCS-CERT-AUTHORITY.\n\n65\n00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.150\nAnd just remember guys,\nRonnie kinda picks on me sometimes,\n\n66\n00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.280\ncapitalization, we're not talking\nabout being case sensitive here.\n\n67\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.920\nI just like to do that because even\nwhen you're taking the exam or\n\n68\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.970\nreading Microsoft books, they usually\nkeep it capitalized just to help\n\n69\n00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.370\nyou read through the commands and\nretain that information.\n\n70\n00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.270\nSo I like to type everything out and also\nstick with that capitalization scheme.\n\n71\n00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.930\nYou don't have to, that's just me\nbeing the way I am, so that's all.\n\n72\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.052\n&gt;&gt; What Cherokee is referring to is don't\nforget that in PowerShell you do have\n\n73\n00:04:19.052 --> 00:04:21.050\nthe ability to do the auto complete.\n\n74\n00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.210\nBut in this type of lab set up, I don't\nknow if that actually can be accomplished\n\n75\n00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.850\nin the way that we would normally do it.\n\n76\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.354\nSo Cherokee is actually using the labs\nthat you'll have access to even through\n\n77\n00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.071\nyour ITProTV subscription.\n\n78\n00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:35.888\nSo you may find out that the auto complete\ndoesn't work exactly the way that\n\n79\n00:04:35.888 --> 00:04:36.700\nyou want to.\n\n80\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.350\nSo learning how to actually type\neverything out is gonna be a good\n\n81\n00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.050\nthing for us.\n\n82\n00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.410\n&gt;&gt; It always helps me remember.\n\n83\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.470\nWell, [LAUGH] I won't say\nalways helps me remember.\n\n84\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.780\nBut it does help that process, that\nretention process, so that's why I do it.\n\n85\n00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.300\nBut yes, in a production environment and\n\n86\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.450\nlike when your boss is kinda breathing\ndown your throat or your neck.\n\n87\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.730\nI guess throat would be weird but\nthat would still be weird.\n\n88\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.576\nAnyways, isn't that your not at\ntime crunch out of tab this year or\n\n89\n00:05:00.576 --> 00:05:02.716\nout of complete is your friend, so.\n\n90\n00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:05.600\nAll right, let's go ahead and\nrun this installation command.\n\n91\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.751\nIt will take just a few moments, but\n\n92\n00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:12.932\none of the problems whenever you're typing\nout like this is the potential for typos.\n\n93\n00:05:12.932 --> 00:05:16.450\nLet's see, Add-WindowsFeature,\nthe role, role service,\n\n94\n00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.080\nour feature name is not valid,\nADC is I missed a dash there.\n\n95\n00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.960\nSo let's go ahead and\nadd between web and enrollment.\n\n96\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.355\nBut this also just helps you\nremember that because on the exam,\n\n97\n00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:30.603\nI remember sitting there looking at\nsome of those multiple choice questions.\n\n98\n00:05:30.603 --> 00:05:33.370\nAnd you're thinking,\nmultiple choice A, B, C, D.\n\n99\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.020\nBut no, it's like, A through H or\nJ or something like that.\n\n100\n00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.300\nSo, every slight little detail is\nvery important when it comes to that.\n\n101\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.980\nSo, what we're doing now is we're\ninstalling our certification authority.\n\n102\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.930\nIf I pull up power,\nour server manager here.\n\n103\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.710\nSo, actually it's not gonna show yet.\n\n104\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.750\nBut there will be some post configuration\nutilities that we need to do.\n\n105\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.190\nAnd we're gonna do it within PowerShell,\nand\n\n106\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.930\nthen we'll have to just refresh\nit in the server manager.\n\n107\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.480\nSo that server manager,\n\n108\n00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.780\njust give it a few seconds to let it\nacknowledge that we're configuring it.\n\n109\n00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.150\nWith those default configurations here in\n\n110\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.540\nthe command line interface\njust taking a few minutes.\n\n111\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.785\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee we've understand\nwhat the certification authorities for,\n\n112\n00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:19.090\nwhat the second part of the web\nenrollment, what's that one for?\n\n113\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's a good question Ronnie\nbecause of work folders does rely on that\n\n114\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.030\nURL to go ahead and access.\n\n115\n00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.510\nSo that's how, it's kind of funny\nwhen we have the end users connect,\n\n116\n00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.630\nwe have a couple different options.\n\n117\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.210\nThey can use their email address, which is\ngoing, we'll see how that relates to our\n\n118\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.890\nsecurity identifiers, and the different\nnames that we can set for that later.\n\n119\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.280\nBut the reason we asked for that email\naddress is, because it's easy for\n\n120\n00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.980\nthe end users to remember.\n\n121\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:50.120\nI could alternatively specify and\ngive a unique URL to that end user.\n\n122\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.960\nSo, because we're using HTTPS protocol,\n\n123\n00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.540\nwe need to set up\nan internal web server here.\n\n124\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.900\nBut the thing is, we're not really\nsetting up a full-blown IIS server,\n\n125\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.090\nwe're just using core components.\n\n126\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.988\nSo we'll have to be using\nthe command line interface,\n\n127\n00:07:05.988 --> 00:07:09.021\nwe can't do that through\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n128\n00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.998\nAll right, so\nit looks like we got that installed.\n\n129\n00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:15.941\nSo we just need to perform a configuration\nhere, and it's kinda funny.\n\n130\n00:07:15.941 --> 00:07:23.134\nThe commandlet is install and that's going\nto be -adcs certification authority,\n\n131\n00:07:27.255 --> 00:07:30.376\nAnd we need to specify the CA type.\n\n132\n00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:35.129\nHere it is going to be\nenterprise group CA,\n\n133\n00:07:39.353 --> 00:07:41.680\nWe'll hit enter, give it a second here.\n\n134\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.000\nWe're really looking for an error ID of 0,\nso that's what I want to happen.\n\n135\n00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.370\nFirst it's just alerting me hey, do you\nwant to go ahead and perform this action?\n\n136\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.190\nYes, yes I do.\n\n137\n00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.033\nAll right, here is that error id that\nI'm looking for but that's not it.\n\n138\n00:07:56.033 --> 00:08:00.062\nThat particular component for the web\nenrollment that Ronnie had asked about we\n\n139\n00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:01.815\nalso need to set that up as well so.\n\n140\n00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.644\nLet's do that.\n\n141\n00:08:03.644 --> 00:08:07.596\nAnd that'll be install-adcs, and\n\n142\n00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:12.700\nthis is going to be webenrollment,\nno spaces.\n\n143\n00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.620\n&gt;&gt; Now, you might be wondering to yourself\nwhy is Cherokee taking time to do all of\n\n144\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.220\nthis in PowerShell when you know that\nthere's a perfectly good, what is it,\n\n145\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.860\nthe install wizards that\nare actually there.\n\n146\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.840\nThat you might go,\nI know I've seen these options before and\n\n147\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.850\nI can just install them from there.\n\n148\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:31.890\nWhy is Cherokee doing this?\n\n149\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.600\nSo Cherokee, remind us again why\nyou're doing the PowerShell?\n\n150\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.720\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft loves PowerShell,\n\n151\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.550\nRonnie, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n152\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.540\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much it.\n\n153\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.970\n&gt;&gt; So I wanna make sure you\nguys know how to use it.\n\n154\n00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.846\nIt's a little bit easier, in my opinion\nto navigate through the user interface.\n\n155\n00:08:45.846 --> 00:08:51.071\nSo any kind of help that I can give you,\nthen I'm all for that.\n\n156\n00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:55.076\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea, right, is kinda clear\n\n157\n00:08:55.076 --> 00:09:01.450\nhere with the MCSA and as you go into\nthe future towards everything else, right?\n\n158\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.170\nMicrosoft is gonna be testing very\nheavily in the ID of PowerShell,\n\n159\n00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.180\nunderstanding the installing and\n\n160\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.360\ndoing all this even via PowerShell is\ngoing to actually be helpful for you.\n\n161\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.793\nSo don't overlook it, don't gloss over\nit because you'll probably see more\n\n162\n00:09:16.793 --> 00:09:19.156\nquestions on it than using that instead.\n\n163\n00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:23.929\nSo Cherokee, what we've essentially just\nset up is the certificate authority and\n\n164\n00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:27.950\na process in the way that we can now\nenroll to get a certificate from that\n\n165\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.740\ncertificate authority.\n\n166\n00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.820\nAnything else that you did\nright there in Powershell?\n\n167\n00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.400\n&gt;&gt; I just cleared the screen and\nexited while you were talking.\n\n168\n00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.800\nBecause we're now going to be hopping\ninto server manager to perform those\n\n169\n00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.010\nadditional configurations.\n\n170\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.760\nWe're actually gonna be using\ncertification authority that we just\n\n171\n00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.280\ninstalled to duplicate a template.\n\n172\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.990\nSo, if we take a look at my screen,\nI'll show you how we can do that.\n\n173\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.010\nOver on the right hand side under Tools,\nand\n\n174\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.720\nit's kind of interesting we're not\nable to generate a brand new template.\n\n175\n00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.210\nSo we're gonna copy the web server\ntemplate that's all ready there and\n\n176\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.617\njust kind of make it our own.\n\n177\n00:10:03.617 --> 00:10:08.450\nBut in order to access that we can now use\nour brand new utility right here that says\n\n178\n00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.170\ncertification authority.\n\n179\n00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.570\nAnd that's what we've just installed.\n\n180\n00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:16.020\nSo let's launch that and give it a second,\nlet me zoom out so we can\n\n181\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.340\nmanipulate the page to give us enough\nroom and see everything that's happening.\n\n182\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:27.910\nNow, over here on the left hand side\nI have a repository for my individual\n\n183\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:33.680\ncertificates and you can see there's a\nfolder here called certificate templates.\n\n184\n00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.420\nSo whenever I click on this\nit should propagate and\n\n185\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.964\nfold them in that center pane, but\nwhat I wanna do here is I'm going to be\n\n186\n00:10:39.964 --> 00:10:45.350\nright-clicking on top of Certificate\nTemplates and selecting Manage.\n\n187\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.470\nAll right, and I'll just zoom out here.\n\n188\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:50.977\nWhat we're looking for\n\n189\n00:10:50.977 --> 00:10:54.981\nis going to be our default web\nserver template that's in here.\n\n190\n00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:59.254\nAnd that's the one we're going\nto use as our boilerplate.\n\n191\n00:10:59.254 --> 00:11:04.350\nIf you guys haven't heard that term,\nit just simply means that's the shell.\n\n192\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.250\nAnd we're gonna use that\nas a generic template here.\n\n193\n00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.830\nAnd in order to do that, you simply\nright-click on top of that template,\n\n194\n00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.800\nthat web server template, and\nthen select duplicate template.\n\n195\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.368\nThat will pull up our properties tab here.\n\n196\n00:11:18.368 --> 00:11:20.492\nA couple things we'll want to modify here.\n\n197\n00:11:20.492 --> 00:11:23.590\nNumber one,\nwe definitely need to change the name.\n\n198\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.090\nAs a matter of fact,\nyou can't have the exact same names.\n\n199\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.690\nThat's why they go ahead and\nput copy of right there.\n\n200\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.170\nBut we're just going\nto change this to SSL.\n\n201\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:37.080\nNow, because we're using, and remember\nwhen we talked about how Microsoft wants\n\n202\n00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.420\nto incorporate security into this process,\nSSL, secure socket layers,\n\n203\n00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.800\nis going to provide that for us.\n\n204\n00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.920\nSo we're just specifying hey,\n\n205\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.600\nwe're using SSL to make that\nprotocol suite for https here.\n\n206\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.860\nThe next thing I want to do is just\nverify that the tab that I selected here\n\n207\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.140\nis going to be the subject name, because\nwe are gonna be requesting subject names.\n\n208\n00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.690\nLike I said, you'll see how the whole\nnaming convention plays out here and\n\n209\n00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.190\nthe different types of names\nthat we will choose to use.\n\n210\n00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.620\nAlso under security I do need\nto verify that my authenticated\n\n211\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.930\nusers here have some credentials.\n\n212\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.760\nAnd I want to just verify that they have\nthe ability to enroll in this process.\n\n213\n00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.460\nSo let’s make sure that is selected and\nwe'll hit OK.\n\n214\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.910\nAnd we should be good to go there.\n\n215\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.730\nThe next thing I wanna do is\nactually issue the allow this\n\n216\n00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.890\nparticular certificate template to\nhave some kind of issuance available.\n\n217\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:38.580\nSo what I'm gonna do here is\nclose out of this window,\n\n218\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.170\nthe Certificate Templates Console window\nbut this'll bring us back to that\n\n219\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.750\nprevious window and let me zoom in so\nyou can see the title.\n\n220\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.460\nIt's located in this horizontal\nblue bar here where it says\n\n221\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.990\nserver certification authority local.\n\n222\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.820\nSo this is where we want to be to go\nahead and create that issuance request.\n\n223\n00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.560\nAll right.\n\n224\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.760\nAnd in order to do that, I left click.\n\n225\n00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.590\nMake sure certificate template\nis highlighted in blue there and\n\n226\n00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.230\nyou can right-click and\nselect new and then I'm selecting\n\n227\n00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.740\ncertificate template to issue and\nthat's what I want to have right here.\n\n228\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.900\nGive me a second and\nwe're gonna be asking, requesting.\n\n229\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.630\nTo issue the certificate\nthat we just created.\n\n230\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Cherokee, I noticed that\nwhen you selected the security tab for\n\n231\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:30.390\nthat particular template,\nyou selected authenticated users and\n\n232\n00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.650\nyou allowed authenticated users to enroll.\n\n233\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.140\nNow, you may actually be wondering if\nyou're one of those security guys saying,\n\n234\n00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.320\nhey that's not really\nthe principle of lease privilege.\n\n235\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.530\nWell, if you are actually setting this up\non your own, you may choose to do a manual\n\n236\n00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.400\ntype of enrollment for\nyour particular server that you're doing.\n\n237\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.130\nHere in the lab environment,\nCherokee has selected authenticated users.\n\n238\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.590\nAnd remember that includes, of course,\ndomain computers and domain users.\n\n239\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.710\nSo this way,\n\n240\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.140\nher server that she's gonna be connecting\nto it doesn't have to do any interaction.\n\n241\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.330\nIt allows that particular server to\nalso go ahead and request that and\n\n242\n00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.610\nbe able to get connected.\n\n243\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.590\nBut if you do have any questions\nabout that from someone who goes,\n\n244\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.060\nhey, should I do authenticated users or\nnot?\n\n245\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.310\nIt's not a choice of right or wrong.\n\n246\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.380\nIt depends on whatever your security\npolicy is gonna be for your organization.\n\n247\n00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.970\nSo if this looks a little bit\nstrange to you, that's why.\n\n248\n00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.750\nWe're just trying to set this up for\nthe lab so\n\n249\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:27.730\nit can almost do an auto type of\nenrollment, although technically it's not.\n\n250\n00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie.\n\n251\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.960\nSo if we take a look\nback at my screen here,\n\n252\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.880\nwhat I wanted to do was pick back\nup with that configuration here.\n\n253\n00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.890\nSo this is where we will select that\nSSL template that we just created.\n\n254\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.890\nLet me scroll down and\nmake sure that it's actually here.\n\n255\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.720\nThere we go.\n\n256\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.730\nSSL web server, we'll hit okay.\n\n257\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.280\nIf I zoom out here we do see that it's\nnow listed here in that available list.\n\n258\n00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.180\nSo that's what you just want to\nverify to make sure that everything\n\n259\n00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.180\nwent well in this particular step.\n\n260\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.200\nNow the next thing we need\nto do is set up a name.\n\n261\n00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.080\nIf you are not too\nfamiliar with DNS I would\n\n262\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.190\nsuggest taking a look at\nsome of our DNS shows.\n\n263\n00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:18.820\nMicrosoft loves DNS, it's a core network\nfeature, so it's kind of implied\n\n264\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.290\nthat you understand what records are at\nthis point in time, resource records.\n\n265\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.500\nBut I will also cover DNS in depth\nif you don't, so that's fine, too.\n\n266\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.280\nYou may just need to come back maybe and\n\n267\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.330\nrewatch this part or other parts once\nyou have a good understanding of DNS.\n\n268\n00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.690\nAs well as DHCP, too, so\nsome of these core network protocols and\n\n269\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.950\nprocesses you really need to\nunderstand to get a full picture here.\n\n270\n00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.811\nBut what we're gonna do is launch our\nDNS Management console under Tools,\n\n271\n00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:52.535\nand I'll just expand that out a little\nbit so we can see what's going on.\n\n272\n00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:57.349\nOn the left-hand side,\nI have my PLABDC01 DNS serverr.\n\n273\n00:15:57.349 --> 00:16:01.691\nI'm going to expand it out\nI'm also going to expand out.\n\n274\n00:16:01.691 --> 00:16:04.036\nI see my different zones\nthat are located there.\n\n275\n00:16:04.036 --> 00:16:06.823\nI'm gonna expand out my\nforward look up zones.\n\n276\n00:16:06.823 --> 00:16:11.550\nAnd then I'll click on top\nof my practicelabs.com zone.\n\n277\n00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.815\nWhenever I right-click, well first of all,\n\n278\n00:16:13.815 --> 00:16:16.845\nwe see some particular records\nthat are already listed here.\n\n279\n00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:19.415\nI didn't create them,\nthis is part of that lab environment.\n\n280\n00:16:19.415 --> 00:16:23.845\nThese are going to be at my different\nmachines, I have a couple client machines,\n\n281\n00:16:23.845 --> 00:16:29.985\nPLAB Win 701, and our Windows 8.1\nmachine with our A records here.\n\n282\n00:16:29.985 --> 00:16:34.913\nRemember A record is just\ngoing to be that host name to\n\n283\n00:16:34.913 --> 00:16:38.053\nIP version 4 resolution there.\n\n284\n00:16:38.053 --> 00:16:41.885\nWe're going to be creating our CNAME,\nour canonical name, so\n\n285\n00:16:41.885 --> 00:16:45.370\njust right click on top of that zone and\nselect New Alias.\n\n286\n00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.400\nAnd then they have CNAME listed here.\n\n287\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.189\nAnd, the name for\nour alias is going to be workfolders.\n\n288\n00:16:56.489 --> 00:17:01.031\nYou'll see that the fully qualified domain\nname gets automatically filled in here,\n\n289\n00:17:01.031 --> 00:17:04.121\nbut we'll need to specify this\nthird portion right here,\n\n290\n00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:07.220\nbecause this is actually\ngoing to be the target host.\n\n291\n00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.170\nSo this is our practice\nlabs DMO 1 machine,\n\n292\n00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:14.170\nso let's go ahead and type that in,\nplabdm01.practicelabs.com,\n\n293\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:19.750\nand let me check my spelling.\n\n294\n00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.678\nWhen you're going through this process,\nits very critical, especially when we're\n\n295\n00:17:24.678 --> 00:17:28.603\ndealing with our certificates,\none little typo will ruin your day.\n\n296\n00:17:28.603 --> 00:17:33.486\nSo, Ronnie, you might wanna keep an eye\nout for me there, but for now, looks good.\n\n297\n00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.506\nSo we'll hit OK, and\nwe should see right there,\n\n298\n00:17:36.506 --> 00:17:40.302\nthat's where our new resource\nrecord has been filled in.\n\n299\n00:17:40.302 --> 00:17:43.770\nOur workfolders alias, so\nwe're good to go there.\n\n300\n00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.072\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nlet's make sure, just in case,\n\n301\n00:17:46.072 --> 00:17:49.160\nsomebody really doesn't have a great\nunderstanding and background.\n\n302\n00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.066\nWhat we're saying is now we can be able\nto find this computer we're gonna do\n\n303\n00:17:53.066 --> 00:17:57.220\nworkfolders on, by typing in workfolders\nin nodes that it's actually gonna be\n\n304\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.968\nlinked to, a physical machine.\n\n305\n00:17:58.968 --> 00:18:01.074\nThat's the-\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this one right here, labdm01.\n\n306\n00:18:01.074 --> 00:18:02.730\n&gt;&gt; Plabdmo01.\n\n307\n00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.843\nSo if you're like, what the heck is that?\n\n308\n00:18:04.843 --> 00:18:07.184\nThat's all we're doing,\nis saying we can use the name.\n\n309\n00:18:07.184 --> 00:18:10.590\nIf not, Cherokee would have to use\nall IP addresses all the time, and\n\n310\n00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.430\nthat's probably not gonna work for\nmost people inside of our organization.\n\n311\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.391\n&gt;&gt; Right and all those clients, those\ndifferent devices, our mobile phones and\n\n312\n00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:22.534\neverything, so all those individual\nclients' machines are gonna easily be able\n\n313\n00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:25.314\nto find that server that's\nhousing our workfolders.\n\n314\n00:18:25.314 --> 00:18:28.870\nThat file server that is housing the data,\nso that's why we did that.\n\n315\n00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:36.393\nAnd the next thing we need to do is go\ninto Group Policy Management Editor.\n\n316\n00:18:36.393 --> 00:18:42.720\nNow this step is something that, let me\njust pull up this diagram here again.\n\n317\n00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.466\nI had a firewall listed or\ndisplayed right here.\n\n318\n00:18:46.466 --> 00:18:50.047\nAnd I should have actually changed this\nto reflect like another server here,\n\n319\n00:18:50.047 --> 00:18:54.320\nbecause the way that practice labs has\nit set up, they're using a proxy server.\n\n320\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.460\nProxy servers work well\nwith this environment,\n\n321\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.165\nyou can use a firewall here and and/or,\nwell, you should always have your\n\n322\n00:19:01.165 --> 00:19:04.845\nfirewall, but you can also use\na proxy server in this configuration.\n\n323\n00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:05.975\nSo that's what we're going to do.\n\n324\n00:19:05.975 --> 00:19:08.165\nIt's not something that's required, but\n\n325\n00:19:08.165 --> 00:19:10.885\nthe way that our labs are configured,\nwe do need to address that.\n\n326\n00:19:10.885 --> 00:19:14.127\nSo I just wanted to make\nsure you were aware of that.\n\n327\n00:19:14.127 --> 00:19:18.141\nAll right, so let me make sure I\nam still in the correct machine.\n\n328\n00:19:18.141 --> 00:19:20.806\nI'm on DC01, so under Tools,\n\n329\n00:19:20.806 --> 00:19:25.854\nwe have our Group Policy Management,\nand let me show you that,\n\n330\n00:19:25.854 --> 00:19:31.209\nit's right over here, and\nwe're just gonna pull up that editor.\n\n331\n00:19:31.209 --> 00:19:32.000\nI'll zoom out.\n\n332\n00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.369\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee as we're doing this,\nhopefully at home,\n\n333\n00:19:34.369 --> 00:19:37.198\nif you're doing the same thing,\nyou'll have to set this up, but\n\n334\n00:19:37.198 --> 00:19:40.765\nif you're not using a proxy server, is\nthis something we'd still have to set up?\n\n335\n00:19:40.765 --> 00:19:43.657\n&gt;&gt; If you're not using a proxy server,\nno, you can skip this step right here.\n\n336\n00:19:43.657 --> 00:19:44.364\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n337\n00:19:44.364 --> 00:19:50.090\n&gt;&gt; On the left hand side,\nI've just expanded out my forest.\n\n338\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.709\nSo this is the little symbol for\nmy forest.\n\n339\n00:19:51.709 --> 00:19:56.562\nAnd remember your forest is\nthe overall encapsulating,\n\n340\n00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:59.570\nlogical boundary of your domain.\n\n341\n00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.870\nSo if you're like, I never created\na forest, well when you create your domain\n\n342\n00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:08.050\nyou natively create a forest, and\nwe're only dealing with one forest here.\n\n343\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.052\nSo we are gonna go ahead and\nexpand that out and expand out our domain.\n\n344\n00:20:12.052 --> 00:20:15.621\nWe only have our one domain here,\nthis is practicelabs.com.\n\n345\n00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:18.380\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nexpand that out.\n\n346\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.996\nAnd we're gonna be modifying\nour default domain policy here.\n\n347\n00:20:20.996 --> 00:20:22.416\nSo let's go ahead and click that.\n\n348\n00:20:22.416 --> 00:20:27.128\nI get a notification that's just saying,\nhey this is your default domain policy,\n\n349\n00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:30.765\nare you sure you wanna select\na group policy object that's gonna\n\n350\n00:20:30.765 --> 00:20:35.620\nbe pushed out globally here, to all other\nlocations where this GPO is linked.\n\n351\n00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.860\nThat's exactly what we want to do,\nwe wanna affect those other machines\n\n352\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.320\nin our domain, so\nI'm gonna just check this box.\n\n353\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.500\nWe don't have to see that message pop\nup every time if we continue to edit.\n\n354\n00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.340\nBut we really should just\nhave to edit once here, and\n\n355\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.610\nwe do that by right clicking and\nthen selecting Edit.\n\n356\n00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.920\nNow, when we're in Group Policy Management\nEditor over on your left hand side,\n\n357\n00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.750\nnow yours might be kind of\nthe arrow's looking like this and\n\n358\n00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.940\nyou just have to push them out\nto kind of pull everything out.\n\n359\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.060\nWell, the one you wanna be looking for\nis underneath User Configuration, and\n\n360\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.630\nwe're gonna be modifying the Preferences.\n\n361\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.740\nWe do have two options here,\nPolicies is going to be required.\n\n362\n00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.210\nPreferences is like the name implies,\nit's just a preference, but\n\n363\n00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.090\nthat's what we'll be configuring and\nsetting up here.\n\n364\n00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:30.890\nBecause we're using that web base\ncommunication, we'll need to\n\n365\n00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:36.140\nclick on Control Panel Settings here and\nconfigure that via Internet Explorer.\n\n366\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.930\nSo once you left-click,\nthere's a couple different ways,\n\n367\n00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.770\nyou could even expand this out and\nyou have the exact same options here.\n\n368\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.050\nSo you could right-click either\nover on this left hand pane or\n\n369\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.400\nover here on this right side, as well.\n\n370\n00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.780\nWhen you get on top of Internet Settings,\nright click, select New,\n\n371\n00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.600\nand we're going to be pulling\nup Internet Explorer 10.\n\n372\n00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.355\nOkay, and\nlet me zoom out a little bit so, too far.\n\n373\n00:22:00.355 --> 00:22:04.160\nAll right, I just want you guys\nto be able to see all the tabs.\n\n374\n00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.921\nIt's important that you see the tabs and\nknow which tab to click on, when you're\n\n375\n00:22:09.921 --> 00:22:15.191\nconfiguring these things, especially\nwhen it comes time for that exam.\n\n376\n00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:18.690\nNow, the first thing I want to do here,\na couple of different things.\n\n377\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:23.350\nI want to check over on the far right\ncorner, there's a Connections tab.\n\n378\n00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.889\nI need to modify my\nLocal Area Network settings.\n\n379\n00:22:25.889 --> 00:22:30.328\nSo click the LAN settings button,\nand this will bring me up to a new\n\n380\n00:22:30.328 --> 00:22:35.210\nwindow here where I can configure\nmy proxy server settings.\n\n381\n00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.090\nLet's make sure that this check box is,\nin fact, enabled and\n\n382\n00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.850\nwe're gonna specify the address and\nthat address is proxy.\n\n383\n00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:45.662\nSo, let's just type in proxy and\nthe default port number for\n\n384\n00:22:45.662 --> 00:22:47.469\nproxy servers is 8080.\n\n385\n00:22:47.469 --> 00:22:52.289\nNow that doesn't mean you can't have\na different port number in use, but\n\n386\n00:22:52.289 --> 00:22:56.504\nfor our situation,\nwe are using that default of 8080 here.\n\n387\n00:22:56.504 --> 00:23:02.160\nAnd we'll click this button that says\nBypass proxy server for local addresses.\n\n388\n00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.230\nWe need it to do a little bit more here.\n\n389\n00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:09.304\nWe'll hit this Advance button and\nwe need to specify a wild card,\n\n390\n00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:13.652\nby utilizing asterisks,\nthat's such a strange word.\n\n391\n00:23:13.652 --> 00:23:19.827\nAll right, so this is our wild card,\nso we'll type in *workfolders* and\n\n392\n00:23:19.827 --> 00:23:23.845\nthen we'll put another\none at the very end here,\n\n393\n00:23:23.845 --> 00:23:29.347\nthe reason we're doing this is to\nhelp allow that communication.\n\n394\n00:23:29.347 --> 00:23:34.298\nWe could have, in DNS,\nset up wild card DNS records,\n\n395\n00:23:34.298 --> 00:23:37.940\nbut that's just a little less secure.\n\n396\n00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.470\nSo that's why this configuration\nis gonna be chosen over the other.\n\n397\n00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.650\nIt's not that this is the only way you can\nset that up, but just letting you know.\n\n398\n00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.369\nWe are prompted with a bit\nof notification here.\n\n399\n00:23:48.369 --> 00:23:52.352\nThis is one of those things that just kind\nof make you wonder whenever they were\n\n400\n00:23:52.352 --> 00:23:55.002\ndesigning it,\nit's a little bit of a work around.\n\n401\n00:23:55.002 --> 00:23:58.487\nBut I'll walk you through this so\nyou don't have to go through that trouble.\n\n402\n00:23:58.487 --> 00:24:03.489\nIf you read carefully it says,\nproxy override values require that\n\n403\n00:24:03.489 --> 00:24:09.310\nthe bypass proxy server for local address\nalso be enabled on the next screen.\n\n404\n00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.136\nThat was at the previous screen.\n\n405\n00:24:12.136 --> 00:24:17.444\nSo, we'll hit OK, and we did enable it\non the screen But notice how I still\n\n406\n00:24:17.444 --> 00:24:22.940\nhave the red, so that configuration\ndidn't take in the operating system.\n\n407\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.182\nAnd because I'm working on a virtual\nmachine, Microsoft sometimes allows\n\n408\n00:24:27.182 --> 00:24:30.971\nfunction keys to be used to push\nthese configuration settings out.\n\n409\n00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:35.940\nI can't use my function keys from\nmy laptop to configure this.\n\n410\n00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:41.838\nSo one thing that I can do is to use\nthe integrated on screen keyboard.\n\n411\n00:24:41.838 --> 00:24:45.103\nSo if I just right-click on top\nof my Start button here and\n\n412\n00:24:45.103 --> 00:24:49.400\nselect Run, I'll type in osk and\nthis will bring up my on screen keyboard.\n\n413\n00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:58.590\nNow, you may get frustrated if you don't\nfollow this part step by step here.\n\n414\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:02.880\nSo you wanna make sure that this window\nis highlighted blue, because that's how\n\n415\n00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.260\nthe keyboard knows where I'm sending\nthese function key commands.\n\n416\n00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.230\nThe second thing you're supposed to do\nis uncheck this bypass proxy server for\n\n417\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.130\nlocal address portion.\n\n418\n00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.827\nAnd then check it again, trust me,\nyou don't have to do that, but.\n\n419\n00:25:17.827 --> 00:25:21.031\n[LAUGH] Believe me, all right,\nI'm just saving you some time,\n\n420\n00:25:21.031 --> 00:25:24.190\nthen you're gonna go ahead and\nhit your function key.\n\n421\n00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:29.444\nYou'll hit F5 to refresh, and let's oops\nI didn't have it highlighted in blue.\n\n422\n00:25:29.444 --> 00:25:31.434\nYou definitely need that so\nyou can send that command,\n\n423\n00:25:31.434 --> 00:25:33.035\nyou'll see what I'm talking about.\n\n424\n00:25:33.035 --> 00:25:35.115\nBut now, those red lines, and\n\n425\n00:25:35.115 --> 00:25:37.655\nI can close out my keyboard,\nthat's all I needed that for.\n\n426\n00:25:37.655 --> 00:25:40.355\nIf I zoom in, you'll see that\n\n427\n00:25:40.355 --> 00:25:44.000\nthose function commands were pushed\ninto the actual operating system here.\n\n428\n00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.590\nSo, we should be good to go at that\npoint and time, I think that's it.\n\n429\n00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.710\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Cherokee let's make\nsure we understand what we did here,\n\n430\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:56.150\nbecause we went to the trouble of actually\ngetting this proxy and setting it up.\n\n431\n00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.088\nBut all that we're really\ndoing here right is that,\n\n432\n00:25:58.088 --> 00:26:00.611\nbecause what Cherokee was showing you,\nat the edge of the network.\n\n433\n00:26:00.611 --> 00:26:05.289\nAnd there's a proxy server, what she's\ndoing is making an exception for\n\n434\n00:26:05.289 --> 00:26:06.503\nher work folders.\n\n435\n00:26:06.503 --> 00:26:10.555\nSo, when she went to the advanced,\nand she typed in that asterisk\n\n436\n00:26:10.555 --> 00:26:14.913\nwork folders asterisk, saying\nanything that has the word asterisk.\n\n437\n00:26:14.913 --> 00:26:15.689\n&gt;&gt; Work folders.\n\n438\n00:26:15.689 --> 00:26:16.544\n&gt;&gt; Work folders.\n\n439\n00:26:16.544 --> 00:26:18.953\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anything that has the word work folders\n\n440\n00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:21.893\nin it, go ahead and\ndon't use the proxy server.\n\n441\n00:26:21.893 --> 00:26:24.662\nSo, everything else we still\nwanna use the proxy server.\n\n442\n00:26:24.662 --> 00:26:29.963\nBut if you're sending up work folders and\nyou are actually creating that,\n\n443\n00:26:29.963 --> 00:26:34.605\nit means and you have a proxy server,\nyou've got to by-pass it.\n\n444\n00:26:34.605 --> 00:26:36.421\nAnd that's what Cherokee\nis showing you here.\n\n445\n00:26:36.421 --> 00:26:41.024\nIt is very important that those red lines\ngo away, because it's easy to assume that\n\n446\n00:26:41.024 --> 00:26:45.658\njust because you typed it in and you click\nOK, or you click Apply, that it's done.\n\n447\n00:26:45.658 --> 00:26:48.540\nAnd then when it doesn't work and\nyou come back and go wait a minute,\n\n448\n00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.740\nI put those words in there, and\nit's just not working, well that's why.\n\n449\n00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.858\nSo, make sure you do pay attention\nat least to this setting,\n\n450\n00:26:54.858 --> 00:26:58.908\ncuz if not that means that for you to do\nwork folders it's gonna hit your proxy.\n\n451\n00:26:58.908 --> 00:27:00.193\nIt's never gonna get to the work folders.\n\n452\n00:27:00.193 --> 00:27:02.436\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and thanks for\njust noting that Ronnie,\n\n453\n00:27:02.436 --> 00:27:04.063\nbecause it is super important here.\n\n454\n00:27:04.063 --> 00:27:06.067\nAnd actually,\nI just wanted to back out and\n\n455\n00:27:06.067 --> 00:27:09.420\nshow you the last couple of things to do,\nand it's nothing major here.\n\n456\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.840\nAll we're doing is hitting those you know,\nbacking out of the Windows,\n\n457\n00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.238\nhitting okay and okay.\n\n458\n00:27:14.238 --> 00:27:17.105\nAnd I think that's about it for this show,\n\n459\n00:27:17.105 --> 00:27:20.860\nbecause that's a good point for\nus to go ahead and stop.\n\n460\n00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.800\nI've been mentioning this\nconcept of utilizing names.\n\n461\n00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.790\nBut I think in the next show,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n462\n00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.540\nbegin showing how we can set\nup those user principal names.\n\n463\n00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.580\nBecause Ronnie, remember not only\nare we enabling our domain joint\n\n464\n00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.930\nsystems to be able to\nconnect to work folders.\n\n465\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.511\nWe're also allowing non-domain,\nbecause you know people want to do work on\n\n466\n00:27:41.511 --> 00:27:45.320\nthe beach and in their home or\nwherever they are, I don't know.\n\n467\n00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.918\nBut we have that flexibility so,\nI think that'll be a good place for\n\n468\n00:27:47.918 --> 00:27:49.680\nus to come back and check out.\n\n469\n00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.860\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nsounds like a great idea Cherokee.\n\n470\n00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.290\nSo remember that in this episode you\ndid see Cherokee just go ahead and\n\n471\n00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:59.170\ngive us the setup of what we need to\nget started in making sure that we have\n\n472\n00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.350\nall of the different things in place for\n\n473\n00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:06.320\nwork folders to be able to work\nin the way that we want them to.\n\n474\n00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.968\nAnd getting this stuff set up and\n\n475\n00:28:07.968 --> 00:28:10.358\nunderstanding all\nthe little options there.\n\n476\n00:28:10.358 --> 00:28:13.570\nThey're gonna be important,\nespecially when it comes down to the exam.\n\n477\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.160\nSo make sure you pay attention right here,\nand the PowerShell commands.\n\n478\n00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.510\nAll these are actually elements\nthat's gonna be highly testable, so\n\n479\n00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.730\nmake sure you watch this\nepisode more than one time.\n\n480\n00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.585\nSo there's a lot more for\nus to go on work folders, but\n\n481\n00:28:26.585 --> 00:28:28.430\nthis is a great place for us to end.\n\n482\n00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:32.233\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n483\n00:28:32.233 --> 00:28:33.374\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n484\n00:28:33.374 --> 00:28:38.905\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n485\n00:28:38.905 --> 00:28:44.926\n[MUSIC]\n\n486\n00:28:44.926 --> 00:28:47.867\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.287\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.287 --> 00:00:12.264\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:14.766\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:19.310\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.550\nMore specifically covering exam 70-410 and\n\n8\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.430\nwe're jumping right into the middle\nof configuring work folders here.\n\n9\n00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.740\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n10\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.520\nhere to help us out is gonna\nbe of course Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.450\nCherokee welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.210\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.530\nSuper excited to go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.260\ncontinue with our work folders because\nwe've got a lot of work ahead of us.\n\n15\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.270\nSo I think we'll just dive right in.\n\n16\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.700\nThe first thing that I want to do is\npick right back up where we left off.\n\n17\n00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.630\nWe were going to set that user\nprincipal name for our administrator.\n\n18\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.920\nSo in order to do that,\nif you could join me in my screen,\n\n19\n00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.070\nwe're gonna be pulling up\nActive Directory users and computers.\n\n20\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.898\nSo I just have Server Manager\npulled up on my domain controller.\n\n21\n00:00:56.898 --> 00:00:59.890\nFrom the right-hand pane\ndrop down menu Tools and\n\n22\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.880\nthen select Active Directory Users and\nComputers.\n\n23\n00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.030\nFrom my Active Directory Users and\n\n24\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.530\nComputers window I wanna make sure I\nexpand out my users container here and\n\n25\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.270\nI'm looking for my administrator,\nall the way down at the bottom.\n\n26\n00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.480\nLet's right click and\nselect Properties My screen's a little,\n\n27\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.230\nI don't wanna go too far but there we go.\n\n28\n00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.380\nAll right, so\nonce we have our Properties pulled\n\n29\n00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.340\nup we need to modify our\naccount information.\n\n30\n00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.960\nSo make sure you're clicking\non that Account tab there.\n\n31\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.565\nAnd this is where we're going to specify\nthat user principal name because remember\n\n32\n00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:40.470\nwe can also support that\nnon-domain joined login.\n\n33\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.120\nSo what we're gonna type\nin here is Administrator.\n\n34\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.990\nMake sure it's spelled correctly.\n\n35\n00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.020\nAnd from this right section over here,\nwe have a drop-down, because we're only\n\n36\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.000\nworking with one domain, and\nthat's what we're gonna select here.\n\n37\n00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.320\nAnd I'll zoom out and\njust hit OK for that.\n\n38\n00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.320\nI don't think there's anything\nelse we need to set here for\n\n39\n00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.290\nsessions or\nspecific log-on hours or anything.\n\n40\n00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.940\nWe'll just hit OK.\n\n41\n00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.700\nAnd that should be it.\n\n42\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.531\nWe do need to hop on over\nto our PLABDMO1 machine.\n\n43\n00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.980\nThat's the machine that's housing\nthe work folders feature.\n\n44\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.030\nSo let's do that.\n\n45\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.990\nI'm just going to minimize this one.\n\n46\n00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.010\nAnd I think I have it\npulled up right over here.\n\n47\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.097\nAnd you can see right here this is,\nin fact, my PLABDMO1 machine.\n\n48\n00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:28.410\nNow, what we need to do is create\na custom- oops, and I'm going crazy here.\n\n49\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.890\nWhat we need to do is create\na custom tool bar with our snap-ins.\n\n50\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.570\nSo, in order to do that,\nthe easiest way for me,\n\n51\n00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.570\njust right click on your Start menu and\nselect Run, and all the way\n\n52\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.140\ndown here in the bottom corner, I'm\njust going to type in mmc and hit enter.\n\n53\n00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.729\nAnd this'll bring my\nMicrosoft management console.\n\n54\n00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.380\nFrom my Microsoft Management Console,\nI can create a toolbox here.\n\n55\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.556\nAnd under the File menu, I'm going to\nbe selecting Add or Remove Snap-in.\n\n56\n00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.869\nDon't know if you can see that,\nbut this is where we're headed.\n\n57\n00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:09.710\nNow we wanna be managing our\ncertificates that we created our\n\n58\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.060\nCA on our domain controller and\nwe are going to be issuing\n\n59\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.080\nthat certificate to be housed\nhere on our domain member.\n\n60\n00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.930\nSo that the clients can bring that down\nand install it on their systems so\n\n61\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.490\nthat they can trust the server and\ntrust that this information that\n\n62\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.960\nthey're getting is accurate, original,\nand has not been modified in any way.\n\n63\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.030\nSo what we need to do on the left-hand\nside, select Certificates, and\n\n64\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.657\nthen hit Add to bring it on over.\n\n65\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.290\nNow, remember, that a security\nprinciple can either be a user account,\n\n66\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.030\na service account here,\na computer account,\n\n67\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.340\nbecause we are wanting to vouch and\nverify the authenticity of this server.\n\n68\n00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.060\nLet's make sure we\nselect computer account,\n\n69\n00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.240\nthis is not something that\ncan be changed later on.\n\n70\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.710\nSo we wanna make sure we\ndo it right the first time.\n\n71\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.090\nAnd we'll hit Next,\nright behind my head, but that's okay.\n\n72\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.513\nJust a Next button.\n\n73\n00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:06.170\nLocal computer we're not setting\nthis up for another system.\n\n74\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.250\nWe are on the machine that we're\ngenerating that certificate for so\n\n75\n00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.240\nlet's just verify that this radio button\nis selected and we will hit Finish.\n\n76\n00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.790\nAll right, so we can see that\ncertificate right there for\n\n77\n00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.320\nthe local computer but that's not it yet.\n\n78\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.920\nWe need to request for\nan SSL web certificate, all right,\n\n79\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.720\nwe will just say OK to that.\n\n80\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.930\nAnd now, if I expand out on my left-hand\nside ever here, Certificates, Local.\n\n81\n00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.660\nI wanna select on Personal.\n\n82\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.210\nAnd currently I have no items to show in\nthis view so we wanna change that here.\n\n83\n00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.360\nSo what I'm gonna do is right-click And\nselect All Tasks and\n\n84\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.210\nthen Request New Certificate.\n\n85\n00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.680\nAll right, so that's gonna bring up\nmy little Enrolment Wizard here.\n\n86\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.150\nThis is just the intro page to\nhelp us get that certificate.\n\n87\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.850\nAnd the certificate type that we\nwant to bring in is going to be that\n\n88\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.054\nSSL Web Server that we had created\npreviously, we'll just hit Next for now.\n\n89\n00:05:06.054 --> 00:05:08.872\nWe're gonna be seeing\nthis on the next page,\n\n90\n00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:13.990\nthat SSL web server certificate, but\nthere is something that we need to do.\n\n91\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.159\nAnd you'll see that there's\na yellow exclamation point here and\n\n92\n00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.720\nit says more information is required\nto enroll for this certificate.\n\n93\n00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.510\nClick here to configure settings.\n\n94\n00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.440\nSo let's do that.\n\n95\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.130\nNow, when we're setting up our work\nfolders we need to have at least two\n\n96\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.410\ndifferent names here, so that's what we're\ngonna be configuring in this window here.\n\n97\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.420\nMake sure you're under this Subject Name\ntab section and then right here,\n\n98\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.660\nit even says Subject Name.\n\n99\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.930\nCurrently selected at Full DB but we\nneed to change that to a Common Name CN.\n\n100\n00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.748\nAnd the value that we're gonna be putting\nhere we're specifying this machine\n\n101\n00:05:49.748 --> 00:05:52.968\nthat we're working on so\nlet's put in PLABDM01.\n\n102\n00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:56.809\nAnd then we'll put in the fully\nqualified domain name here so\n\n103\n00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:01.554\nthis is going to be Practicelabs.com,\nI'm just gonna copy and paste real\n\n104\n00:06:01.554 --> 00:06:07.240\nquick because we're gonna be typing\nthis and again, so I'll just hit copy.\n\n105\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.780\nYou do need to hit this Add button and\nverify that it moves over to\n\n106\n00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.960\nthe right-hand pane here otherwise,\nit's not going to work correctly.\n\n107\n00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.710\nYou have to make sure you do that.\n\n108\n00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.630\nNow the next section right here where it\nsays alternative name, we need to change\n\n109\n00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.410\nthat from Directory Name,\nlet's go ahead and drop that down to DNS.\n\n110\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.834\nAnd I'm just going to copy and paste\nthe same name PLABDM01.practicelabs.com.\n\n111\n00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:33.620\nThe FQDN and add it on over to\nthe right-hand pane as well.\n\n112\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.580\nNow, I'm gonna paste again but this time\nI need to change this first portion here.\n\n113\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.890\nInstead of specifying the actual machine,\n\n114\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.060\nremember we want to access that\nvia that nickname of work folders.\n\n115\n00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.060\nSo that's what I'm putting here.\n\n116\n00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.180\nI'm gonna type in work folders.\n\n117\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.280\nAnd make sure I got an s there,\nwork folders,\n\n118\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.680\nwe'll hit Add and looks good to me.\n\n119\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.010\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee,\nlet's emphasize that again,\n\n120\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.620\nthat it is important that we\nmake sure that this matches.\n\n121\n00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.740\nIf you don't have it specific, right?\n\n122\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.670\nSo remember that earlier in the previous\nepisode Cherokee had actually\n\n123\n00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.780\ntyped that in for the alias name, so\nif here you just type in work folder,\n\n124\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.950\nCherokee, that's probably not gonna work\nif you don't have that S there, right?\n\n125\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not gonna work.\n\n126\n00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.510\nThis is definitely, like I said,\nreally when we're talking about this\n\n127\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.550\nentire process,\none little typo can really get you guys.\n\n128\n00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.460\nSo I guess it would just be better to\ntake your time and go through it slowly.\n\n129\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.600\nJust to save yourself time in the end.\n\n130\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.070\nSo we'll hit OK and\nthen back out of all these windows.\n\n131\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.400\nYou do have to just make sure that\nthat SSL web server is now selected.\n\n132\n00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.170\nIt doesn't give me any\nkind of notification.\n\n133\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.670\nSo let's go through this\nenrollment process.\n\n134\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.620\nIt should only take a second here, but at\nleast I wanna just maintain on the screen\n\n135\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.958\nto verify that it has\ncompleted successfully.\n\n136\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.878\nBecause that's another thing, when you\nget going through these processes fast,\n\n137\n00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:55.174\nmaybe sometimes something\nmight have failed and\n\n138\n00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:58.382\nyou won't know that until like five\nsteps down the road, and then.\n\n139\n00:07:58.382 --> 00:07:59.602\nThat's not fun, so.\n\n140\n00:07:59.602 --> 00:08:03.181\n&gt;&gt; And this is where all the hard\nwork that Cherokee put in in terms of\n\n141\n00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:06.710\nPowerShelling giving that\nweb enrollment feature up.\n\n142\n00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.890\nThis is the end result of what\nyou're seeing there, right?\n\n143\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.110\nThe ability that Cherokee didn't have\nto manually open up a web page and\n\n144\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.420\nthen find the certificate authority.\n\n145\n00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.077\nThen of course,\ngenerate a new certificate request.\n\n146\n00:08:20.077 --> 00:08:24.340\nBecause of the way that we set it up and\nallowed that authenticated users,\n\n147\n00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.110\nshe was able to simply use this particular\nenrollment wizard to walk her through.\n\n148\n00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.930\nAnd that's why we set it\nup the way that we did.\n\n149\n00:08:31.992 --> 00:08:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes and there's also another thing that\nwe can do here just to check to make sure\n\n150\n00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.280\neven those names they saved and\nmaintained that stage as well.\n\n151\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.050\nSo let me zoom out here.\n\n152\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.990\nNow, let me just close\nout of this a little,\n\n153\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.180\nthat was from my clipboard\nwhere I copied and pasted.\n\n154\n00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.770\nBut sometimes you might\nneed to refresh and\n\n155\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.160\nthis is that little Refresh\nicon here with a little green.\n\n156\n00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.240\nBut what we wanna do is check inside\nthese Personal folders again.\n\n157\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.960\nBecause remember, we just selected\nthat particular enrollment process.\n\n158\n00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.090\nWe do see our certificate here.\n\n159\n00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.880\nSo what you can do is right click and then\ngo to Properties just to make sure that\n\n160\n00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.830\nthose subject names did\nin fact retain there.\n\n161\n00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.710\nSo give me one second.\n\n162\n00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.960\nI think I might have clicked\non the wrong window here.\n\n163\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.319\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're probably not\ngonna have to double click on it.\n\n164\n00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:22.350\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, yeah.\n\n165\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.970\nUnder details.\n\n166\n00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.870\nThat's where I wanna be.\n\n167\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.670\nRight under here.\n\n168\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.840\nLet me zoom in so we can see that.\n\n169\n00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.080\nUnder Details and then scroll down\nuntil you find that subject but\n\n170\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.110\nit needs to say Subject Alternative Name.\n\n171\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.900\nAnd then if you see in this section here,\nit has both of those minimum of two\n\n172\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:44.570\nnames there that we see the work folders\nname and the actual machine there.\n\n173\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.530\nBut since we're already right here there's\nsomething else that we need to do too.\n\n174\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.680\nWe need to bind that certificate.\n\n175\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.158\nAnd let's scroll down and\ntake a look at the thumb print.\n\n176\n00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:58.938\nSo a Thumbprint is going to be a unique\nidentifier for this certificate.\n\n177\n00:09:58.938 --> 00:10:02.380\nAnd the Thumbprint this\nstring of characters is\n\n178\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.780\ngenerated by running an algorithm.\n\n179\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.140\nAnd you can see that the Thumbprint\nalgorithm used here is gonna be sha1.\n\n180\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.150\nSo we need to copy this.\n\n181\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.530\nSo let's just highlight it.\n\n182\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.350\nAnd we'll be using it\nhere in a few moments.\n\n183\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.320\nIt'll help us with some\ntyping if we do it this way.\n\n184\n00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.290\nSo I just selected that and\ndata copy I'm going to pull up Notepad,\n\n185\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.640\nso I can just use as\na little placeholder here.\n\n186\n00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.300\nSo I'm selecting Run and then typing\nin Notepad to pull that up for us.\n\n187\n00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.430\nNow I'm going to just hit Ctrl+V but\nlet's see, okay, it didn't copy very well.\n\n188\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:38.570\nSometimes the issuing these remote\ncommands in the virtual environment\n\n189\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.220\ndon't work out so well but\nlet's try that again.\n\n190\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.860\nSo now I see it that it took that, it\nput it in my little clipboard over here.\n\n191\n00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.630\nAnd now I can paste it into my window.\n\n192\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.110\nNow this is kind of cool.\n\n193\n00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.210\nI don't know if you've ever worked in\nNotepad to kind of remove these spaces.\n\n194\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.370\nInstead of going through and\nmanually doing it one at a time.\n\n195\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.720\nSomething that you can do\nhere to save some time.\n\n196\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.310\nUnder the Edit drop down menu,\nyou can select Replace.\n\n197\n00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.300\nNow, what's it's going to do is\nyou're just specifying these values.\n\n198\n00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.810\nWhat we're gonna be replacing.\n\n199\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.600\nIf you put your cursor\nin this first window and\n\n200\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.640\nhit the Spacebar button one time.\n\n201\n00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.390\nI know you can't see anything there but\n\n202\n00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.220\nit's actually accepting\nthat Spacebar value.\n\n203\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.190\nAnd I'm gonna be replacing it with well,\n\n204\n00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.340\nlet's not put anything\ninto this value field.\n\n205\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.590\nSo what we're essentially\nsaying is let's replace every\n\n206\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.460\nspot there's a space with nothing.\n\n207\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.742\nSo it'll just be enumerating or\n\n208\n00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:38.312\nconcatenating those characters\nthat are already listed here.\n\n209\n00:11:38.312 --> 00:11:40.540\nSo we'll hit Replace All.\n\n210\n00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.150\nIf you just do it once, you'll have\nto do it for every little time but\n\n211\n00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.110\nwe'll just hit Replace All,\nand you'll close out of here.\n\n212\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.110\nAnd you'll see how it removes all that.\n\n213\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.540\nNow, it's kind of strange the way that\nthis thumb print is encoded, you have even\n\n214\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.592\nthe ability to export your thumb print\nin different encoding mechanisms here.\n\n215\n00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:03.990\nBut because the system sees it\nas not just ASCII characters.\n\n216\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.540\nIt also sees it recognizes\nUnicode in this string.\n\n217\n00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.530\nSomething that you could do.\n\n218\n00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.000\nYou could hit the Spacebar and\n\n219\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.800\nthen the Backspace you'll see\nwhy when we get to it later.\n\n220\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.090\nIf not that's not a big deal.\n\n221\n00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.100\nYou'll just have like a little\nbit of extra step to do but\n\n222\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.010\nI'm gonna minimize this for now and\nhold on to that little thumb print there.\n\n223\n00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.470\nAnd that's going to be your\nthumbprint is your GUID for\n\n224\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.220\nthat particular certificate, so\nit's our globally unique identifier.\n\n225\n00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.270\nAnd we need to use that to\nspecify this certificate.\n\n226\n00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.800\nAnd just note though,\nif you ever go back and\n\n227\n00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:38.110\nare modifying that certificate,\nit can cause problems.\n\n228\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.299\nOnce you get it set up, you really need\nto make sure that that's the way you're\n\n229\n00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:46.250\nhaving things setup and even if you're\ntaking a computer off of a domain.\n\n230\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.856\nAnd then rejoining it to a domain, you'll\nhave to pull that certificate back down\n\n231\n00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:55.080\nbecause that's what it's designed for\nto maintain that security there.\n\n232\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.430\nAnd if you're modifying and\nchanging things, it's like aah.\n\n233\n00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.800\nSomething is awry and I don't know\nwhat to do with that, all right.\n\n234\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.758\nLet's just hit OK for now.\n\n235\n00:13:03.758 --> 00:13:09.392\nAnd the next thing that we need to do\nmatter of fact is let's go ahead and\n\n236\n00:13:09.392 --> 00:13:13.270\nbind this information\nhere to our IIS core.\n\n237\n00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.130\nNow because when we set\nthat up we used PowerShell\n\n238\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.960\ninstall that particular feature.\n\n239\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.890\nWe don't have a GUID that's associated\nwith that so we're gonna need to use our\n\n240\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:26.060\ncommand prompt here and\nwe ill need to use the Netsh command.\n\n241\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.750\nSo let me just make sure we're\non the right location here and\n\n242\n00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.890\nthat I'm not forgetting any thing else.\n\n243\n00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.460\nI do not think that we\nput that on this machine.\n\n244\n00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.450\nSo let me go a head and\njust make sure that I did that here.\n\n245\n00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.090\nWell, let's pull up PowerShell.\n\n246\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.420\nAnd let me change this a little bit so\nwe can see what we're doing.\n\n247\n00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.160\nYeah we didn't put that on here yet\nso all right.\n\n248\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.820\nOkay, we need to pull up PowerShell and\n\n249\n00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.850\nwe're gonna make sure that we have\nthis IIS core installed here.\n\n250\n00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:01.004\nSo let's type in Add- and\nwe're gonna type in windowsFeature.\n\n251\n00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:07.420\nFor our windowsFeature,\nyou can type in the space.\n\n252\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.089\nYou need to type in the space but\nthis couple of FS, like I said,\n\n253\n00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:13.932\nthis part is optional for\nthe capitalization but\n\n254\n00:14:13.932 --> 00:14:17.493\nI'm just gonna keep it here for\nour FS-Sync, S-Y-N-C.\n\n255\n00:14:17.493 --> 00:14:19.200\nThis is going to be our\nsync share service.\n\n256\n00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:24.970\nShareservice, all right.\n\n257\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:30.523\nAnd that's going to be our web-whc.\n\n258\n00:14:32.166 --> 00:14:36.891\nAnd we will specify our management tools\n\n259\n00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:45.805\nSorry, I'm getting crazy with my typing.\n\n260\n00:14:47.707 --> 00:14:50.801\nAll right, we should be good here,\njust give it a second,\n\n261\n00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:52.930\nwanted to make sure we have that.\n\n262\n00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.656\nA couple things before we actually do that\nbinding, I was trying to get ahead or\n\n263\n00:14:56.656 --> 00:14:58.525\nourselves here but that's all right.\n\n264\n00:14:58.525 --> 00:15:03.077\nThis is just gonna take one second here,\nso we're making sure that we\n\n265\n00:15:03.077 --> 00:15:07.404\ndo have this particular feature\nenabled on our PLABDM01 here.\n\n266\n00:15:07.404 --> 00:15:12.060\nWe do need to create an actual work\nfolders folder on our C drive.\n\n267\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.350\nSo while this is running let's\ndo that in the background.\n\n268\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.130\nYou can just pull up File Explorer and I'm\ngonna put mine right here on the C drive.\n\n269\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:23.760\nAnd we need to keep it in a location\nwhere we know where it is and\n\n270\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.890\nthat it can be easily accessible.\n\n271\n00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:31.046\nSo I'm just gonna select New and\nthen Folder and workfolders.\n\n272\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.940\nWorkfolders.\n\n273\n00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.450\nMake sure, yep with the s there,\nso plural.\n\n274\n00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.082\nI do need to set a couple NTFS\npermissions just to make sure that those\n\n275\n00:15:43.082 --> 00:15:44.050\nare configured.\n\n276\n00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:49.690\nSo let's select Properties and\nover under our Security tab,\n\n277\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:55.452\nI wanna make sure that my users\nare able to access this machine.\n\n278\n00:15:55.452 --> 00:15:57.586\nSo I do need to set that.\n\n279\n00:15:57.586 --> 00:16:00.355\nA couple, two different settings here.\n\n280\n00:16:00.355 --> 00:16:04.950\nSo number one, we're going to edit\nthe users that are all ready here.\n\n281\n00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.520\nSo let's select Edit.\n\n282\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.190\nAnd we wanna grant\nthe modify permission here.\n\n283\n00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.947\nSo if I make sure I have user selected and\nthat I select Modify.\n\n284\n00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:18.110\nAll right and hit OK.\n\n285\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.820\nI also need to add an additional group for\nauthenticated users.\n\n286\n00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.640\nSo I don't have authenticated users\ncurrently listed here as that group.\n\n287\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.430\nSo let's select Edit and then Add.\n\n288\n00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.080\nSo we need to actually add\nthem in the Active Directory.\n\n289\n00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.880\nAnd It looks a little fuzzy there but\nUsers.\n\n290\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.892\nLet's just hit Check Names to verify,\nso as long as we got that, nope.\n\n291\n00:16:48.892 --> 00:16:51.018\n&gt;&gt; You misspell authenticated.\n\n292\n00:16:51.018 --> 00:16:53.010\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nyeah it looks a little fuzzy there.\n\n293\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.160\nLet me just try it again.\n\n294\n00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:00.940\nAs long as I got my underline,\nthat's what I'm looking for.\n\n295\n00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.889\nOkay I got my my underline,\nwhere good to go, let's hit OK.\n\n296\n00:17:04.889 --> 00:17:08.351\nNow I also make sure that I\nhave the Modify ability for\n\n297\n00:17:08.351 --> 00:17:10.640\nthat authenticated users group.\n\n298\n00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.083\nSo I want to make sure I hit Allow, just\nthat I don't come to any kind of snags\n\n299\n00:17:15.083 --> 00:17:18.189\nwhen I have my user who's\ntrying to authenticate and\n\n300\n00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:20.042\naccess to my work folder here.\n\n301\n00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:22.290\nSo we've set the settings, we'll hit OK.\n\n302\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.870\nAnd I think we'll be good to go there.\n\n303\n00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.750\nWhat's up next on the agenda here?\n\n304\n00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.670\nAll right, so\nlet's hop over to Server Manager here.\n\n305\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.390\nWe can minimize File Explorer and\nrunning in the background,\n\n306\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.870\nyou can see that we did have\na success under this column here.\n\n307\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.910\nSuccess true when we were adding our\n\n308\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.390\ncomplete feature here, so\nthat we're good to go.\n\n309\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.310\nWe don't have to worry about that anymore.\n\n310\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.590\nI'm just gonna close out of this\nclipboard, and close at a PowerShell for\n\n311\n00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.740\nright now.\n\n312\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.403\nAnd let's minimize our console.\n\n313\n00:17:57.403 --> 00:17:59.830\nWe're back in Server Manager here.\n\n314\n00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:05.024\nAnd from Server Manager, what I wanna\ndo is select on the left hand side,\n\n315\n00:18:05.024 --> 00:18:10.160\nI have file and storage and\nI wanna select my Work Folders.\n\n316\n00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.410\nOkay, now that we've\nselected Work Folders,\n\n317\n00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.500\nwe can currently see that there are 0\ncurrent sync shares that are here.\n\n318\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.360\nObviously, we just created that,\nso we need to set one up.\n\n319\n00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.580\nIf we zoom in there's\na link here that says,\n\n320\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.460\nto create a link sync share for\nwork folders, start the New Sync Wizard.\n\n321\n00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.750\nSo let's click that and\njust give it a moment to begin and\n\n322\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.280\nI can kind of move on over so\nwe can see what we're doing.\n\n323\n00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.310\nSo this is just the introduction\npage we'll hit Next.\n\n324\n00:18:38.038 --> 00:18:42.562\nNow because I can utilize this concept and\nshare out an entire volume,\n\n325\n00:18:42.562 --> 00:18:46.690\nthat's what this first option\nis here with this location.\n\n326\n00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.990\nBut because I already have\ncreated that work folder,\n\n327\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.380\nwe have created it on our C\ndrive that work folders folder.\n\n328\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.380\nThat's what I wanna specify here.\n\n329\n00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.840\nSo let's just go ahead and\ntype that location in.\n\n330\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.604\nSo I wanna make sure I hit c:\\workfolders.\n\n331\n00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:01.330\nI'll remove my arrow so\nwe can see what we're doing.\n\n332\n00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:06.251\nFolders, and we'll hit Next.\n\n333\n00:19:06.251 --> 00:19:12.470\nNow, on this page, it says, Specify\nthe structure for the user folders.\n\n334\n00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:16.790\nSo I could leave this first option\nselected here because I'm only\n\n335\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.450\nworking with one domain.\n\n336\n00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.660\nBut the problem that may happen is,\nyou know what Ronnie,\n\n337\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.120\nwhat if we wanna grow our organization and\nI wanna add another domain?\n\n338\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.484\nAnd maybe there is another CBoose in\nthe domain or RWong in the domain.\n\n339\n00:19:28.484 --> 00:19:32.412\nThere would be conflicts there,\nso if I select the second option,\n\n340\n00:19:32.412 --> 00:19:36.553\nthat's going to eliminate conflicts\nbetween identical user aliases\n\n341\n00:19:36.553 --> 00:19:39.940\nwithin different domains\nunder that same forest there.\n\n342\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.270\nSo that's the option I wanna choose here.\n\n343\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.150\nNow, I do have other options.\n\n344\n00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.750\nBecause we just created that\nworkfolders folder, and\n\n345\n00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.350\nthere's nothing in\nthe actual work folder yet.\n\n346\n00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.110\nI do have the ability to pick and\n\n347\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.870\nchoose different components that I\nwant to sync within work folders.\n\n348\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.832\nSo maybe I'm already implementing\nsomething like folder redirects.\n\n349\n00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:06.278\nAnd it would be redundant for me to have\nmultiple syncs coming across my network\n\n350\n00:20:06.278 --> 00:20:11.737\nand if I wanted to, I could select that\nbut just know that that option is there.\n\n351\n00:20:11.737 --> 00:20:15.140\nBut we'll hit Next.\n\n352\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.698\nAnd let me just zoom out\na little bit here, sorry.\n\n353\n00:20:25.269 --> 00:20:25.900\nThere we go.\n\n354\n00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.710\nTrying to get everything on this screen.\n\n355\n00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.650\nI'm gonna leave mine with\na default of work folders.\n\n356\n00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.260\nAnd then you can just put any kind of\ndescription you wanted to for that\n\n357\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.060\nproduction environment there, but I'll\nleave it blank for now and we'll hit Next.\n\n358\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.090\nNow this is kind of interesting.\n\n359\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.309\nYou might wanna pay attention this as\nwell in this last page of our sync share.\n\n360\n00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.950\nWe are going to modify it a bit.\n\n361\n00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.590\nBut I wanted to point out while I remember\nthis little tick mark at the bottom.\n\n362\n00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.090\nIt says Disable inherited permissions and\n\n363\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.820\ngrant users exclusive\naccess to their files.\n\n364\n00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.060\nSo what does that mean?\n\n365\n00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.087\nWell, that means the admin can view and\n\n366\n00:21:03.087 --> 00:21:09.150\nobtain information about their storage\nlimitations and quotas and so forth.\n\n367\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:15.346\nBut their actual data\nwill remain concealed.\n\n368\n00:21:15.346 --> 00:21:19.886\nSo there's going to be a policy\nnotification from the end users side and\n\n369\n00:21:19.886 --> 00:21:22.890\nthat'll alert them to how you set this up.\n\n370\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.000\nSo like I said, we want to be completely\ntransparent here in the IT department.\n\n371\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.800\nSo that they know, hey, Ronnie has\naccess to read my documents or whatever,\n\n372\n00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.170\nso you just wanna make sure that\nyou are in compliance there.\n\n373\n00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:34.970\nAll right, so\n\n374\n00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.390\nonce we have that set we also need to\ngrant access to our domain users here.\n\n375\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:45.598\nSo let's hit Add and\nwe need to specify domain users.\n\n376\n00:21:47.331 --> 00:21:51.014\nAnd we'll just hit Check Names to\nmake sure that it gets underlined.\n\n377\n00:21:51.014 --> 00:21:52.267\nWe'll hit OK.\n\n378\n00:21:52.267 --> 00:21:56.098\nAnd then, let's hit Next.\n\n379\n00:21:56.098 --> 00:21:58.040\nNow we also have another option here.\n\n380\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.610\nSo again,\naccording to your network access control\n\n381\n00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.940\npolicy which you should have one in place\nespecially for this mobile devices.\n\n382\n00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:12.760\nIt should clearly define the requirements\nset forth before these devices\n\n383\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.100\nare gonna be pulling down business related\ninformation, sensitive information.\n\n384\n00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.990\nSo this one's kind of a given\nI mean even I think every\n\n385\n00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.870\nsmartphone at this point in time has\nthat automatic lock screen enabled.\n\n386\n00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.780\nSo your mobile devices, you just wanna\nmake sure that's kind of a given.\n\n387\n00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.460\nBut if you wanted to enable encryption,\nyou have the ability to do so as well.\n\n388\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.480\nSo it's just another\nlayer of protection here.\n\n389\n00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.444\nSo let's select that and\nthen we'll go ahead and\n\n390\n00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:44.568\nround out this particular sync and\nget that set up.\n\n391\n00:22:44.568 --> 00:22:48.452\nYou might wanna save this information,\nscreen shot it to document as well and\n\n392\n00:22:48.452 --> 00:22:50.390\nlet's hit Create.\n\n393\n00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.690\nThis'll just take a few seconds.\n\n394\n00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.550\nWe can see here that the status\nwas in fact complete.\n\n395\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.750\nAnd we'll go ahead and close out.\n\n396\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:04.270\nAll right, now this is where we see that\nnew work that SyncShare listed right here.\n\n397\n00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.290\nAnd underneath, these are my domain users.\n\n398\n00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.220\nSo I didn't fill these in individually.\n\n399\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.770\nThey're all right here.\n\n400\n00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.990\nAnd I could go ahead and\nmanage them from this interface as well.\n\n401\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:21.950\nSo you know maybe Elizabeth just\ngot demoted or maybe she's under\n\n402\n00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.030\nsome kind of temporary suspension due to\nsome kind of situation that's happened.\n\n403\n00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:31.225\nSo we have the ability even here\nto suspend, if necessary, so\n\n404\n00:23:31.225 --> 00:23:34.255\nthey're not able to access those folders\nbecause you do have to think about,\n\n405\n00:23:34.255 --> 00:23:37.295\nhey this is our sensitive work\ninformation that is being stored here.\n\n406\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.270\nAlso there is information about\nthe capacity that each individual users\n\n407\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.190\nbeing limited to here.\n\n408\n00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.880\nYou can set NTFS quotas and so forth.\n\n409\n00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.500\nBut at least this gives\nyou a good understanding.\n\n410\n00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.536\nThat's not it for work folders though,\nthere are few additional configurations\n\n411\n00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:58.351\nthat we need to do before we have that\nsync discovery and connectivity there.\n\n412\n00:23:58.351 --> 00:24:00.910\nBut I think for\nthis show we are running out of time.\n\n413\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.540\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee.\n\n414\n00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.320\nWell thank you again for\ngetting us this far where we've actually\n\n415\n00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.505\ntaken a little bit further than\nwhat we did in the episode before.\n\n416\n00:24:08.505 --> 00:24:11.770\nRemember that this is a process but\nonce everything is set up the way that\n\n417\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.990\nneeds to be, it actually works\nincredibly well and fairly seamlessly.\n\n418\n00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.385\nSo, there is more to come in and that\nmeans we're ready for another episode.\n\n419\n00:24:19.385 --> 00:24:20.960\nBut for this episode we're done.\n\n420\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.562\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n421\n00:24:24.562 --> 00:24:25.577\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:08.327\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:12.397\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:14.880\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here in ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.120\nYou're watching the MCSA for Windows\nServer 2012 Specifically for exam 70-410.\n\n7\n00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.930\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n8\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.495\ntoday we're actually continuing\nonto an actual mini series here.\n\n9\n00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.664\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee Boose has brought us into\n\n10\n00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:31.410\na part five.\n\n11\n00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.375\nWe're only two or\nthree movies short of Harry Potter.\n\n12\n00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Stop.\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee [LAUGH] here we go.\n\n13\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.870\nCherokee welcome back to the show.\n\n14\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.170\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie you joke but\n\n15\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.572\nhere's the thing, the good news is\nthat yeah this does take awhile.\n\n16\n00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:47.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not the.\n\n17\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.750\n&gt;&gt; The good news.\n\n18\n00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.740\n&gt;&gt; That's not the good news.\n\n19\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.560\nOkay [LAUGH] rephrase that.\n\n20\n00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.659\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.397\n&gt;&gt; The good news is that the most common\nfunction that you'll be performing,\n\n22\n00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:00.412\nonly takes a few moments.\n\n23\n00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:02.662\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.\n&gt;&gt; So you set this up once,\n\n24\n00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:08.460\nwell you can have multiple shares\nwithin your environment, but.\n\n25\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.460\nFor the most part it'll be very seldom\nthat you're setting this configuration up\n\n26\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.010\nwhere you'll be replicating\n\n27\n00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.670\nthat configuration it's\ngonna be on the client side.\n\n28\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.848\nAnd that's relatively quick so\nthat's the good news guys.\n\n29\n00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:25.295\n[LAUGH] But thank you for being with us,\nwe're almost finished I promise.\n\n30\n00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:30.410\nEven if [LAUGH] I'm not gonna let Ronnie\nleave we're gonna get this done right?\n\n31\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.505\nSo just hang in there with me.\n\n32\n00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:34.053\nI'm here working this out with you,\nwe're gonna get this done.\n\n33\n00:01:34.053 --> 00:01:37.230\nNow, remember what have we done already?\n\n34\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.160\nWell in the last section,\nwe took that certificate,\n\n35\n00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.730\nwe requested that certificate.\n\n36\n00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.940\nWe got the enrollment successfully.\n\n37\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.304\nBut now we need to take that certificate\nand actually bind it to our work folder.\n\n38\n00:01:49.304 --> 00:01:54.331\nAnd because we're going to be utilizing\nthat core web IIS functionality,\n\n39\n00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.222\nI don't have a graphical user interface.\n\n40\n00:01:57.222 --> 00:02:00.342\nSo we're going to now this is where\nwe gonna be using that SH and\n\n41\n00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:02.100\nthe command prompt to do so.\n\n42\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670\nIf you can recall in the previous show,\n\n43\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.170\nI asked you to keep that thumb print\nin your minimized notepad window.\n\n44\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.450\nHopefully, you didn't close out\nof that because you will need it.\n\n45\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.130\nOtherwise, you'll just have to go back and\ngrab that again.\n\n46\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.020\nSo let's get started here and\n\n47\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.760\nwe'll work with binding our\ncertificate to our work folder.\n\n48\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.100\nThe first thing I need to do is\npull up a command prompt here.\n\n49\n00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.030\nSo let's just go ahead and run.\n\n50\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.940\nActually, I'm not sure,\nI can't remember if this has to be\n\n51\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.620\ndone as an administrator,\nrun as an elevated command prompt.\n\n52\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.780\nSo I'd rather just be\nsafe than sorry here.\n\n53\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.320\nSo I'm gonna select Command Prompt and\nright-click, and\n\n54\n00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.700\nthen select Run As Administrator.\n\n55\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.920\nAnd let me just do a bit of editing\nhere so we can get the right size.\n\n56\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.810\nNow you see what's going on.\n\n57\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.440\nAll right!\n\n58\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.850\nNow we're gonna be using the Netsh\ncommand, so let's go ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.600\ntype in Netsh and we need to add\n\n60\n00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.460\nour IP ports and bind it with that\nparticular GUI that thumb prints there.\n\n61\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.044\nSo we'll type in that sh, and the next\nthing we need to do is type in HTTP and\n\n62\n00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:20.392\nthen add our sslcert,\n\n63\n00:03:20.392 --> 00:03:26.970\nC-E-R-T, space, and\nthen let's specify the IP port.\n\n64\n00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.080\nAnd we're gonna put it in\na socket style address here.\n\n65\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.573\nSo we'll put port equals,\nwe'll put the IP address of 192 .168.\n\n66\n00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:41.643\nNow this is gonna be different depending\non if you are setting up this in real life\n\n67\n00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:44.090\nit needs to reflect\nthe actual IP address here.\n\n68\n00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.110\nSo that's why we are putting in.\n\n69\n00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.000\nNow we're gonna use the calling to specify\nthe socket here and the port remember for\n\n70\n00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.990\nHTTPS although we didn't type\nHTTP we did specify SSL there.\n\n71\n00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.705\nSo to make sure we type in port 443 for\nthat particular socket and\n\n72\n00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:05.120\nthen hit Space and type in cert hash.\n\n73\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.970\nRemember that show one hash that we\ncopied there for our thumbprint.\n\n74\n00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.350\nSo we'll type in the equal sign.\n\n75\n00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.677\nAnd this is where we're gonna pull up\nthat little notepad with that thumbprint\n\n76\n00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:17.400\nlisted.\n\n77\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.100\nSo let's highlight and then just Copy,\nand I noted that it copied there.\n\n78\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.610\nNow when you're back in your command\nprompt, you're gonna need to use this drop\n\n79\n00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.935\ndown menu and then select Edit and\nthen Paste, and it should bring that in.\n\n80\n00:04:31.935 --> 00:04:35.990\nOoh, and I didn't completely get\nrid of that little character there.\n\n81\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.910\nIf you can see, let me zoom in.\n\n82\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.110\nThere's like a little square.\n\n83\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.610\nSometimes it comes in as a question mark,\nbut let's delete that.\n\n84\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.080\nAnd that's what I was trying to\nprevent by hitting that space there.\n\n85\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.730\nSometimes, I guess if you hit like\ntwo spaces and then back it up.\n\n86\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.910\nBut anyway, so you just want to make sure\nthat you only have the thumbprint and\n\n87\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.829\nnot any random characters here.\n\n88\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.310\nWe're gonna hit the space bar after that.\n\n89\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.219\nAnd then we're gonna be\ntyping in our appId.\n\n90\n00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:07.088\nAll right?\n\n91\n00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:13.470\nSo, our appId is going to\nbe different in real life.\n\n92\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.390\nHere, it really doesn't matter\nin this testing environment.\n\n93\n00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.720\nSo when I set my appId,\nI'm gonna put appId=, and\n\n94\n00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.054\nI'm gonna specify curly bracket.\n\n95\n00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:26.080\nWhatever I put inside this curly bracket\ndoes need to be the same if you're going\n\n96\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.560\nto be connecting and\nworking with it elsewhere.\n\n97\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.920\nSo just kind of note it and write it down.\n\n98\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.198\nNow practice labs gives us\na really easy one to remember so\n\n99\n00:05:34.198 --> 00:05:35.984\nI'm gonna stick with theirs.\n\n100\n00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:38.480\nIt's just\n\n101\n00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:48.480\n00112233-4455-6677-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF.\n\n102\n00:05:55.684 --> 00:05:58.640\nLet's make sure we end that curly bracket.\n\n103\n00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.590\nHit a Space, and\nthen specify the cert store.\n\n104\n00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.270\nAnd we are choosing this\nname my at the end.\n\n105\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.660\nSo, and again you can select\nsomething else, it would just,\n\n106\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.790\nyou would just need to\ntake note of that as well.\n\n107\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.310\nSo for us,\n\n108\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.630\nwe'll just keep it as that default,\nthat Practice Labs, has in their lab.\n\n109\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.920\nSo certstore equals.\n\n110\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.820\n&gt;&gt; You misspelled store.\n\n111\n00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Sor, you'd think that as\nmuch shopping I like to do.\n\n112\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.860\nAll right, equals-\n&gt;&gt; Sor is a different location.\n\n113\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely not in the store.\n\n114\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.970\nSo let's hit Enter here.\n\n115\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.860\nAnd we wanna verify that our SSL\nCertificate has been successfully added.\n\n116\n00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.429\nSo now we've binded.\n\n117\n00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:37.333\nBound.\n\n118\n00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:38.237\n&gt;&gt; Bound.\n\n119\n00:06:38.237 --> 00:06:42.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We've bound it to our work folder here.\n\n120\n00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:43.790\nAll right.\n\n121\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.820\nThe next thing we need to do is take\nthat certificate, and go ahead and\n\n122\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.630\nexport it to a specified location.\n\n123\n00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.450\nSo that it's easily accessible by our end\nusers and then we'll import it from there.\n\n124\n00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.780\nSo let me just close out of our command\nprompt here, and let's make sure,\n\n125\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.900\nbecause we currently just\ndid that binding on our\n\n126\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.710\nPLABDM01, so that was our machine\nhosting that work folder, but we need to\n\n127\n00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.810\nhop on over to our domain controllers\nto perform this second function here.\n\n128\n00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:18.739\nSo let's just zoom in to verify,\nyes I am now on PLABDCO1.\n\n129\n00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:21.238\nSo what I wanna do here,\nfrom server manager, and\n\n130\n00:07:21.238 --> 00:07:24.571\nthe drop down menu over on my\nright-hand side, select Tools, and\n\n131\n00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.270\nthen I'm going to select\nCertification Authority.\n\n132\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.800\nGive it a second to load.\n\n133\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.095\nNow, over here on my right-hand\nside what I'm gonna do is select,\n\n134\n00:07:36.095 --> 00:07:39.050\nright-click and then select Properties.\n\n135\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.280\nGive it a second here and it'll pop up.\n\n136\n00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:51.700\nShould see my certificate noted\nafter it comes up And we're waiting.\n\n137\n00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.340\nThere it is.\n\n138\n00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.253\nAll right, I'm so impatient,\nsomething I'm working on.\n\n139\n00:07:56.253 --> 00:08:00.001\nAll right, here we have our\ncertificates here that's listed here.\n\n140\n00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:01.820\nWhat we can do is select View Certificate.\n\n141\n00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.035\nAll right.\n\n142\n00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:10.010\nNow let me zoom out just slightly so\nwe can see what we're doing here.\n\n143\n00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.000\nOne of our site view certificate,\nthere's a Details tab.\n\n144\n00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.110\nWe've already looked at this before, but\nwhat I wanna do now is actually take\n\n145\n00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.370\nadvantage of copying it to a file\nwhich is this button right here.\n\n146\n00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:28.400\nSo Copy to file, and\nthis is going to be an Export Wizard.\n\n147\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.370\nWhich is really nice because sometimes\nyou can see that there are different,\n\n148\n00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.620\nlike I was mentioning,\ndifferent encoding formats here.\n\n149\n00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.450\nIt's really important to make sure that\nyou're selecting the right one for\n\n150\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.460\nyour environment.\n\n151\n00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.960\nWe're gonna use the DER encoding, D-E-R,\nand we'll just leave it at that default.\n\n152\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.680\nWe'll hit Next.\n\n153\n00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.460\nAnd for our location, let's go ahead and\nput that on our C drive for easy access.\n\n154\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.865\nSo c:\\ this is going to be\non our domain controller.\n\n155\n00:08:54.865 --> 00:09:00.571\nReally anywhere where you know you're\nputting it is fine so PLABDC01.\n\n156\n00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:04.401\nWe'll hit Next and Finish.\n\n157\n00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:07.340\nAnd we've exported successfully.\n\n158\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.080\nNow the next thing we need to do is\nmake sure that we import that for\n\n159\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.060\nevery client that we're\ngonna be working with.\n\n160\n00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.746\nSo let me just zoom out here and\nwe can minimize.\n\n161\n00:09:20.336 --> 00:09:22.416\nAnd then pull up our client.\n\n162\n00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:23.350\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\n\n163\n00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.820\ndoes this mean that we're actually just\nabout done with the configuration?\n\n164\n00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.060\n&gt;&gt; Server side, yes.\n\n165\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.330\nBut Ronnie, we do need to make sure that\nwe have everything set up on our client.\n\n166\n00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.470\nAnd then test our client to make\nsure that they're good to go.\n\n167\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.250\nWe don't just wanna leave them hanging.\n\n168\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.350\nSo if we can check out\nmy machine right here.\n\n169\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.860\nI have a Windows 8.1 machine and\nnow that we've just exported\n\n170\n00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.778\nthat certificate to the C drive of our\ndomain controller, I need to access that.\n\n171\n00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:51.500\nSo you wanna make sure things like\nyour network discovery is enabled so\n\n172\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.087\nthat I do have access to that.\n\n173\n00:09:53.087 --> 00:09:56.894\nSo what I'm gonna do is just right-click\non my Start button and select Run.\n\n174\n00:09:56.894 --> 00:10:00.181\nAnd I'm gonna use my network path here.\n\n175\n00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:02.666\nLet me zoom in so\nwe can see what's happening.\n\n176\n00:10:02.666 --> 00:10:09.151\nThis is gonna be \\\\,\nthe name of my domain controller PLABDC01.\n\n177\n00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:12.667\nAnd if I wanna go ahead and get that\nC drive, I'll just note that as well.\n\n178\n00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:15.914\nSo this is gonna be \\cmoney,\ndid you know that's my nickname.\n\n179\n00:10:15.914 --> 00:10:17.429\n&gt;&gt; Cmoney I did.\n\n180\n00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:23.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll hit OK and zoom out.\n\n181\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.743\nNow, we can see the contents of that\ndomain controller's C drive listed here,\n\n182\n00:10:27.743 --> 00:10:30.460\nthis is that certificate\nthat we had exported.\n\n183\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.600\nSo now we need to bring that\ncert here on the local machine.\n\n184\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.930\nSo what we need to do is right click and\nthen from this Action menu,\n\n185\n00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.070\nselect Install Certificate, all right.\n\n186\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.388\nSo now once we get this Welcome\nto the Certificate Import Wizard,\n\n187\n00:10:46.388 --> 00:10:50.720\nwe wanna make sure that we\nare selecting our actual machine here.\n\n188\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.880\nSo for this import,\nI just wanna make sure that's right.\n\n189\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.630\nWe wanna change it from\ncurrent user to machine so\n\n190\n00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.170\nthat it's independent of\nwhomever is logging on.\n\n191\n00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.724\nAnd we'll hit Next.\n\n192\n00:11:01.724 --> 00:11:08.541\nAnd also if you're utilizing\nfederated resource manager.\n\n193\n00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:10.840\nExcuse me, I'm getting a little\ncrazy with my acronyms here.\n\n194\n00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:16.930\nBut you can specify where only\ncertain devices can even log on.\n\n195\n00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.270\nBut here we're just kind of like hey,\nif Ronnie buys a new iPad or\n\n196\n00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.880\na new tablet then he is able\nto go ahead and log on.\n\n197\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.370\nSo we'll just leave that with our\nautomatically select certificate store.\n\n198\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.930\nActually I need to change this.\n\n199\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.370\nSo I need to change the location here and\nspecify for that C drive.\n\n200\n00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.100\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n201\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.220\nLet’s go ahead and browse to\nthe Trusted Root Certification Authority’s\n\n202\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.720\nlocation and select OK, that'll fill in.\n\n203\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.690\nWe'll select Next and then Finish.\n\n204\n00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.160\nNow in order to make this change\ntake effect we really should restart\n\n205\n00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:51.860\nthis machine.\n\n206\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.520\nSo one way we could do that.\n\n207\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.830\nOkay, so we do see the import was\nsuccessful but in order to force that\n\n208\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.530\nchange into our system let's go ahead and\ntype in shut down.\n\n209\n00:12:04.712 --> 00:12:08.310\nSpace / and we're just\nspecifying the r parameter here.\n\n210\n00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.457\nAnd I'll zoom in so you can see I'm\njust putting it in this path here.\n\n211\n00:12:11.457 --> 00:12:16.650\nAnd then /t for the time, and\nthen specify the amount in seconds here 0.\n\n212\n00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.520\nWe'll hit Enter and\nit'll force that restart.\n\n213\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:24.580\nSo this is really it we may be coming to\nthe end of our miniseries here Ronnie.\n\n214\n00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.300\nWe need to give this machine a second to\nactually go through that reboot process.\n\n215\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.016\nWe don't want to get too antsy.\n\n216\n00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:35.460\nSo we're gonna be bringing\nthis machine back online and\n\n217\n00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.700\nthen navigating to our work folders\njust to verify that everything\n\n218\n00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.930\nwe'll need to set it up and sync it.\n\n219\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.540\nBut we should be good after that.\n\n220\n00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n221\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.910\nSo while we have a moment here let's\ntalk about some of the steps that we\n\n222\n00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.880\ndid go ahead and set in place\nto make sure that it happened.\n\n223\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.700\nSo at the very beginning when we\nstarted this little journey together\n\n224\n00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.880\nwe did end up setting up\na certificate authority,\n\n225\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.000\nas well as the enrollment process and\neverything to get that set up.\n\n226\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.230\nMost of the time in a real\nproduction environment,\n\n227\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.420\nthat's not something you're gonna\ngenerally have to worry about.\n\n228\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.040\nSo either you already have a certificate\nauthority running inside of your network\n\n229\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.490\nor it could be where they said, look.\n\n230\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.340\nWe're gonna get a third party certificate\neither one will end up working just kinda\n\n231\n00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:19.892\nrealized.\n\n232\n00:13:19.892 --> 00:13:23.175\nBut Cherokee showed you that,\nthe harder way to do it which is fine but\n\n233\n00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:25.504\nbecause it's also the way\nthat the lab is built.\n\n234\n00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:28.565\nBut it is good practice for you to do so.\n\n235\n00:13:28.565 --> 00:13:31.700\nSo with Cherokee after we actually\ngot a certificate authority up,\n\n236\n00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.917\nwhat else do we have to do?\n\n237\n00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:35.184\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're just going to\ntest it from our clients side.\n\n238\n00:13:35.184 --> 00:13:38.360\nBut Ronnie I did want to just kind of\nexpand on what you had said there about\n\n239\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.257\nthat certificate.\n\n240\n00:13:39.257 --> 00:13:42.137\nBecause we debuted that\nself certificate yes,\n\n241\n00:13:42.137 --> 00:13:45.377\nwe did take the more difficult\npath to get that set up.\n\n242\n00:13:45.377 --> 00:13:47.760\nBut the thing is,\nwe didn't have to pay anyone to do it.\n\n243\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.730\nWe did it ourself.\n\n244\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.970\nSo we would have had to have paid someone,\na third party,\n\n245\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.150\nif we chose to use a third party or\nexternal certificate there.\n\n246\n00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.604\nThe other thing you might\nwanna be considerate of,\n\n247\n00:13:57.604 --> 00:14:01.307\nif you are setting this up\nin a corporate environment.\n\n248\n00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.192\nSomething that may cause you troubles,\n\n249\n00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:06.148\nif you don't verify it first\nwould be your firewall settings.\n\n250\n00:14:06.148 --> 00:14:11.543\nSo we wanna make sure that we're not\nutilizing any kind of public profile with\n\n251\n00:14:11.543 --> 00:14:17.781\nour servers because that's going to have a\nmore restrictive Windows Firewall setting.\n\n252\n00:14:17.781 --> 00:14:21.451\nAnd that could prohibit on some of\nthis communication that's involved for\n\n253\n00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:25.823\nthat underpinning sink discovery and that\ncommunication that's required to establish\n\n254\n00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:29.240\nthat synchronization between\nour server and our client.\n\n255\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.450\n&gt;&gt; And now, Cherokee, you're mentioning\nthat for a very specific reason as well.\n\n256\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.760\nYou might find this happening especially\nin a virtualized lab environment,\n\n257\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.730\nin which the machines are spun up as you\nactually say I'm gonna run this lab.\n\n258\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.100\nSo when they do so, you might find that\nthe network adapter ends up attaching\n\n259\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.340\nitself or generating and\nthinks at the very beginning.\n\n260\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.110\nNobody's logging in, let me go ahead and\nput it into the public profile\n\n261\n00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.640\ninstead of actually the domain profile and\nthat could cause issues.\n\n262\n00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.250\nSo in this particular environment,\nit may do that.\n\n263\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.170\nSo if it is, make sure you look up how to\nchange the network profile to something\n\n264\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.230\nlike private or the domain authenticated\nand see what happens from there.\n\n265\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.930\nThat should fix the issue.\n\n266\n00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.500\nDon't be frustrated by that.\n\n267\n00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.250\nIt's stuff that you'll run\ninto that's real common\n\n268\n00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.970\neven in a production environment.\n\n269\n00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.970\nSo at least here you'll know,\n\n270\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.080\nif you're trying to run the practice labs,\nyou may run into that as well.\n\n271\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.197\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, remember firewall, we're\nalways thinking most restrictive there.\n\n272\n00:15:20.197 --> 00:15:23.602\nAnd [LAUGH] in a lab environment,\nsometimes I've even seen on forms,\n\n273\n00:15:23.602 --> 00:15:26.902\npeople say just disable that\nfirewall to get things running.\n\n274\n00:15:26.902 --> 00:15:28.317\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Never,\n\n275\n00:15:28.317 --> 00:15:31.740\nnever do that in a production\nenvironment though.\n\n276\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.107\nYeah it's a little bit more of a headache\nto figure out exactly what holes we need\n\n277\n00:15:36.107 --> 00:15:37.945\nto punch through that firewall.\n\n278\n00:15:37.945 --> 00:15:39.609\nBut it's there for a reason right?\n\n279\n00:15:39.609 --> 00:15:42.372\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So all right, let's go ahead and\n\n280\n00:15:42.372 --> 00:15:46.798\ncheck on this client to verify that all of\nour hard work is actually successful here.\n\n281\n00:15:46.798 --> 00:15:51.408\nIf we pull up File Explorer and simply\ntype in workfolders into this bar right\n\n282\n00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:55.600\nhere because we went through all\nthat trouble to make it really easy.\n\n283\n00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.706\nAnd just type in workfolders,\nso let's go ahead and do that.\n\n284\n00:15:57.706 --> 00:16:01.675\nSo workfolders and we'll hit Enter Now\nbecause we've never had this\n\n285\n00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:05.723\nset up before, this is our first time,\nwe need to go ahead and do that.\n\n286\n00:16:05.723 --> 00:16:07.742\nSo they provide a little hyperlink for us.\n\n287\n00:16:07.742 --> 00:16:12.276\nAnd this'll launch, well first of all,\nin order to actually get this set up,\n\n288\n00:16:12.276 --> 00:16:15.040\nremember we have to input\nour e-mail address.\n\n289\n00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.968\nAnd we had already specified that for\nour administrator previously, so\n\n290\n00:16:17.968 --> 00:16:19.699\nthat's what I'm gonna use here to log in.\n\n291\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.392\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee is doing this\non that Windows 8 machine.\n\n292\n00:16:24.392 --> 00:16:29.630\nSo on any client you test out, right,\nyou should be able to gain access to this.\n\n293\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.113\nAnd here Cherokee's just using\nthe e-mail address to verify\n\n294\n00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:36.880\nbecause that's how she had set it up.\n\n295\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.179\n&gt;&gt; And then we'll select Next.\n\n296\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.170\n&gt;&gt; Hey, look at that, cool.\n\n297\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.224\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nsometimes it takes a few moments and\n\n298\n00:16:43.224 --> 00:16:45.580\nyou'll see a little green\nbar scrolling past.\n\n299\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.470\nBut for now, that'll work for us.\n\n300\n00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.750\nSo this is just introduction screen,\nand then you're gonna go through.\n\n301\n00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.852\nAnd remember that when we set that up,\nwe had the ability to pick and\n\n302\n00:16:56.852 --> 00:17:00.750\nselect certain options for\nthe end user to comply with.\n\n303\n00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:05.270\nSo they are going to be introduced\nto those security policies.\n\n304\n00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.783\nAnd just to make sure that they\nunderstand what they're getting into,\n\n305\n00:17:08.783 --> 00:17:11.887\nhow their data will be handled,\nwhat that expectation is, and\n\n306\n00:17:11.887 --> 00:17:15.670\nthen they have the option to go ahead and\ncomply and accept these policies.\n\n307\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.768\nSo here, if you recall, we said we\nwere gonna encrypt those work folders,\n\n308\n00:17:19.768 --> 00:17:24.340\nrequire a password to sign into your PC,\nand then automatically lock your screen.\n\n309\n00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.613\nAnd then we also have the ability\nto erase all files and\n\n310\n00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.660\nwork folders if you lose this PC.\n\n311\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.350\nSo just as long as they know about that.\n\n312\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.830\nAnd then set up work folders.\n\n313\n00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.970\nSo pretty easy walk through there.\n\n314\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.390\n&gt;&gt; Now, actually that last string\nthat we take a look at there.\n\n315\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:49.209\nCherokee, it's actually important that\nthe end user understand that we have\n\n316\n00:17:49.209 --> 00:17:52.933\nthis ability, right,\nto essentially erase the product and\n\n317\n00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:55.430\nthat work folder if they need to.\n\n318\n00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.170\nMost of the time,\nthey don't understand this.\n\n319\n00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.890\nAnd they might go, why did all of\nthe sudden something disappear?\n\n320\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.410\nWell, normally we have to actually protect\non something like this if they happen to\n\n321\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.680\nlose that laptop or whatever it might be.\n\n322\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.146\nOr the very fact that file might not\nactually be allowed to be outside of\n\n323\n00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:11.330\nthe workplace.\n\n324\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.621\nSo this is something that we\nshould inform them about and\n\n325\n00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:16.070\nkind of make sure that they\nunderstand what's happening.\n\n326\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.720\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely Ron, especially for\nthat sensitive information.\n\n327\n00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n328\n00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.997\n&gt;&gt; Now because this is the first time\nI've set this up under this account and\n\n329\n00:18:22.997 --> 00:18:26.500\nwe don't have documents already\nsitting there on our file server,\n\n330\n00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.930\nthat was a relatively fast process.\n\n331\n00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.970\nHowever, Ronnie, if I had maybe\nthis was my third device and\n\n332\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.902\nI already had a lot of data that had been\nsitting there on that file server, this\n\n333\n00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:39.980\nprocess would take a little bit longer, so\njust kind of keep that in mind as well.\n\n334\n00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.138\nSo this is just stating that that\nsynchronization process has begun, but\n\n335\n00:18:44.138 --> 00:18:48.910\nbecause I don't have anything in there you\ncan see, it kind of popped up real quick.\n\n336\n00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.330\nI had 0 bytes.\n\n337\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.242\nOkay and then it switched over\nto my default max here for\n\n338\n00:18:54.242 --> 00:18:56.210\napproximately 30 gigs.\n\n339\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.855\nSo that's one way you can set\nmanagement as far as quota and knowing,\n\n340\n00:19:00.855 --> 00:19:04.720\nunderstanding how much per\nuser storage that they have.\n\n341\n00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.900\nNow, let's see.\n\n342\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.656\nLet me just put,\n\n343\n00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:10.340\nnow all you would have to do is save your\ninformation to this work folder section.\n\n344\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.760\nSo let me select New, and let's just use\na text document, and we'll say testdoc.\n\n345\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.366\nAnd move that on over to\nmy work folders here.\n\n346\n00:19:21.366 --> 00:19:26.062\nAll right, and one thing I wanted to\npoint out to you guys because we had\n\n347\n00:19:26.062 --> 00:19:28.370\nselected to encrypt those files,\n\n348\n00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:33.120\nyou do see that the name of that\nfile has turned from black to green.\n\n349\n00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.264\nSo that's just showing you the EFS,\n\n350\n00:19:35.264 --> 00:19:39.910\nthat encryption happening there right\nintegrated into our work folder setup.\n\n351\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.394\nThat's about it, Ronnie.\n\n352\n00:19:41.394 --> 00:19:42.940\nI mean it's pretty simple\non the client's side.\n\n353\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.580\nWe've already done all\nof the work previously.\n\n354\n00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.757\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, well thank you\nagain for helping us to make sure that we\n\n355\n00:19:49.757 --> 00:19:54.601\nunderstand the steps and the configuration\nof work folders, getting the certificate\n\n356\n00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:59.042\nauthority set up, making sure that we\nhave the proper certificate to hand out,\n\n357\n00:19:59.042 --> 00:20:01.660\nsetting up the work folder\non the server side.\n\n358\n00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.561\nRemember that if you are running a proxy,\nyou've gotta go in those group policy\n\n359\n00:20:05.561 --> 00:20:08.430\nsettings, make sure you get\nthat set up the way we need to.\n\n360\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.380\nAll that's actually gonna be a very\nimportant part of what we have here to do.\n\n361\n00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.079\nSo make sure you watch these episodes a\ncouple of times because there are a lot of\n\n362\n00:20:16.079 --> 00:20:18.937\nsteps, but you do see that the end\nuser is fairly seamless and\n\n363\n00:20:18.937 --> 00:20:21.650\nactually is easy for\nthem to get started in work folders.\n\n364\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.480\nWell that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n365\n00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.170\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n366\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:28.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n367\n00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.630\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n368\n00:20:34.682 --> 00:20:40.497\n[MUSIC]\n\n369\n00:20:40.497 --> 00:20:43.857\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.249\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:17.152\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode here\non ITProTV you're watching the MCSA for\n\n5\n00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:19.560\nWindows Server 2012 r2.\n\n6\n00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.236\nWe're specifically taking\na look at exam 70-410 and\n\n7\n00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:27.240\ntoday's topic though is\nactually gonna be a part six.\n\n8\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.830\nTalking about the idea of file and\nof course folder access here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.090\nAnd here to help us out in this part\nsix is gonna be Cherokee Boose herself.\n\n10\n00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.470\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.510\nHow are you today?\n\n13\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.140\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n14\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.140\nNow Cherokee here we are.\n\n15\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.930\nWe are in a part six which is for\nour sake here unprecedented.\n\n16\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.360\nSo Cherokee,\nwhat do we really have left to go over?\n\n17\n00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.642\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, we actually have three\ntechnologies left because we were just\n\n18\n00:00:50.642 --> 00:00:53.130\nkind of wrapping up our file and\nshare access, so\n\n19\n00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.220\nwe'll just piggyback off of that.\n\n20\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.150\nA lot of the concepts we've already\ntalked about, you probably already know.\n\n21\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.690\nSo we'll just expand upon that because\nreally that's a pretty big task when we\n\n22\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.370\ntalk about different types\nof things that a network or\n\n23\n00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.480\nsystem admin is responsible for.\n\n24\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.470\nThey have to make sure that\nthat information is stored and\n\n25\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.150\nmanaged appropriately.\n\n26\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.020\nSo the first thing we'll talk\nabout is something called\n\n27\n00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.900\nVolume Shadow Service or VSS.\n\n28\n00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.580\nAnd if we take a look at my screen,\n\n29\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.670\nI'd like to share with you just\nthe simple TechNet page here.\n\n30\n00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.780\nVSS is actually an underpinning\ntechnology that's associated\n\n31\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.580\nwith other services such as,\nlet me zoom in and you can see this.\n\n32\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.680\nWhoa, not that far.\n\n33\n00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.650\nWe've got Windows Backup Server\nutilizes components with VSS.\n\n34\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.210\nWe will skip this one because we're\ngonna be talking about this one.\n\n35\n00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.160\nWe've got System Center Data\nProtection Manager, System Restore.\n\n36\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.290\nBut according to the objectives, and since\nwe're talking about file and share access.\n\n37\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.680\nThis is where we are really going to\nbe focusing in on is going to be shadow\n\n38\n00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.800\ncopies of shared folders.\n\n39\n00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.970\nSo you guys can find\nthat information online.\n\n40\n00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.300\nBut we'll just kind of talk about it and\nexplain what it is and\n\n41\n00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.390\nwhy we would wanna use it.\n\n42\n00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.400\nAs a matter of fact, Ronnie,\nbecause we are working here in a part six,\n\n43\n00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.200\nI was a little bit confused cuz I\nnormally don't get to a part six, and\n\n44\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.910\nI thought I was at a earlier show.\n\n45\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.630\nAnd so the file name when I\nwas typing up my notes for\n\n46\n00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.060\nthe show, I think I overwrote them.\n\n47\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.010\nI'll have to check on that, but what\nhappens if you do overwrite some files.\n\n48\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.120\nOr if some files are accidentally deleted,\n\n49\n00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.900\nI mean people make mistakes all the time,\nright.\n\n50\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650\nSo that's exactly what\nVSS was created for,\n\n51\n00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.100\nwas to go back to\na previous point in time,\n\n52\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.280\nprevious version of a particular file,\nand let us access it in that way.\n\n53\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.850\nSo let's see, let me just pull\nup some considerations here.\n\n54\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.438\nGot a couple different\nthings going on there.\n\n55\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.130\nIs that the right screen?\n\n56\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.290\nNope there we go, all right..\n\n57\n00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.810\nThere are some things to consider\nwhen we're talking about VSS.\n\n58\n00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.780\nMicrosoft recommends to store\nshadow copies on a separate disk.\n\n59\n00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.980\nSo if I have a lot of IO\non that particular drive.\n\n60\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.320\nIt would just be better if I could\noffset that to a separate disk for\n\n61\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.470\nperformance optimization.\n\n62\n00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.000\nNow we'll see this when we walk\nthrough the actual steps here.\n\n63\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.620\nBut this particular back up,\nit's a type of back up it's not a back up.\n\n64\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.100\nSo let me be clear on my terminology here.\n\n65\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.630\nBut this process can be\nprocessor intensive.\n\n66\n00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.990\nSo, we don't want to be\ntrying to back up or\n\n67\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.390\ncreate our shadows during\na time of high utilization.\n\n68\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.620\nSo, we wanna adjust the schedule\nto fit our organization's needs.\n\n69\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.140\nThat's pretty important there.\n\n70\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.420\nNow by default,VSS is scheduled to\nrun 7:00 AM Monday through Friday.\n\n71\n00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.500\nSo I think Microsoft was assuming, hey,\n\n72\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.630\nthat's probably before\nmost companies start.\n\n73\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.160\nBut if you have an unusual schedule,\nor if you just wanna change it,\n\n74\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.650\nthen you also have the option\nto do that as well.\n\n75\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.080\nAll right, it's also recommended to not\nenable shadow copies on volumes using\n\n76\n00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.350\nmount points.\n\n77\n00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.910\nAnd that's going by what\nMicrosoft recommends.\n\n78\n00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.090\nAnd it's not that you can't,\nbut the mount points create,\n\n79\n00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.600\nkind of like if you think about, we've\ntalked about permissions and inheritance,\n\n80\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.110\nand how that propagation filters downward.\n\n81\n00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.200\nAnd if you have mount points\ninside of a mount point,\n\n82\n00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.650\nthen it kind of stops that propagation,\nand it can just be unusual or\n\n83\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.509\ncause strange anomalies or problems,\nthat's why they recommend not using it.\n\n84\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.980\nNow, note here,\nthis is not a replacement for backups.\n\n85\n00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.940\nThis is a good enhancement or\nit works well with backups.\n\n86\n00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.730\nReally good for quick access, easy access\n\n87\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.000\nwithout having to pull in an entire\nbackup or get IT involved.\n\n88\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.350\nSo its pretty simple in that way but\nit's not a replacement.\n\n89\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.450\nAnd there is also a note here,\n\n90\n00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.030\ndo not schedule copies to occur\nmore often than once per hour.\n\n91\n00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.000\nSo here is the thing,\n\n92\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.560\nwhen we're setting these up you'll see\nthat we have the ability to select\n\n93\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.250\nthe amount of storage that is\ngoing to be utilized with VSS.\n\n94\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.230\nBecause when we enable VSS on a per\nvolume level, we have to think\n\n95\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.690\nabout the additional storage because we're\nreally saving copies of all of our work.\n\n96\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.958\nSo we have to accommodate with\nthe storage but here's the deal.\n\n97\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:43.740\nIf I have more than adequate storage,\n\n98\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:50.270\nthe software will only allow up to\n64 versions of a particular file.\n\n99\n00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.920\nSo, if I schedule VSS to run every hour,\n\n100\n00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.600\nI'm potentially harming myself\nby reducing the history.\n\n101\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.910\nOkay, going back in time, if they're\njust continually I could hit that 64.\n\n102\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.650\nAnd, then what happens then is the older\n\n103\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.476\ncopies will start to delete\nas the new ones come in.\n\n104\n00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:13.000\nSo just kind of be aware of that.\n\n105\n00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.990\nAlso you just wanna kind of check\nbefore deleting a volume that is being\n\n106\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.530\nshadow copied, delete the scheduled\ntask for creating shadow copies.\n\n107\n00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.790\nAnd the reason being is you would receive,\n\n108\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.910\nI think it's like an error 1700 and\nit'll just fill your log.\n\n109\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.820\nOtherwise, it's not gonna\ncause any kind of instability.\n\n110\n00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.660\nBut you just want to be cognizant\nof those error logs there.\n\n111\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.520\nNow there are a few things to note here.\n\n112\n00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.880\nIt is important to use\nan allocation unit size.\n\n113\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.638\nAnd we're talking about our hard\ndisk drive configuration with\n\n114\n00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.037\nthe formatting there.\n\n115\n00:06:47.037 --> 00:06:50.550\n16KB or\nlarger when formatting a source volume.\n\n116\n00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.700\nThere are some issues with compression.\n\n117\n00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.570\nCompression I think they max it at 4KB.\n\n118\n00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.630\nAnd that has to do with the way\ndisk defragmentor works.\n\n119\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.802\nAnd some of those older copies\ncan be corrupt if you don't at\n\n120\n00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:13.090\nleast pay attention to that\n16KB recommendation as well.\n\n121\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.770\nNow, there's also another thing\nto note here at the very bottom,\n\n122\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.030\nit says, after backing up a volume\nthat contains shadow copies,\n\n123\n00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.280\ndo not restore the volume to a different\nvolume on the same computer.\n\n124\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.680\nSo what that means is you can restore to\n\n125\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.690\nthe same volume on that computer or\na separate computer.\n\n126\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.650\nBut don't restore to a different\nvolume on the same computer.\n\n127\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.930\nYou'll have discrepancies and\npotential corruption there as well.\n\n128\n00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.110\nSo now that we've talked about what\nVSS is, let's go ahead and set it up.\n\n129\n00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.260\nIt's pretty easy.\n\n130\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.519\nLet me just pull up my lab here.\n\n131\n00:07:58.317 --> 00:08:02.431\nOkay, so on my domain controller Let's\njust verify we've got a connection here,\n\n132\n00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:05.770\nall right,\nthat's my lab making sure it's connected.\n\n133\n00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:14.015\nSo what I've done is I've set a, hold on\nlet me just move this around a little bit.\n\n134\n00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:20.010\nOkay, I have set a folder and the folder\nif we take a look on my C drive here,\n\n135\n00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.200\nthe folder that we wanna work with\nus called shownotes, all right?\n\n136\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.740\nAnd, because this is\na per volume technology,\n\n137\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.930\nand I only have one volume configured\non this drive, my C drive.\n\n138\n00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:38.010\nSo what I need to do I need to enable\n\n139\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.780\nthis on a per volume level, so right-click\nand then I select Configure Shadow Copies.\n\n140\n00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.790\nAnd let me zoom out so\nyou can see that a little bit.\n\n141\n00:08:49.144 --> 00:08:51.140\nCurrently, I can see that it's disabled.\n\n142\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.120\nYou can also see the numbers of\nshares that are listed here.\n\n143\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.980\nSo, I have that show notes share,\nI have my administrative shares, and\n\n144\n00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.290\nfrom there, I will select Enable.\n\n145\n00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:08.360\nAll right, so whenever we,\nthis is just the information page.\n\n146\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.960\nIt's kinda of telling us what VSS is or\nour shadow copy is here.\n\n147\n00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.990\nAnd it says,\ndo you wanna enable shadow copies?\n\n148\n00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.059\nAnd we're gonna select, Yes.\n\n149\n00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:24.229\nFrom this particular screen I have\nthe ability, give it a second here and\n\n150\n00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:25.860\nit will go ahead and turn that on.\n\n151\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.275\nIt'll create one automatically,\nyou see that right there.\n\n152\n00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:31.270\nNow, if I wanted to create more, I could.\n\n153\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.600\nAs a matter of fact, let's do that.\n\n154\n00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.890\nLet's create a file inside of shownotes.\n\n155\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:42.370\nSo let's just select new and\nwe'll just do a text document here.\n\n156\n00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.821\nOops, not that one.\n\n157\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.930\nAnd we'll just say, TestDoc.\n\n158\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.110\nAnd let's add something\nto this document so\n\n159\n00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.170\nwe can actually see who\nthat versioning works.\n\n160\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.191\nSo inside of our TestDoc,\nlet's just type in original.\n\n161\n00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:08.900\nSo we can type,\nthis is our original document.\n\n162\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.680\nAnd let's go ahead and\nsave that, all right?\n\n163\n00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.980\nRight there inside of shownotes.\n\n164\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.100\nAnd now I just created one copy,\nlet's create another copy here,\n\n165\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.740\nso you just select,\nI can move that over, maybe it'll.\n\n166\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.250\nYou select this option right\nhere to go ahead and create now.\n\n167\n00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.390\nAnd you can force this\nshadow copy to happen.\n\n168\n00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.260\nNow we can also set up\nour schedule as well, so\n\n169\n00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.539\nwe'll take a look at that as\nsoon as this is finished here.\n\n170\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.966\nAnd again, because this is enabled on a\nper volume basis, you do have to be aware\n\n171\n00:10:45.966 --> 00:10:50.770\nof how many files are on that volume and\nhow much storage you have on that volume.\n\n172\n00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.470\nSo, that's definitely a consideration.\n\n173\n00:10:54.097 --> 00:10:58.753\nOkay, so here I have the ability\nto note which volume I'm\n\n174\n00:10:58.753 --> 00:11:02.750\ngoing to be creating the shadow copy on.\n\n175\n00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.380\nThe storage area, for instance,\n\n176\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.280\nif I wanted to save\nthe actual copies elsewhere.\n\n177\n00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.710\nNow I currently have a limitation here,\nso that's in megabytes.\n\n178\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:18.440\nI could set it to no limit if I had\na large significant amount of storage.\n\n179\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.200\nBut just keep in mind that we are still\ngoing to have that 64 copy limitation.\n\n180\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.500\nIf I click on schedule, this is where\nI can go ahead, and you can see that\n\n181\n00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.740\nthe default here is that 7 AM every\nMonday, Tuesday, so Monday through Friday.\n\n182\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.070\nAnd you have the option on the weekends,\n\n183\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.070\nyou can even have some\nadvanced features here.\n\n184\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.050\nSo, repeat the tasks, set it in date.\n\n185\n00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:49.345\nBut you should, I think, either morning or\nafternoon but it really just depends on\n\n186\n00:11:49.345 --> 00:11:52.835\nyour organization just as long as there's\nnot a lot of read and writes happening.\n\n187\n00:11:52.835 --> 00:11:56.505\nBut the cool thing is that\nvolume shadow service does\n\n188\n00:11:56.505 --> 00:12:00.240\nwork if that particular file is open,\nso that's kind of neat as well.\n\n189\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.126\nAll right, we'll just hit OK,\n\n190\n00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:09.180\nand OK, and OK.\n\n191\n00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:18.090\nNow, if I wanted to right click or let me\njust open this and let's change something.\n\n192\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.200\nSo we'll just say modification or\nwe'll just say modified or mod, all right?\n\n193\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.100\nIf I can type there.\n\n194\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.895\nAll right, so now let's go ahead and\nhit File &gt; Save.\n\n195\n00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:33.494\nIf I right-click on the properties for\nthis particular document,\n\n196\n00:12:33.494 --> 00:12:35.840\nI'll see an additional tab here.\n\n197\n00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.780\nThis tab is not available,\n\n198\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.050\nit is not present,\nunless a VSS is enabled for that volume.\n\n199\n00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.921\nSo because it is, I have the option\nto look at the different versions.\n\n200\n00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:52.656\nSo let's go ahead and let's see,\n\n201\n00:12:52.656 --> 00:12:56.911\ndouble click that and zoom in.\n\n202\n00:12:56.911 --> 00:13:01.192\nAnd we can see here that that previous\nversion was the original document.\n\n203\n00:13:01.192 --> 00:13:04.926\nSo you could see how helpful\nthis could be if, for instance,\n\n204\n00:13:04.926 --> 00:13:08.600\nyou overwrote your shownotes or\nsomething to that nature.\n\n205\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.460\nPeople make mistakes all the time.\n\n206\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.410\nIt's a great utility.\n\n207\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.630\nVSS can be enabled on a per DFS for\n\n208\n00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.485\ndistributed file system namespace if you\nhave a lot of shares in your environment.\n\n209\n00:13:21.485 --> 00:13:23.810\nThen you may have that DFS set up.\n\n210\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.680\nIt would just create a bit of\na performance decrease for\n\n211\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.900\nthose responses because\nthere's a lot going on there.\n\n212\n00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.110\nBut it's a pretty cool feature overall.\n\n213\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.840\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nwhat happens if I modify this again?\n\n214\n00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.720\nI already got my volume shadow copy, what\nwill happen to the one that's in there?\n\n215\n00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.750\n&gt;&gt; So unless if I modify it again,\nif I save, then it'll go ahead and\n\n216\n00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.760\ncreate a copy.\n\n217\n00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.260\nIf I just have it sitting there, I would\nhave to wait until 7 AM that next morning.\n\n218\n00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.380\nSo that is something you do wanna,\ndon't use it as a replacement for\n\n219\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.410\nactually saving your work.\n\n220\n00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:01.560\nYou still wanna go through that\nmanual save or save as function.\n\n221\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.350\nOtherwise you'll just follow that\nnormal schedule if you don't\n\n222\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.780\ninitiate it through other means, so.\n\n223\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.400\n&gt;&gt; So if we open up that document right\nthere and we make another change,\n\n224\n00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.100\nit's not gonna create another\nprevious version that's there?\n\n225\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n226\n00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.570\nLet's just say, second change.\n\n227\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.470\nBut, not if I just let it sit here.\n\n228\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.249\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I'd have to manually say, File &gt; Save.\n\n229\n00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:32.735\nSecond change, and\nthen if we right click and\n\n230\n00:14:32.735 --> 00:14:37.977\ngo back into our Properties, and\ncheck out our previous versions.\n\n231\n00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:44.056\nAll right,\nwe've got our original document.\n\n232\n00:14:44.056 --> 00:14:50.710\nSo not unless I create,\nI thought it would do that automatically,\n\n233\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:56.365\nbut what we would need to do then is to go\nahead and actually create a restore point.\n\n234\n00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:56.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n235\n00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.570\n&gt;&gt; Or create a copy there,\nlike we did previously.\n\n236\n00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.670\nNow that brings up another concept\nhere of the open copy versus restore.\n\n237\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.740\nBecause if you just open it,\nyou're viewing it, you may wanna\n\n238\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.680\ncompare before you actually pull that\nitem in and perform the restoration.\n\n239\n00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.850\nAnd then you also have\nthe ability to do a copy there.\n\n240\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.770\nSo you just wanna make sure you're\nworking with the right one.\n\n241\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:21.388\nLet's see it.\n\n242\n00:15:21.388 --> 00:15:26.458\nSo if we go back to our C drive here and\nconfigure shadow copies,\n\n243\n00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:30.093\nwe could hit create now, and then, Ronnie,\n\n244\n00:15:30.093 --> 00:15:34.801\nwe would have our third version\nof that shadow copy there.\n\n245\n00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:37.051\nSo it'll just take a few seconds so, yep.\n\n246\n00:15:37.051 --> 00:15:40.013\nAll right, so\nnot by automatically saving it but\n\n247\n00:15:40.013 --> 00:15:43.570\nby creating it within\nthe shadow copy option.\n\n248\n00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.407\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Cherokee, we wanted to\npoint out a few things here when you take\n\n249\n00:15:47.407 --> 00:15:50.199\na look at the properties especially for\nunderstanding,\n\n250\n00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.186\nhow do people get access to that\nif they were to restore this?\n\n251\n00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:56.411\nOn the exam, you may end up facing\nsomething over the screen that\n\n252\n00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:59.458\nlooks exactly like that where\nthey put out the properties and\n\n253\n00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.983\nthen asking you, which particular\ntab that you might need to select So\n\n254\n00:16:02.983 --> 00:16:04.977\nthat you can restore that shadow copy.\n\n255\n00:16:04.977 --> 00:16:09.621\nOr, if you need to make a copy of that\nparticular copy that you have available\n\n256\n00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:10.600\nto you.\n\n257\n00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.940\nAnd, these are things that we wanted\nto make sure that we pointed out and\n\n258\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.090\nthat we emphasize.\n\n259\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.170\nCherokee also demonstrates\nto use something,\n\n260\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:20.490\nwhich we may actually have to take a look\nat in the way that we've got it configured\n\n261\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.540\nin terms of volume shadow copy.\n\n262\n00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.150\nWhere we might think it just continues\nto create multiple copies for us.\n\n263\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.590\nBut she just showed you, as she saved it,\nit didn't seem to actually save it yet.\n\n264\n00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.500\nSo you have to actually be careful there,\ntoo, thinking that it might be there, but\n\n265\n00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.990\nit may not as well.\n\n266\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.200\nSo those are all good things for\n\n267\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.320\nus to consider as we start to take\na look at volume shadow copy.\n\n268\n00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.760\n&gt;&gt; They really are Ronnie, and\nthank you for calling that out.\n\n269\n00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.320\nAlso, there's one other way,\n\n270\n00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.460\nlike Ronnie was mentioning, they wanna\nmake sure you know how to access it.\n\n271\n00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.590\nSo let me just show you another\nway you can easily get to those\n\n272\n00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.150\nshadow copy properties.\n\n273\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.375\nSo you can get there through computer\nmanagement, and you can either access it\n\n274\n00:16:56.375 --> 00:17:00.240\nvia server manager or just by\nright-clicking on the Start screen here.\n\n275\n00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.740\nAnd then once you pull up\nComputer Management here,\n\n276\n00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.360\nit'll be over on the left hand\npane under Disk Management.\n\n277\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.430\nAnd then you can right-click,\nand I'm pretty sure, hold on.\n\n278\n00:17:13.762 --> 00:17:16.460\nRight-click on All Tasks,\nand let me zoom in here.\n\n279\n00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.040\nAt the very bottom it says\nConfigure Shadow Copies, so\n\n280\n00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.040\nthat's just another way to access\nit if you didn't want to use that,\n\n281\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.985\njust right clicking on\nthe volume itself also.\n\n282\n00:17:27.205 --> 00:17:32.225\nThere's also something else, instead\nof using the command line interface you\n\n283\n00:17:32.225 --> 00:17:38.955\nhave the ability to manage VSS\nvia the VSSadmin.exe utility.\n\n284\n00:17:38.955 --> 00:17:44.321\nAnd I will show you the commands for\nthat, they're going to be listed here.\n\n285\n00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:49.033\nAnd what you would do is you would\njust open it and administrative\n\n286\n00:17:49.033 --> 00:17:54.022\ncommand prompt and go ahead and\ntype in your VSS admin list writers.\n\n287\n00:17:54.022 --> 00:17:57.877\nAnd you might want to use this\ncommand line utility for additional\n\n288\n00:17:57.877 --> 00:18:02.871\nconfigurations, especially if you wanted\nto check and verify that those writers.\n\n289\n00:18:02.871 --> 00:18:07.127\nAnd a writer is just gonna be\nthe technology that's actually performing\n\n290\n00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:11.661\nthe writing, so that backing up concept,\nto make sure that they are actually\n\n291\n00:18:11.661 --> 00:18:16.230\nperforming the way you want them to,\nand to really granularlly manage that.\n\n292\n00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.390\nSo this would be the kind of insight\nthat you would use with that\n\n293\n00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.760\nVSS admin.exe utility.\n\n294\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:28.920\nAnd I see here it was event 7001 for\nthat, if you left that schedule running,\n\n295\n00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.770\nnot 1700, so\nI just want to throw that out there.\n\n296\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.180\nYou know Ronnie, I think that's about\nit for VSS but we still have a couple\n\n297\n00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.150\ndifferent technologies that we need to\ntalk about for our file and share access.\n\n298\n00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.830\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n299\n00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.090\nthat sounds like a lot of information on\nvolume shadow copy and there's a lot of\n\n300\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.570\nneat things but it is a little bit\nhefty on trying to remember all that.\n\n301\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.360\nSo Cherokee,\nbefore we move onto a newer technology, or\n\n302\n00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.000\nanother technology I should say.\n\n303\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.980\nLet's go ahead and, if you don't mind,\njust do a kind of short summary or\n\n304\n00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.400\nreview of some of the things\nthat we talked about right now.\n\n305\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie,\nit was a lot of information.\n\n306\n00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.350\nI think the most important\ntakeaway about VSS is that\n\n307\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:11.000\nit is never in any situation\na replacement for backups.\n\n308\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.710\nBecause I like to joke around, but it's\nreally not a funny matter whenever we say\n\n309\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:19.330\nthat having your back-ups be incorrect or\n\n310\n00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.690\nnot work properly, or you haven't tested,\ntested that restoration process.\n\n311\n00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.541\nThat is what we call\nthat resume generating\n\n312\n00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:27.453\nevent-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:19:27.453 --> 00:19:28.350\n&gt;&gt; An RGE.\n\n314\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:33.834\nBecause that's fully not something\nthat a lot of managers or\n\n315\n00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:37.550\nupper management can really look past.\n\n316\n00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:43.320\nIt's something that you or I could have\nprevented and it was just negligence.\n\n317\n00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.730\nSo I think that's number one.\n\n318\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.830\nAnd then number two, I'm not gonna\ngo in to a specific order there.\n\n319\n00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.910\nBut there are a lot of things,\nlike you had said.\n\n320\n00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.210\nYou do want to make sure that it's not\naffecting any kind of performance.\n\n321\n00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.110\nSo you want to check that schedule.\n\n322\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.820\nYou may want to select\na complete different disk\n\n323\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.000\nto create that storage to\nshare those copies on.\n\n324\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.060\nAnd just making sure your disk\n\n325\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.750\nhas been configured with\nthe appropriate allocation unit size.\n\n326\n00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.350\nAnd then if you were to perform an entire\nrestoration, a volume restoration,\n\n327\n00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.380\nyou wanna make sure that you're not\npulling that in on a separate volume on\n\n328\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.140\nthe same computer because of\nthose discrepancies there.\n\n329\n00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.800\nSo I think those are the biggest point,\nbut\n\n330\n00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.330\nof course,\nnumber one being those backups there.\n\n331\n00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.030\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt Cherokee that\nwhat were gonna end up seeing,\n\n332\n00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:31.050\nespecially on the exam is, because this\nis such a simple technology to build,\n\n333\n00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:35.070\nset up, and configure, and it can work\nvery easily without us thinking about it.\n\n334\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.390\nThat you do need to pay attention\nto those smaller steps and\n\n335\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.630\nunderstand how do you verify\nthat volume shadow copy is on?\n\n336\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.260\nHow do you know that it\nis actually scheduled?\n\n337\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.920\nWhere do you go to do\na restore when you need to?\n\n338\n00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.490\nThose are all elements that, in the past,\nthey've actually kind of questioned us on.\n\n339\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.370\nAnd you need to be able to go, all right,\nthis is exactly what I would be able\n\n340\n00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.840\nto do and\nwhere I would go to know how to do that.\n\n341\n00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.210\nIf you were asked to set up the volume\nshadow copy on a different volume,\n\n342\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.020\nknowing those types of elements\nare also gonna be key.\n\n343\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.930\nNot difficult, but\njust a lot of little pieces there.\n\n344\n00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.230\nNow, Cherokee,\nwe do have a few minutes left.\n\n345\n00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.733\nBut I think this is a good point for\nus to go ahead and end this episode.\n\n346\n00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:18.316\nAnd then take a look at some of the other\ntechnologies that are out there,\n\n347\n00:21:18.316 --> 00:21:21.452\nsuch as the idea of the axis based\nnumberation and NTFS quotas.\n\n348\n00:21:21.452 --> 00:21:25.080\nBut let's go ahead and\nsave that for another episode.\n\n349\n00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:30.230\nAll right everybody, well, signing off for\nITPRO.TV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n350\n00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n351\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.545\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the NCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n352\n00:21:35.545 -->

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:14.664\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:19.390\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n6\n00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.196\nWe're specifically diving into,\nof course, exam 70-410.\n\n7\n00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:27.550\nAnd we are in a part seven\nof a course file and\n\n8\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.300\naccess control to help us out here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.229\nAnd here to help us out is\ngonna be Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.532\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:34.600\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.597\nRonnie, I know it's been a little bit of\na journey here, but we are in a Part 7.\n\n13\n00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:41.984\nBut I think we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up our file and\n\n14\n00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:45.410\nshare access right here in Part 7, so.\n\n15\n00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.890\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good, that makes you shorter\nthan the Harry Potter series, so\n\n16\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.638\nwe'll be fine.\n\n17\n00:00:50.638 --> 00:00:53.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [SOUND] [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n18\n00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:57.570\nYeah, I don't know, I don't have\nwizards and all that cool stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.220\nBut I do have access based enumeration and\nthat's pretty cool too,\n\n20\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.890\nmaybe not as cool as magic.\n\n21\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.540\nBut we can go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.688\ntalk about that and\ntake a look at how we would configure it.\n\n23\n00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:15.050\nSo yeah, access-based enumeration\nis a method in which we can really\n\n24\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.830\nhide components or objects that end\nuser does not have permission to.\n\n25\n00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.895\n&gt;&gt; So it is like magic?\n\n26\n00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:24.105\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that what you're telling me?\n\n27\n00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:24.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is it?\n\n28\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah kind of, yeah so perfect,\n&gt;&gt; All right so Cherokee, again,\n\n29\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.270\nwhen we start talking about this\nidea of access based numeration then\n\n30\n00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.500\nexplain to us again the goal of why\nwe would choose to do some of that.\n\n31\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.440\nGive us scenario in which we might go hey,\nthat sounds cool, how do I get that done?\n\n32\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.550\nAnd the answer's gonna be\naccess-based enumeration.\n\n33\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.590\nSo what is the scenario?\n\n34\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so a scenario, let's see, maybe\nyou work in an industry that has any kind\n\n35\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.600\nof regulatory compliances where\nmaybe it has financial information,\n\n36\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.460\nor most everyone has a human\nresource department.\n\n37\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.240\nSo I think that's the scenario\nwe'll look at here today.\n\n38\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.560\nSo not only can we help protect\n\n39\n00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.470\ninformation on our organization by,\nlet's say we're\n\n40\n00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.760\nrestricting access to certain HR documents\nthat don't need to be seen by everyone.\n\n41\n00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.976\nSo not only are we protecting\nemployee information, but\n\n42\n00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:22.795\nwe're also streamlining the experience for\nthe end users as well.\n\n43\n00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:27.543\nBecause they don't have to sift through\nall the unnecessary components and files\n\n44\n00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:32.171\nand folders to find what it is they need\naccess to to perform their job function.\n\n45\n00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:36.906\nAnd really, if you think about it, it's\nkind of like we're utilizing the principle\n\n46\n00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:41.313\nleast privilege here, stating that we\nonly want to grant enough permission and\n\n47\n00:02:41.313 --> 00:02:44.910\nrights to our end users to\nperform those daily functions.\n\n48\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.060\nSo, it's a win win for everyone,\nit's not difficult to set up.\n\n49\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.130\nI think the most difficult part is\nsomething that we've already covered, and\n\n50\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.550\nthat would be our permissions,\nour share and NTFS permissions.\n\n51\n00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.750\nBecause once those are set,\n\n52\n00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.650\naccess based enumeration simply looks\nat those settings and then applies\n\n53\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.990\nthose restrictions according to the\nsettings that you've already configured.\n\n54\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.885\nSo that's about it, Ronnie.\n\n55\n00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:15.967\n&gt;&gt; All right so the overall benefit though\nto using the access based remuneration\n\n56\n00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:21.049\nthen, in what you're actually saying,\nis that for someone like me if I don't\n\n57\n00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.054\nhave access to it, it's prior better if\nI just don't even notice that in that\n\n58\n00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:30.832\nfile share that we might all share that\nthe folder is actually even there.\n\n59\n00:03:30.832 --> 00:03:32.590\nAnd that way I'm not curious about it.\n\n60\n00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.133\nI don't wonder what's actually in it.\n\n61\n00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.850\nI don't go digging through it.\n\n62\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.472\nAnd so, in this particular sense,\neven though we do have many people\n\n63\n00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:44.789\nsharing that same file server,\nand access to that same folder.\n\n64\n00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.217\nEven though we have one resource but\nwe can set those permissions and\n\n65\n00:03:48.217 --> 00:03:51.226\nthose settings up to that point\nwhere I'm even gonna try and\n\n66\n00:03:51.226 --> 00:03:54.860\nfigure out what's there because\nI don't even really see it.\n\n67\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly Ronnie so\n\n68\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.320\na lot of us will have centralized storage\nset up, we spoke about that as well.\n\n69\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.150\nIt's really a smart thing to do and\nit helps us, you know.\n\n70\n00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.780\nHelps us simplify the backup process, and\n\n71\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.990\nreally control where our users\nare storing information.\n\n72\n00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.500\nBut, if I have information in one area,\nwell what, like you said,\n\n73\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.810\nwhat if someone sees information?\n\n74\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.250\nAnd you think about it, I have kids,\nand sometimes it's almost like hey,\n\n75\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.610\nhe has one, when can I have one,\nand kind of things.\n\n76\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.550\nSo it's almost like an access envy.\n\n77\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.420\nAnd I hate to say it but\n\n78\n00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.800\nsometimes it's true that you may\nencounter that in a business environment.\n\n79\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.478\nAnd also just thinking about hey\nmaybe there's a folder that says\n\n80\n00:04:34.478 --> 00:04:39.960\n[LAUGH] I don't know any\nkind of lay off plans.\n\n81\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n82\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.120\nAnd so if some sees a photo that says\nlayoff plans and that can cause some\n\n83\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.480\nunsettling and some anxiety those types\nof feelings within your environment.\n\n84\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.687\nSo hopefully you guys don't have to deal\nwith that but who knows what it is you\n\n85\n00:04:53.687 --> 00:04:57.914\nare trying to just keep under laps for\nthe time being or something like that?\n\n86\n00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:00.710\n&gt;&gt; And that real scenario does happen,\nright?\n\n87\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.880\nYou end up going across a file that\nyou might have set all the NTFS\n\n88\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.190\npermissions up on.\n\n89\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.730\nAnd here it is, Cherokee goes, and\nshe says this folder says it's open.\n\n90\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.041\nShe looks into it and\nliterally the title, the file,\n\n91\n00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:19.479\nor the filename itself,\nsays list of future firings.\n\n92\n00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.426\nWell, that would be terrible to happen\nto come across something like that.\n\n93\n00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:26.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Especially if your\nname was on the list right.\n\n94\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.480\n&gt;&gt; Even if your name's not on the list,\nyou're curious.\n\n95\n00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n96\n00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.910\n&gt;&gt; And so in this particular instance,\n\n97\n00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.610\naccess based enumeration should\nhelp to prevent that cuz\n\n98\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.210\nhopefully I won't even see it\n&gt;&gt; In theory,\n\n99\n00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.058\nif I don't have the permissions to\nbe able to go in and do something.\n\n100\n00:05:40.058 --> 00:05:44.280\nAll right, so Cherokee, so\nnow that we understand the basis of this,\n\n101\n00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.290\nwhat is the set up that we have to do\nto make sure everything has gone on?\n\n102\n00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.965\nYou talked about NTFS permissions.\n\n103\n00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:51.055\nAnything else that we\nhave to get set up here?\n\n104\n00:05:51.055 --> 00:05:53.075\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n105\n00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:58.545\nNow there are some caveats because\nwhen we are talking about access, we\n\n106\n00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:02.255\nhave to think about well how are these end\nusers going to be accessing this resource?\n\n107\n00:06:02.255 --> 00:06:06.175\nSo we've already spoke upon how\nto set up our different sharers.\n\n108\n00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:10.337\nSo obviously we have to have some sharers\nin order to apply this restrictive,\n\n109\n00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:12.510\naccess-based numeration to.\n\n110\n00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.960\nSo we need to have shares, and remember\nhow there were several different ways that\n\n111\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.570\nwe could create and set up shares, those\ndifferent methods that we talked about?\n\n112\n00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.360\nWell, not every single one of those\nmethods rendered the same exact output,\n\n113\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.510\nor let me say the exact\nsame configuration style.\n\n114\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.600\nSo that concept applies here\nwith access-based enumeration.\n\n115\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.920\nLet me just show you a quick list\nhere of something that I have.\n\n116\n00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.830\nThis is going to be something to consider.\n\n117\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.860\nSo it depends on how you set\nthat share up, whether or\n\n118\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.360\nnot ABE is enabled by default or not.\n\n119\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.550\nSo when it is enabled by default, that's\ngonna be whenever you start your share,\n\n120\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.230\nusing the file sharing feature.\n\n121\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.910\nSo that's just a regular way that you\nwouldn't, and I'm kinda going off\n\n122\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.580\nthe screen here But it's just when you\nset it up through File Explorer, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.490\nNow when it's not enabled,\nyou might want to consider this.\n\n124\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.390\nIf I'm creating a share with the Share and\nStorage Management utility.\n\n125\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.230\nIf I'm using Advanced Sharing\noption in File Explorer.\n\n126\n00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.900\nRemember how we had that\nAdvanced Sharing button?\n\n127\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.270\nSo slight details like that,\n\n128\n00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.480\njust where you click to set up that\nshare will effect the default.\n\n129\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.820\nSetting here for ABE.\n\n130\n00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Cherokee, I just saw\nthis Share and Storage Management.\n\n131\n00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.250\nIs that supposed to be File and\n\n132\n00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.890\nStorage Management,\non the shared folders are created?\n\n133\n00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.630\nThat should be File and\nStorage Management.\n\n134\n00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the one that's falling off there.\n\n135\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.650\n&gt;&gt; No, right there on the middle\nof the screen where it said,\n\n136\n00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.670\nshared folders are created.\n\n137\n00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.730\nThat's supposed to be files, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.902\n&gt;&gt; For file and storage management, yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:37.902 --> 00:07:39.486\n&gt;&gt; I just wanted to make sure we\nwere in the right place, all right.\n\n140\n00:07:39.486 --> 00:07:41.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good looking out, Ronnie.\n\n141\n00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.248\nAlso let's think about, there's a couple\nother ones that we need to consider.\n\n142\n00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:47.870\nThat is going to be if we\nuse our net share command.\n\n143\n00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.235\nIf we use any kind of\nadministrative volumes that\n\n144\n00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:55.540\nwe're gonna be sharing out as well.\n\n145\n00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.514\nNow you can utilize access based\nenumeration across an entire distribution\n\n146\n00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:05.890\nfile system name space if you have a bunch\nof shares that you're managing via DFS.\n\n147\n00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.092\nSo that just may affect overall\nperformance slightly because there is some\n\n148\n00:08:10.092 --> 00:08:13.350\nadditional processing\nthat's involved with that.\n\n149\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.140\nBut I just wanted to throw that out there.\n\n150\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.920\nMy thing is, why don't you just check and\nit's easy to check\n\n151\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.740\nright here in Server Manager, so\nlet's let's go ahead and do that.\n\n152\n00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.873\nActually, let me show you what\nI have on this server first, so\n\n153\n00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:30.450\nthat we can see what we're working with.\n\n154\n00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.800\nSo, on my particular server,\nI have a human resource folder, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.280\nWe were talking about human resource,\nso let's just stick with that theme.\n\n156\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.780\nSo inside my human resource file,\n\n157\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.180\nI have some information here,\nI have a folder, of different resumes.\n\n158\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.830\nSo maybe potential new hires or\n\n159\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.560\neven current employees I would\nput their resumes right here.\n\n160\n00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.250\nNow, health providers,\nthis maybe a list of those providers that\n\n161\n00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.140\nare available within your network that's\nprovided by your company health insurance.\n\n162\n00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.770\nSo that's something that every\nemployee should have access to.\n\n163\n00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:08.393\nAs well as maybe PTO, personal time off\nforms, if you wanted to go on vacation or\n\n164\n00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:09.707\nsomething like that.\n\n165\n00:09:09.707 --> 00:09:12.337\nBut salary list, it's not very normal for\n\n166\n00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:16.440\npeople to share that kind of\ninformation within an organization.\n\n167\n00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.472\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n168\n00:09:19.472 --> 00:09:24.609\nmaybe I don't want random employees having\naccess to different types of salary lists.\n\n169\n00:09:24.609 --> 00:09:29.839\nSo for example, let's just click\non one of these resources here.\n\n170\n00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.700\nAll right, and I'll zoom back out\na little bit, look at this [LAUGH].\n\n171\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] $1 million. I know that's\namazing. &gt;&gt; Ronnie makes $1 million, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.515\nSo on my file server,\nI'm able to see this,\n\n173\n00:09:44.515 --> 00:09:46.515\nthere's some actual information in here.\n\n174\n00:09:46.515 --> 00:09:50.075\nIf I look at the properties here\nI can see who has access to that.\n\n175\n00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:51.745\n&gt;&gt; I really hope when I get a paycheck,\n\n176\n00:09:51.745 --> 00:09:53.686\nit actually is written exactly\nlike that in capital letters.\n\n177\n00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:55.157\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In all caps, too, right?\n\n178\n00:09:55.157 --> 00:09:57.620\nI had to do it that way, I'm like, yeah.\n\n179\n00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.130\nOkay, so who has access here?\n\n180\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.330\nWell the system, we've got Mary Poppins\nbecause she is actually our\n\n181\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.486\nHR coordinator, so yeah she should have.\n\n182\n00:10:05.486 --> 00:10:07.104\n&gt;&gt; Mary Poppins [LAUGH].\n\n183\n00:10:07.104 --> 00:10:10.570\n&gt;&gt; And then of course administrators for\nour domain in case there's problems with\n\n184\n00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.420\nthis file and\nthey need to assist Miss Mary in any way.\n\n185\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.390\nAll right, so that's what we\nhave here in that HR folder.\n\n186\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:24.740\nNow you could see that Cherokee didn't\nhave any kind of special permissions or\n\n187\n00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.990\nrights to that particular file for\nthat salary list there.\n\n188\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.220\nSo let's go ahead and hop on over\nto our client side system here.\n\n189\n00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:38.350\nI've got a Windows 8 machine and\nI've logged in as CBoose, so myself here.\n\n190\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:43.160\nAnd if I tried to Run and connect back\nto that domain controller, plabdc01,\n\n191\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.795\nyou can see that here,\nlet's just go ahead and hit OK.\n\n192\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.540\nNow I haven't done anything special aside\nfrom setting those normal permissions at\n\n193\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.280\nthis point in time, so what happens if I\ntry to access that human resource folder?\n\n194\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.630\nWell, I can see that there are my\nfiles in here that we just looked at,\n\n195\n00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.180\nthat we talked about,\nI can see that resume folder.\n\n196\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.960\nBut maybe I'm being a little nosey and\n\n197\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.070\nI want to see what does\nRonnie's resume look like?\n\n198\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.410\nAnd I go to click on that, what happens?\n\n199\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.430\nWell, at least the HR, the IT department,\n\n200\n00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.497\nhas locked that down so\nCherokee can't be too nosey.\n\n201\n00:11:19.497 --> 00:11:23.350\nBut Cherokee now knows that there\nis a folder that exists and.\n\n202\n00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.860\nSo let's just make it where\nshe doesn't even see that.\n\n203\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.220\nAnd here I am talking about myself\nin third person, sort of strange.\n\n204\n00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.439\nBut anyways, let's go ahead and\nclose out of here and go back to,\n\n205\n00:11:34.439 --> 00:11:36.990\nwe'll close out File Explorer.\n\n206\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.910\nLet's go back to our server and\nenable access based enumeration.\n\n207\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.480\nPretty simple to do so,\n\n208\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.730\nI'm just here on where those\nparticular documents are residing.\n\n209\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:54.110\nSo let's click File and Storage Services\nright here and select Shares.\n\n210\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.540\nFrom here I can see the shares\nthat I have already setup and\n\n211\n00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.430\nhere is that HR share that we\nwere looking at right here.\n\n212\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.158\nNow, if I right click and\nselect Properties,\n\n213\n00:12:07.158 --> 00:12:12.660\nProperties, I have a couple\nsettings going on here.\n\n214\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.290\nNow, on this particular machine,\n\n215\n00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:21.030\nI've installed a file server\nresource manager, FSRM.\n\n216\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.750\nSo that's why I have an additional\nproperty here for management properties.\n\n217\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.610\nSo if you hadn't installed that, you would\njust see these top three settings here for\n\n218\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.100\nthis particular share.\n\n219\n00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.380\nSo we really want to be\nchecking out the settings.\n\n220\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.400\nIf you were questioning how\nthose permissions were set,\n\n221\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.110\nyou might also want to\ncheck those out too.\n\n222\n00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.380\nWe already looked at the permissions for\nthe different components here, so\n\n223\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.280\nI'm not gonna worry with that.\n\n224\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.600\nBut if you were just coming\ninto an environment,\n\n225\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.740\nthen obviously ABE is defined by\nhow those permissions are set.\n\n226\n00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.480\nSo we'll just go to settings, and\nso currently it is not enabled and\n\n227\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.090\nyou can see that right\nhere by this check box.\n\n228\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:04.290\nIf it was, if you had created\nit in one of those methods\n\n229\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.270\nlike just the regular file explorer share\nthen it would be enabled by default.\n\n230\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.700\nBut we wanna go ahead and\nset this manually and there is\n\n231\n00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.680\nan Apply button somewhere down here,\nlet me see if I can just get to that.\n\n232\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.620\nIf not, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nhit Enter, but\n\n233\n00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.253\nthere's an Apply button in\nthe bottom right hand corner.\n\n234\n00:13:23.253 --> 00:13:26.857\nAnd I can go back here and select,\nProperties just to check on that and\n\n235\n00:13:26.857 --> 00:13:30.399\nverify that it did save that setting\nthere by hitting the Enter, and\n\n236\n00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:32.300\nyou can see that it did.\n\n237\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.080\nSo, let's just close out of here.\n\n238\n00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.140\nNow, if I go back to my client in machine\n\n239\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.260\nI should see the effects\nright here on this system.\n\n240\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.920\nSo let's try to connect as Cherokee Boose.\n\n241\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.310\nWe'll go ahead and hit Run and\nconnect back to that.\n\n242\n00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.790\nNow, you don't have to hit Run every time,\nlike if I had set up a mapped drive or\n\n243\n00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.570\nsomething, that's normally what\nwe would do if that user was\n\n244\n00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.360\naccessing this location frequently.\n\n245\n00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.394\nBut here in HR, all right,\n\n246\n00:14:02.394 --> 00:14:06.220\nI don't see the particular folder.\n\n247\n00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.010\nNumber one the resumes and\nthat salary list so\n\n248\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.630\nI can't become curious and\ntry to access that information.\n\n249\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:18.070\nHowever, like I said,\nall the employees should have access to\n\n250\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.150\na list of, maybe their health providers.\n\n251\n00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.865\nAnd here, let's see, all my doctors that\nI could go ahead and see in this area.\n\n252\n00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:29.635\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Number two's not\ngonna help you too much.\n\n253\n00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I hope number 3 either!\n\n254\n00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:38.740\nBut yeah, I could even click on my PTO\nform to schedule my cool vacation.\n\n255\n00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.635\n&gt;&gt; Nope, you don't get one.\n\n256\n00:14:39.635 --> 00:14:42.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I don't get a vacation.\n\n257\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.670\nNonetheless, you can see how that works,\nit's super easy to set up.\n\n258\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.740\nLike I said, the most difficult thing\nwould be your permissions and just making\n\n259\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:54.970\nsure that those are all set accordingly,\nso that's access based enumeration.\n\n260\n00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.140\nAnother thing we need to talk about\nhere is going to be something\n\n261\n00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.280\ncalled NTFS quotas.\n\n262\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.810\nSo as the name implies, this is a feature\nthat I can use with an NTFS file system,\n\n263\n00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.170\nso once my drive has been\nconfigured with NTFS.\n\n264\n00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.420\nNow, the same concept applies here,\n\n265\n00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.740\nwhenever I'm sharing out any kind\nof shared storage I really need to\n\n266\n00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.770\nbe cognizant of the amount of\nstorage that is being utilized and\n\n267\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:26.440\npotentially the amount of storage that can\nbe utilized maybe, on a per user basis.\n\n268\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.410\nSo, because IT is responsible for that\nmanagement and I can't just go out and\n\n269\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.760\nbuy random discs or anything like that,\nif I don't have the budget for\n\n270\n00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.270\nthat, I just kinda have to\nkeep an eye on things here.\n\n271\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:43.660\nSo by setting NTFS quotas I\ncan restrict potentially,\n\n272\n00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.430\nthere are couple different ways we\ncan set that up and I'll show you.\n\n273\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.480\nBut I can have a good understanding of\nhow much storage is being utilized and\n\n274\n00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.060\neven on a per user basis.\n\n275\n00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.245\nSo this is another cool feature that we\nhave when we're talking about our file and\n\n276\n00:15:58.245 --> 00:15:59.243\nshare access.\n\n277\n00:15:59.243 --> 00:16:04.136\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, so let's talk\nabout a real scenario in which this might\n\n278\n00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:07.665\nbe appropriate in terms of\nchoosing this technology.\n\n279\n00:16:07.665 --> 00:16:10.504\nSo one of the things that you do run\nacross every once in a while, and\n\n280\n00:16:10.504 --> 00:16:13.610\nI know this is hard to believe\nif you're in a work environment.\n\n281\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.160\nThat somebody would actually take\ntheir entire music collection and\n\n282\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.710\nchoose to store it on a centralized share,\nof some sort.\n\n283\n00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.960\nSo it is very possible that somebody\neats up more than their fair share of\n\n284\n00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.090\nstorage space.\n\n285\n00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.178\nYeah, you could have like, Ronnie over\nhere, monopolizing our central share with\n\n286\n00:16:33.178 --> 00:16:34.832\nhis cat videos, or something\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n287\n00:16:34.832 --> 00:16:35.947\n&gt;&gt; Like random and crazy like.\n\n288\n00:16:35.947 --> 00:16:38.185\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like that.\n\n289\n00:16:38.185 --> 00:16:39.202\n&gt;&gt; The cat videos would be it.\n\n290\n00:16:39.202 --> 00:16:39.715\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n291\n00:16:39.715 --> 00:16:40.440\n&gt;&gt; So we just wanna prevent\n\n292\n00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.400\nthat from happening.\n\n293\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.075\nSo this technology has been around, NTFS\nquotas has been around for a long time,\n\n294\n00:16:46.075 --> 00:16:47.126\nsince 2003.\n\n295\n00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:50.820\nThere are couple of different ways that\nI'll show you how you can set it up.\n\n296\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.720\nThe first way is pretty rudimentary.\n\n297\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.720\nIt's on a per volume basis, and\nthat way has been around since 2000.\n\n298\n00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.160\nNow, with the advent of utilizing FSRM,\n\n299\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.250\nthat came with 2008 and\nthose subsequent operating systems,\n\n300\n00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.370\nwe can have a more granular approach,\nand we'll take a look at that as well.\n\n301\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.812\nSo, first of all, let me switch over to,\n\n302\n00:17:13.812 --> 00:17:19.130\nI've got a bit couple different server\nSPN up here, and let's go to PL ABDM 01.\n\n303\n00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.980\nI think I have a volume that is\nconfigured here for some storage.\n\n304\n00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.690\nYeah, so here we have some volume E,\nand maybe volume E is what I want my\n\n305\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.550\nend users to be connecting to and\naccessing for storage.\n\n306\n00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.410\nSo the easiest way to go ahead and\nset this up, like I said,\n\n307\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.025\non a per volume basis,\nwould just be to go ahead and\n\n308\n00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:43.510\nright-click that volume,\nand select Properties.\n\n309\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.100\nNow, let me move this over and\nzoom in so we know exactly what\n\n310\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.490\ntab we would need to click\non in order to set quotas.\n\n311\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.790\nAnd I know it seems a little bit obvious,\nbut\n\n312\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.480\nthere may be a reason why you\nwanna pay attention to that.\n\n313\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.750\nSo we can go ahead and\nselect our Quota tab, all right.\n\n314\n00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.437\nAnd we got a cute little\ntraffic light graphic here.\n\n315\n00:18:06.437 --> 00:18:09.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just in case you're wondering, but\n\n316\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.810\nI think the reason they have that here\nis because it's almost like you can have\n\n317\n00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.290\na warning,\nlike slow down your storage usage here,\n\n318\n00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:23.490\nbecause we have the ability to set\nsomething called soft or hard quotas.\n\n319\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:28.550\nSo a hard quota is going\nto be preventing that user\n\n320\n00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.276\nfrom adding any additional component, or\n\n321\n00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:36.640\nany kind of binary,\ninto that disk space that we've set.\n\n322\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.390\nSo if they're going over their quota\nlimit, then they're just not able to.\n\n323\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:45.275\nThat can be problematic because,\nwhat if that user\n\n324\n00:18:45.275 --> 00:18:49.770\nis legitimately trying to store\ninformation, and it's not just cat videos?\n\n325\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then, in that sense,\n\n326\n00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:54.425\nyou're preventing, potentially,\nthat user from performing their job.\n\n327\n00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:57.477\nAnd that's not something\nthat we want to have happen.\n\n328\n00:18:57.477 --> 00:19:02.327\nSo, you can set a soft quota,\nwhich will just give them a warning.\n\n329\n00:19:02.327 --> 00:19:07.717\nOr with this basic methodology, this\nfirst method that I'm showing you here,\n\n330\n00:19:07.717 --> 00:19:13.100\nit doesn't really give them\na warning with the newer,\n\n331\n00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.120\nwhen we look at FRSM, then we can\nset it to auto generate emails.\n\n332\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.650\nOtherwise here we would have\nto set up some kind of trigger\n\n333\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.320\nwith our event log to go ahead, and we\nhave to create a script to do that for us.\n\n334\n00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.310\nSo the newer method is a little more\nautomated and easier for us to use, but\n\n335\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.390\njust know we have two different\nways of setting this up here.\n\n336\n00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:36.220\nThe first thing that we have to look at\nis going to be, well, let's go ahead and\n\n337\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.800\nenable it.\n\n338\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.490\nNow, the first time that you set this\nto enable it, you can set limits,\n\n339\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.500\nor you can opt not to set limits and\nthen go back and set them later.\n\n340\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.040\nBecause what happens\nthe first time you run this,\n\n341\n00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.790\nis it's gonna basically be analyzing\nyour volume, and checking,\n\n342\n00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.190\nand see what is actually happening,\nwho has access.\n\n343\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.860\nAnd it goes on a per owner basis.\n\n344\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.296\nSo whoever the owner of that file is,\n\n345\n00:20:03.296 --> 00:20:08.040\nis who is going to be taking\nthe responsibility for that storage.\n\n346\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.160\nHowever, it doesn't act\nretrospectively here, so\n\n347\n00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.370\nthat's also something\nthat we'd wanna consider.\n\n348\n00:20:14.765 --> 00:20:19.950\nIf I utilize this checkbox right here,\ndeny disk space to users\n\n349\n00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:25.630\nexceeding that quota limit, this is going\nto be that hard quota that we spoke about.\n\n350\n00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.415\nSo we're not gonna be able to add\nanything to that particular volume.\n\n351\n00:20:29.415 --> 00:20:35.530\nAll right, so I have, now this is,\nI can enable it, like I said, without\n\n352\n00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.960\nactually enforcing that quota initially,\nand then go back, and configure it.\n\n353\n00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.578\nHowever, let's go ahead and\nthink about this.\n\n354\n00:20:43.578 --> 00:20:48.410\nI can limit disk space to,\n\n355\n00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:52.620\nhere I have 1 kilobyte,\nbut it's going to be\n\n356\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:58.380\nevenly distributed per user when\nI set it up in this method,\n\n357\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:04.530\nunless I set any kind of exceptions\nhere with my quota entries.\n\n358\n00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.113\nAnd we'll take a look at that, but I don't\nwanna glance over my warning level here.\n\n359\n00:21:08.113 --> 00:21:10.631\nSo my warning level is going to be\n\n360\n00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:14.750\ngenerating that warning in\nour event viewer for us.\n\n361\n00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.080\nSo if we were actively monitoring that,\n\n362\n00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.170\nthen we would have a good understanding of\nthe storage within our environment there.\n\n363\n00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.840\nAll right, so\nyou can set the quota logging options for\n\n364\n00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.415\nthis volume to log the event when a user\nexceeds their quota limit, and or\n\n365\n00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:33.874\nlog the event when a user\nexceeds their warning level.\n\n366\n00:21:33.874 --> 00:21:37.539\nNow, if I have someone like\nthe CEO come to me and say,\n\n367\n00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:43.640\nthese restrictions that you've imposed are\nridiculous, and I need x amount of data.\n\n368\n00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.260\nWell, it's the CEO, so\nyou might wanna listen to them.\n\n369\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.450\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at how we would.\n\n370\n00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.240\nWhere did my computer go?\n\n371\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:54.855\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; Try to scroll down.\n\n372\n00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:56.320\n&gt;&gt; Let me just get that\nback down on the screen.\n\n373\n00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.240\nI know, it just bounced on me real quick.\n\n374\n00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.260\nAll right, so here is where we\ncan set those individual quotas.\n\n375\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.235\nSo from this quota down box,\nI would just select new quota entry.\n\n376\n00:22:06.235 --> 00:22:10.080\nAnd so,\nmaybe I wanna set a quota on Cherokee,\n\n377\n00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.800\nsince I'm already logged in\non that client, to CBoose.\n\n378\n00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.630\nAll right, I'll just do our\ncheck names here to make sure\n\n379\n00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.170\nthat everything comes in properly,\nand we'll select OK.\n\n380\n00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:26.450\nNow, let's go ahead and limit myself here,\nand we'll just keep it at that default.\n\n381\n00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.610\nI think I have a couple files we can try\nto pull on over to our E drive here.\n\n382\n00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:35.900\nAnd let's go ahead, and\nwe'll just leave that limit there.\n\n383\n00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.440\nIt's fine.\nWe won't worry about generating\n\n384\n00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440\nthose warnings right now.\n\n385\n00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.820\nWe'll just hit OK, and close out of here.\n\n386\n00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, and\nnow that we've got that set,\n\n387\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.330\nany last considerations before we\ngo ahead and apply these settings?\n\n388\n00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ronnie,\n\n389\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:52.380\nthat analysis of the volume will\noccur whenever you do apply this.\n\n390\n00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.270\nSo you might wanna keep that in mind.\n\n391\n00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.370\nAnd let me just show you.\n\n392\n00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.830\nIt should give us a warning here.\n\n393\n00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.720\nThere it is.\nIt says,\n\n394\n00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.600\nyou should enable the quota only if you\nintend to use quotas on a disk volume,\n\n395\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.130\nand then when you enable the quota\nsystem the volume will be rescanned.\n\n396\n00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:10.430\nSo this rescanning may take a while if\nyou have a lot of information stored\n\n397\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.280\non that volume.\n\n398\n00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.210\nSo just kinda keep that in mind.\n\n399\n00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:17.500\nBut aside from that,\nI think we should be good to go here.\n\n400\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.000\nIf we hop on over to our client side\nsystem, which is gonna be our Windows 8.1\n\n401\n00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.550\nmachine down here, let me see,\nwe can just access that.\n\n402\n00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.420\nAnd I just had it up here.\n\n403\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.760\nI just want to show how we got there.\n\n404\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.000\nThis was our plabdemo1 machine.\n\n405\n00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.210\nAnd again, we would map a network drive\nif we were accessing this frequently, but\n\n406\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.190\nlet's go ahead and open that.\n\n407\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.340\nSo currently, I have nothing\nin this particular folder, but\n\n408\n00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:50.920\nif I wanted to add some files, so here I\nhave a five meg and a one kilobyte file.\n\n409\n00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.927\nSince this is my limitation,\nI have to kind\n\n410\n00:23:55.927 --> 00:24:00.665\nof be cognizant of what I'm doing here.\n\n411\n00:24:00.665 --> 00:24:02.034\nAnd I don't even know if I give myself\n\n412\n00:24:02.034 --> 00:24:02.576\npermissions\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n413\n00:24:02.576 --> 00:24:05.649\n&gt;&gt; Here for this particular volume, but\n\n414\n00:24:05.649 --> 00:24:08.920\nWhat would happen here theoretically?\n\n415\n00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.467\nA couple different things.\n\n416\n00:24:09.467 --> 00:24:14.120\nNumber one,\nif I had set this as a hard quota.\n\n417\n00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.290\nIf I had my quota limit there,\nI would be able to add this file but\n\n418\n00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.880\nI wouldn't be able to add this secondary\nfile that would exceed that limit.\n\n419\n00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.030\nThat's why it's important to go ahead and\nset a soft quota\n\n420\n00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:29.060\nbecause that user is still is able to\nput their information into that share.\n\n421\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.600\nBut their\n\n422\n00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.550\nstill going be receiving an alert if we go\nahead and set that up in the backend side.\n\n423\n00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.650\nSo with proactive management,\n\n424\n00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.830\nwe'll still be able to manage\nour storage space adequately.\n\n425\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.840\nAnd from the end user's perspective,\n\n426\n00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:52.190\nit's like they're only seeing that quotum\nlimit as the size of the actual volume.\n\n427\n00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:57.355\nAnd they're not seeing that\nfull ten gigs of that volume E.\n\n428\n00:24:57.355 --> 00:25:00.565\nThere is also another way\nthat we can set this up and\n\n429\n00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:03.720\nthat is going to be if we install FSRM.\n\n430\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.620\nSo I don't think I have that\ninstalled on the server\n\n431\n00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.780\nwe were working on which was PLABDMO1.\n\n432\n00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.575\nIt's really simple to setup,\n\n433\n00:25:11.575 --> 00:25:15.740\nit's just under server manager, just as\nyou would install any other role here.\n\n434\n00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:21.380\nThe actual role process and\nyou guys have seen a walk through this.\n\n435\n00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.812\nSo we'll go ahead and begin this.\n\n436\n00:25:25.812 --> 00:25:32.540\nAlthough let's see,\nmy little Next button is kinda hidden.\n\n437\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.330\nAnd that's what I'm doing here,\n\n438\n00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.840\nI'm clicking through our\nrole based installation.\n\n439\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.550\nI'm installing it on this machine and\nwhenever I look at this,\n\n440\n00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:45.670\nI'm going to be expanding out file and\nstorage services.\n\n441\n00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.430\nAnd then, also expanding out file and\niSCSI services.\n\n442\n00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:55.380\nAnd this is where I will locate my\nfile server resource manager, FSRM.\n\n443\n00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.570\nThese are gonna be the associated\ncomponents to go ahead and\n\n444\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.760\nadd those particular features.\n\n445\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.470\nAnd we'll hit Next.\n\n446\n00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.267\nOops.\n\n447\n00:26:05.267 --> 00:26:09.217\nI wanna make sure that is checked,\nwe'll hit Next and Next.\n\n448\n00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.243\nSorry, my machine's\nbouncing around on me here.\n\n449\n00:26:20.243 --> 00:26:22.959\nLet's hit Next and\n\n450\n00:26:22.959 --> 00:26:27.886\none more page here, and install.\n\n451\n00:26:32.537 --> 00:26:33.931\n&gt;&gt; If not, you may have to tab it through.\n\n452\n00:26:33.931 --> 00:26:34.882\n&gt;&gt; Tab it through.\n\n453\n00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.349\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\nit's starting to get there.\n\n454\n00:26:38.349 --> 00:26:39.620\nAnd then there was one, yeah, two.\n\n455\n00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.790\n&gt;&gt; That's the installation.\n\n456\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.390\nSorry guys, I just had to tab\nthrough because I couldn't\n\n457\n00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.880\nsee my button's kind of hiding on me\nright here in my lab environment.\n\n458\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.430\nYou may experience that too if\nyou're utilizing it this way.\n\n459\n00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:55.150\nThis is gonna take a moment to go ahead\nand install this particular feature.\n\n460\n00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.566\nSo what we'll do is just have\na TV time out real quick so\n\n461\n00:26:57.566 --> 00:26:58.927\nyou don't have to wait on us.\n\n462\n00:26:58.927 --> 00:27:01.440\nBut it's pretty straightforward\nonce we get that installed.\n\n463\n00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.110\nSo now we're gonna go under tools.\n\n464\n00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.710\nAnd so Ronnie, I think I've said\nthis a couple different ways here.\n\n465\n00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.800\nThis acronym always gets me, but\nit's file server resource manager.\n\n466\n00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.290\nOnce we have that installed,\nwe can pull it up.\n\n467\n00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.970\nNow, file server resource manager\n\n468\n00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.060\ndoes a lot more than what we're\njust looking at here in this show.\n\n469\n00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.761\nAs a matter of fact, you'll take a look\nmore in depth in 70-412 a lot of\n\n470\n00:27:25.761 --> 00:27:28.487\nthose components such as classification.\n\n471\n00:27:28.487 --> 00:27:31.640\nThis is where you, one of the ways\nyou can go ahead and set those.\n\n472\n00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.420\nBut for right now I really\njust want to focus on our\n\n473\n00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.660\nQuota Management which is over\nhere on the left panes side.\n\n474\n00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.866\nSo let me zoomed in so you can see that.\n\n475\n00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:44.050\nIf I expand this out I have\na couple of different options so.\n\n476\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.320\nThere are some quoted templates\nthat are preconfigured for me,\n\n477\n00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.385\nor for us here in this setting.\n\n478\n00:27:50.385 --> 00:27:52.540\nLet me zoom back out so we can see that.\n\n479\n00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.860\nSo, I have my limitations,\nI have my quoted type designated,\n\n480\n00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.310\nwhether it's hard or soft right here.\n\n481\n00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:04.280\nNow if I wanted to create my own\nquota limit, I could do that as well,\n\n482\n00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.510\nit's pretty simple from this interface.\n\n483\n00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.510\nA couple different ways I could do that,\nI could just right-click and\n\n484\n00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.480\ncreate quota over here\non the right-hand side,\n\n485\n00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.880\nI could use my action drop-down menu,\nwhatever way you prefer.\n\n486\n00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.741\nAnd this'll launch that\nparticular wizard right there.\n\n487\n00:28:20.741 --> 00:28:25.680\nSo I could go ahead and set my quota\npath depending on the location of that.\n\n488\n00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:33.046\nSo for this PC, we'll just go ahead and\nset it here on our E drive and select OK.\n\n489\n00:28:33.046 --> 00:28:35.475\nAnd I have a couple of\ndifferent options here,\n\n490\n00:28:35.475 --> 00:28:38.353\nhow do you want to configure\nyour quota of properties.\n\n491\n00:28:38.353 --> 00:28:43.940\nAnd you have the size like we saw before,\na couple of different preconfigured sizes.\n\n492\n00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.900\nBut if I wanted to be a little more\nspecific, I do have the option with this\n\n493\n00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.140\nbutton right here to go ahead and\ndefine custom quota properties.\n\n494\n00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.545\nAnd we can go ahead and\nselect that, and zoom back out.\n\n495\n00:28:56.545 --> 00:29:01.392\nAnd then also I have the ability to\nset specific notification components\n\n496\n00:29:01.392 --> 00:29:05.120\nright here down at\nthe bottom by selecting ad.\n\n497\n00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.150\nAnd this is what I was talking about,\n\n498\n00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:14.140\nthis will help automate that notification\nprocess if you choose to use this option.\n\n499\n00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.369\nSo let's take a look at that and\nmove it over so\n\n500\n00:29:16.369 --> 00:29:18.314\nwe can see this fine print up at the top.\n\n501\n00:29:18.314 --> 00:29:21.779\nIt says generate notification\nwhen usage reaches and\n\n502\n00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:25.160\nthen you can specify\nthe percentage amount.\n\n503\n00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.574\nBy default, it's set at 85%.\n\n504\n00:29:27.574 --> 00:29:29.900\nYou can change that if\nyou choose to do so.\n\n505\n00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.680\nAnd you can also specify an email\naddress for the admin, which is nice.\n\n506\n00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.569\nSo instead of sifting through those logs,\n\n507\n00:29:36.569 --> 00:29:41.802\nthey're getting a direct email saying,\nhey, whatever this percentages.\n\n508\n00:29:41.802 --> 00:29:45.346\nAnd you can set that to receive\nthe notification just to help the admins\n\n509\n00:29:45.346 --> 00:29:47.600\nmonitoring this a little bit better.\n\n510\n00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.500\nBut what about the end user, the clients,\n\n511\n00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.840\nhow would they know that they starting\nto exceed their storage base?\n\n512\n00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.410\nWell, I also have the option\nright here to select\n\n513\n00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.700\nto send an email to the user who\nexceeded that threshold as well.\n\n514\n00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.167\nSo this is kind of\na better way of doing it,\n\n515\n00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:05.984\nif you want to let people know about it,\nwhich hopefully you do.\n\n516\n00:30:05.984 --> 00:30:10.360\nAnd then this is just the template for\nthat email as well.\n\n517\n00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.490\nI'm just gonna close out of here.\n\n518\n00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.250\nAnd again,\nthere's a lot that you can do with quotas,\n\n519\n00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.820\nespecially when you're talking\nabout some of those more advanced\n\n520\n00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:23.310\nfeatures that you will look at\na little bit later on down the road.\n\n521\n00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:25.920\nBut for now, I think that's about it for\nQuota Management.\n\n522\n00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.908\nAnd then we also talked about\naccess based enumeration.\n\n523\n00:30:28.908 --> 00:30:34.510\nAnd we've reached the end of our file and\nshare access journey here.\n\n524\n00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:38.040\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, thank you again for\nhelping us understand a little bit more\n\n525\n00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.630\nabout access based enumeration and\nNTFS quotas.\n\n526\n00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.400\nRemember that both of these\ntechnologies in the configuration\n\n527\n00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.190\nis not super difficult to configure.\n\n528\n00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.000\nBut that means for\nyou as you prepare for the exam\n\n529\n00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.860\nyou need to study some those individual\ncomponents such Cherokee pointed out.\n\n530\n00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.670\nAnd understand which ones you're going\nto use and how to get them set up.\n\n531\n00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.256\nIt is very important that\nyou actually get that ready.\n\n532\n00:31:00.256 --> 00:31:01.710\nEspecially as you go on to the exam.\n\n533\n00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.810\nBecause you're more than likely\nto face scenario based questions\n\n534\n00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.170\nas well as some configuration\nquestions about where and\n\n535\n00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.290\nwhat needs to be actually\nconfigured as you move forward.\n\n536\n00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:15.640\nBut there's more to come in 70-410,\nbut that is for another episode.\n\n537\n00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.860\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n538\n00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n539\n00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.722\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n540\n00:31:24.722 --> 00:31:32.194\n[MUSIC]\n\n541\n00:31:32.194 --> 00:31:35.476\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.311\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:12.540\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.170\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.775\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:24.290\nWe're specifically diving into,\nof course, 70-410 on the exam side.\n\n8\n00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.380\nAnd today we're looking\nat configuring printers.\n\n9\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.570\nAnd here to help us out, of course,\nis gonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.260\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.236\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Ronnie,\nyeah, we're here with our favorite,\n\n12\n00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:37.410\neverybody's favorite topic and\nthat's gonna be printers.\n\n13\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.750\nI joke but all kidding aside,\n\n14\n00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.400\nthey are such an integral part of\nour business environments today.\n\n15\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.060\nThat's why we hear a lot about it\nwhenever they're not working correctly.\n\n16\n00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.278\nSo, a lot of you probably\n\n17\n00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:53.820\nare already familiar with just\nthe basic configuration of printers.\n\n18\n00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.130\nSo here we're just gonna be taking\nit a little bit further and\n\n19\n00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.700\nlook at it from\nan enterprise side of thing.\n\n20\n00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.870\nWhen we're talking about\nconfiguring our printers.\n\n21\n00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.377\nNow let's take a look at my screen real\nquick and talk about some of those terms.\n\n22\n00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:12.343\nMicrosoft is a little picky, I guess picky\nI don't know if that's the right word, but\n\n23\n00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:16.645\nthey just wanna make sure that you\nunderstand where they're coming from.\n\n24\n00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:21.505\nBecause predominantly Microsoft has\nbeen a software manufacturer for\n\n25\n00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:23.692\nthe majority of its life there.\n\n26\n00:01:23.692 --> 00:01:29.150\nSo if we look at my screen here I\nwant to explain some of these terms.\n\n27\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.810\nSo if we think about printers, and\nthe way that we use it in conversation for\n\n28\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.250\nthe most part, when we say printers,\nRonnie, I don't know how you think of it.\n\n29\n00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.510\nBut a lot of people think of a printer as\nbeing the hardware device, something that\n\n30\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.910\nyou can touch and put the paper in, and\nthat's where you get your print out from.\n\n31\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.380\nBut in Microsoft terminology\n\n32\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.940\nthe printer is actually the software\nthat resides on the system.\n\n33\n00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.010\nSo that's why I have some printer\nsitting here inside of my print server.\n\n34\n00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.295\nSo a print server is simply\ngoing to be a machine,\n\n35\n00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:09.025\nhere I have 2012 R2 running our Print and\nDocuments Services.\n\n36\n00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:13.375\nThere are a couple of different\nways that I can share\n\n37\n00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:14.772\nprinters out on my network, right.\n\n38\n00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:24.265\nSo if I have like a client with a print\ndevice, the physical print device,\n\n39\n00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:28.495\nattached to that computer\nthat's called direct printing.\n\n40\n00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:33.950\nOkay, and so this end user can print\ndirectly to that print device.\n\n41\n00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.938\nThis may be helpful in situations like\nin the human resource department where\n\n42\n00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:43.935\nyou don't want sensitive documents\nresting on a centrally shared printer.\n\n43\n00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:47.239\nOf course there are other ways you\ncan configure and set that up, so\n\n44\n00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.537\nusers have to input a pin or\n\n45\n00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:52.439\nsomething like that to print when they're\nstanding in line for that printer.\n\n46\n00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.950\nBut security is something that should\nalways be in the back of our minds.\n\n47\n00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.990\nBut what if I wanted\nto share this printer,\n\n48\n00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.470\nprint device excuse me, and\nI probably am gonna mess up throughout\n\n49\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.810\nthis series when we're talking about\nprinters and print devices here.\n\n50\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.330\nSimply just from habit but\n\n51\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.130\nI do wanna let you know the difference\nbetween those terms there.\n\n52\n00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.640\nSo what if I want to share this\n\n53\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.550\ndirectly attached print device\nto others within my network?\n\n54\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.680\nWell I have the ability to do so.\n\n55\n00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.010\nSo that would be a shared printer or\nshared print device, right.\n\n56\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.690\nNow you also see this term, a Network\nPrint Device or a network printer,\n\n57\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.040\nwhat if that particular print device\nwas not directly attached to any PC and\n\n58\n00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.000\nit was utilizing wireless technology?\n\n59\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.100\nWireless is so common nowadays,\nmaybe I have users connecting,\n\n60\n00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.470\nmultiple users connecting to a wireless\nprinter, a network based printer.\n\n61\n00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.180\nYou can also have Network Print Devices\nthat have network interface\n\n62\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.700\ncards that plug directly in via Ethernet\nand other types of connections as well.\n\n63\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.480\nBut what are some other\nthings that we can do here?\n\n64\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.690\nIf I look over at my print server,\nI see more than one machine set up.\n\n65\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.500\nWell, if I'm talking about scalability and\nI'm scaling up.\n\n66\n00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.180\nAnd I want to have more than just one\nprinter available for my end users.\n\n67\n00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.430\nMaybe I have high volume printing,\nI can create a printer pool.\n\n68\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.215\nAnd over here on the left hand side,\nI just kind of made this\n\n69\n00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:26.475\nlittle drawing here because you want\nto have some logic involved whenever\n\n70\n00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:30.085\nyour designing in the placement of\nactually setting up a printer pool.\n\n71\n00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:31.355\nSo what is a printer pool?\n\n72\n00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:37.815\nA printer pool is the ability to take\nprinters, that utilize the same drivers,\n\n73\n00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:42.030\nand then set them up in\nalternating fashion.\n\n74\n00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.488\nSo you'll have,\nlet me think about the terminology here,\n\n75\n00:04:45.488 --> 00:04:47.157\nI wanna make sure I clarify.\n\n76\n00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:52.661\nSo from the end user side, they'll see\none printer, the software printer.\n\n77\n00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:59.500\nBut you'll have two or more of those print\ndevices, so that it can round robin and\n\n78\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.850\ncirculate through whichever\nprint device is available.\n\n79\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.180\nSo you don't wanna place\nthose print devices\n\n80\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.440\nin really just separate areas of your\nbuilding, especially on multiple floors.\n\n81\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.063\nBecause that end users not able to,\n\n82\n00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:21.444\nspecify which print device\nthey're sending their job to.\n\n83\n00:05:21.444 --> 00:05:26.073\nAnd we don't want our end users running\naround the buildings, looking for\n\n84\n00:05:26.073 --> 00:05:27.919\ntheir printer output there.\n\n85\n00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.969\nSo just something to think about.\n\n86\n00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.791\nWe have this concept called a print\nspooler, and print spooler is\n\n87\n00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:40.715\ngoing to be the idea of, okay,\nwhere are we caching this print job?\n\n88\n00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.898\nSo if I go to send\nsomething to the spooler,\n\n89\n00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:45.642\nI'm not gonna be caching it\nhere on my local machine.\n\n90\n00:05:45.642 --> 00:05:51.701\nAnd then once it's completely ready\nto go send it on to that printer,\n\n91\n00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:55.774\nor am I gonna send the information,\nthe data,\n\n92\n00:05:55.774 --> 00:05:59.650\nto that printer and\nhave it print directly.\n\n93\n00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.760\nIf I am going to be sending my\ninformation to a printer and\n\n94\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.430\nhave it completely render and\nbefore I initiate that print job,\n\n95\n00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.680\nI have to think about how\nmuch RAM that printer has.\n\n96\n00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.380\nSo you don't wanna overwhelm\nthat particular print device.\n\n97\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.585\nSo those are just a couple\nsettings that we'll look at here.\n\n98\n00:06:21.585 --> 00:06:26.100\nThis term print queue,\nprint queue is going to be,\n\n99\n00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.043\nI guess it's almost like a line.\n\n100\n00:06:29.043 --> 00:06:34.050\nLike if you're standing in a line, waiting\nfor food or something at a cafeteria.\n\n101\n00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.750\nYour print queue can determine and it\nhouses those jobs that are queued up and\n\n102\n00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.846\nready to go, right, and\nwe'll see that as well.\n\n103\n00:06:41.846 --> 00:06:44.411\n&gt;&gt; Now just as you pointed\nthat out I hate to say it,\n\n104\n00:06:44.411 --> 00:06:46.517\nI think you misspelled queue there.\n\n105\n00:06:46.517 --> 00:06:49.192\n&gt;&gt; Lovely.\n&gt;&gt; And it happens, but just that's what\n\n106\n00:06:49.192 --> 00:06:54.270\nshe was referring to I wasn't exactly\nsure and I just kinda focused in on that.\n\n107\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.516\nSo just to be aware.\n\n108\n00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:59.121\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there's probably more, guys,\n\n109\n00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:00.347\nI'll tell you that.\n\n110\n00:07:00.347 --> 00:07:04.316\nThat's what happens sometimes when\nyou do this late at night, too.\n\n111\n00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:08.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Also, virtual printers, virtual\n\n112\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.887\nprinters, Internet printing, we'll see\nsome of these terms are actually newer.\n\n113\n00:07:12.887 --> 00:07:15.588\nAnd we hadn't always\nseen them in the past,\n\n114\n00:07:15.588 --> 00:07:20.333\nvirtual printers are gonna be like if\nyou're printing to file or you have your\n\n115\n00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:25.097\ndifferent types of Microsoft XPS\nprinters and different virtual printers.\n\n116\n00:07:25.097 --> 00:07:28.732\nSo just be aware of the terminology\nbefore you enter this realm.\n\n117\n00:07:28.732 --> 00:07:31.107\nIt'll just help you understand,\nwhen you're studying for\n\n118\n00:07:31.107 --> 00:07:33.903\nthe exam, and\njust make things a little easier for you.\n\n119\n00:07:33.903 --> 00:07:37.353\nIt's not difficult when we're\ndealing with printers here.\n\n120\n00:07:37.353 --> 00:07:40.323\nAnd a lot of the interfaces you\nshould already be acclimated to,\n\n121\n00:07:40.323 --> 00:07:43.193\nbecause they're very similar\nfrom the client side.\n\n122\n00:07:43.193 --> 00:07:47.393\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat that looks like.\n\n123\n00:07:47.393 --> 00:07:49.804\nIf I pull up,\nI think I've got a server sitting here.\n\n124\n00:07:49.804 --> 00:07:55.525\nAnd let me just see here,\nmy resolution I've been playing\n\n125\n00:07:55.525 --> 00:08:00.560\nwith it a little bit guys,\nbear with me, alright.\n\n126\n00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.459\nNow, I can't access, by instinct, I want\nto pull up Server Manager first here,\n\n127\n00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:11.163\nbecause that's probably where you\nwould want to be managing your\n\n128\n00:08:11.163 --> 00:08:15.370\nprinter's native leader in\nan enterprise environment.\n\n129\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.060\nBut let's just also take a look\nbefore we get there at Control Panel.\n\n130\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.710\nI still have the ability\nto actually manage my\n\n131\n00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.800\nprinters right here within\nControl Panel as well.\n\n132\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.380\nAnd that's still gonna be similarly\nto what we see on the client side\n\n133\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.380\nhere under Hardware.\n\n134\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.840\nSo let's just go ahead and click on that.\n\n135\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.140\nAnd if I wanted to go ahead and\nadd a printer to this PC here,\n\n136\n00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.680\nI could go ahead and\nselect my Advanced Printer Setup.\n\n137\n00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.730\nAnd what it's doing right now just like\nyou would see on your client's side,\n\n138\n00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.080\nwe're looking for\nmaybe if I had a locally attached printer.\n\n139\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.243\nIt's not going to find anything here,\nI don't have anything attached.\n\n140\n00:08:55.243 --> 00:09:01.195\nSo I can either wait for it to run, or\nme being the impatient person that I am,\n\n141\n00:09:01.195 --> 00:09:04.295\nI can stop it or just let it finish here.\n\n142\n00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:07.812\nAnd then manually configure\nit how I want it to look.\n\n143\n00:09:07.812 --> 00:09:14.124\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and select Next\nand looking at these options that I have.\n\n144\n00:09:14.124 --> 00:09:18.124\nI have the ability to find a printer\nin the directory based on location or\n\n145\n00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:18.733\nfeature.\n\n146\n00:09:18.733 --> 00:09:23.636\nSo we'll also look at how we can add\nprinters to our active directory.\n\n147\n00:09:23.636 --> 00:09:30.350\n[LAUGH] l can select a shared\nprinter by the name.\n\n148\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.841\nSo if I had a directly attached\nprinter and I had shared it out or\n\n149\n00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:41.597\nsomething like that I could just\nnavigate to that network location.\n\n150\n00:09:41.597 --> 00:09:46.220\nI really like this option and\na business environment here as well.\n\n151\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.030\nIf you have TCPIP address or\n\n152\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:54.650\nhost name, this is vendor independent so\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n153\n00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.830\nAnd remember our printers are going\nto be our printed devices are going\n\n154\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.850\nto be devices that we want to set with\nstatic IP addresses in our environment.\n\n155\n00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.690\nOtherwise, that's just gonna be fun for\nyou.\n\n156\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:12.620\nWe also have the ability to utilize other\ntypes of wireless connections here.\n\n157\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.207\nWe have Bluetooth wireless,\nour network discoverable printer.\n\n158\n00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:20.330\nAnd then we can also add a local printer\nor a network printer with manual settings.\n\n159\n00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.380\nCouple different options we have here.\n\n160\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.004\nI'm gonna select this local printer\nbecause I really don't have one on my\n\n161\n00:10:26.004 --> 00:10:26.830\ncomputer here.\n\n162\n00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:32.200\nWe'll just kind of trick it by selecting\na different type of port here.\n\n163\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.710\nSo I don't have an LPT\nport directly attached.\n\n164\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.560\nI will say that I'm just gonna\nbe printing to file here,\n\n165\n00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.320\nby utilizing one of\nthose virtual printers.\n\n166\n00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.110\nAll right, we'll hit Next.\n\n167\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.920\nAnd because I don't have\na legit printer here,\n\n168\n00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.420\nI'm just going to pick some\ndefault information here.\n\n169\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.648\nI actually like Brother's,\nI think they're pretty good devices.\n\n170\n00:10:56.648 --> 00:11:00.190\nSo, we'll just take that Brother and\nget the Brother driver.\n\n171\n00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:05.359\n[LAUGH] They make printers,\nand they also make sewing\n\n172\n00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:10.298\nmachines, and\nI'm sure they make other things.\n\n173\n00:11:10.298 --> 00:11:13.118\nBut it's a good brand, I actually have a-\n&gt;&gt; It was what you said,\n\n174\n00:11:13.118 --> 00:11:15.174\nwhen you said we were the brothers.\n\n175\n00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:17.113\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay?\n\n176\n00:11:17.113 --> 00:11:20.897\n&gt;&gt; I have a Brother printer at home, and\nI also have a Brother sewing machine.\n\n177\n00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:21.513\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n\n178\n00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:22.697\n&gt;&gt; So, all right,\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n179\n00:11:22.697 --> 00:11:23.231\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n180\n00:11:23.231 --> 00:11:25.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Moving along here.\n\n181\n00:11:25.228 --> 00:11:26.668\nYou know what?\n\n182\n00:11:26.668 --> 00:11:32.670\nActually, I wanted to show you,\nI'll just talk about it.\n\n183\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.920\nYou guys probably saw, just like with\nthe client set up you have the option\n\n184\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.790\nto either utilize Windows updates to\ntry to reach out to grab that driver.\n\n185\n00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.110\nAnd then they still have that button\nthat says, hey, I still have the disk.\n\n186\n00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.180\nNot my favorite option.\n\n187\n00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.410\nIf you want to have that driver stored\nsomewhere else, you can as well,\n\n188\n00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.730\nbut just remember, if you're thinking,\n\n189\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.790\nlike having the disk, a lot of times those\ndisk drivers are out dated anyways, so.\n\n190\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.660\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee, if you just want\nto go back you have the upper.\n\n191\n00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Up on the top.\n\n192\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.016\nThere we go.\nCool, sorry,\n\n193\n00:12:03.016 --> 00:12:05.377\njust didn't see the back right there.\n\n194\n00:12:05.377 --> 00:12:10.541\nAll right, so this is where you can\nspecify the location of that driver or\n\n195\n00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:14.280\nutilize Windows Update to\ncall out to the internet.\n\n196\n00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.260\nDriver signing,\nthat is also something that\n\n197\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.160\ndepending on if your system is set to\nonly utilize signed drivers or not.\n\n198\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.270\nBut we'll just hit Next here.\n\n199\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.230\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, the importance of that\nhave disk at times especially in a real\n\n200\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.400\nproduction environment might be\nsomething you're likely to see\n\n201\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.260\nwhich is you have a printer that has\nbeen around for close to a decade.\n\n202\n00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.510\nAnd now you go to the website,\nand you can't find the driver.\n\n203\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.390\nIt seems funny enough, and\nhopefully that will never happen to you.\n\n204\n00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.910\nBut you may actually find out\nwhere you have to kind of\n\n205\n00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.520\nbe able to run that driver.\n\n206\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.270\nAnd it may not run correctly,\nespecially in today's modern\n\n207\n00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.690\noperating systems that they require signed\ndrivers and all of that different stuff.\n\n208\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.200\nBut that actually gives\nyou a good impetus to say,\n\n209\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.710\nlook, we're not able to actually run this\non our newer computer system anymore.\n\n210\n00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.970\nWe may need to update that printer but\n\n211\n00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.960\ndon't put it past a company that you\nget hired into that you may end up\n\n212\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.510\nhaving to be able to make that\nprinter at least try and run and work.\n\n213\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.500\nAnd the only way for you do that of\ncourse is to establish or to install\n\n214\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.320\nthat particular print driver that\nyou're only gonna find on that disk or\n\n215\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.540\nyou have stored in\nthe centralized location.\n\n216\n00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.460\nAnd then you can go and\nsearch for it there.\n\n217\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.896\nSo as easy as it is for\nus to dismiss it today.\n\n218\n00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:33.734\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and joke about it.\n\n219\n00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:35.465\n&gt;&gt; Maybe something we can't really, yeah.\n\n220\n00:13:35.465 --> 00:13:36.195\n&gt;&gt; Good point Ronnie.\n\n221\n00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:37.090\n&gt;&gt; You may not be able to do that.\n\n222\n00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, we don't want\nanyone to struggle with that.\n\n223\n00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:40.724\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n224\n00:13:40.724 --> 00:13:44.524\n&gt;&gt; Now, the printer name, so you have\nthe ability to put that default name of\n\n225\n00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:48.542\nthe printer that I selected for that\nparticular manufacture and model here.\n\n226\n00:13:48.542 --> 00:13:53.613\nBut, I think it would be better just to go\nahead and let's say if you have a printer\n\n227\n00:13:53.613 --> 00:13:58.324\nset up maybe for the sales department,\nand you could change that to sales.\n\n228\n00:13:58.324 --> 00:14:03.279\nBecause on the back end of things, if I\nwanted to change this print device out,\n\n229\n00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:07.335\nthe physical prints device itself or\nsomething to that nature,\n\n230\n00:14:07.335 --> 00:14:11.539\nif I made some kind of network\ninterface car change to that device or\n\n231\n00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:14.465\nhad some kind of configuration change.\n\n232\n00:14:14.465 --> 00:14:17.065\nI wouldn't have to worry\nabout that name too much,\n\n233\n00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.685\nif it is something generic like Sales.\n\n234\n00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:26.364\nYou may also want to note in the name\nof that printer name like Sales.\n\n235\n00:14:26.364 --> 00:14:29.940\nAnd then maybe like third floor or\nsomething like that.\n\n236\n00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.008\nBecause really, we wanna remain\nefficient when we're setting this up and\n\n237\n00:14:33.008 --> 00:14:34.284\nhelp our ends users, really.\n\n238\n00:14:34.284 --> 00:14:35.388\nAnd that's what it's all about.\n\n239\n00:14:35.388 --> 00:14:38.254\nSo we'll hit Next here.\n\n240\n00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:40.693\nNow you could put the location here,\nas well.\n\n241\n00:14:40.693 --> 00:14:45.671\nSo we'll just, All right,\n\n242\n00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:50.298\nand any kind of additional comments, and\nyou could alternatively set this to go\n\n243\n00:14:50.298 --> 00:14:53.353\nahead and share out so\nothers could use that as well.\n\n244\n00:14:53.353 --> 00:14:56.080\nYou can set permissions\non printers as well,\n\n245\n00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.689\nbecause there's always that one person\nthat wants to use all the color ink.\n\n246\n00:15:00.689 --> 00:15:05.456\nSo maybe you only let them have access\nto the black and white printer, or\n\n247\n00:15:05.456 --> 00:15:08.410\nsomething like that, but we'll hit Next.\n\n248\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.550\nAnd even going through some\nof the comp tier classes and\n\n249\n00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:17.140\nyou go through their processes and\nsteps to complete a task,\n\n250\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.550\nI always feel like this is\na perfect example of how to finish\n\n251\n00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:26.338\na particular task especially\nwhen you're troubleshooting.\n\n252\n00:15:26.338 --> 00:15:30.350\nAnd you always want that validation or\nany kind of installation here.\n\n253\n00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.690\nJust to print it to make\nsure that it actually works.\n\n254\n00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.260\nAnd sometimes I even take it a step\nfurther and just have that end user print\n\n255\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.710\nfrom an application or\nsomething that they are familiar with.\n\n256\n00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.000\nSo that they are like, okay,\n\n257\n00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.330\nthey have a bit of confidence\nthis printer is set up correctly.\n\n258\n00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.233\nI'm good to go.\nI selected to print to a virtual printer\n\n259\n00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:50.870\nhere.\n\n260\n00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.418\nSo if we select print a test page,\nits gonna try to save it.\n\n261\n00:15:54.418 --> 00:15:58.581\nSo there really doesn't performance\npurpose here but I guess so\n\n262\n00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:00.748\nit is showing that it is working.\n\n263\n00:16:00.748 --> 00:16:03.598\nSo we can hit Cancel.\n\n264\n00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:06.289\nAnd it says that a test page\nhas been sent to my printer.\n\n265\n00:16:06.289 --> 00:16:07.893\nWoo hoo!\n\n266\n00:16:07.893 --> 00:16:12.785\nAll right, we'll finish this up and\nthat's one that we could,\n\n267\n00:16:12.785 --> 00:16:16.960\njust a very basic way that we\ncould add that printer in.\n\n268\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.500\nBut let's take a look at it from\nthe Server Manager perspective here.\n\n269\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.210\nNow, I will need to go ahead and\nadd a role here.\n\n270\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.870\nThe particular role that I'm going to\nbe adding is going to be my print and\n\n271\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.500\ndocument services.\n\n272\n00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.550\nSo I may need to zoom in once\nwe get to that point but\n\n273\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.780\nthis first page you guys have\nseen it a hundred times.\n\n274\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.060\nThis is that role based or\nfeature based installation, right?\n\n275\n00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.340\nWe'll hit Next, and I'm going to be\ninstalling it on my local machine here.\n\n276\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:49.678\nSo we'll hit Next, and so\nthis is where we want to zoom in.\n\n277\n00:16:49.678 --> 00:16:52.150\nPrinting and\nDocument Services, right here.\n\n278\n00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.534\nThese are gonna be my remote\nadministration tools, and\n\n279\n00:16:54.534 --> 00:16:56.570\ntime management tools,\nthat I wanna include.\n\n280\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.140\nJust make sure that this is the machine\nyou plan on managing those printers from,\n\n281\n00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.780\nif this is your Print Server.\n\n282\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.451\nThen, you wanna add those features here,\nI'll hit Next.\n\n283\n00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:11.970\nNext, and then there are some\nthings to note here on this page.\n\n284\n00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.160\nAnd it talks about different\ntypes of print drivers,\n\n285\n00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.480\nspecifically here with our type 3.\n\n286\n00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.405\nMoving forward with our Type 4 type\nprint drivers, it's more light weight,\n\n287\n00:17:23.405 --> 00:17:27.725\neasier for those vendors to go ahead and\ngenerate there.\n\n288\n00:17:27.725 --> 00:17:33.128\nSo we'll hit Next, and\non this page we're selecting\n\n289\n00:17:33.128 --> 00:17:38.330\nthe particular role services\nwe want to utilize.\n\n290\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.693\nWe wanna create a Print Server and\nthat's what we're doing right now.\n\n291\n00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:44.926\nBut in some environments,\nmaybe their focus or emphasis for\n\n292\n00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:50.910\nthis particular server is going to be for\nscanning and maintaining those documents.\n\n293\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.090\nSo we also have the option to\nutilize the Distributed Scan Server.\n\n294\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.890\nAnd we also have the ability\nto utilize internet printing,\n\n295\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:04.480\nbecause it is such a popular method\nin order to print so I could print.\n\n296\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.580\nEspecially, if I had any kind of\ntelecommuters or traveling sales people\n\n297\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:14.260\nthat wanted to print from various\nlocations, a really nice feature to have.\n\n298\n00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.420\nAnd then, I also have the ability for\nmy next based machines and\n\n299\n00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.124\nsystems to go ahead and\nset this up for our LPD Services.\n\n300\n00:18:22.124 --> 00:18:26.495\nBut I'm gonna keep this at my\nprinter server for right now and\n\n301\n00:18:26.495 --> 00:18:29.160\nwe'll hit Next, and then Install.\n\n302\n00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.150\nAll right, just give it a second it\nshouldn't take too long here, once we get\n\n303\n00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.398\nthat installed then we can take a look\nat the actual interface and play around.\n\n304\n00:18:40.398 --> 00:18:45.319\nAnd see how it's compares to that more\ntraditional control panel method that we\n\n305\n00:18:45.319 --> 00:18:46.280\njust stopped.\n\n306\n00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.850\nAll right, so it looks like we're\nsuccessful with our installation here,\n\n307\n00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:55.310\nso right here,\nsuccessfully succeeded we'll go ahead and\n\n308\n00:18:55.310 --> 00:19:00.670\nclose out and\npull up our underneath tools.\n\n309\n00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.954\nNow we should be able to see our print\n\n310\n00:19:03.954 --> 00:19:08.343\nmanagement all the way down here and\nhit Enter.\n\n311\n00:19:08.343 --> 00:19:13.448\nAnd this will bring up the print\nmanagement console for us to,\n\n312\n00:19:13.448 --> 00:19:18.274\nwell like the name implies,\nmanage our print shops here.\n\n313\n00:19:18.274 --> 00:19:22.306\nWe can also, let me zoom in so\nyou can see this, I can Add or\n\n314\n00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:24.420\nRemove Servers here as well.\n\n315\n00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.625\nSo I'm not just talking about managing\nthis particular print server, but I\n\n316\n00:19:29.625 --> 00:19:35.337\ndo have the ability to be managing remote\nservers as well, so that's pretty cool.\n\n317\n00:19:35.337 --> 00:19:37.470\nWhat do I wanna look at first here?\n\n318\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.250\nLet's go a head and\n\n319\n00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.890\nexpand out our Print Servers over\non the left hand side over here.\n\n320\n00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:49.280\nThis is where I see my local machine, and\nI have a couple different options here.\n\n321\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.166\nAnd also above that different ways that\nthey categorize the different printers,\n\n322\n00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:57.640\nwhich is really nice to\nhelp you find them easily.\n\n323\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.810\nBut let's just select Printers right now\nand we should see that printer that we\n\n324\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:07.300\njust created, and there it is,\nour sales third floor right there.\n\n325\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.115\nWe can see that it's in a ready state.\n\n326\n00:20:09.115 --> 00:20:14.465\nAnd we can get additional\ninformation about what Print Server\n\n327\n00:20:14.465 --> 00:20:18.515\nis responsible for that particular print\ndevice, so the different drivers and\n\n328\n00:20:18.515 --> 00:20:20.675\ndriver version information.\n\n329\n00:20:20.675 --> 00:20:22.795\nNow, that brings us to another idea.\n\n330\n00:20:22.795 --> 00:20:24.225\nWell what about drivers, right?\n\n331\n00:20:24.225 --> 00:20:25.475\nSo if I'm talking about, so\n\n332\n00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:29.930\nthe print server that is accessed\ncentrally to handle all these print jobs.\n\n333\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.300\nWhat about clients that are connecting?\n\n334\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.970\nAre they going to be on a 64-bit\narchitecture, 32-bit architecture?\n\n335\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.650\nThat's definitely something to consider,\n\n336\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.600\nespecially them like with some\nof our Windows 7 machines.\n\n337\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.415\nSo just knowing your environment, and\nif you're not sure then maybe you just\n\n338\n00:20:45.415 --> 00:20:48.945\nwanna go ahead and add them both for\nparticular partners anyways.\n\n339\n00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:52.845\nAnd that, this is where you would do that\nright here, on the right hand side there's\n\n340\n00:20:52.845 --> 00:20:56.765\na section that says drivers, so just\nright click and then select add drivers.\n\n341\n00:20:56.765 --> 00:21:00.435\nAnd that will walk you\nthrough in add driver wizard.\n\n342\n00:21:00.435 --> 00:21:07.540\nPretty straight forward,\nnothing too crazy here,\n\n343\n00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:13.040\nit's just as look, are we gonna be talking\nabout our 64 bit or 32 bit architecture.\n\n344\n00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.240\nAnd you might wanna add\na couple of those in.\n\n345\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.600\nAnd so\nwe'll just add like the one here for\n\n346\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.730\nthat particular printer\nthat we had selected.\n\n347\n00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.740\nIt really doesn't matter but\n\n348\n00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.350\nthat's how you would, how you would\ndo that pretty straightforward.\n\n349\n00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:31.225\n&gt;&gt; And now this is an emphasis point\nthat we would have made probably\n\n350\n00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:33.250\nin 2008 more than 2012.\n\n351\n00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.454\nBut do remember that if you're having an\nissue printing you do need to take a look\n\n352\n00:21:37.454 --> 00:21:39.732\nat the operating system that's running.\n\n353\n00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:42.336\nWhether it's 32-bit or 64-bit and\n\n354\n00:21:42.336 --> 00:21:46.465\nmake sure that the driver is\nalso gonna be matching that.\n\n355\n00:21:46.465 --> 00:21:49.255\nSo remember that if you have\na 64-bit operating system,\n\n356\n00:21:49.255 --> 00:21:52.285\nrunning a 32-bit driver is\nprobably not gonna work.\n\n357\n00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:55.225\nAnd the same thing if you have\na 32-bit operating system,\n\n358\n00:21:55.225 --> 00:21:59.270\na 64-bit driver is also not\ngoing to work with that either.\n\n359\n00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.556\nSo, in those instances,\nwhere you might end up in a scenario,\n\n360\n00:22:02.556 --> 00:22:05.538\nwhere they're saying there\nis a printing problem here.\n\n361\n00:22:05.538 --> 00:22:10.642\nAnd they give you a list of machines that\nyou might have ten Windows 8 machines,\n\n362\n00:22:10.642 --> 00:22:16.450\nand a Windows 10 machine and then, you're\nstill running a 32 bit Windows 7 machine.\n\n363\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:20.010\nYour Windows 7 machine\nis not able to print.\n\n364\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.100\nWell, what could one of the issues be?\n\n365\n00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.560\nIt could be just as simple\nas that check mark and\n\n366\n00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.720\nmaking sure you have that 32 bit driver\nthere, and make sure that ends up working.\n\n367\n00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.070\nIt seems logical enough untill\nyou're put into that scenario and\n\n368\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.250\nyou don't think about it, and\nyou just think what I do.\n\n369\n00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.910\nYou download the print driver and\nyou install it, that's all should be done.\n\n370\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.449\nBut today though, we tend to be\nmore 64-bit than we are 32-bit.\n\n371\n00:22:43.449 --> 00:22:45.703\nThere was that point in time\nwhen it wasn't that way.\n\n372\n00:22:45.703 --> 00:22:48.957\nAnd you might still be running into those\nsystems where you will have a mix of that\n\n373\n00:22:48.957 --> 00:22:50.870\nenvironment that's still out there.\n\n374\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.659\nSo don't overlook it,\neven though it's fairly simple.\n\n375\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:59.567\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's a good point,\nRonny, just things to consider, right,\n\n376\n00:22:59.567 --> 00:23:02.269\nabout how your network is really created.\n\n377\n00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:05.796\nBecause if you think about that\ndiagram that I showed you originally,\n\n378\n00:23:05.796 --> 00:23:08.300\neven looking here at the queue status.\n\n379\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.810\nAnd if you think about the main reason as\nto why we're even doing this, it really is\n\n380\n00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:17.150\nto make things easier, not more difficult\nhaving people have driver issues and\n\n381\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.620\nproblems like that, but\nthe concept is look, if I had.\n\n382\n00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.410\nSo you think well why wouldn't I just\nset up a network based printer and\n\n383\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.640\nhave my end users connect to that.\n\n384\n00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.726\nWell, if you think about it,\n\n385\n00:23:29.726 --> 00:23:34.323\neach individual end user is\nresponsible for this print devices.\n\n386\n00:23:34.323 --> 00:23:38.986\nAnd they're all set on those individual\nmachines connecting back to that print\n\n387\n00:23:38.986 --> 00:23:40.110\ndevice.\n\n388\n00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.981\nBut here, with the server,\nthose print jobs are gonna be managed and\n\n389\n00:23:43.981 --> 00:23:46.138\nmaintained in one central location.\n\n390\n00:23:46.138 --> 00:23:50.403\nSo that if there's a problem and I need to\ngo ahead and flush out that print queue,\n\n391\n00:23:50.403 --> 00:23:53.300\nor anything like that,\nthen I would be able to do so.\n\n392\n00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.683\nSo all in all,\nit is a good idea to go ahead and\n\n393\n00:23:56.683 --> 00:24:00.258\nset this up, and\nit's not difficult as well.\n\n394\n00:24:00.258 --> 00:24:04.720\nNow if you're using a Active Directory\nintegrated environment,\n\n395\n00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.275\nthen there's that really easy way\nto go ahead and add that printer.\n\n396\n00:24:09.275 --> 00:24:14.568\nIn Active Directory because\nthe method that we saw by setting\n\n397\n00:24:14.568 --> 00:24:20.730\nup a printer is great for\nthe sporadic installations of printers.\n\n398\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.040\nBut what if you're talking about\na widescale deployment of printers?\n\n399\n00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.350\nActive Directory and Group Policy is\ngoing to be an easy way to go about that.\n\n400\n00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:34.890\nSo If I look at my screen here, I can see\nthat Sales Printer that we've created,\n\n401\n00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.590\nand let's go ahead and\nright-click on that and\n\n402\n00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:42.030\nthen there should be an option third\ndown that says List in Directory.\n\n403\n00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.550\nSo we need to enable that printer\nto be added to the directory.\n\n404\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.080\nSo let's just take a look\nat what that looks like\n\n405\n00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.440\nfrom the Active Directory side of things.\n\n406\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.620\nAnd so under Tools, so\nobviously you have to have,\n\n407\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.770\nI'm on a machine that already has\nActive Directory Services installed.\n\n408\n00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.772\nSo I have Active Directory Users\n&amp; Computers.\n\n409\n00:25:01.772 --> 00:25:05.462\nAnd we'll pull that up and\nzoom in a little bit so\n\n410\n00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:07.775\nwe can see this tiny writing.\n\n411\n00:25:07.775 --> 00:25:12.315\nNow, if I go ahead and\nexpand out my domain over here and\n\n412\n00:25:12.315 --> 00:25:14.405\nlet's see, I do a Find.\n\n413\n00:25:14.405 --> 00:25:18.980\nRight-click and then Find,\nthere's going to be a drop-down.\n\n414\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.910\nInstead of looking for\nUsers, Contacts and Groups,\n\n415\n00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:27.550\nI also have the ability to see\ndifferent printers in my environment.\n\n416\n00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.760\nAnd we'll just hit Find now.\n\n417\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.280\nSo since I didn't put anything in there,\nit would show all the printers that were\n\n418\n00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.450\nlisted to be registered here\nwithin Active Directory.\n\n419\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:43.480\nSo this may be another option\njust to simplify that process.\n\n420\n00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.560\nLet's go ahead and register that printer\nin Active Directory, and we can either\n\n421\n00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.170\naccess it through on an individual basis\nor push it out, like with Group Policy.\n\n422\n00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:57.540\nAll right, and what are some other things\nwe wanna take a look at while we're here?\n\n423\n00:26:01.182 --> 00:26:03.950\nLet's see, migrating print servers.\n\n424\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.460\nWe do have the ability to\nmigrate print servers,\n\n425\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.240\nso once once we get a print server all set\nup just like with a lot of other roles and\n\n426\n00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.730\nfeatures that we have available to us.\n\n427\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.230\nWe don't wanna lose those settings,\n\n428\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.028\nso you can migrate right within\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n429\n00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:23.240\nThere's also printBRM.exe utility to\ngo ahead, so you have the ability\n\n430\n00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:29.550\nto either use the migration wizard or\nyou can use that executable.\n\n431\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.250\nWe also need to note\nthe Easy Print driver.\n\n432\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:36.835\nSo older systems, you guys might\nhave heard if you've been working in\n\n433\n00:26:36.835 --> 00:26:40.020\nthe industry for\na while like terminal systems.\n\n434\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.960\nIf you have a dom terminal\nconnecting back to a machine and\n\n435\n00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.514\npulling its operating system down.\n\n436\n00:26:46.514 --> 00:26:49.536\nAnd now if we have\nRemote Desktop Services,\n\n437\n00:26:49.536 --> 00:26:54.113\nif it's being utilized when we're\naccessing systems remotely,\n\n438\n00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:58.390\nwe weren't always able to\nprint to our local machines.\n\n439\n00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:02.990\nSo if I was connecting out to\na remote system, I do now have\n\n440\n00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.740\nthe ability with the Easy Print driver to\ngo ahead and print to my local device.\n\n441\n00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.300\nSo that's just something\nelse to configure.\n\n442\n00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:16.170\nWe looked at drivers, we talked about\nprinter spooling and how that is handled.\n\n443\n00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.212\nI do have a couple options.\n\n444\n00:27:17.212 --> 00:27:19.531\nI have the option to print immediately.\n\n445\n00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:23.310\nSo as soon as I'm sending that job,\nit's printing right away.\n\n446\n00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:27.270\nI have the option to start printing\nafter the last page is spooled.\n\n447\n00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.160\nI have the ability to hold\nmismatched documents.\n\n448\n00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:38.600\nSo let's just say you had\nsent an A4-sized print job\n\n449\n00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.870\nto a printer that was handling larger\npieces of paper, so it was an accident.\n\n450\n00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.500\nSo that printer has the ability with\nthat spooler setting to go ahead and\n\n451\n00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.060\nhold that mismatched job and\nlet the administrator handle it.\n\n452\n00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.490\nYou may want to consider that for\n\n453\n00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.570\nsecurity purposes as well any\ntime information is being cached,\n\n454\n00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.750\nit may be against your security policy but\njust keep that in mind.\n\n455\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.470\nYou have the option to print\nspooled documents first, and\n\n456\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.680\nthen you also have the option to keep\ndocuments after they were printed.\n\n457\n00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.309\nSo you keep that information there\nstored on that printer, so again,\n\n458\n00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:17.220\njust something to think about for\nyou guys.\n\n459\n00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.107\nNow, I'm looking at the clock,\nI don't know,\n\n460\n00:28:19.107 --> 00:28:21.097\ndo you think I have time\nto cover print priorities?\n\n461\n00:28:21.097 --> 00:28:26.201\nNo, Ronnie's giving me the no here,\nso we have a lot to cover still,\n\n462\n00:28:26.201 --> 00:28:31.750\nso this will be a good place to go ahead\nand just break, maybe for a part two.\n\n463\n00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.689\nHopefully we won't have\nan extreme multi series here.\n\n464\n00:28:34.689 --> 00:28:37.840\nBut there's a lot with printing, and it's\ndefinitely worth covering all of that.\n\n465\n00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.235\nSo I think that's about it for now.\n\n466\n00:28:40.235 --> 00:28:43.081\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, thank you\nagain for helping us out here and\n\n467\n00:28:43.081 --> 00:28:46.020\nlearning a little bit more\nabout configuring printers.\n\n468\n00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.700\nConfiguring printers is one of the things\nthat you will have to be able to do.\n\n469\n00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.690\nAnd on the exam,\nit is going to be heavily tested.\n\n470\n00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.000\nAnd the reason why is that, in businesses\nif you can't get the email working,\n\n471\n00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.240\nif you can't get printers going, that's\ngonna be harsh of an environment for\n\n472\n00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.140\nyou to work in.\n\n473\n00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.310\nSo understanding the basics of printers,\nand\n\n474\n00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:09.481\nunderstanding the configurations\nthat they're in, all of this is\n\n475\n00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:12.832\na good piece of information that you\nshould review over and over again.\n\n476\n00:29:12.832 --> 00:29:16.749\nAnd put yourself in the scenarios in\nwhich somebody does need a printer and\n\n477\n00:29:16.749 --> 00:29:18.341\nhere's where it needs to be.\n\n478\n00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:21.347\nOr somebody needs this but\nit's too slow, whatever it might be,\n\n479\n00:29:21.347 --> 00:29:25.620\nthese are different scenarios you need to\nthink about before heading into the exam.\n\n480\n00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.100\nAs well as what may need\nto be configured for\n\n481\n00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.070\nyou to make them work the way\nthat we want them to as well.\n\n482\n00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.670\nBut there is a lot more to come on\nprinting and we are saving that for\n\n483\n00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.050\nanother show then.\n\n484\n00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.250\nSo signing off for ITProTV.\n\n485\n00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.740\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n486\n00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n487\n00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:46.826\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410

the show.\n\n12\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.020\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.140\nHow are you doing today?\n\n14\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.110\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\nNow Cherokee, printers, of course,\n\n15\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.010\nis a big area that we have to consider\nas we start to prepare for the MCSA.\n\n16\n00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.480\nEverybody essentially needs emails and\nprinters.\n\n17\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.790\nAnd we've already talked about\nthe idea of adding in printers.\n\n18\n00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.870\nSeems simple enough, but\nin an enterprise environment,\n\n19\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.020\nit may get a little bit\nmore complicated than that.\n\n20\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.940\nSo, Cherokee, where are we picking up now?\n\n21\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, so\nwe did cover a lot in the first show.\n\n22\n00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.960\nAnd I just kinda wanna reiterate and\njust refresh on some of those terms, and\n\n23\n00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.340\nactually show you where those would\nbe located in an operating system, so\n\n24\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.630\nit makes a little bit more sense.\n\n25\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.910\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n26\n00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.560\nNow in our print management console that\nI've pulled up, this is going to be that\n\n27\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.050\nsame printer that we were working with\nbefore right here, Sales Third floor.\n\n28\n00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.120\nSo let's just right click, and\nexamine the Print properties,\n\n29\n00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.560\nbecause it is extremely important to\nknow all the individual tabs, and\n\n30\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.930\nwhere we would go and\naccess these components.\n\n31\n00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.049\nSo let me zoom out a little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.810\nSome of the UI here is very\nsimilar to what you may\n\n33\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.940\nalready be familiar with for client\nside configuration, so that's a plus.\n\n34\n00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940\nWe've got the name of our printer here,\n\n35\n00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.410\nthe location,\nany kind of additional comments.\n\n36\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.950\nNow this part right here, the model,\nand then any kind of features will\n\n37\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.670\nbe contingent upon the features that\nthat model does have available.\n\n38\n00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.930\nOur 600 dpi there,\n\n39\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.070\ndifferent types of paper trays\nthat are supported for our paper.\n\n40\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.410\nFormats that are supported, all right?\n\n41\n00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.250\nThat's just the general, now sharing.\n\n42\n00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.100\nSharing, again we've talked\nabout sharing before.\n\n43\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.860\nWe could share the printer,\nyou could change the name of the printer,\n\n44\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.260\njust like we could have changed any\nkind of folder or volume shares as well.\n\n45\n00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.950\nNow this is going to be whether we want to\nrender the jobs on either client side or\n\n46\n00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.930\non the printer, we spoke about\nthat on the memory considerations,\n\n47\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.670\nif you are gonna be rendering or\neven spooling to that printer.\n\n48\n00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.480\nAnd then listing in active directory,\n\n49\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.420\nwe also looked at that when we\ncreated our printers walls.\n\n50\n00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.780\nSo that's going to go ahead and\n\n51\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.890\nadded into that giant phonebook\nof active directory essentially.\n\n52\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.770\nNow, with ports, so\nwe have our different types of ports.\n\n53\n00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.160\nYou guys have probably\nlearned about this in A plus.\n\n54\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.840\nWhen we set this particular printer up,\n\n55\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.700\nwe just chose our prompt port\nto go ahead and print to file.\n\n56\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.840\nSo, it will prompt us to select a location\nwhere we want to go ahead and save that.\n\n57\n00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.450\nNotice though, if I wanted to change the\nport on this particular printer I could.\n\n58\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.380\nBut I cannot have more\nthan one port selected,\n\n59\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.230\nand that is because,\nif you think about it logically,\n\n60\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.200\nthat port is what is binding or\nmarrying us to the physical print device.\n\n61\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.200\nLet's take a pause from looking at\nthis real quick, and let's look at\n\n62\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.510\na diagram that I wanna show you,\njust to explain a couple of concepts.\n\n63\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.890\nHere, let me go back one,\n\n64\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.870\nnope, and my printer queue is\nspelled wrong there as well, Ronnie.\n\n65\n00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.125\nI must have copied and paste.\n\n66\n00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about a couple different\n\n67\n00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.010\nconfigurations here.\n\n68\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.650\nSo with printer pooling,\nlet's see what that really means, okay.\n\n69\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.700\nThis little tiny yellow printer\nis set up on that print server,\n\n70\n00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.530\nbecause remember, Printer is that printer\nsoftware from Microsoft terminology.\n\n71\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.350\nAnd these are my print devices.\n\n72\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.410\nI can only have one port.\n\n73\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.650\nLet's just theoretically say that these\nlines are referencing those ports for\n\n74\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.430\nthat printer.\n\n75\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:38.380\nBut what if I had one logical printer, one\nsoftware printer, two physical printers,\n\n76\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.580\nand I can print to it in a round robin\nstyle fashion, so that's printer pooling.\n\n77\n00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.730\nWe talked about that a little bit,\nbut if I go back to that lab here.\n\n78\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.620\nThat's gonna be in Edge.\n\n79\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.290\nWe can enable printer pooling simply\nby enabling this check box right here.\n\n80\n00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.550\nSo what that means, now I could select\nan additional port to go ahead and\n\n81\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.230\nbind to another physical print device.\n\n82\n00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.490\nSo what that means is,\nfrom the client side,\n\n83\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.600\nthey only see that one software printer.\n\n84\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.730\nBut they're two physical print devices.\n\n85\n00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.290\nSo if I have a high volume amount\nof printing happening, then that\n\n86\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.190\nprint job will be sent to a printer, if\nit's available, whichever one's available.\n\n87\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.957\nSo that's print pooling, all right?\n\n88\n00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:32.630\nPretty cool concept.\n\n89\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.350\nAnd, you know, sometimes in documents,\nRonnie, if I can even talk today.\n\n90\n00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.118\n&gt;&gt; Documentation?\n\n91\n00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:43.660\n&gt;&gt; Documentation, yeah,\nthat, it'll say hey,\n\n92\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.440\nyou have to have the exact same\nprinter to set up printer pooling.\n\n93\n00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.020\nBut that's not necessarily true.\n\n94\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.810\nWith newer printers nowadays,\n\n95\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.520\nthe manufacturers have made kind of,\nit's not as bad as it used to be.\n\n96\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.620\nPrinter drivers used to be very picky,\nand wouldn't\n\n97\n00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.480\nwork very well at all across different\nmakes within that manufacturer's line.\n\n98\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.340\nBut nowadays,\na lot of print devices can share drivers.\n\n99\n00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.810\nSo if you have multiple print\ndevices that use the same driver,\n\n100\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.700\nthen print pooling will work, but that's\njust something that you may need to test.\n\n101\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.700\nIf you're plan on, kind of, not getting\nthe exact same make and model, FYI.\n\n102\n00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.250\nAll right.\n\n103\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.230\nNow if we look at my screen again, I just\nwanna go through the remaining tabs here.\n\n104\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.940\nSo Advanced is going to offer\nyour some advanced options.\n\n105\n00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.590\nCurrently this printer is always\navailable, but let's say I had a very\n\n106\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.220\nrigid or strict policy, as to when\npeople were allowed in the building, so\n\n107\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.800\nwhy would I need to have this printer on,\nif no one is even in the building.\n\n108\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.930\nYou could restrict that\nby time restrictions.\n\n109\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.670\nAnd we'll get to priority\nhere in a minute.\n\n110\n00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.200\nI want to go back to that diagram,\nbefore I continue with that concept.\n\n111\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.700\nWe also spoke about print pooling, right?\n\n112\n00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.560\nSo print spoiling,\n\n113\n00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.840\nI can spool documents, so\nthat the program finishes printing faster.\n\n114\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.830\nSo we just need to kind\nof think about that,\n\n115\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.910\nbecause I will also show you a scenario.\n\n116\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.690\nSo all of these factors come into play,\n\n117\n00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.920\nwhen we're talking about which job is\ngetting sent to that printer first, okay?\n\n118\n00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.000\nSo looking at these configurations here.\n\n119\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.230\nNow remember, so on this particular\noptions, start printing immediately.\n\n120\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.710\nThat means that the job does not have\nto be completely spooled on that\n\n121\n00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.410\nprint device in order for\nit to begin that print job.\n\n122\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.890\nSo, it's just gonna start printing.\n\n123\n00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.417\nSo, it's happening really fast,\n\n124\n00:07:43.417 --> 00:07:46.962\nbut nothing is cached there\non that print device.\n\n125\n00:07:46.962 --> 00:07:52.931\nWe have the ability, like we spoke about,\nto hold those mismatched documents,so for\n\n126\n00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:58.572\nwhatever reason that printer is not able\nto facilitate the job you sent, it will go\n\n127\n00:07:58.572 --> 00:08:05.390\nahead and hold that so It's not just lost,\nand you can go in and adjust if necessary.\n\n128\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.150\nAll right,\njust a couple other options here.\n\n129\n00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.470\nYou even see additional\nadvanced options here.\n\n130\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.360\nNext we have a color management tab, and\n\n131\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.170\nthis is where I said sometimes you may\nneed to go in and modify this information.\n\n132\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.890\nYou can set up profiles,\neven looking at your advanced information.\n\n133\n00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.200\nBut just know that that's where\nyou would go to go in and\n\n134\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.009\nmodify those color options.\n\n135\n00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.250\nAll right,\nlet's go back to this idea right here.\n\n136\n00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.161\nI said I wanted to talk\nabout this priority before\n\n137\n00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:39.520\nwe move too far down the list here.\n\n138\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.730\nSo let me pull back up\nthis simple diagram, and\n\n139\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.610\nhopefully this will put it\ninto perspective for you.\n\n140\n00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.300\nIf we take a look at our printer\npriorities here at the bottom,\n\n141\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.210\nI have two clients here, right?\n\n142\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.001\nI have one physical print device.\n\n143\n00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:58.380\nNow this is just an example of\na configuration that would be used with\n\n144\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.080\nprinter priorities.\n\n145\n00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.570\nBut let's say this client over here\nis my CEO or something like that.\n\n146\n00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.416\nAnd maybe this is, I don't know,\n\n147\n00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:14.334\nI always hate trivializing\nsomeone's role or something.\n\n148\n00:09:14.334 --> 00:09:15.276\n&gt;&gt; Just say Ronnie.\n\n149\n00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:17.299\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, okay [LAUGH].\n\n150\n00:09:17.299 --> 00:09:19.762\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here's Ronnie over here.\n\n151\n00:09:19.762 --> 00:09:26.300\nOkay, so our CEO wants to always\nhave their documents printed first.\n\n152\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.310\nThey don't want to wait on Ronnie's\n500 page document to finish\n\n153\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.630\nout in this printer.\n\n154\n00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:36.225\nSo each one of these clients is\ninstalled with a logical printer,\n\n155\n00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:40.135\nbecause that's how they communicate\nwith that physical print device.\n\n156\n00:09:40.135 --> 00:09:43.665\nBut the settings on each one\nof these logical printers,\n\n157\n00:09:43.665 --> 00:09:44.655\nwhen you're installing them.\n\n158\n00:09:44.655 --> 00:09:46.445\nAnd I should say software printer,\n\n159\n00:09:46.445 --> 00:09:50.795\nthe software printer can\nbe set with a priority.\n\n160\n00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:53.815\nAnd that's exactly what we\nare looking at over here.\n\n161\n00:09:53.815 --> 00:09:58.517\nSo this particular field right here,\nif I were to go ahead and\n\n162\n00:09:58.517 --> 00:10:03.327\nenter in right here,\nthis is going to set my priority levels.\n\n163\n00:10:03.327 --> 00:10:06.320\nHowever, it's kind of strange here,\nall right?\n\n164\n00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.731\nSo you might think, hey Ronnie,\nRonnie's number one, right?\n\n165\n00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:11.810\nThat's not how it works.\n\n166\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.381\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n167\n00:10:12.381 --> 00:10:18.606\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So the way that I think\nabout it is the higher the number,\n\n168\n00:10:18.606 --> 00:10:23.650\nthe higher the priority,\nand that's what it is.\n\n169\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.777\nSo if I put a 99 in here,\nif my numlocks is on.\n\n170\n00:10:27.777 --> 00:10:32.170\nThere we go, 99 is the highest priority.\n\n171\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:37.830\nSo 99 would be essentially numero\nuno in this configuration setting.\n\n172\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n173\n00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.371\n&gt;&gt; I know, but it is what it is.\n\n174\n00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:43.330\nI can't make this stuff up, guys.\n\n175\n00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.750\nSo any time you want a number, and\n\n176\n00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.980\nit really doesn't matter if,\nlet's say I put 89 in here.\n\n177\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.832\nIf I had 89 versus 1, then 89 is gonna\nprint before 1, that's how it works.\n\n178\n00:10:58.832 --> 00:11:03.609\nNow, if I had three printers,\nor three clients with one\n\n179\n00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:08.400\nphysical printer, and\nI had a 99, an 89, and a 1.\n\n180\n00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.545\nThen it would be in descending order for\nthat triage or that priority there.\n\n181\n00:11:14.545 --> 00:11:19.351\nSo the client configured with\na 99 priority would always\n\n182\n00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:22.008\nhave precedence over the 89.\n\n183\n00:11:22.008 --> 00:11:26.660\nAnd the 89 would always have precedence\nover the 1, if that makes sense.\n\n184\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.456\nBut it is important to know, because again\nthat does effect the overall outcome of\n\n185\n00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:36.248\nhow that printing order works, and you may\nsee scenarios like that in the future if\n\n186\n00:11:36.248 --> 00:11:38.281\nyou are planning to take the exam.\n\n187\n00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:41.241\nAll right, moving on here.\n\n188\n00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:43.688\nI do wanna take a look\nat security as well.\n\n189\n00:11:43.688 --> 00:11:47.330\nWe've talked about security and\npermissions in other episodes.\n\n190\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.569\nAnd we do have this same tab here,\nbecause we can apply security to printers.\n\n191\n00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:56.419\nWe were kind of joking in the last show\nabout not letting Ronnie have access to\n\n192\n00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:57.450\nthe color printer.\n\n193\n00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.555\nBut in real life, this is something\nthat you really may wanna consider,\n\n194\n00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:03.700\nbecause it happens.\n\n195\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.920\nWhen you install a printer,\nby default the everyone group\n\n196\n00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.370\nallows, you get to the security principle\nright here, the everyone group.\n\n197\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.910\nAnd so by default,\neveryone is allowed to print, all right?\n\n198\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.650\nHowever, we do see a couple\ndifferent options here, and\n\n199\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.140\nlets just cover those real quick.\n\n200\n00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.150\nSo manage the printer, like it sounds.\n\n201\n00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:32.980\nWe're able to utilize management\nutilities such as deleting print jobs,\n\n202\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.950\nsetting priorities, setting availability,\nand that's what that means.\n\n203\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.380\nIf you wanted to go ahead and\ndelegate any kind of management functions,\n\n204\n00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.960\nthen you would select that option.\n\n205\n00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.282\nNow to manage documents,\nthis gives the right to go ahead and\n\n206\n00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:47.728\nmanage those print jobs.\n\n207\n00:12:47.728 --> 00:12:51.536\nSo if you had documents kinda clogging\nup in the print queue and something\n\n208\n00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:55.860\nwasn't working and you were trying to\ngo through rudimentary troubleshooting.\n\n209\n00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.372\nClearing out that print queue, pausing or\n\n210\n00:12:58.372 --> 00:13:03.128\nrestarting a job, then you would be able\nto do that with this particular rights.\n\n211\n00:13:03.128 --> 00:13:08.070\nAnd then again, we also see the ability\nto set special permissions if you\n\n212\n00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.608\nwanted to granularly set those\nunique permissions such as print,\n\n213\n00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:15.780\nmanage printers, read, and so forth there.\n\n214\n00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.430\nSo that's something to\nthink about as well.\n\n215\n00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.910\n&gt;&gt; Now this is kind of an unusual\nsituation here when you start looking at\n\n216\n00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.160\nthe idea of the managed printers and\nthe idea of the managed documents.\n\n217\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.763\nVery easy to get them confused,\nbut do pay attention especially\n\n218\n00:13:29.763 --> 00:13:33.041\nto what permissions that\nthe managed documents give you.\n\n219\n00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.350\nCherokee, if we go back to you screen for\na moment.\n\n220\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.170\nLet's kind of just do this.\n\n221\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.800\nJust go ahead and click on where it\nsays Manage Printers for right now.\n\n222\n00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.795\nManage this printer, and\nput a check box in the, yep.\n\n223\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.320\nIt's not actually showing up, but usually\nwhat you end up getting, of course,\n\n224\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.780\nis the ability to print,\nas well as manage a printer and\n\n225\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.980\neven documents that's actually there.\n\n226\n00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.820\nBut if you were just to kind of remove\neverything, you'd end up seeing that if\n\n227\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.350\nyou selected the Manage Documents,\nyou don't really get the ability to print.\n\n228\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.860\nSo let's take from example\nthat I am a supervisor and\n\n229\n00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.140\nCherokee assigned me Manage Documents.\n\n230\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.260\nIt sounds great, sounds like a great\nidea here, because now I can actually\n\n231\n00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.940\nmanage the documents of other people that\nmay be working for me as a supervisor.\n\n232\n00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.610\nBut I go and try and print,\nand then I can't print myself.\n\n233\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.840\nAnd so if you don't think about it,\nwith that idea of the Manage Documents,\n\n234\n00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.450\nyou may find yourself with the ability\nto manage Cherokee's documents, but\n\n235\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.810\nnot the ability to print yourself.\n\n236\n00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.663\nSo that's kind of something that can get\nyou if you're not paying attention there,\n\n237\n00:14:35.663 --> 00:14:37.081\nso make sure you realize that.\n\n238\n00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:40.879\nUsually on the everyone group, everybody\ngets the ability to print, which is great.\n\n239\n00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.300\nBut Manage Printers, of course,\n\n240\n00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.300\ngives you that ability to print as\nwell as manage other documents.\n\n241\n00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.150\nBut Manage Documents, though,\nyou don't get the ability to print.\n\n242\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nmake sure that's selected as well, yeah.\n\n243\n00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, make sure you check it.\n\n244\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.499\n&gt;&gt; And you have to think about that, too.\n\n245\n00:14:52.499 --> 00:14:56.374\nSo if I only gave Ronnie that Manage\nDocuments permission and then I said\n\n246\n00:14:56.374 --> 00:15:01.200\nto him, hey, I need you to go and change\nthat priority, like we just talked about.\n\n247\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.130\nWell, he wouldn't be able to do\nthat because that's a printer\n\n248\n00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.020\nmanagement function,\nnot a document management function.\n\n249\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.590\nSo that's something to consider\nalso when you're doling those out.\n\n250\n00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.840\nAnd you also need to make sure that\nwhomever you're assigning those positions\n\n251\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.920\nto is a part of one of these three groups,\nall right?\n\n252\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.090\nWe have the print operators group,\nwe have the server operators, and\n\n253\n00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.780\nthen we also have the local admins,\n\n254\n00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.300\nwhich also include the domain admins\nif you're in a domain environment.\n\n255\n00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.380\nSo whomever you're delegating\nthose permissions to\n\n256\n00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.889\nshould also be a part of one of those\nthree groups, just so you know that.\n\n257\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.198\nAnd let's see here, for device settings,\nagain this is just gonna be some of\n\n258\n00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:46.961\nthe basic settings that you guys\nare probably already familiar with.\n\n259\n00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:49.218\nI wanted to walk through those steps,\n\n260\n00:15:49.218 --> 00:15:52.260\nbecause I know we spoke\nabout them in the last show.\n\n261\n00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.833\nBut seeing exactly where\neverything is located,\n\n262\n00:15:54.833 --> 00:15:58.087\nI can't even explain how important\nthis is for you on the exam.\n\n263\n00:15:58.087 --> 00:16:02.754\nBecause setting up printers is\nsomething that I wanna say,\n\n264\n00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:07.698\nI was, I hate using those terms\nlike everyone, and always, or\n\n265\n00:16:07.698 --> 00:16:12.040\nnever, but\nI mean it's hard to get out of printer/s.\n\n266\n00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.980\nSo we'll just hit Okay for\nnow, and let's see.\n\n267\n00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.690\nI wanna talk about the easy print driver,\n\n268\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.640\nI've mentioned it before, but\nthe easy print driver as a matter of fact.\n\n269\n00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.000\nSo my labs, Ronnie,\nweren't working 100% this morning, and\n\n270\n00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.600\nyet you suggested here that I go ahead and\nremote into them, so\n\n271\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.790\nwe've got them up and running so\nwe could do this show for you guys.\n\n272\n00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.920\nBut if you note here on my screen,\nI have some printers that are actually on\n\n273\n00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.900\na different server, and\nthis printer 1, 2 and 3.\n\n274\n00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.690\nSo these printers are actually\non a server named PLABDML1,\n\n275\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.706\nand you can see how it\nsays redirected here.\n\n276\n00:16:54.706 --> 00:16:59.780\nSo easy print drivers are essentially\na way that we can redirect\n\n277\n00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.170\nprinters to print to a local machine, and\n\n278\n00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.290\nyou'll see that easy print\ndriver option available,\n\n279\n00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:14.390\nif it is configured in an environment\nthat is utilizing remote desktop.\n\n280\n00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.220\nSo if I'm not utilizing any kind of\nremote desktop per terminal services,\n\n281\n00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.910\nthen I'm not gonna really be too\nworried about the Easy Print driver.\n\n282\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:26.870\nNow by default,\nit is enabled from 2008 and beyond.\n\n283\n00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.730\nBut let me just show you, also,\nand I have it in the show notes.\n\n284\n00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.900\nA URL here, for\n\n285\n00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.900\nwhere you would go in through group\npolicy management and modify that,\n\n286\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:45.260\nif for some reason you wanted the driver\nbehavior to act in a specific way.\n\n287\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:49.320\nThey have a couple different configuration\noptions here, that you could go ahead and\n\n288\n00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.550\nmanipulate that.\n\n289\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.920\nAnd this is the actual location for that\npolicy, as to where you would go ahead and\n\n290\n00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.870\ngrab that under computer configuration,\nand then here just some examples of,\n\n291\n00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.700\nyou know?\n\n292\n00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.489\nFor instance, if I follow this\nparticular path right here,\n\n293\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.360\nif I use this policy and I set it to\nDisabled, then the terminal server first\n\n294\n00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.320\nwill try to find a suitable printer\ndriver to install the client printer.\n\n295\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.920\nBut if that terminal server does not\nhave a printer driver that matches with\n\n296\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.600\nthe client, then the server tries to use\nthe terminal service's easy print driver\n\n297\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.400\nto install to the client printer.\n\n298\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.030\nSo that's just something\nto think about as well.\n\n299\n00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.160\nRon, have you got a question?\n\n300\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now Cherokee, we do have to be\ncareful here on this particular link.\n\n301\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.742\nYou do show it's going to 2008, but\nremember that there was kind of a rename\n\n302\n00:18:34.742 --> 00:18:38.229\nof Terminal Services after 2008\n[CROSSTALK] you've been working in 2008.\n\n303\n00:18:38.229 --> 00:18:39.913\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Here we go.\n\n304\n00:18:39.913 --> 00:18:43.930\n&gt;&gt; That means that instead of the terminal\nservices, you're gonna look for\n\n305\n00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.394\nremote desktop services as normally\n\n306\n00:18:46.394 --> 00:18:47.464\nend up [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n307\n00:18:47.464 --> 00:18:50.710\nall those supporting [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And that can be important because when\n\n308\n00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.801\nyou start to see this, it's easy like for\nme You know my mind automatically went\n\n309\n00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:59.650\nto look for terminal services, because I'd\nbeen setting up terminal services in 2008.\n\n310\n00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're showing our age, right?\n\n311\n00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.130\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen when you actually go to 2012 and\n\n312\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.250\nR2 and some remote desktop services,\nyou kind of get lost when you go hey,\n\n313\n00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.500\nterminal services,\nthat setting has disappeared.\n\n314\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:17.190\nSo just kinda be aware that that may\nactually show something different instead,\n\n315\n00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.160\nwhich is gonna be remote desktop services,\nand\n\n316\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.423\nthen you can do the printer redirection\nthe way that you want to there.\n\n317\n00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, and you know,\ngroup policy is really the way to go here,\n\n318\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.670\nthere is a couple specific methods\nthat we really need to focus on,\n\n319\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.585\nwhen we're looking at that from\nthe exam perspective side.\n\n320\n00:19:33.585 --> 00:19:35.430\nRonnie, I don't know if we're\ngonna have enough time to,\n\n321\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.120\nI want to do that in one big chunk,\nso it makes sense to us.\n\n322\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.270\nWe still need to set that up via our\nactive directory group policy, and\n\n323\n00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.380\nthen we also need to take a look at just\na handful of PowerShell commandlets, so\n\n324\n00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.779\nthat we can, you know, deploy, and\nwe talked about this before Powershell,\n\n325\n00:19:52.779 --> 00:19:56.660\njust being used more often and\nmaking things easier for us.\n\n326\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.040\nSo I think that's about it for right now.\n\n327\n00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.830\nBut don't go anywhere,\nbecause we are going to look at those\n\n328\n00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.670\nother two deployment methods for\nenterprise use as well.\n\n329\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.880\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, thank you again for\nat least helping us get to\n\n330\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.920\nthis particular point, and taking a look\nat the idea of configuring printers.\n\n331\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.340\nWe know that this is an important element\nin the life of an MCSA for Window Server\n\n332\n00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.985\n2012, and don't over look it thinking\nthat, it's really not that difficult.\n\n333\n00:20:22.985 --> 00:20:26.040\nIt's not difficult when you\nthink about it logically, but\n\n334\n00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.250\nall the little minor pieces once again\nis where you're gonna be tested on.\n\n335\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.390\nSo make sure you go in there and\n\n336\n00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.610\nyou explore these options,\nif you don't have familiarity with them.\n\n337\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.280\nIf you do, it's a little bit\nmore of a comforting topic.\n\n338\n00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.100\nBut remember some of the tricky things,\nlike the the idea of the priority number.\n\n339\n00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.670\nMe, a one sounds like a higher priority\nthan a 99, but remember what Cherokee\n\n340\n00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.710\nsaid, it's not gonna be that way,\nwhen it goes down to the idea of printing.\n\n341\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.630\nPay attention to those\npermissions as well.\n\n342\n00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.170\nThat can also kind of\ntrip you up a little bit.\n\n343\n00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.680\nMake sure you understand how those work,\nand the idea that you might\n\n344\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.320\nbe able to manage somebody else's\ndocuments, but not your own.\n\n345\n00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.770\nThere's a lot more that's actually right\nthere, and we're going to have that,\n\n346\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:08.400\nof course, coming up in a part three,\nbut that is for the next episode.\n\n347\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.543\nSo singing off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n348\n00:21:12.543 --> 00:21:13.526\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boost.\n\n349\n00:21:13.526

00:00:11.078\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:14.520\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.860\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n6\n00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.620\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we're\nfocusing in on of course Exam 70-410 and\n\n7\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.790\nwe're in a Part 3 on Configuring Printers.\n\n8\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.730\nAnd here to help us understand more about\nthis, is gonna be Miss Cherokee Boost.\n\n9\n00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.020\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.340\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.000\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine.\n\n13\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.500\nNow, Cherokee, we've talked\na lot about the idea, of course,\n\n14\n00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.700\nof configuring printers and\nhow important it is.\n\n15\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.010\nSo what do we really have left to discover\nor to learn about here in our part three?\n\n16\n00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.040\n&gt;&gt; Sure, Ronnie, we did say\nthere were a couple things left.\n\n17\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.368\nSo specifically, Microsoft wants us to\nknow how to do a couple more things as far\n\n18\n00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:53.929\nas enterprise deployment.\n\n19\n00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.700\nThere are additional features that\nwe're not gonna cover here, but\n\n20\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.833\nin real life-land they're really useful.\n\n21\n00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.385\nSuch as utilizing that\nclient side targeting,\n\n22\n00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:07.973\nand even setting up location features,\nwhich is pretty popular.\n\n23\n00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:11.948\nBecause it helps choose the correct\nprinter for whenever a user\n\n24\n00:01:11.948 --> 00:01:16.080\nmay be traveling to different sites,\nand things of that nature.\n\n25\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.730\nSo, just know that this is not\nall-encompassing out in the real world,\n\n26\n00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.200\nbut we are sticking true\nto those objectives here.\n\n27\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.780\nSo something I wanna take a look at is, I\nknow we were kind of razzing you, Ronnie,\n\n28\n00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.440\nabout using the color printer.\n\n29\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.980\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n30\n00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.510\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n31\n00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n32\n00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.651\n&gt;&gt; But in real life, that may be\na scenario that we need to set up for\n\n33\n00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:36.403\nsomeone.\n\n34\n00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:38.867\nSo let's take a look at one\nway that we could do that.\n\n35\n00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:42.534\nAll right, so from Server Manager,\nlet's go under Tools and\n\n36\n00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:44.870\nopen up our Print Management Console.\n\n37\n00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:51.812\nNow, I already have some printers\nthat are listed here, but\n\n38\n00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.023\nI'd like to create a new one.\n\n39\n00:01:53.023 --> 00:01:56.920\nWe haven't really done that from our\nprint management console interface.\n\n40\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.004\nSo let's take a look at how we would\ngo ahead and create a new printer.\n\n41\n00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.736\nIt's relatively easy, we just right-click\non top of our printer over here.\n\n42\n00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:08.496\nUnderneath of our print server, PLABDC01.\n\n43\n00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:12.764\nSo if I was managing multiple servers,\nthen you would need to expand that out\n\n44\n00:02:12.764 --> 00:02:16.314\nto make sure you're adding\nthe printer on the correct server.\n\n45\n00:02:16.314 --> 00:02:18.716\nI only have one right here, so\nlet's just select Add Printer.\n\n46\n00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:22.440\nAnd we'll create another local port here.\n\n47\n00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.460\nI think I'm up to port5 for\nthat demo false port.\n\n48\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.252\nNo, port 6.\n\n49\n00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:32.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know I've been a little crazy\n\n50\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.410\nwith my printers here.\n\n51\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.630\nAll right, port 6 will work for us.\n\n52\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.450\nWe'll hit OK.\n\n53\n00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:44.260\nAnd you know what?\n\n54\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.750\nLet me go with the Canon this time,\nbecause Ronnie had to give me some issues\n\n55\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.550\nwith, and I'm gonna pick\nthe M-Class because you know what?\n\n56\n00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.130\nI actually do have an M-Class Canon and\nit is nice, so if I can find it.\n\n57\n00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.740\nOkay, maybe for sake of,\nthere we go, here's one.\n\n58\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.010\nAll right, let's just choose one and\nwe'll hit Next.\n\n59\n00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.220\nAll right, we'll name this the manager.\n\n60\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.560\nSince this is a nice printer,\nwe're gonna reserve this for the managers.\n\n61\n00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.072\nWe don't want Ronnie printing to this.\n\n62\n00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.082\n&gt;&gt; That's now how you spell manager,\nbut it's a manger.\n\n63\n00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:20.258\n&gt;&gt; Okay, mangers.\n\n64\n00:03:20.258 --> 00:03:22.512\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a little bit different.\n\n65\n00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:28.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, managers.\n\n66\n00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.230\nWhat would I do without you, Ronnie?\n\n67\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.150\nLet's hit Next here, good to go.\n\n68\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.680\nAnd we'll Finish, okay.\n\n69\n00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.700\nNow, remember the way that it's\ncurrently configured that default,\n\n70\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.398\nsecurity principles,\nthat everyone can print.\n\n71\n00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:51.420\nSo we need to set some restrictions\nhere via with our permissions.\n\n72\n00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.066\nBut what if I wanted to make it\nreally simple for those managers?\n\n73\n00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:58.330\nBecause managers like to have\nthings work well for them.\n\n74\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.245\nSo when they log into their systems,\nthey don't wanna add a new printer and\n\n75\n00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:03.062\nconnect to it.\n\n76\n00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:06.500\nSo, what can I do to help facilitate that?\n\n77\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.730\nWell, we can utilize group policy\nto go ahead and push that out.\n\n78\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.028\nSo, let's just minimize our print\nmanagement console for a moment, and\n\n79\n00:04:15.028 --> 00:04:16.010\nthen launch up.\n\n80\n00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.028\nA couple way you could do this,\nyou can utilize your tools if we were.\n\n81\n00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:26.490\nIn a different environment, you can also\njust run group policy management console\n\n82\n00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.030\ndown here with the run line.\n\n83\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.770\nBut for right now, we'll just select\nthrough the graphical user interface.\n\n84\n00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.038\nOkay, so from within\nGroup Policy Management Editor,\n\n85\n00:04:36.038 --> 00:04:39.769\nI've already created an organizational\nunit called Managers.\n\n86\n00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:42.094\nIf you're not familiar\nwith Active Directory and\n\n87\n00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:44.427\nthe structure that's behind that,\nno worries.\n\n88\n00:04:44.427 --> 00:04:50.020\nWe're gonna have shows that explain\nActive Directory and group policy.\n\n89\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.130\nBut just think of this particular\norganizational unit as a container or\n\n90\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.390\na bucket.\n\n91\n00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.372\nAnd inside of this Managers group, I could\nmy managers for easy administration.\n\n92\n00:05:00.372 --> 00:05:04.198\nAnd then I could push these policies out\nto them without having to go to each\n\n93\n00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:05.567\nindividual user to do so.\n\n94\n00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:09.559\nSo, something else, that printer,\n\n95\n00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:16.433\nwe need to make sure that it's\nlisted in Active Directory there.\n\n96\n00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:21.620\nAnd whenever I create a group policy\nobject, I need to bind it to something.\n\n97\n00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.673\nSo my computers and, or\n\n98\n00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:28.820\nusers in this group are gonna\nget that GPO setting applied.\n\n99\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.581\nSo what I'm gonna do is just right-click\non that top of that manager's OU.\n\n100\n00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:38.915\nAnd select, Create a GPO in\nthis domain and link it here.\n\n101\n00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:41.363\nAlternatively, you could create a GPO and\n\n102\n00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:44.088\nthen later apply it to\nan organizational unit.\n\n103\n00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:47.881\nBut by right-clicking on top of it, and\njust doing it all in one fell swoop,\n\n104\n00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.805\nI think that is what we wanna do here,\nmake it pretty easy.\n\n105\n00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:56.733\nAnd this is where you would select a link\nand an existing GPO if you wanted to.\n\n106\n00:05:56.733 --> 00:05:59.265\nAll right, for our group policy name,\n\n107\n00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:03.970\nremember we are restricting this\nparticular printer to managers only.\n\n108\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.110\nSo let's go ahead and select,\n\n109\n00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.690\nmaybe we'll say ManagerPrinterSetup.\n\n110\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.700\nSomething like that,\nbecause what we're trying to do, again,\n\n111\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.900\njust making this really easy for\nthat manager.\n\n112\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.839\nThey don't need to manually go out and\ninstall that printer.\n\n113\n00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:26.940\nI'm doing the work behind the scenes,\npushing it out onto their client systems.\n\n114\n00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.516\nNow let's hit OK.\n\n115\n00:06:28.516 --> 00:06:33.458\nI'm not gonna use any kind of template GPO\nfor the moment, creating our own here.\n\n116\n00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:37.239\nAnd let's go ahead and\njust minimize that and\n\n117\n00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:41.430\nhop back on over to our\nprint management console.\n\n118\n00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.850\nSo that we can do what we need to do for\nour,\n\n119\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.490\nif I can find the right location here,\nfor our particular printer.\n\n120\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.520\nRemember that manager's\nprinter that we have created.\n\n121\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.048\nSo, what we need to do here,\nis right click,\n\n122\n00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:57.323\nand then we're going to select\nDeploy with Group Policy.\n\n123\n00:06:57.323 --> 00:07:03.293\nAll right, now for our GPO name,\nlet's go ahead and browse and\n\n124\n00:07:03.293 --> 00:07:09.503\nreference back to that GPO that we\njust created a few seconds ago.\n\n125\n00:07:09.503 --> 00:07:11.836\nSo this is gonna be under Managers, and\n\n126\n00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:15.850\nthis was the ManagerPrinterSetup\nthat we had created.\n\n127\n00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.830\nSo let's select OK.\n\n128\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.200\nNow in this section,\nremember I said that we can apply this\n\n129\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.330\nGPO to computers and, or users.\n\n130\n00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.490\nSo for this particular instance,\nlet's just go ahead and\n\n131\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.200\napply on a per-user basis.\n\n132\n00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.820\nBecause I've already added\na manager into our Managers group.\n\n133\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.740\nBut if you had a computer that was\nbeing shared for shared login and\n\n134\n00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.680\nyou wanted that link there\nto that particular computer,\n\n135\n00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.050\nyou might wanna choose to go ahead and\ndo both or just the computer.\n\n136\n00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:56.870\nCompletely up to you, but for right now,\nso we see that we had selected Add.\n\n137\n00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.828\nIt is in this bottom section right here.\n\n138\n00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:01.061\nLet's see.\n\n139\n00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:06.500\nJust to make sure, okay, yep,\nI got a little click-happy there.\n\n140\n00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.320\nLet me just hit Remove.\n\n141\n00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.210\nI wanted to make sure\nthat it had went through.\n\n142\n00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:18.690\nBut it had, it was sitting there anyway,\nso let's hit OK, and let me zoom out here.\n\n143\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:24.360\nNow what we wanna do is verify that\nour work has actually completed.\n\n144\n00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.940\nWhenever you create a group policy,\n\n145\n00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.770\nbehind the scenes it may\ntake a little bit of time.\n\n146\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.461\nSo you may suggest to the user to log out,\nlog back in,\n\n147\n00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:36.345\ndepending on that configuration setup.\n\n148\n00:08:36.345 --> 00:08:41.675\nThere are some tools,\ntricks that you can do by either\n\n149\n00:08:41.675 --> 00:08:46.680\nusing GPupdate/ force\nwithin the commandline.\n\n150\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.684\nOr if I go back here into\nmy group policy management,\n\n151\n00:08:51.684 --> 00:08:54.771\nand I can't pull up my task bar.\n\n152\n00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:55.835\nIt's a little difficult here.\n\n153\n00:08:55.835 --> 00:09:00.174\nI have a couple of machines going, so\nI just didn't wanna make it confusing for\n\n154\n00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:00.847\nyou there.\n\n155\n00:09:00.847 --> 00:09:03.685\nBut if I right-click on top of that OU,\n\n156\n00:09:03.685 --> 00:09:10.170\nI can also select Group Policy Update to\nhelp push that setting out to my client.\n\n157\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.010\nAnd we can also check on\nmy client side as well.\n\n158\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.148\nBut that's what we need to do next.\n\n159\n00:09:14.148 --> 00:09:18.402\nLet's go ahead and check on that client\nto see if they actually got that printer\n\n160\n00:09:18.402 --> 00:09:22.156\ninstalled on their system, so\nwe don't have to do it individually.\n\n161\n00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:25.197\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nnow what's Cherokee is referring to there\n\n162\n00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:28.578\nis that group policy does take\na little bit of time to deploy.\n\n163\n00:09:28.578 --> 00:09:31.667\nSo by its nature,\nit's normally about 90 minutes.\n\n164\n00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:38.500\nSo you can tell somebody, go to lunch,\ncome back, and it should take place or so.\n\n165\n00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.690\nOr you can use some of those utilities\nthat Cherokee was talking about to try and\n\n166\n00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.300\nimmediately force it.\n\n167\n00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.950\nSo in that particular setting,\n\n168\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.350\nyou'll actually learn more about that\nwhen Cherokee gets to group policy.\n\n169\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.370\nBut at least at this point, that's why\nwhat we're doing what we're doing here.\n\n170\n00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.581\nCherokee is not going to wait the [LAUGH]\n90 minutes, so she's actually going to end\n\n171\n00:09:56.581 --> 00:10:00.631\nup seeing here how we can make this apply,\nhopefully, just about immediately.\n\n172\n00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:05.611\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so here we have some examples of\ndifferent syntax that can be used before,\n\n173\n00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:06.279\nlet me go.\n\n174\n00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:09.552\nI'm scrolling down all the way at\nthe bottom here so we can see.\n\n175\n00:10:09.552 --> 00:10:12.330\nThey've had a list here for\nrelated links, and\n\n176\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.650\nyou can look at some of\nthe most commonly used ones.\n\n177\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.040\nAnd I'm pulling a couple from here that\nwe'll take a look at within PowerShell.\n\n178\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.078\nSo, let me just go ahead and\nswitch back on over to our machine here,\n\n179\n00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:25.400\nour lab machine.\n\n180\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.036\nAnd we'll just use a very simple\nget-printer to see what kind of printers\n\n181\n00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:31.773\nare on this local machine.\n\n182\n00:10:31.773 --> 00:10:37.087\nAnd these are all the printers that we\nhave created thus far in our shows here.\n\n183\n00:10:37.087 --> 00:10:41.400\nBut what if we wanted to take a look\nat printers listed for another machine?\n\n184\n00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.714\nSo, let's go ahead and\nuse that same command, but\n\n185\n00:10:44.714 --> 00:10:48.194\nthen we'll also specify\na different computer here.\n\n186\n00:10:48.194 --> 00:10:51.228\nSo here let's go ahead and\ngive a space dash, and\n\n187\n00:10:51.228 --> 00:10:53.673\nthen we'll type in the computer name.\n\n188\n00:10:53.673 --> 00:11:00.600\nSo I'll say plabdm01, and we'll hit Enter.\n\n189\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.704\nNow this one's kind of funny.\n\n190\n00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:05.488\nLike I said, due to the nature of\nthe way that this lab is configured,\n\n191\n00:11:05.488 --> 00:11:07.850\nI'm actually remoted in from that DMO 1.\n\n192\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:14.320\nSo you can see printer 1, 2 and\n3 listed natively on DMO 1.\n\n193\n00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.980\nAnd you can see how that easy\nprint driver is actually being\n\n194\n00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.560\nutilized here from the DCO1,\nit being directed.\n\n195\n00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.430\nSo those are just a couple\nthings you could do,\n\n196\n00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.455\nchecking out the different printers\nthat are currently installed.\n\n197\n00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:29.995\nBut what if you wanted to go ahead and\n\n198\n00:11:29.995 --> 00:11:33.155\ngenerate a printer right here\nfrom the command prompt?\n\n199\n00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:34.275\nWell, we can do that too.\n\n200\n00:11:34.275 --> 00:11:35.234\nOf course, we can.\n\n201\n00:11:35.234 --> 00:11:38.339\nThere are actually a lot of different\ntypes of parameters that you can add.\n\n202\n00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:43.254\nAnd you can add, especially if you're\nusing any kind of advanced features\n\n203\n00:11:43.254 --> 00:11:47.165\nlike any kind of branch printing and\nthings of that nature.\n\n204\n00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.295\nBut let's just go ahead and\nclear our screen out.\n\n205\n00:11:50.948 --> 00:11:54.045\nAnd the commandlet that we're\ngonna be using here is going to be\n\n206\n00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:59.260\nadd-printer and\nlet's specify the printer name.\n\n207\n00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.990\nSo here, we'll type in name and\nlet's go ahead and name this one, Ronnie.\n\n208\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.197\nRonnie gets his own printer so\n\n209\n00:12:07.197 --> 00:12:12.948\nthat he can print all the color pages he\nwant as long, as he buys the ink for it.\n\n210\n00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:16.090\nWe also need to specify the driver names.\n\n211\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.057\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntype in driver name.\n\n212\n00:12:20.057 --> 00:12:23.970\nAnd because we're just\nsetting up a fake printer,\n\n213\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:29.166\nhere let's just type in the Microsoft\nto the virtual print driver.\n\n214\n00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:33.616\nMicrosoft, this is going to be the XPS.\n\n215\n00:12:33.616 --> 00:12:36.010\nThis is our virtual\nprinter document writer.\n\n216\n00:12:39.373 --> 00:12:41.540\nWhat, we don't give you a real printer?\n\n217\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n218\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, version four,\nand let's end quote that.\n\n219\n00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.704\nAnd then what else do we need?\n\n220\n00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:51.750\nWe need to create a port name.\n\n221\n00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:56.295\nAnd the port name that we're\ngonna be using here with Ronnie's\n\n222\n00:12:56.295 --> 00:12:59.475\nvirtual printer is going\nto be port prompt.\n\n223\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:07.874\nAnd remember the port prompt port is\njust going to be that particular port\n\n224\n00:13:07.874 --> 00:13:13.256\nto prompt that file explorer window,\nwhere you could do almost a Save As.\n\n225\n00:13:13.256 --> 00:13:15.042\nAnd so that's what we're doing here for\nthis demo.\n\n226\n00:13:15.042 --> 00:13:18.012\nBut if you were adding a real printer,\nyou would add the real driver.\n\n227\n00:13:18.012 --> 00:13:22.719\nAnd then also the real port that\nyou would be using to connect that.\n\n228\n00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:23.970\nSo, here we go.\n\n229\n00:13:25.128 --> 00:13:27.741\nLet me just make sure I\nspecified that correctly.\n\n230\n00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:30.676\nThis is going to be my port prompt.\n\n231\n00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:36.892\nLet's see, P-O-R-T P-R-O-M-P-T.\n\n232\n00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.770\nThat would help if you\nspelled it correctly.\n\n233\n00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:46.529\nLet me go back change that, O-M-P-T.\n\n234\n00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:50.328\nAll right, so\nnow that printer has been created.\n\n235\n00:13:50.328 --> 00:13:55.828\nWe could even do a get-printer\nhere to verify that that printer,\n\n236\n00:13:55.828 --> 00:13:59.030\noops, and that's not right either.\n\n237\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.254\nLet me do get-printer.\n\n238\n00:14:03.254 --> 00:14:07.912\nAll right, and\nyou can see Ronnie's printer listed right\n\n239\n00:14:07.912 --> 00:14:11.819\nhere at the top of the list,\nzoom in, all right?\n\n240\n00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:15.820\nAnd all that information that\nwe just added, it's not shared.\n\n241\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.516\nYou could also add different parameters to\ngo ahead and share that and to publish it,\n\n242\n00:14:20.516 --> 00:14:22.180\nlist it in Active Directory.\n\n243\n00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.010\nBut we're just gonna keep\nit very simple for now.\n\n244\n00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.780\nAnother thing you may want to do,\nand let me clear this off here,\n\n245\n00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.400\nis maybe you wanna change or\nrename that particular printer.\n\n246\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:39.140\nSo maybe Ronnie got demoted from\nhis printer privileges there,\n\n247\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.770\nand maybe I was given the printer.\n\n248\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.444\n&gt;&gt; Of course,\nyou should be given the same printer.\n\n249\n00:14:43.444 --> 00:14:44.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The same printer.\n\n250\n00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.000\n&gt;&gt; The exact same.\n\n251\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.130\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so let's take your printer and\ngive it to Cherokee.\n\n252\n00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.590\nSo how would we do that administratively?\n\n253\n00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.535\nLet's take a look.\n\n254\n00:14:52.535 --> 00:14:57.960\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just\nset my little parameter alias.\n\n255\n00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.432\nI'm gonna type in $printer, and\n\n256\n00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:06.468\nthen we'll say that that\nequals a get-printer.\n\n257\n00:15:06.468 --> 00:15:10.114\nAnd here we'll specify the name, so\n\n258\n00:15:10.114 --> 00:15:14.239\nthe current name was Ronnie, all right?\n\n259\n00:15:14.239 --> 00:15:17.280\nAnd so we'll just hit Enter.\n\n260\n00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.296\nSo now when I call upon that for\nthis particular syntax here,\n\n261\n00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:22.885\nlet's type in rename.\n\n262\n00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:27.029\nAnd then we'll hit -printer and\n\n263\n00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:32.210\nthat is going to be space -input object.\n\n264\n00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.740\nAnd that's going to be $printer because\nI'm specifying what we just created.\n\n265\n00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.579\nAnd then I have to add the new name,\nso this is going to be Cherokee.\n\n266\n00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:46.540\nAnd that should work now.\n\n267\n00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.596\nIf we do another get-printer,\n\n268\n00:15:49.596 --> 00:15:55.603\nwe'll see that that printer has\nnow been renamed to Cherokee.\n\n269\n00:15:55.603 --> 00:15:58.707\nSo, as you can see, it's pretty easy.\n\n270\n00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:02.516\nJust getting familiar with the syntax is\ngoing to be the main thing here within\n\n271\n00:16:02.516 --> 00:16:03.640\nPowerShell.\n\n272\n00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.246\nA lot of different ways you can set up\nprinting in an enterprise environment.\n\n273\n00:16:07.246 --> 00:16:09.994\nSo, I guess my best advice would\nbe just to get in there and\n\n274\n00:16:09.994 --> 00:16:13.739\npractice around with it, because it's\nnot really something you can avoid.\n\n275\n00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:15.224\nAlthough you may try to,\n\n276\n00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:18.850\nI dont know if you'll have much\nsuccess with avoiding that.\n\n277\n00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.160\nSo, I think that's about it for\nthis show, Ronnie.\n\n278\n00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.804\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, well, thank\nyou again for helping us out here and\n\n279\n00:16:25.804 --> 00:16:29.887\ncompleting our basic knowledge for\nthe 70-410 on configuring printers.\n\n280\n00:16:29.887 --> 00:16:33.425\nRemember that we did take a look at\nthe idea of using group policy to deploy\n\n281\n00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:34.590\nthe printer.\n\n282\n00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.194\nAnd Cherokee showed us, of course,\nhow to get that set up and\n\n283\n00:16:37.194 --> 00:16:38.277\nverify that it did work.\n\n284\n00:16:38.277 --> 00:16:42.537\nAs well as learning about some of these\ndifferent PowerShell commands that will\n\n285\n00:16:42.537 --> 00:16:46.620\nreally help us out as well when we do need\nto deploy a lot of things at one time.\n\n286\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.553\nAnd be able to verify that those\nprinters are where they need to be,\n\n287\n00:16:50.553 --> 00:16:52.680\nas well as renaming them.\n\n288\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.190\nAll right, well,\nthat's gonna end our show for now.\n\n289\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.680\nThere is more to come.\n\n290\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.390\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n291\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n292\n00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:09.300\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned

00:00:12.518\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:15.652\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:19.071\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n6\n00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:22.854\nWe're specifically covering,\nof course, exam 70-410, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:24.860\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.540\nToday, we're gonna be diving into\nconfiguring servers for remote management.\n\n9\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.380\nAnd here to help us understand it\nbetter is gonna be Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.710\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.090\nHow are you doing today?\n\n13\n00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.110\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fine.\n\n14\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.660\nAs we get started here, Cherokee, we have\nto ask that kind of big question, why do\n\n15\n00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.910\nwe need to configure for remote management\nif I can gain access to the servers?\n\n16\n00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually that's a pretty\ninvalid question, Ronnie.\n\n17\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.930\nAnd it's not like it's new.\n\n18\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.280\nWe've had remote desktop protocol,\nRDP, around for a while.\n\n19\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.567\nSo why wouldn't we just use\nRDP to go ahead and remote,\n\n20\n00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:57.628\nif I wanted to remote in?\n\n21\n00:00:57.628 --> 00:01:01.269\nBecause we all know that sitting\nin my chair and being relaxed and\n\n22\n00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.870\ncomfortable there is a lot easier than\ngoing to an offsite location or whatever.\n\n23\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.600\nSo let's just think about that for\na second.\n\n24\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.930\nIf I'm connecting to your system remotely,\nutilizing RDP, I still have access.\n\n25\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.196\nWhen I have that session established,\nI have all those graphical components and\n\n26\n00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:18.830\nelements.\n\n27\n00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.452\nBut I just am viewing them through like\na little magic looking glass here,\n\n28\n00:01:23.452 --> 00:01:27.940\nbut all that work, all that load is\nstill happening on your PC, right?\n\n29\n00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.778\nSo we're running all those\ngraphical components and\n\n30\n00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:32.930\nall that additional processing power.\n\n31\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.523\nAnd Microsoft came up with\na better way to do that.\n\n32\n00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:41.495\nSo we're gonna be looking at different\nways that we can leverage something\n\n33\n00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:45.295\nhere called WinRM for\nWindows Remote Management.\n\n34\n00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:50.200\nAnd it's kind of interesting, if we take a\nlook at my screen, the way that WinRM was\n\n35\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.791\ndeveloped, it actually piggybacks\noff of a protocol here.\n\n36\n00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:56.858\nSo let me scroll right here.\n\n37\n00:01:56.858 --> 00:02:00.823\nThe DWS management protocol was\ndeveloped by group of hardware and\n\n38\n00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:05.002\nsoftware manufacturers as a public\nstandard for remotely exchanging\n\n39\n00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:10.130\nmanagement data without any computer\ndevice that implements the protocol.\n\n40\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.730\nSo here's the thing.\n\n41\n00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.980\nIt never really took off as\nlarge as they thought it would.\n\n42\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.192\nThere are about four large realms that\nare utilizing this WS management protocol,\n\n43\n00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:21.760\none of them being WinRM.\n\n44\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.480\nSo that's what we'll start talking\nabout here in this show today.\n\n45\n00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.240\nSo WinRM is gonna be\nprocessing those requests for\n\n46\n00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.540\nremote management over your network.\n\n47\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.270\nAnd it's using http and https, but not the\nnormal ports that you would expect it to.\n\n48\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.939\nSo when we're looking at the ports here\nwe're talking about port 5985 and 5986.\n\n49\n00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.151\nAnd thinking about, okay,\n\n50\n00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:51.180\nwhat do I have to do to remember\nall these ports to set this up.\n\n51\n00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.770\nSetting those exclusions\non our firewall list.\n\n52\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.920\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n53\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.880\nMicrosoft really wanted to\nstreamline this process for us, so\n\n54\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.150\nthey've also developed some tools\nthat are pretty handy to help.\n\n55\n00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.810\nLike I said,\nstreamline that process for us.\n\n56\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.070\nSo instead of going through and creating\nall of our different components and\n\n57\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.620\nprerequisites, it's like\na little checklist,\n\n58\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.060\nsuch as some things that I wanna do.\n\n59\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.290\nNumber one, okay, so\nI do need to check those firewalls.\n\n60\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.176\nBut, hey, Microsoft's got some tools,\nI'll show you how we can do that.\n\n61\n00:03:21.176 --> 00:03:27.321\nAlso, talking about receiving those\nremote communications over the network,\n\n62\n00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:32.484\nwe need a way to hear and listen for\nthose session requests, right?\n\n63\n00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:33.920\nSo we need listeners.\n\n64\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.940\nSo that's not something that\nwe have to configure manually\n\n65\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.870\nwith the use of these tools,\nso it's pretty cool.\n\n66\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.650\nWe have a couple different ways\nthat we can actually access them\n\n67\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.410\nby using Windows Remote Management.\n\n68\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.030\nWindows Remote Management is\nactually a service, Ronnie.\n\n69\n00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.160\nAnd we can take a look at\nthat in a few moments,\n\n70\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.820\nright within services.msc, just to make\nsure that it's running, of course.\n\n71\n00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.410\nWe can't utilize it if it's not running.\n\n72\n00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.176\nSo by default, in Server 2012 and\n2012 R2, it is enabled by default.\n\n73\n00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:06.862\nAlso, server 2016.\n\n74\n00:04:06.862 --> 00:04:12.130\nWe'll also talk about different ways\nthat we can manage down-level servers.\n\n75\n00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.517\nIf you think about it,\n\n76\n00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:19.284\nnot every single network in this world is\nonly using 2012 2012 R2 and above, right?\n\n77\n00:04:19.284 --> 00:04:22.363\nSo there's a little bit of\nconfiguration you do there.\n\n78\n00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:26.410\nBut it sure is an improvement over\nsome of those older methodology,\n\n79\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.823\nespecially with a DCOM which\nwas not firewall friendly.\n\n80\n00:04:29.823 --> 00:04:32.270\nSo that's what we'll be\ntalking about today.\n\n81\n00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.559\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so\n\n82\n00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:37.146\nwhat are we really accessing when we\nuse this idea of remote management?\n\n83\n00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:39.028\nWhat protocol or\nwhat is it that we're doing here?\n\n84\n00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:41.730\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're actually gonna be hooking into WMI,\n\n85\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.581\nwhich is\nWindows Management Instrumentation.\n\n86\n00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:47.162\nSo that's what we'll be hooking into.\n\n87\n00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.420\nThere are a couple different ways.\n\n88\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.050\nActually, if we take a look at my screen,\n\n89\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.250\nI can pull up a diagram I've got here,\njust to kinda cover.\n\n90\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.920\nAnd we'll look at each one of these\nin depth, these methodologies here.\n\n91\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.860\nBut there are different ways that\nwe can hook into WMI here, so\n\n92\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.030\nnumber one being the GUI, right?\n\n93\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.539\nSo if you watch some of the other shows,\nand\n\n94\n00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.004\nwe've kind of got into the server manager,\nyou've already seen that we can\n\n95\n00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:14.315\nmanage servers remotely from\nwithin server managers.\n\n96\n00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:18.239\nSo that's one way that we\ncould do that using WinRM.\n\n97\n00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:21.925\nYou can also use some other\ngraphical components as well,\n\n98\n00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:27.290\nlike those management tools, when we were\ndiscussing different roles and features.\n\n99\n00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.213\nIf I have the Microsoft Management\nConsole, so my MMC and my snap-ins,\n\n100\n00:05:32.213 --> 00:05:37.237\nthat's a graphical element that I'm\njust gonna bundle in this GUI here.\n\n101\n00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:41.184\nBecause the underpinning technology,\nwe're still using WinRM and\n\n102\n00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:44.260\nhooking into the WMI there,\nso pretty cool.\n\n103\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.040\nAnd we also have the ability to\nuse command line tools to execute\n\n104\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.060\ncommands remotely as well.\n\n105\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.186\nWe'll take a look at those, and we have\nthe ability to use PowerShell as well.\n\n106\n00:05:55.186 --> 00:05:58.210\nOf course,\nPowerShell's gonna be a great way for\n\n107\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.510\nus to also manage multiple\ncomputers at one time here.\n\n108\n00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.400\nSo, just to really simplify\nadministration for remote management.\n\n109\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee, if we wanna get\nthis idea of remote management set up and\n\n110\n00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.210\nconfigured to go, what do we need\nto get started with as we do this?\n\n111\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so first, let's take a look here.\n\n112\n00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.148\nI just wanna show you in a machine here.\n\n113\n00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:22.169\nWhich one can I pull up?\n\n114\n00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.720\nI've got a couple going on.\n\n115\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.890\nYou always wanna make\nsure that it is enabled.\n\n116\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.260\nLike I said, it is enabled by default.\n\n117\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.400\nBut if you're having issues, and we'll get\nto troubleshooting in a little bit and\n\n118\n00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.380\nwhere you can get help for that.\n\n119\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.110\nYou can see right here in the Graphical\nUser Interface Writing Server Manager,\n\n120\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.690\nit says remote management enabled.\n\n121\n00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.073\nSo that's what it would\nlike look like by default.\n\n122\n00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:49.517\nYou could also check here,\nlet me just pull up a run line.\n\n123\n00:06:49.517 --> 00:06:53.119\nOops, gotta login.\n\n124\n00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:53.752\n&gt;&gt; You're not typing.\n\n125\n00:06:53.752 --> 00:06:58.829\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do that all the time.\n\n126\n00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:01.390\n[LAUGH] All right, [LAUGH] so let me\ngo ahead and pull up my run line here.\n\n127\n00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.068\nSo it's already in here, and\nI'll just zoom in so you can see that.\n\n128\n00:07:05.068 --> 00:07:09.620\nWe've got services.msc, and we'll go\nahead and pull up our services page and\n\n129\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.090\ntake a look at that.\n\n130\n00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.530\nLet's take a full screen,\n\n131\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.830\nand it's going to be all the way\ndown here at the bottom of our list.\n\n132\n00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.350\nAnd let's see, all right, so right here.\n\n133\n00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.779\nWindows Remote Management, so\nWS Management is going to be the service\n\n134\n00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.826\nthat we wanna enable,\nto verify that it's running here.\n\n135\n00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:38.712\nNow, right behind my head there,\nif you look at the actual status,\n\n136\n00:07:38.712 --> 00:07:40.790\nit is set to be automatic.\n\n137\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.061\nWhich is really important because you\nwanna make sure that if that system\n\n138\n00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:50.117\nreboots or whatever, you're still gonna\nhave that service start upon that reboot.\n\n139\n00:07:50.117 --> 00:07:53.613\nBecause obviously the service has to\nbe running in order to utilize that.\n\n140\n00:07:53.613 --> 00:07:58.125\nAnd you can even see WMI here\nas well running as automatic.\n\n141\n00:07:58.125 --> 00:07:59.664\nBecause that's, like I said,\n\n142\n00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:03.717\nthat's what we're gonna be hooking in\nthat Windows Management instrumentation.\n\n143\n00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:09.442\nOf course you could always check\nthe status of a service within PowerShell,\n\n144\n00:08:09.442 --> 00:08:11.330\nbut that's just great.\n\n145\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.950\nBut what if someone were to go ahead and\ndisable that, so\n\n146\n00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.490\nwhat do we do in that situation?\n\n147\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.970\nHow do we bring the system back\nup to that default configuration?\n\n148\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.152\nSo we'll take a look at that also.\n\n149\n00:08:22.152 --> 00:08:25.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so where are we\ngonna end up getting started here?\n\n150\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:33.070\nNow that we've verified that we have the\nremote management enabled there, now that\n\n151\n00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.790\nwe've also talked about the service and we\nsee it started, those are the things that\n\n152\n00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:39.310\nwe have to get ready on the machines\nthat we're gonna do this with.\n\n153\n00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.130\nSo what's next?\n\n154\n00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n155\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.400\nlet's go ahead and take a look at,\nI have a couple different machines here.\n\n156\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.461\nI've got DC01,\nthat's my domain controller.\n\n157\n00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:50.780\nI had DM01, so domain number one and\ndomain number two.\n\n158\n00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.340\nI also have a client over here,\nWindows 10 client, which is really cool.\n\n159\n00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.540\nBecause, Ronnie, if you think about it,\nmaybe I have like a limited budget.\n\n160\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:05.240\nAnd I don't have like\na machine to just dedicate to\n\n161\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.320\nmanagement like a server side with all\nthe hardware, the robustness of that.\n\n162\n00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.068\nSo what if I just have a client operating\nsystem, so I don't have to spend so\n\n163\n00:09:14.068 --> 00:09:15.500\nmuch for licensing.\n\n164\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.550\nI can actually utilize these tools to\nmanage from a client operating system.\n\n165\n00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.090\nSo it's not just network operating\nsystem to network operating system.\n\n166\n00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.790\nThat's another really cool\nfeature that we have here.\n\n167\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.460\nBut we'll get into that in a little bit,\n\n168\n00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.670\nbecause you would need to take a look\nat some configuration as well.\n\n169\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.790\nSo first thing's first,\nlet's go into DM01.\n\n170\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.300\nOkay, so\nPowerShell's already pulled up here.\n\n171\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.097\nOops, again, logon.\n\n172\n00:09:43.097 --> 00:09:45.749\nAnd-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n173\n00:09:45.749 --> 00:09:47.584\nyou have to actually click and type in.\n\n174\n00:09:47.584 --> 00:09:54.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right, you gotta love\nthe controls with my VM here.\n\n175\n00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.420\nOkay, cool, and\nlet me just move this over.\n\n176\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:06.199\nSo the first tool that I wanna take a look\nat here, this is going to be winrm.exe.\n\n177\n00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:10.459\nI would like to note that,\nalthough I do have PowerShell pulled up,\n\n178\n00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:14.610\nyou can utilize winrm.exe in\nan elevated command prompt.\n\n179\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.510\nSo it's not a cmdlet per se,\nit's a command line utility here.\n\n180\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:24.630\nNow there's a quick config option\nthat we'll be taking a look at here.\n\n181\n00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.390\nSo what this quick config\nwill allow us to do\n\n182\n00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:33.310\nis to allow us to utilize another tool for\nWinRS, for remote shell.\n\n183\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.770\nInstead of manually going\nthrough the process and\n\n184\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.360\nimplementing all the different firewall\nrules and setting up a listener,\n\n185\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.650\nthis tool that we're about to look at\nwill automate that process for us.\n\n186\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.310\nSo pretty cool, Ronnie.\n\n187\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.734\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n188\n00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:55.132\nthe first thing I wanna just check.\n\n189\n00:10:55.132 --> 00:10:56.292\nOkay, so we did check,\n\n190\n00:10:56.292 --> 00:11:00.100\nI don't remember if we checked on this\nmachine if it was running or not.\n\n191\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.938\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think we have.\n\n192\n00:11:00.938 --> 00:11:02.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we can just check here.\n\n193\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.270\nSo let's just say check-service.\n\n194\n00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.180\nAnd this is our WinRM service.\n\n195\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:13.069\nOkay, so it stopped here and\nI think we had even before the show, oops,\n\n196\n00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:14.220\ndisabled that.\n\n197\n00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.148\nYep, so this one, we are on DM01.\n\n198\n00:11:16.148 --> 00:11:16.990\nIt is disabled.\n\n199\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.530\nIt's stopped.\n\n200\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.277\nSo let's go ahead and\nsee how we can fix that.\n\n201\n00:11:20.277 --> 00:11:24.830\nAll right, now, I do wanna show you one\nother way you can check on that, also.\n\n202\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.420\nLet's type in WinRM.\n\n203\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:33.922\nThis is going to be get,\nspace, winrm, again, /config.\n\n204\n00:11:33.922 --> 00:11:35.148\nAnd then we'll hit Enter.\n\n205\n00:11:37.303 --> 00:11:41.059\nAll right, so this notification is\nbasically just telling us, hey,\n\n206\n00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:43.360\nit's not configured properly.\n\n207\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.580\nAnd then it even notes the tool that we're\nabout to use to go ahead and set it up.\n\n208\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.220\nSo that's what it's referencing\nhere with WinRM quickconfig.\n\n209\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.960\nSo that's what we'll be using.\n\n210\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.370\nYou can also shorten WinRM quickconfig\nwith just a qc if you wanted to,\n\n211\n00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.710\nbut we'll go ahead and type it all out.\n\n212\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.140\nAll right, there's also help here.\n\n213\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.130\nLet me just clear this screen.\n\n214\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.378\nReally good information for.\n\n215\n00:12:07.378 --> 00:12:11.066\nAll you're gonna have to\ntype here is winrm and\n\n216\n00:12:11.066 --> 00:12:16.184\nthen -?, hit Enter, and\nyou can see all sorts of things here.\n\n217\n00:12:16.184 --> 00:12:22.497\nSo there's even help here with the g-,\nso that's what the reference thing also.\n\n218\n00:12:22.497 --> 00:12:24.850\nYou can also put the G for get.\n\n219\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.869\nYou can kind of shorten it or\nyou could type out get either way.\n\n220\n00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:32.795\nBut it'll expand upon each one of\nthese different components here, so\n\n221\n00:12:32.795 --> 00:12:35.680\nyou can really get information on those.\n\n222\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.052\nThere's even a help here for\n\n223\n00:12:37.052 --> 00:12:41.890\nwinrm quickconfig if you wanted to\nexplore that a little bit more deeply.\n\n224\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.375\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee,\n\n225\n00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:47.886\nas we're about to run this command,\nsince we kind of went in and\n\n226\n00:12:47.886 --> 00:12:51.398\ntyped another command right away here,\ndo I need to go ahead and\n\n227\n00:12:51.398 --> 00:12:56.070\nmake sure that the service right now is\nstarted on this machine before I start?\n\n228\n00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.344\nOr is WinRM quickconfig going\nto start that service for me?\n\n229\n00:13:00.344 --> 00:13:01.688\n&gt;&gt; So, good question, Ronnie.\n\n230\n00:13:01.688 --> 00:13:07.200\nWe want WinRM to go ahead with our\nquickconfig to start this for me.\n\n231\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.620\nBut we can check and verify just like\nalways whenever we're finished here.\n\n232\n00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.312\nSo, all right, let's go ahead and\nget that going here.\n\n233\n00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:23.911\nAnd our command, let's see,\nwe're just gonna go ahead,\n\n234\n00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:28.094\nit's just WinRM quickconfig,\nand like I said,\n\n235\n00:13:28.094 --> 00:13:33.206\nyou could type in QC, or\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] QC, yeah, all right.\n\n236\n00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:35.410\nAll right, so let's just go ahead and\ntype that in.\n\n237\n00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.790\nNow, you're gonna be prompted several\ntimes, because this is an iterative\n\n238\n00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.760\nprocess where it's just saying, hey,\ndo you wanna make these changes?\n\n239\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.580\nSo we are gonna have to interact here.\n\n240\n00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.540\nAll right, we'll go ahead and hit Yes.\n\n241\n00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:51.090\nAnd then it's asking us, hey, WinRM\nhas been updated to receive requests.\n\n242\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.200\nThe WinRM service has started,\nso we can verify that as well.\n\n243\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.830\nThat's not a bad idea.\n\n244\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.080\nWinRM is not setup to allow remote\naccess to the machine for management.\n\n245\n00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.210\nAnd then it says the following changes\nmust be made and then it's just asking,\n\n246\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.380\nhey, do you wanna make these changes,\nyes or no?\n\n247\n00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.260\nSo of course, we'll hit Yes.\n\n248\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.130\nAnd now it's been updated for management.\n\n249\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.659\nSo that's pretty cool, Ronnie.\n\n250\n00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:21.206\nIt's a lot easier than having to go\nahead and settle that up individually.\n\n251\n00:14:21.206 --> 00:14:25.722\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee, now that\nI've got that set up for a quick config,\n\n252\n00:14:25.722 --> 00:14:26.654\nthis allows for\n\n253\n00:14:26.654 --> 00:14:31.549\nremote management of which of the two\nmachines, DC01 or DM01 at this point?\n\n254\n00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:35.132\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nnow that we've just set that up on DM01,\n\n255\n00:14:35.132 --> 00:14:37.682\nthat means I can utilize this on DM01.\n\n256\n00:14:37.682 --> 00:14:41.640\nSo if I wanted to go ahead,\ncuz I'm on this machine right here,\n\n257\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.520\nthat's where we just run it.\n\n258\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.364\nIf I wanted to check the use of that,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n259\n00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:51.480\nlog in to our DM02 and\nlet me just clear this thing here.\n\n260\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.011\nOops, of course,\n\n261\n00:15:04.585 --> 00:15:08.699\nThat's pretty bright, let me go ahead and\nchange the color on this background for\n\n262\n00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:09.481\nus real quick.\n\n263\n00:15:09.481 --> 00:15:13.251\nSo I'm not causing any kind of seizures or\nanything like that.\n\n264\n00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:16.690\nAll right, [LAUGH] I think that's better,\nI don't know.\n\n265\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.786\nBut, yeah, Ronnie,\njust to to clarify here.\n\n266\n00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:23.700\nSo what we've done is we've ran\na quickconfig on DM01 which\n\n267\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.060\nwould now enable us to\naccess DM01 utilizing WinRS.\n\n268\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:34.342\nSo WinRS, remote shell,\nis a command line utility\n\n269\n00:15:34.342 --> 00:15:39.792\nthat I can send and\nexecute those commands remotely.\n\n270\n00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:43.900\nAnd like I said, you could run this\nin just an elevated command prompt.\n\n271\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.810\nIt doesn't have to be here in PowerShell,\nbut\n\n272\n00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.760\nthat's what I'm using just to demonstrate.\n\n273\n00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.740\nSo now that we're in DM02,\n\n274\n00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.870\nI wanna just kind of show you\nwhat it would look like there.\n\n275\n00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.707\nSo if I type in, all right, WinRS.\n\n276\n00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:02.163\nAnd now, this is kind of strange,\nthe syntax might be a little\n\n277\n00:16:02.163 --> 00:16:07.150\nunusual to you We're gonna go ahead and\ntype in a -r and a colon here.\n\n278\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.640\n&gt;&gt; Now, before you press Enter and\n\n279\n00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.950\ndo all that stuff on this command here,\ndo I need to verify whether or\n\n280\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.380\nnot the service is started that\nwe were talking about earlier?\n\n281\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.576\nYou know, anything like that,\nor is this okay that?\n\n282\n00:16:20.576 --> 00:16:25.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we can, it's not like I said, it's\nnot a bad idea to go ahead and do that.\n\n283\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.970\nSo let's go ahead and let's just, so you\nwanna track it on our DMO1 to make sure?\n\n284\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.789\n&gt;&gt; Well no, on DMO2 do I actually need\nto verify if that service is on or not?\n\n285\n00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:38.147\n&gt;&gt; I am pretty sure we can.\n\n286\n00:16:38.147 --> 00:16:42.970\nI think I checked that beforehand,\nit's not a bad idea.\n\n287\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n288\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.890\n&gt;&gt; Give just one second to get my,\nall right.\n\n289\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.010\nLet me just back out of here.\n\n290\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:50.580\nI can.\n\n291\n00:16:56.199 --> 00:17:00.476\nYeah, good, good.\n\n292\n00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:09.533\nSo it's really more important, Ronnie,\nfor me to make sure that its running on\n\n293\n00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:13.663\nthe machine that I also want to remotely\nmanage, because I'm not gonna be able to,\n\n294\n00:17:13.663 --> 00:17:16.672\nif it was in another building or\nanother state or something,\n\n295\n00:17:16.672 --> 00:17:18.560\njust to walk over there and turn it on.\n\n296\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.190\nSo you definitely wanna make\nsure that it is enabled there.\n\n297\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:26.000\nSo we can do that as well real quick here,\nlet me just go ahead.\n\n298\n00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.990\nThat's why I wanted to\nswitch to that DMO1.\n\n299\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.410\nAnd I'll clear this screen out here.\n\n300\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.240\nAnd we'll do that.\n\n301\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:39.980\nSo this is just get dash service and\nthat's the WINRIN that I'm checking here.\n\n302\n00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.190\nWIMRIN, it would help if\nyou spell it correctly.\n\n303\n00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.389\nAlright so,\nwe can see that it's running here, so\n\n304\n00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:58.370\nthat's definitely a plus for us,\nwhenever we're going to execute here,\n\n305\n00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.971\nbut let me hop back over to DMO2 and\nwe'll take a look at that syntax.\n\n306\n00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:03.609\nYou know what?\n\n307\n00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:05.010\nActually, let me pull up the syntax.\n\n308\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:10.407\nI have a link here, Microsoft has\nsome documentation for the WinRS,\n\n309\n00:18:10.407 --> 00:18:15.338\ndifferent ways that you can take\nadvantage of this tool here and\n\n310\n00:18:15.338 --> 00:18:17.870\nlooking at that syntax.\n\n311\n00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.970\nAnd scrolling down, I think it's\neven the exact same they show up for\n\n312\n00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.400\nthe help file right\nwithin PowerShell 2 if,\n\n313\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.250\nor the command prompt if you\nwanted it to utilize that.\n\n314\n00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:32.120\nSo you can see how dash or\nforward slash with that r, with the colon,\n\n315\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.690\nis going to be required before\nwe initiate our function,\n\n316\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.960\nwhatever it is that we\nwanna execute there.\n\n317\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.400\nSo that's what we'll be looking at here.\n\n318\n00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.020\nLet me get back into that DMO2 machine.\n\n319\n00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.640\nAll right, so we're gonna be checking,\ndoing something, like maybe an IP config,\n\n320\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.150\nor whatever it is that you're\ntasked to do for that DMO1.\n\n321\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.800\nSo the command is going to be here,\nlet's see,\n\n322\n00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.990\nthis is just going to be the one that\nI was trying to use for our WinRS.\n\n323\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:09.241\nAnd this is going to be space -R,\n\n324\n00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:12.845\nhold on if I'm typing.\n\n325\n00:19:12.845 --> 00:19:15.880\nYou can do it.\n\n326\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.110\nAlright now, like I said it, it can be the\ndash or the forward slash, this is WinRS,\n\n327\n00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:24.610\nso I'm just going to use the dash,\ndash r with my colon.\n\n328\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.060\nYou need to specify the name of\nthe machine here, so this is,\n\n329\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:32.580\nI'm running this command for\nDM01, all right?\n\n330\n00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.570\nSo let's make sure we've got DM01, and\nwe'll just run the command ipconfig.\n\n331\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.940\n&gt;&gt; Oops, misspelled config, there you go.\n\n332\n00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.290\n&gt;&gt; We'll do a \"/alt\" just so we can see\nall the information to verify, hey,\n\n333\n00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:54.890\nI'm actually getting this information\nfrom DM01, not DM02 here.\n\n334\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.110\nSo you can see, host name DM01.\n\n335\n00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.670\nAnd all the other, the MAC address, and\nthe IP address, and all that, that we\n\n336\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:08.730\nwould normally see, from running just\na regular ipconfig/all on that machine.\n\n337\n00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.660\nSo that's one tool that\nwe have available to us.\n\n338\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.810\nSo you'll have to utilize the quick\nconfig, to go ahead and set that up.\n\n339\n00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.570\nBut it really didn't take that long and\nit wasn't to difficult.\n\n340\n00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.960\nI showed you with TechNet, there's\ndocumentation to help you get through this\n\n341\n00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.503\nprocess if you need it, but\nthat's about it for that tool.\n\n342\n00:20:24.503 --> 00:20:28.348\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, when we start\ntaking a look at this idea, of course,\n\n343\n00:20:28.348 --> 00:20:32.442\nof using something like remote management,\nwe do need to make sure that we take\n\n344\n00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:35.691\na look at those services, and\nverify that they're running.\n\n345\n00:20:35.691 --> 00:20:39.654\nThe ones that Cherokee showed us, as well\nas being able to run that Quick Config\n\n346\n00:20:39.654 --> 00:20:43.035\ntool, to allow us to gain access\nto those machines that we want to.\n\n347\n00:20:43.035 --> 00:20:47.095\nSo Cherokee also, of course, used WinRS\nto show us what else we can do, to gain\n\n348\n00:20:47.095 --> 00:20:51.780\nmore information remotely, without having\nto actually stop that other machine.\n\n349\n00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.596\nNow, there are other tools available,\nbut we're going to be saving that for\n\n350\n00:20:55.596 --> 00:20:58.425\nanother episode, so\nwe're gonna sign off for this one.\n\n351\n00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:01.643\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n352\n00:21:01.643 --> 00:21:02.593\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n353\n00:21:02.593 --> 00:21:06.373\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n354\n00:21:07.657 --> 00:21:14.727\n[MUSIC]\n\n355\n00:21:14.727 --> 00:21:17.067\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.560\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.601\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.040\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.136\nAnd today, we're actually jumping\ninto a part two on a course, well,\n\n9\n00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:27.370\nremote management for servers.\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.850\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.200\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.300\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.250\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well.\n\n15\n00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.050\nNow, Cherokee, we've already talked\nabout just kind of the basics in getting\n\n16\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.240\nthe set up to doing this.\n\n17\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.732\nSo, what are we taking a look at today?\n\n18\n00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:44.007\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if we can take a look at\nmy screen we've already covered one\n\n19\n00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:45.217\nparticular component.\n\n20\n00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:48.222\nAnd we're gonna just keep going\nwith that theme Ronnie and\n\n21\n00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:52.560\ntake a look at different ways that we\ncan utilize Windows Remote Management.\n\n22\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.870\nSo, I have a diagram here.\n\n23\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.940\nWe looked at this little yellow arrow in\nthe last show, when we were using our\n\n24\n00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.740\nWinRM quickconfig to actually set up and\nestablish a WinRS session there.\n\n25\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.952\nSo in this show,\nwe'll take a look at other ways,\n\n26\n00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:12.396\nlike PowerShell to go ahead,\nand execute remotely.\n\n27\n00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:17.240\nAnd then we will also take a look at some\ngraphical user interface options as well,\n\n28\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.724\nsuch as Server Manager.\n\n29\n00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.649\nAnd we'll take a look at\nlike using our MMCs and\n\n30\n00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.110\nsnap-ins, to go ahead and take advantage\nof some of those graphical tools.\n\n31\n00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.160\nNow, of course you could also\nuse group policy to push the,\n\n32\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.490\nto take advantage of the WinRM as well.\n\n33\n00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.180\nBut we're going to be taking an entire\nsection to look at group policies,\n\n34\n00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.120\nso we'll save that.\n\n35\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.900\nJust know that's also a capability here,\nRonnie.\n\n36\n00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.040\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n37\n00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.720\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n38\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.339\nSo if I pull up my machines,\nI think we were working in our\n\n39\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.040\nlittle environment here\nwhen we left off last time.\n\n40\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.184\nWe had just enabled quickconfig on DM01.\n\n41\n00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:57.170\nAnd we tested that by using DM02.\n\n42\n00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.400\nSo let's go back to DM01.\n\n43\n00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.430\nAnd we'll also enable\nsomething called PSRemoting.\n\n44\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.375\nAnd PSRemoting is,\nwhen I use the cmdlet Enable-PSRemoting\n\n45\n00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:13.283\nit will give the ability\nto then use PowerShell.\n\n46\n00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:18.197\nSo like from another machine\nlike we did before where\n\n47\n00:02:18.197 --> 00:02:22.774\nwe use DMO2 to utilize when our,\nexcuse me, for\n\n48\n00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:26.250\nour WinRS, our remote shell there.\n\n49\n00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.783\nI know all these little\nminutiaes with their acronyms.\n\n50\n00:02:28.783 --> 00:02:32.640\nBut we were able to send those,\nwe did an ipconfig.\n\n51\n00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.200\nSo transversely,\n\n52\n00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.080\nwe could also do that utilizing\nPowerShell, which is kind of cool.\n\n53\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.700\nSo let's go ahead and get that set up.\n\n54\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.718\nIt only take a moment here.\n\n55\n00:02:41.718 --> 00:02:48.100\nSo let's just type in enable-ps,\noops, if I'm typing.\n\n56\n00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.280\nI've done that 15 times already,\nall right.\n\n57\n00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.550\nEnable-pssession.\n\n58\n00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.558\nOops, remoting, that's the commandlet\nthat we wanna use, I'm typing.\n\n59\n00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.809\nNow similar to what we saw when we\nwere setting up the quickconfig,\n\n60\n00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.516\nwe're gonna be prompted\nthrough some steps here.\n\n61\n00:03:11.516 --> 00:03:17.502\nAnd I can kind of condense it\nby utilizing my for yes to all.\n\n62\n00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:20.710\nBut it's still gonna ask me\na few different questions here.\n\n63\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.220\nSo it's saying hey, all right.\n\n64\n00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.470\nWe're set up to go ahead and\nreceive requests on this computer.\n\n65\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.170\nAnd then it's asking me, are you\nsure you wanna perform this action?\n\n66\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.376\nAgain, we'll just do an A for yes to all\nto go ahead and get that enabled for us.\n\n67\n00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:38.780\nAll right, so we're good to go now.\n\n68\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.570\nNo bleeding glaring red messages.\n\n69\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.310\nLet me just clear this screen.\n\n70\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.895\nAnd then let's hop on over to DM02.\n\n71\n00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:50.425\nAll right,\nRonnie what I was thinking of, Nslookup.\n\n72\n00:03:50.425 --> 00:03:53.155\nYou know how you have the interactive and\nthe non-interactive mode?\n\n73\n00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:56.985\nSo that's kind of in my mind what I\nthink about with this invoke command.\n\n74\n00:03:56.985 --> 00:03:59.047\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n75\n00:03:59.047 --> 00:04:01.658\nWhen I go ahead and use this I'm gonna go\nahead and use this I'm actually going to.\n\n76\n00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:05.192\nLet's test something on my domain\ncontroller because I've already done\n\n77\n00:04:05.192 --> 00:04:07.705\nthe prerequisites on my\ndomain controller as well.\n\n78\n00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.095\nSo we've got that rolling.\n\n79\n00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:11.840\nSo I'm gonna type in invoke.\n\n80\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.825\nThis is going to be -command and\nspecify the computer name.\n\n81\n00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.650\nThis is going to be DC01.\n\n82\n00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:28.195\nAnd from here,\nI'm going to use my curly brackets.\n\n83\n00:04:28.195 --> 00:04:31.355\nAnd everything that's inside my curly\nbrackets here is like what I would be\n\n84\n00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:33.615\ntyping my commandlet for that.\n\n85\n00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:37.235\nSo I'm gonna type in get-service.\n\n86\n00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:41.305\nWe'll just check on, I have DNS\nrunning on my domain controller.\n\n87\n00:04:41.305 --> 00:04:42.445\nSo that's what we'll check here.\n\n88\n00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:45.889\nSo we'll say get-service,\nspecify the name of that service, oops.\n\n89\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.180\n-name and we'll say dns.\n\n90\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.310\nAnd of course we have to end our curly\nbrackets to end our thought there.\n\n91\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.572\nAnd then we'll hit Enter.\n\n92\n00:04:58.572 --> 00:05:03.378\nNow when I get my result I can\nsee that this information is\n\n93\n00:05:03.378 --> 00:05:06.890\nactually coming from DCO1.\n\n94\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.230\nAlthough, I'm still\nphysically on DM02 here.\n\n95\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.180\nSo I can see that my DNS service is\nrunning on my domain controller.\n\n96\n00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.290\nSo I've just sent that one command.\n\n97\n00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.120\nI haven't established any connection.\n\n98\n00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.880\nI just had that one query, got my result.\n\n99\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.970\nThat's it for the invoke command, right?\n\n100\n00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.650\nSome commandlets in PowerShell you can\nuse that dash computer name option.\n\n101\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.710\nSome of them you can't.\n\n102\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.630\nSo you kind of wanna be just considering\nthat whenever you're using this invoke\n\n103\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.850\ncommand utility.\n\n104\n00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.710\nSo another thing I wanna show you is well,\nwhat if I had multiple commandlets and\n\n105\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.660\ntasks to execute on a remote server or\nsystem.\n\n106\n00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.710\nSo one way we can do that is actually\nby establishing that pssession.\n\n107\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.080\nSo we've already enabled it\non both my DC01 and my DM01.\n\n108\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.830\nSo what I want to do here is go ahead and\nestablish a session.\n\n109\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.165\nThe commandlet that I want to use\nis going to be Enter-PSSession.\n\n110\n00:06:10.418 --> 00:06:11.690\nFrom here, I'll go ahead and\n\n111\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.730\nspecify the computer name that\nI wanna enter the session with.\n\n112\n00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.914\nSo this is going to be computer name.\n\n113\n00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.055\nAnd we will just say DM01.\n\n114\n00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.605\nAnd also, when we go to hit Enter,\n\n115\n00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:32.590\nI want you to pay attention here to\none particular thing right here.\n\n116\n00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.155\nWe can now see that we\nare running as DM01.\n\n117\n00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.520\nSo this is kind of nice.\n\n118\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.979\nIf I wanted to run multiple commandlets,\n\n119\n00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:45.064\nthen I would be able to as long as\nthat session was still established.\n\n120\n00:06:45.064 --> 00:06:49.138\nSo for instance if I did an ipconfig\nhere and we'll just do /all so\n\n121\n00:06:49.138 --> 00:06:51.545\nwe can get all the extra information.\n\n122\n00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:56.828\nMy return is going to verify that yeah,\n\n123\n00:06:56.828 --> 00:07:00.356\nI just ran this on DM01.\n\n124\n00:07:00.356 --> 00:07:03.863\nAlthough physically I'm sitting here DM02,\n\n125\n00:07:03.863 --> 00:07:07.377\nI can access that by\nestablishing that session.\n\n126\n00:07:07.377 --> 00:07:11.500\nSo pretty cool, Ronnie.\n\n127\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.680\nIf I want to end a session,\nI just have to type.\n\n128\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.410\nLet me clear my screen here.\n\n129\n00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.820\nEven though I cleared my screen,\n\n130\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.210\nyou can still see that I\nam inside of that session.\n\n131\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.400\nSo you would just type in exit,\n\n132\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.960\nif I can type exit-pssession and\nhit Enter.\n\n133\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.490\nAnd you'll notice how it changed\nback to my local machine there.\n\n134\n00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.270\nSo that's something that\nyou wanna keep in mind.\n\n135\n00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.620\nThere's also another commandlet,\nRonnie, that, if, let's say,\n\n136\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.032\nI wanted to have access or\n\n137\n00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:48.090\nsessions, background sessions, of\nmultiple machines, I can do that as well.\n\n138\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.620\nThat's gonna be slightly different.\n\n139\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.290\nThat's going to be the new\n-pssession commandlet.\n\n140\n00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.011\nSo let's go ahead and say I want to\nstart a couple different sessions here.\n\n141\n00:07:57.011 --> 00:08:02.860\nSo I would type in New-PSSession.\n\n142\n00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.565\nAnd again,\nwe will have to specify the computer name.\n\n143\n00:08:07.806 --> 00:08:12.470\nSo let's see, DC01,\nwe'll hit Enter, all right.\n\n144\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.660\nWe can see the session ID has\nbeen created here, Session9.\n\n145\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.780\nNotice also the computer name.\n\n146\n00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.190\nThe state of the session is opened,\nopen for PowerShell.\n\n147\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.193\nI can go ahead and\nsend those PowerShell cmdlets.\n\n148\n00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:29.320\nAnd the status is available.\n\n149\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.120\nI think I might have some lingering\nsessions here in the background.\n\n150\n00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.567\nBut let's see when I was playing around.\n\n151\n00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:38.320\nNow let's go ahead, and\nI'll just use my up arrow here.\n\n152\n00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.874\nWe're gonna use that same command,\nthe New-PSSession, to go ahead and\n\n153\n00:08:42.874 --> 00:08:45.231\nestablish a new session with DM01.\n\n154\n00:08:49.516 --> 00:08:54.063\nNow we can see it's just gone\nconsecutively with those session IDs here\n\n155\n00:08:54.063 --> 00:08:55.071\nfor the names.\n\n156\n00:08:55.071 --> 00:09:00.820\nSession10 here for DMO1 has been opened.\n\n157\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.680\nSo if I have multiple sessions\nhow do I know if I'm calling\n\n158\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.500\nthe right one and\nworking on the correct machine?\n\n159\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.034\nSo, what I wanna do there is\njust type in Get-Session.\n\n160\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.080\nActually this is going to be PSSession.\n\n161\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.389\nAnd again, if I'm typing here,\nso let's say Get-PSSession.\n\n162\n00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:28.044\nNow this'll show, okay, so I do have\nsome older disconnected sessions here in\n\n163\n00:09:28.044 --> 00:09:31.109\nthe background,\nwhich it's kind of interesting.\n\n164\n00:09:31.109 --> 00:09:35.120\nIt's fine because I can show you the\ndifference here between that availability.\n\n165\n00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.744\nNotice how the active sessions are noted\non the right hand side here as Available,\n\n166\n00:09:40.744 --> 00:09:43.609\nwhereas the others are selected as None.\n\n167\n00:09:43.609 --> 00:09:45.550\nThe state is also different.\n\n168\n00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.760\nYou can see the difference\nbetween disconnected versus open.\n\n169\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.130\nAnd those are the same machine, so\nthey're just kind of lingering.\n\n170\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.667\nIt's not a big deal.\nBut if you wanted to go ahead and\n\n171\n00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:58.512\ndisconnect those open sessions that\nwe currently have then I would just\n\n172\n00:09:58.512 --> 00:10:03.130\nuse the same commandlet that I did\nhere and pipe it into another one.\n\n173\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.670\nSo, let's see what that would look like.\n\n174\n00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.631\nSo let me just go ahead and hit my up\narrow and then pipe that into disconnect.\n\n175\n00:10:14.402 --> 00:10:21.140\nThis is going to be Disconnect-PSSession\nand we'll hit Enter.\n\n176\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.840\nAnd now you can see that all of those\nsessions have been disconnected there.\n\n177\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.860\nBut if you wanted to go ahead and\npull out a session individually.\n\n178\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.000\nI probably should have done that first.\n\n179\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.090\nBut I wanna show you a way that\nyou can go ahead and do that.\n\n180\n00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.770\nSo I'm gonna go back to my\nGet-PSSession commandlet.\n\n181\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.094\nAnd so you just wanna,\nwell I already had it there.\n\n182\n00:10:42.094 --> 00:10:44.160\nYou could see the ID number.\n\n183\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.040\nSo if you wanted to call on\nthat session individually,\n\n184\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.050\nthat's an easy way that you would\nbe able to go ahead and specify.\n\n185\n00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.390\nSo if I wanted to, let's say,\nwell now that they're disconnected.\n\n186\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.090\nBut if I wanted to go ahead and establish\nconnectivity with a particular session,\n\n187\n00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.230\nthe commandlet that I would\nbe using would be Enter.\n\n188\n00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.965\nAnd then this is going to be -PSSession.\n\n189\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.680\nAnd I just specify the ID.\n\n190\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.230\nAnd then if I wanted to put in 3,\nthen because it's disconnected.\n\n191\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.060\nBut that's the syntax I wanted to show\nyou there so you would know that.\n\n192\n00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.820\nBut it's pretty cool.\n\n193\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.791\nI have the ability to not only\nestablish or send a one-time command.\n\n194\n00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:29.241\nI can actually have those sessions\nestablish just kind of in\n\n195\n00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:33.336\nthe background for me for\nquick and easy access there.\n\n196\n00:11:33.336 --> 00:11:37.270\nNow, [COUGH] just clearing my screen here.\n\n197\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.370\nAnother easy way that we can do this,\nI said,\n\n198\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.690\nwould be through the graphical\nuser interface, right?\n\n199\n00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.720\nSo, let's see.\n\n200\n00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.421\nI'm on DM02 and\nlet's just pull up Server Manager, oops.\n\n201\n00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:53.920\nAll right.\n\n202\n00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.060\nJust depending on whatever\nmachine you want to manage on,\n\n203\n00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.730\nremember whenever you're\ninstalling your roles and\n\n204\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.410\nfeatures you have that include\nmanagement tools option there.\n\n205\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.940\nSo you don't have to Install\nthe management tools\n\n206\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.770\non the actual server performing the job.\n\n207\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:17.490\nSo whatever server, whatever machine\nyou're using to manage that server,\n\n208\n00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.760\nthat's where those tools need to reside.\n\n209\n00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.400\nSo you wanna keep that in mind.\n\n210\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.270\nOtherwise, you're not gonna be\nable to have this capability here.\n\n211\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.000\nSo whether it be on a DM02 or\n\n212\n00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.190\non a client system you just kinda\nwanna keep that in mind here.\n\n213\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.630\nAll right, so\nI can see my local server right here.\n\n214\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.030\nBut what if I wanted to add additional\nservers and create groups and\n\n215\n00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.760\nserver pools?\n\n216\n00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.710\nThat's something I\ndefinitely can able to do.\n\n217\n00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.200\nI would just select from the top\nright hand corner under Manage and\n\n218\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.500\nthen hit Add Servers.\n\n219\n00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.040\nAnd let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n220\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.170\nI can create, add an individual server.\n\n221\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.310\nAnd then once I have multiple servers\nthen I can also create groups.\n\n222\n00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.410\nAnd why might I do that?\n\n223\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.480\nWell, If we think about\nlarger environments and\n\n224\n00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.150\nI have different domain controllers,\n\n225\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.870\nmaybe there are settings that I wanna\npush out only to domain controllers.\n\n226\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.477\nSo it's an easy way for me to group and\n\n227\n00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:18.278\norganize by creating those\ndifferent groups there.\n\n228\n00:13:18.278 --> 00:13:21.870\nSo now that I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd a server I'm in DM02.\n\n229\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.300\nSo let me just go ahead and type in DC01.\n\n230\n00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.650\nAnd we'll look for that machine here.\n\n231\n00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.350\nWe'll hit Find Now.\n\n232\n00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:32.990\nSo once we see it being propagated\ninto this bottom field,\n\n233\n00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:38.600\nwe do need to highlight it and move it on\nover for us to be able to manage it here.\n\n234\n00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.190\nWe could also find our other machine here.\n\n235\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.490\nThis is going to be DM01.\n\n236\n00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.208\nWe'll hit Find Now,\njust add a couple in for us.\n\n237\n00:13:53.837 --> 00:13:54.858\n&gt;&gt; You have to hit the right arrow.\n\n238\n00:13:57.317 --> 00:13:57.875\nThere you go.\n\n239\n00:13:57.875 --> 00:14:01.269\n&gt;&gt; There we go, got him in there.\n\n240\n00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:05.238\nSo now on the left hand side here, I'm\nstill looking at the interface just for\n\n241\n00:14:05.238 --> 00:14:06.228\nmy local machine.\n\n242\n00:14:06.228 --> 00:14:08.805\nBut I do wanna make sure that\nI click on all servers, so\n\n243\n00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:11.115\nI can see those other\nservers that I just added.\n\n244\n00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:15.046\nSo, remember DM02, that's the machine\nthat we're physically on here.\n\n245\n00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:18.660\nAnd then we just added DCL1 and DM01.\n\n246\n00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:23.390\nSo this is pretty cool that I had now have\nthe capabilities to access these machines\n\n247\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.730\nright here from within Server Manager.\n\n248\n00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.000\nOne interface to quickly just\npick my different machines.\n\n249\n00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.810\nSo for instance, I could just right click.\n\n250\n00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.528\nAnd I have a lot of options here.\n\n251\n00:14:32.528 --> 00:14:35.850\nThis is going to be options for my DC01.\n\n252\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.080\nSo I could add roles and\nfeature, restart the server.\n\n253\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.610\nWe've got computer management.\n\n254\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.560\nAs you can see, there are several\ndifferent things that I can, and\n\n255\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.680\neven, they've grouped some really\nhandy utilities right here,\n\n256\n00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.070\nsome executables from\nwithin this interface.\n\n257\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.790\nSo, I could even launch\nour Windows Powershell.\n\n258\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.490\nSo, now, if I zoom in, again,\nyou guys can see that.\n\n259\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.410\nI'm actually, see that, there you go.\n\n260\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.920\nSo here, I'm actually on DC01.\n\n261\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.800\nSo I don't know, pretty cool.\n\n262\n00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.260\nI think that it's a great\nway that they've really\n\n263\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.200\ntried to beef up remote management here so\nyou could just type in.\n\n264\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.015\nI don't know.\nAgain, on our domain controller, we had,\n\n265\n00:15:17.015 --> 00:15:18.590\nit's kinda small here.\n\n266\n00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.642\nBut, let's see,\nI'm just going to change that so\n\n267\n00:15:20.642 --> 00:15:22.281\nwe can see what we're doing real quick.\n\n268\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.080\nSo earlier, we just checked for\nthat DNS service.\n\n269\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:40.370\nSo you could just say, again, Get-Service,\nand then call it out by name here.\n\n270\n00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.380\nAnd we can see that it's running.\n\n271\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.194\nAnd if we wanted to go ahead and\nstop and restart that service,\n\n272\n00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:46.494\nwe could do that here from\nwithin Server Manager.\n\n273\n00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:51.160\nSo there's a couple different ways\nthat we can actually use graphical.\n\n274\n00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.970\nWe can use command line utilities.\n\n275\n00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.600\nAnd they're all really piggy backing\noff of this WinRM capability.\n\n276\n00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.460\nSo I think that's about it for\nnow, Ronnie.\n\n277\n00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.350\nAll right, Cherokee.\n\n278\n00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.640\nWell, thank you again for helping us out\nwith the idea of remote management here.\n\n279\n00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.535\nWe took a look of course\nat using PowerShell and\n\n280\n00:16:06.535 --> 00:16:11.064\nthe PSSession as well as PSRemoting to\nallow us to actually gain a bit more\n\n281\n00:16:11.064 --> 00:16:15.616\nunderstanding in using that PowerShell\nacross multiple machines too.\n\n282\n00:16:15.616 --> 00:16:19.014\nAnd then lastly of course,\nusing the Server Manager itself gives\n\n283\n00:16:19.014 --> 00:16:23.302\nus another way of being able to access and\nusing that remote management, as well.\n\n284\n00:16:23.302 --> 00:16:24.780\nCherokee, any last words?\n\n285\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.470\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n286\n00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.960\nI did wanna show one more thing, Ronnie.\n\n287\n00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.840\nLet me go ahead and pull that up.\n\n288\n00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.770\nOkay, once I installed my RSAT tools\non my Window's 10 Client that will also\n\n289\n00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:37.140\ngive me the ability to access a couple\ndifferent graphical tools here as well.\n\n290\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.750\nSo let's just see.\n\n291\n00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:43.040\nIf I type in features and\nI pull up my Turn Windows Features on or\n\n292\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.360\noff this will give me the option to\ngo ahead and use that here as well.\n\n293\n00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.910\nNow you'll notice that there\nare more options than if I had not\n\n294\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.150\ninstalled my RSAT tools.\n\n295\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.580\nAnd sometimes you don't even want\nto give out as many options for\n\n296\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.910\nActive Directory services and so forth.\n\n297\n00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.860\nSo, you might just wanna keep that in mind\nwhen installing that for others here.\n\n298\n00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:10.790\nNow, another graphical tool that you can\nuse from clients here to remotely manage\n\n299\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:15.540\nwill be your MMC Console or\nyour Microsoft Management Console.\n\n300\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.690\nSo I'm just right clicking on my\nstart button and selecting Run.\n\n301\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.459\nI already have that typed in here.\n\n302\n00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:25.281\nSo I've got my MMC and we'll hit OK.\n\n303\n00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.470\nAnd we will allow, let me zoom out so\nyou guys can see what that looks like.\n\n304\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.950\nIt'll just say, do you wanna allow this\napp to make changes to your device?\n\n305\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:34.830\nAnd we'll hit Yes.\n\n306\n00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.540\nIf you're not familiar with using MMC,\nand you can see the icon here,\n\n307\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.000\nthat's what the logo looks like,\nit's like a toolbox.\n\n308\n00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.980\nAnd it's kind of cool\nbecause you can create and\n\n309\n00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.740\ndesign your own custom toolkit here.\n\n310\n00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.640\nSo If there's, maybe you're\nworking on a particular project,\n\n311\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.810\nyou're in Active Directory or\nsomething else or\n\n312\n00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.270\nyou're scheduling a lot of tasks,\nif you're using a tool frequently,\n\n313\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.500\nyou can kind of bundle them together for\neasy access and even save them.\n\n314\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.970\nSo let's see what we've\ngot available to us.\n\n315\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.432\nSo if I go into File here, then I\ncould just say Add or Remove Snap-In.\n\n316\n00:18:08.432 --> 00:18:12.280\nAnd this is where I have the ability.\n\n317\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:18.680\nRSAT will allow me to then take\nthese management tools and put them\n\n318\n00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.190\nright into this management console for me\nto go ahead and manage right on my client.\n\n319\n00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.430\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n320\n00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:28.328\nAnd when we're talking about\nthe day-to-day remote management\n\n321\n00:18:28.328 --> 00:18:31.840\nof our servers I mean this\nis just really great.\n\n322\n00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.265\nYou could go in and like I said,\nyou see all sorts of different options.\n\n323\n00:18:35.265 --> 00:18:40.190\nSo you can manage DHCP right\nhere from your client side.\n\n324\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.600\nSo pretty cool.\n\n325\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.798\nI think that's about it,\nRonnie, for real this time.\n\n326\n00:18:44.798 --> 00:18:47.586\n&gt;&gt; Al right, Cherokee, thank you again for\nhelping us to understand that.\n\n327\n00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:51.250\nBut this is a great place to end for\nus to go and end this episode.\n\n328\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.200\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n329\n00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.092\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n330\n00:18:56.092 --> 00:19:01.609\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410

00:00:11.694\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:15.294\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:15.294 --> 00:00:19.290\nyou're watching the NCSA for\nWindows server 2012.\n\n6\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.450\nWe're specifically addressing\nthe courts exam 70-410, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.764\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:23.764 --> 00:00:27.333\nToday we are actually gonna be covering\na Part Three, in taking a look in,\n\n9\n00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.570\nof course, remote management\ninside a Windows server 2012.\n\n10\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.504\nAnd here to help us out to understand that\nbetter is gonna be Ms.Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:34.504 --> 00:00:35.929\nCherokee welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:37.561\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\nhaving me Ronnie how are you doing today?\n\n13\n00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:40.856\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, now Cherokee\nhere we are, we are in Part Three,\n\n14\n00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:44.600\nwhich means we've covered a lot\nof the different technologies.\n\n15\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.848\nSo what do we actually have\nto take a look at, here?\n\n16\n00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:51.678\n&gt;&gt; Okay Ronnie, so,\nwhen we think about remote management and\n\n17\n00:00:51.678 --> 00:00:54.580\nfrom a security perspective.\n\n18\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.085\nOf course we should be using firewalls\nin our environments, that's definitely\n\n19\n00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.140\nsomething that we wanna take a look\nat when it comes to configuration.\n\n20\n00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.350\nBecause it's not always\ngonna be a walk in the park.\n\n21\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.970\nSometimes you may experience\ndifferent instances or\n\n22\n00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.040\nconfigurations that give you errors and\nprohibit that communication.\n\n23\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.624\nSo, I just wanna spend a little bit of\nextra time here to make sure that we're\n\n24\n00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:15.637\nfully aware of that.\n\n25\n00:01:15.637 --> 00:01:17.490\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, so\nwhere are we gonna begin?\n\n26\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.068\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's begin here in\nour Advanced Firewall Settings.\n\n27\n00:01:21.068 --> 00:01:24.110\nSo, I have a domain member that\nI'd like to share with you.\n\n28\n00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.812\nAnd so you could either pull\nup Administration Tools and\n\n29\n00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:29.158\nget there that way.\n\n30\n00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:36.236\nAnd let's just scroll down here, We've got\nWindows Firewall with Advanced Security.\n\n31\n00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:40.560\nI do wanna show you a quick little\nshortcut that I like to use sometimes.\n\n32\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.840\nIf you just right click on the start menu,\nand select run, and it's already in there.\n\n33\n00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.035\nSo we have wf.msc, and\nthat's just a quick way to go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:52.630\npull up your Windows Firewall there.\n\n35\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.744\nSo what we wanna look at is, the inbound\ncommunications here, inbound rules.\n\n36\n00:02:03.744 --> 00:02:06.260\nAnd there are quite a few here.\n\n37\n00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.324\nThe ones that we'll be working with,\nhopefully,\n\n38\n00:02:08.324 --> 00:02:09.820\nthey're already there by default.\n\n39\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.084\nGuys just remember if something\ndoes happen to those rules,\n\n40\n00:02:13.084 --> 00:02:15.324\nthen you do have\nthe ability to go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:19.357\nregenerate over on the right hand side\nover here with that new rule option.\n\n42\n00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:24.330\nNow we've already talked about\ndifferent tools that can help\n\n43\n00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.780\neasily create these rules for us, right?\n\n44\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.323\nBut sometimes things don't\nalways go according to plan, so\n\n45\n00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:35.636\nI just wanna make sure you know where\nto go, what to look for sort of thing.\n\n46\n00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:37.923\nNow when we were talking about WinRM,\n\n47\n00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:41.220\nthere's a particular rule\nthat we've already seen.\n\n48\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.260\nI just wanna remind you of that and\nlet me kind of pull this out,\n\n49\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.860\nso we can see exactly what\nwe're dealing with here.\n\n50\n00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.300\nAnd our groups cuz,\nthis is kind of important too,\n\n51\n00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.895\nto be aware of the fact that some of these\nrules work together as a group or a team.\n\n52\n00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:05.146\nAnd a lot of times in my\nopinion it's just easier to\n\n53\n00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:10.006\nuse the rule group instead of\ngoing through and setting or\n\n54\n00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:14.170\ndisabling each individual\nrule individually.\n\n55\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.000\nSo, with our Windows remote management,\nokay?\n\n56\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.860\nThis is going to be that particular\nrule that we wanna have enabled in\n\n57\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.120\norder to be able to connect\nremotely via WinRM, right?\n\n58\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.780\nSo WinRM is going to be that\ntechnology that we spoke about and\n\n59\n00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.650\nhooking into that WMI Structure, right.\n\n60\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.227\nBut that's not always the case.\n\n61\n00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:41.269\nWhen we take a look at some of\nthe older technologies like DCOM,\n\n62\n00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.028\nthey're not gonna be using\nthe WinRM technology, here.\n\n63\n00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:48.280\nSo they're gonna be using, not the soap\nthat we have spoke about before.\n\n64\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.562\nThey're gonna be using\nsomething a little bit older.\n\n65\n00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:53.808\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee what are some\nof the technologies you're mentioning?\n\n66\n00:03:53.808 --> 00:03:56.008\nGive us an example of what uses DCOM.\n\n67\n00:03:56.008 --> 00:04:00.924\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so older tried and true\ngraphical user interface, that we've even\n\n68\n00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:05.930\nspoke about is going to be the MMC\nconsole, Microsoft Management Console.\n\n69\n00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.835\nSo Microsoft Management Console uses\nDistributed Component Object Model, and\n\n70\n00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:13.295\nthat's the underpinning technology.\n\n71\n00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:17.840\nAnd DCOM also is reliant\non four different firewall\n\n72\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.960\nrules to be enabled in order for\nit to work.\n\n73\n00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.483\nSo here we are,\nwe're thinking things are great.\n\n74\n00:04:23.483 --> 00:04:26.060\nI'm able to remote in and do some work.\n\n75\n00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.083\nBut then I try to pull up my Microsoft\nManagement console and nothing's working.\n\n76\n00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:35.404\nAnd that's where firewall would come in\nreally handy here to make sure that those\n\n77\n00:04:35.404 --> 00:04:37.130\nfour rules are enabled.\n\n78\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.693\nAnd then we'll take a look at,\nwhat we can do if they're not enabled, and\n\n79\n00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:42.085\nhow we can actually do that.\n\n80\n00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:44.856\nSo currently, and\nlet me just look for those,\n\n81\n00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:48.030\nfor our\nWindows Firewall Remote Management.\n\n82\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.426\nSo you can even see here that\nActually let me zoom in,\n\n83\n00:04:50.426 --> 00:04:51.958\nI don't know if you can see that.\n\n84\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.431\nBut RPC, remote procedure call,\n\n85\n00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:58.785\nis going to be what we're seeing\nassociated with this rule.\n\n86\n00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:03.757\nSo that's one and two of the four there.\n\n87\n00:05:03.757 --> 00:05:08.564\nBut I just wanna show you some of the\nthings you can see that it is not enabled,\n\n88\n00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:09.100\nright.\n\n89\n00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.940\nSo it's great out here for those, two.\n\n90\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.820\nAnd we'll go into Netsh and\n\n91\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.740\nwe'll take a look at how we can\nactually turn different rules on there.\n\n92\n00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.667\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee,\n\n93\n00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:22.325\nthe other rules that we're actually\ntaking a look at here, right?\n\n94\n00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:26.985\nIs really the idea of actually taking a\nlook at the remote event logs too, right?\n\n95\n00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:31.835\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so let me pull up TechNet\nin the, they have them listed.\n\n96\n00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:34.585\nAnd this link is also in the show notes.\n\n97\n00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:35.735\nSo don't worry about that.\n\n98\n00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.590\nYou guys have access to it.\n\n99\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.140\nNow let me just go ahead and\nfind exactly where they're listed here.\n\n100\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.470\nIf I can,\nit might be in a different link here.\n\n101\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.865\nI can tell you what they are.\nIt's gonna be the com plus for\n\n102\n00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:53.420\nyour network access.\n\n103\n00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.340\nIt's going to be three of those remote\nlog management ones that Ronnie was just\n\n104\n00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.770\nreferencing there.\n\n105\n00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.074\nBut, the command that we wanna\ngo ahead and use is Netsh.\n\n106\n00:06:02.074 --> 00:06:05.604\nNow Ronnie, Netsh has been around for\na very long time, so\n\n107\n00:06:05.604 --> 00:06:08.960\nmaybe you're familiar with it,\nmaybe you're not.\n\n108\n00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.360\nSo I'm not gonna assume that you are and\n\n109\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.340\nwe'll take a look at how we will\nactually begin to use that tool as well.\n\n110\n00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.120\nSo the first command that you\nwant to make sure is ran is\n\n111\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.290\nthe Netsh advanced\nfirewall set rule group.\n\n112\n00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.637\nBecause without that you're\nnot gonna be able to actually\n\n113\n00:06:28.637 --> 00:06:32.505\nconfigure additional settings in that way,\nokay.\n\n114\n00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:35.820\nSo, let's take a look at how\nthat is here within PowerShell.\n\n115\n00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.760\nLet me pull that up on\nour domain member here.\n\n116\n00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:49.014\nOkay, Netsh is one of those commands.\n\n117\n00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:49.728\nWhen I type it in,\n\n118\n00:06:49.728 --> 00:06:53.032\nyou're gonna see how it changes over on\nthe left hand side with that carrot there.\n\n119\n00:06:53.032 --> 00:06:59.930\nSo I'm actually, entering a session\nlike it's the Netsh utility here.\n\n120\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.684\nSo, let's go ahead and just type in\na question mark to see all the different\n\n121\n00:07:03.684 --> 00:07:06.077\noptions that we have here\nwith this Netsh tool.\n\n122\n00:07:06.077 --> 00:07:14.045\nSo, you can see the advanced firewall\nthat we had just on the TechNet page.\n\n123\n00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:17.918\nThere's also one that I kinda just wanna\nhighlight here, it's pretty important for\n\n124\n00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:20.605\nthat set, because what that's gonna do,\nwill go ahead and\n\n125\n00:07:20.605 --> 00:07:22.465\nupdate those configuration settings.\n\n126\n00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:27.314\nThat you may be working with\nhere in this utility, all right.\n\n127\n00:07:30.127 --> 00:07:34.990\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntype in advfirewall, And\n\n128\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.610\ntake a look at the different\nhelp options that it has here.\n\n129\n00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:44.010\nSo, just knowing that you do\nhave some help here is great.\n\n130\n00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:49.390\nSo, gives you a little bit\nof syntax options as well.\n\n131\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.436\nThe command that we're gonna actually be\nusing is the one that we just saw on that\n\n132\n00:07:52.436 --> 00:07:53.037\nTechNet page.\n\n133\n00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:58.596\nSo let me go ahead and type that out,\nthis is going to be, Net SH ADV advanced\n\n134\n00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:04.362\nfirewall And then firewall again because\nwe love to make sure things happen.\n\n135\n00:08:04.362 --> 00:08:08.436\nAnd we're gonna use that set command that\nI had showed you there and highlighted.\n\n136\n00:08:08.436 --> 00:08:14.300\nSo set and this is going to\nbe a rule group, not ruley.\n\n137\n00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:20.920\n[COUGH] And when we take a look at this.\n\n138\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.450\nMicrosoft they have remote administration\nas a rule group on some of their\n\n139\n00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.610\ntetnet pages Ronnie.\n\n140\n00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.797\nAnd this really tripped me up because I\ndon't know if they deleted that group.\n\n141\n00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:31.750\nIt doesn't really exist.\n\n142\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.705\nThe one I just showed you guys is what\nI'm gonna use and what works for me.\n\n143\n00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:36.990\nSo that's what we're gonna use today.\n\n144\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.840\nAnd that's on that Tech Net page\nthat's in the show notes as well.\n\n145\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.110\nSo that's going to be Windows Firewall\n\n146\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:51.652\nremote management.\n\n147\n00:08:51.652 --> 00:08:57.590\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\nsay new, and then give it a new label\n\n148\n00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:04.557\nEquals Yes.\n\n149\n00:09:04.557 --> 00:09:09.090\nAll right and let's scroll down here so\nwe can see what happened.\n\n150\n00:09:16.747 --> 00:09:19.395\nHold on it says that I\nmight have a bad syntax,\n\n151\n00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:22.035\nokay let me just check that really quick.\n\n152\n00:09:22.035 --> 00:09:28.615\nSo net SH advance firewall,\nfirewalls set rule group = Windows\n\n153\n00:09:28.615 --> 00:09:34.820\nfirewall remote management And\nthat is going to be new enable yes.\n\n154\n00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:45.900\nAll right, let me just make sure\nthat that net sh isn't here.\n\n155\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.010\nMaybe I had typed that in.\n\n156\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.450\nI didn't think that I had but let's see.\n\n157\n00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:58.019\nIs because you're actually inside\nof the netsh advanced firewall so\n\n158\n00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.020\nyou have to kinda get all-\n&gt;&gt; I'll back out.\n\n159\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.140\nAll right, let me go ahead and do that.\n\n160\n00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.910\nLet me just type in exit.\n\n161\n00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.650\nSometimes if you go,\nI did show you guys that first.\n\n162\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:11.810\nAll right, so now I have to type in netsh,\nand now rerun that command.\n\n163\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.880\nHere we go.\n\n164\n00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.360\nOkay, thank you, Ronnie.\n\n165\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.570\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Jeez Louise.\n\n166\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.015\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to follow it too, so.\n\n167\n00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:18.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, sometimes it happens.\n\n168\n00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.480\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n169\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.230\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it does,\nit has those different levels.\n\n170\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.810\nOnce you go into it then\nyou have to back back out.\n\n171\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.060\nAll right, so now, let me zoom in so\nyou guys can see this.\n\n172\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.320\nIt says, Updated 2 rule(s).\n\n173\n00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.720\nThose two that I had showed you before.\n\n174\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.700\nI just wanna kinda show\nyou how this tool works so\n\n175\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.200\nthat if you do get stuck in\nthis kind of predicament,\n\n176\n00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.050\nthen you'll at least know where to start,\nwhere to get some helps that you're not\n\n177\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.938\ndealing with all these firewall\nissues that they kind of have.\n\n178\n00:10:43.938 --> 00:10:48.220\nSo, all right,\nI have two firewalls open here.\n\n179\n00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.100\nI don't know which one\nis the most accurate.\n\n180\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.820\nSo we're gonna hit Refresh\non the side over here.\n\n181\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.650\nAnd we'll take a look at those\ntwo rules that we just changed.\n\n182\n00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.230\nAll right, so these are the two that\nwe are really focusing in on there.\n\n183\n00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.970\nAnd you can see that they are now enabled.\n\n184\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.620\nSo just taking advantage\nof that net sh tool,\n\n185\n00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.650\nIs something you might want to consider.\n\n186\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.930\nAnd definitely check out my notes,\n\n187\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.020\nand the links that I've provided\nin the show notes for you as well.\n\n188\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.510\nOkay, another option that\nwe have available to us,\n\n189\n00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.260\nlet me just exit out of NET SH here.\n\n190\n00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.480\nAnd, okay, clear the screen so\nit's nice and beautiful.\n\n191\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.970\nAnd you can see here, now we're just back\nhere at the Powershell under my loop.\n\n192\n00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.520\nThere's another tool, Ronnie,\nand it's called SM Remoting.\n\n193\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.270\nSo configure-SMRemoting.exe is\nactually the tool that we're using.\n\n194\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:50.345\nAnd what this does for\nus is enable, because we wanna\n\n195\n00:11:50.345 --> 00:11:55.285\ntake advantage of all the features,\nwe don't always want to, but\n\n196\n00:11:55.285 --> 00:11:58.995\nif you want to, I'm telling you how you\ncan take advantage of all of the features.\n\n197\n00:11:58.995 --> 00:12:03.415\nSo, let's say, I wanted to use\nserver manager and be able to\n\n198\n00:12:03.415 --> 00:12:06.965\nintegrate that remote machine within\nthe server manager and access it that way.\n\n199\n00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:12.360\nThis particular component here,\nit connects with an API.\n\n200\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.000\nSo we actually have an API\n\n201\n00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.060\nwhich integrates with us which is really\nnice because we can utilize scripts.\n\n202\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.870\nSo if I wanted to take advantage of that,\n\n203\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:25.200\nthen my SM remoting tool\nis what I would be using.\n\n204\n00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.970\nSo let's take a look here in PowerShell\nand see how we can set that up.\n\n205\n00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:34.170\nSo first of all I'm gonna go ahead and\ntype in configure.\n\n206\n00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.535\nJust make sure I\"m typing here.\n\n207\n00:12:39.535 --> 00:12:40.622\nSM remoting.\n\n208\n00:12:43.336 --> 00:12:45.368\nAll right, .exc.\n\n209\n00:12:45.368 --> 00:12:50.250\nAnd let's just do a -get\nto see the current status.\n\n210\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.440\nI wanna make sure that hey, I haven't set\nthis up yet on this machine and yeah,\n\n211\n00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.180\nwe can see that it is disabled, okay?\n\n212\n00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.160\nThe next thing I wanna do.\n\n213\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.630\nThere's only three I think\nthere's only three options here.\n\n214\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.320\nYou’ve got get.\n\n215\n00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.640\nYou’ve got enable and disable.\n\n216\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.730\nSo FYI there's not a ton that you have\nto memorize here once you are shopping.\n\n217\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.040\nSo let's go ahead and enable that.\n\n218\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.180\nSo let's just backup.\n\n219\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:16.790\nUse my upper.\n\n220\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.110\nI wanna say enable.\n\n221\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.680\nAll right, we can just see it is enabled.\n\n222\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.600\nAll right, so we've configured\nthe firewall to accept those\n\n223\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.070\nconnections to utilize those API features.\n\n224\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.470\nSo that's what we just did with this tool.\n\n225\n00:13:35.818 --> 00:13:40.578\nAll right, so\nInstead of taking advantage of setting all\n\n226\n00:13:40.578 --> 00:13:45.437\nthose rules at one time,\nin certain instances there may be\n\n227\n00:13:45.437 --> 00:13:51.310\nsituations where you want to\nconfigure each rule independently.\n\n228\n00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.810\nSo let me show you how you\nwould go ahead and do that.\n\n229\n00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.530\nFirst of all,\nlet me just clear my screen here.\n\n230\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.931\nIf I can type, that would help.\n\n231\n00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.100\nAll right, so now that we are good to go.\n\n232\n00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.870\nLet's just do a get dash help.\n\n233\n00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.990\nAnd what I want to be looking at\nhere is specifically for firewall.\n\n234\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.650\nIt's gonna come in hand because there\nare so many different firewall rules and\n\n235\n00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.360\nyou guys will see this.\n\n236\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.260\nI just don't want you to get overwhelmed.\n\n237\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.430\nThere are help and there's no shame in\nusing this, that's what it's here for so.\n\n238\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.710\nAll right,\n[LAUGH] we're just beginning here\n\n239\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:39.140\nbecause what we really want to\nfocus in on Is going to be our net.\n\n240\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.960\nThis is going to be our net firewall rule.\n\n241\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.950\nSo our rules is what we wanna focus in on.\n\n242\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.990\nCuz remember, I said, we wanna set\nthose rules individually here.\n\n243\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.760\nSo if we go into this rule section here,\n\n244\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.390\nwe can actually see the correct syntax for\nthat.\n\n245\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.880\nSo let's type that in.\n\n246\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.470\nAnd we'll see.\n\n247\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.370\nNow this is kinda where it gets a little\noverwhelming, Ronnie, there's so\n\n248\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.320\nmany different rules.\n\n249\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.250\nBut that's okay,\nI'll show you how you can filter them out.\n\n250\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:10.370\nIf I can spell firewall, and\nthis is going to be rule.\n\n251\n00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:14.730\nGive it a second, here.\n\n252\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.120\nThere it goes.\n\n253\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.655\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot.\n\n254\n00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:29.950\n[LAUGH] So how we can go ahead and\n\n255\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.710\nfilter that out a little bit\nis what I wanna show you.\n\n256\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.750\nMy goodness gracious,\nmaybe this was a bad idea.\n\n257\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.100\nBut you get the point, right?\n\n258\n00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.210\nThere's just so many different rules.\n\n259\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:46.445\nAnd actually when you looked right\nat the beginning of this show\n\n260\n00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:52.485\nI showed you the rule that was associated\nwith the Win RN functionality.\n\n261\n00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:55.181\nAnd so that's what we really\nwanna take a look at here.\n\n262\n00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:58.642\nIf you didn't know, okay, let's stop that.\n\n263\n00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:03.555\n&gt;&gt; Crucer.\n\n264\n00:16:03.555 --> 00:16:05.583\nThere we go.\n\n265\n00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:08.391\nIf you didn't already know\nthe name of that particular rule,\n\n266\n00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:10.335\nthat's why I wanted to show you that here.\n\n267\n00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:12.429\nSo the Windows remote management.\n\n268\n00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.651\nSo just looking at what\nthe rule is called,\n\n269\n00:16:14.651 --> 00:16:16.951\nbecause sometimes you might not remember.\n\n270\n00:16:16.951 --> 00:16:22.595\nThere might be a slight discrepancy and it\ncan get a little fuzzy, but let's go back.\n\n271\n00:16:22.595 --> 00:16:26.159\nSo if you already have an idea of\nwhat the rule is like a few words,\n\n272\n00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:30.069\nwe can use wild cards with asterisks\nto help us find it a little easier.\n\n273\n00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:34.153\nSo the more accurate and\nthe more information you can provide,\n\n274\n00:16:34.153 --> 00:16:38.478\nthat list is gonna be shrinking\nwhen you're setting these rules.\n\n275\n00:16:38.478 --> 00:16:41.511\nThe first one I wanna go ahead and\nlet's see here.\n\n276\n00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:46.180\nI already know that we\nhave a huge list here.\n\n277\n00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.525\nSo, what we're gonna do is\nlet me just clear the screen.\n\n278\n00:16:49.525 --> 00:16:51.459\nSo, it's at the top for us to look at.\n\n279\n00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:56.462\n[LAUGH] Actually, let me go ahead and\nbump this font up.\n\n280\n00:16:56.462 --> 00:16:58.536\nMaybe that'll help me in my typing.\n\n281\n00:16:58.536 --> 00:16:59.892\nWhat do you think, Ronnie?\n\n282\n00:16:59.892 --> 00:17:00.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could.\n\n283\n00:17:00.494 --> 00:17:05.107\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We will just pull down\na little bit, so we can all see that.\n\n284\n00:17:07.988 --> 00:17:12.737\nSo now what we are about to be doing is\nreally just filtering in those search\n\n285\n00:17:12.737 --> 00:17:16.122\nresults, so\nI don't have to deal with all of those.\n\n286\n00:17:16.122 --> 00:17:20.189\nSo, let my just type in\nmy GET-NET firewall.\n\n287\n00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:24.932\nAnd of course,\nyou guys could use the auto tab feature.\n\n288\n00:17:24.932 --> 00:17:26.340\nYou know just how I feel about that.\n\n289\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.268\nI'm just gonna type it all out,\nso we can remember this.\n\n290\n00:17:29.268 --> 00:17:34.857\nSo it's GET-NET firewall rule and\nwe'll specify, and\n\n291\n00:17:34.857 --> 00:17:39.874\nwe'll go ahead, and\nuse the pipe parameter here.\n\n292\n00:17:39.874 --> 00:17:44.537\nSo space and then pipe that in to take\nthe output of that huge, long list and\n\n293\n00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:47.941\nthen we're gonna kind of\nfilter it down a little bit.\n\n294\n00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:55.105\nSo we'll pipe that into select-object,\nselect-object.\n\n295\n00:17:57.814 --> 00:17:59.638\nWe're gonna specify property name.\n\n296\n00:18:05.993 --> 00:18:07.220\nDisplay name.\n\n297\n00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.089\nWhat.\n\n298\n00:18:12.089 --> 00:18:13.382\nDisplay name is one word.\n\n299\n00:18:13.382 --> 00:18:14.745\nProperty name is two words.\n\n300\n00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:17.804\nIt's a little strange,\nbut that's just how it is.\n\n301\n00:18:17.804 --> 00:18:21.047\nNow we're gonna go ahead and\ntake that output, and\n\n302\n00:18:21.047 --> 00:18:23.244\npipe it into one more filter here.\n\n303\n00:18:23.244 --> 00:18:28.258\nWe're gonna create a little alias and\nsay, where and use our curly brackets.\n\n304\n00:18:28.258 --> 00:18:30.471\nSo we've got $_.\n\n305\n00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:33.712\nTo go ahead and specify that where and\nwe'll say, where that display name?\n\n306\n00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:39.698\nAnd it's kind of wrapping around here,\nmy size is a little.\n\n307\n00:18:39.698 --> 00:18:42.962\nSo n and then a, n, e.\n\n308\n00:18:42.962 --> 00:18:48.575\nWe're the display name is going\nto be like, so dash like.\n\n309\n00:18:48.575 --> 00:18:53.904\nAnd this is where we can use our asterisks\nto go ahead and use it as a wild card,\n\n310\n00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:57.757\nbut we do need to remember\nto keep that in parenthesis.\n\n311\n00:18:57.757 --> 00:18:59.281\nOr excuse me, quotation marks.\n\n312\n00:18:59.281 --> 00:19:00.783\nBecause of the spaces here.\n\n313\n00:19:00.783 --> 00:19:06.091\nSo we'll say, quotation mark and\nthen wild card and Windows.\n\n314\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.817\nThis is going to be remote management.\n\n315\n00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:14.307\nSo, the rules that are associated\nwith Windows remote management\n\n316\n00:19:14.307 --> 00:19:17.686\nis what we should be seeing\nhere with this cmdlet.\n\n317\n00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:32.104\nWe'll go ahead and hit Enter and\nthis is a whole lot.\n\n318\n00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:35.651\nI guess I will say, it's more manageable\nthan the list that we saw before.\n\n319\n00:19:35.651 --> 00:19:41.300\nSo if I really wanted to take a look\nat what the correct syntax is for\n\n320\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.543\nthose rules.\n\n321\n00:19:42.543 --> 00:19:44.943\nSo I see my display name and\njust remember,\n\n322\n00:19:44.943 --> 00:19:49.012\nthere is a difference here with\nthe actual display name versus the name,\n\n323\n00:19:49.012 --> 00:19:51.897\nthe syntax that I'll be\nusing within PowerShell.\n\n324\n00:19:51.897 --> 00:19:55.131\nSo, that's what I really wanted\nto point out to you guys.\n\n325\n00:19:55.131 --> 00:19:59.872\nI could even to make things easy\non myself just highlight it and\n\n326\n00:19:59.872 --> 00:20:03.791\nthen come down here and say,\nadd it and then copy and\n\n327\n00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:07.637\nwhat I will do here is if I\nwanted to use the enable.\n\n328\n00:20:07.637 --> 00:20:14.139\nSo enable-net, firewall rule.\n\n329\n00:20:14.139 --> 00:20:17.888\nSo, I'm actually enabling one\nindividual rule at this moment in time.\n\n330\n00:20:17.888 --> 00:20:20.395\nSo if I needed to do that\nat that granular level.\n\n331\n00:20:20.395 --> 00:20:24.592\nSpecifying the name and\nsince I already copied it,\n\n332\n00:20:24.592 --> 00:20:28.993\nI'll just come up here and\nsay, edit and then paste.\n\n333\n00:20:28.993 --> 00:20:31.254\nAnd so now, I just hit Enter.\n\n334\n00:20:31.254 --> 00:20:34.831\nAnd if we hop back into the firewall here,\nso\n\n335\n00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:39.095\nthe one that I'm looking for\nis WinRM-HTTP-end.\n\n336\n00:20:39.095 --> 00:20:43.574\nSo, this is the particular rule\nthat's associated with our WinRM.\n\n337\n00:20:43.574 --> 00:20:46.981\nLet me just hit Refresh\nto get accurate info.\n\n338\n00:20:46.981 --> 00:20:51.942\nAnd of course,\nit's all the way at the bottom there.\n\n339\n00:20:51.942 --> 00:20:55.880\nAnd so now,\nwe can see that it is enabled both for\n\n340\n00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.945\nthe public and the domain profiles.\n\n341\n00:20:58.945 --> 00:21:05.690\nNow by default, the public profile\nrule is here to protect you.\n\n342\n00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.702\nSo this is not one that you would\njust want to haphazardly be deleting,\n\n343\n00:21:09.702 --> 00:21:11.679\nbecause it does have a reason why.\n\n344\n00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:14.690\nSometimes if you think about\nthe logic behind it, you don't want.\n\n345\n00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.630\nA lot of times if you're on a public\nnetwork, you don't want people to\n\n346\n00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.681\nhave more open doors and you just\nkinda wanna harden that system there.\n\n347\n00:21:24.681 --> 00:21:29.758\nSo everything that we've talked about so\nfar and these different rules that have\n\n348\n00:21:29.758 --> 00:21:35.296\nbeen enabled by default, we've been\ntalking about Server 2012 and 2012 R2.\n\n349\n00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:40.531\nWhat happens when you have an environment,\na mixed environment when you have older\n\n350\n00:21:40.531 --> 00:21:45.715\nsystems, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2,\nmaybe even Server 2003.\n\n351\n00:21:45.715 --> 00:21:49.695\nI don't know, but\nit's not going to be as easy for us.\n\n352\n00:21:49.695 --> 00:21:54.523\nThere are a couple different steps that we\nhave to go through just to make sure that\n\n353\n00:21:54.523 --> 00:21:58.861\nwe can setup remote management,\nbecause it's not enabled by default.\n\n354\n00:21:58.861 --> 00:22:00.055\nSo, let me pull-up a diagram.\n\n355\n00:22:00.055 --> 00:22:03.531\nI have a couple diagrams here.\n\n356\n00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:06.168\nThese are just those rules\nthat we had spoke about,\n\n357\n00:22:06.168 --> 00:22:08.261\ntalking about the decommon amenities.\n\n358\n00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:12.673\nSo I don't know if you wanna screenshot\nthat or save it for your notes, but\n\n359\n00:22:12.673 --> 00:22:16.675\nthose were the four associated with\nDCOM just to be familiar with.\n\n360\n00:22:16.675 --> 00:22:19.721\nBut when we talk about\ndown-level server management,\n\n361\n00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:21.544\nsome things need to happen here.\n\n362\n00:22:21.544 --> 00:22:28.401\nSo number one, you have to have\n.NET Framework version 4.5.\n\n363\n00:22:28.401 --> 00:22:30.678\nAt the time of this recording,\n\n364\n00:22:30.678 --> 00:22:35.064\nthat's the most current version\nas well as WMF version 4.\n\n365\n00:22:35.064 --> 00:22:37.422\nSo, Windows Management Framework\nversion 4.\n\n366\n00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:40.196\nSo for those older systems,\n\n367\n00:22:40.196 --> 00:22:45.753\nyou will need to download those two and\nI'm pretty sure.\n\n368\n00:22:45.753 --> 00:22:48.141\nLet's see.\n\n369\n00:22:48.141 --> 00:22:50.865\nThis is a great TechNet page.\n\n370\n00:22:50.865 --> 00:22:54.584\nI put this in the show notes.\n\n371\n00:22:54.584 --> 00:22:57.220\nAnd actually, let's just take a look\nhere since we are right here.\n\n372\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.189\nIt has a lot of hyperlinks to all of\nthe tools that you need to go ahead and\n\n373\n00:23:02.189 --> 00:23:04.305\nconfigure a lot of settings.\n\n374\n00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:05.218\nWhat is the name of this page?\n\n375\n00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:09.672\nSo, it is actually Configure Remote\nManagement In Server Manager.\n\n376\n00:23:09.672 --> 00:23:14.337\nHere is that .NET Framework and\nthe WMF Framework links.\n\n377\n00:23:14.337 --> 00:23:21.223\nSo definitely, check this out and\njust click on that hyperlink there.\n\n378\n00:23:21.223 --> 00:23:24.936\nAs always, when you're grabbing\nthese downloads, goodness.\n\n379\n00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.706\nIt's taking a little bit here.\n\n380\n00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:28.588\nBut I just wanted to show you that,\nthat's where you would get it.\n\n381\n00:23:28.588 --> 00:23:33.497\nSo, here's the download page and just like\nwith other things I've mentioned to you.\n\n382\n00:23:33.497 --> 00:23:37.712\nYou always want to read\nthose release notes.\n\n383\n00:23:37.712 --> 00:23:46.059\nSometimes, it doesn't always work\nwith all the different environments.\n\n384\n00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:50.252\nLet me see if there is anything\nspecific here that is kind of glaring.\n\n385\n00:23:50.252 --> 00:23:54.944\nI know like I said, sometimes if you\nare using older versions system centers,\n\n386\n00:23:54.944 --> 00:23:58.939\nsomething it may be Something that\nyou wanna just check out first.\n\n387\n00:23:58.939 --> 00:24:03.270\nThere are older versions of .NET Framework\navailable if you are working on really old\n\n388\n00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:03.822\nsystems.\n\n389\n00:24:03.822 --> 00:24:07.869\nBut hopefully, you can kind of move\nforward and migrate from that,\n\n390\n00:24:07.869 --> 00:24:09.150\nif that's the case.\n\n391\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.880\nI'm just hitting the back button here, so\nwe can look at the different things that\n\n392\n00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.000\nare in this link,\nbecause there is just a ton.\n\n393\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.016\nTalking about enabling\nthe remote management,\n\n394\n00:24:18.016 --> 00:24:22.659\nyou can even see it goes into that DCOM\nhere for those remote instructions.\n\n395\n00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:26.051\nNow this is kind of cool, because if you\nthink about everything that we've covered\n\n396\n00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:27.417\nand that you've learned so far.\n\n397\n00:24:27.417 --> 00:24:31.195\nWe've looked at how to enable\nServer Manager with Remote using\n\n398\n00:24:31.195 --> 00:24:33.124\nthe Graphical User Interface.\n\n399\n00:24:33.124 --> 00:24:35.412\nUsing PowerShell, using the command line.\n\n400\n00:24:35.412 --> 00:24:37.405\nWe haven't got to group policy yet, but\n\n401\n00:24:37.405 --> 00:24:40.635\nthat's gonna be an entire section\nof the exam that we'll cover.\n\n402\n00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:44.548\nSo this a really great link, and,\nof course, if you can't find it,\n\n403\n00:24:44.548 --> 00:24:46.108\nI showed you the name of it.\n\n404\n00:24:46.108 --> 00:24:49.834\nIf the URL moved, or something,\nfrom the time of the recording.\n\n405\n00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:54.855\nYep, and we've done all that,\ntaking a look at configure\n\n406\n00:24:54.855 --> 00:24:59.171\nsmremoding here in PowerShell,\nso pretty cool.\n\n407\n00:24:59.171 --> 00:25:02.534\nAll right, so we've got those two things.\n\n408\n00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:06.928\nWe've downloaded our .NET\nFramework Version 4.5,\n\n409\n00:25:06.928 --> 00:25:11.424\nwe've got our\nWindows Management Framework Version 4.\n\n410\n00:25:11.424 --> 00:25:16.800\nWe need to make sure that our\nWindows remote management,\n\n411\n00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.269\nHTTP inbound is enabled.\n\n412\n00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:20.654\nAnd that's what we were\njust looking at there.\n\n413\n00:25:20.654 --> 00:25:24.153\nWith that command that we were\njust using to go ahead and\n\n414\n00:25:24.153 --> 00:25:28.046\nfilter out that specific rule,\nso that's the third thing.\n\n415\n00:25:28.046 --> 00:25:34.020\nAnd then we also need to enable additional\nrules when we were using netsh.\n\n416\n00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.143\nIf we're gonna be using the DCOM there,\n\n417\n00:25:36.143 --> 00:25:38.771\nthen that's definitely\nsomething to consider.\n\n418\n00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:43.407\nAnd we also need to create a Listener,\nand we showed you how to do that,\n\n419\n00:25:43.407 --> 00:25:47.748\nit's an automated process with\nthe WinRM quickconfig utility.\n\n420\n00:25:47.748 --> 00:25:50.255\nAnd if you haven't checked that out,\nthen definitely go back and\n\n421\n00:25:50.255 --> 00:25:51.266\ncheck out the other show.\n\n422\n00:25:51.266 --> 00:25:52.459\nBecause we did create,\n\n423\n00:25:52.459 --> 00:25:56.530\nthe operating system created it for us\nby taking advantage of that quickconfig.\n\n424\n00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.543\nSo really just a couple extra things,\nyou want to check and\n\n425\n00:25:59.543 --> 00:26:01.339\nmake sure all of that is good to go.\n\n426\n00:26:01.339 --> 00:26:03.574\nAnd then everything should be working for\nyou.\n\n427\n00:26:03.574 --> 00:26:07.101\nBut what if we're dealing with\nsystems that don't have graphical user\n\n428\n00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:08.225\ninterfaces, right?\n\n429\n00:26:08.225 --> 00:26:09.999\nAnd we're just dealing with Server Core,\n\n430\n00:26:09.999 --> 00:26:12.226\nthat's definitely something\nto consider because.\n\n431\n00:26:12.226 --> 00:26:18.709\nHold on, it looks like I have to\nclear that screen out a little bit.\n\n432\n00:26:18.709 --> 00:26:26.613\nThis is a very popular way that we're\ngoing with the smaller footprints here.\n\n433\n00:26:26.613 --> 00:26:31.320\nUtilize and save on resources, and\nlet me just clear that screen.\n\n434\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:38.475\nSo this is just Server 2012 R2 Data\nCenter Edition, Core Edition, right?\n\n435\n00:26:38.475 --> 00:26:43.144\nAnd now when we talk about remote\nmanagement of core operating systems.\n\n436\n00:26:43.144 --> 00:26:47.819\nIt really isn't that different from\nactually managing a server with\n\n437\n00:26:47.819 --> 00:26:49.840\na graphical user interface.\n\n438\n00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.673\nSo, I just want to point out a few things\nhere, let me make this font a little bit\n\n439\n00:26:54.673 --> 00:26:58.133\nlarger, as well, so\nwe can see what we're doing here.\n\n440\n00:26:58.133 --> 00:27:00.652\nOops, I'm in the wrong section.\n\n441\n00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:11.890\nLet's try 24, and we'll make it white,\n\n442\n00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:16.626\nalso, to help with my vision, all right,\n\n443\n00:27:16.626 --> 00:27:19.794\nthat's pretty big, okay.\n\n444\n00:27:19.794 --> 00:27:20.637\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n445\n00:27:20.637 --> 00:27:22.077\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to get it on there.\n\n446\n00:27:22.077 --> 00:27:30.682\nOkay, so the first thing I want to\nnote is I'm currently in PowerShell.\n\n447\n00:27:30.682 --> 00:27:35.032\nSo, by default, it'll just come up\nwith the Shell as the command prompt.\n\n448\n00:27:35.032 --> 00:27:37.673\nAll you have to do is\ntype in PowerShell and\n\n449\n00:27:37.673 --> 00:27:40.849\nyou'll see that's why I\nhave my little PS there.\n\n450\n00:27:40.849 --> 00:27:42.192\nNow, remember,\n\n451\n00:27:42.192 --> 00:27:47.572\nwe can take advantage of that WinRM\nutility also inside of PowerShell.\n\n452\n00:27:47.572 --> 00:27:52.525\nSo let me go ahead and type in winrm,\n\n453\n00:27:52.525 --> 00:27:55.672\nget, space, winrm.\n\n454\n00:27:55.672 --> 00:27:57.810\nAnd this should be familiar to you,\n\n455\n00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.247\nbecause we've already used\nour config utility before.\n\n456\n00:28:01.247 --> 00:28:06.926\nBut notice we didn't get an error like\nwe had previously in the previous show,\n\n457\n00:28:06.926 --> 00:28:09.087\nbecause it wasn't enabled.\n\n458\n00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:12.882\nThat's because I wanted to show\nyou guys that, but remember,\n\n459\n00:28:12.882 --> 00:28:16.907\nby default, it is enabled\nwith Server 2012 and 2012 R2.\n\n460\n00:28:16.907 --> 00:28:20.525\nAnd you can see just the different\nports that we're using here,\n\n461\n00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:24.956\nand all the different information,\nthe different types of authentication.\n\n462\n00:28:24.956 --> 00:28:27.543\nKerberos, a negotiate\nthat we're using here\n\n463\n00:28:27.543 --> 00:28:29.941\nwithin an Active Directory environment.\n\n464\n00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:33.477\nWe do have abilities to utilize\nother types of authentication for\n\n465\n00:28:33.477 --> 00:28:34.708\nthis communication.\n\n466\n00:28:34.708 --> 00:28:41.583\nBut see, we can look at our HTTP and our\nHTTPS port numbers here, 5985 and 5986.\n\n467\n00:28:41.583 --> 00:28:44.822\nRemember, we're not using\nthose default port numbers.\n\n468\n00:28:44.822 --> 00:28:48.560\nSo just be aware of that,\nit is enabled on this machine.\n\n469\n00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.995\nAnd, as a matter of fact,\nthere's also cmdlt, let me clear that out,\n\n470\n00:28:51.995 --> 00:28:53.217\nthat I do wanna show you.\n\n471\n00:28:53.217 --> 00:28:54.893\nIf you wanted to check for the listener,\n\n472\n00:28:54.893 --> 00:28:57.076\nif you had a reason to\ncreate additional listeners.\n\n473\n00:28:57.076 --> 00:29:03.639\nThe cmdlt is going to be winrm,\nspace, enumerate.\n\n474\n00:29:05.811 --> 00:29:09.611\nAnd we're gonna enumerate winrm, no space,\n\n475\n00:29:09.611 --> 00:29:14.295\njust forward slash,\nforward slash config/listener.\n\n476\n00:29:20.127 --> 00:29:22.634\nAll right, so it kind of narrows\ndown that information that we\n\n477\n00:29:22.634 --> 00:29:24.673\nhad just seen to focus\nreally in on that listener.\n\n478\n00:29:24.673 --> 00:29:30.868\nAnd if you did have additional listeners,\nwhich will be your wsman listeners there.\n\n479\n00:29:30.868 --> 00:29:33.973\nThose are the types of communications that\nwe're listening for across our network,\n\n480\n00:29:33.973 --> 00:29:35.406\nI just wanted to point that out for you.\n\n481\n00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:40.108\nI'm trying to think,\nwhat else do we have left?\n\n482\n00:29:40.108 --> 00:29:47.757\nYou always wanna make sure here with your\nCore that you have PSRemoting enabled.\n\n483\n00:29:47.757 --> 00:29:51.050\nSo that we can use PowerShell\ncommands to this Core machine,\n\n484\n00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:53.513\nso, let's definitely make sure we enable.\n\n485\n00:29:53.513 --> 00:29:55.536\nThis is going to be Enable-PSRemoting,\n\n486\n00:29:55.536 --> 00:29:58.555\nlike you guys have already seen\nthis before, we've done it.\n\n487\n00:29:58.555 --> 00:30:03.646\nAll right, so we've enabled PSRemoting,\nwe'll hit A for the yes to all there.\n\n488\n00:30:03.646 --> 00:30:06.436\nI'm kind of hanging off the screen here,\nall right.\n\n489\n00:30:06.436 --> 00:30:10.392\nAnd it says, hey, look,\nit's already set up, you're good to go,\n\n490\n00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:15.057\nwhich is perfect, and we'll just need to\nfinish through the yes to all's here.\n\n491\n00:30:15.057 --> 00:30:19.994\nNow, I do wanna show you\none other tool that you do\n\n492\n00:30:19.994 --> 00:30:24.820\nhave at your disposal\nhere within Server Core.\n\n493\n00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.845\nAll right, let me clear that off again.\n\n494\n00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:36.526\nAll right, this is going to be S config.\n\n495\n00:30:36.526 --> 00:30:40.719\nRemember we saw S config when we\nwere talking about how to set up and\n\n496\n00:30:40.719 --> 00:30:42.329\nconfigure Server Core.\n\n497\n00:30:42.329 --> 00:30:45.633\nBut I just wanted to note\nthat there are a couple\n\n498\n00:30:45.633 --> 00:30:49.713\noptions that are right into\nthis menu driven interface.\n\n499\n00:30:49.713 --> 00:30:53.198\nSo, number 4 here is\nConfigure Remote Management, so\n\n500\n00:30:53.198 --> 00:30:57.960\nit is enabled, that's a plus if you\nwant to connect to it remotely, right?\n\n501\n00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.636\nNow notice how, which I don't even\nknow if I've mentioned this, but\n\n502\n00:31:02.636 --> 00:31:06.134\nby default,\nRemote Desktop is actually disabled.\n\n503\n00:31:06.134 --> 00:31:07.268\nSo this is, like I said,\n\n504\n00:31:07.268 --> 00:31:10.077\nthis is the way that they want\nyou to use the operating system.\n\n505\n00:31:10.077 --> 00:31:13.464\nAnd not utilizing that full blown RPC and\n\n506\n00:31:13.464 --> 00:31:19.452\nremoting in with Remote Desktop there,\nby default, it's disabled.\n\n507\n00:31:19.452 --> 00:31:23.880\nSo I just wanted to make sure that you\nguys were remembering S config as well,\n\n508\n00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.757\nit's definitely a great tool.\n\n509\n00:31:25.757 --> 00:31:29.448\nAnd then, lastly,\nlet me hop back on over to, so\n\n510\n00:31:29.448 --> 00:31:35.501\nI wouldn't really in real life be using\na domain controller to manage servers.\n\n511\n00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:39.174\nMaybe a workstation, or something,\nbut just let me pull that up anyways.\n\n512\n00:31:39.174 --> 00:31:46.057\nRight here, I also have the ability\nto utilize Server Manager with,\n\n513\n00:31:46.057 --> 00:31:49.627\nif I can get my cursor, there it is.\n\n514\n00:31:49.627 --> 00:31:54.979\nI can use Server Manager to\nmanage that Core edition as well.\n\n515\n00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:55.873\n&gt;&gt; You have to type in the box.\n\n516\n00:31:55.873 --> 00:31:59.108\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would help, wouldn't it?\n\n517\n00:31:59.108 --> 00:31:59.873\nAll right.\n\n518\n00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.631\nJust give it a second,\nit's pulling it up here.\n\n519\n00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:14.414\nAll right, so\nif I wanted to go to All Servers,\n\n520\n00:32:14.414 --> 00:32:17.329\nand then we'll add that server in.\n\n521\n00:32:24.764 --> 00:32:28.273\nSo under Manage on the right hand side,\nwe'll select Add Servers.\n\n522\n00:32:31.548 --> 00:32:38.610\nNow, I'm gonna type in the name of that\nmachine is core01 and we'll hit Find Now.\n\n523\n00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.200\nAnd remember,\na couple different ways you could do that,\n\n524\n00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.500\nit uses DNS or\nActive Directory if you're utilizing that.\n\n525\n00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:51.830\nBut it came in, it found it very easily,\nso we'll just left click and right click.\n\n526\n00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.380\nAdd that to our pool, Server Pool here.\n\n527\n00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.181\nWe'll hit OK.\n\n528\n00:32:57.059 --> 00:32:59.720\nSo it's just pulling the information\nin for that machine.\n\n529\n00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:08.310\nWe'll go ahead and right-click and if we\nhad enabled Remote Desktop Connection,\n\n530\n00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.730\nthen we could take advantage of that\nhere but it's kind of silly to do so,\n\n531\n00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:15.070\nbecause if you think about it,\nit's just that shell, just that CLI.\n\n532\n00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:19.590\nSo we can pull up those same\ntools here on this system.\n\n533\n00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.190\nYou can access Add Rules and Features.\n\n534\n00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.170\nSo if I wanted to go through\na graphical user interface, so\n\n535\n00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:28.040\nif you think about it, it's kinda strange\nbecause we don't have that graphical user\n\n536\n00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.990\ninterface on the actual server but\nwe have it here for management purposes.\n\n537\n00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:37.370\nSo we can save resources\non our physical boxes and\n\n538\n00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.510\nhave more servers running in\na virtualized environment and\n\n539\n00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.440\nmanage it from a graphical\nuser interface here.\n\n540\n00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.950\nIt's really smart, if you ask me.\n\n541\n00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.460\nWe'll just cancel out of there but\nI do wanna show you one other thing.\n\n542\n00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:54.070\nSo on that particular core server, I had\nalready enabled those DCOM firewall rules.\n\n543\n00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.098\nBecause if not,\nthis is where you would have the problem.\n\n544\n00:33:58.098 --> 00:34:00.447\nI shouldn't get the error, I say not but\n\n545\n00:34:00.447 --> 00:34:04.402\nI shouldn't get the error when I\nselect Computer Management here.\n\n546\n00:34:04.402 --> 00:34:09.880\nIf I hadn't set those firewall rules,\nthen I would see an error here.\n\n547\n00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.600\nThat's where it would kind\nof just fall out on you.\n\n548\n00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.853\nBut that's why I wanted to take that\ntime and show you where to go ahead and\n\n549\n00:34:17.853 --> 00:34:19.828\nmake sure they're all enabled.\n\n550\n00:34:19.828 --> 00:34:24.448\nSo just right-clicking and you have the\nability to connect to another computer but\n\n551\n00:34:24.448 --> 00:34:27.880\nI'm already there at the right\ncomputer that I wanna manage,\n\n552\n00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.052\nlooking at my different system tools,\ntask scheduler.\n\n553\n00:34:31.052 --> 00:34:37.556\nCould go ahead and run a script\nhere remotely for that server core.\n\n554\n00:34:37.556 --> 00:34:41.606\nSo really, it's not too different from\nhow you would manage a graphical user\n\n555\n00:34:41.606 --> 00:34:45.654\ninterface, just making sure that you have\nit set up initially the right way is\n\n556\n00:34:45.654 --> 00:34:47.790\nwhat we really wanna make sure of there.\n\n557\n00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.900\nI think that's about it.\n\n558\n00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.330\nThere are a couple other different, I\nknow, you probably never thought you could\n\n559\n00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.995\ntalk this much about remote management but\nthere are just a couple more things that I\n\n560\n00:34:57.995 --> 00:35:01.110\nwanna come back and talk to you about when\nwe're dealing with remote management.\n\n561\n00:35:02.372 --> 00:35:05.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, well,\nthank you again for helping us to take\n\n562\n00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.180\na look at those different technologies\ndealing with remote management.\n\n563\n00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.610\nThere's a lot for you to consider as\nyou get prepared for the 70-410 exam.\n\n564\n00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.480\nMake sure you take a look\nat these firewall rules.\n\n565\n00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.670\nMake sure you understand some of the\ndifferent aspects and different ways that\n\n566\n00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.920\nyou can use remote management but\nthat's gonna end it for this episode then.\n\n567\n00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.820\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n568\n00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n569\n00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.135\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n570\n00:35:31.135 --> 00:35:37.855\n[MUSIC]\n\n571\n00:35:37.855 -->

00:00:16.697\nWelcome back to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:19.005\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.324\nwe're continuing through\nour series in 74-10.\n\n9\n00:00:21.324 --> 00:00:23.944\nThat's right, the MCSA and\nWindows server 2012 and\n\n10\n00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:27.232\njoining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mrs. Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:27.972\nHow are you doing today, Cherokee?\n\n12\n00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:28.933\n&gt;&gt; Good Wes, how are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:33.506\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm doing great, and recently\nwe've seen in blogs, in news feeds,\n\n14\n00:00:33.506 --> 00:00:36.591\nI've heard a lot about\nthis term virtualization.\n\n15\n00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:39.550\nSo it definitely seems to be\nan industry buzzword if you will.\n\n16\n00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.596\nCan you help me out?\n\n17\n00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:43.643\nWhat's so great about virtualization and\nreally, what is it?\n\n18\n00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:46.310\n&gt;&gt; So, virtualization is something\nthat's been around for a while.\n\n19\n00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.830\nA matter of fact, there were\nprojects seeking started by MIT and\n\n20\n00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.200\ndifferent organizations as early\nas the 1960s, the late 60s.\n\n21\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.490\nSo it wasn't until IBM really brought\nit out into the commercial use,\n\n22\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.330\nbut we see this all over the place,\nespecially in cloud computing,\n\n23\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.320\nit's such a common thing nowadays.\n\n24\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.460\nSo it's kind of a strange concept, Wes.\n\n25\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.850\nIt's taking something that's really not\nthere and we're creating a machine.\n\n26\n00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.720\nWe can interact with it and\nwork with it just like we would.\n\n27\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.370\nSo if we had a physical machine,\n\n28\n00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.340\nwe can allocate those physical\nresources to our virtual machines.\n\n29\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.249\nThings like our network interface cards,\nwe can go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.403\ncreate virtualized switches for\nour machines.\n\n31\n00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:33.875\nWe can take disk space and\nactually create different ISO images and\n\n32\n00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:40.100\nhave those VHD and VHDX files\nrunning as operating systems there.\n\n33\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.220\nMemory's kind of different.\n\n34\n00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.350\nMemory is memory.\n\n35\n00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.070\nWe can't kind of fudge those numbers\nthere with our virtual environments.\n\n36\n00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.680\nThey really do love to use that memory so\nwe'll talk about\n\n37\n00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.760\nthat a little later as well because a\nvirtualization has come a really long way.\n\n38\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.985\nAnd it's not what it use to\nbe with just virtual PC or\n\n39\n00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:02.140\nwhat were some of the earlier\nimplementations, Microsoft Virtual Server.\n\n40\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.440\nWe actually see some pretty cool\nimprovements over the years in Server\n\n41\n00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.960\n2012, and 2012 R2 definitely bring\nthat to table here with Hyper-V.\n\n42\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.636\nSo let's take a look here at my screen.\n\n43\n00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:19.860\nOn TechNet, we see, as Microsoft usually\ndoes, has some really great documentation\n\n44\n00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.130\non how we can go ahead and install\nHyper-V and create a virtual machine.\n\n45\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.746\nSo aside from your normal prerequisites\nthat we've already talked about for\n\n46\n00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:33.290\njust having the 2012 and\n2012 R2 operating system, there are a few\n\n47\n00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.854\nother considerations that we'd like to\njust kind of keep in mind, as well.\n\n48\n00:02:37.854 --> 00:02:40.762\nSo let's go ahead and\nclick on this link here.\n\n49\n00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:44.957\nSo you can see a couple of steps, just to\nget a machine installed, prep the system\n\n50\n00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:48.801\nto run Hyper-V, bringing up machines and\nwe'll talk about all of that.\n\n51\n00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.568\nBut let's just click on this\noption here to install Hyper-V.\n\n52\n00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:56.552\nAnd I mean, we can see here we've\ngot some prerequisites noted.\n\n53\n00:02:56.552 --> 00:03:03.253\nWe'll cover those as well and just\na really good step by step guide here.\n\n54\n00:03:03.253 --> 00:03:08.232\nAnd again we are gonna be really focusing\non the Hyper-V role in Server 2012 or\n\n55\n00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:09.180\n2012 R2.\n\n56\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.038\nThere are different deployment options and\nwe'll get to those in a little bit but\n\n57\n00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:16.622\nyou can even see here there's a Hyper-V.\n\n58\n00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:20.219\nIt's called Client Hyper-V\nthat we can even use if I\n\n59\n00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.110\ncan get my clicker working here.\n\n60\n00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.730\nWe can use on the client side\noperating systems, all right.\n\n61\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.600\nSo we can actually run Hyper-V right\nfrom a client operating system.\n\n62\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.021\nPretty easy to go ahead and\ndo that and just enable it.\n\n63\n00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.031\nJust remember that this\nis an optional role, so\n\n64\n00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:41.195\nif you're using any kind\nof deployment options or\n\n65\n00:03:41.195 --> 00:03:46.111\nworking in a controlled environment you\nmay not have that option available.\n\n66\n00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:49.430\nBut it's always a possibility to go\nahead and get that up and running.\n\n67\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.459\n&gt;&gt; Speaking of availability\nthere Cherokee,\n\n68\n00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.015\none of the things that I think of is if\nwe can run client side Hyper-V, right,\n\n69\n00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:58.493\nI've had to install things like .NET\nFramework for different programs.\n\n70\n00:03:58.493 --> 00:04:01.570\nSo I've had to go into that program and\nfeature role and turn on things like that.\n\n71\n00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.720\nIf I can go into programs and features and\n\n72\n00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.310\nI can turn on Client Hyper-V,\nwhy wouldn't I just run Client Hyper-V?\n\n73\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.130\nWhy would I go through the process of\ninstalling the role on a server product,\n\n74\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.960\nand then bringing that online?\n\n75\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.620\nJust go ahead and stay with the client.\n\n76\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.380\n&gt;&gt; That's a really great question, Wes,\n\n77\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.225\nbecause if we think about the logic\nbehind that, you're like, hey.\n\n78\n00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.990\nClient operating systems, the licensing's\ncheaper, I don't need as much hardware, so\n\n79\n00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.210\nwhy not right?\n\n80\n00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.116\nWell there are some limitations to\nclient-side Hyper-V or Client Hyper-V, so\n\n81\n00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:29.510\nlet's take a look at those.\n\n82\n00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.893\nI have that folder up here, if you will.\n\n83\n00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:34.773\nSo just a few things, I won't bore\nyou with all of these details.\n\n84\n00:04:34.773 --> 00:04:39.592\nWe will talk about some of them more in\ndepth and some of them you'll see in later\n\n85\n00:04:39.592 --> 00:04:43.917\nshows if you're gonna continue for\nyou MCSA here in Server 2012.\n\n86\n00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:47.682\nWe'll cover Remote FX, it's just where\nwe're actually utilizing graphical\n\n87\n00:04:47.682 --> 00:04:49.380\nprocessing units instead of CPUs.\n\n88\n00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.060\nSo some advanced features that\noptimize systems are not supported,\n\n89\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.970\nsuch as live migration, Hyper-V replica,\ndifferent other options as well.\n\n90\n00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.730\nIt's not that you can't run\nHyper-V on a client side system,\n\n91\n00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.420\nits just that in a production environment,\n\n92\n00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.890\nit would be more beneficial to go ahead\nand get the full-fledged operating system.\n\n93\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.960\nBut for classroom environment,\nwe use a lot of demonstration and\n\n94\n00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.310\nlab environments here.\n\n95\n00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.430\nIt would work just fine for that.\n\n96\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.130\nAnd again, they do note some other\nlimitations for the Hyper-V client here.\n\n97\n00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.750\nLet me just roll over.\n\n98\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.390\nSome hardware components,\nsuch as utilizing Windows BitLocker which\n\n99\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.290\nactually relies on Hyper components such\nas that TPM, Trusted Platform Module.\n\n100\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.170\nIt says here that they may not work\nproperly within that virtual machine and\n\n101\n00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.700\njust different applications\nthat require processing with\n\n102\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.990\nthe graphical processing units.\n\n103\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.872\nSo it just depends.\n\n104\n00:05:47.872 --> 00:05:52.345\nYou really have to, again just like with\nany, deployment you should always test and\n\n105\n00:05:52.345 --> 00:05:55.380\nmake sure that it works\nwithin your system first.\n\n106\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.580\n&gt;&gt; So if I'm in the test environment,\nthis is perfect.\n\n107\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.250\nIf I just need a quick test bed,\nI need to work with maybe an application,\n\n108\n00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.810\nmaybe a virtual machine,\nClient Hyper-V's where I wanna go.\n\n109\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.746\nBut if I want to go into\na production environment,\n\n110\n00:06:06.746 --> 00:06:09.062\nprobably should steer away\nfrom Client Hyper-V, right?\n\n111\n00:06:09.062 --> 00:06:09.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n112\n00:06:09.823 --> 00:06:10.430\n&gt;&gt; Got you.\n\n113\n00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.165\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nalso there's a note here.\n\n114\n00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:14.816\nIt says, I just want to point that out,\nsince we're right here,\n\n115\n00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:17.700\nit says do not run a virus\nscanner in the virtual machine.\n\n116\n00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.280\nFor an optimal experience use\nSystem Center 2012 Endpoint Protection.\n\n117\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.650\nSo there's a little bit with that and\nthey're saying that System Center\n\n118\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.280\n2012 Endpoint Protection\navoids Hyper-V specific files.\n\n119\n00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.500\nAnd they are not necessarily saying hey,\nlet's abandon the idea of security here.\n\n120\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.420\nBut I think it's more important\nto note that we should\n\n121\n00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.126\npick a configuration and choose it.\n\n122\n00:06:44.126 --> 00:06:48.724\nNow, of course, with System Center\ndeploying our endpoint here,\n\n123\n00:06:48.724 --> 00:06:52.676\nit's more controlled and\nwe can really plan and stick to,\n\n124\n00:06:52.676 --> 00:06:55.434\nadhere to our security policy that way.\n\n125\n00:06:55.434 --> 00:06:57.682\nBut you just have to think\nabout how you set that up.\n\n126\n00:06:57.682 --> 00:07:01.240\nWe're gonna be talking about different\nstorage options here within our virtual\n\n127\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.310\nmachines.\n\n128\n00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.700\nAnd there's something\ncalled a pass through disk.\n\n129\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.770\nA pass through disk will enable the host\noperating system to even see the contents.\n\n130\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.010\nSo the host, the operating system,\n\n131\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:19.280\nthe guest VM has access to the physical\nhardware of the host operating system.\n\n132\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.090\nSo it's kind of strange\nif you think about that.\n\n133\n00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.410\nAnd if you don't understand, that's okay.\n\n134\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.563\nWe'll cover this a little bit more,\n\n135\n00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:27.902\nbut you don't want any kind\nof contention on that drive.\n\n136\n00:07:27.902 --> 00:07:33.475\nSo you wouldn't want to run any active\nscans, any malware scans on your VHD or\n\n137\n00:07:33.475 --> 00:07:37.422\nVHDX files because it wouldn't\nreally be scanning for\n\n138\n00:07:37.422 --> 00:07:41.670\nthat anyways,\nunless you were using a pass through disk.\n\n139\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.238\nAnd then that's kind of silly, because\nyou'd be running into malware that's\n\n140\n00:07:45.238 --> 00:07:47.378\ncontending with\nthe anti-malware on your VM.\n\n141\n00:07:47.378 --> 00:07:49.943\nIf that doesn't make sense, that's okay.\n\n142\n00:07:49.943 --> 00:07:53.860\nThat was just a side note, but something\nto consider moving forward there.\n\n143\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.060\n&gt;&gt; So security is important.\n\n144\n00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.838\nNot saying, and they're not saying\nby any means, just abandon,\n\n145\n00:07:57.838 --> 00:07:58.984\nall out abandon security.\n\n146\n00:07:58.984 --> 00:08:01.373\nVirtual machines need to be secure,\njust like our physical machines.\n\n147\n00:08:01.373 --> 00:08:03.123\nBut you have to be selective\nin what you put on there.\n\n148\n00:08:03.123 --> 00:08:04.566\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just have to pay\nattention to what you're doing, yeah.\n\n149\n00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:05.619\n&gt;&gt; Okay, absolutely.\n\n150\n00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:10.126\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like there's no sense to have\ntwo scans running and counteracting each\n\n151\n00:08:10.126 --> 00:08:14.190\nother and slowing that system down and\npotentially causing issues.\n\n152\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.800\nSo yeah, that's all, all right so\nwhat else do we gotta look at here?\n\n153\n00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:22.175\nSo we looked at the client side Hyper-V,\n\n154\n00:08:22.175 --> 00:08:25.855\nlet's take a look at some Hyper-V\ninstallation requirements.\n\n155\n00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:29.785\nSo we've already talked about\ninstalling Server 2012 and 2012 R2 and\n\n156\n00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:35.005\nthe different requirements that you\nmust have to get that up and running.\n\n157\n00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:39.035\nBut Hyper-V does require\nspecific sets of hardware.\n\n158\n00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:43.205\nSo virtualization in general,\nI've already mentioned that memory,\n\n159\n00:08:43.205 --> 00:08:49.080\nyou know memory is something, and\nwe'll get into that a little bit later for\n\n160\n00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.930\nlike the virtual machines,\nwhat the requirements are,\n\n161\n00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.400\nbut it's best practice to go ahead and\nmax that machine out now.\n\n162\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.990\nAnd we'll also look at scalability here.\n\n163\n00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.280\nAnd I think it's like four\nterabytes theoretically\n\n164\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.510\nworth of memory that your host,\nyour machine running Hyper-V can utilize.\n\n165\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.690\nAnd so that means the software\ncan actually use and\n\n166\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.500\nfunction up to four terabytes.\n\n167\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.820\nBut I don't know Wes, have you ever seen\na machine that has four terabytes of RAM?\n\n168\n00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.220\n&gt;&gt; No, I certainly haven't even some\nof the bigger machines that I've seen.\n\n169\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.410\nMaybe I could say probably for\nanother course, but\n\n170\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.320\nclustering might be the to the point.\n\n171\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.020\nBut outside of a cluster never.\n\n172\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.805\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah,\n\n173\n00:09:28.805 --> 00:09:31.932\nwe see hardware probably\nbeing a limitation here.\n\n174\n00:09:31.932 --> 00:09:34.900\nAnd so\nwe need to have an X64 based processor,\n\n175\n00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.911\nwhich you're probably already\nrunning because we're talking\n\n176\n00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:43.390\na a 64-bit architecture here\nwith Server 2012 and later.\n\n177\n00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.370\nWhat else is something?\n\n178\n00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.080\nVirtualization.\n\n179\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.680\nAs far as processor, again,\nyou would probably need to take a look and\n\n180\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.550\nmake sure that your processor\ndoes support virtualization.\n\n181\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.535\nSo Intel's variance, that's going to\nbe Intel VT with AMD, it's just AMDV.\n\n182\n00:09:58.535 --> 00:10:00.783\nAnd if you're not really sure,\n\n183\n00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:05.470\nmost processors nowadays will go ahead and\nsupport that.\n\n184\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:06.950\nI wanna say like i5 and\n\n185\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.720\nabove but you can always check\nthe manufacturer's documentation there.\n\n186\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.610\n&gt;&gt; What about the BIOS, the UEFI,\n\n187\n00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.790\nis that something that you\nalso have to have supported?\n\n188\n00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.620\nI mean,\nif it's built into the CPU architecture,\n\n189\n00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.250\ndoes the system at the lowest level, does\nit have to support it as well, Cherokee?\n\n190\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.230\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, Wes, and that's also\nsomething you'd wanna check to make sure\n\n191\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.260\nthat your motherboard was gonna go\nahead and support that as well.\n\n192\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.250\nAlso hardware and forest,\n\n193\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.110\ndata execution prevention,\nDEP must be available and enabled.\n\n194\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.360\nSpecifically, you must enable Intel X bit.\n\n195\n00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.840\nAnd again, that's another one of those and\nyou can see that here.\n\n196\n00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.260\nIt really depends on the vendor,\nthe naming there is.\n\n197\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:52.980\nSo data execution prevention, technology,\nXD bit for execution disabled bit for\n\n198\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.560\nIntel and then again with AMD, it's\nAMD NX, just short for no execution bit.\n\n199\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.600\nSo whatever it is they call it, just again\nverify and make sure that your hardware\n\n200\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.420\nis gonna support that virtualization,\nnot too much to check.\n\n201\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.660\nAnd if you're gonna go through all the\nwork to set up your server virtualization,\n\n202\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.990\nyou wanna make sure your hardware\ncan go ahead and support that.\n\n203\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.580\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's a great technology to have too.\n\n204\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.810\nJust because on the security level\nlike you were mentioning earlier with\n\n205\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.390\nthe antivirus,\n\n206\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.500\nto have that portion of memory that's\nquarantined off from executable code.\n\n207\n00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.660\nI can see where that's just another\nstep in that process of just trying to\n\n208\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.800\neliminate the communication between\nthe host and the guest operating systems.\n\n209\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.250\nNow, Cherokee, when we talk about\nthings like the DNA of the files,\n\n210\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.550\nyou mentioned the files earlier.\n\n211\n00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.480\nCan you tell us a little bit\nabout the types of files and\n\n212\n00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.980\na little bit about what\nwe can expect to see,\n\n213\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.950\nnot only in a production environment but\nmaybe on the exam as well?\n\n214\n00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.440\nYeah, so Wes, there are a couple different\nfile extensions that we should be aware of\n\n215\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.950\nand when you're working with them.\n\n216\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.470\nAnd you'll see, as we get through the\ndemonstrations, we'll actually be able to\n\n217\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.430\nselect different locations where\nwe can save these types of files.\n\n218\n00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.640\nBut if you take a look at my screen,\n\n219\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.780\nthere are a few that I'd like\nto introduce to you here.\n\n220\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.970\nBut again, we're gonna see them again.\n\n221\n00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.701\nThis is going to be an XML, you'll just\nsee it as the regular XML extension like\n\n222\n00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:05.801\nyou would see from any\nother configuration files.\n\n223\n00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:09.644\nIt's just going to go ahead and\ncontain the virtual machine configuration\n\n224\n00:12:09.644 --> 00:12:12.940\ninformation including all settings for\nthat for the VMs there.\n\n225\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.470\nSo you'll have an XML.\n\n226\n00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.210\nNow, we are gonna talk more in depth\nabout the differences here between\n\n227\n00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.250\na .VHD, or a VHDX,\njust different options we have there.\n\n228\n00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.660\nWe're talking about storage.\n\n229\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.080\nAnd again you have the option to go ahead\nand save them in the default location, or\n\n230\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.790\nyou could put them,\nyou know, in a different\n\n231\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.850\nhard drive if you have a faster drive,\nor whatever your reasoning may be.\n\n232\n00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.870\nBut you do have the functionality there,\nthe options, so.\n\n233\n00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.670\nAnd then there's a different\ntype of file here,\n\n234\n00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.090\na .vsv,\nwhich is kind of like a hyper fill file.\n\n235\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:49.100\nSo if that virtual machine is getting put\ninto an at rest state, like a save state.\n\n236\n00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.870\nSo those are just a few to be aware of.\n\n237\n00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.800\nAll right, what else do we got here?\n\n238\n00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:01.916\nSo we've covered the system requirements\nand let's take a look at scalability, Wes.\n\n239\n00:13:01.916 --> 00:13:06.274\nYou know, at the beginning of the show,\nyou asked about what is virtualization,\n\n240\n00:13:06.274 --> 00:13:07.780\nwhy would we use it?\n\n241\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.770\nAnd one of the really big things that\nwe're seeing today is being able\n\n242\n00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:17.670\nto take a machine, and\nlet's say I have a physical computer,\n\n243\n00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:22.490\nphysical server, but I'm only utilizing\n30% of the hardware capacity.\n\n244\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.010\nWell from a business management, or\n\n245\n00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.860\nwell I guess any kind of common sense\nperspective, it just doesn't make sense.\n\n246\n00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.765\nI mean I'm powering, I'm paying for\nthe electricity and powering.\n\n247\n00:13:30.765 --> 00:13:34.960\nI'm paying for the physical space,\nespecially rent space if I'm in Manhattan,\n\n248\n00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.800\nI have a small office.\n\n249\n00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.770\nSo what can I do with that remaining 70%,\nright?\n\n250\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.560\nSo I'm talking about being efficient and\nscalability.\n\n251\n00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.720\nSo what does that look like in terms\nof capacity and capabilities here?\n\n252\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.870\nSo if we can take a look at my\nscreen I'd like to share some\n\n253\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.810\nof that information with you.\n\n254\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:56.330\nSo now, looking at each\nindividual virtual machine.\n\n255\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.380\nI could have a total of\n64 virtual processors.\n\n256\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.480\nSo for each individual virtual machine,\nI could have up to one terabyte of memory.\n\n257\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.880\nNow keep in mind, at the time of\n\n258\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.280\nthis recording we're talking about\nServer 2012 and 2012 R2 for this show.\n\n259\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.335\nServer 2016, you'll see as you\ncontinue to progress through time.\n\n260\n00:14:16.335 --> 00:14:18.459\nThat's what we're talking about here,\n\n261\n00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:22.591\nwe usually wanna be increasing these\nnumbers and expanding that capability.\n\n262\n00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:27.040\nBut as of now, you can just see\ndifferent hardware components\n\n263\n00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.420\nthat are other emulated or\nwe'll talk about different ways, we have\n\n264\n00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.455\na couple different generations of machine\nthat I'll introduce to you as well, so\n\n265\n00:14:35.455 --> 00:14:40.660\nsnapshots kind of like checkpoints,\nif you will.\n\n266\n00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.600\nCreating different points in time,\nyou can revert back, great for\n\n267\n00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.760\ntesting environments, administration\nenvironments, all sorts of things there.\n\n268\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.840\nAnd we will, we'll talk about different\n[LAUGH] floppy drive here for\n\n269\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.910\nthose gen one machines and\nwe'll get into all that as well.\n\n270\n00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.810\nAnd again another legacy components for\n\n271\n00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:02.890\nyour com ports, it just depends\non different types of machines.\n\n272\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.590\nBut, if you're talking about the host\noperating system, the machine that's\n\n273\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.830\nactually running Hyper-V,\nlet's take a look at what that can hold.\n\n274\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.916\nWe can have up to 320 logical processors.\n\n275\n00:15:13.916 --> 00:15:17.333\nWhen it comes to virtual\nprocessors per logical processor,\n\n276\n00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.410\nthen there's no ratio\nthat's gonna be imposed.\n\n277\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.610\nAnd you'll find that a lot that\nreally it's not the software that's\n\n278\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.558\nthe bottleneck, but\nit's gonna be your hardware.\n\n279\n00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:30.580\nUp to 2,048 virtual processors, and\nagain, here's where we saw that really\n\n280\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:35.630\nmassive impressive number for the four\nterabytes of memory in that host there.\n\n281\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.318\nStorage and you can see a lot of this Wes,\nand there are really aren't any limits to\n\n282\n00:15:40.318 --> 00:15:43.670\na lot of the different access that\nyou have for storage area networks.\n\n283\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.960\nSo this is why we are seeing it.\n\n284\n00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.350\nThis is why we are seeing it all over\nbecause, and as you even mentioned and\n\n285\n00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.420\nlike failovers and\nclustering with Hyper-V.\n\n286\n00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.470\nSo in this show we don't cover it too\nmuch, but I've worked with Adam in\n\n287\n00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.590\ndifferent shows where we talk about\ndifferent implementations for failover and\n\n288\n00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.820\nclustering, which is great for\nenterprise environments.\n\n289\n00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.945\n&gt;&gt; So these numbers might seem a little\nastronomical when you look at them.\n\n290\n00:16:04.945 --> 00:16:08.367\nCuz I think four terabytes I mean one\nof the biggest machines I've seen,\n\n291\n00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:11.580\njust in a workstation let alone a server,\nwas like 96 gigs of RAM.\n\n292\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.721\nSo even though the numbers themselves seem\nlike they are way out there as you see\n\n293\n00:16:15.721 --> 00:16:18.170\nthings like private cloud and\ndata centers and\n\n294\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.123\nthem clustering these machines together,\nyou can probably hit that limit\n\n295\n00:16:22.123 --> 00:16:25.914\nfairly easily when you talk about\nbundling multiple things together.\n\n296\n00:16:25.914 --> 00:16:29.828\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, if you think about\nif you're a cloud provider and you have\n\n297\n00:16:29.828 --> 00:16:34.248\nmultiple clients and that's probably how a\nlot of you are gonna be working nowadays.\n\n298\n00:16:34.248 --> 00:16:37.084\nWe're seeing this shift,\nthis change in the field and\n\n299\n00:16:37.084 --> 00:16:38.943\nit's just becoming more popular.\n\n300\n00:16:38.943 --> 00:16:40.925\nIt's efficient, we have that elasticity.\n\n301\n00:16:40.925 --> 00:16:41.891\nWe can grow.\n\n302\n00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:45.190\nSo, virtualization is\na perfect solution for that.\n\n303\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.799\nWell, they really, you need kind of\nboth to go ahead and have that for\n\n304\n00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:51.804\nthe virtualization to have\nthat cloud infrastructure.\n\n305\n00:16:51.804 --> 00:16:53.596\nSo, it's pretty cool there.\n\n306\n00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.412\nThere are some other components.\n\n307\n00:16:56.412 --> 00:17:00.500\nAnd so if we take a look at my screen, I\nkind of have to give credit here to Adam.\n\n308\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.226\nThese are some great vocab terms,\na little in-depth and\n\n309\n00:17:04.226 --> 00:17:07.109\nI know I'm kind of working backwards here.\n\n310\n00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.142\nBut I'm giving you some information and\n\n311\n00:17:09.142 --> 00:17:12.203\nyou guys have access to this\nfile in the show notes, as well.\n\n312\n00:17:12.203 --> 00:17:15.383\nIf it doesn't make sense at first,\nyou can just hit rewind and go back and\n\n313\n00:17:15.383 --> 00:17:15.967\nwatch that.\n\n314\n00:17:15.967 --> 00:17:19.105\nBecause I'm gonna be breaking it down,\nBarney style in a few minutes.\n\n315\n00:17:19.105 --> 00:17:22.719\nSo for those of you who are familiar\nwith virtualization, that's great.\n\n316\n00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:24.705\nThese terms may help you just brush up.\n\n317\n00:17:24.705 --> 00:17:26.617\nIf you're not familiar,\nthen that's great too.\n\n318\n00:17:26.617 --> 00:17:31.160\nBecause we're kinda gonna back pedal\na little bit before we move forward.\n\n319\n00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.153\nJust looking at, again I'm not gonna\nbore you with all of these terms here.\n\n320\n00:17:35.153 --> 00:17:37.992\nConfiguration, components,\nthe ability to create, modify and\n\n321\n00:17:37.992 --> 00:17:39.981\njust basically change and\nthis term destroy.\n\n322\n00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:44.026\nSounds so invasive, but any kind of\nchanges to that external files what we're\n\n323\n00:17:44.026 --> 00:17:46.735\ntalking about for\nthis configuration components.\n\n324\n00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:47.990\nYou hypercall.\n\n325\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.881\nSo, Hyper-V uses a lot of\ndifferent special APIs and\n\n326\n00:17:52.881 --> 00:17:56.696\nservices that are specific to Hyper-V.\n\n327\n00:17:56.696 --> 00:17:59.817\nSo, these are gonna be some of those\ncomponents that you might just wanna\n\n328\n00:17:59.817 --> 00:18:01.310\nfamiliarize yourself with here.\n\n329\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.358\nVirtual machine management service.\n\n330\n00:18:05.358 --> 00:18:09.237\nThis can be implemented as a single\nexecutable in order to manage virtual\n\n331\n00:18:09.237 --> 00:18:10.240\nmachines.\n\n332\n00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.321\nSo what it does is it maintains\nthe list of virtual machines and\n\n333\n00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:15.584\nit allows you to view them,\nand see changes.\n\n334\n00:18:15.584 --> 00:18:19.681\nBut in our world, what we'll be seeing\nhere a lot of times you'll hear me say\n\n335\n00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.807\nlike VMM for virtual machine manager.\n\n336\n00:18:21.807 --> 00:18:24.358\nSo we're really talking\nabout the Hyper-V manager,\n\n337\n00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:27.686\nthat graphical interface where we can\nsee all of our machines listed and\n\n338\n00:18:27.686 --> 00:18:29.753\nnote any changes and\nthings to that nature.\n\n339\n00:18:29.753 --> 00:18:34.285\nSo just a couple different terms you\nmight want to acclimate yourself with.\n\n340\n00:18:34.285 --> 00:18:40.018\nSome of them might even be familiar\nwith you like we'll look at in a second,\n\n341\n00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:43.477\nbut this one is pretty interesting, VMBus.\n\n342\n00:18:43.477 --> 00:18:48.436\nThis is where a lot of your,\nI guess improvement comes from.\n\n343\n00:18:48.436 --> 00:18:52.006\nIn older operating systems, they really\ndidn't know how to integrate and\n\n344\n00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:53.715\nhandle well with virtualization.\n\n345\n00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:57.753\nBut now our VMBus, a high-speed\ninter-partition communication mechanism\n\n346\n00:18:57.753 --> 00:19:01.547\ndesigned to provide point-to-point\ncommunications between child and\n\n347\n00:19:01.547 --> 00:19:02.658\nparent partitions.\n\n348\n00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:07.822\nReally allows for smoother\nexperiences with in virtualization,\n\n349\n00:19:07.822 --> 00:19:12.616\nbecause the operating systems\nare able to utilize the VMBus in\n\n350\n00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:16.597\na more intelligent way\nthey're adapting to that.\n\n351\n00:19:16.597 --> 00:19:18.325\nSo pretty cool there.\n\n352\n00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:21.699\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that seems like it's close to\nthings like taking better advantage of\n\n353\n00:19:21.699 --> 00:19:22.867\nhardware acceleration.\n\n354\n00:19:22.867 --> 00:19:26.464\nWe can take more advantage of the hardware\nthat's underlying the architecture.\n\n355\n00:19:26.464 --> 00:19:27.133\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n356\n00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:28.014\nAnd you'll see,\n\n357\n00:19:28.014 --> 00:19:32.087\nwe're gonna get to other things that we\ncan do to improve that experience as well.\n\n358\n00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:35.097\nLike implementing guest\nintegration services and\n\n359\n00:19:35.097 --> 00:19:39.717\nthings of that nature just to kind of take\nit up a notch and make it a little more,\n\n360\n00:19:39.717 --> 00:19:41.748\nand I'll be the first to admit it.\n\n361\n00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:45.414\nVirtualization is not\nalways 100% seamless here.\n\n362\n00:19:45.414 --> 00:19:47.283\nThere are some quirks and things,\n\n363\n00:19:47.283 --> 00:19:51.344\nespecially you guys might even see me\nhere in our lab environments when I'm\n\n364\n00:19:51.344 --> 00:19:54.638\ntrying to execute keyboard shortcuts and\nthings like that.\n\n365\n00:19:54.638 --> 00:19:58.692\nSometimes you lose a little bit of that,\nbut we have still come a long way.\n\n366\n00:19:58.692 --> 00:20:00.752\nSo definitely.\n\n367\n00:20:00.752 --> 00:20:05.198\nAnd you guys may be also familiar with\nwe have already talked about WMI.\n\n368\n00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:09.286\nSo being able to remotely manage\nthese virtual machines, again,\n\n369\n00:20:09.286 --> 00:20:12.660\nplay back off of that Windows Management.\n\n370\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.586\nI can't ever remember that last-\n&gt;&gt; Instrumentation.\n\n371\n00:20:14.586 --> 00:20:15.521\n&gt;&gt; Instrumentation.\n\n372\n00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:17.243\nI was like not infrastructure.\n\n373\n00:20:17.243 --> 00:20:17.925\nBut yeah.\n\n374\n00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:19.865\n[LAUGH] Thank you, Wes.\n\n375\n00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:26.218\n[LAUGH] So those are just a few of the\nterms, but I'm looking at the time here.\n\n376\n00:20:26.218 --> 00:20:29.787\nI don't know,\ndid you know that I know how to do magic?\n\n377\n00:20:29.787 --> 00:20:30.555\n&gt;&gt; No, I did not.\n\n378\n00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:32.501\nI'm in for a treat here for\nthis one, I'm sure.\n\n379\n00:20:32.501 --> 00:20:33.634\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes.\n\n380\n00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:34.226\nThat's right.\n\n381\n00:20:34.226 --> 00:20:36.728\nI don't even know if you notice, but\n\n382\n00:20:36.728 --> 00:20:40.536\nI just made a computer magically\nappear out of thin air.\n\n383\n00:20:40.536 --> 00:20:41.827\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and that was magic.\n\n384\n00:20:41.827 --> 00:20:42.630\nI can tell you.\n\n385\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.495\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it's also magic\nthat this is actually a computer.\n\n386\n00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:46.404\nI mean, can't you tell?\n\n387\n00:20:46.404 --> 00:20:48.016\nIt says, hardware here.\n\n388\n00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:49.639\nSo, it's obviously gotta be a computer.\n\n389\n00:20:49.639 --> 00:20:50.266\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n390\n00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:53.191\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n391\n00:20:53.191 --> 00:20:58.417\nyou may hear these terms called\nabstraction layers, virtualization layers.\n\n392\n00:20:58.417 --> 00:21:01.338\nAnd then you're probably thinking,\nwell, what are they even talking about?\n\n393\n00:21:01.338 --> 00:21:03.936\nSo, this is what I was saying\nwhen we break it down for you.\n\n394\n00:21:03.936 --> 00:21:07.862\nSo if I have something like my hardware,\nthat physical box.\n\n395\n00:21:07.862 --> 00:21:12.496\nI'm gonna go ahead and take a look\nat what it means to go ahead and\n\n396\n00:21:12.496 --> 00:21:15.306\nbuild those virtualization layers.\n\n397\n00:21:15.306 --> 00:21:19.709\nSo, what we're looking at here is\ngoing to be an example of a type\n\n398\n00:21:19.709 --> 00:21:22.088\ntwo hypervisor implementation.\n\n399\n00:21:22.088 --> 00:21:25.358\nSo we'll take our hardware, our computer.\n\n400\n00:21:25.358 --> 00:21:30.622\nGo ahead and install a host\noperating system on top of it,\n\n401\n00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:34.363\nand then we will also have a hypervisor.\n\n402\n00:21:34.363 --> 00:21:39.093\nAnd that hypervisor will go ahead and\nsit on top of that host operating system.\n\n403\n00:21:39.093 --> 00:21:43.667\nSo the host operating system is actually\ngonna be sharing access to the hardware,\n\n404\n00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:45.534\nthe actual processor down here.\n\n405\n00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:48.458\nThere is a bit of\ncontention in this design.\n\n406\n00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:53.067\nSo, this is like the older implementation\nthat we see here with our type two\n\n407\n00:21:53.067 --> 00:21:54.025\nhypervisors.\n\n408\n00:21:54.025 --> 00:21:58.208\nSo each of one of the either\nthe guest operating systems,\n\n409\n00:21:58.208 --> 00:22:01.707\nthe hypervisor and\nthe host operating system.\n\n410\n00:22:01.707 --> 00:22:05.103\nThey're all accessing\nthe physical hardware here and\n\n411\n00:22:05.103 --> 00:22:09.180\nthe hypervisor is managing who\nhas access to those clock cycles.\n\n412\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.294\nSo there's a lot of a load there,\nbut it's pretty cool.\n\n413\n00:22:12.294 --> 00:22:16.738\nBecause you can still then implement\ndifferent operating systems here.\n\n414\n00:22:16.738 --> 00:22:18.909\nI know it's a little bit hard,\nthere you go.\n\n415\n00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:23.193\nI know poor little XP and you can\ndifferent virtual machines running within\n\n416\n00:22:23.193 --> 00:22:28.089\nthat operating system there, but all the\ncommunications are going directly through\n\n417\n00:22:28.089 --> 00:22:32.713\nthe, or not all, but your virtual machines\nare going through the hypervisor and\n\n418\n00:22:32.713 --> 00:22:36.048\nthe operating system to\ncommunicate with that hardware.\n\n419\n00:22:36.048 --> 00:22:39.816\nSo, it's not 100%\nefficient in this design.\n\n420\n00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:43.296\nSo, this is called a type two hypervisor.\n\n421\n00:22:43.296 --> 00:22:47.477\nWhen we talk about our Hyper-V,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n422\n00:22:47.477 --> 00:22:51.688\nSo, Hyper-V is going to be using\nwhat's called a type one hypervisor.\n\n423\n00:22:51.688 --> 00:22:54.043\nLet me go ahead and\nexplain that one to you.\n\n424\n00:22:54.043 --> 00:22:55.215\nIt's a little strange.\n\n425\n00:22:55.215 --> 00:22:59.056\nIt might not seem like a type one\nhypervisor, but I'll tell you why it is.\n\n426\n00:22:59.056 --> 00:23:01.494\nSo with hyper VM and\nwe're talking type one,\n\n427\n00:23:01.494 --> 00:23:05.424\nsometimes you'll even hear this being\ncalled a bare metal hypervisor.\n\n428\n00:23:05.424 --> 00:23:09.287\nBecause we're directly communicating\nwith the bare metal or the hardware.\n\n429\n00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:12.074\nSo, we really don't even\nneed an operating system.\n\n430\n00:23:12.074 --> 00:23:14.014\nI mean, we can just apply that hypervisor.\n\n431\n00:23:14.014 --> 00:23:17.716\nAs a matter of fact,\none of the deployments of Hyper-V,\n\n432\n00:23:17.716 --> 00:23:22.048\nthere is the Hyper-V server which\njust comes in a core version,.\n\n433\n00:23:22.048 --> 00:23:23.101\nIt's free.\n\n434\n00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.996\nYou can download it from Microsoft.\n\n435\n00:23:24.996 --> 00:23:28.973\nIt's actually the preferred method\nin a production environment,\n\n436\n00:23:28.973 --> 00:23:31.216\nbecause we have a smaller footprint.\n\n437\n00:23:31.216 --> 00:23:32.743\nAnd for security purposes,\n\n438\n00:23:32.743 --> 00:23:37.194\nI can be more efficient with the amount of\nmachines that I'm running on the hardware\n\n439\n00:23:37.194 --> 00:23:40.820\nlike we were speaking about\nearlier with that utilization.\n\n440\n00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.600\nSo if we take a look at this here,\nthe hypervisor with a type one\n\n441\n00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.825\nimplementation is gonna be\na little bit different.\n\n442\n00:23:47.825 --> 00:23:51.410\nBecause whenever you go ahead and\ninstall a hypervisor, so let's say,\n\n443\n00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.543\nwe install Hyper-V.\n\n444\n00:23:52.543 --> 00:23:56.345\nThe first thing that happens\nis we'll go ahead and\n\n445\n00:23:56.345 --> 00:23:59.703\nthe system will create a parent partition.\n\n446\n00:23:59.703 --> 00:24:02.530\nSo your paired partition\nis gonna be responsible for\n\n447\n00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:06.065\na number of things including like\nthe subsystems that are gonna be\n\n448\n00:24:06.065 --> 00:24:09.034\ndirectly affecting\nthe performance of the computer.\n\n449\n00:24:09.034 --> 00:24:12.093\nAnd so\nit's pretty important here to go ahead and\n\n450\n00:24:12.093 --> 00:24:14.980\nhave your apparent partition created.\n\n451\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.060\nAnd then,\n\n452\n00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.960\neach partition subsequent created is\ngoing to be called a child partition.\n\n453\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.440\nSo these are gonna be your children and\nultimately,\n\n454\n00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.600\nthey're just the same\nas what we saw before.\n\n455\n00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.210\nThey're gonna be our different\nguest operating systems, okay?\n\n456\n00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:35.740\nSo, the reason I said that\nHyper V may not appear to be\n\n457\n00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.360\na type one hypervisor, is because we don't\nalways see it in this implementation.\n\n458\n00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.638\nYou know Wes, you and I, we had talked\nabout even having Hyper V running on\n\n459\n00:24:44.638 --> 00:24:48.170\na client machine, a Windows 8.1 or\nWindows 10 client.\n\n460\n00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.930\nSo you're like, hey though, where's\nthe operating system in that equation?\n\n461\n00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.125\nSo let me grab it, okay?\n\n462\n00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:57.330\n[LAUGH] So\nhere's our host operating system.\n\n463\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.347\nAnd if I can, maybe, Wes,\nif you want to lift the blue box.\n\n464\n00:25:00.347 --> 00:25:01.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.\n\n465\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah,\nwe'll just slide that right in.\n\n466\n00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.780\nSo theoretically, what Hyper V does is,\n\n467\n00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.890\nif we could burrow a hole right through\nthis yellow host operating system it\n\n468\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.440\ncreates like a tunnel for communication.\n\n469\n00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.148\nSo we still have that direct access to the\nhardware and that's why Hyper V is still\n\n470\n00:25:21.148 --> 00:25:25.940\nconsidered a type one hypervisor and we\ndon't have that contention for this CPU.\n\n471\n00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.890\nBecause we're directly communicating\nwith our hardware components there,\n\n472\n00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:34.030\nso overall type two hypervisors are gonna\nbe more efficient, excuse me type one.\n\n473\n00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.770\nAnd I know, it's kinda crazy,\ncuz you think type two,\n\n474\n00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.416\ntwo comes after version 2.0.\n\n475\n00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:42.018\nBut it's actually the opposite here\nwhen we're talking about type one and\n\n476\n00:25:42.018 --> 00:25:43.500\ntype two hypervisors.\n\n477\n00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.470\nSo that's definitely something to\nconsider as we move forward and\n\n478\n00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.990\ntake look at installing and\nsetting up Hyper V.\n\n479\n00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.780\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n480\n00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.690\na lot of great information there\nin virtualization as you can see.\n\n481\n00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.190\nI mean it's gonna be important and\n\n482\n00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.320\nas we move into the future visualization's\ngonna become more and more popular.\n\n483\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.600\nSo it is important to understand it not\nonly for the 7410 exam but also for\n\n484\n00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.460\nthe real world out there.\n\n485\n00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.250\nNow, looking at the time clock Cherokee,\n\n486\n00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.860\nit does look like we're coming to\nthe end of yet another great episode.\n\n487\n00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.480\nBut before we do,\n\n488\n00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.380\ndo you have any parting words that you'd\nlike to maybe tell the viewers here?\n\n489\n00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.572\nOr are we gonna go ahead and\nwe'll just end it here?\n\n490\n00:26:15.572 --> 00:26:17.284\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I think we're good for now,\n\n491\n00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:20.587\nI mean there are a couple other\ndifferent deployment options but\n\n492\n00:26:20.587 --> 00:26:24.640\nI think we'll probably get to them,\ntalking about how to utilize RSAT tools.\n\n493\n00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.508\nWe don't necessarily have to be running\nHyper V on a client machine, to\n\n494\n00:26:28.508 --> 00:26:33.560\ngo ahead and manage our virtual machines,\nyou don't have to have that role running.\n\n495\n00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.925\nBut there are just a lot of different\ngreat ways that we can implement Hyper V,\n\n496\n00:26:37.925 --> 00:26:39.669\nand if this is brand new to you,\n\n497\n00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:43.044\nthen definitely take the time\nto learn about it, because.\n\n498\n00:26:43.044 --> 00:26:45.376\nIt's very seldom that\nthere's a situation or\n\n499\n00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:48.210\na business that really\ncouldn't benefit from Hyper V.\n\n500\n00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\npleasure having you here, Cherokee.\n\n501\n00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.310\nThanks for joining us and thank you to\nyou, the viewer for joining us as well.\n\n502\n00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.940\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n503\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:56.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n504\n00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:57.585\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:14.606\nYou're watching ITProTV Hello and welcome\nto another great episode here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:16.118\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n5\n00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:20.080\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series in 7410.\n\n6\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.460\nThat's right the MCSA in\nWindows Server 2012, and\n\n7\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.690\njoining us back in the studio is\nnone other than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.327\nCherokee, how are you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:27.140\nI'm doing amazing.\n\n10\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.104\nHow are you today Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:29.023\nI am doing great,\n\n12\n00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:33.090\non our last episode we were talking\nabout virtualization technologies.\n\n13\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.830\nWhat is virtualization?\n\n14\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.500\nBut the one thing I didn't see,\nwe talked all about the Hyper-V role,\n\n15\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.520\nbut we didn't actually go through\nthe installation process.\n\n16\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.026\nSo you're gonna help us get Hyper-V\ninstalled and get the ball rolling.\n\n17\n00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:46.629\nYeah, let's get hyped for\nsome Hyper-V, West.\n\n18\n00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:47.604\nAll right, very good, [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:50.936\n[LAUGH] Yeah, we can't really install\nany kind of a virtual machine or\n\n20\n00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:54.000\ncreate them unless we have\nthat Hyper-V role installed.\n\n21\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.397\nSo by default that's not\nsomething that is installed,\n\n22\n00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:59.920\nwe'll need to take the initiative there\nif that's something we want to utilize.\n\n23\n00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.700\nAnd just like with everything else, we do\nhave the ability to leverage PowerShell.\n\n24\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.980\nSo let's go ahead and start there,\n\n25\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.180\nI think that would be a great place\nto just show you at least the syntax.\n\n26\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.280\nSo you do feel comfortable if you choose\nto go ahead and install it that way.\n\n27\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.630\nOn my screen, I've already pulled up\nan administrative command prompt here, and\n\n28\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.400\njust changed the directory for the see\ndrive to give ourselves a little bit more\n\n29\n00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.369\nof space here,\nbecause these commands and commandlets.\n\n30\n00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.659\nThe commandlets are small,\nbut the command,\n\n31\n00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.875\nwhen we utilize multiple cmdlets together.\n\n32\n00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.788\nAnd then, start typing them out into\nother commands, it can get pretty long.\n\n33\n00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:38.956\nSo the first thing that I do wanna\nshow you is just we'll use the wild\n\n34\n00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:44.220\ncard to see what kind of components\nwe're talking about here.\n\n35\n00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.290\nSo if I go ahead and type in it, if I'm\ntyping, I never am typing in this thing.\n\n36\n00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.624\nAll right, so\nyou say get-Windows feature, And\n\n37\n00:01:55.624 --> 00:02:01.478\nwe're gonna be specifying the name, but\nhere we're gonna be using the asterisk and\n\n38\n00:02:01.478 --> 00:02:07.140\nwe'll use the term hyper to kinda look for\nanything with this term hyper in it.\n\n39\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.200\nSo because we're talking about Hyper-V,\nI can see on this first line\n\n40\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.342\nthat Hyper V is not installed and\nif I scroll over all the way to my right,\n\n41\n00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:21.146\nI can see in that far column,\nit does say available.\n\n42\n00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:25.671\nAnd then all the way in my left\ncolumn over here in those brackets,\n\n43\n00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:29.478\nthere would be an x there if\nit actually was installed.\n\n44\n00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:30.914\nSo I need to go ahead and\n\n45\n00:02:30.914 --> 00:02:34.631\nget that installed here on this\nsystem to be able to use it.\n\n46\n00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:38.816\nBut also notice there are some\nsub components here for\n\n47\n00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:41.330\nmy Hyper-V management tools.\n\n48\n00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.227\nAnd if you look at this column right\nhere underneath name, you can actually\n\n49\n00:02:46.227 --> 00:02:51.520\nsee the PowerShell name that we can use\nto go ahead and get those installed.\n\n50\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.671\nSo, the syntax would be Install, and\nthis is going to be -windowsFeature.\n\n51\n00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:01.444\nI'm not sure if there's a space there,\nbut we'll find out.\n\n52\n00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:05.749\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthis is gonna be Install windowsFeature,\n\n53\n00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:10.360\nthis is going to be name, and\nthen we'll specify those names.\n\n54\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.580\nSo, what we could do, Wes,\na couple of different things.\n\n55\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.520\nNumber one, we wanna make sure we get that\nHyper-V in there first, so dash Hyper-V.\n\n56\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.210\nAnd then,\nI can use comma-separated values here.\n\n57\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.235\nAnd I could go ahead and\ntype in my RSAT, Hyper-vTools.\n\n58\n00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:32.657\nAnd if I can spell that again.\n\n59\n00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:39.901\nGo through and mark those up individually\nand add all three of those there.\n\n60\n00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:41.900\nThat's a little bit extra typing.\n\n61\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.340\nSo an easier way I could do that,\nI'm just gonna back pedal here.\n\n62\n00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.560\nAnd I'm gonna get rid of that comma,\nand then if I just do the space dash.\n\n63\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.310\nInclude management tools\nthat'll go ahead and\n\n64\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.810\ngrab all three of those to make it\na little faster of an install for you.\n\n65\n00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.590\nSo, let's just see,\nI should have my tab here.\n\n66\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.050\nIf I can get enough managementTools.\n\n67\n00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:15.497\nAnd then for this particular installation,\n\n68\n00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:18.560\nyou are gonna be required\nto perform restart.\n\n69\n00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.480\nSo, we definitely we add\nthat parameter as well.\n\n70\n00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.250\nAnd we were just go ahead and\nhit Restart there.\n\n71\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.140\nNow, I could see where that might get\nme in trouble with the tools here.\n\n72\n00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.330\nI would figure that, hey if we're gonna\ninstall the role in the feature right,\n\n73\n00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.818\nwe're gonna have our tools with us.\n\n74\n00:04:33.818 --> 00:04:38.050\nBut it kinda looks like that's\nnot the case, is that the case?\n\n75\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.840\nSo Wes, that's really a great question.\n\n76\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.800\nBecause if you think about\nthe logic behind that,\n\n77\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.110\nwe don't always have to go ahead and\nmanage\n\n78\n00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.910\nthe machines that are gonna be running\non that Hyper-V server there directly.\n\n79\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.630\nFor instance, we may be running on a\nclient-side operating system like we spoke\n\n80\n00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.730\nabout before.\n\n81\n00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.481\nSo I have the option to go ahead and\nreduce that footprint,\n\n82\n00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.456\nwhich would be a great idea for security.\n\n83\n00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:06.623\nOr even just for performance having less\ncoding and less on that actual machine,\n\n84\n00:05:06.623 --> 00:05:10.530\nso I can have it offset it\nto another machine there.\n\n85\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.040\nSo by default and PowerShell know those\nmanagementTools are not included, so\n\n86\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.100\nif you want them,\nyou'll need to go ahead and install them.\n\n87\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.010\nBut, we do have the ability\nto go ahead and\n\n88\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.000\ninstall that through our\ngraphical user interface as well.\n\n89\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.480\nSo if we take a look at my screen I just\nhave server manager pulled right up here,\n\n90\n00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.640\nand just like with other roles,\nit's very simple.\n\n91\n00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.650\nI could just go right here and\nadd roles, and\n\n92\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.198\nfeatures, and\njust say hello to my welcome page.\n\n93\n00:05:35.198 --> 00:05:39.970\nThis is gonna be a role or feature\nbased installation, we we'll hit Next.\n\n94\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.820\nAnd again, if I have the ability to go\nahead and have additional servers here,\n\n95\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.362\nmy pull.\n\n96\n00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:46.480\nI could select one, but\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n97\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.430\ninstall that here locally\non my PLAB Hyper-V machine.\n\n98\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.700\nNow, when we click on the actual role\nthere, when I clicked in that box,\n\n99\n00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.636\nyou can automatically see, and\nlet me try to zoom in for you there.\n\n100\n00:05:59.636 --> 00:06:03.773\nIt's a little too much, but\nyou can see these different\n\n101\n00:06:03.773 --> 00:06:08.010\nsubfeatures just like we saw\npreviously in PowerShell.\n\n102\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.502\nSo the graphical user interface is just\ncalling upon those to go ahead and\n\n103\n00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:12.372\nadd them as well.\n\n104\n00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.620\nDo you have the ability\nto uncheck that here?\n\n105\n00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.446\nSo it's kind of like do exact\nopposite here in the GUI.\n\n106\n00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:21.720\nIt kind of wants you have\nthose managementTools, but\n\n107\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.840\nyou can remove them if you want to.\n\n108\n00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.931\nBut I'm just gonna go ahead and\nkeep them, and we'll hit AddFeatures.\n\n109\n00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:32.190\nLet me back out of here a little bit,\nand we'll hit Next.\n\n110\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.590\nAnd just Next right through here.\n\n111\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:41.510\nNow, remember we do need to perform\na restart so we'll keep that in mind also.\n\n112\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.740\nNow, this interesting for\nmy virtual switches here I only have\n\n113\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.620\none adapter in my network interface\ncard in this actual demonstration.\n\n114\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.353\nBut in reality, you really don't want to\nset up a Hyperview machine with only one.\n\n115\n00:06:57.353 --> 00:06:59.757\nI mean it's always great\nto have at least two for\n\n116\n00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:02.231\nredundancy there in\na production environment.\n\n117\n00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:04.650\nBut we'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n118\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.880\nAll right, now this is something\nelse we'll take a look at.\n\n119\n00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.922\nWe do have the ability to go ahead and\nimplement and use live migration.\n\n120\n00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:16.210\nWe're not gonna do this at that time but\nwe could go ahead and select that here.\n\n121\n00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.900\nAlso if you are running a cluster like\nyou had mentioned previously, Wes.\n\n122\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.860\nI don't really,\nI don't wanna handle light migration here,\n\n123\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.120\nI'm gonna go ahead and configure that\nseparately through the clusters.\n\n124\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.400\nSo they're just noting, that as well,\nbut we'll go ahead and hit Next.\n\n125\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.740\nNow, this is going to be the default\nlocation for my virtual hard disk files.\n\n126\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.564\nSo, I can see here,\nthis is just the default location, but\n\n127\n00:07:41.564 --> 00:07:46.001\nif I wanted to go ahead and change\nthat location to like I said before,\n\n128\n00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:51.073\nfaster drive or maybe you have the central\nrepository or something like that.\n\n129\n00:07:51.073 --> 00:07:56.473\nYou could go ahead and do that,\nas well as for those XML files down here,\n\n130\n00:07:56.473 --> 00:08:02.694\nthere's configuration files that will\nkeep them in the default, just hit Next.\n\n131\n00:08:02.694 --> 00:08:05.219\nAnd this is the option here\nwhere you can go ahead and\n\n132\n00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:07.580\ncheck that to automatically restart.\n\n133\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.880\nNow just remember if you are in a\nproduction environment you need to just be\n\n134\n00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.380\ncognizant of the fact that hey,\nthis machine is gonna be restarting, so\n\n135\n00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.250\nyou wanna make sure you're not\ngonna be affecting anyone or\n\n136\n00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.730\ncausing any downtime there.\n\n137\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.910\nSo we'll go ahead and hit Yes, so it's\nnot a big deal in this demo environment.\n\n138\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.655\nIt doesn't doesn't take too long to\nbegin this role installation, and\n\n139\n00:08:26.655 --> 00:08:27.967\nthen it will go ahead and restart.\n\n140\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.009\nHopefully not too long here, [LAUGH],\ngotta love those awkward pauses, right?\n\n141\n00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:40.066\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 30% of your entire IT career is\njust staring at a progress bar, right, and\n\n142\n00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:41.645\nwaiting on a reboot, for sure.\n\n143\n00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:43.777\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It shouldn't take too long here, but\n\n144\n00:08:43.777 --> 00:08:44.440\nyou know what?\n\n145\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.812\nWe'll come back and check on that,\n\n146\n00:08:45.812 --> 00:08:47.837\nas a matter of fact we can\ntalk about something else.\n\n147\n00:08:47.837 --> 00:08:51.059\nI did want to mention to you guys\nthe difference between Gen 1 and\n\n148\n00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:51.961\nGen 2 machines.\n\n149\n00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:57.737\nSo in earlier versions of virtualization,\nand even the server 2008,\n\n150\n00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:02.360\nit wasn't called Gen 1 because\nthere wasn't a Gen 2 yet.\n\n151\n00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.002\nSo with the advent of Gen 2 then we\n\n152\n00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:09.690\nretroactively name those\nolder systems Gen 1.\n\n153\n00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.120\nSo we have two options,\n\n154\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.795\nand when we create our virtual machines\nwe'll need to make that decision.\n\n155\n00:09:16.795 --> 00:09:21.370\nBecause this is not, a lot of different\noptions that we see we can easily change,\n\n156\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.840\nbut this isn't one of them.\n\n157\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.440\nI won't say it's impossible to change,\nbut Microsoft,\n\n158\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.480\nif you're taking the exam that's\nsomething that you need to be aware of,\n\n159\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.020\nthey do say that it's\nsomething you cannot change.\n\n160\n00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.680\nSo it's something you'll need to choose\nwisely when you're making this decision of\n\n161\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.270\nhey, am I gonna create Gen 1 or Gen 2?\n\n162\n00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.500\nAnd here's the deal,\nGen 1 is really good for\n\n163\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.059\nenvironments if you have older systems,\n\n164\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:55.190\nyou can't even use Vista or previous\noperating systems as Gen 2 machines.\n\n165\n00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:00.266\nSo if you kind of have a mixed\nenvironment, or even anticipate needing\n\n166\n00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:05.955\nan older system for that particular\nmachine, then definitely go with Gen 1.\n\n167\n00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:09.835\nIt's not a huge performance\nany kind of lack there,\n\n168\n00:10:09.835 --> 00:10:13.550\nthey're pretty comparable\nGen 1 versus Gen 2.\n\n169\n00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:19.156\nBut the hardware components you'll\nsee a big change there if we note Gen\n\n170\n00:10:19.156 --> 00:10:25.270\n1 is gonna be based off of a BIOS platform\nwhereas Gen 2 is gonna be with UEFI.\n\n171\n00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.210\nSo again back to the operating system\nthat will be running on that machine, for\n\n172\n00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:34.340\ninstance if I'm talking about our newer\noperating systems they're based on UEFI so\n\n173\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.830\nI wouldn't even be able to\ninstall them on a Gen 1.\n\n174\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.510\nSo really looking at your environment\nthat's what's gonna determine what's\n\n175\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.700\nbetter for you, not Gen 1 is\nbetter than Gen 2 or whatever.\n\n176\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.230\nJust the way that it's designed,\nfor instance Gen 1 machines and\n\n177\n00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.310\nthe way that they're configured and\nthat they boot they're gonna be booting\n\n178\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.400\noff of IDE drives,\nwhereas we would use IDE for\n\n179\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.880\nthe ISO images that we're booting to\nas well as for the HD and VHDX files.\n\n180\n00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.970\nGen 2 utilizes SCSI drives for those VHD\nand VHDX files, as well as those ISOs.\n\n181\n00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:16.540\nYou can use SCSI, but strictly for storage\nin Gen 1, so there are some issues there,\n\n182\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:22.826\nyou don't have access to older\ncomponents such as floppy drives and\n\n183\n00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:26.960\ncomports in your Gen 2\nthat you do in Gen 1.\n\n184\n00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.615\nSo really just looking at those factors\nthat will be the decision when you're\n\n185\n00:11:31.615 --> 00:11:34.626\nrunning through the new\nvirtual machine wizard or\n\n186\n00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:39.300\ncreating that there in PowerShell,\nso just kind of keep that in mind.\n\n187\n00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.532\nAm I missing anything here?\n\n188\n00:11:43.532 --> 00:11:47.690\nServer, okay,\nthis should say Server 2012 and later.\n\n189\n00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:52.953\nAnd then also it's for\nthe client side for Gen 2, Windows 8.1 and\n\n190\n00:11:52.953 --> 00:11:58.579\nlater for Gen 2 machines, and\nthere's no option to mount to a physical,\n\n191\n00:11:58.579 --> 00:12:03.976\nand that is spelled wrong there, but\nphysical disk for Gen 2 as well.\n\n192\n00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:09.301\nOkay, let me check back on this machine\nthat we had going on for that restart.\n\n193\n00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.740\nTry to connect.\n\n194\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.641\nAll right.\n\n195\n00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:28.210\nGive it a second here to see if our\nHyper-V installation was complete there.\n\n196\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.767\nAll right, if you zoom in\na little bit you can see yes,\n\n197\n00:12:36.767 --> 00:12:41.300\nthe installation has succeeded on\nPLEV Hyper-V, so we're good to go there.\n\n198\n00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.585\nI'll go ahead and just hit Close and\nyou can see it just pop up right here.\n\n199\n00:12:46.585 --> 00:12:50.019\nAnd also on the left-hand\nside you'll notice that's\n\n200\n00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:54.357\nit's been added to the menu in that\nleft pane and you'll see events.\n\n201\n00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:58.773\nThen if you scroll down you can see\nadditional information such as services\n\n202\n00:12:58.773 --> 00:13:03.611\nrunning, there's also some monitoring\ninformation if my machine will actually\n\n203\n00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:04.818\nscroll down there.\n\n204\n00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:08.940\nBut really getting into that Hyper-V\nmanager is going to be where you\n\n205\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.410\nspend the majority of your time.\n\n206\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:16.270\nOver here on the right-hand side,\nunder Tools in the drop down menu\n\n207\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.246\nyou should then see the Hyper-V manager so\nwe can just go ahead and pull that up.\n\n208\n00:13:20.246 --> 00:13:25.220\nAnd if you're gonna be working in it\na lot you could even pin it to your task\n\n209\n00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.600\nbar for easy access and things like that.\n\n210\n00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.155\nBut here you can see my virtual\nmachines and the state,\n\n211\n00:13:33.155 --> 00:13:37.944\nstate meaning if they're powered on,\npowered off, and then if they were\n\n212\n00:13:37.944 --> 00:13:42.812\npowered on here you can see other metric\ninformation such as the CPU usage,\n\n213\n00:13:42.812 --> 00:13:47.401\nassigned memory uptime, and\nany kind of status information as well.\n\n214\n00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:51.990\nCheckpoints, so what did we mention or\nreference them as something in\n\n215\n00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.820\nthe previous show,\nI always get those two terms mixed up.\n\n216\n00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.815\n&gt;&gt; Snapshots?\n&gt;&gt; Snapshots,\n\n217\n00:13:56.815 --> 00:14:01.458\nthey used to be called snapshots and some\nof the documentation that you come across\n\n218\n00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:04.485\nwill say that, so\nit basically means the same thing,\n\n219\n00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:08.480\njust know that those terms mean\nthe same when you're taking the exam.\n\n220\n00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.471\nAnd it just takes a clear as-is\npicture of the operating system and\n\n221\n00:14:13.471 --> 00:14:18.103\nsaves that, that you can revert\nto a previous point in time for\n\n222\n00:14:18.103 --> 00:14:21.241\nconfiguring and the oops button I guess.\n\n223\n00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:22.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n224\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.648\nI always call it the get out of jail free\ncard because I can help you fix a computer\n\n225\n00:14:25.648 --> 00:14:27.625\nbut I can also help you\ntear down a network and\n\n226\n00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:30.650\na computer at the same time, so\nI absolutely love restore points.\n\n227\n00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.105\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Being able to revert to an earlier\n\n228\n00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:35.771\npoint in time, especially when you install\na piece of software that you're testing,\n\n229\n00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:36.790\nbecomes problematic.\n\n230\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.420\nAll of a sudden it's\ngiving you a hard time and\n\n231\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.270\nyou're like do I really wanna pull my\nhair out figuring out what's going on or\n\n232\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.040\ndo I just revert back to\nan earlier point in time?\n\n233\n00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.730\nI'll tell you, check points\nare worth their weight in gold.\n\n234\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:54.260\n&gt;&gt; Definitely they've saved me,\nthat's for sure, not a replacement for\n\n235\n00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.750\nbackups but definitely something\na great supplemental tool.\n\n236\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.150\nAnd so let's see here,\n\n237\n00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.910\nlet's see how we can actually create\nthat VM like Wes had asked about.\n\n238\n00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.090\nSo you can create a VM in PowerShell,\nI'll walk you through how to do it\n\n239\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.350\nhere in the GUI and we'll also take\na look at the syntax in PowerShell.\n\n240\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:14.040\nIt's pretty simple, a couple different\nways to go ahead and execute this.\n\n241\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.387\nOn the left-hand side you could just right\nclick on top of this Hyper-V server and\n\n242\n00:15:18.387 --> 00:15:19.088\nselect New.\n\n243\n00:15:19.088 --> 00:15:23.320\nLet's see, new virtual machine,\n\n244\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.210\nthe first option there, I don't know\nwhy I was going blind for a second.\n\n245\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:30.560\nBut also over on the right-hand\nside you do have another option,\n\n246\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.990\nif I scroll over you can see that as well,\nso just a couple different ways here.\n\n247\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.250\nAgain you get that pop-up action menu,\nnew virtual machine.\n\n248\n00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.730\nAnd the wizard's kind of nice to walk\nyou through this if you haven't done it\n\n249\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:48.200\nbefore so let's go ahead and\nget that started, we'll select Next.\n\n250\n00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.520\nAnd I don't know,\nwhat do we wanna name this machine?\n\n251\n00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.595\nI'm not feeling creative,\nlet's just say Server01 for now?\n\n252\n00:15:54.595 --> 00:15:55.171\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n253\n00:15:55.171 --> 00:15:59.822\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nagain we saw that default location when we\n\n254\n00:15:59.822 --> 00:16:03.296\nwere performing that installation\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n255\n00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:07.769\nI do have the ability to change that for\nthe storage of my actual machine.\n\n256\n00:16:07.769 --> 00:16:11.430\nBut for right now, I can just\nkeep it in that default location.\n\n257\n00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:15.296\nAnd then you're getting\na little notification here.\n\n258\n00:16:15.296 --> 00:16:17.097\nLet me zoom in, so you can see that.\n\n259\n00:16:17.097 --> 00:16:18.109\nThis is a good point.\n\n260\n00:16:18.109 --> 00:16:20.559\nWe were just talking about\nthose checkpoints there, Wes.\n\n261\n00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:23.074\nBut it says, if I can navigate.\n\n262\n00:16:23.074 --> 00:16:25.702\nIf you plan to take checkpoints\nof this virtual machine,\n\n263\n00:16:25.702 --> 00:16:28.067\nthen select a location that\nhas enough free space.\n\n264\n00:16:28.067 --> 00:16:32.026\nAnd that's always something you wanna\nconsider, because those screenshots can\n\n265\n00:16:32.026 --> 00:16:35.708\nget pretty hefty, specially if you take\nthem while the machine is running.\n\n266\n00:16:35.708 --> 00:16:38.779\nSo, you wanna make sure\nyou have adequate storage.\n\n267\n00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:41.768\nSo, don't get too click happy\nwith those checkpoints things.\n\n268\n00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:46.790\n&gt;&gt; And you had mentioned earlier in the\nepisode that there might be a reason where\n\n269\n00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.595\nmaybe you are storing that on a SAN\nwith high speed, maybe fiber channel.\n\n270\n00:16:51.595 --> 00:16:55.438\nAnd I don't wanna store on the local\nmachine, so I can redirect it over to my\n\n271\n00:16:55.438 --> 00:16:58.804\nhigh speed storage and then later\nget access to it when we need to.\n\n272\n00:16:58.804 --> 00:17:00.130\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n\n273\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.843\nYeah, you'll notice and\nthat's a good point actually, Wes and\n\n274\n00:17:03.843 --> 00:17:05.540\nI didn't even mention this.\n\n275\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.836\nBut I mean, you're great with hardware.\n\n276\n00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:09.897\nSo if you think about it, we don't.\n\n277\n00:17:09.897 --> 00:17:12.320\nAlthough it doesn't say\nin the documentation,\n\n278\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.578\nany kind of system requirements for\nspindle drives or whatever.\n\n279\n00:17:15.578 --> 00:17:18.810\nBut you definitely wanna consider,\nhey, we're talking server grades.\n\n280\n00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.853\nSo 54 or 100 RPM Is what I recommend, but\n\n281\n00:17:21.853 --> 00:17:25.309\nat least if you're not\ngonna be using solid state.\n\n282\n00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:27.458\nSo, you just wanna consider\nthose types of things and\n\n283\n00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:29.350\nwhere you are storing information.\n\n284\n00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:34.442\nIf you have maybe a slower drive, use that\nfor a file server or something instead.\n\n285\n00:17:34.442 --> 00:17:36.699\nBut it just depends.\n\n286\n00:17:36.699 --> 00:17:40.677\nBut my gosh, this is the point in time\nwhere we have to make those decisions and\n\n287\n00:17:40.677 --> 00:17:42.800\nit's like no, no going back here.\n\n288\n00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.492\nActually, they even give\nyou a little warning there.\n\n289\n00:17:45.492 --> 00:17:49.787\nIt says, once the virtual machine has been\ncreated, you cannot change its generation.\n\n290\n00:17:49.787 --> 00:17:51.672\nSo just remember.\n\n291\n00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:53.416\nLet's go ahead and create a gen two.\n\n292\n00:17:53.416 --> 00:17:57.086\nWe've already got a couple gen\n1's sitting back here behind us.\n\n293\n00:17:57.086 --> 00:18:00.660\nSo, I wanna show you the difference\nbetween those options.\n\n294\n00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.722\nSo, we'll just hit Next.\n\n295\n00:18:02.722 --> 00:18:04.389\nNow, let me change the memory.\n\n296\n00:18:04.389 --> 00:18:09.250\nThe reason I want to do this here now,\nI know it's still kind of silly.\n\n297\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:14.437\nI'm gonna go with 1,536 megabytes here and\nthat's because,\n\n298\n00:18:14.437 --> 00:18:18.172\nof course,\nit'll make a faster installation.\n\n299\n00:18:18.172 --> 00:18:22.795\nBut you according to whatever memory you\nhave in the physical machine available,\n\n300\n00:18:22.795 --> 00:18:24.876\nyou can allocate that accordingly.\n\n301\n00:18:24.876 --> 00:18:27.362\nBut there's something\nkind of cool here and\n\n302\n00:18:27.362 --> 00:18:30.190\nwe have this option to\nconfigure dynamic memory.\n\n303\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.714\nSo by default, it's not selected.\n\n304\n00:18:32.714 --> 00:18:37.975\nBut if I do select this option,\nthen there's a couple other additional\n\n305\n00:18:37.975 --> 00:18:44.400\nfeatures that I will have access to\nthat will enhance a memory capabilities.\n\n306\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.984\nSo, we'll go ahead and select Next there.\n\n307\n00:18:48.984 --> 00:18:54.865\nNow we have a, we'll go ahead and\nselect our Intel gigabit for\n\n308\n00:18:54.865 --> 00:19:00.560\nmy virtual switch here and\nwe'll hit Next and 120 gigs.\n\n309\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.759\nEverything looks good to go,\nwe'll go ahead and hit Next and Finish.\n\n310\n00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:07.757\nWe'll install the operating system later.\n\n311\n00:19:07.757 --> 00:19:11.663\nYou also have the option to point to that\nISO right here if you need a location, but\n\n312\n00:19:11.663 --> 00:19:15.350\nwe're really just gonna be looking at\nthe properties moving forward here.\n\n313\n00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:20.042\nAnd these last like summary\npages are great to go ahead and\n\n314\n00:19:20.042 --> 00:19:24.513\neven screen shot and just save for\ndocumentation, for auditing or for\n\n315\n00:19:24.513 --> 00:19:27.265\nyour IT department and we'll hit Finish.\n\n316\n00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:31.956\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee, this is creating\nbasically like a bare metal machine.\n\n317\n00:19:31.956 --> 00:19:34.505\nYou said, we're gonna install\nthe operating system later.\n\n318\n00:19:34.505 --> 00:19:38.133\nSo basically, what we've done is\nlogically created t like his server.\n\n319\n00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:39.530\n&gt;&gt; Like a placeholder, yeah.\n\n320\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.865\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, very cool.\n\n321\n00:19:40.865 --> 00:19:43.253\n&gt;&gt; A container or virtual machine, but\n\n322\n00:19:43.253 --> 00:19:46.264\nit's just kinda hollow\nat this point in time.\n\n323\n00:19:46.264 --> 00:19:52.615\nAnd so let's go ahead and just right-click\nand select the settings for this machine,\n\n324\n00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:58.186\nand what I wanted to do here is show\nthe difference between the two machines.\n\n325\n00:19:58.186 --> 00:20:01.435\nSo let's say, this TLAB Win802.\n\n326\n00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:03.581\nWe'll select the settings there.\n\n327\n00:20:03.581 --> 00:20:06.305\nAnd if I can find both of\nthose settings options,\n\n328\n00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:09.370\nI'll have to can move things\naround a little bit here.\n\n329\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.810\nGive me a second.\n\n330\n00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.255\nI've got like my virtual machines\ninside of a virtual machine.\n\n331\n00:20:19.255 --> 00:20:22.870\n[LAUGH] Fun stuff.\n\n332\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.435\nBut if we take a look at this now,\neven just the options are different.\n\n333\n00:20:26.435 --> 00:20:27.874\nSo my server01.\n\n334\n00:20:27.874 --> 00:20:31.320\nRemember this one in blue,\nthe one over here in our right.\n\n335\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.217\nThis is the machine that we just created,\nthe gen 2 machine.\n\n336\n00:20:34.217 --> 00:20:37.742\nAnd if I look over to my left,\nI can see that this machine,\n\n337\n00:20:37.742 --> 00:20:39.215\nnow this one is in blue.\n\n338\n00:20:39.215 --> 00:20:43.059\nPLAB Win802, this is our gen 1.\n\n339\n00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:44.244\nDid I say that right?\n\n340\n00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:47.506\nGen 1, gen 2 over here.\n\n341\n00:20:47.506 --> 00:20:51.908\nAnd looking at the hardware options,\nyou can see how they do differ.\n\n342\n00:20:51.908 --> 00:20:56.811\nAnd even with my remote FX 3D\nvideo adapter is not available,\n\n343\n00:20:56.811 --> 00:21:00.124\nyou can see its grayed out here for gen 1.\n\n344\n00:21:00.124 --> 00:21:01.617\nIts not an option.\n\n345\n00:21:01.617 --> 00:21:06.486\nWe'll talk about how we can set that\nup in an episode coming up soon.\n\n346\n00:21:06.486 --> 00:21:11.263\nBut looking over at our different options\nthat we have, you can see that my\n\n347\n00:21:11.263 --> 00:21:16.363\ncomports are over here on my left for\nthe gen 1 along with that diskette drive.\n\n348\n00:21:16.363 --> 00:21:19.372\nThere are just a lot of\ndifferences between the gen 1 and\n\n349\n00:21:19.372 --> 00:21:23.470\ngen 2 like I was talking about earlier\nto help you make that decision.\n\n350\n00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.360\nAnd ultimately, I think just get in\nthere and play around with it and\n\n351\n00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.100\nthat's how you're really gonna learn and\nknow the differences between those.\n\n352\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.519\nI do wanna talk about something that\nwe chose when we were setting up\n\n353\n00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:39.777\nour gen 2 machine and\nthat was going to be our memory, and\n\n354\n00:21:39.777 --> 00:21:43.258\nwe had selected to enable\nour dynamic memory.\n\n355\n00:21:43.258 --> 00:21:47.180\nSo if I uncheck that and\nyou can just see what happens,\n\n356\n00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.718\nthis section becomes grayed out.\n\n357\n00:21:49.718 --> 00:21:54.591\nSo if I enabled dynamic memory,\nthen I have some additional options.\n\n358\n00:21:54.591 --> 00:21:58.430\nSo with our generation one machine,\nlet me go back in time over here.\n\n359\n00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.919\nWe're time traveling right now, Wes.\n\n360\n00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:00.579\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n361\n00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:01.657\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n362\n00:22:01.657 --> 00:22:04.675\nAnd so in gen 1,\nwe would have to actually power\n\n363\n00:22:04.675 --> 00:22:07.920\nthat VM down to change\nthe memory sizes like to add or\n\n364\n00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.532\nreduce that memory just like you would\nwith a regular physical machine.\n\n365\n00:22:12.532 --> 00:22:18.674\nBut here in gen 2, if I have dynamic\nmemory enabled, I don't have to do that.\n\n366\n00:22:18.674 --> 00:22:23.129\nNow I do have to power the machine\ndown in order to change between,\n\n367\n00:22:23.129 --> 00:22:25.889\nto enable or to disable dynamic memory.\n\n368\n00:22:25.889 --> 00:22:29.870\nBut once I have that enabled,\nthen I should be good to go.\n\n369\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.874\nNow, [COUGH] startup RAM.\n\n370\n00:22:32.874 --> 00:22:35.782\nThis is the amount of RAM that\nI had assigned originally,\n\n371\n00:22:35.782 --> 00:22:37.460\nbut I could modify that.\n\n372\n00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.490\nSo sometimes,\n\n373\n00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:43.200\nmachines are gonna take additional\nRAM whenever we are powering them up.\n\n374\n00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.225\nSo, I may wanna allocate a little\nbit more for that initial startup.\n\n375\n00:22:47.225 --> 00:22:52.969\nAnd if I'm familiar with that machine,\nif I've been monitoring it and\n\n376\n00:22:52.969 --> 00:22:57.562\nI know that it is just kind of\nplateauing at a lower level,\n\n377\n00:22:57.562 --> 00:23:01.200\nthen I can reduce that\nminimum amount of RAM,\n\n378\n00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.728\nso that I can use a concept\nwhere I'm sharing my memory.\n\n379\n00:23:05.728 --> 00:23:09.143\nSo think about, remember, we're pulling\nour memory from a physical machine.\n\n380\n00:23:09.143 --> 00:23:12.507\nWe're talking about one virtual machine,\nbut\n\n381\n00:23:12.507 --> 00:23:17.477\nI might be sharing that physical\nmachine with 100 other machines.\n\n382\n00:23:17.477 --> 00:23:20.700\nSo if I'm not using that memory,\nthen why don't I share?\n\n383\n00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.723\nBecause sharing is caring and I can\nallow another machine to go ahead, and\n\n384\n00:23:23.723 --> 00:23:24.466\nuse that memory.\n\n385\n00:23:24.466 --> 00:23:29.844\nI can also specify the maximum amount of\nram that I would ever want this particular\n\n386\n00:23:29.844 --> 00:23:35.003\nmachine to have at any given time and\nthen I can also specify my memory buffer.\n\n387\n00:23:35.003 --> 00:23:38.711\nSo for instance,\nif I'm using a gig of memory,\n\n388\n00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:45.180\nmy buffer would be sitting there at\n1.2 gigs here at 20% is the default.\n\n389\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.603\nYou can change that, if you need to.\n\n390\n00:23:48.603 --> 00:23:53.108\nNow, what that does is it just kinda helps\nyou in the moment of memory contentions.\n\n391\n00:23:53.108 --> 00:23:55.065\nSo if you do ever find\nyourself needing that,\n\n392\n00:23:55.065 --> 00:23:58.319\nthen you have a little bit of buffers,\nso that the machine doesn't crash.\n\n393\n00:23:58.319 --> 00:24:01.575\nBecause sometimes you could find\nyourself Like we spoke about before,\n\n394\n00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:03.539\nvirtual machines love the memory, Phil.\n\n395\n00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:06.960\nLet's make sure we have enough of it,\nand it's allocated accordingly.\n\n396\n00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's what I would think of,\nCherokee, first of all,\n\n397\n00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.820\nis that,\nif we are sharing memory like that, and\n\n398\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:16.930\nyou have these kind of thresholds that you\ncan set, well, what would stop one VM?\n\n399\n00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.433\nIf I need that virtual machine,\nI just need it.\n\n400\n00:24:20.433 --> 00:24:23.937\nBut maybe some of the other virtual\nmachines that I have aren't really so\n\n401\n00:24:23.937 --> 00:24:24.980\nmuch of a necessity.\n\n402\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.926\nHow can I kind of ensure that hey, when\nthat VM is on at a certain point that it\n\n403\n00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:32.953\nis going to make sure that I have this\nkind of memory ready to go when I need it?\n\n404\n00:24:32.953 --> 00:24:36.814\nSo that I don't get like a memory\nexhaustion on one of these machines that\n\n405\n00:24:36.814 --> 00:24:40.655\nmight run from time to time into\nvery memory intensive operations.\n\n406\n00:24:40.655 --> 00:24:41.895\n&gt;&gt; Sure, well, that's a great question.\n\n407\n00:24:41.895 --> 00:24:44.185\nIt's valid and it does happen,\nmost definitely.\n\n408\n00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:47.501\nSo what we can do actually,\nit's right in that same section there.\n\n409\n00:24:47.501 --> 00:24:50.158\nI don't know if my head's\nkind of covering it.\n\n410\n00:24:50.158 --> 00:24:54.209\nBut if you see right here, there's\na sliding option where it starts over on\n\n411\n00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:58.900\nthe left-hand side from low to high, and\nthat section is called memory weight.\n\n412\n00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.119\nSo if I wanted to grant\nyou a higher priority,\n\n413\n00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:06.634\nthen I can give you a higher\nweight on that particular machine.\n\n414\n00:25:06.634 --> 00:25:10.260\nAnd basically saying, you're more\nimportant, give you the higher precedence.\n\n415\n00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.087\nSo that if there was that\ncontention occurring in that event,\n\n416\n00:25:14.087 --> 00:25:18.516\nthen the system would know where it\nshould allocate that memory first.\n\n417\n00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:22.977\nAnd then kind of go in this\nlittle triage here, so yeah.\n\n418\n00:25:22.977 --> 00:25:26.040\nI'm looking at the clock here.\n\n419\n00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.813\nI don't know if I have enough time to\nshow you how to change that in PowerShell\n\n420\n00:25:30.813 --> 00:25:35.890\nbecause there is syntax where you can\nchange all the dynamic memory components,\n\n421\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.669\nset the minimum and maximum in PowerShell.\n\n422\n00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:39.310\nBut you know what?\n\n423\n00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.251\nI'll just go ahead and\nadd that in the show notes for\n\n424\n00:25:41.251 --> 00:25:43.117\nyou because it does look\nlike we're out of time.\n\n425\n00:25:43.117 --> 00:25:46.782\nBut I think we've got a good start on\nhow to create that machine in the GUI,\n\n426\n00:25:46.782 --> 00:25:49.650\nwhat's the difference between gen one and\ngen two.\n\n427\n00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.920\nAnd we'll come back and take a look at\nhow to create a machine in PowerShell and\n\n428\n00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.490\nadditional configurations.\n\n429\n00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.760\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nI love the cliffhangers, I always do.\n\n430\n00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.090\nI hate them when it's in a movie and\n\n431\n00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.230\nI just paid a whole bunch of\nmoney to go to the movies.\n\n432\n00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:03.035\nBut here it's a little bit different\ncuz we always have the time to go into\n\n433\n00:26:03.035 --> 00:26:03.950\na part two.\n\n434\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.450\nNow Cherokee, like you said, it looks\nlike our time is just about to the end.\n\n435\n00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.585\nBut before we go, do you have any\nadditional maybe piece of advice you might\n\n436\n00:26:11.585 --> 00:26:14.070\nwanna give somebody if it comes\nto creating virtual machines?\n\n437\n00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.810\nOr are we gonna leave them for\nthe next one?\n\n438\n00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:16.900\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n439\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.210\nI don't know if I'm supposed to remember\nanything else here in my notes.\n\n440\n00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.718\nI can't think of anything, Wes, but\nwe are just scratching the surface, and\n\n441\n00:26:23.718 --> 00:26:25.062\nthere's a lot more to cover.\n\n442\n00:26:25.062 --> 00:26:26.154\nSo I'm sure there'll be more.\n\n443\n00:26:26.154 --> 00:26:29.301\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's perfect, because we\ncan always come back in a part two or\n\n444\n00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:30.250\nin another episode.\n\n445\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.099\nThanks for being here.\n\n446\n00:26:31.099 --> 00:26:32.072\n&gt;&gt; Or a part five.\n\n447\n00:26:32.072 --> 00:26:33.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or part five.\n\n448\n00:26:33.777 --> 00:26:35.600\nThat's right, well,\nthanks for joining us here.\n\n449\n00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.290\nAnd thank you to the viewer for watching.\n\n450\n00:26:37.290 -->

00:00:12.220\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.440\n&gt;&gt; Hello to our viewers, welcome back to\nanother great episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.340\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n6\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.790\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series in 7410.\n\n7\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.940\nThat's right,\nthe MCSA in Window's Server 2012.\n\n8\n00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.720\nJoining us back in the studios is\nnon other than Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.740\nCherokee, how you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.400\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing amazing.\n\n11\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.180\nHow are you today Wes?\n\n12\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.830\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.430\nGreat to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.396\nYou know, in the last couple of episodes\nwe've talked pretty extensively about\n\n15\n00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:34.450\nvirtual machines, right?\n\n16\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.816\nWell that's because this whole little\nmini series that we're in really is about\n\n17\n00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:38.665\nHyper-V, right?\n\n18\n00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:40.620\nAnd the management of\nthose virtual machines.\n\n19\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.480\nNow if I remember right, in the last one,\nwe left on a little bit of\n\n20\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.630\na cliff hanger because we were doing a lot\nof things in the graphical user interface.\n\n21\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.428\nBut there's another way that Microsoft\ngives us to operate these, and\n\n22\n00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:51.836\nwork with these virtual machines.\n\n23\n00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:54.344\nAnd you're going to show us a little\nbit about that one in this episode\n\n24\n00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:55.140\ntoday, right?\n\n25\n00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.000\n&gt;&gt; You know it, Wes.\n\n26\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.980\nThey definitely wouldn't\nleave out Power Shell.\n\n27\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.030\nThat's their baby they've spent a lot\nof time developing and nurturing it.\n\n28\n00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.960\nSo they really wanna us as\nadministrators to go ahead and\n\n29\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.030\ntake advantage of that,\nand why wouldn't it?\n\n30\n00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.900\nI mean, it's a great way to just\nmake ourselves more efficient,\n\n31\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690\nonce we go ahead and\nget comfortable with it.\n\n32\n00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.375\nSo that's what we're here today, to do.\n\n33\n00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:19.738\nAnd this show will go ahead and\nshow you how to acclimate yourself and\n\n34\n00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:20.980\nuse Power Shell.\n\n35\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.610\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee is this like a lot of the\nother roles that you have inside of your\n\n36\n00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.940\nserver operating system?\n\n37\n00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.002\nWhere, you know if you are in Power Shell,\n\n38\n00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:30.912\nyou might not have that functionality\njust natively built into the Power Shell.\n\n39\n00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:34.146\nAnd where you have to add different\ncomponents to the Power Shell To be able\n\n40\n00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:37.400\nto work with that role is that something\nthat we are gonna see here as well?\n\n41\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.030\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's a great question.\n\n42\n00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.480\nActually, because if you were just to\npull up a server machine without actually\n\n43\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.960\nhaving that Hyper-V module there,\nthen you wouldn't have access to these.\n\n44\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.510\nBut, because in the previous show,\n\n45\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.490\nwe did include that Hyper-V role,\nPowerShell has all of those Hyper-V\n\n46\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.720\ncommandlets integrated in\n&gt;&gt; And I don't know which, how many\n\n47\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.740\nexactly there are now, but I know when\nit first came out, there was like 160.\n\n48\n00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.486\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So, there's quite a bit of commandlets\n\n49\n00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:06.350\nassociated and used just for Hyper V here.\n\n50\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.850\nSo, I would definitely encourage you\nall to see what we're doing here.\n\n51\n00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.610\nAnd then, just play with it on your own.\n\n52\n00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.510\nBecause you really just need to\nget in there and see how it works.\n\n53\n00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.170\n&gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, so\nwhat we'll be doing here today,\n\n54\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.400\nyou might be doing something different, or\nyour brain thinks differently than mine.\n\n55\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.610\nThat's okay, because one of the cool\nthings about PowerShell is that\n\n56\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.330\nmodular design,\nwhere you can take components and\n\n57\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.730\nkind of piece them together like a puzzle,\nto get the output that you desire.\n\n58\n00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.520\nSo if you see something I do, hey,\nthere might be a better way to do it.\n\n59\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.940\nI try to stick with a lot of\nthe defaults that you may see for\n\n60\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.570\nfuture sit down and thinking type\npurposes, if that makes sense to you.\n\n61\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.470\nOtherwise, if you're in\na working environment,\n\n62\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.430\nyou could do it however you want really,\nso that's why playing around is the best.\n\n63\n00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.250\nSo why don't we, first I will go ahead and\nshow PowerShell here,\n\n64\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.620\nI already have it pulled up.\n\n65\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.180\nAnd what I wanna do is I\nwanna show the different\n\n66\n00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.040\ntypes of commands that are available.\n\n67\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.628\nSo if we just type in get-command,\nif I'm typing,\n\n68\n00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:16.712\ngive me a second here,\nI do that every time Wes.\n\n69\n00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:22.211\n[LAUGH] All right so get command this\nis gonna be -module and hyper -v.\n\n70\n00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:28.820\nAnd what we're gonna be looking here is\nto take the output of these two commands.\n\n71\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.750\nAnd we're gonna pipe that on in to display\nthis information in an out dash grid view.\n\n72\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.180\nAnd what that does for us is provide kind\nof like a just an easy searchable, so you\n\n73\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.820\ncan go through and see all the different\ncommandlets that are associated here.\n\n74\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.720\nYou can just go ahead and use this filter\nto really narrow them down if you're\n\n75\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.430\ntrying to find a specific function\nthat you wanted to execute.\n\n76\n00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.030\nSo like I said just getting in there,\n\n77\n00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.500\ngetting the practice is really how\nyou're going to learn all those.\n\n78\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.890\nWe still do see that verb noun syntax so\n\n79\n00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.470\nyou would definitely\nbe familiar with that.\n\n80\n00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.820\nAnd just playing around.\n\n81\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.880\nBut there's also documentation on the web.\n\n82\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.410\nSo if that's not enough help for\n\n83\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.200\nyou something you can do here\nis hop on over to Tech Med.\n\n84\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.210\nI've included the links\nin the show notes so\n\n85\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.290\nyou have that and again, you can just\nreally dig through each one of these.\n\n86\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.742\nAnd there's a description\nthat'll go ahead and explain.\n\n87\n00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:33.840\nI'm gonna scroll down, were going to be\nstarting with the new VM if I can find it.\n\n88\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.360\nThere it is right here.\n\n89\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.870\nAnd, basically, you can see here that\nit creates a new virtual machine.\n\n90\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.100\nIf you click on the hyperlink,\nit's pretty cool.\n\n91\n00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.780\nMicrosoft, here,\nwill provide different syntax examples.\n\n92\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.923\nSo you can see, you know, exactly what you\nwould need to be using and typing out.\n\n93\n00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:54.666\nAnd of course, you would fill this in\nwith the information that you wanted to.\n\n94\n00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:59.107\nBut it's pretty cool because you can\nsee just how to be familiar with this,\n\n95\n00:04:59.107 --> 00:05:02.650\nif you're not, and\nyou know how to go ahead and set that up.\n\n96\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.850\nAll right, so let's go back into\nPowerShell and start with a machine here.\n\n97\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.035\nSo for this one, lets see,\nlets just type in new -VM and -name.\n\n98\n00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:20.578\nI'm trying to think what\nare we going to name this one?\n\n99\n00:05:20.578 --> 00:05:23.960\nThis one we'll go ahead and name Server01.\n\n100\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.970\nAnd before we set the memory in\nthe graphical user interface, but\n\n101\n00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.890\nwe're just doing that here.\n\n102\n00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.440\nAnd you know there's even,\nif I can even spell correctly,\n\n103\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.250\nthere's all kinds of command lights\nassociated even with the dynamic memory in\n\n104\n00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.820\nsetting those maximum limits and\neverything.\n\n105\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.332\nSo, for our memory here, let's just\ngo ahead and do the start up bytes.\n\n106\n00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:53.171\nAnd for our start up bytes we'll\ntype in one gigabyte here, and\n\n107\n00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:58.260\nyou can use different units of measurement\nlike megabytes or whatever you choose.\n\n108\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.900\nJust remember to go ahead and\nadd append with that abbrevaition there.\n\n109\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.471\nAnd then, we'll go ahead and\nspecify our disk size here, so new VHD.\n\n110\n00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:15.433\nAnd this is going to be maybe to the size,\nlet's auto tab that.\n\n111\n00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:20.340\nIf I spell,\n\n112\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.430\nthat's going to be the big thing\nhere is my typing here so, I see.\n\n113\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.190\nI have an underscore,\nwhy my other tab is not going through?\n\n114\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.040\nBut you can use autotab.\n\n115\n00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.748\nAnd I normally don't like to use autotab,\nbut\n\n116\n00:06:32.748 --> 00:06:35.810\nI don't want you guys to\nsee me suffer through this.\n\n117\n00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.574\nSo if I go ahead and\nend in the correct syntax, and\n\n118\n00:06:38.574 --> 00:06:40.425\nif I know the first few letters.\n\n119\n00:06:40.425 --> 00:06:45.182\nAnd I'll say new VHD and then I can\ntab through, it's not the path but\n\n120\n00:06:45.182 --> 00:06:49.119\nit's gonna be the size in bytes,\nso I'll just specify,\n\n121\n00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:53.170\nalthough it says bytes,\nI'll just say Gigabytes.\n\n122\n00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.310\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n123\n00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.040\nNow, what it's gonna ask me for\n\n124\n00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.180\nis to specify a path to link\nback to a VHD or VHDX file.\n\n125\n00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.230\nI have a couple sitting on my D drive,\nso that's where we'll go ahead and\n\n126\n00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.580\nnavigate to right now.\n\n127\n00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.620\nSo I'm just gonna type in D:/.\n\n128\n00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.860\nAnd by default, Hyper View will go ahead\nand put that in a folder called VHD.\n\n129\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.340\nSo this is my VHD file.\n\n130\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.580\nAnd my VHD, and then the name of\nmy machine here is going to be,\n\n131\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:30.080\nthat was server01, and that was .vhdx.\n\n132\n00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.740\nWe'll hit enter.\n\n133\n00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:33.670\nAll right.\n\n134\n00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.680\nAnd so, we've just created a machine.\n\n135\n00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.130\nPretty simple, pretty easy.\n\n136\n00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.626\nWe can really add additional values and\nparameters, if we choose to do so as well.\n\n137\n00:07:41.626 --> 00:07:47.401\nBut just for taking a look at how\nto execute this functionality wise,\n\n138\n00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:48.503\nthat's it.\n\n139\n00:07:48.503 --> 00:07:52.651\nNow, there's another way that we can\nutilize PowerShell, but a different type\n\n140\n00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:56.262\nof PowerShell, so I'm just gonna go\nahead and minimize this for now.\n\n141\n00:07:56.262 --> 00:07:59.896\nI don't think we've really\ntalked too much about ISE,\n\n142\n00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:03.452\nintegrated scripting environment,\nwhich is an IDE,\n\n143\n00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:09.650\nan integrated development environment,\nthat Server 2012 and 2012 R2 offer.\n\n144\n00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.370\nNow let me see,\nI know it's a little small for you, but\n\n145\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.140\nthere are two panes here,\nin the integrated scripting environment.\n\n146\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.913\nAnd actually in order to go ahead and\njust navigate here all I did.\n\n147\n00:08:22.913 --> 00:08:25.877\nThere are a couple of different\nways to get to different locations,\n\n148\n00:08:25.877 --> 00:08:27.600\njust as with anything in Microsoft.\n\n149\n00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.430\nBut if you go ahead and\npull up the run bar.\n\n150\n00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.421\nAnd I'll zoom in for you.\n\n151\n00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:43.200\nI just typed in powershell_ise.exe and\nthat's how I got to this location.\n\n152\n00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.520\nI know that was kind of fast there for\nyou, but there it is.\n\n153\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.564\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nclose out of there.\n\n154\n00:08:49.564 --> 00:08:54.054\nAnd by default, the second window isn't\ndisplayed, but what you can do is just\n\n155\n00:08:54.054 --> 00:08:58.020\nclick on this little arrow and\nit'll go ahead and pull it down for you.\n\n156\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.190\nSo that's how you may see it,\nlogging in the default way.\n\n157\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.100\nBut to get that extra script area,\nyou just hit that down arrow.\n\n158\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.540\nAnd what that does for\nus is it really delineates and\n\n159\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.280\nbreaks down by on a per line basis for\nthe script here.\n\n160\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.910\nAnd a couple different ways.\n\n161\n00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.270\nLike if you didn't want to go ahead and\nrun it, because when you type\n\n162\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.650\nit into PowerShell and hit Enter,\nit'll go ahead and run or execute.\n\n163\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.120\nA little bit differently here,\nyou can run it from this top pane, but\n\n164\n00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:32.180\nyou would just have to either, this button\nright here will say run this selection.\n\n165\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.750\nSo if you wanted to just run a small\npiece, a chunk of that script,\n\n166\n00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.880\nyou could do that.\n\n167\n00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.830\nOr you could also run this script but\nyou would have to highlight it as well.\n\n168\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.770\nSo it just depends.\n\n169\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.210\n&gt;&gt; So if I wanted to do just like you\nsaid, I wanna test each individual piece.\n\n170\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.543\nOr maybe I notice that I'm checking error\nlogs and a piece of that is breaking and\n\n171\n00:09:51.543 --> 00:09:52.686\nit says error at this line,\n\n172\n00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:55.696\nnow I can actually count the lines\ncuz I know that PowerShell does that.\n\n173\n00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:57.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It says check out this line, and\n\n174\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.079\nI'm going back counting all the lines.\n\n175\n00:09:58.079 --> 00:09:59.100\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like, wait, what.\n\n176\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.140\n&gt;&gt; Right, so this makes it easy.\n\n177\n00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.046\nYou can actually see which lines are and\n\n178\n00:10:02.046 --> 00:10:04.490\nthen run an individual\nline within the script.\n\n179\n00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah most definitely, Wes.\n\n180\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.207\nAnd for this one, you can see I\nhaven't really named it anything\n\n181\n00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:10.025\nspecial over here on this side, this tab.\n\n182\n00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:12.187\nBut if you are able to\ntroubleshoot your script and\n\n183\n00:10:12.187 --> 00:10:14.876\nyou found where that error was and\nyou were able to correct it.\n\n184\n00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:17.660\nAnd you're like this is perfect,\nI don't want to have this issue again.\n\n185\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.414\nThen ISE will allow you to save it so\n\n186\n00:10:19.414 --> 00:10:24.390\nthat you don't have to try to recreate\nthat particular script every single time.\n\n187\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.310\nPretty cool.\n\n188\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.160\nSo either way I can copy and\n\n189\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.900\npaste that down in here as well or\njust run it from here.\n\n190\n00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.960\nDoesn't matter actually,\nwe'll just do the Run Selected here.\n\n191\n00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.360\nAnd you can see, ooh that was pretty fast,\nI don't know if you saw that, but\n\n192\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.730\nit actually did run it and\ncreate that machine here.\n\n193\n00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.780\nAnd so I just specified some\ninformation here, like the location,\n\n194\n00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.900\nthe name of the machine, you can see,\nServer02, and that was it.\n\n195\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.219\nI mean, yeah, you have to type it\nout to get it set up originally but\n\n196\n00:10:57.219 --> 00:11:01.559\nonce you save that, really all you\nhave to do is come in and change.\n\n197\n00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:04.846\nFor this particular script just\nchange the name of that machine,\n\n198\n00:11:04.846 --> 00:11:08.923\nbecause there's even a variable here where\nwe set the variable for the VM names.\n\n199\n00:11:08.923 --> 00:11:11.855\nSo you wouldn't even have to change\nthat because down here when it says\n\n200\n00:11:11.855 --> 00:11:12.506\nthe location.\n\n201\n00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:17.150\nObviously that VHDX would have to be in\nthe C drive, but you wouldn't even have to\n\n202\n00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.659\nrename it every time if you put all those\nVHDX files sitting there on your C drive\n\n203\n00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:25.510\nor wherever you choose to put them and\nthen place that in the path.\n\n204\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.100\nSo pretty cool.\n\n205\n00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.530\nTwo different ways to use\nPowerShell to go ahead and\n\n206\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:33.270\ncreate machines additionally to what\nwe saw right here within the GUI.\n\n207\n00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.666\nSo either way you choose to do that.\n\n208\n00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:39.235\n&gt;&gt; And I've seen that on different\nMicrosoft exams, where they've said hey,\n\n209\n00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:42.455\nwe want you to do this but\nwe don't want you to do it in 15 steps,\n\n210\n00:11:42.455 --> 00:11:45.045\nwe want you to do it with the least\namount of administrative effort.\n\n211\n00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:47.858\nSo I can see where something like\nthe integrated scripting environment,\n\n212\n00:11:47.858 --> 00:11:50.715\nit's gonna be the least amount of\nadministrative effort [LAUGH] When you can\n\n213\n00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:52.580\njust put one of those scripts in place.\n\n214\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.860\nYou set it and then you can walk away\nfrom it, rather than having to manually\n\n215\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.860\nenter that line by line every time that\nyou're actually going to create a VM.\n\n216\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.860\n&gt;&gt; That is most definitely the case Wes.\n\n217\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.690\nThere are certain keywords.\n\n218\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.562\nAnd with a lot different vendors and\n\n219\n00:12:05.562 --> 00:12:09.818\nexam certifications out there that you\nhave to pay attention to those keywords.\n\n220\n00:12:09.818 --> 00:12:13.041\nLeast administrative effort or\nany kind of really least.\n\n221\n00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:17.169\nWhen they talk about maybe\nit's not as expensive,\n\n222\n00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:22.380\nor the least amount of waste or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n223\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.870\nAnd getting familiar with\nPowerShell is a really\n\n224\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.120\ngreat way where we can reduce\nany kind of waste like that.\n\n225\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.126\nAlso let me just pull up this screen here.\n\n226\n00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:35.398\nAnd it's kind of a little more deep\nthan you may be familiar with,\n\n227\n00:12:35.398 --> 00:12:37.436\ntalking about logical operators here.\n\n228\n00:12:37.436 --> 00:12:38.977\nBut the reason I wanna show you this is so\n\n229\n00:12:38.977 --> 00:12:42.490\nthat you know where to go to find this\nadditional and supplemental information.\n\n230\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.630\nWe also have PowerShell shows.\n\n231\n00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.730\nI know Mike's done some,\nI think Don's done some.\n\n232\n00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.988\nSo we definitely have those in our course\nlibrary as well, to just take a look at\n\n233\n00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:56.439\nhow to use PowerShell because that's gonna\nbe such a helpful tool with you that you\n\n234\n00:12:56.439 --> 00:13:00.717\ncan take with you for your career,\nbecause it's not going away any time soon.\n\n235\n00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:03.444\n[LAUGH] So, why I wanted to show you this,\n\n236\n00:13:03.444 --> 00:13:07.067\nwe'll be using some of\nthese comparison operators.\n\n237\n00:13:07.067 --> 00:13:08.601\nAnd if I scroll down,\n\n238\n00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:14.486\nthis just kind of shows you different\ntypes of operators like Boolean operators,\n\n239\n00:13:14.486 --> 00:13:19.920\nwe can do or, if, than parameters,\nand or XORing or exclusive ors.\n\n240\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.840\nBut the one I wanna show you, let's see,\nfor our comparison operators here.\n\n241\n00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.420\nSo if you've never seen these before.\n\n242\n00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.860\nAnd I'm typing them out, and you're like,\nwell, what the heck is Cherokee typing?\n\n243\n00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.553\nWell, this is where I'm getting\nthis information, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:34.553 --> 00:13:39.352\nSo for my -eq, that means equals,\nlike equals, and\n\n245\n00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:44.698\nthen you can also use less than,\ngreater than, so gt, lt.\n\n246\n00:13:44.698 --> 00:13:48.898\nSo just to kind of get an idea and\na feel for where you could go ahead and\n\n247\n00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:50.466\nfind those components.\n\n248\n00:13:50.466 --> 00:13:52.568\nAll right, so let's use them.\n\n249\n00:13:52.568 --> 00:13:56.642\nLet me pull PowerShell back up here and\njust clear the screen.\n\n250\n00:13:56.642 --> 00:13:57.983\nWhat do we wanna do here?\n\n251\n00:13:57.983 --> 00:14:00.463\nOkay, so\nright now the machine that I'm on,\n\n252\n00:14:00.463 --> 00:14:03.157\nI'm actually on the machine\nrunning Hyper-V.\n\n253\n00:14:03.157 --> 00:14:06.614\nSo I have everything already set up,\ninstalled.\n\n254\n00:14:06.614 --> 00:14:08.980\nActually let me just minimize that so\nyou can see that.\n\n255\n00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.800\nI'll go ahead and\npull up my Hyper-V Manager.\n\n256\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.610\nOkay, so\nI have some virtual machines right here.\n\n257\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.678\nNone of them area actually on,\nso let me just put a couple on.\n\n258\n00:14:21.678 --> 00:14:23.227\nWe'll say Connect.\n\n259\n00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:25.840\nAnd then just turn on our\ndomain controller here.\n\n260\n00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.790\nThat should be good for now.\n\n261\n00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.827\nI just kind of want to give\nsome variations there.\n\n262\n00:14:30.827 --> 00:14:33.386\nWe may be using that in a moment.\n\n263\n00:14:33.386 --> 00:14:35.506\nAll right, so let's pull back PowerShell.\n\n264\n00:14:35.506 --> 00:14:38.568\nNow, we're gonna be using a command here.\n\n265\n00:14:38.568 --> 00:14:43.730\nThis is going to be a command that will\nreturn machines that are powered on.\n\n266\n00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.342\nAnd you'll get to see how we can\nuse that comparison operator here.\n\n267\n00:14:47.342 --> 00:14:52.711\nSo we'll say Get-vm and then we'll\ntake the output of that command and\n\n268\n00:14:52.711 --> 00:14:55.231\npipe it into something, where.\n\n269\n00:14:55.231 --> 00:15:03.888\nAnd then we'll use our curly brackets to\ndeclare a variable here for our variable.\n\n270\n00:15:03.888 --> 00:15:06.860\nIt's going to be where the state\nis going to be equal to, so eq.\n\n271\n00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.148\nAnd we'll go ahead and say off.\n\n272\n00:15:11.148 --> 00:15:16.472\nAnd, oops, I used a double quote, so we'll\ngo ahead and put a single quote here.\n\n273\n00:15:16.472 --> 00:15:22.374\nAnd don't forget to end that curly bracket\nthere, you always have to do that.\n\n274\n00:15:22.374 --> 00:15:23.870\nAnd we'll hit Enter.\n\n275\n00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.650\nAnd you can see in a table format\n\n276\n00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.490\nthat the operating system was able\nto provide that information to me.\n\n277\n00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.714\nThe hypervisor was able to say hey look,\nthese are the virtual machines that you\n\n278\n00:15:34.714 --> 00:15:37.360\nhave on this system that\nare in an off state.\n\n279\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.938\nAnd it's really simple to go ahead and\nchange that value here, instead of off.\n\n280\n00:15:42.938 --> 00:15:48.974\nYou'd think it would say on but that's not\nthe case here, it's going to be running.\n\n281\n00:15:48.974 --> 00:15:54.004\nAll right, so if we just go ahead and\nhit running, we can see PLABDCO1,\n\n282\n00:15:54.004 --> 00:15:57.469\nthat domain controller\nthat we just turned on so,\n\n283\n00:15:57.469 --> 00:16:01.839\nThis can be helpful in a crunch,\njust to go ahead and set those,\n\n284\n00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:06.070\ndeclare those aliases and\nset those comparison operators.\n\n285\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.322\nAlso, if I wanted to,\nI'm not gonna do this right now, but\n\n286\n00:16:12.322 --> 00:16:17.205\nI could, let's say,\ntake the output of this last command.\n\n287\n00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:20.952\nI could also pipe that into something\nwhere, hey, maybe I wanna shut down,\n\n288\n00:16:20.952 --> 00:16:23.840\npower down or power on my machines,\nI could also go ahead.\n\n289\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.936\nSince this one is running,\nwe could just say stop,\n\n290\n00:16:28.936 --> 00:16:32.380\nand then go ahead and type in -VM.\n\n291\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.648\nAnd then that would be a quick way, oops,\nnot with a bracket there, all right,\n\n292\n00:16:36.648 --> 00:16:40.852\nto go ahead and say, hey, I'm gonna go\nahead and power up all of the machines or\n\n293\n00:16:40.852 --> 00:16:42.480\npower down all the machines.\n\n294\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.740\nAnd you could also selectively choose one\nwhere you add the name parameter also.\n\n295\n00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.150\nSo a couple different ways\nyou could use that there.\n\n296\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.880\nLet's see, I kinda wanna pull this\ndown a little bit and clear it off so\n\n297\n00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.370\nwe can see what we're doing here,\ngive ourselves a little bit of space.\n\n298\n00:17:04.853 --> 00:17:08.346\nDon't mind me.\n\n299\n00:17:08.346 --> 00:17:12.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, all right, so\n\n300\n00:17:12.842 --> 00:17:14.890\nas long as we can see.\n\n301\n00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.850\nIt might be a little bit difficult to see,\nbut I kinda wanna have both of these\n\n302\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.575\nwindows up so you can see what's\nhappening in the background as well.\n\n303\n00:17:20.575 --> 00:17:25.300\nWes, we kind of mentioned,\nwe were talking about snapshots,\n\n304\n00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.810\ncheckpoints, whatever you wanna call them\nnowadays, and how helpful they can be.\n\n305\n00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.580\nSo yes, we can create them in\nthe graphical user interface, but\n\n306\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.800\nI also wanted to just show you how we can\ncreate them here in PowerShell as well.\n\n307\n00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.710\nPretty helpful tool.\n\n308\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.420\nSo what we'll do is we'll type get-VM.\n\n309\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.561\nAnd here, we'll go ahead and\nspecify the name for this machine.\n\n310\n00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:46.698\nAnd we'll just use PLABDC01,\n\n311\n00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:51.220\nsince that one is the one that\nwe have powered on right now.\n\n312\n00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.630\nAnd we'll take the output of that, so once\nwe get that machine, we'll go ahead and\n\n313\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.962\npipe that into a checkpoint.\n\n314\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.670\nAnd checkpoint-VM.\n\n315\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.602\nWe need to name, and it's kind of funny.\n\n316\n00:18:03.602 --> 00:18:08.417\nActually, in this syntax, they combined\nboth the different names here, so\n\n317\n00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:13.168\nyou'll see checkpoint, and\nthen we actually give it a -snapshot name.\n\n318\n00:18:13.168 --> 00:18:13.865\n&gt;&gt; That's not confusing.\n\n319\n00:18:13.865 --> 00:18:16.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Never, they never are.\n\n320\n00:18:16.355 --> 00:18:20.650\nSo something that I like\nto do with my snapshots,\n\n321\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:25.020\nI always like to include the month,\nthe date.\n\n322\n00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.970\nAnd then kind of like, hey,\nwhy are you creating this snapshot?\n\n323\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.220\nSo maybe I'm gonna name this one update,\nand then kb.\n\n324\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.000\nSo if it was a particular kb number for\nthat update, I would go ahead and\n\n325\n00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.540\nput that in here.\n\n326\n00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.880\nAnd whatever kind of month/date\nformat that your company uses,\n\n327\n00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.590\nit might be the day, month, whatever.\n\n328\n00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:49.340\nWe'll just hit Enter here, and it'll\ngo ahead and generate that checkpoint.\n\n329\n00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.780\nAnd you can see right\nhere in the background,\n\n330\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.040\nthat's what I wanted you to see,\n\n331\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.410\nthat that checkpoint is\nactually being generated there.\n\n332\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:59.080\nSo if we were to check on that,\nyou just click on the machine,\n\n333\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.040\nand then your checkpoints are listed here.\n\n334\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.310\nAnd sometimes It's kinda\nfolded up like that.\n\n335\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.520\nAnd you would just need to, oops,\nright behind me, hit that arrow there, and\n\n336\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.340\nthen right here.\n\n337\n00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.270\nAnd you could see that,\n\n338\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.060\nhey, look, this is that particular\ncheckpoint that we just created.\n\n339\n00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.620\nThat I could revert to it if,\nfor whatever reason,\n\n340\n00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.530\nthat update were to crash my system or\nsomething like that.\n\n341\n00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.284\n&gt;&gt; And would you recommend that if\nyou do have a naming convention,\n\n342\n00:19:22.284 --> 00:19:25.395\ncuz you mentioned the way you like to\nname it, and that keeps it in check.\n\n343\n00:19:25.395 --> 00:19:29.280\nCheckpoint, all pun intended right here,\nhall of blame here.\n\n344\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.451\nWhatever naming convention you start with,\njust keep it consistent so\n\n345\n00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:32.763\nyou can come back and see what's going on.\n\n346\n00:19:32.763 --> 00:19:35.150\n&gt;&gt; So we're in the United States,\nand it's pretty common.\n\n347\n00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.259\nA lot of Americans will type it like this,\nbut in all the other parts of the world,\n\n348\n00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:41.200\nthey go ahead and use it the other way.\n\n349\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.019\nAnd in a lot of programming languages,\nyou'll see it that way, too, so yeah,\n\n350\n00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:47.590\nit just depends, and\nthen stay consistent, right?\n\n351\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n352\n00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.500\n&gt;&gt; Now, that was it for\nthis particular show, Wes.\n\n353\n00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.550\nI just wanted to really round out how to\ngo ahead and get those machines up and\n\n354\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.270\nrunning, those virtual machines.\n\n355\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.530\nBut we still have a lot of configuration\nto do, so I think we'll come back and\n\n356\n00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.260\nshow that in the next shows.\n\n357\n00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good,\na lot of great information.\n\n358\n00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.160\nI know I love PowerShell.\n\n359\n00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.780\nWe hope you like PowerShell out there.\n\n360\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.243\nAnd keep in mind, it's not necessarily\nthat they're gonna want you to know every\n\n361\n00:20:10.243 --> 00:20:11.155\ncommand on the exam.\n\n362\n00:20:11.155 --> 00:20:14.257\nBut they're definitely gonna want you\nto know what Cherokee's showing you.\n\n363\n00:20:14.257 --> 00:20:17.260\nAnd then some of those basic commands,\ncommandlets, I guess we should say.\n\n364\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.750\nGet them under your belt so\nthat you'll pass that 7410 exam.\n\n365\n00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.110\nNow, it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n366\n00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.890\nBut before we do, any final words\nthat maybe you'd like to impart to\n\n367\n00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.490\nthe viewers when it comes to using\nPowerShell and working with Hyper-V?\n\n368\n00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:29.810\n&gt;&gt; Can I give them\nanother cliffhanger here?\n\n369\n00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:30.854\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you can.\n\n370\n00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:32.814\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I tell you what, we'll go ahead and\n\n371\n00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:34.440\nwe'll end it right there then.\n\n372\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.040\nAnd you'll just have to stick\naround here and come back and\n\n373\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.320\nsee some of the other shows.\n\n374\n00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.660\nCherokee, we appreciate,\nas always, you being here.\n\n375\n00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.540\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Wes.\n\n376\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.620\n&gt;&gt; And we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n377\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.140\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n378\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.000\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n379\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.925\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n380\n00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:53.450\n[MUSIC]\n\n381\n00:20:53.450 -->

you live from [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:07.953\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.953 --> 00:00:11.835\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:14.781\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome back to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.720\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n8\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.060\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series in the 70-410 exam.\n\n9\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.770\nThat's right, the MCSA and\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n10\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.610\nAnd joining us back in the studio is\nnone other than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.590\nCherokee, how you doing today?\n\n12\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.160\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.870\nHow are you?\n\n14\n00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.510\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n15\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.340\nWonderful to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.740\nSo we've been looking at things\nlike our virtualization services,\n\n17\n00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.370\nmore specifically Hyper-V.\n\n18\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.580\nAnd you've taken us through a pretty good\ngamut of just different things that we can\n\n19\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.890\ndo with our virtual machines.\n\n20\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.980\nWhat are we looking at in this episode?\n\n21\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.046\n&gt;&gt; So I think now we should really start\nfocusing on configuring our virtual\n\n22\n00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:46.850\nmachines.\n\n23\n00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.960\nThere are a lot of different\noptions that we have.\n\n24\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.320\nAnd like we talked about before,\nvirtualization really has come a long way.\n\n25\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.090\nSo let's not leverage and take\nadvantage of all those great features.\n\n26\n00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.197\nSo the first thing I'd like to talk about,\n\n27\n00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:02.883\nwell really the only thing that we're\ngonna be focusing on this show here,\n\n28\n00:01:02.883 --> 00:01:06.280\nis going to be something called\nguest integration services.\n\n29\n00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.910\nAnd you may also be seeing it\nnoted as just integration services\n\n30\n00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.040\nin different verbage.\n\n31\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.060\nWe even saw that in other technology and\nterms here, Microsoft does that sometimes.\n\n32\n00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.310\nBut that's okay,\neither way it's kind of a cool concept.\n\n33\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.170\nIt's going to be a software package that\nwill actually enhance the functionality\n\n34\n00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.660\nof the communication and the drivers and\n\n35\n00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.430\neverything within our guest operating\nsystems and the host operating system.\n\n36\n00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.110\nSo what it does is it just\nhelps fuse that integration,\n\n37\n00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.790\nor enhance it between the guest and\nthe host operating systems.\n\n38\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.750\nWes, I know you've been\nworking with computers for\n\n39\n00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.700\na long time, and\nI don't wanna show our age here.\n\n40\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.290\nBut back in the day,\nwhen you were to go ahead and,\n\n41\n00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.785\nlet's say, blow out a computer and\nperform a clean install, and\n\n42\n00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:05.460\nyou'd have to go and get all the drivers,\nand it was a manual process.\n\n43\n00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.110\nAnd usually you'd try to the get\nlike the ethernet driver first so\n\n44\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.160\nthat you could get that machine\nconnected to the internet so\n\n45\n00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.865\nyou could download the other drivers and\ninstall them.\n\n46\n00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:17.570\nAnd Windows has really made it easier for\nus nowadays, and\n\n47\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.620\nit'll provide a lot of those drivers for\nus.\n\n48\n00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.300\nBut with virtualization, you've seen\nwhen we've created those machines,\n\n49\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.090\nMicrosoft is able to note the operating\nsystem that you're creating when you\n\n50\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.402\ngenerate that virtual machine.\n\n51\n00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:38.920\nAnd they're kinda providing a real\ngeneric package of drivers for you.\n\n52\n00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.090\nSo sometimes you won't have the best\nfunctionality in your virtual machine.\n\n53\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.260\nI mean, Hyper-V does support a lot\nof different virtual machines, or\n\n54\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.216\noperating systems I should say.\n\n55\n00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:54.219\nEven Linux operating systems.\n\n56\n00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:59.720\nLet's say this, they don't claim all\noperating systems, but it's possible.\n\n57\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.650\nI mean, if your operating system that you\nwanna use as a guest, here within Hyper-V,\n\n58\n00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.560\nisn't on their list, then you can just\nGoogle the list and they have that.\n\n59\n00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.660\nOr being the list,\nwe are on a Microsoft show.\n\n60\n00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.660\nBut yeah,\nthat doesn't mean that you can't use it.\n\n61\n00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.900\nIt just means that they haven't tested it,\nthey don't support it in any way.\n\n62\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.760\nSo just throwing that out there.\n\n63\n00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.810\nBut it's pretty cool.\n\n64\n00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.180\nIf we take a look at it from the server\nside, because if you think about it, guest\n\n65\n00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.160\nintegration services has to be both on\nthe host and the guest operating systems.\n\n66\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.090\nSo server side 2012 and later,\nit's something that's already built in.\n\n67\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.360\nAnd then client side Windows 8 and\nlater, it's already built in.\n\n68\n00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.390\nSo older machines, Windows 7 machines,\nsome machines may have it, but you just\n\n69\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.450\nneed to upgrade or update the integration\nservices package, which you can do.\n\n70\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.950\nThey provide a lot of really\ngood documentation for that, and\n\n71\n00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.710\nthen some operating systems\nmay not have it at all and\n\n72\n00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.400\nyou will need to go ahead and reach\nout to the Internet, to the interwebs.\n\n73\n00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.600\nBut again,\nif you take a look at my screen,\n\n74\n00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.500\nthey do a great job of providing\na ton of information for us here.\n\n75\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.440\nJust showing you how to integrate\nit with the server side and\n\n76\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.220\nusing it with Hyper-V here.\n\n77\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.020\nAlso on the guest, remember so the client\nside here, a lot of good hyperlinks that\n\n78\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.590\nyou can use, and syntax as well\nusing it here with PowerShell.\n\n79\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.700\nAnd I'll show you how to go ahead and\nget that set up with PowerShell and\n\n80\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.805\nin the GUI.\n\n81\n00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:36.190\nWwe can also take a look at\nthis when we jump in the demo.\n\n82\n00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.430\nIt is services that we're seeing here,\nso we can note them\n\n83\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.440\nthrough our services interface as well,\nour management console there.\n\n84\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.890\nAnd they also provide some,\nwith the Linux guest here,\n\n85\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.860\nsome bash scripting so\nthat you can know how to go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.700\nget that installed on those Linux\nmachines that they support as well.\n\n87\n00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.130\nBut let me scroll on up.\n\n88\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.135\nI want to spend some time talking\nabout the individual ervices\n\n89\n00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:08.190\nthat guest integration services offer.\n\n90\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.399\nSo if we click here for\nHyper-V Integration Services,\n\n91\n00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:14.607\nthis will pull up a list of\ndifferent services that we can\n\n92\n00:05:14.607 --> 00:05:19.130\nactually leverage whenever we go ahead and\nenable our integration services.\n\n93\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.390\nLet's just go through the list.\n\n94\n00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.280\nThe first one we have here\nHyper-V Heartbeat Service.\n\n95\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.645\nThis one's pretty cool.\n\n96\n00:05:26.645 --> 00:05:31.520\nAnd Wes and I were talking before the\nshow, just an analogy I like to use for\n\n97\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.630\nthis particular service, I have kids,\n\n98\n00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.090\nWes has kids, we know,\nhey yell out the front door and\n\n99\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.920\nmake sure your kids are still alive if\nthey're playing in the yard or something.\n\n100\n00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.300\nAnd when you call that door to\ncheck on your children, you expect\n\n101\n00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.170\na response from them, and that's kind\nof what our Heartbeat Service does.\n\n102\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.400\nIt has the parent, or the host\noperating system here, calling out,\n\n103\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.860\nchecking on those guest operating\nsystems expecting a response for them.\n\n104\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.020\nSo if that system does not receive\na response, then that'll go ahead and\n\n105\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.370\nraise an alert, generate an alert for\nyou so you can investigate it and\n\n106\n00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.070\nmake sure that the machine\nhasn't locked up, or crashed, or\n\n107\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.402\nsomething to that nature, whatever,\njust to go ahead and investigate.\n\n108\n00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:18.150\nIt's pretty cool how they've\norganized all this documentation so\n\n109\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.730\nyou can just click that hyperlink here and\nsee even the PowerShell commandlets and\n\n110\n00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.110\nthe different commands that we can use to\nleverage all these individual services.\n\n111\n00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.700\nPretty cool.\n\n112\n00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.390\nAnd actually you can see\nsome of the other ones.\n\n113\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.009\nWe'll just hit that back arrow here and\ntake a look at those.\n\n114\n00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:38.390\nAll right, now this one is a pretty\nnifty feature, nifty, man.\n\n115\n00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.120\nAlright, Hyper-V guest shutdown service.\n\n116\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.860\nIt really is though,\nif you think about it,\n\n117\n00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.890\nwhat it does is it allows the host to\ntrigger virtual machines to shutdown.\n\n118\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.230\nWhy is that handy?\n\n119\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.570\nWell, instead of having an admin\nactually log into that machine or\n\n120\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.790\nbring it up to log it down, you can just\n\n121\n00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.750\npower it down from within Hyper-V or\neven PowerShell as well.\n\n122\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.740\nSo that could help save time.\n\n123\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.970\nThis is a good one too, Wes.\n\n124\n00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.010\nThis is going to be\nHyper-V Time Synchronization Service.\n\n125\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.070\nSo when you're thinking\nabout networking and\n\n126\n00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.510\nthe different systems in your environment,\nhow important is time?\n\n127\n00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.305\n&gt;&gt; Well, they say time is money.\n\n128\n00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:22.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Joking around though,\n\n129\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.330\nI mean just everything relies on timing.\n\n130\n00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.100\nOur communications rely on timing.\n\n131\n00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.270\nNot everything's asynchronous,\na lot of things are synchronous.\n\n132\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.265\nI think of for instance computers\nthat are domain joined, right?\n\n133\n00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:35.370\nThey've gotta be able to have\na synchronized clock that's, I think,\n\n134\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.120\nthe thresholds,\n\n135\n00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.770\nlike we're within five minutes of whatever\nthe master time clock of the domain is.\n\n136\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.180\nIf they don't have that, then well,\nthey lose their trust with the domain.\n\n137\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.788\nAnd in other episodes, we talked about the\nCIA triads, confidentiality, integrity and\n\n138\n00:07:47.788 --> 00:07:48.641\navailability.\n\n139\n00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:51.429\nSo you can see that if you don't\nhave synchronization with the domain\n\n140\n00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.265\ncontroller, you get kicked off the domain.\n\n141\n00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:54.280\nWell guess what?\n\n142\n00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.180\nYou don't have any availability\nto resources cuz you're not\n\n143\n00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.293\na part of the domain, so\n\n144\n00:07:58.293 --> 00:08:01.599\nI can see where that can just bring\nproductivity completely offline.\n\n145\n00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:05.570\n&gt;&gt; Right, just making sure everyone is on\nthe same page or schedule, same clock,\n\n146\n00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.180\nsame time.\n\n147\n00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.870\nSo synchronization,\ndefinitely important there.\n\n148\n00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.500\nSome other things that we have here\nwould be data exchange service.\n\n149\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.880\nAnd it provides a way to\nexchange basic metadata\n\n150\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.450\nbetween the virtual machine and the host.\n\n151\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.450\nSo what that means is your fully qualified\ndomain and additional information that\n\n152\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:27.900\nwould just help be able to manage and\nmaintain those virtual machines there.\n\n153\n00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.824\nSo definitely want to have that\nline of communication open.\n\n154\n00:08:30.824 --> 00:08:33.451\nSo this one's pretty cool.\n\n155\n00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:36.940\nHyperV volume shadow copy requester.\n\n156\n00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.980\nAnd this is going to be, Wes,\nwe were talking about this also.\n\n157\n00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.211\nThis is a pretty important one because we\nsee VSS being integrated with a lot of\n\n158\n00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:47.414\nfunctionality within\nthe Microsoft Operating Systems.\n\n159\n00:08:47.414 --> 00:08:49.517\nSo we can leverage what kind of things?\n\n160\n00:08:49.517 --> 00:08:50.607\nBack-ups.\n\n161\n00:08:50.607 --> 00:08:52.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, I look at System Restore, right?\n\n162\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.468\nSystem Restore is one of the things that\nwe use cuz we gotta create that point in\n\n163\n00:08:56.468 --> 00:09:00.289\ntime snapshot of the configuration,\nthe system state data of your machine so\n\n164\n00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:04.142\nthat you can restored to an earlier point\nin time if you get a problematic app.\n\n165\n00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:07.015\nWe use it for things like previous\nversions when I want to keep multiple\n\n166\n00:09:07.015 --> 00:09:07.853\nversions of files.\n\n167\n00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:10.220\nI need to be able to restore one\nto an earlier point in time.\n\n168\n00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.870\nWell, how is it that you\nactually use your hard\n\n169\n00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.010\ndrive at the same time there's a service\ntrying to make a copy of the hard drive?\n\n170\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.160\nWell, that's the great thing about VSS or\nvolume shadow copy service.\n\n171\n00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.010\nI know it's got a couple different\nacronyms there that we've seen.\n\n172\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.680\nNow you can see that they're\nintegrating it right into the VM.\n\n173\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.430\nSo the same thing where the VM\ncan continue to run, but\n\n174\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.120\nat the same time you could put it\ninto almost like a snap shot, right?\n\n175\n00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.435\nLike a point in time, checkpoint, if you\nwill, at the same time, still being able\n\n176\n00:09:38.435 --> 00:09:42.213\nto utilize the virtual machine without\nactually having to shut it down.\n\n177\n00:09:42.213 --> 00:09:45.192\nTake a snapshot of it and\nthing bring it back online.\n\n178\n00:09:45.192 --> 00:09:49.718\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it definitely provides some cool\nfunctionality there, being able to use and\n\n179\n00:09:49.718 --> 00:09:53.750\nintegrate well within those virtual\nmachines in that environment.\n\n180\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.920\nAnd another thing that's pretty cool,\nif we take a look here,\n\n181\n00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.080\nthis is going to be the HyperV\nguest service interface.\n\n182\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.300\nAnd we have the ability to\ncreate map to network drives,\n\n183\n00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.780\nto share files and\ninformation throughout our network.\n\n184\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.000\nBut what if I didn't wanna do that, and\n\n185\n00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.780\nI just wanted an easy way to directly\nshare files with my virtual machines?\n\n186\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.105\nWell, that's what our HyperV guest\nservice interface does for us there,\n\n187\n00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:16.172\namongst other things.\n\n188\n00:10:16.172 --> 00:10:18.470\nSo just know that that's available.\n\n189\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.190\nAnd then, lastly, we have our\nHype-V PowerShell Direct Service.\n\n190\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.140\nAnd this one is kinda cool, too.\n\n191\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.760\nSo from a management perspective,\n\n192\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.180\nyou can actually use PowerShell\ncommandlets to go ahead and\n\n193\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:34.105\nexecute remotely without via PowerShell,\nwithout having a network connection there.\n\n194\n00:10:34.105 --> 00:10:39.275\nSo you can see how these\nservices do provide a plethora of\n\n195\n00:10:39.275 --> 00:10:43.985\ndifferent functionalities that I may\nwanna leverage here as an admin.\n\n196\n00:10:43.985 --> 00:10:49.365\nBut we have to go ahead and\nmake sure that we, again, have that setup.\n\n197\n00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:52.815\nAnd again, from the server side,\nserver 2012 and moving forward.\n\n198\n00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:57.240\nSo in the machine that we're working on,\non the server side, it's all ready there.\n\n199\n00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.560\nAnd the client that we have,\nlet me go ahead and pull that up.\n\n200\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.237\nIf we go ahead and pull up a HyperV or\n\n201\n00:11:02.237 --> 00:11:06.790\na Windows 8 box, it's already there,\nbut we just need to enable it.\n\n202\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.870\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nlaunch HyperV manager here.\n\n203\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.270\nAnd what machine are we gonna play with?\n\n204\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:17.218\nHow about the PLAB Win 802, first of all?\n\n205\n00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:21.047\nNow, if I go ahead and\njust right-click select Connect,\n\n206\n00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.400\nthe machine isn't powered on yet.\n\n207\n00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.188\nBut I want to show you, if you select\nthe Action menu in the top-left\n\n208\n00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.960\ncorner here from the drop-down menu.\n\n209\n00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.314\nI'll zoom in so you can see this.\n\n210\n00:11:33.314 --> 00:11:37.140\nThe option that we want to,\nlet's do that again.\n\n211\n00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.290\nThe option that we want to select,\n\n212\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.920\nInsert integration services setup disk,\nis grayed out.\n\n213\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.880\nSo we do need to go ahead and power\nthat machine on, because it'll initiate\n\n214\n00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.400\nan action that requires attention for\nus from within the machine.\n\n215\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.500\nSo let me just go ahead and\npower this machine on.\n\n216\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.530\nAnd we'll log on here.\n\n217\n00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.090\nGive it a second.\n\n218\n00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.140\nIt's actually really simple to do so.\n\n219\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.460\nAnd if you're working on an older machine,\nyou may have to go out and\n\n220\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.091\ngrab that package, or just update it,\nif you have it in an older version.\n\n221\n00:12:13.062 --> 00:12:15.152\nWe'll still be able to see\nit once it gets going.\n\n222\n00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:21.420\nAnd let me explain something real quick.\n\n223\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.200\nI'm actually using practice labs, and\nyou guys have access to them, too.\n\n224\n00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.130\nBut because of the way, so we're\ndealing with HyperV and virtualization,\n\n225\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:36.580\nthe platform that practice labs use,\nthey're actually using vSphere.\n\n226\n00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.080\nAnd there's a glitch or\n\n227\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.840\na bug with the way vSphere interacts\nwith an Intel processor there.\n\n228\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.720\nSo I'm gonna show you how to use this,\nbut we're not able to actually go through\n\n229\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.610\neverything because, and show you how\nit works as far as remote shutdowns and\n\n230\n00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.200\nthings like that,\nbecause it's just an issue.\n\n231\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.720\nThere is a fix on how to do that if\nthat is something you're working with\n\n232\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.990\nin your environment.\n\n233\n00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.432\nI can't remember\nthe correct password here.\n\n234\n00:13:03.144 --> 00:13:06.900\nBut for now,\nI just wanna show you how to do it.\n\n235\n00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.550\nIt's pretty simple,\nyou'll be all right with it.\n\n236\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.900\nNow, if we go back to this Action\nmenu over here on the left, and\n\n237\n00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.583\nfrom this drop-down, we can now see\nthis option is available to us.\n\n238\n00:13:16.583 --> 00:13:18.640\nSo that's what we'll select.\n\n239\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.377\nAnd then, we'll just kinda\nstay vigilant here because\n\n240\n00:13:24.377 --> 00:13:30.732\nwe will see a fly out menu up\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n241\n00:13:30.732 --> 00:13:33.409\nDo that again.\n\n242\n00:13:33.409 --> 00:13:34.566\nThere we go.\n\n243\n00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:36.090\nAnd then, go ahead and, it happened twice.\n\n244\n00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.310\nYou just have to be patient,\nCherokee, that's all.\n\n245\n00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.300\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n246\n00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.650\nclick on that and this is the action\nthat we need to go ahead and select.\n\n247\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.690\nSo you can see here from the fly out menu.\n\n248\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.850\nIt says install\nHyperV Integration Services.\n\n249\n00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:55.090\nAnd it's a pretty simple step that we\njust have to go ahead and do here.\n\n250\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.090\nNow, this is just a notification.\n\n251\n00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.260\nIt says Unsupported Guest Environment.\n\n252\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.320\nThe HyperV integration services can only\nbe installed inside of a virtual machine\n\n253\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.550\nrunning under HyperV.\n\n254\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.090\nAnd because I told you guys about that,\nthat's why you're seeing this.\n\n255\n00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.210\nBut don't worry.\n\n256\n00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.282\nIf you're just running HyperV in\na non-nested environment, and by saying\n\n257\n00:14:15.282 --> 00:14:20.684\nnested, all we mean is we're running\nmultiple layers of virtualization here.\n\n258\n00:14:20.684 --> 00:14:23.400\nSo that's why you're\nseeing that notification.\n\n259\n00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.770\nReally, that's it from the graphical user\ninterface side on the client side here.\n\n260\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.850\nSo now, we can leverage and take advantage\n\n261\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.590\nof the services with our guest\nintegration services on this machine.\n\n262\n00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:40.570\nBut I'd also like to show you how to use\nthat from a PowerShell perspective here.\n\n263\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:46.120\nSo now, I am back inside of, the name\nof my machine here is just HyperV.\n\n264\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.278\nAnd you can see from my\ndemo environment here.\n\n265\n00:14:48.278 --> 00:14:52.160\nSo my HyperV machine is the machine\nthat's running HyperV, and\n\n266\n00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.870\nis the host operating system for\nall of these guests listed here.\n\n267\n00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.950\nSo, all I really have to\ndo is pull up PowerShell.\n\n268\n00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.560\nIt's down here at the bottom,\nif you guys can see that.\n\n269\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:09.490\nBut it's a great tool because I can\nactually, that was from the last show\n\n270\n00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:14.230\nthere, but I can actually manage multiple\nmachines without going into each one,\n\n271\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.300\nwaiting to power them on,\nand work on them.\n\n272\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.140\nSo the first thing I wanna do here is,\n\n273\n00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.097\nlet's see, get-vm, And\n\n274\n00:15:27.097 --> 00:15:32.010\nthe name of the machine we wanna take\na look at here is going to be PLAB.\n\n275\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.933\nAnd this is Win 803.\n\n276\n00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:39.006\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna grab that machine, and\n\n277\n00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:42.780\nthen I'm gonna take the output, and\nI wanna pipe it into a format list.\n\n278\n00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:49.170\nAnd then, I'm gonna use a wild card here,\nan asterisk, to go ahead and take\n\n279\n00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.840\na look at the different services that are\ncurrently running on that machine here.\n\n280\n00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.426\nAnd the one that I'm looking for here is,\n\n281\n00:15:56.426 --> 00:16:00.766\nI wanna check the state of my integration\nservices, so just give me a second.\n\n282\n00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:04.731\nBecause my resolution is\nkind of funky in here.\n\n283\n00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:07.377\nLet's see, moving down.\n\n284\n00:16:16.438 --> 00:16:19.999\nThis is why a lot of times I\npipe it to the Out-Gridview, or\n\n285\n00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:24.300\nyou can even save it as a text\nfile cuz it's easier to find.\n\n286\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.190\nIntegration services,\nVMIntegrationService,\n\n287\n00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.260\nTime Synchronization, so\nyou can see the different components here.\n\n288\n00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.650\nIt is currently not, it's installed,\nbut it's not running and enabled.\n\n289\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:45.010\nAnd I'm trying to go slow here, but\nyou can see different components.\n\n290\n00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.821\nI'm looking for a heart beat, it's kind of\nhard to see scrolling by this fast, but\n\n291\n00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:51.560\nyou can see all of that.\n\n292\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.872\nIt's blank right here for my integration\nservices, it would say upgrade or\n\n293\n00:16:56.872 --> 00:17:01.444\nupdate here if you had an older\nversion that needed to be updated.\n\n294\n00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.934\nI'm trying to find.\n\n295\n00:17:09.483 --> 00:17:13.018\nWe're also gonna be talking about, while\nI'm here, just show you a few things,\n\n296\n00:17:13.018 --> 00:17:16.620\nwe're gonna be talking about resource\nmetering, currently enabled to be false.\n\n297\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.330\nCouple of these different services, we're\ngonna be covering in the next show, so\n\n298\n00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.380\nit's not a bad idea just to get\nfamiliar with this particular command.\n\n299\n00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.726\nAnd it's hard to see it on my screen,\nbut it's not enabled.\n\n300\n00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:32.467\nSo we need to go ahead, and let me just\nclear that so we have a better view, and\n\n301\n00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:34.130\nwe'll get that enabled.\n\n302\n00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.030\nSo the cmdlet that we wanna\nuse is going to be enable.\n\n303\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:44.884\nAnd this is going to be VM integration,\nAnd actually let me tab through that.\n\n304\n00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:47.770\nSo this is going to be\nour VMIntegrationService.\n\n305\n00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:53.140\nAnd here, we'll go ahead and\nspecify the VM name, this one, again,\n\n306\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.253\nfor our machine here, PLAB,\nthis is our Windows 803 machine.\n\n307\n00:17:58.253 --> 00:18:00.175\nAnd the name of the service,\n\n308\n00:18:00.175 --> 00:18:04.995\nwe will say name then add our quotations\nbecause there are spaces here.\n\n309\n00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:12.387\nSo this is going to be\nGuest Service Interface.\n\n310\n00:18:12.387 --> 00:18:16.307\nEnd quotes, and get that.\n\n311\n00:18:16.307 --> 00:18:18.222\nNow, not a whole lot, right?\n\n312\n00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:21.349\nWe're like, okay, well-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love how PowerShell does that.\n\n313\n00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:22.769\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you do something wrong,\n\n314\n00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.670\nI mean it just paints red\nacross the entire screen.\n\n315\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.028\n&gt;&gt; It'll let you know.\n&gt;&gt; It rubs it in your face, but\n\n316\n00:18:26.028 --> 00:18:28.132\nwhen you do something right,\nit just, okay, just moving on.\n\n317\n00:18:28.132 --> 00:18:30.316\n&gt;&gt; No accolades whatsoever, yeah.\n\n318\n00:18:30.316 --> 00:18:30.892\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nothing to see here.\n\n319\n00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:32.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So a couple things you\n\n320\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.330\ncould do to check that.\n\n321\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:38.250\nIf I was actually enabling this and\nusing PowerShell on the machine that I\n\n322\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.910\nwas working with,\nI could pull up my services console.\n\n323\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.500\nLet me just pull it up anyways to\nshow you what that would look like.\n\n324\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.252\nSo, Let's see,\n\n325\n00:18:50.252 --> 00:18:54.685\nlet's just go services.msc.\n\n326\n00:18:54.685 --> 00:18:58.806\nNow, I'm not gonna see it enabled\non this machine because this\n\n327\n00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:00.846\nis the host operating system.\n\n328\n00:19:00.846 --> 00:19:02.809\nBut I did wanna just let you know and\n\n329\n00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:07.290\nyou'll see the different Hyper-V\nservices that are associated with these.\n\n330\n00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.231\nAnd it should be in alphabetical order\nhere, and I guess I just missed it, okay.\n\n331\n00:19:16.674 --> 00:19:21.870\nI'm like losing at\nthe searching [LAUGH] today.\n\n332\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.970\nAll right, here they are, and\nyou can see them all right here.\n\n333\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.020\nActually, let me pull that out so\nyou can it a little bit better.\n\n334\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.320\nThe different types of services there.\n\n335\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.170\nAnd then, of course,\nyou would note in the status column over\n\n336\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.453\nhere if that service was in fact running.\n\n337\n00:19:38.453 --> 00:19:42.580\nSo you see the Heartbeat service, the\nGuest Shutdown service and so forth there.\n\n338\n00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.900\nBut a more accurate way to go ahead and\n\n339\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.620\ncheck that is right\nhere within PowerShell.\n\n340\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.878\nSo let's go ahead and\nverify that with our get command.\n\n341\n00:19:51.878 --> 00:19:57.728\nSo we're gonna do get dash, and this\nis going to be VM integration service.\n\n342\n00:20:03.927 --> 00:20:05.810\nI'm trying to tap through, but okay.\n\n343\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.470\nI see why, I spelled VM wrong.\n\n344\n00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.290\nI wonder what NM is, Wes.\n\n345\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.480\n&gt;&gt; That's a new module.\n\n346\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.446\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, all right.\n\n347\n00:20:17.446 --> 00:20:20.528\nAll right, so\nthere's our integration service, and\n\n348\n00:20:20.528 --> 00:20:24.720\nthen the next thing we'll do is,\nagain, just specify the VM name.\n\n349\n00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:30.651\nAnd this is our PLABWIN803.\n\n350\n00:20:30.651 --> 00:20:34.200\nAll right, and let's go ahead and\nhit Enter here.\n\n351\n00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:40.270\nWe can see under this\nenabled column that in fact\n\n352\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.710\nthe services have been enabled\nby that true statement there.\n\n353\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:49.590\nSo we do know that on our\nWindows 8 machine, PLABWIN803,\n\n354\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.380\nwe can check it that way.\n\n355\n00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.590\nWhat else do we want to take a look at?\n\n356\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.430\nHow about just disabling it, right?\n\n357\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.980\nSo that's super easy.\n\n358\n00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.390\nAs a matter of fact,\nI'm just gonna use my up arrow here, and\n\n359\n00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:06.880\nI'm going to go back to the enable cmdlet,\nor command that we used,\n\n360\n00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.120\nand change enable to,\nwhat do you think, Wes?\n\n361\n00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:12.955\n&gt;&gt; I would say disable.\n\n362\n00:21:12.955 --> 00:21:15.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ding, ding, ding.\n\n363\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.227\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n364\n00:21:16.227 --> 00:21:20.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this is going to be,\nif I can spell that, disable,\n\n365\n00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.130\nand then you just run that.\n\n366\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.321\nAnd again, not a whole heck of a lot,\nbut you can go through and\n\n367\n00:21:27.321 --> 00:21:32.253\ncheck again and use that same command\nthat we did before to verify there.\n\n368\n00:21:32.253 --> 00:21:36.146\nAnd you can see that the actual\nguest service interface,\n\n369\n00:21:36.146 --> 00:21:39.730\nthe one that I just disabled there,\nis false.\n\n370\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.442\nAnd you can also do it on a per service,\nor a per machine basis, and\n\n371\n00:21:44.442 --> 00:21:49.669\nsometimes you can even do it on a basis\nfor all the VMs that are installed or\n\n372\n00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:52.830\nrunning on that particular host there.\n\n373\n00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.570\n&gt;&gt; And I like the way you did that too\nbecause of the fact that it seems to me\n\n374\n00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.670\nlike that would be something that'd\nmake it little bit easier for the exam,\n\n375\n00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.820\nthose of you that are going for\nthe 7410, right?\n\n376\n00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.597\nBecause we've got the typical\nPowerShell syntax,\n\n377\n00:22:04.597 --> 00:22:06.660\nright, you've got your verb dash noun.\n\n378\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.110\nSo if you can remember\nthe last part of that, right,\n\n379\n00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.464\nthe one that's always strung out and\nthe longest to remember, right?\n\n380\n00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:15.123\nWell, then you can remember enable and\ndisable,\n\n381\n00:22:15.123 --> 00:22:17.920\nand get shows you what\nthe status of it is currently.\n\n382\n00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.145\nSo looks like it's a good little exam\ntrick right there to memorize that where\n\n383\n00:22:22.145 --> 00:22:26.770\nyou're not thinking, is it enable and\nthen the whole long command, disable?\n\n384\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.950\nJust remember the last\npart of that command, and\n\n385\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.795\nremember the three verbs\nthat you apply to it.\n\n386\n00:22:30.795 --> 00:22:33.340\nIt can make it a little bit easier\nwhen you sit in the hot seat going for\n\n387\n00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.680\nthat certification exam.\n\n388\n00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.345\n&gt;&gt; That is completely true.\n\n389\n00:22:36.345 --> 00:22:40.160\nAnd you can always, I at least\nappreciate any kinda tips that someone\n\n390\n00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.040\nhas to offer me when taking an exam.\n\n391\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.220\nBecause something that I found was\nreally helpful, Wes, there are so\n\n392\n00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.050\nmany of these cmdlets, and\nyou guys have seen and I showed you.\n\n393\n00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:52.090\nBut if you export those to a text file and\njust print it, and almost use it\n\n394\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.000\nas a checklist to go through and make\nsure, hey, at least I've seen this before.\n\n395\n00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.617\nI know what it does because, sitting\nthere in that booth looking at a list,\n\n396\n00:23:00.617 --> 00:23:05.233\nand sometimes they don't just do A B C D,\nsometimes you get up to J and H, and\n\n397\n00:23:05.233 --> 00:23:08.607\nthe letters start to kinda\nmesh together if you're not\n\n398\n00:23:08.607 --> 00:23:10.773\nreally familiar with them there.\n\n399\n00:23:10.773 --> 00:23:13.012\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what I would do for\nsome of the client exams,\n\n400\n00:23:13.012 --> 00:23:16.658\nI know we're in a server episode here, but\nfor some of the Microsoft client exams,\n\n401\n00:23:16.658 --> 00:23:19.521\nthe things that I would do,\npractice it, is I open a note pad, and\n\n402\n00:23:19.521 --> 00:23:21.424\nI would type them, not in the PowerShell.\n\n403\n00:23:21.424 --> 00:23:23.540\nYou might say, well, Wes,\njust type them in the PowerShell.\n\n404\n00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.610\nWell, then you get all the other\nstuff that goes along with it, and\n\n405\n00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.090\nall I wanna do is memorize the commands.\n\n406\n00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.580\nSo I'd open note pad and\nI would type the cmdlet, do a Ctrl+A, and\n\n407\n00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.740\nthen I'd delete it, and\nthen type it again, and delete it.\n\n408\n00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.050\nAnd it's kinda like that,\nmaybe you remember,\n\n409\n00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.194\nback in grade school when you\nwere learning spelling, right?\n\n410\n00:23:37.194 --> 00:23:38.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Your teacher would send you home\n\n411\n00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.080\nwith a list of words, and you would\nright them down five times each, right?\n\n412\n00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.170\nEven better than that,\none of my favorite blues guitarists said,\n\n413\n00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.480\ndon't practice something\nuntil you get it right.\n\n414\n00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.590\nPractice it until you can't get it wrong,\nthen you know it's always right.\n\n415\n00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.730\nSo definitely.\n\n416\n00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.334\nSo all right,\nwhat else do we got on our list here?\n\n417\n00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:57.827\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, I did kind of, it looks like\nwe have a few minutes left here, so\n\n418\n00:23:57.827 --> 00:24:00.789\nI wanted to go back and\njust show you something in my screen so\n\n419\n00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:03.069\nwe can take advantage\nof these moments here.\n\n420\n00:24:03.069 --> 00:24:04.681\nSomething I want to take a look at.\n\n421\n00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:07.880\nLet's just go ahead and\npull up the settings.\n\n422\n00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.230\nWe didn't really go through every\nsingle one of these settings here, and\n\n423\n00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.690\nsince we have a few minutes,\nI mentioned to you I would like\n\n424\n00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.350\nyou to go through all of these\nsettings and just play around.\n\n425\n00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:22.300\nBut just looking at the settings here,\nthis is kind of a pop quiz and a test for\n\n426\n00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.610\nyourself to see if you remember\nsome of the previous information.\n\n427\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.070\nCan you tell just by\nlooking at the settings for\n\n428\n00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:33.490\nthis particular machine what\ngeneration is it, gen one or gen two?\n\n429\n00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.860\nAnd so if you think about the underlying,\n\n430\n00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.340\nthe low level architecture of\nthe operating system here,\n\n431\n00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.550\nwe can see that there's actually\nBIOSover here on the left hand side.\n\n432\n00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.710\nSo just kind of keep that in mind as well,\nbecause remember, with our gen two,\n\n433\n00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.870\nlike we've spoken about, that's gonna be\nUEFI based, and you can note that there\n\n434\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:56.040\nare slight discrepancies or different\nways you can boot those machines.\n\n435\n00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.710\n&gt;&gt; And one of the things I remember that\nyou taught us in a previous episode is,\n\n436\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:04.627\nhey, they might ask you, maybe even\ngive you some kind of like a exhibit,\n\n437\n00:25:04.627 --> 00:25:06.830\nwhere you've got a screenshot and\nthey'd say, okay,\n\n438\n00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.810\ndoes this virtual machine\nsupport secure boot?\n\n439\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.470\nAnd you could look and say,\nwell it's a BIOS machine, so no,\n\n440\n00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.990\nit's not gonna support secure boot\nbecause that's a UEFI base setting,\n\n441\n00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.440\nand if your virtual machine\ndoesn't support UEFI,\n\n442\n00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.640\nit's not gonna support bi-associations,\nnot gonna support secure boot.\n\n443\n00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.860\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's all about those\nlittle details like that, Wes,\n\n444\n00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.140\nand even just looking at something,\nwhat was I gonna show you?\n\n445\n00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.010\nHere with our DVD drive.\n\n446\n00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.090\nThis is kind of cool too,\nhere with our IDE.\n\n447\n00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.756\nJust remember I have the ability,\nlet me see,\n\n448\n00:25:37.756 --> 00:25:42.594\nif I go ahead and click on that one,\nthere we go, to specify.\n\n449\n00:25:42.594 --> 00:25:48.760\nI can have my digital ISO image that\nI'm pointing and mounting to here.\n\n450\n00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:54.060\nBut I can also take advantage here of\na physical CD or DVD drive bay as well.\n\n451\n00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.610\nSo really that's it.\n\n452\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.850\nI just wanted to remind you to\nplay around with the settings.\n\n453\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:04.695\nSo in addition to PowerShell and Hyper-V\nManager, just a lot of things to look at,\n\n454\n00:26:04.695 --> 00:26:06.645\nbut they're all great\nthings to be familiar with.\n\n455\n00:26:06.645 --> 00:26:09.204\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of interesting information\nin there in a way that you can get\n\n456\n00:26:09.204 --> 00:26:10.967\na better experience out\nof the virtual machine.\n\n457\n00:26:10.967 --> 00:26:13.397\nAnd kind of enhance\nthe communication between those and\n\n458\n00:26:13.397 --> 00:26:17.067\ntake advantage of those features, so those\nof you that are watching and prepping for\n\n459\n00:26:17.067 --> 00:26:20.030\nthis exam, make sure that you do\ntake Cherokee's advice, right?\n\n460\n00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.847\nGet in there work with the operating\nsystem, work with Hyper-V.\n\n461\n00:26:23.847 --> 00:26:27.333\nKnow what the different PowerShell\ncommandlets are, right?\n\n462\n00:26:27.333 --> 00:26:29.353\nMaybe you don't have to know\nevery single parameter, right?\n\n463\n00:26:29.353 --> 00:26:32.303\nBecause if they were going to test of on\nevery single parameter in PowerShell,\n\n464\n00:26:32.303 --> 00:26:33.885\nevery one of us would fail, right?\n\n465\n00:26:33.885 --> 00:26:34.403\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n466\n00:26:34.403 --> 00:26:35.873\n&gt;&gt; Just know some of the basics, right?\n\n467\n00:26:35.873 --> 00:26:38.253\nSo some of the basics that we've\nshown you in this episode.\n\n468\n00:26:38.253 --> 00:26:40.540\nNow, that was a lot of\nreally great information.\n\n469\n00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.266\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, anything else that you\nmight to tell our viewers before we\n\n470\n00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:43.980\nwrap this one up?\n\n471\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, I would definitely ask for\nthem to come back for the next episode.\n\n472\n00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.700\nBecause this was just one of the many\nservices that we need to look out\n\n473\n00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.050\nhow to configure.\n\n474\n00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.360\nSo we'll go through the different\nobjectives that Microsoft calls out for\n\n475\n00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.230\nthat exam.\n\n476\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:00.300\nBut also from a working perspective, it's\ngreat to know those in the next episode.\n\n477\n00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.780\n&gt;&gt; We look forward to\nseeing you in that episode.\n\n478\n00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.642\nAnd we thank you, the viewer, watching.\n\n479\n00:27:03.642 --> 00:27:05.800\nWe're gonna go ahead sign out here for\nIT Pro TV.\n\n480\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.630\nI've been your

00:00:11.664\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:14.600\n&gt;&gt; Hello and welcome to another\ngreat episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.650\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we're continuing through our\n\n6\n00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.890\nseries in the 7410, that's right,\nthe MCSA in Windows Server 2012.\n\n7\n00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.620\nAnd joining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.620\nCherokee, how are you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.570\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, thank you for\nhaving me today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.490\n&gt;&gt; All right, it's been great being here,\nwe've been talking about Hyper V,\n\n11\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.760\nvirtual machines, right,\n\n12\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.250\nwe've been talking about how to manage\nthem through the graphical user interface.\n\n13\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.500\nWe even have some episodes on how\nto work with them in Powershell.\n\n14\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.790\nSo what are we going to be\nlooking at in this episode?\n\n15\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.430\nAre we going to continue along\nthe path that leads to, well,\n\n16\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.935\nvirtual machine configuration?\n\n17\n00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:52.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We most definitely are,\nWes and yeah, hopefully that path\n\n18\n00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.440\nwill lead you to a certification or maybe\neven a raise in your job, but who knows.\n\n19\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.351\nFor this show,\nI think a good place for us to start\n\n20\n00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:04.122\nwill be with a feature enhancement of\nHyper V, something called Smart Paging.\n\n21\n00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:08.659\nAnd [LAUGH] it's kind of funny,\nbecause I've done something,\n\n22\n00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.182\nthe opposite of smart,\nI guess, [LAUGH] before.\n\n23\n00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:15.559\nAnd hopefully,\nyou guys don't ever make that mistake.\n\n24\n00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:18.151\nIf you're managing machines remotely and\n\n25\n00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:22.615\nyou ever powered them down, or\nthey shut down, you always wanna make sure\n\n26\n00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:27.910\nthat someone at that remote location has\naccess to power that machine back on.\n\n27\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.150\nWell, with virtualization we've\nalready talked about different\n\n28\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.480\ntypes of memory contention that may occur.\n\n29\n00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.000\nSo, what if, and we also talked about\nutilizing this memory, sometimes\n\n30\n00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.620\nwe need that extra burst of memory\nto go ahead and reboot that machine.\n\n31\n00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.040\nSo during the situation of a reboot,\nwhat if for\n\n32\n00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.950\nsome reason there's not enough memory\navailable to that virtual machine that\n\n33\n00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.390\ngot powered down or performed a reboot and\nit's not powering back on, what do you do?\n\n34\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.260\nAnd with physical machines,\nyeah, you'd have to drive or\n\n35\n00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.200\nget someone to go there and\nyou'd say, hey, guess what?\n\n36\n00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.200\nI shut this machine down,\nI need you to go turn it on.\n\n37\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.400\nWith virtual machines,\na little different here and\n\n38\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.810\nespecially if you're working remotely.\n\n39\n00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.580\nSmart Paging is a smart way\nthat we can go ahead and\n\n40\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.260\nhopefully prevent that\nissue from happening.\n\n41\n00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.140\nNow, Smart Paging is going to be\nan extension of our dynamic memory.\n\n42\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.030\nWe've already taken a look at\nhow to configure dynamic memory,\n\n43\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.200\nwhich will give us the option to\nset the triage, the wait there,\n\n44\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.560\nas well as, modify our buffer and\nset our minimum and maximum amount of RAM.\n\n45\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.210\nAnd it could even be something, Wes,\n\n46\n00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.770\nas simple as setting that minimum\namount of RAM to something lower\n\n47\n00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.090\nthan what is required to get\nthat machine up and running.\n\n48\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.780\nWhich could be an issue if\nwe were to configure that\n\n49\n00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.420\nwhile the machine was running.\n\n50\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.760\nAnd then it did a reboot and it never came\nback alive, like, what would happen then?\n\n51\n00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.790\nWell, if you guys are all familiar\nwith page files, right, so,\n\n52\n00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.020\nwe can actually in our operating\nsystems take advantage of a portion\n\n53\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.790\nof the hard drive and kind of fool the\noperating system into thinking that hey,\n\n54\n00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.240\nthis is actually memory.\n\n55\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.740\nWell, we can do that here with Hyper V\nin our virtual machines, as well.\n\n56\n00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.800\nSo, what we can do, is we can take a piece\nof a hard drive, a physical disk and\n\n57\n00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.530\nwe can use it as part of our smart\npaging here to kind of act as like,\n\n58\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.130\na crutch, or a last ditch effort\nto make sure that those machines\n\n59\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.070\nwill boot in an event of a failure or\nsomething catastrophic that happened or\n\n60\n00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.780\njust something that was even unplanned\nlike a misconfiguration there.\n\n61\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.740\nNow, I will say you need to kind of\nthink about where it is you're pointing\n\n62\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.700\nthat page, the Smart Page,\nyou can configure the location there,\n\n63\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.980\nbecause you really don't want to have that\non a drive that's hosting your system.\n\n64\n00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.300\nSo if you have an additional drive, then\nthat would be ideal, because you wouldn't\n\n65\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.628\nhave any of that hardware contention\nthere, the drive reads and writes.\n\n66\n00:03:57.628 --> 00:03:58.260\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n67\n00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.590\nthat sounds kind of like just no different\nthan what the virtual memory manager would\n\n68\n00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.140\ndo on your client operating systems\non a normal physical machine.\n\n69\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.240\nYou have to be very careful cuz you\nalready have the operating system\n\n70\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.120\nperforming reads and writes and\nthen if it's also performing reads and\n\n71\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.180\nwrites to the swap file or the page file,\nif you will, I think it's pagefile.sys or\n\n72\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.250\nsomething like that,\nthen you're gonna start to see slower and\n\n73\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.580\nslower and slower performance.\n\n74\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.380\nAnd that's why they say to allocate\nthat page file just separate it off\n\n75\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.310\nto second drive to optimize\nthe performance of the overall system, so\n\n76\n00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.960\nit looks like we're seeing\nthe same thing here,\n\n77\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.810\nthe difference is it's just Hyper-V that's\nmanaging the paging file in this instance.\n\n78\n00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.780\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, Wes, so,\nsomething that I want to pull up here and\n\n79\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.720\ngive me a second, all right, there it is.\n\n80\n00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.410\nIf we just take a look at when and\n\n81\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.640\nwhen Smart Paging would be used and\nwhen it wouldn't be used.\n\n82\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.550\nBecause really it's going to be reserved\nfor those emergent type situations.\n\n83\n00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.040\nSo Smart Paging is used when you restart\nthe virtual machine and by comparison,\n\n84\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.370\nif we take a look at the alternative here,\nit is when it is not being used,\n\n85\n00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.200\nit's gonna not be used for\nstarting the virtual machine.\n\n86\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.690\nSo we're really only talking\nabout restarts, not for\n\n87\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.780\npowering that machine up.\n\n88\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.640\nAgain, when it is used, when there\nis no physical memory available,\n\n89\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.380\nwhen we're reclaiming memory\nfrom other virtual machines,\n\n90\n00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.880\nwhen that's not available,\nwhen we have exhausted the memory.\n\n91\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.328\nBut when it's not used, like I said,\nnot during a regular startup,\n\n92\n00:05:26.328 --> 00:05:31.120\nnot when oversubscription memory,\nover subscription is required or\n\n93\n00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.800\nif there's a failover of a virtual machine\nwhen you're utilizing Hyper V clusters.\n\n94\n00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.650\nJust knowing the differences, when or\n\n95\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.850\nwhen not that would be applicable,\nmay help you, as well.\n\n96\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.160\nAll right, so what's next?\n\n97\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.110\nWhy don't we go ahead and\nturn Smart Paging on.\n\n98\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.240\nSo if you recall from a previous episode\nwe should already know that dynamic\n\n99\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.790\nmemory cannot be enabled or\ndisabled while the machine is powered on.\n\n100\n00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.990\nSo, if I just go ahead and select one of\nmy machines here, let's go with PLADDM01.\n\n101\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.490\nThis one's powered off, so\nif I right click and then select settings,\n\n102\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.950\nI can actually enable, under memory,\n\n103\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.465\nhere, my dynamic memory and\nthen once I get that set up,\n\n104\n00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:18.785\nokay, and I'll just leave the defaults for\nnow, it really doesn't matter.\n\n105\n00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:20.150\nBut once I get that setup,\n\n106\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.576\nthen I can actually take advantage\nof using our Smart Paging here.\n\n107\n00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:30.750\nAll right, so back into settings here and\non the left hand pane of\n\n108\n00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.740\nthe settings window here,\nI'm gonna scroll this bar down,\n\n109\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.630\nunder management, if I can navigate\nwithout causing a seizure.\n\n110\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.250\nAll right,\nnow you'll see that under the management\n\n111\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.520\nsection Smart Paging is located there,\nokay and it just kind of automatically\n\n112\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.600\ndefaults to that, it just jumped around,\nbut you see what I'm talking about here.\n\n113\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.060\nThe default location here is on the same\nmachine, so, in this lab environment,\n\n114\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.680\nso I'm actually doing what I'm telling\nyou not to do, but that's okay.\n\n115\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.140\nI can change that location if I need to,\nto another drive there,\n\n116\n00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.880\nbut it's really that simple to go ahead\nand enable it, so I can go ahead and\n\n117\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.460\njust make sure that that is turned on,\non a per machine basis there.\n\n118\n00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.600\n&gt;&gt; So still use some of the other settings\nthat you talked about in past episodes,\n\n119\n00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.520\nright, we're gonna want to set\nthings like your minimum and\n\n120\n00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.150\nyour maximum dynamic memory, your startup\nmemory and you're still gonna want to\n\n121\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.025\nset things like the memory buffer and then\nalso things like the memory weight, right?\n\n122\n00:07:33.025 --> 00:07:35.550\nIf it is a high-priority machine and\nwe want to make sure\n\n123\n00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.980\nthat we set the memory weight a little bit\nhigher so that that virtual machine does\n\n124\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.340\ntake priority over the other ones that\nmight be running currently on the host?\n\n125\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.916\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, Wes, we can take\nadvantage of all of these different\n\n126\n00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:49.611\nfeatures and stack them up and really\npick and choose what we want to use and\n\n127\n00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:52.009\ntailor it right to your\nenvironment's needs.\n\n128\n00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:56.812\nSo speaking of that, there is another\nfeature that we can stack on top of that\n\n129\n00:07:56.812 --> 00:07:59.751\nand that is going to be\nour resource metering.\n\n130\n00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:01.085\nAnd this one's kind of interesting.\n\n131\n00:08:01.085 --> 00:08:04.870\nYou know, Wes, you and\nI were talking about this before the show.\n\n132\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:12.592\nWhy would we want to use resource metering\nin addition to its first and obvious use?\n\n133\n00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:15.304\nAnd you're probably thinking,\nwell, what is resource metering?\n\n134\n00:08:15.304 --> 00:08:19.163\nWell, resource metering is\ngoing to be providing a way for\n\n135\n00:08:19.163 --> 00:08:24.620\nus to actually monitor and look at the\ndifferent metrics for our virtual machine.\n\n136\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.370\nSo I can enable it on the host and then\ntake a look at all of my virtual machines.\n\n137\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.370\n&gt;&gt; My first thought was just, and\nyou've mentioned this in other episodes,\n\n138\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.470\nthat virtualization is what allows us to\ndo cloud base solutions today, right?\n\n139\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.364\nSo my first thought was,\nhey maybe you're running a cloud,\n\n140\n00:08:40.364 --> 00:08:42.806\nmaybe you're running\nsomething like Hyper V, and\n\n141\n00:08:42.806 --> 00:08:46.360\nyou wanna do a little bit of charging\nof the resources that are being used.\n\n142\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.910\nCuz that's what a cloud is, right?\n\n143\n00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.730\nIt's pay as a service,\nwhatever the service might be, but\n\n144\n00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.880\nyou had a better example internally\nthat I didn't even think of,\n\n145\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.850\nlike maybe even within your own company\nwhen it comes to resource metering, right?\n\n146\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.540\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah,\nbecause in a lot IT organizations\n\n147\n00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.940\nthe IT department is responsible for\n\n148\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.900\ncharging different organizations for\ncompany resource allocation.\n\n149\n00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.240\nSo that may be something that we\nwant to take a look at there so\n\n150\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.720\nthat we can just appropriately\ncharge those departments.\n\n151\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.640\nBut you had a great suggestion as\nwell as being a cloud provider.\n\n152\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.000\nWe could go ahead and\nmonitor those machines.\n\n153\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.440\nAnd also, I mean,\njust from a management perspective.\n\n154\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.940\nLooking at that machine, I can say,\nhey, I'm really running.\n\n155\n00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.390\nI'm not utilizing memory as much as\nI thought I would on that machine.\n\n156\n00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.820\nSo I can go back into those settings\nlike you mentioned there, and\n\n157\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.910\nlower the thresholds, our upper\ncontrol and lower control limits,\n\n158\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.770\ntherefore the memory.\n\n159\n00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.700\nSo I can, more accurately,\nconfigure my virtual machines.\n\n160\n00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.040\n&gt;&gt; And then coupled with what\nyou told us in another episode,\n\n161\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.200\nwhere it's hot swappable.\n\n162\n00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.600\nI don't have to power the machines off\nanymore to adjust the memory, right?\n\n163\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.240\n&gt;&gt; No-\n&gt;&gt; We can do that on the fly.\n\n164\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.450\n&gt;&gt; Because we've already enabled\ndynamic memory at this point.\n\n165\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.570\nTo use it, to leverage it.\n\n166\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.040\nSo yeah I can just change it on the fly.\n\n167\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.030\n&gt;&gt; So maybe I go in there.\n\n168\n00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.520\nI go into the hyper-v interface.\n\n169\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.250\nI'm using something like\nresource metering and\n\n170\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.200\nI realize hey I've got\na machine's running DNS DHCP.\n\n171\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.920\nI gave it a little bit too much memory.\n\n172\n00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.752\nIt's not really a volatile machine but\nI got the SQL server-\n\n173\n00:10:13.752 --> 00:10:15.117\n&gt;&gt; I could use it somewhere else.\n\n174\n00:10:15.117 --> 00:10:15.806\n&gt;&gt; Running on the database-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n175\n00:10:15.806 --> 00:10:18.151\n&gt;&gt; And\nit's really needing those resources.\n\n176\n00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:19.857\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can move that.\n\n177\n00:10:19.857 --> 00:10:22.209\nAt least we've got a way\nto actually track that and\n\n178\n00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:24.960\nquantify what are we actually\nusing on that host machine.\n\n179\n00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.120\n&gt;&gt; That's a perfect example.\n\n180\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.840\nSo yeah, we can definitely see it being\nused in a lot of different ways here.\n\n181\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.600\nA couple different caveats though,\nit's not enabled by default.\n\n182\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.780\nIt's actually gonna be\nutilizing some re-sum\n\n183\n00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.980\nsystem resources itself to go ahead and\nget this feature up and running.\n\n184\n00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.280\nSo it's something that if you\nmaybe want to take a sampling\n\n185\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.130\nwindow to get those machines up and\nrunning or after they've been running for\n\n186\n00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.690\na while, or you come back on a monthly\nbasis and test them for a day or\n\n187\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.010\nsomething, it really just depends\non how you use this tool, but\n\n188\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.460\nyou can turn it off when you're not using\nit just to save system resources as well.\n\n189\n00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.500\nAnother thing here, Wes, is that we really\ndon't have a graphical user interface,\n\n190\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.150\nso everything that we're gonna be doing\nhere is going to be done from PowerShell.\n\n191\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.260\nSo, not a problem, because we've been\nworking in PowerShell quite a bit, so\n\n192\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.990\nyou guys should already be\ngetting familiar with that and\n\n193\n00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.930\nin addition from the working perspective.\n\n194\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.940\nSo here, studying for your MCSA, we\ndefinitely need to know how to configure\n\n195\n00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.700\nthis particular tool,\nour resource metering.\n\n196\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.660\nBut if you go on and continue for\nyour MCSE for the server infrastructure,\n\n197\n00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.190\nyou're gonna see that again as well.\n\n198\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.940\nSo, it's definitely one to take some\ntime with and just get familiar with.\n\n199\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.110\nOkay, so let's take a look at my screen.\n\n200\n00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.010\nAnd here from within Hyper-V Manager,\n\n201\n00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:47.270\nI'm gonna go ahead and first of all you\nhave to have virtual machines, right,\n\n202\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.210\nwhat can you meter if you don't have\nmachines and then secondly you have to\n\n203\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.210\nhave, if you want to use this effectively\nyou have to have some machines running so\n\n204\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.955\nthat you can get the statistics,\nstatistical information for\n\n205\n00:11:58.955 --> 00:12:01.310\nthose machines,\nthe metrics that we're looking at.\n\n206\n00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.470\nSo I have a couple of machines powered on,\n\n207\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:08.560\nPLABDCO1 and\nour PLABWIN802 are currently running.\n\n208\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.790\nThat should give us some information\nthat we're requesting here.\n\n209\n00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.500\nSo let's just go ahead and\n\n210\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.880\npull up PowerShell on the host\noperating system here.\n\n211\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.915\nSo And let me change this a little bit so\n\n212\n00:12:21.915 --> 00:12:24.360\nwe can see what we're doing,\nI should have done this before.\n\n213\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.354\nBut, it'll just take a second.\n\n214\n00:12:29.405 --> 00:12:34.234\nAnd change that to bright white,\nokay, it's white, we can see that.\n\n215\n00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:42.305\nAll right, so the first commandlet or\ncommand that we want to use,\n\n216\n00:12:42.305 --> 00:12:46.503\nwe're gonna go ahead and type in Get-VM,\nand I'm gonna use an asterisk and\n\n217\n00:12:46.503 --> 00:12:48.750\nI'm gonna pipe that on out onto enable.\n\n218\n00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.220\nActually, let me check it first.\n\n219\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.180\nBefore I go ahead and enable it,\nit's always a good idea to just check.\n\n220\n00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.140\nSo let me check it for\na particular machine, I'll say get VN, and\n\n221\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.610\nthen I'll specify a name.\n\n222\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:08.460\nSo for this machine, we'll check it and\nsee if it's running on PLAB Win 02.\n\n223\n00:13:11.086 --> 00:13:13.036\nOkay, and when you go ahead and\n\n224\n00:13:13.036 --> 00:13:16.720\ntake the output there you can\npipe that into a format list.\n\n225\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.850\nYou can either type out format-list or\nyou can just type in an fl.\n\n226\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.390\nWhatever you want to do there.\n\n227\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.680\nAnd I'm gonna go dash and then property.\n\n228\n00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:35.770\nHere, I'm gonna also use an asterisk for a\nwildcard, just to get an actual list here.\n\n229\n00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.682\nI'm gonna make sure I got my syntax right.\n\n230\n00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:42.752\nWe've got get VM, and the name,\n\n231\n00:13:42.752 --> 00:13:47.111\nPLABWIN 02, Win 802.\n\n232\n00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:48.690\nI don't have the name of my machine right.\n\n233\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:49.952\nSo that would definitely help here.\n\n234\n00:13:49.952 --> 00:13:51.660\nMake sure everything else is good to go.\n\n235\n00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.193\nYep.\n\n236\n00:13:53.193 --> 00:13:54.620\nAll right, let me go back and change that.\n\n237\n00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:02.435\nIf I can get my cursor in the right spot.\n\n238\n00:14:02.435 --> 00:14:09.143\n[LAUGH] There we go, all right.\n\n239\n00:14:09.143 --> 00:14:12.854\nSo now I can see, and\nI'm really looking here for, and\n\n240\n00:14:12.854 --> 00:14:16.809\nagain it's hard for\nme to show you on this interface here,\n\n241\n00:14:16.809 --> 00:14:21.430\njust because I'm in a virtualization,\ninside a virtualization.\n\n242\n00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.979\nBut you can see on this first line here,\nthat resource metering enabled,\n\n243\n00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:28.298\ncurrently it's set to fault, so\nwe know that it's not enabled, but\n\n244\n00:14:28.298 --> 00:14:31.530\nwe definitely want to go ahead and\nenable it for this show.\n\n245\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.070\nSo let me just clear my screen and\nwe'll go ahead and get that enabled.\n\n246\n00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:40.200\nSo the command I'm gonna be using\nhere is going to be get dash vm,\n\n247\n00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.020\nand here we'll specify another asterisk.\n\n248\n00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.580\nAnd I'll show you also how you can\n\n249\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.940\njust use the name parameter to only\nenable it for one particular machine.\n\n250\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:57.750\nBut the command that we're gonna be using\nhere to enable is going to be enabling\n\n251\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:03.752\nour resource metering for all the VMs on\nthis particular host operating system.\n\n252\n00:15:03.752 --> 00:15:06.413\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee is that due to the wild\ncard, the asterisk that you put in there?\n\n253\n00:15:06.413 --> 00:15:09.300\nYou're basically saying get VM, all of it.\n\n254\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.870\n&gt;&gt; Right and\nif you didn't want to do that,\n\n255\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.020\nthen you could just change\nthat asterisk there.\n\n256\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.868\nI won't actually run it, but\nyou would just go ahead and, let's see.\n\n257\n00:15:21.172 --> 00:15:23.572\nYou'd specify the name.\n\n258\n00:15:23.572 --> 00:15:25.936\nAnd then so for\ninstance whatever the computer name,\n\n259\n00:15:25.936 --> 00:15:27.309\nyou would just put it in there.\n\n260\n00:15:27.309 --> 00:15:27.935\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, yep.\n\n261\n00:15:27.935 --> 00:15:28.472\n&gt;&gt; Computer name.\n\n262\n00:15:28.472 --> 00:15:29.950\nYep.\nOkay.\n\n263\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.550\nBut let me just clear out of that.\n\n264\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.730\nActually, we'll just clear the line here.\n\n265\n00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.060\nOkay, so if I wanted to go back and\n\n266\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.870\ncheck the status to see if it is\nenabled on that particular machine.\n\n267\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.920\nIs that the one where\nI spelt it correctly?\n\n268\n00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.823\nNope.\nThere we go.\n\n269\n00:15:46.823 --> 00:15:51.555\n[LAUGH] So now if we go through and check\nit, we can see here on the top line that\n\n270\n00:15:51.555 --> 00:15:56.839\nmy Resource Metering has been enabled, so\nthat's one way we could check it there.\n\n271\n00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:57.418\nPretty cool.\n\n272\n00:15:57.418 --> 00:15:59.321\nNot difficult to go ahead and set up.\n\n273\n00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:02.790\nBut enabling it really\ndoesn't do us a lot of good.\n\n274\n00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.900\nThe reason we'd wanna enable it is so\nthat we can take advantage\n\n275\n00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.980\nof the statistics that this\ntool does provide for us.\n\n276\n00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.830\nSo what do we wanna look at here?\n\n277\n00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.704\nWe verified, let's go ahead, we don't\nreally need to verify, I'll show you.\n\n278\n00:16:20.704 --> 00:16:25.942\nAnother way that we could verify,\nreal quick before I move forward,\n\n279\n00:16:25.942 --> 00:16:30.458\nis just Get-VM, and\nthen we'll take that information and\n\n280\n00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:32.830\npipe it out to Format-Table.\n\n281\n00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:40.106\nAnd you know guys, the uppercase\nreally doesn't make a difference here,\n\n282\n00:16:40.106 --> 00:16:46.921\nit's just that I like to do it that\nway sometimes to help my brain work,\n\n283\n00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:52.254\nbecause I need as much help\nas I can in that department.\n\n284\n00:16:52.254 --> 00:16:55.950\nBut it doesn't matter if it's uppercase or\nlower for the syntax.\n\n285\n00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.644\n&gt;&gt; It gets really bad when you start\nactually writing and typing that way and\n\n286\n00:16:58.644 --> 00:16:59.717\nyou're not in PowerShell.\n\n287\n00:16:59.717 --> 00:17:01.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I find myself doing that all the time.\n\n288\n00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:04.416\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well see, I can't even type here.\n\n289\n00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:08.622\nWhen I try to talk and type at the same\ntime things start to go downhill.\n\n290\n00:17:08.622 --> 00:17:14.078\nBut yeah, some of the things,\nit's like right here, exactly my point.\n\n291\n00:17:14.078 --> 00:17:17.074\nWhenever you, like regular typing,\n\n292\n00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:21.858\nyou always put a Space after a comma,\nbut not in PowerShell.\n\n293\n00:17:25.376 --> 00:17:28.598\nAll right, so for resource metering here,\nwhat else do I need enabled?\n\n294\n00:17:28.598 --> 00:17:32.585\nSo this is going to just provide the\ninformation that we saw in the previous\n\n295\n00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:36.724\ncommand line, but just in a different\nway that it'll be represented to us.\n\n296\n00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:38.452\nIn a table here you can see that.\n\n297\n00:17:38.452 --> 00:17:41.352\nSo, I've mentioned this to you before.\n\n298\n00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:45.092\nIt's all in your preference on how\nyou wanna view that information.\n\n299\n00:17:45.092 --> 00:17:51.044\nSo, I'd have to scroll on over so\nyou can see all of those columns.\n\n300\n00:17:51.044 --> 00:17:55.396\nBut it is in a base format here.\n\n301\n00:17:55.396 --> 00:17:59.508\nSo you can see for the machines,\nyou can see their state.\n\n302\n00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:03.172\nAnd you guys already know that\nI have our PLABDCO1 is running.\n\n303\n00:18:03.172 --> 00:18:05.380\nAnd our Windows802 is running.\n\n304\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:10.790\nAnd then scroll on over here to the right.\n\n305\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.690\nThe more parameters that\nyou're adding there, and\n\n306\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.570\nyou'll see as we build up on this,\nyou can really pick and\n\n307\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.800\nchoose to get a specific, so\nyou don't have to look at everything.\n\n308\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.020\nYou just wanna look at one particular\nmachine or even one particular component,\n\n309\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.720\nlike the CPU or the memory,\nyou can really define that.\n\n310\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.040\n&gt;&gt; Now, is there a default when it\ncomes to collecting the information?\n\n311\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.500\nIs there like a default, or is that\nsomething that we could modify when it\n\n312\n00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.230\ncomes to how often it\ncollects information?\n\n313\n00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.190\nOr maybe we wanna increase how\noften it collects information?\n\n314\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.050\n&gt;&gt; Actually, that's a great question Wes,\nbecause again,\n\n315\n00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.150\nit really is contingent upon what\nyour organization needs are.\n\n316\n00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.850\nSo by default resource metering will\n\n317\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.200\ncollect that information on an hourly\nbasis but we can change that.\n\n318\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.120\nLet's see, actually the command will be\nset, so let's go ahead and change that.\n\n319\n00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.970\nFor this demo let's change it to a minute,\nthat should help us.\n\n320\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:08.510\nSo we'll Set-VMHost and\nthis is going to be -ResourceMetering.\n\n321\n00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:18.366\nResource metering interval,\nour interval should be in the format,\n\n322\n00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:22.887\nwe'll go 00:01 for\none minute, and then :00.\n\n323\n00:19:22.887 --> 00:19:27.721\nSo that's the format to go ahead and\nchange it to one minute there.\n\n324\n00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:31.050\nAnd again,\nnot a whole lot of change noted.\n\n325\n00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.450\nBut if we wanted to look\nat the statistics now,\n\n326\n00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.430\nwe can just use the command like Get-VM.\n\n327\n00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:44.290\nAnd we're gonna pipe that\nout into measuring it.\n\n328\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:49.350\nSo this is going to be Measure-VM.\n\n329\n00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.760\nHit Enter and\nthen we'll see the statistical information\n\n330\n00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.090\nprovided to us here, so it's pretty cool.\n\n331\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.800\nThis is just some pretty\ngeneric information.\n\n332\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.320\nThis isn't a production environment,\nit's a lab environment, so\n\n333\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.790\nI don't have a lot running on\nthese machines and everything.\n\n334\n00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.920\nBut just like that example we\nwere talking about earlier.\n\n335\n00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.260\nWith that example you gave\nabout the SQL Server and\n\n336\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.115\nthen I forgot what other server you had\nmentioned, what services it was running.\n\n337\n00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:16.822\nBut if you look at the averages,\n\n338\n00:20:16.822 --> 00:20:20.690\nthen you can properly allocate\nthe memory within those machines there.\n\n339\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.120\nSo great tool for that.\n\n340\n00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.290\nOkay, a couple other things here.\n\n341\n00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.675\nI know we're getting close there on time.\n\n342\n00:20:31.675 --> 00:20:32.580\nWe got some time left.\n\n343\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.350\nSo what we'll do?\n\n344\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.610\nWe can set that interval.\n\n345\n00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:41.010\nWe can also take a look\nat an extensive list\n\n346\n00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.850\nof options that we could\nbe monitoring here.\n\n347\n00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.705\nSo what we'll do, or\nwhat the actual tool is metering.\n\n348\n00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:50.710\nSo to get a list we'll go ahead and\ntype out.\n\n349\n00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:55.335\nThis is going to be, make sure I got\n\n350\n00:20:55.335 --> 00:21:00.130\nthe right command here, Get-VM.\n\n351\n00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.250\nOr let's say a specific machine for\nthat domain controller,\n\n352\n00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.810\nwe'll take a look at that one.\n\n353\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:10.240\nAnd I got an extra dash here,\nI don't need that, so Get-VM -Name.\n\n354\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.300\nLet's do PLABDC01, and\nwe'll pipe that out,\n\n355\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.931\nand we'll tell it to measure that VM.\n\n356\n00:21:20.931 --> 00:21:25.785\nAnd then we'll take that output, and\n\n357\n00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.825\nthen Select-Object.\n\n358\n00:21:30.687 --> 00:21:32.270\nWe'll give it an asterisk.\n\n359\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.520\nSo you could select an individual\nobject here, like I was talking about.\n\n360\n00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.830\nBut if you wanted to look at everything\nthat it is being monitored on that\n\n361\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.760\nparticular machine,\nyou can see here I've got my CPU.\n\n362\n00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.940\nAverage CPU, average RAM,\nminimum RAM, maximum RAM.\n\n363\n00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:51.100\nSo you could say hey, look if I\ncan see that for the maximum RAM,\n\n364\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.870\nwhat it's set at,\nif this machine's never even reached\n\n365\n00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.320\nmy current maximum RAM then I could know\nto go ahead and lower that threshold.\n\n366\n00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.600\nSo just a lot of good\nstatistical information here.\n\n367\n00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.240\nGo ahead and clear that out.\n\n368\n00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.780\nYou know what?\nLet's take a look at how we could do that\n\n369\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.190\ninstead of using a wild card.\n\n370\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.700\nLet's just look at one or\ntwo particular things.\n\n371\n00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:22.110\nSo let's go VM-Name, so\nwe can display the VM name.\n\n372\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.567\nAlso we could display the average CPU.\n\n373\n00:22:25.567 --> 00:22:30.820\nSo, AVG, CPU, and average RAM.\n\n374\n00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:36.693\nSo those were just the first few\nthings we saw on that list, so AvgRAM.\n\n375\n00:22:36.693 --> 00:22:39.780\nAnd then you get it again\nin that table format.\n\n376\n00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.390\nSo if that's easier for you to look at,\n\n377\n00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:47.830\nthen you'd have to scroll on over there\nif you had additional information.\n\n378\n00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.280\nThe more comma separated values\nthat you'd be adding there.\n\n379\n00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.660\nBut what else do we need to do here?\n\n380\n00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.740\nLet's see, collecting the metrics.\n\n381\n00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.290\nYou definitely want to check to make\nsure that you disable this, like I said,\n\n382\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.610\nif you're not gonna be using it.\n\n383\n00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.094\nThere's really not a point to run it\nif you're not gonna be using it at all.\n\n384\n00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:12.421\nAnother thing to note is that this\nmachine will continue to count and\n\n385\n00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:14.390\ncompile these metrics.\n\n386\n00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:20.189\nAnd the ticker doesn't get reset\nunless you manually reset it.\n\n387\n00:23:20.189 --> 00:23:22.409\nSo I do wanna show you\nthat before we disable it.\n\n388\n00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:26.808\nSo how we would do that is just by typing,\nGet-VM, Space, and\n\n389\n00:23:26.808 --> 00:23:32.051\nlet's just use the asterisk to reset for\nall of our virtual machines here.\n\n390\n00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:37.157\nAnd then we'll pipe that into a reset,\n\n391\n00:23:37.157 --> 00:23:43.364\nif I can spell, Reset-VMResourceMetering.\n\n392\n00:23:43.364 --> 00:23:46.067\nI think that's it, yeah.\n\n393\n00:23:46.067 --> 00:23:49.977\nAnd again, not a whole lot of bells and\nwhistles to alert you to that, but you're\n\n394\n00:23:49.977 --> 00:23:53.849\nbasically just starting that clock back\nat zero there to perform the metering.\n\n395\n00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:57.254\n&gt;&gt; So let's say that I did metering,\nI was doing the resource metering for\n\n396\n00:23:57.254 --> 00:23:58.347\na little bit, right?\n\n397\n00:23:58.347 --> 00:24:01.733\nAnd maybe I was worried about the fact\nthat, it's kind of like we talked about\n\n398\n00:24:01.733 --> 00:24:05.278\nin other episodes where if you're going\nto enable security Security auditing,\n\n399\n00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:08.425\nyou better be checking the logs\nbecause they can become a performance-\n\n400\n00:24:08.425 --> 00:24:08.962\n&gt;&gt; Almost definitely.\n\n401\n00:24:08.962 --> 00:24:13.025\n&gt;&gt; Hindrance too, so what if I got to\na point maybe, Cherokee, where I was like,\n\n402\n00:24:13.025 --> 00:24:17.520\nyou know what, I've monitored it, we set\na baseline, and now I need to turn it off.\n\n403\n00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.040\nIs there a way that we could turn it off?\n\n404\n00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.760\n&gt;&gt; You know that's a really\ngreat question, Wes.\n\n405\n00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.640\nOf course there is a way we can do that,\nwe'll just go ahead and\n\n406\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.800\ncontinue to use PowerShell.\n\n407\n00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.650\nThat's really the only way\nthat we can do that, again,\n\n408\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.010\nwe don't have that graphical\nuser interface here.\n\n409\n00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.090\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nlet's see.\n\n410\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:36.320\nThe command that we'll be\nusing is going to be get-VM.\n\n411\n00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.470\nAnd for this one,\nwe're gonna take that information, again,\n\n412\n00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:44.715\npipe it on out to a disable this time and\n\n413\n00:24:44.715 --> 00:24:49.360\n-VM resource and then,\nlet's see if I can tab on through.\n\n414\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.310\nNot if you don't spell it right.\n\n415\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.470\nIt never works that way, does it?\n\n416\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.770\nThere we go, all right, so you know, hey,\n\n417\n00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:04.780\nI don't know if it's been disabled or\nnot, so let's check it.\n\n418\n00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.210\nSo we'll just type in get VM,\nagain pipe that information out, and\n\n419\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:16.370\nagain what we'll be looking at here is for\nformat table, format-table, and\n\n420\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.690\nlet's specify the name in this table, so\nI'm telling the table what to provide me.\n\n421\n00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:26.140\nThe state of whatever it is I'm checking\nand here I'm gonna to be checking my\n\n422\n00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:33.730\nresource metering for enable.\n\n423\n00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:34.360\nWe'll hit enter.\n\n424\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.500\nAll right, so\nlet's see here if I scroll on over, just\n\n425\n00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:50.160\ngive me a second There we go.\n\n426\n00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.926\nGot my little gray bar.\n\n427\n00:25:53.604 --> 00:25:58.610\nScrolling all the way over to the\nright-hand side there, you can see that\n\n428\n00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:04.640\nresource enabling has been disabled so\nit give us that false parameter there.\n\n429\n00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.620\nThis column just shows us the state of the\nmachine as in if it's running or not, but\n\n430\n00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.780\nover here it shows if that actual\nservice is being utilized.\n\n431\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.470\nSo that's what we'll be looking for there.\n\n432\n00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.850\nAs far as resource metering goes,\nthat's it for\n\n433\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.390\nthis demonstration but you can\ndefinitely use it in a number of ways.\n\n434\n00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.210\nJust the examples that Wes and I, we just\nkind of came up with them on the fly,\n\n435\n00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.220\nbut if you get creative with it then you\ncan really take advantage of this tool.\n\n436\n00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.360\n&gt;&gt; And what I like about it is you said\nthat we don't have a button for that, so\n\n437\n00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.900\nyou dropped right down to PowerShell and\n\n438\n00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.910\nyou took care of what\nneeded to be taken care of.\n\n439\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.637\nAnd that's what I like about PowerShell,\nis that we don't have to wait for\n\n440\n00:26:43.637 --> 00:26:44.733\nthem to code a button to do it.\n\n441\n00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:47.621\nThey give us all the tools,\nwe just have to know the syntax and well,\n\n442\n00:26:47.621 --> 00:26:49.344\nif you have ever seen\nsome of my typing and\n\n443\n00:26:49.344 --> 00:26:52.655\nmaybe you've seen some of my episodes\nyou now syntax is everything, right?\n\n444\n00:26:52.655 --> 00:26:54.600\n&gt;&gt; Mine too [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, great episode.\n\n445\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.821\nA lot of great demonstrations.\n\n446\n00:26:55.821 --> 00:26:58.275\nIt does look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, but\n\n447\n00:26:58.275 --> 00:26:59.041\nbefore we sign out.\n\n448\n00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:02.356\nDo you got any additional words when it\ncomes to just some of the things that you\n\n449\n00:27:02.356 --> 00:27:03.230\ncan do with the VMs.\n\n450\n00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are a couple other\n\n451\n00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.770\nsettings that we need to take\na look at how to configure.\n\n452\n00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.870\nSo you definitely wanna come back and\ncheck those out.\n\n453\n00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.370\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, we look forward\nto seeing you in this episode.\n\n454\n00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.956\nWe look forward to seeing you the viewer,\nbut\n\n455\n00:27:13.956 --> 00:27:15.385\nyou're gonna have to tune in and watch.\n\n456\n00:27:15.385 --> 00:27:18.020\nSigning out for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n457\n00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:18.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n458\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.045\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:27:21.045 -->

00:00:08.259\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.927\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:13.212\n&gt;&gt; Hello to all our viewers out there.\n\n6\n00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:16.137\nWelcome back to another great\nepisode here in ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:17.019\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.871\nAnd in today's episode, what are we doing?\n\n9\n00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:22.393\nWell, we're continuing through\nour series in the 70-410 exam.\n\n10\n00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:23.027\nThat's right.\n\n11\n00:00:23.027 --> 00:00:24.812\nThe MCSA in Windows Server 2012 and\n\n12\n00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:27.855\njoining us back in the studio is\nnone other than Ms Cherokee Booze.\n\n13\n00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:28.823\nCherokee, how are you doing today?\n\n14\n00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:30.958\n&gt;&gt; I'm being wonderful, thank you for\nasking, Wes, how are you?\n\n15\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:31.970\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n16\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.971\nIt's been great to be here, we've been\ntalking about things like Hyper-V,\n\n17\n00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:37.062\nwe've been talking about Virtual Machines,\nright,\n\n18\n00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:40.061\ndifferent ways that you, well how do you\nget Hyper-V online, get it ready and\n\n19\n00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:42.210\nthen how do you create Virtual Machines,\nright?\n\n20\n00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.760\nWe've seen it through\nthe Graphical User Interface, as well as,\n\n21\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.710\nwell we've gotten into down\nthe command line interface, right?\n\n22\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.330\nMicrosoft loves power, so we've look at\nsome of the ways that you could do this\n\n23\n00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.420\ndifferent manipulations if you will,\nor configurations.\n\n24\n00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.479\nI don't know if you\nshould say manipulations.\n\n25\n00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.568\n[LAUGH] Configurations inside of\nthe PowerShell, the command line.\n\n26\n00:00:57.568 --> 00:01:00.627\nBut we have some additional\nconsiderations that we need to look at.\n\n27\n00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.453\nSo where are we going to start\nout in this one Cherokee?\n\n28\n00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:07.128\n&gt;&gt; Sure Wes, I think that piggybacking\noff of some of those previous\n\n29\n00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:11.810\nconfigurations will lead us\ninto enhanced session mode.\n\n30\n00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.510\nSo, we talked about our guest\nintegration services previously.\n\n31\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.000\nSo if we go ahead and set that up and\n\n32\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.870\nhave it enabled then that'll allow us\nto also enable enhanced session mode.\n\n33\n00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.549\nIf we take a look at my screen, I wanna\nshow something here and I don't know if\n\n34\n00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.327\nthis image looks familiar to you Wes but-\n&gt;&gt; I've seen that once or twice.\n\n35\n00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:33.394\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I took it\nfrom one of your shows.\n\n36\n00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:37.219\nBut if we think about this ideology of\njust implementing VDI versus desktop\n\n37\n00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.044\ninfrastructure some of you who might\nhave been in the field for a long time,\n\n38\n00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:44.383\nmaybe you still use the terminology\njust like a terminal server,\n\n39\n00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:46.771\nwith your terminals, your dummy terminals.\n\n40\n00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:52.479\nOr you might say, your 10 clients, or\nwhatever, if you think about this idea,\n\n41\n00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.029\nthe end users in this kind of setup\nmay want to take advantage, and\n\n42\n00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:01.833\nleverage their local peripheral devices,\nand if you're utilizing\n\n43\n00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:07.251\nvirtualization in a design like this\nin the past that wasn't a possibility.\n\n44\n00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:12.718\nBut by taking advantage of enhanced\nsession mode, and I install integration\n\n45\n00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:17.680\nservices, a VMBus has been created\nthat will allow that connection,\n\n46\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.223\nthat communication to my local\nmachine allowing access to local\n\n47\n00:02:22.223 --> 00:02:26.535\nperipherals such as printers,\nand USB drives and so forth.\n\n48\n00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:30.289\n&gt;&gt; And that sounds handy cause I know that\nobviously if you're in some kind of VDI\n\n49\n00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.812\nsolutions it's not like you can just\nwalk over to the server closet, and\n\n50\n00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:37.046\nsneakernet into one of the local\nUSB ports on the host machine, and\n\n51\n00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:39.402\nhook up maybe a printer or\nsomething like that.\n\n52\n00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:43.393\nSo, seems like it would be convenient to\nbe able to have access to local ports,\n\n53\n00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.062\nif you will.\n\n54\n00:02:44.062 --> 00:02:47.120\nThings like your printers,\nif you will, on your local machines.\n\n55\n00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.994\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you can see here,\n\n56\n00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:49.536\nI just threw that up there\nwhile you were talking.\n\n57\n00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.019\nJust a few of the examples we've got.\n\n58\n00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.419\nLocal drives, we have USB devices,\nprinters, audio devices,\n\n59\n00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.581\naccess to the clipboard, too.\n\n60\n00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:02.739\nThat's really a cool feature, too, because\nin the past you'd actually have to remote\n\n61\n00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.351\ninto those machines if you wanted to\ntake advantage of something like that.\n\n62\n00:03:06.351 --> 00:03:11.543\nBut no, here you can still utilize smart\ncards, plug and play devices and even\n\n63\n00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:16.750\nanother cool option here is to go ahead\nand change the display configuration.\n\n64\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.725\nSo we didn't really have that\ncapability in the pack so\n\n65\n00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:23.486\nthis is pretty cool to take advantage\nof that enhanced session mode.\n\n66\n00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:27.007\nThe thing is though, we're gonna\nhave to have that installed and\n\n67\n00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:30.093\nconfigured on both the server\nside as well as the client.\n\n68\n00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:34.601\nSo if we're talking about running\nHyper-V on server 2012 R2,\n\n69\n00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.910\nby default it is not installed.\n\n70\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.030\nBut if we're running Hyper-V,\n\n71\n00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.760\nclient Hyper-V on like Windows 8.1\nthen by default it is installed.\n\n72\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.798\nSo just a little difference there.\n\n73\n00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:48.299\nBut I'll show you how we can do that here\nif I can pull up our lab environment.\n\n74\n00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.951\nSo just to minimize that, there we go.\n\n75\n00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:54.744\nLet's start with the server and\ngo ahead and configure right there.\n\n76\n00:03:54.744 --> 00:03:58.304\nSo over on the righthand side and\nI know it's kind of small here but\n\n77\n00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:01.060\nlet me just navigate on over there.\n\n78\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.830\nIf we pull for\nHyper-V settings over on the right pane,\n\n79\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.898\nthis is going to be the section where\nwe need to go ahead and configure this.\n\n80\n00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:16.420\nSo the first thing that we're going to see\non the left side is enhanced session mode.\n\n81\n00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.110\nAnd it really is as simple as just setting\nthis tick box here, check box, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.234\nSo we'll go ahead and select OK for that.\n\n83\n00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:29.786\nNow, let's say for\nthis machine here, PLABWIN802.\n\n84\n00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:33.725\nThis is a client of Virtual Machine,\nand maybe we are running in that VDI\n\n85\n00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:37.350\ninfrastructure and this is going\nto be our client, our end user.\n\n86\n00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.574\nSo we need to configure them as well.\n\n87\n00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:42.573\nWe can just right click and\nthen again, pull up our settings for\n\n88\n00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:43.715\nthat Virtual Machine.\n\n89\n00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:52.380\nOkay, so we do need to make sure that\nour Integration Services is enabled.\n\n90\n00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.820\nSo, again, let's go ahead and\njust make sure that that's on.\n\n91\n00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.359\nAnd we'll hit OK.\n\n92\n00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:03.530\nNow sometimes a reboot is needed\nin order to get this initiated,\n\n93\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.670\na reboot of that virtual machine,\nbut not always.\n\n94\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.540\nSo let's go ahead and just try to pull\nthis machine up and powered on here, and\n\n95\n00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.160\nsee if we are able to take advantage\nof that enhanced session mode.\n\n96\n00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.210\nThe first thing you should notice is going\nto be the display option that it's gonna\n\n97\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.340\ntry to say hey,\nwhat size would like for your display?\n\n98\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.392\nAnd that would be the first clue.\n\n99\n00:05:30.392 --> 00:05:35.365\nLet's give it a second here And\nthere we go, and\n\n100\n00:05:35.365 --> 00:05:36.905\nthat's exactly what I am talking about.\n\n101\n00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:40.752\nSo, we didn't have to perform any\nadditional reboots, it worked just fine.\n\n102\n00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:44.547\nSo, we'll keep the defaults for\nthe display, but\n\n103\n00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:47.733\nthere are a few other\noptions here as well.\n\n104\n00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:51.094\nIf you had additional monitors, you could\ngo ahead and take advantage of that.\n\n105\n00:05:51.094 --> 00:05:55.395\nI know I love using multiple\nmonitors here in the office.\n\n106\n00:05:55.395 --> 00:05:58.799\n&gt;&gt; That seems like an interesting feature\ntoo because once you've worked with\n\n107\n00:05:58.799 --> 00:06:01.628\ndual monitors it's kind of hard\nto go back to a single monitor.\n\n108\n00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:04.065\nIt's almost like you're\nwalking with a crutch.\n\n109\n00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:07.311\nSo it's nice that they allow you to\nthat ability once you turn this on or\n\n110\n00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.850\nactually spread that Virtual Machine\nexperience across the two monitors.\n\n111\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.745\nI can see where, from an end user\nperspective maybe not the admin\n\n112\n00:06:13.745 --> 00:06:16.746\nperspective that that makes your\nend user a little bit more happy,\n\n113\n00:06:16.746 --> 00:06:19.502\na little less complains, and\na little bit more productive.\n\n114\n00:06:19.502 --> 00:06:20.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely.\n\n115\n00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.818\nBecause I mean, you're already spent the\nmoney, why not take advantage of that and\n\n116\n00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:26.890\nuse your equipment in a smart way there.\n\n117\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.843\nAnd let's go ahead and take a look at some\nadditional options that we have here.\n\n118\n00:06:31.843 --> 00:06:36.048\nSo in this other tab it says local\nresources so let's check that out.\n\n119\n00:06:36.048 --> 00:06:37.760\nNow I'll zoom in a little bit.\n\n120\n00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.900\nNow when it talks about remote audio this\nwas something that wasn't possible with\n\n121\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.260\nvirtualization in the past and\nthat's pretty cool.\n\n122\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.096\nYou have the ability to go ahead and\nconfigure.\n\n123\n00:06:47.096 --> 00:06:52.344\nBoth play back and recording options so\nyou can just you know run\n\n124\n00:06:52.344 --> 00:06:58.596\nthrough that local hardware utilizing\nthat VMBus and have access to that.\n\n125\n00:06:58.596 --> 00:07:01.672\nSo we'll just do that,\nput this thing here.\n\n126\n00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:06.633\nPrinters, okay, you have the ability to go\nahead and redirect those printers as well.\n\n127\n00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:10.493\nWhich is really nice because if you're\naccessing shared data on a server,\n\n128\n00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:14.536\nreports or forms or something and you want\nto print it out locally at your desk,\n\n129\n00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:17.136\nthen there you go,\nyou don't even have to get up.\n\n130\n00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:21.331\nAlso the clipboard option,\nas well, we talked about that.\n\n131\n00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:26.435\nNow, by default,\nsmart cards are enabled, drives are not.\n\n132\n00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:28.661\nYou can go ahead and expand those out.\n\n133\n00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:33.103\nAnd we'll see a few different\ndrives that I have here.\n\n134\n00:07:33.103 --> 00:07:35.203\nNow there's also this option.\n\n135\n00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:37.840\nI kinda wanna point out and\nshow you the behavior here.\n\n136\n00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.429\nIf I were to pick and\nchoose selectively, then that's fine.\n\n137\n00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:45.449\nBut if I get this top option here and\nselect that and\n\n138\n00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:49.010\nfill it in It will check all of them for\nme.\n\n139\n00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.420\nAnd I just want to keep that in mind.\n\n140\n00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.439\nPoint it out to you because also\ndrives that you plug in later.\n\n141\n00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:58.120\nSo like flash drives, USB drives,\nwhatever kind of like external.\n\n142\n00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.990\nSo that is an option there.\n\n143\n00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.099\nIf you don't want that of course,\nyou can deselect it, as well.\n\n144\n00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:07.855\nAnd that's going to be the same down\nhere for this additional option, for\n\n145\n00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:09.627\nour plug and play devices.\n\n146\n00:08:09.627 --> 00:08:11.065\nIf you select the other,\n\n147\n00:08:11.065 --> 00:08:15.390\nthen it defaults automatically to that\ndefault slide I'll plug in later.\n\n148\n00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.525\nSo if you don't expand that out\njust noted that will happen there.\n\n149\n00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:22.255\n&gt;&gt; And that's a very interesting screen\ncuz I've actually seen that screen before.\n\n150\n00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:25.505\nAnd if you've ever worked with things like\nremote desktop connection, that's some of\n\n151\n00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:28.635\nthe additional local resources on\nthe tab that's within remote desktop.\n\n152\n00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:30.663\nSo it's interesting,\nI wonder if underneath,\n\n153\n00:08:30.663 --> 00:08:33.983\nif they didn't slide in some of the remote\ndesktop architecture there as well.\n\n154\n00:08:33.983 --> 00:08:35.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I tell you,\n\n155\n00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:37.691\nit's kinda interesting\nif you think about it.\n\n156\n00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:39.219\nJust for plug and play in general, right?\n\n157\n00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:41.273\nPlug and play means, you need to have.\n\n158\n00:08:41.273 --> 00:08:43.690\nWhen you plug the device in, right,\nwhat is the operating system do?\n\n159\n00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.410\nIt looks down to the local\ndriver store and\n\n160\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.390\nit says, I found that driver,\nI found the class identifier.\n\n161\n00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.040\nLet's go ahead and we'll install\nthe driver, we'll get it working and\n\n162\n00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.092\nthen you don't have to worry\nabout having that driver.\n\n163\n00:08:53.092 --> 00:08:55.599\nWell, I can Imagine like you've\ntold us in other episodes,\n\n164\n00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:58.941\none of the things that you don't see all\nthese roles installed because they wanna\n\n165\n00:08:58.941 --> 00:09:00.875\nkeep that security footprint small, right?\n\n166\n00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:02.778\nYou wanna save those resources for\n\n167\n00:09:02.778 --> 00:09:05.999\nexactly where they're needed and\njust add what you want.\n\n168\n00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:10.076\nSo I can see where having to support\nthings like hundreds, and hundreds,\n\n169\n00:09:10.076 --> 00:09:12.905\nand hundreds if not thousands\nof different plug and\n\n170\n00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:17.049\nplay devices on the server side might\ncause a little bit more utilization of\n\n171\n00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:20.051\nthe server in the areas that\nwe really don't want it.\n\n172\n00:09:20.051 --> 00:09:24.471\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, Wes, we could even\ntake advantage of those cool little\n\n173\n00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:28.335\nUSB devices like a fan or something,\nlike my coffee cup heater.\n\n174\n00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:32.746\nSo yeah, anyways,\nall those plug and play devices.\n\n175\n00:09:32.746 --> 00:09:36.072\nOne thing I did want to show you, if we\ncan take a look at my screen real quick.\n\n176\n00:09:36.072 --> 00:09:39.957\nI have the ability to go ahead and save\nthose display settings as well there if\n\n177\n00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:42.580\nyou didn't want to change\nthat every single time.\n\n178\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.580\nAlso we do have a little button,\n\n179\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.260\nI just wanna show you where that\nis right up here at the top.\n\n180\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.110\nYou can toggle back and\nforth between enhanced session and\n\n181\n00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.090\nyour basic session as well there.\n\n182\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.850\nSo it is gonna ask me to go ahead and\nconnect the first time.\n\n183\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.670\nBut just to let you know that that's\nwhat that little button does for you.\n\n184\n00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.730\nIt toggles between the two back and forth.\n\n185\n00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.993\nSo if you didn't wanna\nhave those features,\n\n186\n00:10:06.993 --> 00:10:08.725\nthen you could easily take it off.\n\n187\n00:10:08.725 --> 00:10:12.645\nOr alternatively, you could just\ndisable that within the settings for\n\n188\n00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:16.270\nthe integration services or\nenhanced mode on the server side.\n\n189\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.480\nSo either way,\nyou got a couple different options there.\n\n190\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.880\nAll right, Wes, so the next thing I wanna\ntalk about is going to be RemoteFX.\n\n191\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.540\nSo RemoteFX is going to be one of those\nthings that it might not be perfect for\n\n192\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.770\neveryone, not everyone may always need to\nuse this, but just knowing it's there,\n\n193\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.250\nknowing it's available.\n\n194\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.300\nSo what does it do?\n\n195\n00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.750\nWell, RemoteFX is going to allow\nus to leverage the physical.\n\n196\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:48.160\nIf I have a server and I have the actual\nGPU, a graphical processing unit,\n\n197\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.670\nthen I can take advantage of that\non my Virtual Machines as well.\n\n198\n00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:57.371\nSo I'm gonna be offloading those\ngraphical components from the CPU,\n\n199\n00:10:57.371 --> 00:11:00.955\nto that GPU, just to improve performance.\n\n200\n00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:04.148\n&gt;&gt; Now that's an interesting concept\nthere, because one of the things I\n\n201\n00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:07.560\nknow that we really don't care about\ntoo much on the server side is, well,\n\n202\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.150\ngraphical performance, right?\n\n203\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.749\nWell a lot of times at best\nyou have a VGA socket, and\n\n204\n00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:14.971\nall we have to do is sneak her net\naround with the KBM and plug in.\n\n205\n00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:18.273\nSo I can imagine that one of\nthe requirements it probably gonna be\n\n206\n00:11:18.273 --> 00:11:21.209\nsomething you have to take\ninto consideration, is hey,\n\n207\n00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:23.899\nam I gonna go ahead and\ntake one of those PCIE slots and\n\n208\n00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:28.202\nactually install a graphics card in order\nto support something like this, right?\n\n209\n00:11:28.202 --> 00:11:33.433\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\neven though here we've seen the heavy use,\n\n210\n00:11:33.433 --> 00:11:37.120\nif I can't even talk, of PowerShell.\n\n211\n00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.211\nWhere we don't even need\nany graphical components.\n\n212\n00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:40.063\nIt's just a CLI.\n\n213\n00:11:40.063 --> 00:11:43.520\nSo like I said it's not ideal for\neveryone, but maybe for\n\n214\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.950\nsome reason you're utilizing some kind\nof software, any kind of CAD software.\n\n215\n00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.750\nAnd you really don't wanna\nslow down your system with\n\n216\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.810\nany kind of graphics running on that CPU.\n\n217\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.021\nThat's, I think,\nwhere you would find the best use.\n\n218\n00:11:57.021 --> 00:11:59.202\n&gt;&gt; And if there's, and\nif I remember right,\n\n219\n00:11:59.202 --> 00:12:03.216\nthings like Windows 7 has the Aero\ninterface, and it's a flashy interface.\n\n220\n00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:05.086\nAnd maybe they wanna support\nsomething like that.\n\n221\n00:12:05.086 --> 00:12:08.428\nFor me personally I like\nto save those resources for\n\n222\n00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:10.690\nother important functionality.\n\n223\n00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.815\nBut hey, that's why they call it PC right,\npersonal computing.\n\n224\n00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:16.460\nCuz it's a personal experience so maybe\nthat is, maybe you wanna make it a little\n\n225\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.190\nbit more flashy for somebody and\nthey wanna support the Aero interface.\n\n226\n00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.971\nTraditionally, like I said within our\nserver products, we don't have graphical\n\n227\n00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:28.605\nuser interfaces just like you\nalready mentioned that, GPUs.\n\n228\n00:12:28.605 --> 00:12:33.156\nSo it's interesting that you just have to\nkeep that in mind that, A, does my server\n\n229\n00:12:33.156 --> 00:12:37.005\nhave a GPU, cuz it's gonna need one\nof those in order to support this.\n\n230\n00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:39.048\nSo are there any other things that we\nhave to worry about when it comes to\n\n231\n00:12:39.048 --> 00:12:39.891\nthe requirements for that?\n\n232\n00:12:39.891 --> 00:12:41.400\n&gt;&gt; There are a few other requirements Wes.\n\n233\n00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.198\nOf course you have to have that GPU,\notherwise there's nothing to pull upon and\n\n234\n00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:47.040\nactually take advantage off.\n\n235\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.764\nOn the client's side there you\nalso need to have slots for\n\n236\n00:12:49.764 --> 00:12:51.706\nthe second level address translation.\n\n237\n00:12:51.706 --> 00:12:56.126\nAgain, with that i5, i7 later processors\nthere should be good to go but\n\n238\n00:12:56.126 --> 00:12:58.495\nsome something you might wanna check.\n\n239\n00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:03.203\nAnd there's also going to be a role that\nwe need to install on the server side\n\n240\n00:13:03.203 --> 00:13:03.812\nas well.\n\n241\n00:13:03.812 --> 00:13:06.954\nSo if we take a look at my screen\nI'll show you where we can do that.\n\n242\n00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:10.245\nLet me just minimize our\nHyper-V Manager pulled up.\n\n243\n00:13:10.245 --> 00:13:13.795\nBut if we go under Add roles and\nfeatures section here,\n\n244\n00:13:13.795 --> 00:13:18.385\nit's actually a sub set of\nthe remote desktop services roles.\n\n245\n00:13:18.385 --> 00:13:21.500\nSo let's just go ahead and\nclick through this welcome page.\n\n246\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.428\nI'm gonna zoom out a little bit so\nwe can fit it on the screen, there we go.\n\n247\n00:13:25.428 --> 00:13:27.168\nAll right, and just click Next and\n\n248\n00:13:27.168 --> 00:13:29.871\nnext we're doing that up\nright here on this machine.\n\n249\n00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:34.867\nAll right, scrolling down to our\nRemote desktop services section.\n\n250\n00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:37.920\nAll right, so we'll just go ahead and\nhit Next here.\n\n251\n00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.030\nSo we're really looking for\n\n252\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.960\nthat sub feature that we'll see\ncoming up on this next page here.\n\n253\n00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.060\nSo the one that we're gonna be looking for\n\n254\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.402\nis that\nRemote Desktop Virtualization Host.\n\n255\n00:13:48.402 --> 00:13:52.595\nSo server side,\nthat's what we wanna make sure is enabled.\n\n256\n00:13:52.595 --> 00:13:56.772\nWe can hit Add Features, and\nthen just go ahead and continue with that.\n\n257\n00:13:56.772 --> 00:13:58.770\nAnd get that installed.\n\n258\n00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.351\nBut we're not finished yet.\n\n259\n00:14:00.351 --> 00:14:04.894\nThere is another option that we\nhave to go ahead and set here.\n\n260\n00:14:04.894 --> 00:14:08.609\nOn the right-hand side, once that\ninstalls, let me just minimize that.\n\n261\n00:14:08.609 --> 00:14:12.279\nBecause if we go back\ninto our Hyper-V Manager,\n\n262\n00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.820\nI think I just minimized it from before.\n\n263\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.842\nJust trying to, yeah, there it is.\n\n264\n00:14:19.842 --> 00:14:22.671\nAll right, on the right-hand pane,\nso while that's installing,\n\n265\n00:14:22.671 --> 00:14:25.230\nI'm just showing you where you\nwould go ahead and do that.\n\n266\n00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.800\nBut there is another setting over here\nunder Hyper-V settings that we have\n\n267\n00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.910\nto make sure is enabled as well.\n\n268\n00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.653\nAnd let me just pull that over so\nwe can see it.\n\n269\n00:14:36.602 --> 00:14:41.013\nOkay, so over on the left-hand side,\n\n270\n00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:46.101\nlet me see where's my\nremote physical GPUs?\n\n271\n00:14:46.101 --> 00:14:50.452\nNow this is going to be kind of tricky\nWes because I actually don't have\n\n272\n00:14:50.452 --> 00:14:51.790\na physical GPU here.\n\n273\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:56.010\nBut if I did this is where it would be and\nyou can drop down from this\n\n274\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.820\naction menu here and\nselect the GPU that you wanna attach for\n\n275\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.650\nthe RemoteFX since I don't, it's gonna\nbe hard to go ahead and show that.\n\n276\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.580\nBut also on the client side,\nyou'll see those options.\n\n277\n00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.110\nI'll show you where they are, they're\ngonna be grayed out, but that's okay,\n\n278\n00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.210\nat least if we see them.\n\n279\n00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.700\nSo back in Hyper-V there, you can\nright-click on top of the machine, and\n\n280\n00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.160\ngo to Settings.\n\n281\n00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.660\nAnd It's going to be under\nthe add hardware option, so\n\n282\n00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.750\nit's already up here selected by default,\nthey're under add hardware.\n\n283\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:32.835\nAnd you can see that my RemoteFX\n3D video adapter is grayed out.\n\n284\n00:15:32.835 --> 00:15:34.945\nBut if it were not grayed out,\n\n285\n00:15:34.945 --> 00:15:39.245\nthen I would be able to go ahead and\nadd that if I had that physical GPU there.\n\n286\n00:15:39.245 --> 00:15:41.135\nSo it's not difficult to install,\n\n287\n00:15:41.135 --> 00:15:44.600\nyou just have to make sure that\nyou have those prerequisites, and\n\n288\n00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.200\nthen you'll be good to go and I can where\nthose prerequisite, exam alert, hint hint.\n\n289\n00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.944\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n290\n00:15:49.944 --> 00:15:51.131\n&gt;&gt; That might be something\nthat's on the exam.\n\n291\n00:15:51.131 --> 00:15:53.360\nSo remember Direct X.\n\n292\n00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.070\nRemember second level address translation,\nright?\n\n293\n00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.120\nIt is important because you know if\nthey throw you into a scenario where you\n\n294\n00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.870\nneed to support and\nconfigure this type of role or service.\n\n295\n00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.980\nIf you're not aware of it well and\nyou have the potential to get those wrong.\n\n296\n00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.750\nSo you definitely need to keep some of\nthese things that Cherokee is mentioning\n\n297\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.720\nhere about just the additional\nconfigurations,\n\n298\n00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.030\nwhen it comes to getting these\nVirtual Machines up and running.\n\n299\n00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.410\nNow it does look like we're coming to the\nend of another episode here, Cherokee, but\n\n300\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:19.950\nbefore we do,\n\n301\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.360\ndo you have any final words when it comes\nto just General configurations, right?\n\n302\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.410\nWe've had a lot of episodes here,\nwhen it talks about VM configuration,\n\n303\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.850\nand Hyper-V in general.\n\n304\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.065\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there were quite a few, so\njust being familiar with everything that\n\n305\n00:16:31.065 --> 00:16:34.282\nwe covered here in the show is a great\nfoundation, and of course as always,\n\n306\n00:16:34.282 --> 00:16:37.804\njust take the time to go through and make\nsure you understand what everything means\n\n307\n00:16:37.804 --> 00:16:39.579\nwithin the operating system\n&gt;&gt; System,\n\n308\n00:16:39.579 --> 00:16:43.594\nyou gotta get hands on there but\nI think we're ready to move on to storage.\n\n309\n00:16:43.594 --> 00:16:44.259\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n310\n00:16:44.259 --> 00:16:45.875\nAnd I can't wait to see those episodes.\n\n311\n00:16:45.875 --> 00:16:47.916\nThank you for jumping in here and\nlending your expertise.\n\n312\n00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:51.218\nAnd we thank you the viewer watching,\nsigning out for ITPro.TV.\n\n313\n00:16:51.218 --> 00:16:52.507\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n314\n00:16:52.507 --> 00:16:53.220\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n315\n00:16:53.220 -->

live from San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:06.057\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:06.057 --> 00:00:07.636\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:11.434\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:13.420\n&gt;&gt; Hello to our viewers out there.\n\n7\n00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.840\nThanks for tuning in at ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Wes Bryant.\n\n8\n00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.790\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series in 7410.\n\n9\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.180\nThat's right, the MCSA,\nand Windows Server 2012,\n\n10\n00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.940\nand joining us back in the studios\nis Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.010\nCherokee, how you doing today?\n\n12\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.460\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, thank you for asking.\n\n13\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.210\n&gt;&gt; All right, great.\n\n14\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.980\nSo, over the last couple of episodes,\nwe've been diving into Hyper-V,\n\n15\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.310\ntalking about the hypervisors and\nthe virtual machines, right?\n\n16\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.940\nWell, one of the things that we didn't\ntalk about is those virtual machines,\n\n17\n00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.870\nwhen you create them.\n\n18\n00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.840\nIt's a logical instance of a machine,\nbut where does it store data?\n\n19\n00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.790\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode.\n\n20\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.470\nWe're gonna be talking a little bit about\nhow to create and configure VM storage.\n\n21\n00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.760\nSo Cherokee,\nwhere do we start with that topic?\n\n22\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.857\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well Wes,\n\n23\n00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:57.840\nwith virtualization here we really see\nin Hyper-V two specific types of files.\n\n24\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.599\nSo we're actually working with files that\nare essentially our hard drives here\n\n25\n00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:06.803\nbecause we don't have physical hard\ndrives in our virtual machines.\n\n26\n00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:10.248\nOur host is harboring that physical drive,\ncreating a file and\n\n27\n00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:13.270\nthat's how we access that information.\n\n28\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.740\nIn different virtualization solutions,\nyou have different file extensions.\n\n29\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.570\nHere within Hyper-V, we have VHD and VHDX.\n\n30\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.360\nSo VHD is going to be the older of the\ntwo, you'll see some limitations there,\n\n31\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.800\nmost notably being storage.\n\n32\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.550\nWhen I think a Virtual PC came into\nthe game and Microsoft had acquired that\n\n33\n00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.040\norganization, they really\nadopted that VHD file.\n\n34\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.025\nBut you had that 2 terabyte\nlimit whereas with a newer\n\n35\n00:01:43.025 --> 00:01:48.440\nVHDX file extension,\nyou have a 64 terabyte limit.\n\n36\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.990\nSo that's gonna be a huge difference when\nyou're looking at comparison in sizes.\n\n37\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.410\nBut let's take a look at my screen,\n\n38\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.950\nwe'll talk about some of\nthe other differences as well.\n\n39\n00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.530\nSo with our VHD files,\nthose are going to have a little bit less\n\n40\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.390\nof the ability to handle any kind of\ncorruption with those types of files.\n\n41\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.740\nEspecially when we're talking\nany kind of power loss.\n\n42\n00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.790\nVHDX also handled those better.\n\n43\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.770\nVHDX files also are able to really\nhandle larger sectored disks as well.\n\n44\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.200\nAnd I'm talking about also dynamically\nexpanding disks and being able to just\n\n45\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.890\nhandle those differencing disks\nin a better capacity as well.\n\n46\n00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.970\nThere are some limitations, though.\n\n47\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.910\nVHDX is going to be supported\nin only Gen 2 machines, so\n\n48\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.670\nthat's something that we do\nhave to think about there.\n\n49\n00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.010\nThere is a conversion allowed\nbetween VHD to VHDX and vice versa.\n\n50\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.470\nBut you can't fool the operating\nsystem into thinking, okay,\n\n51\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.220\nif I had an original VHD\nfile converted to VHDX.\n\n52\n00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.220\nIt's still not gonna work well\nin that VM Gen 2 machine.\n\n53\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.450\n&gt;&gt; And it sounds like they're trying to\nbring that into alignment with a lot of\n\n54\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.940\nthe newer technologies that we see.\n\n55\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.720\nYou mention VHDX only being part\nof Gen 2 in an earlier episode.\n\n56\n00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.650\nYou told us that the Gen 2 is\nwhere you could take advantages of\n\n57\n00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.290\nthings like UEFI and\nits Secure Boot, right?\n\n58\n00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.650\nAnd well,\nthose are all industry-wide standards now.\n\n59\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.750\nAnd you talk about the larger drive\ncapacity, 64 terabytes, right?\n\n60\n00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.900\nYou might say my gosh that's\na lot information, 64 terabytes.\n\n61\n00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.310\nWell it's kinda interesting that you say\nthat, I was just reading a news article,\n\n62\n00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.530\nand today in fact.\n\n63\n00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.060\nWhat is today's date?\n\n64\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.680\nWe're in October of 2017 anyhow and\n\n65\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.310\nSeagate just came out with a drive\nthat's 12 terabytes in size, one drive.\n\n66\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.380\nSo you can see that these drives\nare getting larger and larger.\n\n67\n00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.170\nSo it's definitely a good\nthing that they've taken and\n\n68\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.720\nthey've even expanded it beyond some of\nthe limitations we see with their VHD and\n\n69\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.082\nthe earlier two terabyte\nlimitation that they have.\n\n70\n00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:52.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, and also we're talking about\ncloud storage with virtualization here.\n\n71\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.970\nAnd I think the main reason why they\nwanted to ensure that capability, some of\n\n72\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.450\nthe Azure services still require VHD files\nwhich I see that changing in the future.\n\n73\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.390\nBut for now, I think that's another reason\nwhy that compatibility exists as well.\n\n74\n00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.968\n&gt;&gt; And most definitely, cuz you got people\nout there that are still running XP.\n\n75\n00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:12.303\nYou know who you are out there, right?\n\n76\n00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:13.558\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:15.192\n&gt;&gt; XP came out in 2001, so\n\n78\n00:04:15.192 --> 00:04:19.807\nit's been around for a very long time and\npeople, they like what they like and\n\n79\n00:04:19.807 --> 00:04:21.880\nthey stick with it for a long time.\n\n80\n00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.740\nSo you can see it's a good thing\nthat they do provide some of\n\n81\n00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.380\nthat legacy compatibility for\npeople that have invested,\n\n82\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.900\nhave invested their information and\ntheir money if you will.\n\n83\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.940\nI guess time is money, information is\nmoney, into some of those earlier formats.\n\n84\n00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nif we just look at this real quick.\n\n85\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.380\nI don't wanna go over all these details,\nthere's a lot here but\n\n86\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.490\nI think this is a great way to kinda\nsee the difference between them\n\n87\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.730\nas well as knowing what's\navailable in certain states.\n\n88\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.733\nYou can see here for\nVHD online versus offline,\n\n89\n00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:53.947\nreally there's not a whole lot of\nflexibility here with that VHD.\n\n90\n00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:57.727\nIn the online mode you'd have to almost\nkind of treat it as if it were a real hard\n\n91\n00:04:57.727 --> 00:05:00.229\ndrive where you're powering\nit down to go ahead and\n\n92\n00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.330\nmake a lot of those changes here.\n\n93\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.320\nAnd conversely,\nif we take a look at VHDX editions or\n\n94\n00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.300\nfile extensions, with that variation,\nwe do see a lot more capability here,\n\n95\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.570\nnot with everything but\nwith certain configurations there.\n\n96\n00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.920\nSo I don't know if you guys\nwanna screenshot that.\n\n97\n00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.900\nJust kind of be familiar with it and\nknow of some of those limitations and\n\n98\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.070\nwe'll continue taking a look\nat different types of drives.\n\n99\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.350\nBut I think we could also create a virtual\nmachine here in our lab environment\n\n100\n00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.340\nthat we can play with.\n\n101\n00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.800\nSo we can just really look at the\ndifferent types of options that we have.\n\n102\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.560\nSo that's what I'm gonna do right now.\n\n103\n00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.024\nI'm gonna go ahead and create a new\nvirtual machine here, so let's see.\n\n104\n00:05:42.024 --> 00:05:45.175\nI'll just go ahead and get that started,\n\n105\n00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:49.780\nwe'll name this plabconfigvn,\nif I spell that correctly.\n\n106\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.315\nLooks right [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:57.048\nAll right, let's just keep this one as the\ngenuine and we will change that start up\n\n108\n00:05:57.048 --> 00:06:02.040\nmemory to something a bit more manageable\nand change that to our private network.\n\n109\n00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.140\nDon't worry, we're going to talk\nabout networking here in Hyper-V\n\n110\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.630\nin a little bit.\n\n111\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.484\nAnd also, keep all the defaults here?\n\n112\n00:06:09.484 --> 00:06:11.101\nYou know what?\n\n113\n00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:13.365\nLet me go back, I do wanna show you this.\n\n114\n00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:13.945\nLet me zoom in.\n\n115\n00:06:17.537 --> 00:06:21.340\nSome of the options that we have here\nsince we are talking about virtual disks.\n\n116\n00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.300\nI know we've already talked about\nhow to create a virtual machine,\n\n117\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.210\nthat's why I'm kinda going fast through\nit, but it's nice to be able to see this.\n\n118\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.552\nRight now, I'm actually creating\na disk with the generation\n\n119\n00:06:32.552 --> 00:06:37.280\nwell with the creation\nof this virtual machine.\n\n120\n00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.140\nHowever, I do have other\noptions here as well.\n\n121\n00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.090\nSo, if I had already had created a VHD or\nVHDX, I could at this point\n\n122\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.310\nin time select this radio button and then\npoint to the location of that file there.\n\n123\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.750\nAlternatively, you could also say,\nhey let's go ahead and\n\n124\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.260\ncreate a virtual machine without a hard\ndisk drive and then attach it later.\n\n125\n00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.923\nBut right now, we're just gonna\ngo ahead and create one and\n\n126\n00:06:58.923 --> 00:07:00.156\ncreate a blank disk there.\n\n127\n00:07:00.156 --> 00:07:02.076\nAll right, you also have, again,\n\n128\n00:07:02.076 --> 00:07:04.770\nthe option to install\nan operating system later.\n\n129\n00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.630\nI have one sitting there on the E drive,\nso we'll just go ahead and use that.\n\n130\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.130\nYou do have an option here to go ahead and\ninstall from a beautiful floppy\n\n131\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.041\nif you choose to do so\nas well as a network based installation.\n\n132\n00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:18.400\nI'll hit Next.\n\n133\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.048\nAnd Finish.\n\n134\n00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:24.532\nNow I do wanna show you inside of\nthis machine once that was created,\n\n135\n00:07:24.532 --> 00:07:28.477\nI'll show you that drive that\nwe had just generated there.\n\n136\n00:07:28.477 --> 00:07:30.694\nLet's pull up File Explorer here.\n\n137\n00:07:33.005 --> 00:07:38.049\nDrawn down to my D drive that's\nwhere that was navigating to,\n\n138\n00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:40.185\ninto our VHD file folder.\n\n139\n00:07:40.185 --> 00:07:46.705\nAnd here you see that plabconfigvm.vhx,\nand that's the actual hard drive,\n\n140\n00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:52.360\nthe VHDX file that was created when\nwe just generated that machine.\n\n141\n00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.668\nSo that's pretty cool there.\n\n142\n00:07:54.668 --> 00:07:58.347\nAnd we'll be kind of hopping back and\nforth in there.\n\n143\n00:07:58.347 --> 00:08:01.385\nPast couple of episodes,\nwe've been diving into Hyper V,\n\n144\n00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:05.030\ntalking about the hypervisors and\nthe virtual machines, right?\n\n145\n00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.201\nWell, one of the things that we didn't\ntalk about is those virtual machines,\n\n146\n00:08:08.201 --> 00:08:09.461\nwhen you create them, right?\n\n147\n00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:12.560\nIt's a logical instance of a machine but\nwhere does it store data, right?\n\n148\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.640\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode.\n\n149\n00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.210\nWe're gonna be talking a little about\nhow to create and configure VM storage.\n\n150\n00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.480\nSo Cherokee,\nwhere do we start with that topic?\n\n151\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Wes.\n\n152\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:26.640\nWith virtualization here we really see\nin Hyper V, two specific types of files.\n\n153\n00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.730\nSo we're actually working with\nfiles that are essentially our hard\n\n154\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.070\ndrives here because we don't have physical\nhard drives in our virtual machines.\n\n155\n00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.640\nOur host is harboring that physical drive,\ncreating a file and\n\n156\n00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.990\nthat's how we access that information.\n\n157\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.460\nIn different virtualization solutions,\nyou have different file extensions.\n\n158\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.290\nHere within Hyper V, we have VHD and VHDX.\n\n159\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.390\nSo VHD is going to be\nthe older of the two.\n\n160\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.560\nYou'll see some limitations there,\nmost notably being storage.\n\n161\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.113\nWhen I think a virtual PC\nhad come into the game and\n\n162\n00:09:01.113 --> 00:09:04.417\nMicrosoft had acquired that organization.\n\n163\n00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:07.810\nThey really adopted that VHD file.\n\n164\n00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.450\nBut you have that 2TB\nlimit whereas with a newer\n\n165\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.150\nVHDX file extension,\nyou have a 64TB limit.\n\n166\n00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.785\nSo that's gonna be a huge difference when\nyou're looking at comparison in sizes.\n\n167\n00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:23.275\nBut let's take a look at my screen and\n\n168\n00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:25.670\nwe'll talk about some of\nthe differences as well.\n\n169\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.276\nSo with our VHD files those\nare going to have a little bit\n\n170\n00:09:30.276 --> 00:09:34.800\nless of the ability to handle\nany kind of corruption.\n\n171\n00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.430\nWith those types of files, especially\nwhen we're talking in kind of power loss.\n\n172\n00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.510\nVHDX also handle those better.\n\n173\n00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:48.490\nVHDX files also are able to really\nhandle larger sectored disks as well.\n\n174\n00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:53.950\nAnd we're talking about also dynamically\nexpanding disks and being able to just\n\n175\n00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.610\nhandle those differencing disks\nin a better capacity as well.\n\n176\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.690\nThere are some limitations though.\n\n177\n00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.700\nVHDX is going to supported\nin only Gentoo machines, so\n\n178\n00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.546\nthat something that we do\nhave to think about there.\n\n179\n00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:14.730\nThere is an conversion allowed\nbetween VHD to VHDX and vice versa.\n\n180\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.572\nBut you can't fool the operating system\ninto thinking, okay, if I had an original\n\n181\n00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:24.990\nVHD file converted to VHDX,\nit's still not gonna work well.\n\n182\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.940\nNot in a VM Gentoo machine.\n\n183\n00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.170\n&gt;&gt; And it sounds like they're trying to\nbring that into alignment with a lot of\n\n184\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.680\nthe newer technologies that we see.\n\n185\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.420\nYou mentioned VHDX only being a part\nof Gentoo in an earlier episode.\n\n186\n00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.370\nYou told us that the Gentoo is\nwhere you could take advantages of.\n\n187\n00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.010\nThings like UEFI and\nits secure boot, right?\n\n188\n00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.541\nAnd one of those are all\nindustry wide standards now and\n\n189\n00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:48.476\nyou talk about the larger drive capacity,\n64TB, right?\n\n190\n00:10:48.476 --> 00:10:51.620\nYou might say, my gosh,\nthat's a lot of information, 64TB.\n\n191\n00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.050\nWell, it's kinda interesting\nthat you say that.\n\n192\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.150\nI was just reading a news article and\n\n193\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.740\ntoday, in fact, as of,\nwhat is today's date.\n\n194\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.400\nWe're in October of 2017 anyhow and\n\n195\n00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.370\nSeagate just came out with\na drive that's 12TB in size.\n\n196\n00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.030\nOne drive.\n\n197\n00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.100\nSo, you can see that these drives\nare getting larger and larger.\n\n198\n00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.890\nSo, it's definitely a good\nthing that they've taken and\n\n199\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.470\nthey've expanded it beyond some of\nthe limitations we've seen with the VHD in\n\n200\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.800\nthe earlier 2TB limitation that they have.\n\n201\n00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.429\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd you know also we're talking\n\n202\n00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:20.666\nabout Cloud storage too\nwith virtualization here.\n\n203\n00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:25.608\nAnd I think the main reason why they\nwanted to ensure that capability,\n\n204\n00:11:25.608 --> 00:11:29.294\nsome of the Azure services\nstill require VHD files,\n\n205\n00:11:29.294 --> 00:11:32.170\nwhich I see that changing in the future.\n\n206\n00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.110\nBut for now, I think that's another reason\nwhy that compatibility exists as well.\n\n207\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.019\n&gt;&gt; And most definitely cuz you have people\nout there that are still running XP.\n\n208\n00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:42.269\nYou know who you are out\nthere right [LAUGH].\n\n209\n00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:44.727\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And XP came out in 2000 what 2001.\n\n210\n00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:47.853\nSo it's been around for a very long time.\n\n211\n00:11:47.853 --> 00:11:51.768\nAnd they like what they like and I stick\nwith it for a long time, so you can see\n\n212\n00:11:51.768 --> 00:11:55.871\nit is a good thing that they do provide\nsome of that legacy and compatibility for\n\n213\n00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:59.620\npeople who have invested their\ninformation, their money if you will.\n\n214\n00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.730\nI guess time is money,\ninformation is money.\n\n215\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.660\nInto some of those earlier formats.\n\n216\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.663\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nif we just look at this real quick.\n\n217\n00:12:06.663 --> 00:12:08.950\nI don't wanna go over all these details,\nthere's a lot here.\n\n218\n00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.210\nBut I think this is a great way to\nkinda see the difference between them,\n\n219\n00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.450\nas well as knowing what's\navailable in certain states.\n\n220\n00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.620\nYou can see here for\nVHD Online versus Offline.\n\n221\n00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.920\nReally, there's not a whole lot\nof flexibility here with that VHD\n\n222\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.820\non the online mode.\n\n223\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.572\nYou'd have to almost kind of treated as\nif it were a real hard drive where you're\n\n224\n00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:31.040\npowering it down to go ahead and\nmake a lot of these changes here.\n\n225\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.030\nAnd conversely,\nif we take a look at VHDX editions or\n\n226\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.000\nfile extensions without variation we\ndo see a lot more capability here.\n\n227\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.290\nNot with everything but\nwith certain configurations there.\n\n228\n00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.640\nSo I don't know if you guys\nwant to screenshot that.\n\n229\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.620\nJust kind of be familiar with it and\nknow some of those limitations and\n\n230\n00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.790\nwe'll continue taking a look\nat different types of drives.\n\n231\n00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.080\nBut I think we could also create a virtual\nmachine here in our lab environments\n\n232\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.240\nthat we can play with so\n\n233\n00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.520\nwe can just really look at the different\ntypes of options that we have.\n\n234\n00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.280\nSo that's what I'm gonna do right now.\n\n235\n00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.090\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ncreate a new virtual machine here.\n\n236\n00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:12.920\nSo let's see, I'll just go ahead and\nget that started.\n\n237\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:19.963\nWe'll name this PLABCONFIGVM,\nif I spell that correctly, looks right.\n\n238\n00:13:19.963 --> 00:13:23.522\n[LAUGH] All right,\nlet's just keep this one as gen one and\n\n239\n00:13:23.522 --> 00:13:28.144\nwe will change that start up memory to\nsomething a bit more manageable and\n\n240\n00:13:28.144 --> 00:13:30.760\nchange that to our private networks.\n\n241\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.816\nDon't worry,\nwe're gonna talk about networking here in\n\n242\n00:13:34.816 --> 00:13:39.502\nHyper V here in a little bit and\nalso keep all the defaults here.\n\n243\n00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:41.410\nYou know what, let me go back.\n\n244\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.160\nI do want to show you this.\n\n245\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.390\nLet me zoom in and remove this.\n\n246\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.742\nSome of the options that we have here,\nsince we are talking about virtual disks,\n\n247\n00:13:49.742 --> 00:13:52.275\nI know we've already talked about\nhow to create a virtual machine,\n\n248\n00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:54.064\nthat's why I'm kind of\ngoing fast through it.\n\n249\n00:13:54.064 --> 00:13:56.910\nBut it's nice to be able to see this.\n\n250\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:01.910\nRight now, I'm actually creating\na disk with the generation,\n\n251\n00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.902\nwell, with the creation\nof this virtual machine.\n\n252\n00:14:05.902 --> 00:14:08.860\nHowever, I do have other\noptions here as well.\n\n253\n00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.810\nSo, if I had already had created a VHD or\na VHDX, I could at this point\n\n254\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:19.030\nin time select this radio button and then\npoint to the location of that file there.\n\n255\n00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.430\nAlternatively, you can also say,\nhey lets go ahead and\n\n256\n00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.980\ncreate a virtual machine without a hard\ndisk drive and then attach it later.\n\n257\n00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.780\nBut right now,\nwe're just gonna go ahead and create one,\n\n258\n00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.310\nand create a blank disk there, all right?\n\n259\n00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.500\nYou also have, again, the option to\ninstall an operating system later.\n\n260\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.420\nI have one sitting there on the E drive,\nso we'll just go ahead and use that.\n\n261\n00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.900\nYou do have an option here to go ahead and\ninstall from a beautiful floppy,\n\n262\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.140\nif you choose to do so.\n\n263\n00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.950\nAs well as a network based installation.\n\n264\n00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.070\nWe'll hit Next and Finish.\n\n265\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.356\nNow I do wanna show you\ninside of this machine,\n\n266\n00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:58.226\nonce that was created I'll show you that\ndrive that we had just generated there.\n\n267\n00:14:58.226 --> 00:15:01.876\nLet me just pull the file explorer here.\n\n268\n00:15:01.876 --> 00:15:06.371\nDrawn down to my D drive that's where that\n\n269\n00:15:06.371 --> 00:15:11.252\nwas navigating to into\nour VHD file folder and\n\n270\n00:15:11.252 --> 00:15:15.510\nhere you see that PLABCONFIGVM.vhx.\n\n271\n00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.850\nAnd that's the actual hard drive,\n\n272\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.590\nthe VHDX file that was created when\nwe just generated that machine.\n\n273\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.630\nSo that's pretty cool there.\n\n274\n00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.960\nAll right and we'll be kind of like\nhopping back and forth in there.\n\n275\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.540\nAnd showing you,\nsorry to keep resetting here, my\n\n276\n00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:37.160\nscreen sizing and\nour virtual layers here is key.\n\n277\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.420\nLet's talk about different\ntypes of drives real quick.\n\n278\n00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.350\nThere are three that I'd\nlike to talk about here,\n\n279\n00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.390\nthe first one being fixed drives.\n\n280\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.660\nSo fixed drives are going to\nbe pretty straight forward.\n\n281\n00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.601\nThey are what they appear to be.\n\n282\n00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:53.121\nSo whenever I create a fixed drive,\n\n283\n00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:56.430\nI'm actually reserving a contiguous\namount of space on that physical hard.\n\n284\n00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.602\nPast couple of episodes,\nwe've been diving into Hyper-V,\n\n285\n00:15:59.602 --> 00:16:03.240\ntalking about the hypervisors and\nthe virtual machines, right?\n\n286\n00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.940\nWell, one of the things that\nwe didn't talk about is, well,\n\n287\n00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.800\nthose virtual machines when\nyou create them, right?\n\n288\n00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.770\nIt's a logical instance of a machine,\nbut where does it store data, right?\n\n289\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.710\nSo, that's what we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode,\n\n290\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.830\nwe're gonna be talking a little bit about\nhow to create and configure VM storage.\n\n291\n00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.690\nCherokee, where do we\nstart with that topic?\n\n292\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:19.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well Wes,\n\n293\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.850\nwith virtualization here we really see\nin Hyper-V two specific types of files,\n\n294\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:30.580\nso we're actually working with files that\nare, essentially, our hard drives here.\n\n295\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.280\nBecause we don't have physical hard\ndrives in our virtual machines,\n\n296\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.850\nour host is harboring that physical drive,\ncreating a file, and\n\n297\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.200\nthat's how we access that information.\n\n298\n00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.508\nIn different virtualization solutions\nyou have different file extensions.\n\n299\n00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:47.360\nHere within Hyper-V, we have VHD and\n\n300\n00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.600\nVHDX, so\nVHD is going to be the older of the two.\n\n301\n00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.670\nYou'll see some limitations there,\nmost notably being storage when, I think,\n\n302\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:02.080\na virtual PC came into the game and\nMicrosoft has acquired that organization.\n\n303\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:08.110\nThey really adopted that VHD file,\nbut you had that 2 terabyte limit,\n\n304\n00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:15.360\nwhereas with a newer VHDX file extension,\nyou have a 65 terabyte limit.\n\n305\n00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:20.230\nSo that's gonna be a huge difference when\nyou're looking at comparison in sizes But\n\n306\n00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.350\nlet's take a look at my screen,\n\n307\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.880\nwe'll talk about some of\nthe other differences as well.\n\n308\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.750\nSo, with our VHD files,\nthose are going to have a little bit\n\n309\n00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.720\nless of the ability to handle\nany kind of corruption.\n\n310\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.320\nWith those types of files,\n\n311\n00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.720\nespecially when we're talking in a kind of\npower loss VHDX also handle those better.\n\n312\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:46.700\nVHDX files also are able to really\nhandle larger sectored disks as well,\n\n313\n00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:52.160\nand we're talking about also dynamically\nexpanding disks, and being able to just\n\n314\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.820\nHandle those differencing disks\nin a better capacity as well.\n\n315\n00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:03.640\nThere are some limitations though, VHD is\ngoing to be supported in only machines.\n\n316\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.600\nSo that something that we do\nhave to think about their.\n\n317\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.940\nThere is a conversion allowed\nbetween VHD to VHDX and vice versa.\n\n318\n00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.400\nBut you can't fool the operating\nsystem into thinking okay,\n\n319\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.270\nif I had an original [INAUDIBLE] file,\nconvert it to VHDX,\n\n320\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.150\nit's still not going to work\nwell in the Gen 2 machine.\n\n321\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.380\n&gt;&gt; And it sounds like they're trying to\nbring that into alignment with a lot of\n\n322\n00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.890\nthe newer technologies that we see.\n\n323\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.760\nYou mentioned VHDX only being a part\nof Gen 10 in an earlier episode, and\n\n324\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.580\nyou told us that the Gen 2 is\nwhere you can take advantages of\n\n325\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.220\nThings like UEFI in\nit's secure boot right?\n\n326\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.750\nAnd while all those are industry\nwide standards now and\n\n327\n00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.960\nyou talk about the larger drive capacity,\n64 terabytes, right?\n\n328\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.210\nYou might say, my gosh that's a lot\nof information, 64 terabytes.\n\n329\n00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.260\nWell it's kind of interesting\nthat you say that.\n\n330\n00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.950\nI was just reading a news article, and\ntoday in fact as of, what is today's date?\n\n331\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.400\nWe're in October of 2017 anyhow.\n\n332\n00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.240\nAnd Seagate just came out with a drive\nthat's 12TB in size, one drive.\n\n333\n00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.860\nSo you can see that these drives\nare getting larger and larger so\n\n334\n00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.690\nit's definitely a good thing that they've\ntaken and they've expanded it beyond some\n\n335\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:15.010\nof the limitations we see with the VHD and\nthe earlier 2TB limitation that they have.\n\n336\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.580\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nyou know also we're talking about\n\n337\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.610\n&gt;&gt; Cloud storage too with\n\n338\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.110\nvirtualization here.\n\n339\n00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.840\nAnd I think the main reason why they\nwanted to ensure that capability is some\n\n340\n00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:30.380\nof the Azure services require VHD files\nwhich I see them changing in the future\n\n341\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.320\nbut for now I think that's another reason\nwhy that compatibility exists as well.\n\n342\n00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.290\n&gt;&gt; And most definitely,\n\n343\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.618\ncuz [LAUGH] you have people out\nthere that are still running XP.\n\n344\n00:19:37.618 --> 00:19:40.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know who you are out there, right?\n\n345\n00:19:40.204 --> 00:19:41.890\n[LAUGH] And XP came out in what, 2001.\n\n346\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.680\nSo it's been around for\na very long time, and\n\n347\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.810\npeople, they They like what they like and\nthey stick with it or a long time.\n\n348\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.330\nSo you can see it's a good thing that\nthey do provide some of that legacy\n\n349\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.320\ncompatibility for\npeople that had invested, right?\n\n350\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.830\nHave invested their information and\ntheir money if you will.\n\n351\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.940\nI guess time is money,\ninformation is money.\n\n352\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.602\nin some of those earlier formats.\n\n353\n00:20:02.602 --> 00:20:04.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nif we just look at this real quick.\n\n354\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.360\nI don't want to go over\nall of these details.\n\n355\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.480\nThere is a lot here, but I think this is\na great way to kind of see the difference\n\n356\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.660\nbetween them as well as knowing\nwhat's available in different states.\n\n357\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.180\nYou can see here for\nVHD online verses offline, really\n\n358\n00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.030\nthere is not a whole lot of flexibility\nhere with that VHD and the online load.\n\n359\n00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.580\nYou'd almost have to kind of Treated\nas if it were a real hard drive,\n\n360\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.010\nwhere you're powering it down to go ahead\nand make a lot of those changes here, and\n\n361\n00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.240\nconversely, if take a look\nat VHDX editions, or\n\n362\n00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.210\nfile extensions with that variation\nwe do see a lot more capability here.\n\n363\n00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:42.500\nNot with everything, but\nwith certain configurations there.\n\n364\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.850\nSo I don't know if you guys\nwanna screenshot that.\n\n365\n00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.830\nJust kind of be familiar with it and\nknow some of those limitations and\n\n366\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:53.030\nwe'll continue taking a look at different\ntypes of drives but I think we could also\n\n367\n00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.450\ncreate a virtual machine here in our lab\nenvironment that we can play with so\n\n368\n00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.810\nwe can just really look at the different\ntypes of options that we have so\n\n369\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.490\nthat's what I'm gonna do right now.\n\n370\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:09.380\nI'm gonna go ahead and create a new\nvirtual machine here so let's see.\n\n371\n00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.160\nI'll just go ahead and get that started.\n\n372\n00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:17.535\nOnly in this plabconfig VM,\nif I've spelled that correctly, sorry.\n\n373\n00:21:17.535 --> 00:21:21.680\n[LAUGH]\nAll right, let's just keep this one at\n\n374\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.910\na gen1, and we will change that startup\nmemory to something a bit more manageable.\n\n375\n00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.970\nAnd change that to a private network.\n\n376\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.060\nDon't worry we're going to talk\nabout networking here in Hyper-V\n\n377\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.470\nin a little bit.\n\n378\n00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.090\nAnd also, I keep all of the defaults here.\n\n379\n00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.990\nYou know what?\n\n380\n00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.370\nLet me go back,\nI do want to show you this.\n\n381\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:45.310\nLet me zoom in, like this some of\n\n382\n00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.270\nthe options which we have here because I\nknow we are talking about virtual discs.\n\n383\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.555\nI know we've already talked about\nhow to create a virtual machine,\n\n384\n00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:55.120\nthat's why I'm kinda going fast through\nit, but it's nice to be able to see this.\n\n385\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.180\nRight now, I am actually creating\ndisc with a generation, of,\n\n386\n00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.210\nwell, with the creation\nof this virtual machine.\n\n387\n00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.170\nHowever, I do have other\noptions here as well.\n\n388\n00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:12.140\nIf I had already had created a VHD or\nVHDX, I could at this point in time select\n\n389\n00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:16.740\nthis radio button, and then point\nto the location of that file there.\n\n390\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.449\nAlternatively, you could also say,\nhey, let's go ahead and\n\n391\n00:22:19.449 --> 00:22:22.837\ncreate a virtual machine without a hard\ndisk drive, and then attach it later.\n\n392\n00:22:22.837 --> 00:22:25.424\nBut right now, we’re just gonna\ngo ahead and create one and\n\n393\n00:22:25.424 --> 00:22:26.630\ncreate a blank disk there.\n\n394\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.710\nAll right, you also have again the option\nto install an operating system later.\n\n395\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.630\nI have one sitting there on the E drive,\nso we’ll just go ahead and use that.\n\n396\n00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:40.230\nYou do have an option here to go ahead and\ninstall from a bootable floppy if\n\n397\n00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.280\nyou choose to do so\nas well as a network-based installation.\n\n398\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.320\nI’ll hit Next nd Finish.\n\n399\n00:22:48.295 --> 00:22:50.980\nNow I do want to show you\ninside of this machine,\n\n400\n00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.560\nonce that was created I'll show you that\ndrive that we had just generated there.\n\n401\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.740\nLet me File Explorer here.\n\n402\n00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.040\nDraw on down to my D drive,\nthat's where that was navigating to.\n\n403\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.836\nInto our VHD file folder.\n\n404\n00:23:06.836 --> 00:23:10.258\nHere you see that PLABCONFIGVM.vhx and\n\n405\n00:23:10.258 --> 00:23:15.490\nthat's the actual hard drive\nthe VHDX file that was created,\n\n406\n00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:21.840\nwhen we just generated that machine So\nit's pretty cool there.\n\n407\n00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.850\nAll right I will be kind of hopping\nback and forth in there And showing you.\n\n408\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.530\nSorry to keep resetting here.\n\n409\n00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:35.370\nMy screen size in our\nvirtual layers here is key.\n\n410\n00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.630\nLet's talk about different\ntypes of drives real quick.\n\n411\n00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.560\nThere are three that I'd\nlike to talk about here.\n\n412\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.600\nThe first one being fixed drives.\n\n413\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.330\nSo fixed drives are going to be.\n\n414\n00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.870\nPretty straightforward.\n\n415\n00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.787\nThey are what they appear to be.\n\n416\n00:23:49.787 --> 00:23:54.000\nSo whenever I create a fixed drive, I'm\nactually reserving a contiguous amount of\n\n417\n00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.289\nspace on that physical hard disk, the\ndrive, and it doesn't change or fluctuate.\n\n418\n00:23:58.289 --> 00:24:02.636\nYou do see a good Last couple of episodes\nwe've been diving in to Hyper V,\n\n419\n00:24:02.636 --> 00:24:06.870\ntalking about the hypervisors and\nthe virtual machines, right?\n\n420\n00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.070\nWell, one of the things that we didn't\ntalk about is those virtual machines\n\n421\n00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.378\nwhen you create them, right?\n\n422\n00:24:11.378 --> 00:24:14.400\nIt's a logical instance of a machine but\nwhere does it store data, right?\n\n423\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.410\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntalk about in this episode.\n\n424\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.055\nWe're gonna be talking a little bit\nhow create, configure VM storage.\n\n425\n00:24:20.055 --> 00:24:22.320\nSo Cherokee,\nwhere do we start with that topic?\n\n426\n00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay well, Wes,\n\n427\n00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:28.380\nwith virtualization here we really see\nin Hyper V two specific types of files.\n\n428\n00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.205\nSo we're actually working with files that\nare essentially are hard drives here\n\n429\n00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:37.465\nbecause we don't have physical hard\ndrives in our virtual machines.\n\n430\n00:24:37.465 --> 00:24:40.845\nOur host is harboring that physical drive,\ncreating a file and\n\n431\n00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:43.830\nthat's how we access that information.\n\n432\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:48.300\nIn different virtualization solutions\nyou have different file extensions.\n\n433\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.092\nHere within HyperV, we have VHD and VHDX.\n\n434\n00:24:52.092 --> 00:24:54.594\nSo VHD is going to be\nthe older of the two,\n\n435\n00:24:54.594 --> 00:24:59.360\nyou'll see some limitations there,\nmost notably being storage.\n\n436\n00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.146\nWhen I think a virtual PC came\ninto the game and Microsoft had\n\n437\n00:25:04.146 --> 00:25:09.521\nacquired that organization,\nthey really adopted that VHD file.\n\n438\n00:25:09.521 --> 00:25:14.140\nBut you had that 2TB limit,\nwhereas with a newer\n\n439\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.990\nVHDX file extension,\nyou have the 64TB limit.\n\n440\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.421\nSo that's gonna be a huge difference when\nyou're looking at comparison and sizes.\n\n441\n00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:24.990\nBut let's take a look at my screen.\n\n442\n00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.510\nWe'll talk about some of\nthe other differences as well.\n\n443\n00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:32.501\nSo, with our VHD files, those\nare going to have a little bit less of\n\n444\n00:25:32.501 --> 00:25:37.870\nthe ability to handle any kind of\ncorruption with those types of files.\n\n445\n00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:43.435\nEspecially when we're talking any kind of\npower loss, VHDX also handle those better.\n\n446\n00:25:43.435 --> 00:25:48.560\nVHDX files also are able to really\nhandle larger sectored disks,\n\n447\n00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.787\nas well and I'm talking about\nalso dynamically expanding disks.\n\n448\n00:25:53.787 --> 00:25:57.535\nAnd being able to just handle\nthose differencing disks\n\n449\n00:25:57.535 --> 00:26:00.450\nin a better capacity as well.\n\n450\n00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.530\nThere are some limitations though.\n\n451\n00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:07.280\nVHDX is going to be supported\nin only gen two machines.\n\n452\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.230\nSo that's something that we\ndo have to think about there.\n\n453\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:16.570\nThere is a conversion allowed\nbetween VHD to VHDX and vice versa.\n\n454\n00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:21.400\nBut you can't fool the operating system\ninto thinking, okay, if I had an original\n\n455\n00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:28.780\nVHD file converted to VHDX, it's still not\ngonna work well in the VM gen two machine.\n\n456\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.010\n&gt;&gt; And it sounds like they're trying to\nbring that into alignment with a lot of\n\n457\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.500\nthe newer technologies that we see.\n\n458\n00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.226\nYou mentioned VHDX only being a part\nof gen two in an earlier episode.\n\n459\n00:26:37.226 --> 00:26:40.210\nYou told us that the gen two is\nwhere you can take advantages of.\n\n460\n00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.860\nThings like UEFI and\nits secure boot, right?\n\n461\n00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.040\nAnd a lot of those are all\nindustry wide standards.\n\n462\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.448\nNow when you talk about the larger\ndrive capacity, 64TB, right?\n\n463\n00:26:49.448 --> 00:26:53.460\nYou might say,\nmy gosh that's a lot of information, 64TB.\n\n464\n00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.900\nWell, it's kinda interesting\nthat you say that.\n\n465\n00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.870\nI was just reading a news article and\ntoday, in fact,\n\n466\n00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.620\nas of what is today's date?\n\n467\n00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.330\nWe're in October of 2017,\n\n468\n00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:06.840\nanyhow and Seagate just came out with\na drive that's 12TB in size, one drive.\n\n469\n00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.940\nSo you can see that these drives\nare getting larger and larger.\n\n470\n00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.730\nSo it's definitely a good\nthing that they've taken and\n\n471\n00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.330\nthey've expanded it beyond some of\nthe limitations we see with the VHD in\n\n472\n00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.586\nthe earlier 2 terabyte\nlimitation that they have.\n\n473\n00:27:18.586 --> 00:27:21.240\n&gt;&gt; Right and you know also we're\ntalking about Cloud storage too with\n\n474\n00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.600\nvirtualization here.\n\n475\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.530\nAnd I think the main reason why they\nwanted to ensure that capability, some of\n\n476\n00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:34.010\nthe Azure services still require VHD files\nwhich I see that changing in the future.\n\n477\n00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:37.950\nBut for now, I think that's another reason\nwhy that compatibility exists as well.\n\n478\n00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.600\n&gt;&gt; And most definitely cuz you have people\nout there that are still running XP.\n\n479\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.052\nYou know who you are out there, right?\n\n480\n00:27:43.052 --> 00:27:44.043\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n481\n00:27:44.043 --> 00:27:46.501\n&gt;&gt; And XP came out in 2000 what 2001.\n\n482\n00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:50.558\nSo it's been around for a very long time\nand people, they like what they like and\n\n483\n00:27:50.558 --> 00:27:52.325\nthey stick with it for a long time.\n\n484\n00:27:52.325 --> 00:27:54.690\nSo you can see it's a good\nthing that do provide.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.310\nHello to our viewers out there.\n\n4\n00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.881\nWelcome back to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.307\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n6\n00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:21.167\nin today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series of 7410.\n\n7\n00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:24.964\nThat's right, the MCSA in Windows Server\n2012 and joining back in the studios for\n\n8\n00:00:24.964 --> 00:00:27.590\nthis very endeavor is none other than Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.570\nCherokee, how you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, how's it going Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.010\n&gt;&gt; Man its going great, in a couple\nof episodes that we've talked about.\n\n12\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.110\nWe talked about all different kinds\nof pieces of the virtualization.\n\n13\n00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.440\nWe talked about Hyper-V, we've talked\nabout the role itself, virtual machines.\n\n14\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.972\nWe even got to see you create a virtual\nmachine and create some VHD storage, but\n\n15\n00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:48.006\nyou did that through\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n16\n00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.280\nSo I think in this one we're\ngonna go open the hood.\n\n17\n00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.959\n&gt;&gt; We've graduated.\n\n18\n00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:53.261\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n19\n00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.619\nwe're gonna get into the command\nline interface, right?\n\n20\n00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.106\nWe're gonna work with PowerShell.\n\n21\n00:00:57.106 --> 00:00:58.768\n&gt;&gt; So can you help us out with it?\n\n22\n00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:00.514\n&gt;&gt; I sure can and you know what Wes,\n\n23\n00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:04.010\nanother thing that can help\nyou as well is the Internet.\n\n24\n00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.315\nSo Microsoft is really great at\ndocumenting a lot of their cmdlets here,\n\n25\n00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:09.971\nbecause they want you to be\nfamiliar with their product and\n\n26\n00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:11.475\ntake advantage of it and use it.\n\n27\n00:01:11.475 --> 00:01:14.930\nSo let's take a look at my screen,\nI've included this link in the notes.\n\n28\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.860\nThis is just one particular cmdlet that I\nwanna start with today to show you how to\n\n29\n00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.980\ncreate a new virtual hard disk or\nvirtual VHDX as well,\n\n30\n00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.450\nbut as you can see on\nthe left hand side here.\n\n31\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.810\nWe've got quite an extensive\nlist of those cmdlets.\n\n32\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.107\nWell we've spoke about those before\njust know that there is help here with\n\n33\n00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:38.819\nthe syntax and I just wanted to remind you\nof that before we get started and show you\n\n34\n00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.814\nthe different parameters that you could\nreally specify specific configurations for\n\n35\n00:01:43.814 --> 00:01:44.669\nthese disks.\n\n36\n00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:48.801\nAnd we'll take a look at some of those\nparameters right here in this episode,\n\n37\n00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:49.750\nas well.\n\n38\n00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.581\nSo let me start with PowerShell.\n\n39\n00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:58.045\nLet me just kind of move things around\na little bit, there we go, okay, so\n\n40\n00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:02.941\nin the last episode or the previous show,\nwe did take a look at being able to create\n\n41\n00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:07.950\nfixed drives, dynamically expanding\ndrives, and different sync drives.\n\n42\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.930\nAnd of course, we can do that all\nwithin this interface as well, so\n\n43\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.140\nlet's go ahead and create a drive.\n\n44\n00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.140\nThe first drive that I wanna create\nhere is going to be a fixed drive, so\n\n45\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.930\nif we use that New-VHD cmdlet And\nit's kinda funny because they really,\n\n46\n00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.410\nthey just use the term VHD and it doesn't\nmean, you're only creating a VHD.\n\n47\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.139\nYou can specify VHDX with that as well.\n\n48\n00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.143\nThat's just how they go ahead and\nuse that term, and\n\n49\n00:02:33.143 --> 00:02:39.340\nwe do need to specify the path just like\nwe would in the graphical user interface.\n\n50\n00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.270\nSo that hasn't changed, so\n\n51\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.390\nremember that was going to be in\nour D drive under my VHD folder.\n\n52\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.303\nSo this is where I can set\nif I wanna use a .vhd or\n\n53\n00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:53.240\n.vhdx extension just by\nsimply naming it that.\n\n54\n00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.513\nSo for this first machine I'm gonna use\nan abbreviation PSH for PowerShell, so\n\n55\n00:02:57.513 --> 00:03:01.913\nthat I can remember what I'm doing here\nbecause we're gonna create a lot of drives\n\n56\n00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:02.700\nin this show.\n\n57\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.540\nSo let's create through PowerShell a fixed\ndrive, and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n58\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.215\nmake this drive a VHD file.\n\n59\n00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:11.483\nS we'll go ahead and leave that,\n\n60\n00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:15.857\nwe do need ot add the dash fixed\nparameter here, to make sure that\n\n61\n00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:20.314\nthe operating system knows we want\nto have this drive to be fixed.\n\n62\n00:03:20.314 --> 00:03:24.915\nWe also need to add a size here, in bytes,\nso let's go ahead and do that as well,\n\n63\n00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:29.270\nlet's just make this one 10 gigs, so\nI'm not running out of space here.\n\n64\n00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.320\nI'm not sure how much I have\non this lab environment, but\n\n65\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.368\nI think we'll be all right.\n\n66\n00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.260\nWe're gonna go ahead and create that disk,\nit doesn't take too long here.\n\n67\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.370\nRemember, when you do create those disks,\nif you are creating a larger,\n\n68\n00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.790\nours is only 10 gigs here, but\n\n69\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.390\nif you had created a larger one,\nit would take more time to go ahead and\n\n70\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.830\ncreate that according to the amount of\nspace that you are allocating there.\n\n71\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.790\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n72\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.815\nThis one shouldn't take too long,\nI say that and\n\n73\n00:03:56.815 --> 00:04:00.529\nthen we're like [SOUND]\n[LAUGH] almost there guys.\n\n74\n00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:05.529\n[COUGH] But it really wasn't difficult and\nyou saw hey, look, PowerShell is a great\n\n75\n00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:09.610\nto just go ahead and create those disks,\nhave them ready on the fly.\n\n76\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.056\nYou can see all\nthe information listed here.\n\n77\n00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:14.414\nThe location, the different file sizes and\n\n78\n00:04:14.414 --> 00:04:19.510\nof course there are parameter options that\nwe didn't set that you could set as well.\n\n79\n00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.151\n&gt;&gt; I like this one Cherokee, because in\nsome of the other examples that you've\n\n80\n00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.931\ngiven us when you do something right\nin PowerShell, it's very anti climatic.\n\n81\n00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:28.318\nI mean, it doesn't even show you anything,\nbut when you get it wrong, like I said,\n\n82\n00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:30.991\nit'll paint the whole entire screen red,\nso at least you can see,\n\n83\n00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:32.708\nfirst of all, that it was successful, and\n\n84\n00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:35.992\nthen you can see some of those additional\nparameters that you've talked about.\n\n85\n00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:39.835\nNow, in one of the episodes where\nwe're in the graphical user interface,\n\n86\n00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:40.940\nI kind of made a joke.\n\n87\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.196\nAnd if anybody's seen my typing abilities,\nthey'll realize it's not really a joke,\n\n88\n00:04:45.196 --> 00:04:46.990\nthat maybe I typed something wrong.\n\n89\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.727\nLet's say that I made a VHD file and\nI come back and\n\n90\n00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:55.387\nI've figure out,\nit wasn't supposed to be a VHD file.\n\n91\n00:04:55.387 --> 00:04:58.590\nI left off the X [LAUGH] and\nit's actually supposed to be a VHDX file.\n\n92\n00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.405\nCan we also convert it\nhere in the CLI as well?\n\n93\n00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:04.945\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and\nthat's going to be a huge plus,\n\n94\n00:05:04.945 --> 00:05:06.501\nbecause I'm guilty of that too.\n\n95\n00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:10.620\nHey, women are allowed to change their\nminds, right, so if I wanted VHDX file,\n\n96\n00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.780\nthen let's go ahead and make a VHDX file.\n\n97\n00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.110\nSo let's do that here in PowerShell.\n\n98\n00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.260\nSo what I can use is you\nguys have already seen,\n\n99\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.120\nwe did take a look like Wes said\nin the graphical user interface,\n\n100\n00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.350\nbut we're gonna be using the Convert\ncmdlet here to go ahead and change that.\n\n101\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.220\nSo let's go ahead and type Convert and\nthis is going to be dash VHD.\n\n102\n00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.250\nAgain, regardless whether\nit's really VHD or VHDX,\n\n103\n00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.840\nremember that conversion can\nhappen in both ways here.\n\n104\n00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.190\nSo I just, again,\n\n105\n00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.850\nneed to specify that path,\nthat path is still gonna be in my D drive.\n\n106\n00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.865\nAnd that VHD folder, backslash,\nand the drive, let's just\n\n107\n00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:51.949\nwork with the one that we had there,\nthe PSH for fixed and that was a dot VHD.\n\n108\n00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.709\nNow, when I go ahead and\nspecify my destination path,\n\n109\n00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.830\nthis is where you're actually\nperforming that conversion.\n\n110\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.110\nIf I can spell it correctly,\nDestination Path.\n\n111\n00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.080\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nput this in my D drive again as well and\n\n112\n00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.940\nbecause that's where my\ncurrent file is residing.\n\n113\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.049\nSo if I go ahead and\nspecify my VHD\\, and then PSHFIXED,\n\n114\n00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:22.763\nnow here, I'm just gonna change that\nextension to a VHDX instead of a VHD.\n\n115\n00:06:22.763 --> 00:06:28.440\nAnd this is actually, what you would do\nto go ahead and perform that conversion.\n\n116\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.340\nNow, this is gonna take a few minutes,\nif it takes too long here,\n\n117\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.600\nI won't have you guys suffer through this,\nwe'll do a TV time out.\n\n118\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.140\nSo just be aware of that, of course,\n\n119\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.560\nthe larger your drivers are that\nconversion will take longer as well.\n\n120\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.270\nSo again not too difficult\nit's actually pretty easy.\n\n121\n00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.819\nThey're in PowerShell., so we're at 13%.\n\n122\n00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.664\nI think we'll go ahead and\njust do a quick timeout, so\n\n123\n00:06:49.664 --> 00:06:51.150\nwe can come back with that drive finished.\n\n124\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.020\nOkay, it looks like our disk has been\nconverted from that VHD to a VHDX,\n\n125\n00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.980\nso let's take a look at how we could\ncreate a dynamically expanding disk.\n\n126\n00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.440\nWe're gonna be using that same cmdlet,\nlet me just clear my screen here.\n\n127\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.030\nWe're gonna type in New -VHD again,\nwe'll specify our path.\n\n128\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.103\nSame location, nothing crazy here.\n\n129\n00:07:13.103 --> 00:07:18.249\nThis is going to be VHD location and\nfor the name of this drive, let's just\n\n130\n00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:23.562\ngo ahead and be super creative and\nwe'll name this one PowerShell Dynamic.\n\n131\n00:07:23.562 --> 00:07:28.500\nAnd let's see, this one we'll go ahead and\nspecify as a VHDX.\n\n132\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:37.057\nWe need to specify our size here, invite,\nand again we'll, just do 10 gigs.\n\n133\n00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:40.521\nThis is pretty small, but\nI just want to be safe with my storage,\n\n134\n00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:44.898\nso we'll go ahead and hit enter, and there\nyou can see that information as well.\n\n135\n00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:48.859\nSo just getting familiar with using\nPowerShell is really key here,\n\n136\n00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:50.743\nit's not anything difficult.\n\n137\n00:07:50.743 --> 00:07:55.056\n&gt;&gt; So speaking of being safe with our\nstorage, one of the disk types that you\n\n138\n00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:58.820\ntold us about in a previous\nepisode was the differencing disk.\n\n139\n00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.340\nIs that something that we can also create?\n\n140\n00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.865\nI can only imagine that if we can do\n\n141\n00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:02.872\nthe fixed disk-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n142\n00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:04.585\n&gt;&gt; We can do whether it's the dynamic,\n\n143\n00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:07.250\nwe should be able to do\nthe differencing as well, right?\n\n144\n00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.170\n&gt;&gt; We should, so let's go ahead and\nclear the screen and\n\n145\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.368\nI'll show you how to do that, so.\n\n146\n00:08:11.368 --> 00:08:15.760\nAgain, we're gonna be using that same\nparameter here with our new New- VHD, but\n\n147\n00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.590\nthis time, remember how in the graphical\nuser interface we had to specify that\n\n148\n00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.720\nparent location?\n\n149\n00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.350\nWell, we need to do that here as well.\n\n150\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:27.430\nSo instead of just typing in path,\nthis time we're gonna specify,\n\n151\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:33.590\nwhatever that is, that's not what we wanna\ndo, ParentPath P-A-R-E-N-T, there we go.\n\n152\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.090\nSo here we'll specify that ParentPath and\n\n153\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.680\nthat is going to also be in a D drive,\nbecause we're gonna go ahead and\n\n154\n00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.380\npull for one of the drives\nthat we already created here.\n\n155\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.370\nLet's go ahead and use that PSHFIXED\ndrive that we've had created.\n\n156\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.370\nAnd that one we did change that one to\n.VHDX so let's go ahead and do that.\n\n157\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.453\nAnd we need to specify our new\npath location there, and again,\n\n158\n00:08:58.453 --> 00:09:00.860\nthat'll just be in our D, VHD.\n\n159\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.652\nAnd the name of this drive, let's go\nahead and name this one CHILDDIFF like we\n\n160\n00:09:05.652 --> 00:09:09.927\nhave in the past, just so\nthat we can remember the difference there,\n\n161\n00:09:09.927 --> 00:09:12.950\nall right, so CHILDDIV and\nthen again .VHDX.\n\n162\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.877\nWe do have to keep in mind\nof that extension there,\n\n163\n00:09:15.877 --> 00:09:19.726\nand then we also have to add our\nparameter here for differencing.\n\n164\n00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:26.018\nAnd oops, I have one error here,\n\n165\n00:09:26.018 --> 00:09:30.780\nCHILDDIFF is not recognized\nas a name of a cmdlet there.\n\n166\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.340\nI used the pipe instead of backslashes\nthere, that's what happened,\n\n167\n00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.450\nwith my typing.\n\n168\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.494\nLet me change that real quick,\nand then it should be good to go.\n\n169\n00:09:42.136 --> 00:09:47.792\nLet's see, P S,\n\n170\n00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:55.280\none more typo, all right, let me go back,\nVHDX, so that's okay, this stuff happens.\n\n171\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.186\nAnd what I'm doing here is I'm\nactually reading what this red means,\n\n172\n00:09:59.186 --> 00:10:03.158\nbecause Microsoft in PowerShell most\nof the time they'll tell you what\n\n173\n00:10:03.158 --> 00:10:04.693\nis actually going on here.\n\n174\n00:10:04.693 --> 00:10:06.933\nAnd if you just take a minute\nthere to go ahead and\n\n175\n00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:08.890\nlook at that you can see that h actually.\n\n176\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.460\nI'll just keep it my capitalization\nhere and go ahead and add that in and\n\n177\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.480\nthen run it this time.\n\n178\n00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.849\nAnd so, you can go ahead and\nfix your errors that way because hey,\n\n179\n00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:18.056\nerrors [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n180\n00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:21.870\nit just shows you a real\nworld trouble shooting.\n\n181\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.334\nHey what did I do?\n\n182\n00:10:23.334 --> 00:10:25.250\nI typed it wrong, right?\n\n183\n00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.256\nSo thank goodness for the convert\ncommand as well or commandlet, too.\n\n184\n00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:32.409\nOr not convert, I'm sorry, but\nbeing able to edit them after the fact.\n\n185\n00:10:32.409 --> 00:10:33.150\n&gt;&gt; Edit, for sure.\n\n186\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.821\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, now, in one of\nthe things that you had showed us,\n\n187\n00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:41.327\nwhen you are creating a virtual machine\nis that one of the options was to attach\n\n188\n00:10:41.327 --> 00:10:42.389\nan existing VHD.\n\n189\n00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:47.167\nAnd we've got a road to pass that option,\nbecause you were creating VHDs as went,\n\n190\n00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:48.976\nwe were creating these disks.\n\n191\n00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:49.695\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n192\n00:10:49.695 --> 00:10:53.953\nis that something that you can do be at\nthe PowerShell as well as maybe I already\n\n193\n00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:57.357\nhave a VHD file, maybe I have a VM\nas well and I wanna go ahead and\n\n194\n00:10:57.357 --> 00:10:59.805\ntake that disk and\nI want to attach it to a VM.\n\n195\n00:10:59.805 --> 00:11:00.899\nIs that something we can do?\n\n196\n00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:04.243\nWe definitely can, because sometimes\nwe might want to go ahead and\n\n197\n00:11:04.243 --> 00:11:08.000\ncreate those disks and just have them\nready for on an as needed basis.\n\n198\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.450\nSo lets take a look at how we would add\na VHD or VHDX to a existing machine here.\n\n199\n00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.920\nSo here in PowerShell,\ngo ahead and take a look.\n\n200\n00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.390\nNow, the commandlet here\nis a little bit different,\n\n201\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.250\nits not just VHD than\nwhat we had been using.\n\n202\n00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:26.380\nAnd you'll notice some of the commandments\nthat use virtual hard disk or\n\n203\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.600\nvirtual disk drive.\n\n204\n00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.570\nI should say virtual or\n\n205\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.095\nhard disk drive if I can speak correctly,\nyou'll see when I type it here.\n\n206\n00:11:32.095 --> 00:11:36.072\nSo it's just a slightly different\nway of typing that out.\n\n207\n00:11:36.072 --> 00:11:41.506\nSo here we'll go ahead and do add, dash,\nand this is going to be that VM hard disk.\n\n208\n00:11:41.506 --> 00:11:48.910\nSo VM and I'll try to keep it,\n\n209\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.450\nyou know capitalized, so you can kind\nof see how you have that extra D there.\n\n210\n00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.257\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nsay VM hard disk drive.\n\n211\n00:11:55.257 --> 00:11:58.557\nNow, here I have to specify the name\nof the virtual machine that I want to\n\n212\n00:11:58.557 --> 00:11:59.226\nattach it to.\n\n213\n00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:03.440\nSo I'm gonna say VMName and\nthe name of my virtual machine or\n\n214\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.710\nour virtual machine that we had created\nalready, remember from that last show,\n\n215\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.480\nis PLABCONFIG and that was CONFIGVM.\n\n216\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.820\nSo that's the name of the machine\nwe're gonna be attaching it to.\n\n217\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.507\nAnd then again, this is where you guys are\nprobably already familiar with specifying\n\n218\n00:12:18.507 --> 00:12:22.606\nthat path and you probably already know\nwhere I'm gonna get that from, and\n\n219\n00:12:22.606 --> 00:12:24.321\nthat's going to be in our VHD.\n\n220\n00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:29.142\nOops, I keep putting my shift there,\nso that's going to be,\n\n221\n00:12:29.142 --> 00:12:33.150\nlet's see the PHD and\nwe'll go with our fix there.\n\n222\n00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.997\nSo PowerShell fixed and that one was,\nI keep forgetting if we\n\n223\n00:12:37.997 --> 00:12:42.573\nhad converted it or not but\nthat was our VHDX, all right.\n\n224\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.880\nAnd I think that that's it,\nyeah that's it.\n\n225\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.412\nAnd so now,\nthat particular drive is attached.\n\n226\n00:12:53.412 --> 00:12:57.603\nSo one way that you could verify this,\nand I could have ran this command\n\n227\n00:12:57.603 --> 00:13:01.367\nbefore to just check, but it's okay,\nwe can go ahead and run it\n\n228\n00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:06.620\nnow to see how many drives are associated\nwith a particular virtual machine.\n\n229\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.550\nAnd so, the one way you can\ndo that here in PowerShell is\n\n230\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.670\nby pulling an identifier,\nthe VM ID and looking it up that way,\n\n231\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.940\nbut it's this ridiculously\nlong alpha numeric number.\n\n232\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.750\nAnd Wes, I can barely even\nremember phone numbers these days.\n\n233\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.190\nSo I'm gonna show you how\nI prefer to go ahead and\n\n234\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.313\nlook at that information just\nto make it a little bit easier.\n\n235\n00:13:29.313 --> 00:13:33.953\nAnd I'm gonna use some information piped\nout to help me drill down to a specific\n\n236\n00:13:33.953 --> 00:13:35.450\nmachine that way.\n\n237\n00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.440\nSo what I'm gonna do here\nis I'm gonna type the get.\n\n238\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.952\nMove my cursor so you can see this.\n\n239\n00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:45.890\n&gt;&gt; Get-VM -VMName and\n\n240\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:51.540\nagain we'll specify our machine\nPLAVCONFIG, I think about that for\n\n241\n00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.210\na second, VM and now,\nwe've specified this machine.\n\n242\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.340\nSo we'll take that information,\npipe it up into a select object.\n\n243\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:03.630\nSo I'm telling it what I wanna\nreally like filter down to,\n\n244\n00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:09.590\nAll right, and\nthen I'm gonna take that output.\n\n245\n00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.830\nOops, excuse me, the object here,\nI do have to specify my object,\n\n246\n00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.100\nthat's going to be that\nVMid that I told you about.\n\n247\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.550\nSo I don't have to have that memorized or\nhave it handy there.\n\n248\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.408\nSo I'm gonna take that information,\nand then pipe that one out to\n\n249\n00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:29.360\nGet-VHD, all right?\n\n250\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.500\nNow, this output is going to display\n\n251\n00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.020\nthose drives that are attached\nto that specific machine.\n\n252\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:41.083\nSo let's see what we have here, so for\nthis first particular drive, we can see\n\n253\n00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:45.934\na dynamic drive, we can see the size,\nwe can even see the name of the drive.\n\n254\n00:14:45.934 --> 00:14:49.163\nLet me go ahead and make sure I'm\nall the way up at the top here,\n\n255\n00:14:49.163 --> 00:14:50.794\nI don't wanna miss anything.\n\n256\n00:14:50.794 --> 00:14:56.341\nAll right, the name of the drive here for\nthe path, we can see that this is the VHDX\n\n257\n00:14:56.341 --> 00:15:02.010\nfile that was created when we had\noriginally created that virtual machine.\n\n258\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.505\nWell, that last drive that we just\nattached to that machine if you\n\n259\n00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:10.278\nremember that was our right\nhere our PHSFIXED.VHDX.\n\n260\n00:15:10.278 --> 00:15:13.877\nSo by running this command,\nI can see hey, that was successful,\n\n261\n00:15:13.877 --> 00:15:18.458\nbecause like you said Wes, sometimes in\nPowerShell, you're not always gonna get\n\n262\n00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:22.370\nthose glaring notifications\nthat you did something correct.\n\n263\n00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.490\nSo that's just one way you could verify,\nyou may have a different way,\n\n264\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.310\nbut that's or you may memorize VMID,\nmore power to you if you can do that.\n\n265\n00:15:31.738 --> 00:15:36.610\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nclear the screen,\n\n266\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:42.440\nI do just want to remember an addition to\nusing PowerShell to obtain information.\n\n267\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.580\nRemember, you do have the ability to\nobtain that information and the graphical\n\n268\n00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.313\nuser interface and do those edits like\nwe had seen in the previous show.\n\n269\n00:15:50.313 --> 00:15:52.145\nIf you ever wanna remove a drive,\n\n270\n00:15:52.145 --> 00:15:55.360\nthere are a few things that you\ndo need to be familiar with.\n\n271\n00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.529\nThey're gonna ask you for\nthree required parameters.\n\n272\n00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:03.448\nYou're gonna need to know the controller,\nyou're gonna need to know the location,\n\n273\n00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:06.640\nand the other one there,\nthe number and the location.\n\n274\n00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.679\nSo the controller,\nnumber, and the location.\n\n275\n00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:11.528\nSo let's just see, remember,\n\n276\n00:16:11.528 --> 00:16:14.960\nwe can edit that here within\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n277\n00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.640\nSo let's say real quick here, I'll\nchange this from IDE to SCSI controller.\n\n278\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.272\nThat's fine, we'll keep it at\nlocation one and I'll hit apply, and\n\n279\n00:16:25.272 --> 00:16:30.311\nlet me pull PowerShell back up and just\nshow you kind of what that looks like.\n\n280\n00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:34.847\nIf you forget those three parameters,\ndon't worry about it because the operating\n\n281\n00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:39.184\nsystem will prompt you for them, and\nthen that'll kind of remind you, hey,\n\n282\n00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:43.068\nI do need to know,\n[LAUGH] what to specify here specifically.\n\n283\n00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:47.580\nSo the commandlet that we're gonna\nbe using is the remove- and again,\n\n284\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.230\nthis is where we see that VM hard\ndisk drive instead of the other.\n\n285\n00:16:55.766 --> 00:17:02.436\nAnd I also need to specify the name of my\nvirtual machine that I'm removing it from,\n\n286\n00:17:02.436 --> 00:17:09.440\nso here this is going to be VMName,\nand that's our PLABCONFIGVM machine.\n\n287\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.370\nSo if I wanted to go ahead and\nadd the controller, the number, and\n\n288\n00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.420\nthe location here.\n\n289\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.970\nI could do that just by doing a dash\ncontroller and then specifying IDE or\n\n290\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.740\nSCSI, but what if I just hit Enter?\n\n291\n00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.240\nWell, then it's gonna ask me,\nwhat is the controller type?\n\n292\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.950\nSo I would just type in SCSI here and\nhit Enter, and\n\n293\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.660\nthen it's like you forgot the controller\nnumber, and I'm like yeah, I did.\n\n294\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.250\nSo I'll go ahead and put the controller\nnumber, and then again, it's gonna ask for\n\n295\n00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.340\nthat location there, and that's it.\n\n296\n00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:40.290\nI mean, you could also see here,\nlet me see if it refreshed.\n\n297\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.166\nUnder that SCSI, let me just go ahead and\nclose out of it, and\n\n298\n00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:47.903\nthen go back into the settings there,\nso you can see that.\n\n299\n00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:53.110\nUnder SCSI you can see that it's now gone.\n\n300\n00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.080\nSo that's one way you could go ahead and\nremove it.\n\n301\n00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.509\nSo I think that's about it for now Wes.\n\n302\n00:17:58.509 --> 00:18:00.401\nI definitely would encourage\nyou to go through and\n\n303\n00:18:00.401 --> 00:18:02.750\nmake sure you are familiar with\nworking with those commands.\n\n304\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.210\nBut I think that's enough to get your\nfeet wet and get you running there.\n\n305\n00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good,\na lot of great information.\n\n306\n00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.040\nLove the PowerShell,\nyou've mentioned it in other episodes.\n\n307\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.740\nIf they don't code a button in\nthe Graphical User Interface.\n\n308\n00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.340\nWell, that's okay, that's the benefits\nof dropping down to the PowerShell and\n\n309\n00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.550\nlearning those cmdlets.\n\n310\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.580\nAnd you definitely have to know them for\nthe exam.\n\n311\n00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.654\nCherokee, I think you did a great job,\nbut before we do take off.\n\n312\n00:18:23.654 --> 00:18:26.820\nDo you have any final words that you like\nto let our viewers know when it comes to\n\n313\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.840\nworking with PowerShell in their VM's.\n\n314\n00:18:28.840 -->

Francisco.\n\n3\n00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:12.064\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:14.685\n&gt;&gt; Hello everyone, thanks for\ntuning in to ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.571\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through\n\n6\n00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:23.382\nour series in the 70-410 Exam, that's\nright, the MCSA and Windows Server 2012.\n\n7\n00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:25.777\nAnd joining us back in the studios\nis miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:25.777 --> 00:00:26.805\nCherokee, how you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:27.884\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\nthank you for asking Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:28.894\nHow are you today?\n\n11\n00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:30.060\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing pretty good.\n\n12\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.581\nIn the last few episodes,\n\n13\n00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:35.190\nwe've been talking all about\nthings like Hyper-V, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.410\nThings like our virtual machines creating\nthem, we've talked about the storage too.\n\n15\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.370\nWe've seen it in\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n16\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.615\nWe also have an episode on how to\nconfigure things like DHD files in\n\n17\n00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:45.500\nthe PowerShell.\n\n18\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.993\nHowever, we still got a few additional\noptions that we need to look at, and\n\n19\n00:00:48.993 --> 00:00:51.997\nthat's what we're gonna be dealing\nwith here in this episode.\n\n20\n00:00:51.997 --> 00:00:53.403\nSo Cherokee,\nwhere we're starting out here?\n\n21\n00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we've kind of joked around,\nWes, and said, hey,\n\n22\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.796\nwhat if we mess something up or\nmake a wrong configuration to that note,\n\n23\n00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:03.020\nis there anything we can do to kinda\nprotect ourselves in that way?\n\n24\n00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.445\nThey didn't forget about that here in\nour virtual environment either, so\n\n25\n00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:09.340\nthere's something called checkpoints.\n\n26\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.416\nNow, prior to Server 2012 R2,\nthey were called snapshots.\n\n27\n00:01:14.416 --> 00:01:19.212\nSo for those exam-takers out there, don't\nbe surprised, you may see it both ways,\n\n28\n00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:21.090\neither checkpoint or snapshot.\n\n29\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.081\nIt means the same thing here,\nso don't be alarmed by that.\n\n30\n00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:28.092\nAnd basically, what a checkpoint is,\n\n31\n00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:33.749\nit's a picture of information such\nas the state hardware configurations\n\n32\n00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:39.149\nsurrounding that virtual machine,\nfor a particular moment in time.\n\n33\n00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.834\nSo there are couple good great things\nabout utilizing checkpoints, but\n\n34\n00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:48.457\nthere are also a couple of things that\nyou might wanna consider as well.\n\n35\n00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:53.949\nBecause in a production environment,\nyou might not wanna be using them heavily.\n\n36\n00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:57.865\nA few may be okay, but you can really\nkind of creep up on yourself with\n\n37\n00:01:57.865 --> 00:02:01.676\nthe storage there,\nif you're creating multiple checkpoints.\n\n38\n00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:07.648\nThose are actual files and\nthey're gonna be stored as your .AVDH or\n\n39\n00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:12.361\n.AVDHX, depending on if that\nactual drive is a VDH or\n\n40\n00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:15.955\nVDHX file, like we spoke about before.\n\n41\n00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:19.560\nSo you just wanna keep an eye on\nthat storage there, number one.\n\n42\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.053\nAnd also, being number two, that it does\ninterfere with this disc subsystem as\n\n43\n00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:28.567\nwell, so you don't wanna decrease\nperformance in a production environment.\n\n44\n00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.883\nI mean if you think about it, we're always\ntrying to increase performance, and\n\n45\n00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:33.661\nwhat can we do to streamline this machine.\n\n46\n00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.510\nSo checkpoints should be\nused sparingly there.\n\n47\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.460\nAll right, so let's go ahead and take a\nlook at how we could create a checkpoint.\n\n48\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.416\nSo here in Hyper-V, I'm just going\nto go ahead and pull up a Windows 8\n\n49\n00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:51.383\nmachine here, and we'll connect to\nthat machine, give it a second.\n\n50\n00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:58.266\nAnd I'm going to transform into Wes for\nthis particular demonstration.\n\n51\n00:02:58.266 --> 00:02:59.655\nBet you guys weren't expecting that.\n\n52\n00:02:59.655 --> 00:03:02.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't think Wes was either,\n\n53\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.251\nhe's like looking at me like, okay.\n\n54\n00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:08.831\n[COUGH] Yeah, but really I'm actually\ngonna be logging on as the administrator\n\n55\n00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:10.797\nhere, if this machine will spin up for me.\n\n56\n00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:16.524\nAnd this is just going to be\na PRACTICELABS\\administrator,\n\n57\n00:03:16.524 --> 00:03:19.430\nyou guys know this super secret password,\npassword.\n\n58\n00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.411\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlog on and get to our desktop.\n\n59\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.299\nNow, let's say, me, being Wes,\nwas working on a really important project.\n\n60\n00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.361\nAnd so here I am on my desktop, and\nlet's create a new folder here,\n\n61\n00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:40.629\nand we'll just name it important.\n\n62\n00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:45.950\nIf I can spell important.\n\n63\n00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.000\n&gt;&gt; It really is me, the way you type.\n\n64\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.241\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's all right.\n\n65\n00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:53.340\nSo now I have my super\nimportant work here, right?\n\n66\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.880\nAnd I don't want anyone messing with it.\n\n67\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.192\nAnd I'm Wes, so I'm smart,\nand I'm like, hey,\n\n68\n00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:03.065\nI wanna go ahead and create a checkpoint\nhere, so I don't lose all my work.\n\n69\n00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:06.572\n[LAUGH] What are you laughing at, Wes?\n\n70\n00:04:06.572 --> 00:04:08.400\nYou're over there laughing.\n\n71\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.020\nIt's all right.\n\n72\n00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.650\nSo here I'm gonna go under my action\nmenu in my top left corner, and\n\n73\n00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.940\nthen I'm gonna select checkpoint.\n\n74\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.273\nSo it's really not a difficult\nprocess to go ahead and\n\n75\n00:04:18.273 --> 00:04:21.607\nwalk through, and\nwe've talked about this before,\n\n76\n00:04:21.607 --> 00:04:25.326\njust being really logical in\nnaming conventions and such.\n\n77\n00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:28.897\nNow, this is a client-side machine, and\nif Wes were working at home or something,\n\n78\n00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:32.141\nthat would be his prerogative,\nwhatever he wanted to name his checkpoint.\n\n79\n00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:35.432\nBut personally, if I'm working in\nan enterprise environment, I wanna keep\n\n80\n00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:38.737\nsomething, I showed you guys before\nwhen we were dealing with checkpoints.\n\n81\n00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:42.300\nMaybe put the date included in\nthe name of that checkpoint, or\n\n82\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.945\nany kind of reason as to why you\nwere creating that checkpoint.\n\n83\n00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:48.366\nSo Wes maybe just wants to save his work.\n\n84\n00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:51.518\nBut let's say maybe Wes was gonna\nhave some kind of system change.\n\n85\n00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:55.180\nHe was changing hardware or\ninstalling a new update.\n\n86\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.730\nWhatever that change may be, you might\nwanna note that in the name as well.\n\n87\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.298\nBut here, we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll say month month day day year year,\n\n88\n00:05:04.298 --> 00:05:06.520\nbecause I'm really creative with that.\n\n89\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.831\nAll right, so maybe Wes has to go\nto the restroom, or go running or\n\n90\n00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:17.432\nsomething like that, and\nhe forgets to lock his computer.\n\n91\n00:05:17.432 --> 00:05:21.537\nAnd Cherokee, being the evil\nperson she is, comes by and says,\n\n92\n00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:25.807\nhey I'm gonna go ahead delete\nWes' really important files here.\n\n93\n00:05:25.807 --> 00:05:30.121\nAnd maybe Wes just really\naggravated me yesterday, and\n\n94\n00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:33.436\nI even deleted them out\nof the recycle bin.\n\n95\n00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:38.028\nSo we'll just say hey,\nwe're gonna empty that recycle bin, and\n\n96\n00:05:38.028 --> 00:05:42.972\nI think I'm being super sinister and\nsneaky here, and that's that.\n\n97\n00:05:42.972 --> 00:05:47.136\nBut because Wes was smarter about it,\nand he had created that checkpoint,\n\n98\n00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:51.647\nhe now has the ability to go under this\noption menu, and then just select Revert.\n\n99\n00:05:51.647 --> 00:05:54.059\nSo we get the notification here,\n\n100\n00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:59.250\ndo you want to revert this virtual\nmachine to its previous checkpoint?\n\n101\n00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.040\nNow, we do have the ability to select\nwhich, if we have multiple checkpoints,\n\n102\n00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.420\nwe can select which checkpoint\nwe want to revert to.\n\n103\n00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.880\nBut since I just have this one right now,\nI'll go ahead and say let's revert there.\n\n104\n00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.593\nSo it's going to power down the machine.\n\n105\n00:06:12.593 --> 00:06:15.783\nIt's a virtual machine,\nit's gonna be making those changes,\n\n106\n00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:16.914\npulling them back in.\n\n107\n00:06:16.914 --> 00:06:20.585\nAnd now we can see that that\nactual folder is there and\n\n108\n00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:24.500\noperating the system will pull that in for\nme.\n\n109\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.125\nNow, let me just minimize this, and what\nI wanna show you from the server side,\n\n110\n00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:31.140\nwhat it looks like here in this interface.\n\n111\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.720\nYou can see where those\ncheckpoints reside.\n\n112\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.390\nSo for each one of these virtual\nmachines from the top pane,\n\n113\n00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.650\nif I were to select on those, and\nyou can see PLAP when 802 is selected,\n\n114\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.330\nthat's what I'm looking at right here.\n\n115\n00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.705\nAnd let me just zoom in a little bit.\n\n116\n00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:51.337\nYou can see the name of that checkpoint\nthat we just created, of MMDDYY.\n\n117\n00:06:51.337 --> 00:06:55.124\nNow, this is that subtree and\nit works in a hierarchical,\n\n118\n00:06:55.124 --> 00:06:59.682\nalmost like a timeline, if you will,\nto show you that point in time for\n\n119\n00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:03.888\nthe different checkpoints that\nwere created for each machine.\n\n120\n00:07:03.888 --> 00:07:09.192\nSo if I were to go ahead and right-click\nand then actually delete this checkpoint,\n\n121\n00:07:09.192 --> 00:07:13.966\nI have the option here, you could\ndelete the checkpoint individually, or\n\n122\n00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:17.250\nyou can delete that\ncheckpoint in any subsequent.\n\n123\n00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.976\nSo if I made a mistake, and then had\ncreated a checkpoint after that mistake\n\n124\n00:07:21.976 --> 00:07:26.788\nhad been made, I can continue to revert\nback to that previous point in time.\n\n125\n00:07:26.788 --> 00:07:30.731\nSo I'm just gonna say delete this\ncheckpoint and the subtree here.\n\n126\n00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:37.268\nI do get a warning,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n127\n00:07:37.268 --> 00:07:40.922\nThis is something that we don't wanna,\nyou can see the margin happening here for\n\n128\n00:07:40.922 --> 00:07:44.432\nthe status of that machine also, well,\njust sitting here, just note that.\n\n129\n00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:49.411\nNow, okay, we can see that\nthat merge had been succeeded,\n\n130\n00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:53.206\nso if I go and\nI pull this machine back up here.\n\n131\n00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:58.268\nAnd now this time, if I were to,\nit's just noting about my.\n\n132\n00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:02.728\nI'm in multiple layers of virtualization\nhere guys, so my commands and my mouse\n\n133\n00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:08.170\naren't perfect going through, but we'll\nget there, just so I can show you this.\n\n134\n00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.252\nBut now if I go to delete that folder.\n\n135\n00:08:10.252 --> 00:08:13.628\nAnd again empty this recycle bin, right?\n\n136\n00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:18.334\nThis is just giving me my warnings here.\n\n137\n00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:27.648\nWhen I go to perform that revert here,\nI don't have anything to revert back to.\n\n138\n00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:30.509\nSo it will let me up here\nas if it's reverting, but\n\n139\n00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:34.602\nwe hadn't created a checkpoint,\nsince that file was actually there,\n\n140\n00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:39.263\nbecause we had deleted that checkpoint\nin the subtree, so it's pretty simple.\n\n141\n00:08:39.263 --> 00:08:40.747\nYou guys get this.\n\n142\n00:08:40.747 --> 00:08:43.645\nBut just be kinda be\nfamiliar with it there.\n\n143\n00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:44.623\nI'm trying to think,\n\n144\n00:08:44.623 --> 00:08:47.720\nis there anything else I wanna talk\nto you guys about checkpoints here.\n\n145\n00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.830\nWe can go ahead and log back in\nif you wanted to, just to verify.\n\n146\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.544\nYeah, let's do that.\n\n147\n00:08:55.544 --> 00:08:56.785\nIt'll just take a second here.\n\n148\n00:08:58.445 --> 00:09:01.375\nIs there a time where checkpoints\nmight not be a good fit?\n\n149\n00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:02.905\nWell, perhaps.\n\n150\n00:09:02.905 --> 00:09:07.803\nSo if you think about the logic\nbehind how this checkpoint is stored,\n\n151\n00:09:07.803 --> 00:09:13.052\nI told you it's just a file with that\n.avhd or vhdx file extension there.\n\n152\n00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:17.620\nSo if you think about it from a malware\nperspective, because it is a file,\n\n153\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.080\npotentially that file\ncould be infected as well.\n\n154\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.380\nSo where these checkpoints\nare really good for,\n\n155\n00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.220\nare going to be really for\nconfiguration errors.\n\n156\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.140\nI really wouldn't rely on that.\n\n157\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.199\nYou may be able to use it for\na malware fixed,\n\n158\n00:09:33.199 --> 00:09:36.606\nbut I definitely wouldn't\ncount on that there.\n\n159\n00:09:36.606 --> 00:09:38.450\nSo here-\n&gt;&gt; And I wanted to just jump in here and\n\n160\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.220\nask, because you've mentioned in a past\nepisode, now same thing applies and\n\n161\n00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.000\nI wanna kinda just bring it back up.\n\n162\n00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.782\nBecause if you haven't seen the episode\nthere, these aren't a replacement for\n\n163\n00:09:47.782 --> 00:09:48.483\nbackups, right?\n\n164\n00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:49.984\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Checkpoints are not, hey,\n\n165\n00:09:49.984 --> 00:09:53.080\nwe got a checkpoint here,\nI don't need to perform a backup.\n\n166\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.720\nYou still wanna do that as part of\nnormal system maintenance, right?\n\n167\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.783\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean I would say if you have\na configuration error, it's less invasive\n\n168\n00:09:59.783 --> 00:10:03.453\nthan going through that process,\njust to roll back to that checkpoint.\n\n169\n00:10:03.453 --> 00:10:08.398\nBut in that example with the malware,\nif that checkpoint was corrupt, and\n\n170\n00:10:08.398 --> 00:10:11.548\nwhat do you do at that\nparticular point in time?\n\n171\n00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:14.812\nMaybe you stopped taking your backups\nbecause you thought checkpoints were\n\n172\n00:10:14.812 --> 00:10:17.413\na good substitution,\nthen you have nothing to fall back on.\n\n173\n00:10:17.413 --> 00:10:20.374\nSo there really is no substitution for\nthose backups.\n\n174\n00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:24.079\nWe have a lot of different technologies\nthat we can stack and layer, but\n\n175\n00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:26.950\ndefinitely not a full-fledged\nsubstitution there.\n\n176\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.350\nGood point Wes.\n\n177\n00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.660\nAll right, so you can see guys,\nwe didn't get our folder back.\n\n178\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.468\nI'm sorry Wes, you need to go and\nredo all of your important work there.\n\n179\n00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.641\n&gt;&gt; Darn.\n\n180\n00:10:36.641 --> 00:10:40.545\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, the next thing I'd\nlike to talk to you guys about,\n\n181\n00:10:40.545 --> 00:10:45.641\nwhat I'd like to talk to you about, is\nsomething called a fiber channel adapter.\n\n182\n00:10:45.641 --> 00:10:48.361\nThis is another one of those topics that,\nWes,\n\n183\n00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:51.014\nI don't have a fiber\nchannel here in studios.\n\n184\n00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:55.912\nI wish I did but they might have to let\nme go, so they could afford one here,\n\n185\n00:10:55.912 --> 00:10:58.532\nbecause these could be rather costly.\n\n186\n00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:00.994\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely-\n&gt;&gt; When we're talking about storage area.\n\n187\n00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:01.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.351\n&gt;&gt; I have $120,000 sitting in my back\n\n189\n00:11:03.351 --> 00:11:05.390\npocket right here, we'll just go\nget a fiber channel switch and\n\n190\n00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.205\nlay the fabric, right?\n\n191\n00:11:06.205 --> 00:11:07.148\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know,\n\n192\n00:11:07.148 --> 00:11:09.258\nwe're talking like storage area networks.\n\n193\n00:11:09.258 --> 00:11:12.705\nI know this is in the class that\nwe should really be explaining it.\n\n194\n00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:16.945\nAnd because you guys should already know,\nat least that's what Microsoft's assuming\n\n195\n00:11:16.945 --> 00:11:20.628\nat this level for knowing that this is\nour high-speed storage option here.\n\n196\n00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:23.377\nWe're talking about a 2 gigabit,\n\n197\n00:11:23.377 --> 00:11:28.520\nusually we see that 2 gigabit or\n16 gigabit for our speeds here.\n\n198\n00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.018\nSo yeah, if you're lucky enough to\nwork with one, then that's cool.\n\n199\n00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:35.438\nAnd I will show you how to\nconfigure this in adapter,\n\n200\n00:11:35.438 --> 00:11:39.658\nbecause you may see that on the exam or\nsomething to that nature.\n\n201\n00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:43.136\nSo let's just go into Hyper-V,\nwe're already here,\n\n202\n00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:45.661\nlet me zoom out a little bit so\nwe can see.\n\n203\n00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:49.891\nOn the right hand side is where we\nneed to be, over in that right pane.\n\n204\n00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:53.794\nAnd you'll see this option it says,\nvirtual SAN manager.\n\n205\n00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:57.347\nSo we have to actually go in here and\ncreate an adapter,\n\n206\n00:11:57.347 --> 00:12:01.929\nbefore we can go individual virtual\nmachines and attach the adapter.\n\n207\n00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:06.193\nSo it's a pretty\nstraightforward wizard here.\n\n208\n00:12:06.193 --> 00:12:09.061\nYou see this option for\nvirtual fiber channel sands.\n\n209\n00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:12.857\nSo we'll go ahead and select create.\n\n210\n00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.900\nYou can name it whatever you want.\n\n211\n00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.100\nSo here,\nmaybe since we're using Practice Labs,\n\n212\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.710\nI'll just say PLABFC for fiber channel.\n\n213\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.947\nIn real life, of course, you'd always\nwanna take advantage of that notes option.\n\n214\n00:12:25.947 --> 00:12:26.988\nScroll down a little bit.\n\n215\n00:12:26.988 --> 00:12:29.044\nWe can go ahead and select okay.\n\n216\n00:12:29.044 --> 00:12:32.055\nAnd now that hardware\nwill be an option for us.\n\n217\n00:12:32.055 --> 00:12:35.800\nSo domain controller here.\n\n218\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.650\nLet's say, let's go ahead and\ngo to my settings, and move this over.\n\n219\n00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.822\nUnder the Add Hardware option,\nwe can see that the Fibre Channel adapter\n\n220\n00:12:47.822 --> 00:12:52.682\nis available to us, so\nwe'll highlight that, and then select Add.\n\n221\n00:12:52.682 --> 00:12:55.009\nAnd let me scroll down a little bit.\n\n222\n00:12:57.335 --> 00:13:01.926\nFor that virtual SAN option, I know\nit's a little small, let me zoom in so\n\n223\n00:13:01.926 --> 00:13:03.290\nyou can see.\n\n224\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:09.210\nBut this is that fiber channel that we\nhad just created, the PLABFC there.\n\n225\n00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:14.880\nSo not a whole lot to\nthe actual configuration\n\n226\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.300\nof adding that adapter there.\n\n227\n00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.274\nSo we'll just go ahead and select OK.\n\n228\n00:13:19.274 --> 00:13:20.980\nJust wanted to show you guys that,\nreal quick.\n\n229\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.470\n&gt;&gt; Now one of the things you had mentioned\nin one of the episodes when we were\n\n230\n00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.650\nconfiguring, is a quality of service,\nright?\n\n231\n00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.637\nWhen it comes to our storage.\n\n232\n00:13:28.637 --> 00:13:30.658\nBecause you've explained\nin other episodes,\n\n233\n00:13:30.658 --> 00:13:32.380\nwhen we were looking at memory, right?\n\n234\n00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.284\nWe have dynamic memory, we can configure\nthings like memory weight, you showed us\n\n235\n00:13:36.284 --> 00:13:40.329\nwhere we can give a little more priority\nto, maybe a more mission-critical server.\n\n236\n00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:44.140\nNow, is that something that\nwe can tailor to storage?\n\n237\n00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.116\nCan we bring some of those concepts\nover to storage and say hey, well,\n\n238\n00:13:47.116 --> 00:13:50.556\nI've got this one machine, I know it's\ngonna need a certain amount of storage.\n\n239\n00:13:50.556 --> 00:13:54.312\nAnd I wanna kinda make sure that\nit doesn't get over subscribed.\n\n240\n00:13:54.312 --> 00:13:59.665\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and so luckily we do have that\noption, Wes, because that is true.\n\n241\n00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:03.780\nDifferent machines do have different\nvarying levels of importance there.\n\n242\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.344\nSo let's just go ahead and go to the\nsettings of that virtual machine we had\n\n243\n00:14:07.344 --> 00:14:09.999\ncreated before, and\nwe had created different disks.\n\n244\n00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:14.770\nLet's see if we still have any\njust kind of sitting there.\n\n245\n00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.322\nLet's take a look at this hard drive\nattached to that virtual machine.\n\n246\n00:14:19.322 --> 00:14:22.621\nSo on the left hand side,\nyou can see a plus arrow.\n\n247\n00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:24.420\nNow, if you click on that,\n\n248\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.508\nit'll expand out to a subsection\ncalled advanced features.\n\n249\n00:14:28.508 --> 00:14:32.997\nAnd this is where we could actually\nenable our quality of service for\n\n250\n00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.975\nthe storage of those drives.\n\n251\n00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:37.925\nSo I could go ahead and\ncheck this tick box.\n\n252\n00:14:37.925 --> 00:14:41.838\nAnd this is where you would need\nto know specific information for\n\n253\n00:14:41.838 --> 00:14:45.981\nthat machine referencing those IOPS,\nfor those reads and writes.\n\n254\n00:14:45.981 --> 00:14:48.925\nEspecially if you are running\ncertain applications.\n\n255\n00:14:48.925 --> 00:14:53.431\nBut once you are able to monitor and use\nsome kind of metric to get those numbers,\n\n256\n00:14:53.431 --> 00:14:57.331\nyou could go ahead and set your upper and\nlower thresholds there, for\n\n257\n00:14:57.331 --> 00:14:59.162\nyour minimum and maximum IOPS.\n\n258\n00:14:59.162 --> 00:15:03.684\nAnd that is definitely how you would\njust set that, not too difficult.\n\n259\n00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:07.232\nAgain, you would need some kind of\nmonitoring utility to create your\n\n260\n00:15:07.232 --> 00:15:10.728\nbaseline, so you could input that\naccording to your environment.\n\n261\n00:15:10.728 --> 00:15:12.877\nBut that's really it.\n\n262\n00:15:12.877 --> 00:15:16.174\nAnd so it's just yelling at me here,\nbecause I didn't set anything there,\n\n263\n00:15:16.174 --> 00:15:18.143\nbut that's okay,\nI just wanted to show you.\n\n264\n00:15:18.143 --> 00:15:21.603\n&gt;&gt; Lot of great information, we've got\nadditional options that we can configure,\n\n265\n00:15:21.603 --> 00:15:24.414\nand things that we just need to\ntake into consideration when we're\n\n266\n00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:25.430\nconfiguring storage.\n\n267\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:29.121\nNow, again Cherokee, I know little\nbit shorter of an episode here.\n\n268\n00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:32.915\nBut we just had some loose ends\nthat you wanted to tie off, right?\n\n269\n00:15:32.915 --> 00:15:35.530\nMake sure that your shoelaces are tied and\nthat you're covered for that exam.\n\n270\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.557\nBut before we do sign off,\n\n271\n00:15:36.557 --> 00:15:39.746\ndo you have any additional words that\nmaybe you'd like to impart to our viewers?\n\n272\n00:15:39.746 --> 00:15:43.263\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so that was actually, yeah,\nthose were a few stragglers there,\n\n273\n00:15:43.263 --> 00:15:47.144\nthat I wanted to wrap up when we were\ntalking about our virtualization storage.\n\n274\n00:15:47.144 --> 00:15:51.051\nBut don't go anywhere, because we still\nneed to take a look at networking from\n\n275\n00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.720\na virtualization perspective.\n\n276\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.790\nSo you don't wanna miss that.\n\n277\n00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.099\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great\nstopping point there, Cherokee.\n\n278\n00:15:56.099 --> 00:15:57.152\nI know it's been great here.\n\n279\n00:15:57.152 --> 00:15:59.484\nI'm gonna grab me some coffee and\nStop by the HR department,\n\n280\n00:15:59.484 --> 00:16:01.418\nwe're gonna send Cherokee\nto anger management.\n\n281\n00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:02.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because she definitely picked on\n\n282\n00:16:02.932 --> 00:16:03.472\nme alive here.\n\n283\n00:16:03.472 --> 00:16:07.330\nBut until we see you again, signing\nout for ITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n284\n00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:07.943\nWes Bryan.\n\n285\n00:16:07.943 --> 00:16:08.742\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n286\n00:16:08.742 --> 00:16:11.047\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n287\n00:16:11.047 --> 00:16:17.223\n[MUSIC]\n\n288\n00:16:17.223 --> 00:16:20.688\nThank you for

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.989\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.768\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.768 --> 00:00:08.234\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:11.993\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.993 --> 00:00:14.467\n&gt;&gt; Hello to all our viewers out\nthere thanks for tuning in.\n\n6\n00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:17.880\nWe got a great show in store for\nyou today, I'm your show host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.191\nAnd in today's episode, we're continuing\nthrough our series in the 74-10 exam.\n\n8\n00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:25.540\nThat's right and we're gonna be\nlooking at Hyper V networking today.\n\n9\n00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.550\nAnd joining us back in the studios,\nnone other than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.570\nCherokee, how are you doing today?\n\n11\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.720\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great thank you for\nasking Wes, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, so we've been\ntalking about Hyper V pretty much\n\n13\n00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.760\na virtualization platform and one of\nthe things that we haven't talked about.\n\n14\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.157\nWe've talked about memory and CPU\nutilizations, we haven't talked about how\n\n15\n00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:44.399\nthey communicated with\nthe rest of the world right?\n\n16\n00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.117\nThe rest of the network and I think that's\nwhat we're gonna be looking at today.\n\n17\n00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:48.356\nSo where do we start?\n\n18\n00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:51.317\n&gt;&gt; So we need to think about,\njust like we would in a physical\n\n19\n00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.600\nnetworking environment,\nwhat kind of components are there?\n\n20\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.821\nHow does this communication transpire?\n\n21\n00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.870\nWhat layer are we operating?\n\n22\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.450\nJust kind of things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.100\nAnd it maybe a little bit strange because\nyeah, in a virtualized environment.\n\n24\n00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.550\nWe don't have those tangible components.\n\n25\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.980\nSo how is all of this happening?\n\n26\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.040\nIt's kind of interesting but\nif we take a look at my screen,\n\n27\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.030\nI just wanna start out with the idea of\nlayer two, switching technology here.\n\n28\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.750\nSo, in networking we have switches\nthat provide that communication\n\n29\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.880\nlooking at that layer two information.\n\n30\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.600\nAnd we can implement things VLANs and\nwe utilize MAC addresses,\n\n31\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.570\nand what are some terms you might\nhave heard for MAC addresses?\n\n32\n00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.641\nWell, just think about\nthat physical address and\n\n33\n00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.808\nwe're in a virtual we don't have\nphysical and it's just getting strange.\n\n34\n00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:40.794\nSo I think breaking it down and\n\n35\n00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:45.095\ntaking it piece by piece is what\nwe'll be looking at here today.\n\n36\n00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:47.904\nAnd I think switches\nare a great place to start.\n\n37\n00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:50.733\nIt is a little bit different Wes,\nit's not gonna\n\n38\n00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:54.743\nbe the same as our traditional\nswitch in a virtualized environment.\n\n39\n00:01:54.743 --> 00:01:58.840\nWe have a couple of different ways\nthat we can configure them and\n\n40\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.273\nMicrosoft expects us to be able to know\nthe difference between their terminology.\n\n41\n00:02:04.273 --> 00:02:07.330\nAnd the ways that these switches\ncan be configured here.\n\n42\n00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.068\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nNow,\n\n43\n00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:10.903\nI'm not too familiar with some\nof the terminology here, but\n\n44\n00:02:10.903 --> 00:02:14.637\none thing that I know that is kinda common\nin virtualization platforms is that.\n\n45\n00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:18.111\nThere are different types of\ncommunications that your virtual\n\n46\n00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:19.099\nmachines can do.\n\n47\n00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.109\nAnd what I mean more specifically\nby that is that you have ways and\n\n48\n00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.641\nother virtualization techniques where\nyour hosts can communicate with\n\n49\n00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:29.510\nthe guest operating system.\n\n50\n00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.536\nThe guest operating system sometimes they\ncan communicate just amongst themselves or\n\n51\n00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:35.366\nmaybe with the host operating system.\n\n52\n00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:39.026\nThen we have certain types of\ncommunications where our virtual machine\n\n53\n00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.955\nthey act like any other physical\nmachine on our network.\n\n54\n00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:44.746\nIs that something that we're gonna\nsee inside Hyper V different kind of\n\n55\n00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:46.170\ncommunications like that.\n\n56\n00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.190\n&gt;&gt; You know Wes,\nyou hit the nail right on the head there.\n\n57\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.400\nThat's exactly what we'll\nsee here in Hyper V and\n\n58\n00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.550\nMicrosoft's virtualization solution.\n\n59\n00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.220\nNow, if you've already been working\nwith some other virtualization solution,\n\n60\n00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.360\nthen you may have the concept,\nthe fundamentals there but\n\n61\n00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.280\nyou just might call it\nsomething slightly different.\n\n62\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.156\nSo knowing the terminology is\ngonna be key here, especially for\n\n63\n00:03:07.156 --> 00:03:08.820\nyou exam takers out there.\n\n64\n00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.050\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\n\n65\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.140\nwe'll walk through the process of how\nwe can actually create a virtual switch\n\n66\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.350\nright here, I have already\npulled up my Hyper V Manager.\n\n67\n00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.074\nSo, on the right hand side, a couple of\ndifferent ways you can get here actually,\n\n68\n00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:27.921\nin the right hand pane over here it says,\nVirtual Switch Manager.\n\n69\n00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:32.092\nAlternatively, on\nthe left hand side if you\n\n70\n00:03:32.092 --> 00:03:36.161\nare managing multiple hyper V hosts here.\n\n71\n00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:39.945\nYou could also just right click\non your selected host and\n\n72\n00:03:39.945 --> 00:03:42.530\nthen select Virtual Switch Manager.\n\n73\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.410\nSo either way it takes\nyou to the same place.\n\n74\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.260\nThis is the Virtual Switch Manager\n\n75\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.340\ninterface that you see right\nhere that we'll be working with.\n\n76\n00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.173\nI'm trying to get a good spot for\nit, so you can see it well.\n\n77\n00:03:54.173 --> 00:03:58.484\nNow, you'll notice I have a couple that\nare already here that had been created and\n\n78\n00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:01.859\nso I'm using practice labs and\nyou guys have access to this too,\n\n79\n00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.640\nand can follow along if you'd like.\n\n80\n00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.482\nI have my actual physical network\ninterface card represented here\n\n81\n00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:10.438\nthat Intel.\n\n82\n00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:12.950\nAnd then they've had a couple\nthat are already created.\n\n83\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.140\nWe've got PLAB, PLAB private and\nwe'll be creating our own here as well.\n\n84\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.377\nYou can click on each one of these to\nlook more extensively at the properties\n\n85\n00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:24.811\nassociated with that individual switch.\n\n86\n00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:28.978\nBut this first option up here at\nthe top is where we're going to\n\n87\n00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:31.270\nbe creating a new switch.\n\n88\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.130\nNow, the first thing you'll notice once\nI highlight this new virtual switch\n\n89\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.080\noption over here on my left,\nI've got a couple different.\n\n90\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.690\nIt says, what type of virtual\nswitch do you want to create?\n\n91\n00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.940\nNow this is exactly what\nWes was talking about.\n\n92\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.260\nWe have the option to create external,\ninternal and private.\n\n93\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.130\nNow if you've never heard\nthose terms before,\n\n94\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.720\nMicrosoft does an actually a pretty\ngood job right down here of specifying\n\n95\n00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.270\nwhat each one of those terms means.\n\n96\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.570\nSo it says hey, If you click on external,\n\n97\n00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.800\nit creates a virtual switch that binds\nto the physical network adapter so\n\n98\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.610\nthat virtual machines can\naccess a physical network.\n\n99\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.190\nAnd so what that means is binding, or\n\n100\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.200\nmarrying our virtual switch to that\nphysical network interface card.\n\n101\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.254\nI'm able to leverage and utilize that\nhardware and traverse it, meaning I'm\n\n102\n00:05:24.254 --> 00:05:29.480\nable to leave my little hypervised\nbubble here, my virtual environment.\n\n103\n00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.470\nI can actually get onto the wire and\ngo through that network interface card and\n\n104\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.110\nout to my land,\nout to the Internet if I choose to do so.\n\n105\n00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.010\nSo I'm actually leveraging\nthat hardware there.\n\n106\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.830\nAnd I don't know,\nhere in the United States,\n\n107\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.970\npolygamy I still don't think that's legal.\n\n108\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.040\nSo when you marry to that physical\nnetwork interface card per switch.\n\n109\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.735\nYou're not allowed to marry that physical\nnetwork interface card to another switch.\n\n110\n00:05:56.735 --> 00:05:59.515\nSo for\nevery external switch that you create,\n\n111\n00:05:59.515 --> 00:06:04.777\nyou have to have to have a corresponding\nphysical network interface card there.\n\n112\n00:06:04.777 --> 00:06:08.397\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, I know this episode\nreally isn't about security but\n\n113\n00:06:08.397 --> 00:06:10.837\nthat you say leaving\nthat virtualized bubble.\n\n114\n00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:14.939\nDoes that mean that if the communications\ncan happen like any other physical machine\n\n115\n00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.376\ndoes that mean that we do\nhave a security concern?\n\n116\n00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:20.983\nAnd we gotta watch what we're doing\nbecause with those machines being\n\n117\n00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:22.947\nable to talk to the physical network.\n\n118\n00:06:22.947 --> 00:06:24.830\nAnything that happens to those machines,\n\n119\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.870\ncan also reflect the physical\nmachines on our network as well.\n\n120\n00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.264\n&gt;&gt; You know, Wes when we talk,\nlook at it from that perspective,\n\n121\n00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:31.447\nfrom a security perspective.\n\n122\n00:06:31.447 --> 00:06:36.096\nIf you are using virtualization in\na production environment you always wanna\n\n123\n00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:41.330\ntake that into consideration, yeah if this\nmachine is extending my local realm here.\n\n124\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.340\nI do need to treat it just as I would\nany other physical machine on my network\n\n125\n00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.290\nand you know what?\n\n126\n00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.000\nMaybe you're right.\n\n127\n00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000\nMaybe there's a reason why I don't want\nthat machine to have any kind of external\n\n128\n00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.170\ncommunication.\n\n129\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.420\nAnd I'd like to chose one of these other\noptions, I may opt for an internal.\n\n130\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.410\nSo, let's take at look at\nwhat that entails here.\n\n131\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.146\nInternals are great for like your just\nmentioning there maybe I want to set up\n\n132\n00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:07.740\na test environment before actually\ndeploy and roll it out to production.\n\n133\n00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.123\nSo let's read the description and\n\n134\n00:07:10.123 --> 00:07:15.547\nI'll give a little bit of a use case here\nit says, creates a virtual switch that\n\n135\n00:07:15.547 --> 00:07:20.825\ncan be used only by the virtual machines\nthat run on this physical computer.\n\n136\n00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:24.730\nAnd between the virtual machines and\nthe physical computer.\n\n137\n00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.830\nAn internal switch does not provide\nconnectivity to a physical switch\n\n138\n00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.450\nnetwork connection.\n\n139\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.850\nSo what does that mean?\n\n140\n00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.910\nSo, I'm not able to communicate with\nvirtual machines on another physical box,\n\n141\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.540\nI'm only able to communicate\nwith virtual machines residing\n\n142\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.900\non one physical entity that host there.\n\n143\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.740\nI can also communicate with\nthe host operating system.\n\n144\n00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.718\nSo maybe I'm running from\nmy host operating system.\n\n145\n00:07:50.718 --> 00:07:52.415\nManaging all these virtual machines.\n\n146\n00:07:52.415 --> 00:07:55.595\nTesting a new piece of software,\nseeing how that interacts and\n\n147\n00:07:55.595 --> 00:07:58.905\nhow they communicate with each other and\nwhat those results are.\n\n148\n00:07:58.905 --> 00:08:01.099\nAnd I have a good test pilot environment.\n\n149\n00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.259\nBefore I roll it out into production.\n\n150\n00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:06.830\nSo, internal would be good for that.\n\n151\n00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:12.300\nIt's communication between the virtual\nmachines on that physical entity and\n\n152\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.390\nthe host operating system\ncommunication there.\n\n153\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.060\nAnd then, lastly we have private and\n\n154\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.210\nagain private is good for\ntesting purposes as well.\n\n155\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.930\nMaybe you have specific\nscenarios where you\n\n156\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.600\ndo not want those virtual machines to\nbe able to communicate with that host.\n\n157\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.470\nSo, if we look at the description here it\njust says it creates a virtual switch that\n\n158\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:36.140\ncan be used only by the virtual machines\nthat run on this physical computer.\n\n159\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.420\nSo, we do see a bit more isolation and\n\n160\n00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.190\nspecifically Microsoft\nwill call out isolation.\n\n161\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.770\nWe'll look in the next episode,\nI think, or\n\n162\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.830\na little bit later other ways\nwe can implement isolation.\n\n163\n00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.480\nBut this is definitely one\nway we could do that here.\n\n164\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.920\n&gt;&gt; So, kind of even just to go\nin the list backwards, right?\n\n165\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.570\nThe last one you talked\nabout was the private.\n\n166\n00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.970\nSo, that would be VM to\nVM communication only.\n\n167\n00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.360\nCompletely isolated in Sandbox.\n\n168\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.860\nWe got the internal one,\nwhich is VM to host, we're kinda steering\n\n169\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.780\noutside of that bubble, cuz now, we could\npotentially affect the host as well.\n\n170\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.470\nAnd last, but not least like you said,\nwe've got not only VM to VM,\n\n171\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.700\nVM to host and VM to the physical Network,\nso VM the land if you will.\n\n172\n00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so, we do have those\ndifferent options there, and\n\n173\n00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.770\nit's simply for your preference and your\nchoice an like Wes had mentioned there.\n\n174\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.890\nLike, you know, is it going to be for\nsecurity purposes?\n\n175\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.610\nIs it going to be for testing purposes, or\n\n176\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.190\nsome other purpose that you that's\nspecific to your organization.\n\n177\n00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.110\nMaybe I am hosting cloud services,\n\n178\n00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.500\nand I wanna create a private network,\nso I can rent them out.\n\n179\n00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.460\nSo, maybe my clients don't want\nto have to worry about that\n\n180\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.110\nissue with security where\nthe host is maybe having\n\n181\n00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.830\ntoo much information about those\nindividual virtual machines.\n\n182\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.180\nSo, it really just depends on how\nyou wanna go ahead and set this up.\n\n183\n00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.380\nBut for this demonstration we'll go\nahead and stick here with private,\n\n184\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.890\nand we'll select this option\nhere to create a virtual switch.\n\n185\n00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.950\nAnd let's just name this one.\n\n186\n00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.380\nI think following along with\nthe lab if you are doing so,\n\n187\n00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.470\nthey want to name it PLAB-Private here.\n\n188\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.082\nSo, we'll do that.\n\n189\n00:10:17.727 --> 00:10:22.420\nI believe that's the one\nthey want us to name it.\n\n190\n00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.650\nAnyways, if not, it's not a big deal.\n\n191\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.390\nYou can easily change it, and I'll explain\nwhy it's important here in a moment,\n\n192\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.350\nactually right now.\n\n193\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.340\nBecause this is good for notes.\n\n194\n00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.790\nOkay, so\nnotes descriptions are always good.\n\n195\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.880\nBut when you're talking\nabout creating a switch, and\n\n196\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.300\nI encouraged you to think about how\na physical switch works, right.\n\n197\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.350\nSo, let's go back to this\ndiagram here real quick.\n\n198\n00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.120\nAnd, if I had this switch, right.\n\n199\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.280\nAnd I've got these three computers,\nand maybe this is a server, or\n\n200\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.170\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n201\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.830\nPlugged into the actual physical\nports on this physical switch.\n\n202\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.960\nIf I walked past and\nwas performing maintenance, or\n\n203\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.140\nI just unplugged this physical switch,\nwhat would happen to these devices, right?\n\n204\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.180\nThey're gonna be losing connectivity.\n\n205\n00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.470\nSo, that same logic applies here\nin our virtual environment.\n\n206\n00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.880\nSo, if I come back over here.\n\n207\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:25.210\nIt might be a good idea, if I just\nwere to type in server01, server02,\n\n208\n00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:30.280\nor whatever the names of your machines\nare here for documentation purposes.\n\n209\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.290\nBecause maybe I create this switch,\nand then Wes comes and\n\n210\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.760\nis performing some kind\nof maintenance on it.\n\n211\n00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:42.110\nHe may not know, and so he doesn't wanna\nmodify this particular switch in any way.\n\n212\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.050\nWithout knowing who he may be impacting,\nso.\n\n213\n00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.340\n&gt;&gt; You know, Cherokee,\n\n214\n00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.870\nI know one thing that becomes a limiting\nfactor on switches is port density, right?\n\n215\n00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.420\nWe always think, you know, gosh,\nI've got this switch, right?\n\n216\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.660\nOr I've got a blade, right?\n\n217\n00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.820\nThat we're putting switches,\nyou know, additional ports in.\n\n218\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.940\nEventually what happens\nis we run out of ports.\n\n219\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.860\nIs that something that we have?\n\n220\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.720\nDo we have that limitation\nin a virtualized switch,\n\n221\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.270\nwhere I have to worry\nabout that port density?\n\n222\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:10.110\n&gt;&gt; So, the cool thing about that Wes,\nis no, we don't have that.\n\n223\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.430\nWe have unlimited ports here.\n\n224\n00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.100\nI think our biggest limitation is always\ngoing to be falling back onto that\n\n225\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.620\nhardware.\n\n226\n00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.230\nSo, how many virtual machines\ncan that host actually support.\n\n227\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.410\n&gt;&gt; So, this is just like you've\ntold us in other episodes.\n\n228\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.292\nYou know, you have your I call\nthem the four horsemen right?\n\n229\n00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:24.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're the ones that always give\n\n230\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.580\nyou the problems, right?\n\n231\n00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.860\nThey could be beneficial, but then they\ncan always give you problems, right?\n\n232\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.820\nWe have our CPU,\nyou've got your hard drive.\n\n233\n00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.300\nYou've got your disk.\n\n234\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.850\nWell, now, networking is in the mix too.\n\n235\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.630\nSo, you're gonna be limited by whatever\nthe bandwidth of your network adapter is.\n\n236\n00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.900\nAs I stack on more virtual machines then\nwhere they're all getting a slice of\n\n237\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.280\nthe pie, just like we say with CPUs and\nmemory, right?\n\n238\n00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.920\nThe more of it you have, the less of it,\n\n239\n00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.050\nwell the less that you have\nto allocate to those VMs.\n\n240\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.110\nSo, while you don't have that\nport density limitation,\n\n241\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.555\nyou do have an overall\nresource limitation.\n\n242\n00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:53.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely.\n\n243\n00:12:53.335 --> 00:12:55.625\nThat's always gonna be something\nthat we have to think about.\n\n244\n00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:58.705\nI mean, we've talked about the pros\nof having virtualization, but\n\n245\n00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:01.605\nthere is going to be that drawback\nthere of, just like you would\n\n246\n00:13:01.605 --> 00:13:05.685\nif you had an individual dedicated machine\nfor each one of your servers there.\n\n247\n00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:10.545\nSo, yeah, until we [LAUGH] can\nfigure something else out.\n\n248\n00:13:10.545 --> 00:13:13.765\nI say we, but yeah, who knows what\nthe future will bring for us?\n\n249\n00:13:13.765 --> 00:13:15.610\nIt's kind of an exciting time.\n\n250\n00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.930\nAll right, let's take a look at\nsome of these other options here.\n\n251\n00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:23.880\nSo, here you can see some radio buttons,\n\n252\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.810\nI have currently in my\nprivate network is selected,\n\n253\n00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.040\nthat's the one we spoke about that\nwe're gonna be creating here.\n\n254\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.100\nBut I do wanna point out a couple things.\n\n255\n00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.460\nWe will delve a little bit more\ninto optimization performance,\n\n256\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.390\nperformance optimization, I think in\nthe next show, but this is where you would\n\n257\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.720\nconfigure some of these settings here\nwhile creating this individual switch.\n\n258\n00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.310\nSome things you can go back, and change\nthe name of the switch if you want to,\n\n259\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.620\nI said that was really easy to do,\nand we can see that.\n\n260\n00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.920\nSome things are not so\neasy to go back and change,\n\n261\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:04.912\none of those being enable single\nroute I/O virtualization SR-IOV.\n\n262\n00:14:04.912 --> 00:14:06.740\nIf you don't know what that is,\nthat's okay.\n\n263\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:10.740\nI'll explain that in the next show, so\nyou definitely wanna stay tuned for that.\n\n264\n00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.920\nBut I do wanna point out,\nwhile we're right here in this interface,\n\n265\n00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.790\nthat this is where you would enable that.\n\n266\n00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.320\nBecause this is gonna\nbe our one shot here.\n\n267\n00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.380\nWhen you're creating that switch,\nso if you don't leverage that now,\n\n268\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.510\nthen you're not gonna be able\nto go back and change that.\n\n269\n00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.580\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee one of the things that I do\nknow that we can also do with switches is,\n\n270\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.750\nwe have ways that rather than having\nto add additional switches to segment\n\n271\n00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.860\nthe network, one of the things that we can\ndo is kind of logically divide a switch.\n\n272\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.280\nProverbially it's like taking\na logical hacksaw to the switch and\n\n273\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.790\nwe can divide it up based on ports,\n\n274\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.930\nand we can create what are known as\nvirtual local area networks, or VLAN.\n\n275\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.180\nIs that something we have the capability\nto do here in hyper V as well?\n\n276\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.940\n&gt;&gt; So, that's exactly right, Wes.\n\n277\n00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.130\nWe do.\nAnd you know, I come back to this.\n\n278\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.190\nLet me pull up this little\ndiagram here again.\n\n279\n00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.220\nThis is just that regular physical switch.\n\n280\n00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.440\nAnd just like Wes was saying, hey, look.\n\n281\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.830\nI can logically divide that switch up and\n\n282\n00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.560\nsegment my workstations\naway from my servers.\n\n283\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.090\nSo, I can implement different\nlevels of security, or\n\n284\n00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.320\nwhatever kind of just\nincreased communication.\n\n285\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.946\nBecause I don't have to send out\nas many broadcast communications,\n\n286\n00:15:16.946 --> 00:15:20.266\nbecause these machines I'm\nbuilding up smaller tables here.\n\n287\n00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:21.940\nThey're communicating more often.\n\n288\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.280\nI seldomly ever, or\neven talk to this server.\n\n289\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.870\nWho knows what your reason may be to\ncreate that logical separation there at\n\n290\n00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:32.770\nlayer two, but you can take that idea,\nthat methodology and\n\n291\n00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.200\nbring it right into our\nvirtual environments as well.\n\n292\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.730\nAnd we see that here Wes right\nunder that setting here.\n\n293\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.090\nSo, for VLAN ID.\n\n294\n00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:43.128\nSo, this is another way that we\ncan implement isolation here.\n\n295\n00:15:43.128 --> 00:15:47.594\nNow, again, I can come back and\nchange this at this particular if I'm\n\n296\n00:15:47.594 --> 00:15:52.136\nimplementing it through all the way\ndown to the physical layer here, or\n\n297\n00:15:52.136 --> 00:15:57.229\nif I just want to have virtualization\nsegmentation, I can select that as well.\n\n298\n00:15:57.229 --> 00:15:59.365\nAnd, I can just change that virtual ID.\n\n299\n00:15:59.365 --> 00:16:03.157\nSo I can say by default they've\ngot two selected here, so\n\n300\n00:16:03.157 --> 00:16:07.818\nif I create my and ID two and\nspecify that only the machines with\n\n301\n00:16:07.818 --> 00:16:11.070\nthe number two here will\nbe able to communicate.\n\n302\n00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.660\nSo I am creating isolation there as well.\n\n303\n00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.570\nAnything else on this screen.\n\n304\n00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.140\nYeah, so there's one more thing that\nI didn't cover on this particular\n\n305\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.540\nscreen here,\n\n306\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.390\nis this allow management of the operating\nsystem to share this network adapter.\n\n307\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.335\nThis is something that just is pretty\nstraightforward, just like it sounds.\n\n308\n00:16:30.335 --> 00:16:34.860\nYou're allowing the actual\noperating system to have access\n\n309\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.970\nto this particular switch as well.\n\n310\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.120\nAnd then also from this drop down menu and\n\n311\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.800\nthis lab environment you only have\none physical network interface card.\n\n312\n00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.284\nIf you had multiple here this is where\nyou would select them from this drop\n\n313\n00:16:47.284 --> 00:16:48.029\ndown menu.\n\n314\n00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:51.980\nAnd I think that's about it for\njust configuring them.\n\n315\n00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.700\nSo it's pretty straight forward.\n\n316\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.468\nIt's not too difficult to do.\n\n317\n00:16:55.468 --> 00:17:00.353\nYou do have that notification down here\nabout the SRIOV only being able to\n\n318\n00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:04.320\nbe implemented or\nenabled here upon creation.\n\n319\n00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.180\nSo you would just go ahead and\nselect OK to generate that and\n\n320\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:14.510\nyou can actually see it listed here over\nin blue on the left hand side there.\n\n321\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.114\nAnd actually, since we are already on\nthe [LAUGH] left hand side over here,\n\n322\n00:17:17.114 --> 00:17:18.971\nthere's something that I\nwant to point out as well.\n\n323\n00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:21.760\nAnd this is going to be\nthe MAC address range.\n\n324\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.690\nSo if I wanted to for\nsome reason set that range,\n\n325\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.440\nthis is where I would go ahead and\ndo it on this switch side.\n\n326\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.830\nNow I also have the ability to\nconfigure that on the client side.\n\n327\n00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.530\nI'll show you that in a moment.\n\n328\n00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.610\nBut if I were to change this\nrange during production hours and\n\n329\n00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.610\nI already had machines that were up and\nrunning with a pre existing MAC addresses.\n\n330\n00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.070\nIt would not affect them.\n\n331\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.140\nI could go in there manually and\n\n332\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.370\nchange them but just knowing that\nthis is where that option is.\n\n333\n00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.710\nAnd why might I wanna do that.\n\n334\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.470\nWhy would I wanna change.\n\n335\n00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.720\nAnd this is what we were kind of\ntalking about before the show Wes.\n\n336\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.370\nIt's kind of strange\nif you think about it.\n\n337\n00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.258\nHow can I have a physical, what are some\nwords we use here for our cards for\n\n338\n00:18:05.258 --> 00:18:06.630\nour MAC addresses.\n\n339\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.163\n&gt;&gt; Burned in addresses is one I think.\n\n340\n00:18:07.163 --> 00:18:08.900\n&gt;&gt; Burned in addresses, yeah.\n\n341\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.057\nIt's not even there, so\n\n342\n00:18:10.057 --> 00:18:12.932\nhow can I burn it into something\nthat is not physically there.\n\n343\n00:18:12.932 --> 00:18:16.790\nAnd it's a little bit difficult\nwhen you think about it.\n\n344\n00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:21.680\nBut we're just kind of using\nthe software to generate this for.\n\n345\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.123\nAs in by default,\nit's set to automatically,\n\n346\n00:18:24.123 --> 00:18:27.432\ndynamically generate those MAC\naddresses here within Hyper V.\n\n347\n00:18:27.432 --> 00:18:33.730\nBut we can set it statically,\nif we need to for licensing issues.\n\n348\n00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:38.630\nIf I have specific pieces of\nsoftware that require a specific\n\n349\n00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.740\nMAC address there associated with\nan end user or with a machine.\n\n350\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.748\nAlso for firewall configurations,\njust a couple different reasons why I'd\n\n351\n00:18:47.748 --> 00:18:52.768\nwant to use the static MAC addresses or\nset them specifically manually here.\n\n352\n00:18:52.768 --> 00:18:56.640\n&gt;&gt; So you're bringing me back to my\nwhat is it, elementary networking here.\n\n353\n00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.760\nYou mention layer two in the beginning of\nthe episode talking about the switches\n\n354\n00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.885\noperated layer two and we know that\nMAC addresses are how switches.\n\n355\n00:19:03.885 --> 00:19:06.801\nI've figure out which port is\ninformation gonna pass there, so\n\n356\n00:19:06.801 --> 00:19:10.582\nthese are no different, even though we're\ntalking about virtual machines here.\n\n357\n00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:15.590\nAnd typically in a server you might have\nusually a minimum of two network adapters.\n\n358\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.980\nI know some of them can have one, but\n\n359\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.710\nusually for\nredundancy you have two network adapters.\n\n360\n00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:24.350\nBut if I've got 15 machines running on\na single host, then we do need a way\n\n361\n00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.470\nto uniquely identify those communications\nas they go over the land as well.\n\n362\n00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:32.230\nSo really what I'm saying here is\nthat these virtual MAC addresses\n\n363\n00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.180\nthey really operate no different then\nany other physical MAC address and\n\n364\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.870\nuniquely identify communications\nfrom the VM on that machine.\n\n365\n00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.330\n&gt;&gt; Sure and now.\n\n366\n00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.695\nWe'll take a look at this in a second\nI mean but that's exactly it Wes,\n\n367\n00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:47.689\nyou've got that they're a couple different\nways that we can implement the way that\n\n368\n00:19:47.689 --> 00:19:48.502\ntraffic flows.\n\n369\n00:19:48.502 --> 00:19:55.060\nBut just in our standard virtualization\nnetwork flow here, you're gonna be having.\n\n370\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.920\nLet's think about this.\n\n371\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.874\nWe've got our physical equipment,\nso coming into that physical.\n\n372\n00:19:59.874 --> 00:20:02.710\nWell, you've got your physical\nwhatever it is and then the cable.\n\n373\n00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.150\nOr You've got that physical\nnetwork interface, right?\n\n374\n00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.140\nAnd then you're coming into the machine.\n\n375\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.340\nAnd then from there,\nwe're gonna be accessing,\n\n376\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.710\nI just wanna make sure\nI'm saying this right.\n\n377\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.700\nSo the first thing you're gonna be\nhitting you've got that physical.\n\n378\n00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.450\nThe operating system hosting\nthat hypervisor there.\n\n379\n00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.692\nThe hypervisor will then hand\nthat off to the virtual switch,\n\n380\n00:20:21.692 --> 00:20:26.667\nand then that virtual switch will then\nhand that off to the VNIC on which is\n\n381\n00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:29.050\ninside of your virtual machines.\n\n382\n00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:33.499\nSo of you think about that logical flow\nthat virtual switches gonna be looking\n\n383\n00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:37.613\njust like Wes said at that frame\nthat Ethernet that's coming through.\n\n384\n00:20:37.613 --> 00:20:41.907\nAnd it's gonna say, okay,\nI'm either gonna use this MAC address or\n\n385\n00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:46.572\nI'm gonna be using this 802.1Q tag\nthat VLAN identifier field within\n\n386\n00:20:46.572 --> 00:20:50.298\nthat frame to push it to a specific\nVLAN if I have that set up.\n\n387\n00:20:50.298 --> 00:20:53.030\nOr just that MAC address so\nthe concept is the same.\n\n388\n00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.650\n&gt;&gt; And the MAC address range seems a lot\nlike another concept that I know we talk\n\n389\n00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.490\nabout in 7410 and\nyou have a DHCP scope right and\n\n390\n00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.320\nI have a certain range of IP addresses\nbased on how I configure the scope.\n\n391\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.065\nThat are gonna be passed out for\n\n392\n00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:09.964\nthe clients that send out\ntheir discovery packet.\n\n393\n00:21:09.964 --> 00:21:11.010\nAnd really I mean we're not.\n\n394\n00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.960\nIt's layer two not layer\nthree where IP addresses sit.\n\n395\n00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.830\nSo just to have to make\nsure I say that out there.\n\n396\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:19.860\nBut this is really just a pool of MAC\naddresses that this host machine is gonna\n\n397\n00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.370\nallocate to the VMs.\n\n398\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.830\nWhen they need to send communications\nto inform the virtual switch.\n\n399\n00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, essentially.\n\n400\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.485\nAnd so just kinda taking that knowledge\nthat you may already have there.\n\n401\n00:21:29.485 --> 00:21:33.611\nFrom Wes said, networking 101 and\nbring that in here concept still applies,\n\n402\n00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:36.901\na little bit different but\nthat's what we're looking at here.\n\n403\n00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:39.438\nAll right, so\nlet me just close out of here.\n\n404\n00:21:39.438 --> 00:21:43.680\nI do wanna show you where you would\nenable that on the actual machines.\n\n405\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.720\nSo I call both things to know.\n\n406\n00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.190\nLet me go ahead and let's connect to this\nmachine and just power it on real quick.\n\n407\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.480\nI wanna show you the difference here.\n\n408\n00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.490\nLet's just pick one of these and\ngo to Settings here.\n\n409\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.800\nAnd that is going to be under the adapter.\n\n410\n00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.940\nSo when I was walking through that\nlogical flow and I said, okay,\n\n411\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.700\nthe virtual machines have to have VNIC,\nso virtual network interface card,\n\n412\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.940\nso that is what this is right here.\n\n413\n00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.573\nThat private network adapter here,\nso if I go ahead and expand on this,\n\n414\n00:22:13.573 --> 00:22:15.748\nthis is my virtual machine PLAB.\n\n415\n00:22:15.748 --> 00:22:19.752\nLet me move this over so\nyou can see up here at the top,\n\n416\n00:22:19.752 --> 00:22:24.030\nPLABWIN802 that's the name\nof my virtual machine on\n\n417\n00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.405\nthe actual host operating\nsystem PLABHYPERV there.\n\n418\n00:22:28.405 --> 00:22:32.545\nAnd so if I expand this little plus,\nI know it's super tiny you might have to\n\n419\n00:22:32.545 --> 00:22:35.189\nsquint to see it over here\non the left hand side.\n\n420\n00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:40.307\nBut there's going to be a section\nhere called Advanced Features.\n\n421\n00:22:40.307 --> 00:22:45.467\nSo this is where I would actually set\nthat MAC address on the clients and\n\n422\n00:22:45.467 --> 00:22:48.207\nlike I said by default,\nit's set to Dynamic.\n\n423\n00:22:48.207 --> 00:22:52.307\nAlternatively, I could set it\nto Static and then certain\n\n424\n00:22:52.307 --> 00:22:57.490\nload balancing technologies may utilize\nthis MAC address spoofing options here.\n\n425\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.280\nBut they're really not gonna\nask you too much about that.\n\n426\n00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.080\nBut this is where that\nsetting would be noted.\n\n427\n00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.770\nLet me just hit Cancel for\nnow, the reason I wanted to\n\n428\n00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.858\nspin that other VM up is to show you the\ndifference between these settings options.\n\n429\n00:23:09.858 --> 00:23:17.491\nNow, that VMPLABWIN803 is in\nthe off state as you can see here.\n\n430\n00:23:17.491 --> 00:23:22.710\nNow this PLABDCO1 is running and\nI right click, go to Settings, and I\n\n431\n00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:29.470\ngo to my adapter over here, expand it out,\nand then go to those Advanced Features.\n\n432\n00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.440\nNotice how it's grayed out.\n\n433\n00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.720\nThat's going to be because\nthe machine is running.\n\n434\n00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.300\nSo I'm not able I mean,\nit kind of makes sense, right?\n\n435\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.630\nI'm not able to change that MAC\naddress while the machine's running.\n\n436\n00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.820\nA lot of settings here in 2012 are, too.\n\n437\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.570\nAnd moving forward,\n\n438\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:47.310\nyou are able to change while the system\nis up but not that MAC address here.\n\n439\n00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.349\nSo I just wanted to point that out.\n\n440\n00:23:49.349 --> 00:23:50.040\nAll right.\n\n441\n00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.687\nNow, we looked also at the enabling\nthe single root SRIOV.\n\n442\n00:23:55.687 --> 00:23:57.382\nWe'll look at that a little\nbit more in the next show.\n\n443\n00:23:57.382 --> 00:24:01.124\nI do wanna show you how to create\na switch also within PowerShell.\n\n444\n00:24:01.124 --> 00:24:06.860\nIn just about all of these concepts,\nwe like to look at it from both angles.\n\n445\n00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.510\nI have a link here, let's see.\n\n446\n00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:13.870\nSo this is going to be Microsoft\n\n447\n00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.980\ndocumentation on how to create just that\nsyntax I usually like to show you here.\n\n448\n00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.710\nWe have a lot of different options and\nparameters.\n\n449\n00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.060\nLet me just kinda skip\nthrough some of these and\n\n450\n00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.440\nlook at the more important ones,\nsuch as the required parameters.\n\n451\n00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.260\nSo obviously we're going to\nneed to provide a name for\n\n452\n00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.990\nthe switch that we're creating,\nthat's something that we need to have.\n\n453\n00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:42.400\nLet me skip this one right here and\ngo down a little bit further,\n\n454\n00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.210\nthat one too and let me go to this\none first, provide the switch type.\n\n455\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.090\nThe reason I'm saying that\nis because those other two\n\n456\n00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:53.590\nare contingent upon one particular\nsetting with the switch type.\n\n457\n00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.110\nSo if I offer up a parameter here,\n\n458\n00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:02.260\nI have the option to do a -SwitchType\neither internal or private.\n\n459\n00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:07.040\nAnd remember those are the two\noptions that do not bind to or\n\n460\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.510\ndo not require a dedicated\nnetwork interface.\n\n461\n00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:14.500\nPhysical network interface card for\nthat particular switch type.\n\n462\n00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:20.441\nWhereas with an external switch type,\nyou would need to piggyback on either,\n\n463\n00:25:20.441 --> 00:25:25.494\nthese are both of those two commandlets\nthat we kind of glaze over.\n\n464\n00:25:25.494 --> 00:25:28.533\nThey're right here but\nthey're just specifying, hey,\n\n465\n00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:32.140\nyou need to know the name of that\nparticular network interface card.\n\n466\n00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:36.366\nThe physical NIC that you're gonna be\nusing if you're creating an external and\n\n467\n00:25:36.366 --> 00:25:37.130\nPowerShell.\n\n468\n00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:40.440\nSo if you use the Get-NetAdapter cmdlet,\n\n469\n00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.590\nthen that's gonna show you what's listed\nthere in the actual physical host.\n\n470\n00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:49.000\nAnd then you can choose the correct name\nand pipe that into your syntax there.\n\n471\n00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.550\nAnd that's all I wanted to show you there.\n\n472\n00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.750\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n473\n00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.560\nPretty simple here.\n\n474\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.960\nIt's gonna be New-, this is going to be\nVMSwitch and we can just tab through.\n\n475\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.760\nAnd we'll give ours a name, whatever\nyou want to name it like DemoSwitch.\n\n476\n00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.005\nAnd I'm going to add my -SwitchType.\n\n477\n00:26:12.718 --> 00:26:14.710\nAnd let's just say Internal.\n\n478\n00:26:18.717 --> 00:26:21.790\nHit enter, we've created that switch type.\n\n479\n00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.220\nLet me just minimize this.\n\n480\n00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.128\nIf we go back to our\nVirtual Switch Manager here,\n\n481\n00:26:26.128 --> 00:26:29.710\nwe see DemoSwitch has been created there.\n\n482\n00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.640\nAnd like I said if I\nwanted to change this to,\n\n483\n00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:40.390\nmaybe I'll change it to ITProTV,\nif I can type.\n\n484\n00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.820\nTV switch, notice how in the left-hand\npane, that name automatically changed.\n\n485\n00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.400\nI can change that.\n\n486\n00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.810\nIf I were to switch it to an external and\nI were to bind it to my physical\n\n487\n00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:58.780\nnetwork interface card, notice how that\noption for my SR-IOV is grayed out.\n\n488\n00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.205\nLike we had talked about before,\n\n489\n00:27:00.205 --> 00:27:04.740\nwe're only gonna see that upon creation\nand I think that's about it for now.\n\n490\n00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.560\nThat's how you'd go ahead and\n\n491\n00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:10.670\ncreate a switch both in the graphical\nuser interface as well as in PowerShell.\n\n492\n00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.230\nA lot of great information there,\nCherokee.\n\n493\n00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.850\nAnd I know we're just\nscratching the surface, so\n\n494\n00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.290\nwe gotta come back in a part two.\n\n495\n00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:19.420\nBut does look like we are running to\nthe end of another great episode here.\n\n496\n00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.360\nWe're running out of time.\n\n497\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.331\nSo before we part ways,\ndo you have any additional options about\n\n498\n00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:25.430\ncreating the switch for\nthe very first time?\n\n499\n00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:32.150\nOr maybe making a recommendation on\nthe different switch types that we have.\n\n500\n00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.900\n&gt;&gt; I guess, just with everything,\nthink about it and plan ahead.\n\n501\n00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.090\nBecause if you don't plan ahead,\n\n502\n00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.970\nyou're just gonna be setting\nyourself up for failure.\n\n503\n00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.070\nAnd definitely keep track\nof that documentation.\n\n504\n00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.218\nIt's because here's another thing.\n\n505\n00:27:43.218 --> 00:27:48.440\nI didn't even show you here, but I will\npoint this out at the last minute here.\n\n506\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.983\nI mentioned you wanna keep a good track\nof what machines are associated with\n\n507\n00:27:52.983 --> 00:27:56.170\nthat particular switch,\nthose virtual machines.\n\n508\n00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:57.840\nBecause if I'm in\na production environment and\n\n509\n00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.826\na virtual machine's running that\nare attached to that switch.\n\n510\n00:28:00.826 --> 00:28:04.756\nAnd I said hey, would be similar to if\nwe walk past and unplug that switch in\n\n511\n00:28:04.756 --> 00:28:08.250\na physical environment, those machines\nwill lose connectivity and communication.\n\n512\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.900\nWell, in the virtual environment,\nif I were to try to delete, let me see,\n\n513\n00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.000\nI'm not sure how this is configured with\nthe ones that they had already set up.\n\n514\n00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.540\nBut if I wanted to remove,\nI just hit Remove right here.\n\n515\n00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.990\nIt may or may not allow me to.\n\n516\n00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.760\nOkay, so this one did without a problem.\n\n517\n00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.000\nBut if you ever get that notification\nthat says you're not able to remove this,\n\n518\n00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.800\nthat means you have machines that are\nrunning that are dependent on that switch.\n\n519\n00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.270\nSo you definitely want to\nkeep good documentation.\n\n520\n00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.274\nThat's why I recommend using\nthat note section there.\n\n521\n00:28:38.274 --> 00:28:42.112\nSo that you can, if you do have to remove\na switch, make sure you go through and\n\n522\n00:28:42.112 --> 00:28:46.370\nchange the configurations on all those\nvirtual machines before doing that.\n\n523\n00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, well,\nthat's a great place to stop.\n\n524\n00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.400\nWe appreciate you being here as always and\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n525\n00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.510\nWe're going to go ahead and sign out.\n\n526\n00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.189\nRemember you can watch this episode of\nthousands of hours of additional content\n\n527\n00:28:57.189 --> 00:28:59.130\nby jumping over to our course library.\n\n528\n00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.800\nBut until we see you again,\nI've been your show host Wes Bryan.\n\n529\n00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.450\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n530\n00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.193\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n531\n00:29:04.193 --> 00:29:10.228\n[MUSIC]\n\n532\n00:29:10.228 --> 00:29:13.313\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:08.487\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:10.820\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.540\n&gt;&gt; Hello to all our viewers out there.\n\n7\n00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.420\nThanks for tuning in.\n\n8\n00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.150\nWe got a great show in store for you.\n\n9\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.880\nThat's right,\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan, and\n\n10\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.790\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series on the 70-410 exam,\n\n11\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.080\nthat's right the MCSA in\nWindows Server 2012 R 2.\n\n12\n00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.900\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\n\n13\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.370\nPart 2 on Hyper-V Networking is none\nother than Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n14\n00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.310\nCherokee how are you doing today?\n\n15\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.580\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great thank you\nhaving me back Wes, how are you?\n\n16\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.200\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great,\n\n17\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.670\nin the fast part we got to look at some of\nthe different types of virtual switches.\n\n18\n00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.340\nWe learned that hey,\n\n19\n00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.950\nthese virtualized switches work no\ndifferent than any other physical switch.\n\n20\n00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.760\nAnd it really just depends on\nwhat type of communications\n\n21\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.570\nthat we really need on what\nswitch we will implement.\n\n22\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.860\nNow, we've got a little\nbit more to go over, so\n\n23\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.120\nthat's why we came back with a Part 2.\n\n24\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.350\nSo where do we start there Cherokee?\n\n25\n00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes, you brought up a really good\npoint because I did tell you that our\n\n26\n00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.080\nvirtual switches, they provided that same\nfunction, that layer two technology.\n\n27\n00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.330\nAnd they were a lot like our physical\nswitches, but there are some differences\n\n28\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.520\nin the way that that information,\nthat data, is being handled.\n\n29\n00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.550\nSo that's what we really\nlook at here starting off.\n\n30\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.360\nAnd specifically,\nMicrosoft calls out on their objectives,\n\n31\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.680\nwhat did they call it here,\noptimize network performance.\n\n32\n00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.030\nSo I think that's where we'll start.\n\n33\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.020\nWe'll look at some settings that\nwe have available to us to help\n\n34\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.780\nincrease the performance\nwhenever we're utilizing\n\n35\n00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.650\ndifferent types of hardware in\nconfiguring these switches.\n\n36\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.180\nSo if we take a look at my screen- screen,\n\n37\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.976\nnot scream,\nyou might want to scream sometimes.\n\n38\n00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.970\n[LAUGH] At least I do.\n\n39\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.922\nBut anyways,\nif we take a look at my screen here.\n\n40\n00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:39.606\nAll right, let me just zoom in so\nwe can take a look at this.\n\n41\n00:01:39.606 --> 00:01:43.975\nAnd if I click on one of my virtual\nmachines here and go under the settings.\n\n42\n00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:48.202\nNow, what I'm specifically gonna be\nlooking at here are the actual adapter\n\n43\n00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:51.460\nconfigurations and\nwe saw this in the last episode.\n\n44\n00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.140\nIf you weren't able to catch that then\nyou definitely want to go back and just\n\n45\n00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.050\nfamiliarize yourself with the way that\nthose adapters work with our switches.\n\n46\n00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.910\nSo here if I expand my network adapter\nout over on the left hand side,\n\n47\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.720\nand I click on Hardware Acceleration,\n\n48\n00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.090\nthis is where I'm gonna find those\noptimization configuration options.\n\n49\n00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.730\nSo we'll take a look here in this show\nat the different options that we have\n\n50\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.270\navailable to us.\n\n51\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.020\nBut first I think, before we start\nlooking at the virtual machine queue,\n\n52\n00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.810\nand the IPsec task offloading, as well as\nSROIV options, I know it's kind of small.\n\n53\n00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.050\nBut we will come back and\n\n54\n00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.640\nwe'll talk about each one of these\nlittle tick boxes here individually.\n\n55\n00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.030\nI think we should really make sure we\nunderstand just the basic fundamental way\n\n56\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.970\nthat this traffic flows through\nour virtual machines here.\n\n57\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.680\nSo let me pull up,\nI've got something here for us,\n\n58\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.060\nthat is going to be on my simple diagram,\nand this is just a basic diagram.\n\n59\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.850\nNow, without getting down into\nthe electrical components and\n\n60\n00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.640\nreally specific details here,\nwhich you can.\n\n61\n00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.250\nI just wanted to give at least\na high level overview so\n\n62\n00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.040\nyou can understand what's happening\nhere in this environment.\n\n63\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.511\nSo, you guys have to get a little bit\ncreative with me, Wes, that means you too.\n\n64\n00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:15.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, we have some bubbles here and\n\n65\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.800\nthese bubbles are going to be\nrepresenting different types of packets.\n\n66\n00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.620\nSo communication that's destined for\ncertain VMs,\n\n67\n00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.790\nvirtual machines,\non my local area network here.\n\n68\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.430\nNow this could either be a different\nportion, this could be my LAN,\n\n69\n00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.180\nthis could be coming externally.\n\n70\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.430\nThis is just wherever that\ndata is originating from and\n\n71\n00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.040\nI had that incoming ingress data.\n\n72\n00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.990\nAnd that's what we're specifically looking\nat here, just to get this point across.\n\n73\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.750\nBut I wanted to show the different\nsteps that these packets have to\n\n74\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.870\ngo through in order to actually\nreach that final destination.\n\n75\n00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.930\nSo, we were talking about this\na little bit in the last show,\n\n76\n00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.560\nthose packets come through that\nphysical network interface.\n\n77\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.130\nFrom the physical network interface,\n\n78\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.380\nit's gonna pass it on off to\nthe Virtual Machine Manager.\n\n79\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.210\nSpecifically with Microsoft,\nwere looking at Hyper-V here so\n\n80\n00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.720\nthat Hypervisor is handling that.\n\n81\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.220\nAnd it will then offload those\npackets to the virtual switch.\n\n82\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.100\nThat virtual switch will then look at\nthat individual ethernet frame and\n\n83\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.170\nwill say hey, this is either going to be\nsorted by MAC address or VLAN tag there.\n\n84\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.470\nAnd will push that particular frame,\nthat data, to the destination.\n\n85\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.340\nNow once it gets to the actual virtual\nmachine we saw, we just looked,\n\n86\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.840\nwe were just in our adapter settings.\n\n87\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.450\nSo there is a VNIC, a virtual adapter, for\nthat individual virtual machine there.\n\n88\n00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.090\nSo that virtual machine\nalso has a virtual adapter.\n\n89\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.720\nSo it sounds like a lot to get\nthrough that virtual machine.\n\n90\n00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.900\nAnd it is we're utilizing that software so\nyou do see some performance declaration.\n\n91\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.860\nAnd if you were to do like a side by\nside comparison with just a straight\n\n92\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.400\npiece of hardware flowing, you know,\nthat data flowing through there.\n\n93\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.870\nSo that's what we're\nkind of looking at here.\n\n94\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.330\nNow let's take a look at what\nthat actually looks like and\n\n95\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.430\nhow that's being processed.\n\n96\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.527\nSo bear with me here, I've got a couple\ndifferent virtual machines all right.\n\n97\n00:05:17.527 --> 00:05:20.605\nAll right, virtual machine, hmm,\nwhere are we gonna have room for\n\n98\n00:05:20.605 --> 00:05:22.120\nall our virtual machines, Wes?\n\n99\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.920\n&gt;&gt; Have to move them to the side.\n\n100\n00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.828\nThese are virtual machines.\n\n102\n00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:33.230\nAll right, so\nlet's say that I am that hypervisor,\n\n103\n00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.340\nand I'm gonna be processing and handling\nthose packets off to my virtual switch.\n\n104\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.780\nSo Wes, I might need you to\nhelp me a little bit here, and\n\n105\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.380\nyou can help provide those packets.\n\n106\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.770\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; So maybe you want to send me some\n\n107\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.980\ninformation, that would be great.\n\n108\n00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.800\n&gt;&gt; I can do that, okay.\n\n109\n00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.990\nSo I'm gonna send you\nwhichever ones you want.\n\n110\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm getting a packet, and\nso that one will go into my VM one.\n\n111\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, perfect.\n\n112\n00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.570\n&gt;&gt; All right yellow, yellow.\n\n113\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.630\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n114\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, so this isn't too bad.\n\n115\n00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.230\nI'm able to process this information and\nI think things are going pretty well.\n\n116\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.080\nBut what happens, let's say this is maybe\none gigabit per second worth of flow.\n\n117\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.640\nAnd I can handle these,\ngetting spicy here with two of them, but\n\n118\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.890\nokay I can handle it right.\n\n119\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.900\nAnd let's just say I'm going through and\n\n120\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.790\nthat's the, I'm acting as all of those\ncomponents that we just spoke about.\n\n121\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.360\nSo I'm the software, oops almost\nput it in the pink bucket there.\n\n122\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.790\nNow Wes, what do you think would happen if\nthis was one gigabits worth of traffic,\n\n123\n00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.140\nand I was able to process it.\n\n124\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.970\nBut what if we're talking about\nan influx in that traffic, and\n\n125\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.190\nwe were looking at something\nlike ten gigabytes per second?\n\n126\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, I have an idea,\nit's gonna look something like this.\n\n127\n00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe?\n\n128\n00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that doesn't really seem\nlike the best network optimization.\n\n129\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.110\nSo If there were only something\nwe can do to help prevent that.\n\n130\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.590\nLet's take a look at my screen and\nI'll show you how.\n\n131\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.330\nSo this was that traditional\nvirtual ethernet traffic and\n\n132\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.570\nwe saw what could happen there.\n\n133\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.820\nBut moving forward,\nif we take a look at our VMDq,\n\n134\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.810\nthis is what we have, that's short for\nvirtual machine device queue.\n\n135\n00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.775\nNow, Intel was working heavily\non this technology, and\n\n136\n00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:19.550\nt's kind of interesting\nif you think about it,\n\n137\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.630\nthe same process initiates here\nwith those incoming packets.\n\n138\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.050\nBut there's going to be\na layer two sorter and\n\n139\n00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.300\nclassifier that looks at that information,\nwell to sort and classify it.\n\n140\n00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.170\nInstead of that virtual switch there\nto kind of offload that computing and\n\n141\n00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.440\nthat processing to help bypass\nthose software components.\n\n142\n00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.740\nAnd then just guide them directly\nto those virtual machines.\n\n143\n00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.320\nSo that's virtual machine device queues,\nbut they felt they could do better.\n\n144\n00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.910\nThere was something a little bit\ndifferent, a different technology here.\n\n145\n00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.493\nAnd moving forward,\nlet's see what that looks like.\n\n146\n00:07:57.493 --> 00:08:01.149\nThis is something called\nSingle Root I/O Virtualization,\n\n147\n00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:04.742\nfor inputs in our outputs here,\nfor that network traffic.\n\n148\n00:08:04.742 --> 00:08:08.072\nA lot of times we'll\njust hear it as SR I/OV.\n\n149\n00:08:08.072 --> 00:08:13.540\nAnd what happens here is instead of\nrelying on that layer two sorter and\n\n150\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:20.560\nclassifier, we're actually creating\ndedicated channels for those interrupts.\n\n151\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.680\nSo before, at the traditional methodology,\n\n152\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.100\nwe just had one particular\ncore handling and servicing\n\n153\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.190\nall of those individual interrupts for\nthose packets to transmissions.\n\n154\n00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:39.350\nSo what we see here is dedicated channels\nfor each one of those virtual machines.\n\n155\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.463\nAnd at that silicon layer,\nat the actual physical NIC,\n\n156\n00:08:43.463 --> 00:08:48.451\nthe chipset there is able to perform\nthat sorting, if you will, and\n\n157\n00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:52.234\nthen guide that data along\nthose dedicated paths.\n\n158\n00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:56.789\nAnd then those are through something,\nwe'll hear this terminology VF for\n\n159\n00:08:56.789 --> 00:08:58.350\nvirtual functions.\n\n160\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:04.160\nSo the virtual functions assist that flow\nand then allow for DMA, for our direct\n\n161\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.510\nmemory access here to be utilized to\nreserve that space in the physical memory.\n\n162\n00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.150\nSo we do see performance.\n\n163\n00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.694\nWe're bypassing that software.\n\n164\n00:09:13.694 --> 00:09:17.660\nSingle root input output virtualization\nis going to be a preferred method, but\n\n165\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.400\nit might not always be available.\n\n166\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.806\n&gt;&gt; And that's one of the things\nI was gonna touch on.\n\n167\n00:09:21.806 --> 00:09:25.025\nIn the last episode where we,\nthe first part, I should say,\n\n168\n00:09:25.025 --> 00:09:26.690\nof this Hyper-V networking.\n\n169\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.950\nYou said be very careful and\nmindful of the switches and\n\n170\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.419\nthe configurations when you\nbring those switches online.\n\n171\n00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:35.117\nCuz this is one that if you wanna\nutilize it, it has to be turned on\n\n172\n00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:39.520\nat the time that you create the switch,\nand there's no going back, right?\n\n173\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.830\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and if you think about it,\nthe motherboard,\n\n174\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.340\nthe hypervisor,\nthe virtualization solution, and\n\n175\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.580\nthe network interface card all\nhave to support this technology.\n\n176\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.646\nSo it's something you should definitely\nthink about when you're going to,\n\n177\n00:09:54.646 --> 00:09:58.585\nit's not as easy to change and\nmodify those configurations, because what\n\n178\n00:09:58.585 --> 00:10:02.850\nif you're modifying them to an adapter or\na machine that doesn't support that?\n\n179\n00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.006\nSo you would see that\nperformance degradation, and\n\n180\n00:10:05.006 --> 00:10:08.220\nthat's not something you\nwould typically want to have.\n\n181\n00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.270\nSo it's just an additional consideration\nbasically that you need to think about.\n\n182\n00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.200\nAnd if we look at my screen here,\nlet me go back to that machine.\n\n183\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.680\nThis is where you would go ahead and\nmodify those on a per-machine basis here.\n\n184\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.270\nAnd like you had said Wes, we need\nto think about that from the onset.\n\n185\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.255\nAnd make sure that we enable it at\nthat switch, the virtual switch level,\n\n186\n00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:32.002\nto be able to actually take advantage\nof it on the machine level here.\n\n187\n00:10:32.002 --> 00:10:36.070\nSo here we see that virtual machine queue.\n\n188\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.150\nAnd we can just go ahead and check or\n\n189\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.310\nuncheck that to require physical network\nadapter that supports this feature.\n\n190\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.959\nAnd then here we have that\nsingle root I OV, excuse me.\n\n191\n00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:52.420\nNow there's another one here, this is\ncalled, let me just zoom in a little bit.\n\n192\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.851\nAnd we can see IPsec task offloading,\nso when it comes to security,\n\n193\n00:10:57.851 --> 00:11:02.344\nand let me just pull up\nan actual page referencing this.\n\n194\n00:11:02.344 --> 00:11:06.400\nAnd we think about cryptography and\nwe think about that encryption.\n\n195\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.185\nAnd you always hear,\nwe need to have higher bit keys and\n\n196\n00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:12.240\nincrease that security.\n\n197\n00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.350\nWell with that additional security,\nit's kind of a bit of a trade-off.\n\n198\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.205\nWe might be forfeiting some\nof our performance for\n\n199\n00:11:20.205 --> 00:11:25.300\nthat CPU to be able to perform\nthose calculations decrypting.\n\n200\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.350\nAnd that can be a little\ntaxing on our CPU.\n\n201\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.730\nSo what we're looking at here with IPsec\ntask offloading is the ability to allow\n\n202\n00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:39.350\nthe network interface card to perform some\nof those decryption functions for us here.\n\n203\n00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.270\nAnd again, this is contingent upon\nif your hardware supports that.\n\n204\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.380\nSo I provided this link in the notes for\nyou, and\n\n205\n00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.350\nyou can just follow these\nsteps here actually.\n\n206\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.490\nWe can check on my machine to see\nif my particular adapter would\n\n207\n00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.610\nsupport this functionality.\n\n208\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.100\nIt's pretty simple here.\n\n209\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.308\nIf I just right-click on my Start key,\nI'm gonna select Run, and\n\n210\n00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:00.924\nI'm running Windows 10 here.\n\n211\n00:12:00.924 --> 00:12:04.240\nBut if you were on a server,\nyou would just pull up device manager.\n\n212\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.060\nAnd if you wanted to use the run line, you\ncould just type in, I have devmgmt.msc,\n\n213\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.710\nthat's the shortcut there,\nand we'll hit OK.\n\n214\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.160\nAnd I'll zoom in a little\nbit if I can here.\n\n215\n00:12:21.087 --> 00:12:22.450\nGive it a second, all right.\n\n216\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.280\nSo what I've done is just expanded\nout my network adapters here.\n\n217\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.384\nAnd the physical network adapter card\nin my system here is going to be\n\n218\n00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:32.977\nIntel Ethernet Connection, right here.\n\n219\n00:12:32.977 --> 00:12:37.469\nSo if you just double click or pull up\nthe properties for that particular device,\n\n220\n00:12:37.469 --> 00:12:39.000\nthere's going to be a tab.\n\n221\n00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.550\nLet me zoom out a little bit,\nso we can see that.\n\n222\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.600\nThe Advanced tab is what we're looking for\nhere.\n\n223\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.828\nAnd the specific term that you're\nlooking for is called IP offload V2.\n\n224\n00:12:50.828 --> 00:12:54.610\nOr that's the configuration that you\nwanna verify that your system is running.\n\n225\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.474\nSo if I pull that back up, and\nwhere did my little window go here?\n\n226\n00:12:58.474 --> 00:13:01.110\nI'm just gonna double click that again.\n\n227\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.760\nLooking at this list,\nI know it's real small for you guys,\n\n228\n00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.700\nbut I don't have that function here\non my particular machine, all right?\n\n229\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.510\nSo for me, it wouldn't be a viable option.\n\n230\n00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.040\nThis is a workstation here,\nan end user system.\n\n231\n00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.949\nSo if you wanted to\ntake advantage of that,\n\n232\n00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:19.960\nthat's something that you would check for\nin your network interface card as well.\n\n233\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.340\nBut just knowing that you do\nhave a supporting documentation.\n\n234\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.380\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ncancel out of that.\n\n235\n00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.022\nAnd if your network interface\ncard did support it,\n\n236\n00:13:28.022 --> 00:13:32.022\nthen this documentation shows you how\nyou could go ahead and enable it there.\n\n237\n00:13:32.022 --> 00:13:33.095\n&gt;&gt; And that's nice feature to have too.\n\n238\n00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:36.410\nI mean it's one of the reasons we have\nthings like VPN concentrators, right?\n\n239\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.577\nBecause I might have a connectivity\ndevice that supports VPN communication\n\n240\n00:13:40.577 --> 00:13:41.885\nlike L2TP with IPsec.\n\n241\n00:13:41.885 --> 00:13:45.646\nAnd that's good for a single connection,\nbut as you start stacking on additional\n\n242\n00:13:45.646 --> 00:13:48.110\nVPN communications like you had mentioned,\nright?\n\n243\n00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.652\nThat encryption and decryption of every\npacket that's coming through that tunnel\n\n244\n00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:53.455\ncan get very, very hardware intensive.\n\n245\n00:13:53.455 --> 00:13:56.530\nIt's one of the reasons we have things\nlike SSL aggregators built into your\n\n246\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.570\nservers, right?\n\n247\n00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.620\nWe have things like TCP offload engines,\n\n248\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.080\nbecause of maintaining the connections,\nright?\n\n249\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.280\nResending and retransmitting information.\n\n250\n00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.432\nFor a single network adapter in a single\nmachine, it might be just fine.\n\n251\n00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:14.137\nBut you start adding 15, 50, 100 of these\nadditional VMs on a single machine,\n\n252\n00:14:14.137 --> 00:14:17.874\nand you can see where the network\nperformance is just gonna basically\n\n253\n00:14:17.874 --> 00:14:19.810\ndrop off to nothing.\n\n254\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.940\n&gt;&gt; Exactly Wes, and so instead of\nforfeiting some of that performance,\n\n255\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.820\nalternatively you could forfeit some\nof that money in order to maintain that\n\n256\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.840\nperformance and that security.\n\n257\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.845\nIt's just kind of a trade off in some way.\n\n258\n00:14:31.845 --> 00:14:37.560\nUsually it's either security, cost,\nor performance there, but good point.\n\n259\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.351\nNow, I think that's about it for\nour performance optimization.\n\n260\n00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:43.284\nThere's something else I\ndid wanna note though, and\n\n261\n00:14:43.284 --> 00:14:45.930\nthat is going to be additional isolation.\n\n262\n00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.930\nSo in the last show,\nwe looked at ways we can isolate.\n\n263\n00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.485\nWes, what did we do?\n\n264\n00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:51.900\nWe looked at Mac addresses.\n\n265\n00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.140\nWe talked about VLANs.\n\n266\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.500\nAnd of course,\nyou have your traditional subnetting,\n\n267\n00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.050\nif you wanted to implement that.\n\n268\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.170\nBut there's still one more thing that\nwe can do here within our virtualized\n\n269\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.170\nenvironments.\n\n270\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.698\nLet me just pull up PowerShell.\n\n271\n00:15:04.698 --> 00:15:10.505\nAnd I may have to just make it\na little bit bigger for us here.\n\n272\n00:15:10.505 --> 00:15:14.780\nI did not do that yet, give me one second.\n\n273\n00:15:18.732 --> 00:15:21.852\nAnd we'll just change the text as well.\n\n274\n00:15:21.852 --> 00:15:26.560\nAll right, so here I am,\nI'm on PowerShell.\n\n275\n00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.584\nI just pulled up an administrative\nPowerShell prompt, and\n\n276\n00:15:29.584 --> 00:15:31.158\nI just did a change directory.\n\n277\n00:15:31.158 --> 00:15:34.520\nSorry, I did not do that yet, here I can.\n\n278\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:40.220\nJust to kind of shorten that prompt there,\nand I'll do cls to clear my screen.\n\n279\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:46.980\nAnd what we're gonna be doing here\nis implicitly denying communications\n\n280\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:52.160\nfrom certain IP addresses to\na particular machine on my network here.\n\n281\n00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:59.530\nSo the first thing I wanna do is\njust type in Get-VMNetworkAdapter.\n\n282\n00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.853\nIf I can type here, whoo.\n\n283\n00:16:02.853 --> 00:16:04.391\nAnd tab on through.\n\n284\n00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:08.025\nAnd I have to specify\nthe particular virtual machine,\n\n285\n00:16:08.025 --> 00:16:12.611\nso I'm gonna say VMName, and\nwe'll go ahead and type through that.\n\n286\n00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:16.601\nAnd for this particular demo,\nlet's just go ahead and\n\n287\n00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:21.127\ncheck the adaptors that\nare associated with PLABWIN802.\n\n288\n00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:28.070\nAll right, so, here I can see some\ninformation that maybe helpful whenever\n\n289\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.230\nI'm just writing this commands.\n\n290\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.170\nSo I have network adapter\nversus legacy adapter.\n\n291\n00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.750\nNow we'll talk about that in a moment\nas well and what those differences are.\n\n292\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:44.110\nYou can also see is the management\noperating system enabled?\n\n293\n00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.870\nWe saw that before in the GUI whenever\nwe were creating the switches.\n\n294\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.570\nTo allow that to operating system,\n\n295\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.580\nthe management operating\nsystem to be using it as well.\n\n296\n00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.470\nWe see the virtual machine name.\n\n297\n00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.600\nThe switch type if it's private,\nexternal, internal.\n\n298\n00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.484\nMAC address status and IP address as\nif we were to sign those as well.\n\n299\n00:17:03.484 --> 00:17:04.020\nAll right.\nSo\n\n300\n00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.290\nwhat we wanna do now is we're\ngonna ahead and set an ACL.\n\n301\n00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:14.414\nAn Access Control List to the particular\nadapter for our machine for PLABWIN802.\n\n302\n00:17:14.414 --> 00:17:23.340\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use\nAdd-VMNetwork not adapter but Acl.\n\n303\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.467\nAnd I still need to\nspecify that VMName here.\n\n304\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:33.156\nThe VMName,\nagain this is going to be our PLABWIN802.\n\n305\n00:17:33.156 --> 00:17:39.840\nAnd I'm gonna specify the RemoteIPAddress.\n\n306\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.450\nAnd what we're saying here is,\nwhat IP address do we want to be blocking?\n\n307\n00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.395\nSo for this demo let's see,\n\n308\n00:17:48.395 --> 00:17:53.195\nthis is going to be 192.168.0.1.\n\n309\n00:17:53.195 --> 00:17:56.976\nSo you would have to have some kind of\na reason as to why you would want to be\n\n310\n00:17:56.976 --> 00:17:57.680\ndoing this.\n\n311\n00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.520\nYou wouldn't want to do this just\nrandomly to impede that communication.\n\n312\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.860\nMaybe you had an attack coming\nfrom a specific IP address or\n\n313\n00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.020\nsomething to that nature.\n\n314\n00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.870\nSo I'm going to specify that IP address,\n\n315\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.670\nnow I also need to think about\nmy ingress and egress traffic.\n\n316\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.750\nSo I can specify a parameter to say\nwhat direction do I wanna block that.\n\n317\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.340\nSo here I'm gonna say direction.\n\n318\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.880\nAnd this direction is going to be Both.\n\n319\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:28.748\nAnd I can't remember if there's\na space there but we're gonna say for\n\n320\n00:18:28.748 --> 00:18:31.196\nthis Action this is going to be Deny.\n\n321\n00:18:31.196 --> 00:18:34.102\nSo we're gonna be denying incoming and\n\n322\n00:18:34.102 --> 00:18:39.570\noutgoing traffic from that particular\nIP address to our PLABWIN 801.\n\n323\n00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.390\nNothing major happened here.\n\n324\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.710\nI'm not really sure if it worked.\n\n325\n00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.520\nBut let's try to go ahead and\nblock from one more IP address.\n\n326\n00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.416\nI'm just gonna filter back and\nchange that last octet there.\n\n327\n00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:53.170\nWe'll change that from a 1 to a 3.\n\n328\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.310\nWe'll hit Enter.\n\n329\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.450\nAnd again not a lot of notifications.\n\n330\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.976\nSo one way we can check this is to use\n\n331\n00:19:01.976 --> 00:19:06.982\nthe Get-VMNetwork not adapter Acl.\n\n332\n00:19:06.982 --> 00:19:09.920\nAnd then we'll specify again that VMName.\n\n333\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:16.396\nAll right, I'll just tab one through\n\n334\n00:19:16.396 --> 00:19:20.665\nthat for our PLABWIN802.\n\n335\n00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:22.483\nEnter.\n\n336\n00:19:22.483 --> 00:19:26.410\nSo what we see here is going to\nbe the access control list for\n\n337\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:31.000\nthat particular virtual machine adapter,\nI should specify here.\n\n338\n00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.670\nSo we see that inbound and\noutbound communication for\n\n339\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:39.200\nour specific IP addresses here and\nyou can see in the far right hand column.\n\n340\n00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.730\nWe do have that deny action, so\nthat's an additional way to isolate.\n\n341\n00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:47.060\nAnd that is important because you know\nspecifically Microsoft does call out\n\n342\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.320\nisolation techniques for that exam.\n\n343\n00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.630\nLooking at the clock I see we have\nabout five minutes or so left, so\n\n344\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.190\nI do wanna take a look at one more thing.\n\n345\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.630\nLet me just minimize PowerShell here.\n\n346\n00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.190\nYou know we've talked about\na lot of different concepts.\n\n347\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:06.603\nWe've looked at our switches, we've seen\nhow to create virtual adapters here,\n\n348\n00:20:06.603 --> 00:20:11.440\nbut let's see, I think I have\nall gen one machines right here.\n\n349\n00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.010\nSo let's do something real quick.\n\n350\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.680\nLet's just create a gen\ntwo machine [COUGH].\n\n351\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:22.330\nLet's see, so actions here what am I doing\nnew, I'm just going to go over here.\n\n352\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.190\nVirtual machine and\nlet's go through that wizard.\n\n353\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.990\nI'll be real quick.\n\n354\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.770\nWe've already seen this.\n\n355\n00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:34.720\nI'm just going to name this Demo2 and\nchange this to a gen two machine.\n\n356\n00:20:35.745 --> 00:20:37.400\nAnd go through all the defaults.\n\n357\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.370\nWe don't need a ton of memory.\n\n358\n00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.900\nWe're not gonna spin it up.\n\n359\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:45.550\nWe'll just throw it right on to our\nprivate network and finish that.\n\n360\n00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.760\nAll I really wanna show you is\nthe difference between the settings here.\n\n361\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.190\nSo for our demo too if I right click and\ngo to Settings.\n\n362\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:59.014\nNotice on my Ad Hardware option,\nthat default option that comes up.\n\n363\n00:20:59.014 --> 00:21:00.780\nLet me move this over so\nwe can see it a little better.\n\n364\n00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:07.536\nI have Scuzzy Controller, Network Adapter,\nand a Fiber Channel Adapter.\n\n365\n00:21:07.536 --> 00:21:12.590\nAll right,\nnow I don't have a legacy adapter.\n\n366\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:17.700\nAll right this is just a limitation\nof our gent two machines,\n\n367\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.480\nI'm not able to create a legacy adapter,\nall right?\n\n368\n00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.410\nIf I wanted to have a legacy adapter\nusually the biggest reason I\n\n369\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:28.230\nwould opt to have one is if I\nwanted to utilize PXE boot.\n\n370\n00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.534\nGen two machines can PXE boot with\njust a regular network adapter, but\n\n371\n00:21:33.534 --> 00:21:36.360\nif I had a gen one machine and\nlet's see here.\n\n372\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.177\nAny one of these other machines\nare gonna be gen one's.\n\n373\n00:21:39.177 --> 00:21:41.040\nAnd we'll just go to\nthey're Settings here.\n\n374\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.790\nAnd notice here, I have the ability\nto create a Network Adapter,\n\n375\n00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.280\nas well as a Legacy Network Adapter.\n\n376\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.000\nSo, if I'm running a generation one\nmachine and I wanna utilize PXE boot,\n\n377\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.240\nthis is the option that I would select\nhere, is the Legacy Network Adapter.\n\n378\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.141\nSo that's kind of an important\nagain from the exam respective,\n\n379\n00:22:03.141 --> 00:22:07.261\njust looking at the differences\nthere between a regular adapter and\n\n380\n00:22:07.261 --> 00:22:10.749\na legacy adapter,\nis to be able to utilize that PXE boot.\n\n381\n00:22:10.749 --> 00:22:15.283\nSo if you wanted to do that boot strapped\ninstall operating systems or if you're\n\n382\n00:22:15.283 --> 00:22:19.772\nusing thin clients, then that's something\nin a gen one machine just to note.\n\n383\n00:22:19.772 --> 00:22:22.880\n&gt;&gt; All right, that's a lot of great\ninformation there Cherokee and\n\n384\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.748\nwe do appreciate as always you\nstopping by and letting us know,\n\n385\n00:22:25.748 --> 00:22:29.870\nit does look like you mentioned that\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n386\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.190\nSo that's a great stopping point.\n\n387\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.800\nWe appreciate you being here.\n\n388\n00:22:32.800 -->

Fransisco.\n\n3\n00:00:04.993 --> 00:00:07.153\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:08.559\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.224\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.224 --> 00:00:14.360\n&gt;&gt; Hello to all our viewers out there,\nthanks for tuning in,\n\n7\n00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.200\nwe got a great show in store for\nyou today.\n\n8\n00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.853\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan, and\n\n9\n00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:21.680\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series in the 7410 exam.\n\n10\n00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.118\nThat's right the MSCA and\nWindows Server 2012 and\n\n11\n00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:27.520\njoining us back in the studios today\nis none other than Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n12\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.510\nCherokee how are you doing today?\n\n13\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.570\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing excellent thank you for\nasking Wes, how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.886\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great over the past couple of\nepisodes we've been talking about Hyper V\n\n15\n00:00:33.886 --> 00:00:36.880\nnetworking and some of the the features\nand components that you'll see.\n\n16\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.500\nRemember this is a part three so if you've\nmissed one and two, you might have to\n\n17\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.281\njump back and watch those and\nthen join us back in the third part.\n\n18\n00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:48.070\nBut we didn't cover everything\nin the first two parts,\n\n19\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.100\nso yes we're back here with part three.\n\n20\n00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.155\nWhere are we gonna start Cherokee?\n\n21\n00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:54.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Actually that's a great place\nto start Wes because if we think about\n\n22\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.030\nwhere we left off in that prior episode,\n\n23\n00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.660\nwe were talking about virtual machine\nadapters and we had created a few.\n\n24\n00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.026\nWe were also talking about ways that we\ncan optimize that network traffic and\n\n25\n00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:10.461\ndifferent configurations settings that\nwe could leverage such as SR-IOV to\n\n26\n00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:13.479\nincrease and\nperform that hard work acceleration.\n\n27\n00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.286\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\n\n28\n00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:18.478\nI'd like to show you a few other\nthings that we can do to just make\n\n29\n00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.933\nour networks a little bit better\nin this virtualized environment.\n\n30\n00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.111\nAll right, so first,\nif you recall, just as a recap,\n\n31\n00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:29.200\nwe did point out the differences\nbetween Gen one and Gen two machines.\n\n32\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.070\nIt's very important to know that.\n\n33\n00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.660\nRemember with our Gen one machines we\nwould see, have the ability to create\n\n34\n00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.075\ntwo different type of network adapters,\njust a regular network adapter and\n\n35\n00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:45.200\nthen also a legacy adapter for enabling\nPxe boot on those Gen one machines.\n\n36\n00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.470\nAnd then when we solve Gen2.\n\n37\n00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.755\nWe only solve that network\nadapter option because Gen2\n\n38\n00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:55.494\nmachines had developed and\nevolved to be able to go ahead in Pxe\n\n39\n00:01:55.494 --> 00:02:00.161\nboot without relying on that\nolder legacy network adapter.\n\n40\n00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.431\nSo I just want to remind you of that In\nmy lab environment here I have Gen one\n\n41\n00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:05.621\nmachines running.\n\n42\n00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:09.344\nSo if I just right click and\nthen select settings,\n\n43\n00:02:09.344 --> 00:02:14.220\nyou can see that I have the ability\nto go ahead and add either that,\n\n44\n00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.607\nnetwork adapter which\nis the newer version.\n\n45\n00:02:17.607 --> 00:02:21.929\nWhich we sometimes hear the term\nsynthetic adapter associated\n\n46\n00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:26.740\nwith this because they're going to\nbe these newer network adapters,\n\n47\n00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.870\nsynthetic adapters perform better because\nthey're not emulating physical hardware.\n\n48\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.420\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n49\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.985\nSo when you hear that term emulating,\nthey're an emulated adapter.\n\n50\n00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:43.720\nYou'll be referencing a Legacy network\nadapter and the operating system has\n\n51\n00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.490\na harder time recreating that\nphysical adapter than utilizing\n\n52\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.800\na synthetic version, the newer version,\nthe network adapter, that's just built in.\n\n53\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.500\nAnd so\nI just wanted to remind you of that.\n\n54\n00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.350\nAnd then also remind you of the fact that,\nhere, this particular machine, PLABDC01,\n\n55\n00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.050\nif I go ahead and close.\n\n56\n00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.210\nOr here, let me just move this so\nwe can see it a little better.\n\n57\n00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.660\nIn the background here, you can see\nthe state of this machine is off.\n\n58\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.216\nSo if I wanted to go ahead and\nadd a new adapter, I could.\n\n59\n00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:21.158\nIf I compare that to a machine that's\nrunning like our PLAB Win 802 machine and\n\n60\n00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:22.769\nI go to our settings here.\n\n61\n00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.633\nAnd then I take a look at that\nsame section to go ahead and\n\n62\n00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:28.450\nadd that hardware and\nlet zoom in a little bit for you.\n\n63\n00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.699\nAnd move this over.\n\n64\n00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.426\nAnd move this over.\n\n65\n00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:39.760\n[LAUGH] You'll notice that these options\nhere are grayed out because this machine\n\n66\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.930\nis running, so I'm not actually\nable to add that hardware in\n\n67\n00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.580\nif you will, such as creating that\nnetwork adapter, either versions here.\n\n68\n00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.490\nSo I just wanted to point that out for\nyou, before we move forward.\n\n69\n00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.760\nAnd now that I've got my zoom all,\nout of filter here,\n\n70\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.200\nlet me just close that up here.\n\n71\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.458\nAnd let's go back into that DC01, so\nwe can modify those settings here.\n\n72\n00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:06.349\nAll right.\n\n73\n00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:13.225\nOne thing that I'd like to show you, and\nif I just go over to the left hand side\n\n74\n00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:15.850\nhere on my network adapter,\nand I'll zoom in.\n\n75\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.530\nI have one that's preexisting,\nyou can see that right here.\n\n76\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.670\nMy network adapter attached to PLAB,\nprivate,\n\n77\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.758\nthat's gonna be the switch that it's\nattached to or bound to, I should say.\n\n78\n00:04:28.758 --> 00:04:33.230\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and click on this\nplus symbol here and expand that out.\n\n79\n00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.160\nNow, we were looking at our hardware\nacceleration and advanced features\n\n80\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.850\nin the last show, but I do wanna just,\nlike I said expand on that a little bit.\n\n81\n00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.980\nSo one thing that I\ndon't think I mentioned,\n\n82\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.800\nthat I would like to is something called,\nbandwidth management.\n\n83\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.760\nAnd you can see that option's right\nhere and the graphical user interface.\n\n84\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.220\nAnd let me just scroll down\na little bit so we can see that.\n\n85\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.700\nNotice how I can specify how this network\nadapter utilizes network bandwidth.\n\n86\n00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.520\nSo basically I can implement\na type of priority here,\n\n87\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.460\nand I can set upper and\nlower control limits here,\n\n88\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.950\nwith my minimum bandwidth and\nmaximum bandwidth.\n\n89\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.080\nSo, by really defining those upper and\nlower control limits,\n\n90\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.008\nI can set priorities if I had multiple\nadapters for any kind of reason there.\n\n91\n00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:32.170\nSo that's where I could specify\nhere in megabits per second.\n\n92\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.701\nAnd then also, let me just, hold on,\n\n93\n00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:41.090\nminimise, you know what?\n\n94\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.590\nI'll pull a PowerShell real quick,\nbut because this machine is off,\n\n95\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.630\nI don't wanna log into that machine,\nI'll just show you here on the host\n\n96\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.430\nwhat that commandlet would be, if you\nwanted to set it here in PowerShell.\n\n97\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.910\nYou don't need to, oops.\n\n98\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.720\nGo through that entire boot process,\njust to show that one commandlet.\n\n99\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.590\nI'll change the color.\n\n100\n00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:08.410\nAll right,\nI'm just going to shorten this line here.\n\n101\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.460\nAnd so that particular commandlet\nis going to be set-VMnetwork, and\n\n102\n00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.700\nthis is going to be my network adapter,\nand I can tab on through.\n\n103\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.160\nAnd then I'm going to\nspecify the virtual machine.\n\n104\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.920\nSo, I could actually go ahead and\nset this here within my host.\n\n105\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.921\nBecause the host is hosting\nthat virtual machine here and\n\n106\n00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:32.598\nI can just use this VM name parameter.\n\n107\n00:06:32.598 --> 00:06:35.448\nSo VM name and\nthen I'm gonna specify what was that one?\n\n108\n00:06:35.448 --> 00:06:37.170\nPLABDC01.\n\n109\n00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.770\nWe really won't run this, but\nI'm just showing you the syntax here for\n\n110\n00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.940\nyou to go ahead and specify that.\n\n111\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.656\nAnd the parameter here\nis going to be maximum.\n\n112\n00:06:48.656 --> 00:06:53.250\nAll right and I don't know if I can\ntap through quite yet, let's see.\n\n113\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.613\nNo so this is gonna be maximum\nbandwidth and then the number,\n\n114\n00:06:58.613 --> 00:07:04.308\nthe units of measurement that they\nuse here is gonna be in bytes.\n\n115\n00:07:04.308 --> 00:07:07.533\nSo it's kind of crazy if you think\nabout typing it out like this, but\n\n116\n00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:09.295\nyou're gonna go ahead and specify.\n\n117\n00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:13.946\nSo here if I add that's eight zeros,\none two three four five six seven eight.\n\n118\n00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:18.570\nThat's gonna be setting a maximum band\nwith a 200 megabytes per second there.\n\n119\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.490\nSo, that's how you would go ahead and\nyou can use also that other\n\n120\n00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.330\nparameter right here, to go ahead and\nset that low bandwidth as well.\n\n121\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.380\nSo you can go ahead and\nobviously modify that in PowerShell.\n\n122\n00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.400\nI just wanted to show you.\n\n123\n00:07:33.388 --> 00:07:37.760\nAll right, so what else do we have here\nin the GUI, that I wanted to cover?\n\n124\n00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.830\nAnd of course, like with everything else,\nyou can set and specify these parameters.\n\n125\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.956\nThat's syntax, and we'll take a look,\n\n126\n00:07:43.956 --> 00:07:46.340\na little bit more in\nPowerShell as well later.\n\n127\n00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.157\nOkay, if I go under my\nadvanced features here.\n\n128\n00:07:52.157 --> 00:07:54.694\nWe've already spoke about MAC address and\n\n129\n00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:59.215\nwhere we can change that and how we can\nset those ranges on the switch as well.\n\n130\n00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:02.478\nBut we really didn't\ntalk about DHCP Guard, so\n\n131\n00:08:02.478 --> 00:08:07.954\nlet me just kind of zoom in here, and\nwe'll look at each of these individually.\n\n132\n00:08:12.388 --> 00:08:18.966\nAll right, so DHCP guard is going to be,\nit's a stop gap mechanism.\n\n133\n00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:21.663\nOr fail safe mechanism, I should say,\n\n134\n00:08:21.663 --> 00:08:26.830\nto prevent any kind of rogue virtual\nmachines from acting as a DHCP server.\n\n135\n00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:32.719\nSo Microsoft recommends to go ahead and\nenable DHCP Guard,\n\n136\n00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:37.211\nif that machine in fact\nis not a DHCP machine.\n\n137\n00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:42.206\nIf it is going to be a machine, a server\nthat you want to run as a DHCP machine,\n\n138\n00:08:42.206 --> 00:08:45.575\nthen go ahead and\njust leave that unchecked there.\n\n139\n00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:50.288\nBecause what it will do is it will prevent\nthose messages associated with our DHCP\n\n140\n00:08:50.288 --> 00:08:51.412\ncommunications.\n\n141\n00:08:51.412 --> 00:08:56.457\nSo that's something to think about\nas well from a security perspective.\n\n142\n00:08:56.457 --> 00:08:59.883\nIf an attacker were to go ahead and\nhijack one of these machines they could\n\n143\n00:08:59.883 --> 00:09:02.371\npotentially spoof those\ntypes of communications.\n\n144\n00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:07.856\nSo that's one way we can go ahead and\nmitigate those types of attacks here and\n\n145\n00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:11.728\nsimilarly Router guard,\nsame concept, all right?\n\n146\n00:09:11.728 --> 00:09:13.526\nOops, I just clicked on it and\nit moved around on me.\n\n147\n00:09:13.526 --> 00:09:16.246\nBut you guys can see here\nthat it's going to be,\n\n148\n00:09:16.246 --> 00:09:18.831\nRouter guard drops\nrouter advertisement and\n\n149\n00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:23.815\nredirection messages from unauthorized\nvirtual machines pretending to be routers.\n\n150\n00:09:23.815 --> 00:09:28.843\nSo, again, if you are legitimately\nconfiguring a machine to act as a router.\n\n151\n00:09:28.843 --> 00:09:32.914\nThen you definitely want to leave that\nunchecked because you'd be counteracting\n\n152\n00:09:32.914 --> 00:09:34.691\nall of your configurations there.\n\n153\n00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:38.695\nBut just knowing it's there and\navailable to use for\n\n154\n00:09:38.695 --> 00:09:42.518\nsecurity purposes, so\nthis is kind of cool here.\n\n155\n00:09:42.518 --> 00:09:46.821\nIf we go ahead and\nutilize the protected network,\n\n156\n00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:50.620\nwhich we can see is\nenabled here by default.\n\n157\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.948\nIf we're utilizing clusters,\nthen this virtual machine,\n\n158\n00:09:53.948 --> 00:09:56.764\nif there were some kind of\na catastrophic failure.\n\n159\n00:09:56.764 --> 00:10:00.863\nThen it would go ahead and move this\nvirtual machine to another cluster node if\n\n160\n00:10:00.863 --> 00:10:02.953\na network disconnection is detected.\n\n161\n00:10:02.953 --> 00:10:06.451\nSo just knowing that that's here and\nthat's where we can configure that.\n\n162\n00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:11.061\nWe also have port mirroring, excuse me,\n\n163\n00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:13.956\nI'm trying not to get\nyou guys seasick here.\n\n164\n00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:19.538\nBut I want to get it zoomed in so you can\nsee that as well, port mirroring, right?\n\n165\n00:10:19.538 --> 00:10:21.932\nSo you may have heard of this before,\n\n166\n00:10:21.932 --> 00:10:27.044\nespecially if you've taken any of our\nclasses or courses here on maybe Net+.\n\n167\n00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:28.935\nAnd probably in Security+ as well,\n\n168\n00:10:28.935 --> 00:10:32.480\nbecause you talk about different\nreasons as to why we would use that.\n\n169\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.172\nAnd in thinking about layer\ntwo on those switches,\n\n170\n00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:38.748\nwe can utilize port mirroring for\nthings like network monitoring.\n\n171\n00:10:38.748 --> 00:10:43.056\nOr troubleshooting if we wanted to\nrun a utility such as Wire Shark or\n\n172\n00:10:43.056 --> 00:10:44.502\nsomething like that.\n\n173\n00:10:44.502 --> 00:10:48.124\nSo just knowing that this is\nwhere you could go ahead and\n\n174\n00:10:48.124 --> 00:10:50.496\nset that up to enable that feature.\n\n175\n00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:55.376\nIf you wanted to use it on one\nof your virtual machines here.\n\n176\n00:10:55.376 --> 00:11:00.206\nAnd lastly, [LAUGH], and\nagain, let me just scroll for\n\n177\n00:11:00.206 --> 00:11:03.882\nyou, this is going to be our NIC Teaming.\n\n178\n00:11:03.882 --> 00:11:09.218\nSo this is what I really want us to\nkind of think about here is NIC Teaming.\n\n179\n00:11:09.218 --> 00:11:12.170\nNow we've spoke about this\nbefore in previous episodes,\n\n180\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.375\nif you haven't seen them,\nthen I would encourage you to do so.\n\n181\n00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:17.727\nBecause a lot of the settings and\n\n182\n00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:23.221\nconfigurations carry over from our\nhardware physical configurations for\n\n183\n00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:27.941\nNIC Teaming into the way that we\ncan use them here within Hyper V.\n\n184\n00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:30.487\nNot everything is exactly the same,\nI mean,\n\n185\n00:11:30.487 --> 00:11:33.308\nwe're talking about\nhardware versus software.\n\n186\n00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:36.749\nSo I'll definitely go ahead and\npoint those differences out, but\n\n187\n00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:39.341\njust being familiar with\nthe concept in general.\n\n188\n00:11:39.341 --> 00:11:42.945\nAnd maybe you're not familiar with it,\nso what is NIC Teaming,\n\n189\n00:11:42.945 --> 00:11:45.705\nwhy would I want to use it,\nwhat does it do for me?\n\n190\n00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.887\nSo, it's kind of funny because\nthis term NIC Teaming,\n\n191\n00:11:48.887 --> 00:11:50.860\nthat's what Microsoft calls it.\n\n192\n00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.399\nDifferent vendors, there are so many\ndifferent terms out there for it, I mean,\n\n193\n00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:57.419\nethernet teaming, I can't even.\n\n194\n00:11:57.419 --> 00:12:01.882\nYou've got link aggregation, NIC bonding,\nall sorts of different names out there,\n\n195\n00:12:01.882 --> 00:12:03.973\nbut it's kind of like an umbrella term.\n\n196\n00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:09.210\nSo people aren't really going to look down\nupon you if you say link aggregation or\n\n197\n00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:10.141\nNIC bonding.\n\n198\n00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:12.614\nBut Microsoft, if you're taking the exam,\n\n199\n00:12:12.614 --> 00:12:15.811\nyou do need to know that\nterminology here for NIC Teaming.\n\n200\n00:12:15.811 --> 00:12:19.349\n&gt;&gt; And Charity, one of the things that I\nthink is great about the fact that we have\n\n201\n00:12:19.349 --> 00:12:20.609\nthe NIC Teaming in Server.\n\n202\n00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:25.383\nAnd what they've done with Microsoft is\nthat in the earlier editions of Server.\n\n203\n00:12:25.383 --> 00:12:29.689\nAnd I can't think of the actual edition\nwhere it abstracted in the software,\n\n204\n00:12:29.689 --> 00:12:32.018\nI want to say 2003, 2008-ish.\n\n205\n00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:35.839\nPrior to this technology, if you\nwanted to do this link aggregation or\n\n206\n00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.642\nthis NIC Teaming,\nlike Cherokee's explaining.\n\n207\n00:12:38.642 --> 00:12:42.381\nI mean, you had to have an Intel\nadapter with an Intel device, or\n\n208\n00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:44.750\nyou had to have Broadcom with Broadcom.\n\n209\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.461\nSo there wasn't a mix and match.\n\n210\n00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:49.797\nAnd that could get very expensive and\nit could get you vendor locked.\n\n211\n00:12:49.797 --> 00:12:52.459\nAnd now, and\nit's been this way for a while,\n\n212\n00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:57.030\nthat we have that software is able to do\nthe bonding that you can mix and match.\n\n213\n00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.359\nI can have Intel with Broadcom and\n\n214\n00:12:59.359 --> 00:13:04.193\nI can let the software itself bond\nthose network adaptors together.\n\n215\n00:13:04.193 --> 00:13:05.953\nSo I think it's a fascinating technology,\n\n216\n00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:08.484\nnow they can be handled inside\nof the operating system itself.\n\n217\n00:13:08.484 --> 00:13:11.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the way that they've just\ninserted it into the operating system and\n\n218\n00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:12.087\nintegrated it there.\n\n219\n00:13:12.087 --> 00:13:15.700\nBecause before, like Wes said,\nyou'd have to go out to a third party,\n\n220\n00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.063\na vendor there to go ahead and\nuse NIC Teaming.\n\n221\n00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:20.625\nSo this idea has been around for\na long time,\n\n222\n00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:25.079\nbut now we just see it as an integrated\nfeature within the operating system.\n\n223\n00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:25.910\nSo, it's pretty cool.\n\n224\n00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:31.725\nNow, in order to leverage and\nutilize NIC Teaming on a virtual machine,\n\n225\n00:13:31.725 --> 00:13:34.790\nyou would need to do one of two things.\n\n226\n00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:39.204\nThe first step would be, well, I guess, it\nreally wouldn't have to be the first step.\n\n227\n00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:40.246\nBut you would have to have it,\n\n228\n00:13:40.246 --> 00:13:42.594\nit could be your last step before\nyou want to go ahead and deploy it.\n\n229\n00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:47.286\nBut you would have to either\nselect this check box here from\n\n230\n00:13:47.286 --> 00:13:52.375\nwithin the graphical user interface,\nokay, and then hit OK.\n\n231\n00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:56.724\nOr alternatively, we'll just hit cancel\nnow, and let me pull up PowerShell.\n\n232\n00:13:56.724 --> 00:14:01.310\nAnd I'll show you the actual\nsyntax that you would be using.\n\n233\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:06.644\nAnd again, for this one, I can't run\nit in my, let me change that again,\n\n234\n00:14:06.644 --> 00:14:11.740\nI think I closed out before, just to\nmake it a little bit bigger for us.\n\n235\n00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:18.508\nOkay, that should be good,\nall right, what I was saying here?\n\n236\n00:14:18.508 --> 00:14:22.863\nSo I said ,you can go ahead and\nconfigure that on a per machine basis,\n\n237\n00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:25.428\nthere in the graphical user interface.\n\n238\n00:14:25.428 --> 00:14:27.827\nBut here on the host operating system,\n\n239\n00:14:27.827 --> 00:14:32.488\nI could configure on a per machine level\nalso, so I would just specify that.\n\n240\n00:14:32.488 --> 00:14:39.492\nSo what I'm going to do is\nuse the set-vmnetworkadapter.\n\n241\n00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:47.784\nAnd that's going to be, we're going to\nset a perimeter to specify the name.\n\n242\n00:14:47.784 --> 00:14:53.322\nSo we'll say VMName, and then my\nvirtual machine name here, what one?\n\n243\n00:14:53.322 --> 00:15:00.060\nLet's actually set this up for our domain\nmember, not on our domain controller here,\n\n244\n00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.420\nso we'll say PLAB, DM,\nfor our domain member, 01.\n\n245\n00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.385\nAnd then we'll use\nthe AllowTeaming parameter.\n\n246\n00:15:07.385 --> 00:15:12.650\nSo AllowTeaming, and\nthen here you can specify either on or\n\n247\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.824\noff, so we'll go ahead and hit on.\n\n248\n00:15:15.824 --> 00:15:21.548\nAnd then now, oops, where did I,\nI have some kind of syntax issue here.\n\n249\n00:15:21.548 --> 00:15:26.236\nTerms set would be in the network adapter,\n\n250\n00:15:26.236 --> 00:15:29.999\nspace, that would help, all right.\n\n251\n00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:32.882\nNow, we would be able to go ahead and\n\n252\n00:15:32.882 --> 00:15:38.665\nproceed forward with the configuration\nto get that VM Teaming, okay?\n\n253\n00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:42.807\nSo either one of those two ways\nto go ahead and set that up.\n\n254\n00:15:42.807 --> 00:15:45.018\nBut let's just,\nlet me minimize that up here.\n\n255\n00:15:45.018 --> 00:15:50.117\nAnd I'd like to take a minute to\nreiterate some concepts that we did\n\n256\n00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:55.047\ncover in that NIC Teaming episode\nthat we previously recorded.\n\n257\n00:15:55.047 --> 00:15:59.302\nBut I want to remind you of\nhow NIC Teaming works, and\n\n258\n00:15:59.302 --> 00:16:03.678\nthen bring it on into this\nvirtualization Idea here.\n\n259\n00:16:03.678 --> 00:16:08.948\nSo when we're talking about different\ntypes of teaming modes here, all right?\n\n260\n00:16:08.948 --> 00:16:13.184\nWe have switch-dependent teaming mode and\nswitch-independent teaming mode,\n\n261\n00:16:13.184 --> 00:16:14.236\nas you can see here.\n\n262\n00:16:14.236 --> 00:16:17.542\nAnd the name is pretty\nself explanatory here.\n\n263\n00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:23.764\nSwitch-dependent teaming mode is going\nto be, well, dependent of that switch.\n\n264\n00:16:23.764 --> 00:16:27.129\nMeaning that switch is going to\nbe a single point of failure.\n\n265\n00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:32.485\nAnd that's something that in a production\nenvironment we try to avoid at all costs,\n\n266\n00:16:32.485 --> 00:16:35.662\nwe try to implement\nredundancy in multiple ways.\n\n267\n00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:40.248\nAnd that's one of the main reasons\nwhy you would use NIC teaming, or\n\n268\n00:16:40.248 --> 00:16:41.706\nNIC bonding, here.\n\n269\n00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:45.989\nThe other reason would be for\nincreased performance.\n\n270\n00:16:45.989 --> 00:16:51.239\nAnd so you can see here I have two network\ninterface parts running at the same speed,\n\n271\n00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:52.814\nand that's important.\n\n272\n00:16:52.814 --> 00:16:56.774\nAnd if you think about other technologies,\nlike setting up rate configurations.\n\n273\n00:16:56.774 --> 00:17:00.770\nAnd we always say, hey, it's important\nto get very similar pieces of hardware.\n\n274\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:05.457\nAnd so with the right configurations, it's\nimportant because you'll be losing storage\n\n275\n00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:07.316\nif they want the same storage size.\n\n276\n00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:12.078\nWell, here, it's kind of interesting,\nbecause if I had a ten gigabit per second,\n\n277\n00:17:12.078 --> 00:17:13.767\nand a one gigabit per second.\n\n278\n00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:19.493\nAnd there are different algorithms,\nand we'll talk about those different\n\n279\n00:17:19.493 --> 00:17:24.606\nalgorithms that I can select to\nchoose to help me load balance here.\n\n280\n00:17:24.606 --> 00:17:27.193\nSo which NIC is gonna be\nhandling this traffic, and\n\n281\n00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:31.182\nwhich one is gonna be handling, how\nthey're gonna be handling this traffic.\n\n282\n00:17:31.182 --> 00:17:36.013\nSo when it comes to working, especially\nimportant here with our virtualization and\n\n283\n00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.994\nusing NIC teams inside of our VMs.\n\n284\n00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:41.522\nBecause if I had a ten gigabit\nnetwork interface card, and\n\n285\n00:17:41.522 --> 00:17:46.283\nthe operating system were to recognize\nthat, and send traffic accordingly.\n\n286\n00:17:46.283 --> 00:17:50.804\nAnd then I had a one gigabit, how is\nthat one gigabit NIC gonna be handling\n\n287\n00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:53.561\nthe amount that's being sent for\na ten gig?\n\n288\n00:17:53.561 --> 00:17:56.976\nSo those are just things that you'd\nwanna consider when you're looking at\n\n289\n00:17:56.976 --> 00:17:59.642\nthe hardware before moving\non into that virtualization.\n\n290\n00:17:59.642 --> 00:18:02.856\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee, one of the things I'm\nlooking here at the diagram that you've\n\n291\n00:18:02.856 --> 00:18:04.351\ngot is, with switch-dependent.\n\n292\n00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:07.565\nIt seems like, well, this would be\ndone just for sheer performance,\n\n293\n00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:09.756\nright, cuz we talk about redundancy,\nright?\n\n294\n00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:11.458\nIt's one of the things that,\nwe could do it for performance,\n\n295\n00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:12.323\nwe could do it for redundancy.\n\n296\n00:18:12.323 --> 00:18:16.313\nBut my thought process is, if you hook two\nnetwork adapters to the same switch, and\n\n297\n00:18:16.313 --> 00:18:17.282\nthat switch fails.\n\n298\n00:18:17.282 --> 00:18:20.437\nThen you don't have any fault tolerance,\nyou don't have any redundancy.\n\n299\n00:18:20.437 --> 00:18:23.408\nBut you could get, like you said,\nthe increased bandwidth.\n\n300\n00:18:23.408 --> 00:18:26.562\nWhere switch-independent,\nyou can get increased bandwidth, but\n\n301\n00:18:26.562 --> 00:18:29.452\nyou can also get a little bit\nof resiliency to failure, right?\n\n302\n00:18:29.452 --> 00:18:30.848\nOne of the switches fails,\n\n303\n00:18:30.848 --> 00:18:34.075\nat least I still have kind of\na moderate amount of a connection.\n\n304\n00:18:34.075 --> 00:18:37.030\nNow the other thing that I also\nwould think too here is that.\n\n305\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:43.992\nLike in switch-dependant, you would see\na noticable performance degradation,\n\n306\n00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:48.178\nif one,\nlet's say one of the NICs fails, right?\n\n307\n00:18:48.178 --> 00:18:51.437\nVersus in a switch-independent,\nif you're still operating for\n\n308\n00:18:51.437 --> 00:18:54.067\nmore of a fault tolerance,\nyou're getting one gig.\n\n309\n00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:58.250\nAnd one gig, if one network adapter fails,\nyou don't really know the performance hit.\n\n310\n00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.282\nSo like you said, it does seem that you\nreally have to consider which one you're\n\n311\n00:19:02.282 --> 00:19:04.461\ngonna go with prior to implementing this.\n\n312\n00:19:04.461 --> 00:19:08.136\n&gt;&gt; That's a really great point, Wes, and\nso let's talk about that for a second.\n\n313\n00:19:08.136 --> 00:19:10.807\nSo what Wes is saying, hey,\nso if I'm planning and\n\n314\n00:19:10.807 --> 00:19:15.178\nI'm trying to decide if I want to use\nswitch-dependent or switch-independent.\n\n315\n00:19:15.178 --> 00:19:17.384\nAnd if we could just take\na look at that again, so\n\n316\n00:19:17.384 --> 00:19:20.429\nwe can try to map this out to\nthe diagram of what he was saying here.\n\n317\n00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:23.833\nSo here with my\nswitch-dependent configuration,\n\n318\n00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:28.331\nI've got both these NICs working\ntogether as a team, that NIC team.\n\n319\n00:19:28.331 --> 00:19:31.457\nAnd you can see that output\nthere at 2 gigabits per second.\n\n320\n00:19:31.457 --> 00:19:36.322\nSo if I had configured both of these\nNICs to actively be functioning and\n\n321\n00:19:36.322 --> 00:19:38.059\nhandling that traffic.\n\n322\n00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:42.232\nAnd network adaptors,\nNICs are a lot better,\n\n323\n00:19:42.232 --> 00:19:47.588\nlike the hardware nowadays,\nthan they were ten years ago.\n\n324\n00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:52.818\nAnd if you think about it,\nthere's also a lot of logic to that.\n\n325\n00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:56.369\nBecause I remember when I was first\nstarting out and working with end users.\n\n326\n00:19:56.369 --> 00:20:00.743\nI had these big, clunky boxes that I\nwas moving around all the time and\n\n327\n00:20:00.743 --> 00:20:02.416\nbringing in for repairs.\n\n328\n00:20:02.416 --> 00:20:05.512\nAnd nowadays, when we're looking\nat a lot of our systems.\n\n329\n00:20:05.512 --> 00:20:11.426\nAnd especially in our enterprising\nservers, those are usually rack mounted,\n\n330\n00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:15.674\nand very rarely or\nseldomly get moved around or jostled.\n\n331\n00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:19.022\nSo sometimes it would even just\nbe a NIC being unseated and\n\n332\n00:20:19.022 --> 00:20:21.478\nyou'd have to go ahead and put it back in.\n\n333\n00:20:21.478 --> 00:20:26.472\nSo what would happen if that NIC were\nto fall out of its slot a little bit or\n\n334\n00:20:26.472 --> 00:20:28.228\nhad a hardware failure?\n\n335\n00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:31.737\nAnd we wouldn't be able to use it,\nwe wouldn't be able to count on it.\n\n336\n00:20:31.737 --> 00:20:36.029\nSo what Wes is saying is, yeah, instead\nof expecting to see that 2 gigabits per\n\n337\n00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:39.118\nsecond, I'd only see that\none gigabit per second here.\n\n338\n00:20:39.118 --> 00:20:44.024\nSo I wouldn't be completely disabled,\nI will just limited there,\n\n339\n00:20:44.024 --> 00:20:46.962\nor yeah, so I guess if that makes sense.\n\n340\n00:20:46.962 --> 00:20:49.133\nSo I would still be able to communicate,\nbut\n\n341\n00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:51.785\njust not at that speed that\nI was expecting or used to.\n\n342\n00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:55.552\nSo that would be\nan active-active configuration.\n\n343\n00:20:55.552 --> 00:20:57.057\nIn both of these situations,\n\n344\n00:20:57.057 --> 00:21:01.221\nthough, I do have the ability to set\nsomething that's called active-passive.\n\n345\n00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:04.095\nSo if I had a particular application, or\n\n346\n00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:08.829\nsome kind of software that really\nwas dependent or contingent upon\n\n347\n00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:13.665\nhaving a stable environment,\nI could still have that redundancy.\n\n348\n00:21:13.665 --> 00:21:16.617\nI just wouldn't have an influx or\nincrease in bandwidth,\n\n349\n00:21:16.617 --> 00:21:20.424\nI wouldn't have that aggregation of\nbandwidth or additional bandwidth.\n\n350\n00:21:20.424 --> 00:21:27.097\nSo, I could set one of these NICs\nin stand by or passive mode.\n\n351\n00:21:27.097 --> 00:21:31.279\nAnd it will just kind of be like\nsitting on the bench, waiting for\n\n352\n00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:33.457\na player to get injured, right?\n\n353\n00:21:33.457 --> 00:21:36.582\nSo if one of those NICs were to fail,\n\n354\n00:21:36.582 --> 00:21:42.120\nthen that passover standby adapter\nwould go ahead and kick in.\n\n355\n00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.006\nAnd fill in for their teammate there,\nso that's what would happen,\n\n356\n00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:48.962\nyou would still see that\ncontinuity with the speed.\n\n357\n00:21:48.962 --> 00:21:51.662\nBut it would always be here in this\nparticular example at that one\n\n358\n00:21:51.662 --> 00:21:52.563\ngigabit per second.\n\n359\n00:21:52.563 --> 00:21:56.694\nSo it's kind of like you're not taking\nadvantage of all of the adaptors in your\n\n360\n00:21:56.694 --> 00:21:58.329\nenvironment at the same time.\n\n361\n00:21:58.329 --> 00:22:02.714\nBut you're really, if you're focused\nmore upon having that stability.\n\n362\n00:22:02.714 --> 00:22:06.827\nAnd, again, you can do that in both of\nthese configurations, just set one up for\n\n363\n00:22:06.827 --> 00:22:07.626\nthat passive.\n\n364\n00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:12.329\nBut, like Wes was saying,\nit would be smart, really smart,\n\n365\n00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:17.221\nif you have the budget to go ahead and\nhave that active-active.\n\n366\n00:22:17.221 --> 00:22:20.604\nBecause you're gonna be taking advantage\nof that additional hardware there\n\n367\n00:22:20.604 --> 00:22:21.444\nwith your switch.\n\n368\n00:22:21.444 --> 00:22:24.025\nSo you're not just relying\non that one all the time, so\n\n369\n00:22:24.025 --> 00:22:26.228\nthat's just something\nto think about there.\n\n370\n00:22:26.228 --> 00:22:31.135\nAs a matter of fact, there's a lot\nto think about, so let me pull up,\n\n371\n00:22:31.135 --> 00:22:36.653\nlet's see, I've got a link here, and\nI've put this link in the show notes.\n\n372\n00:22:36.653 --> 00:22:38.435\nLet me just zoom in for us,\n\n373\n00:22:38.435 --> 00:22:44.045\nthis is actually gonna be a Microsoft Word\ndocument that Microsoft put together.\n\n374\n00:22:44.045 --> 00:22:48.629\nAnd you can download it straight from\nthis link that I've got for you,\n\n375\n00:22:48.629 --> 00:22:52.366\nand it's just,\nit's a nice user guide for NIC teaming.\n\n376\n00:22:52.366 --> 00:22:56.133\nSo not only does it cover\nhow to set up NIC teaming,\n\n377\n00:22:56.133 --> 00:23:00.910\nleveraging it in regular\ninstances without virtualization.\n\n378\n00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.067\nBut it also covers specific details\nthat are pertinent to virtualization\n\n379\n00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:06.147\nconfigurations.\n\n380\n00:23:06.147 --> 00:23:11.245\nSo let me just show you what that\nlooks like, and it's a lot here.\n\n381\n00:23:11.245 --> 00:23:16.086\nSo we're scratching the surface, but\nif you really wanted to delve deeper, so\n\n382\n00:23:16.086 --> 00:23:18.843\nwe're covering the objectives on the exam.\n\n383\n00:23:18.843 --> 00:23:22.671\nBut if you were to set this up in\nyour own environment for production,\n\n384\n00:23:22.671 --> 00:23:26.573\nthere might be different configurations\nthat you want to implement.\n\n385\n00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:29.317\nAnd you're not sure how they\nwould interact together, so\n\n386\n00:23:29.317 --> 00:23:30.665\nyou can just read up on that.\n\n387\n00:23:30.665 --> 00:23:34.445\nThere are also a list of definitions\nhere that I want to point out.\n\n388\n00:23:34.445 --> 00:23:38.599\nNow I'm not gonna read all of these\nto you, but I do wanna cover them,\n\n389\n00:23:38.599 --> 00:23:41.477\nthis is something that we\ndo need to be aware of.\n\n390\n00:23:41.477 --> 00:23:45.588\nBecause when we're dealing with\nthese intangible concepts,\n\n391\n00:23:45.588 --> 00:23:48.621\nI want to put it in a way\nthat makes sense to you.\n\n392\n00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:50.843\nI don't know if that always comes across,\nso\n\n393\n00:23:50.843 --> 00:23:54.537\nI'm gonna try to rehash it throughout\nthis show, as well as the next show.\n\n394\n00:23:54.537 --> 00:23:56.689\nWe'll see how we can\nactually implement it, and\n\n395\n00:23:56.689 --> 00:23:58.905\nthen I'll show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n396\n00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:02.242\nSo just a couple of things\nto think about here,\n\n397\n00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:06.093\nyou'll notice LACP,\nthis is actually a protocol And\n\n398\n00:24:06.093 --> 00:24:10.816\nthis is another one of those terms\nthat are kind of industry wide.\n\n399\n00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:14.776\nYou'll hear these umbrella terms and\nyou're not gonna get frowned upon if you\n\n400\n00:24:14.776 --> 00:24:17.424\nuse, there's a couple\ndifferent protocols here.\n\n401\n00:24:17.424 --> 00:24:20.960\nAnd let me just make sure I'm\ncalling out the right ones for you.\n\n402\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.045\nThis is going to be 802.1, I know it,\n\n403\n00:24:25.045 --> 00:24:30.550\nwe've got ax and\naq are gonna be the newer protocols.\n\n404\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.837\nSometimes people will say 802.3ad,\n\n405\n00:24:33.837 --> 00:24:40.050\nwhich is the older protocol that was\nassociated with the same concept here.\n\n406\n00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:44.679\nAnd so here within Microsoft's options,\nyou'll see lock p for link aggregation\n\n407\n00:24:44.679 --> 00:24:49.320\nprotocol, will be the option that you\nhave when you're studying up NIC teaming.\n\n408\n00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.410\nNIC, it is what it is, it's just that\nphysical network interface card.\n\n409\n00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.050\nReceive side scaling, this is going\nto be an integration feature,\n\n410\n00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.390\njust how the operating system's\ndealing with those incoming packets,\n\n411\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.520\nand taking advantage of utilizing\nmultiple processors there.\n\n412\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.395\nNow TNIC, now this is an interesting one,\n\n413\n00:25:09.395 --> 00:25:14.610\nTNIC is going to be where we're actually\ncreating a team, and then that outward\n\n414\n00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.145\nfacing adapter that's bound to that team,\nthat's what we're talking about here.\n\n415\n00:25:18.145 --> 00:25:23.010\nVLAN, hopefully we know what VLAN is at\nthis point, if not, it's right there,\n\n416\n00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.840\nand we've got tons of shows on that.\n\n417\n00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.210\nVM, you guys know what VM is, so let me\njust go to the more important one here.\n\n418\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.627\nThis is gonna be a VMnet, and this is\ngonna be the port on the Hyper-V switch\n\n419\n00:25:34.627 --> 00:25:38.590\nthat's exposed as a networking\ninterface inside that virtual machine.\n\n420\n00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.600\nVirtual machine cues, again,\n\n421\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.250\nthis is another way that we can\naggregate all that incoming traffic.\n\n422\n00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.800\nAnd really, there's this term,\nit's called affinity,\n\n423\n00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.137\nand so the way that those traffic,\nthose TCP flows are gonna be handled.\n\n424\n00:25:53.137 --> 00:25:55.939\nAffinities mean that they\nhave a preference for\n\n425\n00:25:55.939 --> 00:25:59.730\ndifferent ways that that traffic\nis going to be dispersed.\n\n426\n00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.060\nAnd we'll take a look at that\na little bit more in depth as well.\n\n427\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.719\nThe last one I really want to\nnote out here is gonna be a VNIC.\n\n428\n00:26:05.719 --> 00:26:10.372\nWhich is a port on the Hyper-V switch\nexposed as the networking interface in\n\n429\n00:26:10.372 --> 00:26:12.470\nthe host partition.\n\n430\n00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.010\nAll right, so Cherokee,\nwhat does that really mean?\n\n431\n00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:19.850\nI know I'm reading it to you, but\nlet me try to put it in a visual way.\n\n432\n00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:23.210\nBecause I'm a visual learner, and so\nmaybe this will help you, as well.\n\n433\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.420\nAnd just looking at these\ndifferent components here,\n\n434\n00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.280\nright, we can look at the hardware.\n\n435\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.220\nThis is the host machine,\nthe physical hardware, right?\n\n436\n00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.779\nAnd just like we saw in that previous\ndiagram, here we have two switches.\n\n437\n00:26:34.779 --> 00:26:37.900\nWhich, like Wes and I spoke about, this\nisn't really a smart way to go ahead and\n\n438\n00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.422\nset that up.\n\n439\n00:26:38.422 --> 00:26:42.910\nBut that's switch independent,\nI'm not dependent on just that one switch.\n\n440\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.720\nAnd then that machine, that server, and\n\n441\n00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.810\nout here, we have two physical network\ninterface cards, those are just our NICs.\n\n442\n00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.950\nAnd in a production environment,\n\n443\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:58.170\nwe would never want to have\njust one NIC in that server.\n\n444\n00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:03.191\nAs a matter of fact, in NIC teaming,\nwithout virtualization, when I\n\n445\n00:27:03.191 --> 00:27:09.250\ncreate those teams there in the host, I\ncan have up to 32 network interface cards.\n\n446\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:13.990\nSo two is kinda of on the low end here,\nbut we want to at least have two here for\n\n447\n00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.980\nthat redundancy.\n\n448\n00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.073\nNow if we look at the way that these\nother components are configured, right.\n\n449\n00:27:20.073 --> 00:27:24.103\nSo inside of our host operating system,\nwe can create virtual machines, and\n\n450\n00:27:24.103 --> 00:27:27.270\nthat's what this yellow\nrectangle is representing, a VM.\n\n451\n00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:33.935\nNow, inside of my VM,\nI have VM NICs, and whether\n\n452\n00:27:33.935 --> 00:27:39.172\nyou recognized it or not, you guys have\njust seeing how we can create VM NICs.\n\n453\n00:27:39.172 --> 00:27:41.776\nAnd that was through\ngenerating those adapters,\n\n454\n00:27:41.776 --> 00:27:44.693\nso those adapters are associated\nwith those machines.\n\n455\n00:27:44.693 --> 00:27:49.193\nWhether it be a legacy adapter, or\njust an option there, the newer option for\n\n456\n00:27:49.193 --> 00:27:53.410\nthe network adapter,\nthose are called your VM NICs, right?\n\n457\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:59.720\nNow if I take two or more of those\nadapters and bind them together to create\n\n458\n00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.310\na team, then essentially the operating\nsystem is going to see that as a whole.\n\n459\n00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.110\nSo now, I would call that a TNIC,\nfor that adapter,\n\n460\n00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.390\nso that's where that term\ncomes into play here.\n\n461\n00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.352\nYour vNIC is a little different, your\nvNIC is going to be the adapter that's\n\n462\n00:28:17.352 --> 00:28:21.097\nactually creating a bond to\nthe physical network interface card.\n\n463\n00:28:21.097 --> 00:28:24.715\nSo you don't wanna include that\nvNIC in any of your teams there,\n\n464\n00:28:24.715 --> 00:28:29.071\nbecause the virtual switch relies on\nthat to associate it with the physical.\n\n465\n00:28:29.071 --> 00:28:35.397\nSo that you could essentially get out to\nthe wire there, the physical equipment,\n\n466\n00:28:35.397 --> 00:28:40.970\nso you could leave the shell of\nthat hardware enclosure there.\n\n467\n00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.482\nSo just looking at the list,\n\n468\n00:28:42.482 --> 00:28:45.891\nI think we've covered about\neverything to really get started.\n\n469\n00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:48.465\nBut we haven't actually\ncreated any of these teams, so\n\n470\n00:28:48.465 --> 00:28:52.203\nif you're wondering how the heck do we\ndo that, you're gonna wanna stay tuned.\n\n471\n00:28:52.203 --> 00:28:54.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthat's a perfect place to stop.\n\n472\n00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.840\nCherokee, as always,\nwe do appreciate you being here.\n\n473\n00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.400\nKeep in mind, though,\nwe're gonna have to go into a part four.\n\n474\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.080\nThat's right, we can get this stuff\nonline, get it configured, and\n\n475\n00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.050\nshow you how it works.\n\n476\n00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.500\nBut Cherokee, great job as always, we\nappreciate you stopping by in the studios,\n\n477\n00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.765\nand we appreciate you,\nthe viewer, watching.\n\n478\n00:29:08.765 --> 00:29:12.090\nRemember, you can watch this show and\nthousands of hours of additional content\n\n479\n00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:13.937\nby just jumping over\nto our course library.\n\n480\n00:29:13.937 --> 00:29:16.236\nBut until we see you again,\nsigning out for ITProTV,\n\n481\n00:29:16.236 --> 00:29:17.628\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n482\n00:29:17.628 --> 00:29:18.228\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n483\n00:29:18.228 --> 00:29:19.385\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n484\n00:29:19.385 -->

out there.\n\n7\n00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.097\nThanks for tuning in.\n\n8\n00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:15.987\nWe got a great show in store for\nyou today.\n\n9\n00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:17.676\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan, and\n\n10\n00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.640\nin today's episode we're continuing\nthrough our series in the 70-410,\n\n11\n00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.327\nthat's right the path that leads to\nthe MCSA and Windows Server 2012.\n\n12\n00:00:25.327 --> 00:00:27.265\nJoining us back in the studios is Ms.\nCherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:28.265\nCherokee how you doing today?\n\n14\n00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:29.737\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great today,\nhow are you today Wes?\n\n15\n00:00:29.737 --> 00:00:30.532\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing okay,\n\n16\n00:00:30.532 --> 00:00:34.295\nover the past few episodes here we've been\ntalking about Hyper-V Networking, and\n\n17\n00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:37.909\nwe gotta pick up because well, we didn't\ndo some of the configuration, right?\n\n18\n00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee was very,\n\n19\n00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:42.566\nvery mean in the last episode, and\nwe left you with a cliffhanger.\n\n20\n00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.798\nSo is that where we're\ngonna be picking up?\n\n21\n00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:44.895\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n22\n00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:48.996\nSo, we did kind of start with a couple of\nthings that I showed you in the last show\n\n23\n00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:52.168\nthat I'll just reiterate real\nquick before we get started in\n\n24\n00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:53.930\nour actual demonstration here.\n\n25\n00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.430\nSo, if you don't remember\nwe were looking at\n\n26\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.360\nNIC teaming gear withing\nour virtual machines.\n\n27\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.320\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look\nat my screen here, and join me for\n\n28\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.100\nthis if you will.\n\n29\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.580\nI did say that there is a configuration\nthat needs to be enabled in order for\n\n30\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.636\na virtual machine to allow the adaptors\nto participate in this wonderful feature,\n\n31\n00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:20.546\nand that's going to be\nconfigured in one of two ways.\n\n32\n00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:24.281\nSo remember, I did show you here,\nnot here in Notepad,\n\n33\n00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:29.048\nbut in the last show I showed you in\nPowerShell what the commandlet was to\n\n34\n00:01:29.048 --> 00:01:33.914\ngo ahead and run to turn teaming on for\nthat particular virtual machine.\n\n35\n00:01:33.914 --> 00:01:39.074\nSo if you just look at the syntax,\nit's just utilizing Set-VMNetworkAdapter,\n\n36\n00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:43.010\nand then you're specifying\nthe virtual machine's name.\n\n37\n00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.950\nSo for our demonstration, we're gonna\nbe using virtual machine PLABDM, for\n\n38\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.310\ndomain member 01, and then we use\nthe parameter -AllowTeaming, and\n\n39\n00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.258\nthen you have that on or\noff for that Boolean there.\n\n40\n00:01:55.258 --> 00:02:00.892\nSo let's just go ahead and\nminimize this, and the other option was,\n\n41\n00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:05.166\nlet me go ahead and\npull up our Hyper-V manager, and\n\n42\n00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.373\nI'll just borrow the settings here for\n\n43\n00:02:08.373 --> 00:02:13.360\nour domain controller,\nto show you where it was real quick.\n\n44\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.769\nThat was going to be on\nthis particular machine,\n\n45\n00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.439\nI only have one adapter for\nthis domain controller.\n\n46\n00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.800\nRemember, in real life,\nwhen we spoke about this,\n\n47\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.323\nyou wanna have more than one\nadapter in production, but\n\n48\n00:02:25.323 --> 00:02:28.180\nI'm just showing you exactly\nwhere this setting was located.\n\n49\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.952\nThat's what I really wanna point out here.\n\n50\n00:02:29.952 --> 00:02:33.754\nIf I expand out this arrow,\nunder our advanced features,\n\n51\n00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:36.859\nremember that was all\nthe way at the bottom, and\n\n52\n00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.680\nlet me kind of move my scroll bar so\nwe can see that, if it's legible here.\n\n53\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.750\nA little bit more.\n\n54\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.844\nAll right.\n\n55\n00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:50.160\nSo this portion right here, and\nI can zoom in a little more if we need to.\n\n56\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.634\nYeah, that's better.\n\n57\n00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:55.630\nNIC Teaming.\n\n58\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.631\nSo this is where I would go ahead and\n\n59\n00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:02.272\nenable that on the per machine basis here\nwithin the graphical user interface.\n\n60\n00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:07.525\nSo one of those ways, whatever you choose,\nbut I just wanted to remind you that\n\n61\n00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:13.116\nhas to be done before that machine will\nactually participate and create that team.\n\n62\n00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:19.044\nNow, I have my domain member up and\nrunning here,\n\n63\n00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:23.721\nand I've pulled my server manager up.\n\n64\n00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:27.350\nSo, couple different ways\nwe could do this here.\n\n65\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.659\nI've added two different\nadapters to this machine.\n\n66\n00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.846\nSo like I said, in Hyper-V Microsoft\nsays they will only support teams.\n\n67\n00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:39.679\nIf you're creating a team\ninside of a virtual machine,\n\n68\n00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:45.239\nlet's think about this for a second,\nMicrosoft will only support teams of two.\n\n69\n00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.262\nIt doesn't mean you can't have more teams,\nand like Wes and\n\n70\n00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:52.174\nI had mentioned in the previous show,\nteaming has been around for a long time,\n\n71\n00:03:52.174 --> 00:03:53.800\nand other vendors do offer it.\n\n72\n00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.772\nSo it's not that it's not possible, it's\njust that you're going to be on your own\n\n73\n00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:03.410\nif you do decide to set up multiple\nadapters inside of that actually machine.\n\n74\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.393\nThat rule doesn't apply\nto the actual hardware.\n\n75\n00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:08.815\nSo if I remove Hyper-V from the equation,\nand\n\n76\n00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:13.816\nI'm just doing NIC Teaming on a hardware,\na box with my equipment,\n\n77\n00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:18.300\nmy physical equipment,\nI can have up to 32 within a team.\n\n78\n00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.566\nSo just kind of be aware\nof the differences there.\n\n79\n00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:24.499\nBut I've created some adapters here.\n\n80\n00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:28.546\nI've got two that we're gonna be working\nwith, and I'll just show you real quick,\n\n81\n00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:31.852\nyou wanna make sure that you're\ndealing with static IP addresses for\n\n82\n00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:34.820\nthese adapters,\notherwise things could get a little fuzzy.\n\n83\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.632\nSo what I'm going to do here is, let's\npull up PowerShell inside of our machine,\n\n84\n00:04:39.632 --> 00:04:41.885\nand let me just change the font for us.\n\n85\n00:04:45.044 --> 00:04:49.906\nLet's go to 20,\n\n86\n00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:53.902\nand change that screen text to white.\n\n87\n00:04:53.902 --> 00:04:57.118\nIt just makes it a little\nbit easier to read.\n\n88\n00:04:57.118 --> 00:05:04.530\nAnd then also I'll just back\non out whoops not CS, CD.\n\n89\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.497\nOkay.\n\n90\n00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:12.274\nJust clearing my screen, sorry it's\na little like OCD going on here,\n\n91\n00:05:12.274 --> 00:05:15.554\nnot totally, but just like to\nhave it nice and clean for you.\n\n92\n00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:20.362\nOkay, so what I'm gonna be\nusing here is my netsh command.\n\n93\n00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.443\nSo netsh has been around for\na long time, and\n\n94\n00:05:23.443 --> 00:05:26.620\nthis is gonna allow me\nto set a static IP here.\n\n95\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.880\nSo I'm gonna set my interface, and\nthis is going to be ip set address, and\n\n96\n00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.050\nthe adapter that I'm gonna be setting this\naddress for, is going to be \"Ethernet2\",\n\n97\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.420\nand because there's a space here,\nI'm using these quotation marks.\n\n98\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.040\nIf you have the name of your adapter\nwithout quotation, or without a space,\n\n99\n00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.902\nthen you don't have to use the quotation\nmarks, but I'm just letting you know.\n\n100\n00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:57.890\nAll right, so my static IP address here,\nwhat do they want us to use?\n\n101\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.372\nThis is gonna be 192.168.0.30\nwith a Class C subnet mask.\n\n102\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.740\nI'll go ahead and hit Enter here.\n\n103\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.354\nNow, we don't have any kind of glaring\nremarks saying good job, you did it.\n\n104\n00:06:12.354 --> 00:06:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the love/hate\nrelationship I have with PowerShell.\n\n105\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.819\nThey're, Cherokee, very anti-climactic\nwhen you do something right, but\n\n106\n00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.540\nlike you mentioned, always gonna let\nyou know when you did something wrong.\n\n107\n00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.329\nNow, since we don't really get much\noutput after you finish the command,\n\n108\n00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:26.270\nis there a way that we can verify that?\n\n109\n00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.167\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthere's a couple different ways, and\n\n110\n00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:30.140\nit really just depends on your preference.\n\n111\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.720\nSo if you're already in PowerShell,\nwhich I am, I'll just go ahead and\n\n112\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.350\nremember ipconfig will work\nhere in this interface as well.\n\n113\n00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.745\nSo I'll just take a look at\nall of my settings here, and\n\n114\n00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:44.432\nlet me kind of scroll down for us.\n\n115\n00:06:44.432 --> 00:06:45.911\nWe've got a lot of different information.\n\n116\n00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:46.760\nI'm trying to see.\n\n117\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.586\nIt should put it up here towards the top,\nbut let me just check on that.\n\n118\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.962\nWe can check here, again in PowerShell,\njust by verifying that IP address,\n\n119\n00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:02.558\nand I can see that right now that it did\ngo ahead and take care of our ethernet\n\n120\n00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:07.526\nadapter, so this is Ethernet 2, and\nif we take a look right here it says, hey,\n\n121\n00:07:07.526 --> 00:07:11.940\nokay this IP address it is preferred,\nso we have set that statically.\n\n122\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:17.380\nBut let me minimize PowerShell, and\nlet's see that through the GUI.\n\n123\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.634\nIf I go ahead and open up my network and\nsharing center here,\n\n124\n00:07:21.634 --> 00:07:25.208\nunder change adapter settings,\nover on my left,\n\n125\n00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:29.484\nI can see the two adapters that\nI told you that I'd created.\n\n126\n00:07:29.484 --> 00:07:33.792\nWe have one that's just called\nEthernet and one here with Ethernet 2.\n\n127\n00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:36.952\nSo, you could go right into\nthe Properties, right-click,\n\n128\n00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:41.050\nselect Properties, and then you can see\nyour IP configuration settings here.\n\n129\n00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.580\nSo, to verify my IPv4 settings,\nI would highlight that.\n\n130\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.884\nMake sure you click on the actual words,\nand not inside that check box,\n\n131\n00:07:49.884 --> 00:07:54.132\nbecause it'll clear that out, and\nnot [LAUGH] use IPv4 if you do that.\n\n132\n00:07:54.132 --> 00:07:57.655\nSo we'll hit Properties, and\nyou can see that, hey look,\n\n133\n00:07:57.655 --> 00:08:00.486\nthere's the IP address\nthat we had specified.\n\n134\n00:08:00.486 --> 00:08:03.017\nAnd I'll zoom in so you can see that,\n\n135\n00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:08.090\nthe 192.168.0.30 as well as\nthat Class C subnet mask there.\n\n136\n00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.200\nSo just a couple of different ways which\nis also cool because I want you to kind of\n\n137\n00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.080\nnotice that I at this point in time, prior\nto creating this team, I'm able to go into\n\n138\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.670\neach one of those adapters individually,\nand look at those settings, my IP settings\n\n139\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.650\nbut just keep in mind we'll look at\nthat afterwards and see how it compares.\n\n140\n00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.510\nAnd I'll, and I'm on out of here.\n\n141\n00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.770\nWe'll zoom out and go ahead and\nzoom in a little bit more,\n\n142\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:41.610\nwe'll raise that part, and\nthen close out of here.\n\n143\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.490\nAll right.\n\n144\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.870\nSo what do we want to do next?\n\n145\n00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.735\nSo in PowerShell, so\nI'll pull that back up again.\n\n146\n00:08:55.378 --> 00:08:57.840\nAnd I'll just clear this screen,\nwe've got a lot going on here.\n\n147\n00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.650\nI can launch and begin initiate this\nteam a couple of different ways.\n\n148\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.560\nIf I just go ahead and type in LBFO,\nwhich remember how we said that\n\n149\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.630\nthis term team has a number of different\nnames you may be hearing this called,\n\n150\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.510\nbut here, it's kinda funny.\n\n151\n00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.640\nThey use LBFO, which stands for\nLoad Balancing Fail Over option, and\n\n152\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.000\nso just remember that this is not the only\nredundancy option, as a matter of fact\n\n153\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.080\nMicrosoft has really great options\nwhen it comes to virtualization for\n\n154\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.440\nredundancy and fail over such as creating\nthose clusters or live migrations.\n\n155\n00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.240\nSo this is just one way that I'm\nshowing you how to go ahead and\n\n156\n00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.580\nincrease redundancy here.\n\n157\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.860\nSo the commandlet is actually\nlbfoadmin and you can hit that, and\n\n158\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.380\nit'll go ahead and pull up this\ninterface where we can configure it.\n\n159\n00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.005\nLet me close out of here,\nminimize PowerShell, and\n\n160\n00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.585\nshow you another way we can get there.\n\n161\n00:09:56.585 --> 00:10:01.855\nNow because I'm creating,\nI'm actually logged into plabdm01,\n\n162\n00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:05.655\nthat's the machine I'm gonna\nbe creating this team on.\n\n163\n00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:10.512\nBut if I I were managing remotely and\nI had multiple servers, I could set this\n\n164\n00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:13.922\nup remotely, but for right now I'm\njust gonna click on Local server,\n\n165\n00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:18.432\nbecause if I were managing remotely or\nI had different servers listed here,\n\n166\n00:10:18.432 --> 00:10:21.842\nI'd click on All servers and\nthen just select the appropriate one.\n\n167\n00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.530\nBut, because I'm working here locally let\nme zoom in so that you guys can see this.\n\n168\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.100\nUnder the property section,\nthis pane right here in the center for\n\n169\n00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.540\nthat particular machine,\nyou can see Properties for PLABDML1.\n\n170\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:43.350\nNotice next to NIC team I have a blue\nlink here that will allow me to click it.\n\n171\n00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.350\nAnd you can see that it's\ncurrently set at being disabled.\n\n172\n00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.850\nSo if I click on that this is going\nto be popping up that same window.\n\n173\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.290\nSo a couple different ways to get there.\n\n174\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.120\nBut what we're going to be doing\nright here, is creating that team.\n\n175\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.070\nAnd it's actually not too\nterribly difficult to do so.\n\n176\n00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.009\nIt's pretty easy.\n\n177\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:06.740\nOn the left hand side,\nyou see a pane for a window here,\n\n178\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.660\nnot a separate window, but\na pane within this window for\n\n179\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.480\na teaming configuration, if I had\nmultiple teams, they would be noted here.\n\n180\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.900\nI don't have any teams yet,\nbut, you can see that I do have\n\n181\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.850\nboth of those adapters that I had\njust showed you from the Network and\n\n182\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.950\nSharing Center, and they're listed here.\n\n183\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.170\nWe have Ethernet and Ethernet2.\n\n184\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.880\nSo if you were to, couple of different\nways you could initiate the development of\n\n185\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.030\nthis team here, you could go ahead and\nfrom this dropdown menu,\n\n186\n00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.428\nthis action menu here,\nselect new team from that team section.\n\n187\n00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:41.680\nAlternatively you could go ahead and\nconfigure,\n\n188\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.680\nlet me see, I think you can\ncreate a new team over here.\n\n189\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.610\nI know you can right click.\n\n190\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.980\nLet's see.\nIt's getting a little jumpy.\n\n191\n00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.280\nLet me go back up.\n\n192\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.250\nI've lost my Window, there it is.\n\n193\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.860\nAnd you can see that little icon\ndown here, I think you can see it.\n\n194\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.700\nIt's like a physical server with two nicks\n\n195\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.400\nkind of sticking out\nthat little icon there.\n\n196\n00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.750\nSo that's just where it\nkind of get out of hand.\n\n197\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.250\nAll right.\n\n198\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.200\nSo if we select tasks and\nit keeps doing that for me jumping down.\n\n199\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.920\nOkay so we can't select it here, but\none more way that you could do that and\n\n200\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.200\nMicrosoft likes to give us different ways\nis you could just right click on top of\n\n201\n00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.400\none of those adapters to go ahead and\nselect Add to team.\n\n202\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.170\nI don't have a team yet, so it's gonna\ngo ahead and pull this window up for\n\n203\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.840\nme to go ahead and\nspecify that information.\n\n204\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.570\nSo for this particular demonstration,\nlet's see here.\n\n205\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:40.870\nThe name of my team is going to be\nPLAB and this is going to be DM01.\n\n206\n00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.070\nWe'll put a dash and\nthen we'll also name it Nick Team.\n\n207\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.680\nSo that will be the full name, and you do\nwant to make sure it does make sense so\n\n208\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.300\nyou know if you were managing\nmultiple servers and\n\n209\n00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.160\nmultiple teams, just some kind of logical\nway for you to identify that easily.\n\n210\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.490\nNow remember I can't create a team\nif I only have one adapter set,\n\n211\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.990\nthat just doesn't even make sense, so\nyou need to have at least two adapters.\n\n212\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.710\nAnd remember, Microsoft will\nsupport adapters of up to two.\n\n213\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.940\nSo I have both of those adapters set here.\n\n214\n00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.360\nNow, this is where, I think the majority\nof your time may be spent researching.\n\n215\n00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.690\nI showed you in the last episode a link\nto a Microsoft word document that\n\n216\n00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:30.900\nMicrosoft will they will outline\ndifferent configurations and\n\n217\n00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:35.734\nways that you can mix those\nconfigurations to optimize your use for\n\n218\n00:13:35.734 --> 00:13:40.380\nthat especially when it comes to looking\nat those algorithms for load balancing.\n\n219\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.770\nSo let me just go ahead and\nexpand this out for\n\n220\n00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.560\nour additional properties here,\nand cover each one of these.\n\n221\n00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.030\nNow, you'll see here switch independent,\n\n222\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.460\nby default,\nwe spoke about this in our diagram, right?\n\n223\n00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.400\nAnd we talked about the logic behind why\nor why you wouldn't want to go ahead and\n\n224\n00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.730\nset that up.\n\n225\n00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.390\nNow, Microsoft kind of [LAUGH]\ntakes the guess work out of it for\n\n226\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.620\nus here within the graphical\nuser interface and I just tried\n\n227\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.540\nto click on that dropdown error you\nguys saw kind of like moving over.\n\n228\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.280\nIt didn't let, nothing happened.\n\n229\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.780\nSo, here in the GUI,\nit says you know what?\n\n230\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.900\nSwitch independent, that's the way to go.\n\n231\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.100\nWe're gonna go ahead and select this for\nyou, for my teaming mode as well\n\n232\n00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.720\nas my load balancing mode is\nalso set here for my default.\n\n233\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:35.000\nSo if I were configuring NIC teaming in\nthe GUI just with hardware and without\n\n234\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.310\nvirtualization, I would have three options\nfor each one of these settings here.\n\n235\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.230\nSo let's talk about that for a second\nbecause it's not impossible to use, but\n\n236\n00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.870\nit is preferred here\nwithin this initiation.\n\n237\n00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.680\nAnd I'll show you where it\ndiffers when you're setting it up\n\n238\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.500\nthrough PowerShell as well.\n\n239\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.880\nSo when we look at our teaming modes,\nagain we said our switch independent,\n\n240\n00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.740\nthat one was our default there, and\n\n241\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:03.570\nremember that there's no configuration\nthat needs to be done on the hardware.\n\n242\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.860\nSo on the actual switch and\non the computer, the adapter itself.\n\n243\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.270\nSo this is all done here\nin the operating system.\n\n244\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.110\nSo that's definitely a plus\nas to why it's chose for\n\n245\n00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.930\nthe default here in addition\nto having that redundancy.\n\n246\n00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.020\nNow, the other two options that aren't\nnoted here are both switch-dependent\n\n247\n00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:24.850\nmodes.\n\n248\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.830\nSo that's going to be our static teaming,\nwhich, you have to statically configure\n\n249\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:36.250\nthat switch usually, but on a port\nbasis to that particular TCP flow.\n\n250\n00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.770\nAnd then you also have that lack P\nconfiguration that we mentioned as well.\n\n251\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.670\nSo with lack P, it's going to be\ndynamically identifying those links, and\n\n252\n00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.972\nthe switch, again,\nhas to be configured as well.\n\n253\n00:15:48.972 --> 00:15:51.782\nSo we don't see those options here,\n\n254\n00:15:51.782 --> 00:15:56.780\njust know that they do exist and\nalso for our load balancing mode.\n\n255\n00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.847\nAnd if you think about that,\nit kind of makes sense because, let's say,\n\n256\n00:16:01.847 --> 00:16:06.960\nI'm creating a team for that aggregation,\nthat increased bandwidth.\n\n257\n00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.830\nSo thinking about that traffic coming in\nand the operating system's like, okay,\n\n258\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.260\nso where do I send this packet?\n\n259\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.350\nAnd where do I send that packet?\n\n260\n00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:21.962\nSo it makes sense to take time and\nunderstand why you're gonna be using this.\n\n261\n00:16:21.962 --> 00:16:25.800\nHow you're gonna be using this\nconfiguration, for example, HyperV.\n\n262\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.420\nEach virtual machine NIC,\nVM NICnet has it's own MAC address.\n\n263\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.420\nSo the MAC address is actually gonna\nbe the identifying factor here\n\n264\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.160\nto establish those flows.\n\n265\n00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.720\nAnd When you take a look at something like\naddress hash, which is what we see here,\n\n266\n00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.140\nthe default, address hash is\ngoing to be taking information.\n\n267\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.610\nInformation such as IP address,\nsource, and or destination.\n\n268\n00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.490\nAnd, mAC addresses.\n\n269\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.340\nSo they take all that info, they go ahead\nand if you're familiar with hashes and\n\n270\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.410\nhow they worked,\n\n271\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.510\na hash is going to be like an algorithm\nthat is applied to a string of data.\n\n272\n00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.140\nAnd then that output should be unique.\n\n273\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.830\nSo, when the system\nlooks at an identifier,\n\n274\n00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.620\nit's assuming that that hash is unique\nbecause well, hashes should be.\n\n275\n00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:18.760\nAnd then it knowS which virtual machine\nto actually send that information to.\n\n276\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:24.040\nSo what happens is it creates a static\naffinity from that virtual machine\n\n277\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.950\nbased upon the default here is going to\nbe the TCP ports and the IP addresses.\n\n278\n00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.060\nBut that can be configured\nslightly differently,\n\n279\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.600\nlike I said if you have a reason\nwhy you can change that as well.\n\n280\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.997\nBut that's the default\njust to let you know.\n\n281\n00:17:35.997 --> 00:17:39.431\nAnd then lastly we have this\noption called Dynamic and\n\n282\n00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:43.475\nagain you can't see it here in\nthe graphical user interface but\n\n283\n00:17:43.475 --> 00:17:47.670\nwhen we create our machine or\nwhen we create a team in PowerShell,\n\n284\n00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:52.610\nthat's actually the default if\nwe don't specify anything other.\n\n285\n00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.514\nAnd dynamic is a feature,\n\n286\n00:17:54.514 --> 00:17:59.371\nit's going to be a load balancing\nmode new to Server 2012 R2.\n\n287\n00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:02.521\nAnd it's a little bit\ndifferent the way it works,\n\n288\n00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:06.429\nso it actually the best of both\nof those the two other options.\n\n289\n00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:11.402\nSo for instance inbound traffic is\ngoing to look at that information based\n\n290\n00:18:11.402 --> 00:18:15.651\nupon like we spoke about like\nthe IPv4 using the MAC address for\n\n291\n00:18:15.651 --> 00:18:17.750\nthe inbound communications.\n\n292\n00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.250\nBut for\noutbound it actually uses the hash.\n\n293\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.815\nSo it's kind of different\nthe way that that works there.\n\n294\n00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:27.980\nAnd then it also leverages\na new concept called flowlets.\n\n295\n00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.572\nAnd flowlets are kind of logical\nways like someone, Wes and I,\n\n296\n00:18:33.572 --> 00:18:38.005\nwhen we're talking and\nwe have these kind of pauses or breaks.\n\n297\n00:18:38.005 --> 00:18:41.604\nOr if you're writing a story or\nan essay, and\n\n298\n00:18:41.604 --> 00:18:45.440\nyou could use a period or\nmaybe even a comma.\n\n299\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.320\nJust some kind of logical\ndivision like hey,\n\n300\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.306\nmy thought is complete\nI'm rounding this out.\n\n301\n00:18:49.306 --> 00:18:53.446\nSo the flowlets act as a logical\ndivision of packet for\n\n302\n00:18:53.446 --> 00:18:58.599\ntransmission so that it really\nhelps with our packet placement and\n\n303\n00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:01.554\nthey come in the correct order there.\n\n304\n00:19:01.554 --> 00:19:05.193\nSo I'm evenly distributing and\nload balancing and\n\n305\n00:19:05.193 --> 00:19:08.753\nlooking at hey,\nwhere's the good cut off point?\n\n306\n00:19:08.753 --> 00:19:13.137\nSo that's what those flowlets allow us to\ndo with our dynamic load balancing mode.\n\n307\n00:19:13.137 --> 00:19:19.104\nAlso, I do wanna point out that our\nstandby adapter mode is set for\n\n308\n00:19:19.104 --> 00:19:22.262\nall adapters active, all right?\n\n309\n00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:25.357\nSo if we think about that for\na second, recall that Wes and I,\n\n310\n00:19:25.357 --> 00:19:28.410\nwe had discussed this when we\nwere looking at that diagram.\n\n311\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:34.060\nAnd we said, okay so, what if we\nwant to have a thicker pipe there?\n\n312\n00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:34.933\nWe want to have more bandwidth.\n\n313\n00:19:34.933 --> 00:19:38.144\nAre we gonna be using all of\nthose adapters in that team, or\n\n314\n00:19:38.144 --> 00:19:41.810\ndo we want to have one on standby\nto provide that stability?\n\n315\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:46.380\nSo, just knowing the defaults may help\nyou whenever you're creating them\n\n316\n00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.360\njust to kinda keep that in mind.\n\n317\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.592\nAnd really, that's it there.\n\n318\n00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:52.937\nHold on, I am bumping around.\n\n319\n00:19:52.937 --> 00:19:54.018\nLet me get back into that window.\n\n320\n00:19:54.018 --> 00:19:57.579\nUse this scroll bar, there we go.\n\n321\n00:19:57.579 --> 00:19:59.187\nIt's a little difficult.\n\n322\n00:19:59.187 --> 00:20:06.232\nLet me zoom out so\nwe can get to that to see, Let's see here.\n\n323\n00:20:06.232 --> 00:20:07.773\nI'm moving things around.\n\n324\n00:20:11.055 --> 00:20:11.823\nThat's really it though.\n\n325\n00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:13.365\nWe're gonna hit OK.\n\n326\n00:20:13.365 --> 00:20:17.573\nNow, let me just kind\nof note something here.\n\n327\n00:20:17.573 --> 00:20:20.442\nYou'll see it scrolling there at the top,\n\n328\n00:20:20.442 --> 00:20:23.560\ndoesn't take too long to go ahead and\ncreate.\n\n329\n00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.670\nYou do wanna be mindful of network\nconnectivity when you are setting up your\n\n330\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.020\nteam for obvious reason here.\n\n331\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.348\nYou will have some disconnects.\n\n332\n00:20:35.348 --> 00:20:39.535\nYou saw how quick it was here so\nit might not be too disruptive.\n\n333\n00:20:39.535 --> 00:20:43.169\nBut it's always a good idea to kind of\nperform this during our maintenance\n\n334\n00:20:43.169 --> 00:20:45.116\nwindows, our downtime, if you will.\n\n335\n00:20:45.116 --> 00:20:47.970\nAnother thing that's kind of interesting.\n\n336\n00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.579\nAnd a lot of different configurations that\nwe see in Microsoft environments, and\n\n337\n00:20:52.579 --> 00:20:54.046\nwe see this more and more,\n\n338\n00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:58.217\nlike we had spoke about before as our\noperating systems are progressing.\n\n339\n00:20:58.217 --> 00:21:02.736\nWe're able to change more things in\nreal time and a lot more hot swappable\n\n340\n00:21:02.736 --> 00:21:06.884\ncomponents, but if you go ahead and\nchange your NIC team and name,\n\n341\n00:21:06.884 --> 00:21:11.182\neither through PowerShell, or\nthe GUI, you'll also see a moment of\n\n342\n00:21:11.182 --> 00:21:15.739\ndisruption there, so it's just kind\nof nice to know that ahead of time.\n\n343\n00:21:15.739 --> 00:21:20.395\nNow, I do see that particular\nconfiguration is down here\n\n344\n00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:22.930\nfrom the notifications.\n\n345\n00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.650\nNumber one, because I'm working\nin a lab environment and\n\n346\n00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.430\nI don't have those physical adapters.\n\n347\n00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:32.420\nI only have one physical adapter\nin this lab environment, but\n\n348\n00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.610\nthat's how you would go ahead and\nset it up.\n\n349\n00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.110\nOne thing I do wanna show you here,\nlet's go back,\n\n350\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.240\nopen our Network and Sharing Center so\nyou can kind of associate that from\n\n351\n00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.330\na graphical perspective of\nwhat this looks like for us.\n\n352\n00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.860\nI've just changed the view here,\nbut you can see,\n\n353\n00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.410\nthese are the adapters that I have, I had\ndone that when we were fumbling through\n\n354\n00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:57.060\nall the site resizing here, but\nI've got my Ethernet and Ethernet 2.\n\n355\n00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.890\nAnd now you can see my team.\n\n356\n00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.430\nAnd notice that there's a red x here.\n\n357\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.240\nOkay, that's stated as being down.\n\n358\n00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.730\nSo if I just right-click on that and\nselect Disable.\n\n359\n00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:11.957\nGive it a second.\n\n360\n00:22:13.474 --> 00:22:16.690\nOnce I re-enable that,\nit will go ahead and enable that team.\n\n361\n00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.290\nSo right click, Enable, all right?\n\n362\n00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.207\nAnd you can see here, it happened\nreally quick, but it said enabling.\n\n363\n00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:29.114\nSo now that that is enabled,\nsomething else I wanna show you.\n\n364\n00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:33.744\nRemember we set the IP address\nof Ethernet 2 as static, so\n\n365\n00:22:33.744 --> 00:22:36.770\nlet's check that real quick.\n\n366\n00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:42.381\nIf we go into properties, Notice\n\n367\n00:22:42.381 --> 00:22:46.960\nhere how nothing is bound to\nthose IP protocols, right?\n\n368\n00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.194\nSo what's happening?\n\n369\n00:22:48.194 --> 00:22:51.754\nWell now this is\nessentially what happened.\n\n370\n00:22:51.754 --> 00:22:56.198\nWe went from having a VM NIC, right?\n\n371\n00:22:56.198 --> 00:23:02.550\nWell two VM NICs, Ethernet and\nEthernet 2, to now having a T NIC.\n\n372\n00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.280\nSo if you recall that diagram that\nwe had looked at in the last show\n\n373\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.130\nI said that's something that changes\nwhenever we create our teams.\n\n374\n00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.553\nSo, if we look at the properties here for\nour actual t-nick,\n\n375\n00:23:15.553 --> 00:23:17.945\nokay and let me just scroll down.\n\n376\n00:23:21.561 --> 00:23:22.307\nWe'll get there.\n\n377\n00:23:22.307 --> 00:23:30.862\nWe can see here that our actual IP\nProperties are bound here to our T NIC's.\n\n378\n00:23:30.862 --> 00:23:33.838\nSo this is where that interface,\nthat adaptor is,\n\n379\n00:23:33.838 --> 00:23:36.688\nthat relationship is transpiring,\nall right?\n\n380\n00:23:36.688 --> 00:23:39.551\nSo hopefully that makes sense for you,\n\n381\n00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:43.818\ntaking a look at the different\nterms that may be new to you.\n\n382\n00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:48.986\nAll right, now that we've\ncreated our team let's do this.\n\n383\n00:23:48.986 --> 00:23:52.926\nLet's get into PowerShell and\nsee what we can do because PowerShell is\n\n384\n00:23:52.926 --> 00:23:56.751\ndefinitely gonna be something that\nwe need to know moving forward.\n\n385\n00:23:56.751 --> 00:24:01.434\nI'm just backing out of the multiple\nwindows that I have opened here.\n\n386\n00:24:01.434 --> 00:24:08.580\nAnd you'll need to refresh or close out\nof and relaunch that NIC Teaming window.\n\n387\n00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.390\nIf you do disable and re-enable\nthat to get that most up to date,\n\n388\n00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:13.190\nI'm sure you know that.\n\n389\n00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.340\nBut I'm just kind of reminding you.\n\n390\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.740\nSo let's go ahead and pull up PowerShell.\n\n391\n00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:22.370\nAnd take a look at what we can do here,\nlet me clear this out.\n\n392\n00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.950\nThis is from what we had earlier,\nso I just clear the screen.\n\n393\n00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.952\nNow, the first thing I\nwant to do is run my\n\n394\n00:24:30.952 --> 00:24:38.690\nGet-NetAdapter to take\na look at what we just saw.\n\n395\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.322\nThis is essentially the exact same\ninformation that we were looking at there\n\n396\n00:24:42.322 --> 00:24:45.566\nin the graphical user interface\nunder Network and Sharing center.\n\n397\n00:24:45.566 --> 00:24:50.102\nBut I just wanna show you, look,\nwe have those two adapters, Ethernet and\n\n398\n00:24:50.102 --> 00:24:53.740\nEthernet 2,\nas well as our NICTeam that we had named.\n\n399\n00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.360\nAnd it puts it in a table type format, so\n\n400\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.480\nyou can see well, I say you can see but\neventually we'll get there.\n\n401\n00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.830\nIf I were to go ahead and scroll over\nyou could see information such as\n\n402\n00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:09.840\nyour speeds and things like that if,\nthat interface index as well.\n\n403\n00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.740\nSo you could also use that as an\nidentifier to set certain configurations.\n\n404\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:17.200\nAnd because of the status of this\nbeing that virtual environment,\n\n405\n00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.500\nyou'll notice that it says disconnected,\nbut that's okay for now.\n\n406\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.680\nThose are the steps of how to go ahead and\ncreate it, and\n\n407\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.690\nthat's what we're gonna be looking at.\n\n408\n00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:30.660\nAll right, let's get back into\nposition here to actually,\n\n409\n00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.510\nlet me just clear the screen again.\n\n410\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.070\nWe'll create that team.\n\n411\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.910\nAll right, in order to create a new theme,\n\n412\n00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:41.880\nwe're gonna be using\nthe cmdlet New-NetLBFOTeam and\n\n413\n00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.220\nwe can tab through there to make\nsure I'm spelling things correctly.\n\n414\n00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.410\nNow let's specify the name that we\nwant to call this particular team.\n\n415\n00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.474\nWe'll go ahead and call this one DemoTeam.\n\n416\n00:25:53.474 --> 00:25:58.050\nAnd the next thing that we need\nto add is well, our team members.\n\n417\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:02.450\nSo the team members we have, and\nwe just have to check on for\n\n418\n00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:06.325\nthe words members because my brain\nalways want to spell in members,\n\n419\n00:26:06.325 --> 00:26:09.830\n[LAUGH] must be a Southern thing,\nI don't know.\n\n420\n00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:14.810\nAnyway, so my team members for\nthis particular team are going to be,\n\n421\n00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.020\nwell we have Ethernet,\nthat was the first one.\n\n422\n00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.650\nAnd because Ethernet like I said,\none word, I don't have a space there,\n\n423\n00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.900\nyou don't have to put\nthe quotation marks around it, but\n\n424\n00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.710\nI will need to do that here for\nEthernet 2, end quotation.\n\n425\n00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.360\nAnd I'm kind of wrapping\nup this screen here,\n\n426\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.970\nI'll go ahead and\nscroll over here to show you that.\n\n427\n00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.820\nNow, unintentionally omitting\nparticular parameters\n\n428\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.220\nfrom the syntax to go ahead show\nyou what those defaults are.\n\n429\n00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.230\nSo if I just specified the name and\n\n430\n00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.750\nthe members of a team here in PowerShell,\nlet's see what happens.\n\n431\n00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:53.110\nOkay, so again I didn't use that\nconfirmed parameter, so it's asking me,\n\n432\n00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.140\ndo you want to do this?\n\n433\n00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:00.670\nSo I'll say, Yes I do, and we look at\nthose default configuration options here,\n\n434\n00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:06.750\nthe default configurations that\nwe get if we don't specify.\n\n435\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.754\nSo I see the two variables\nthat I did set there for\n\n436\n00:27:10.754 --> 00:27:14.920\nmy DemoTeam, Ethernet 2 and Ethernet.\n\n437\n00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.310\nBut notice here for my TeamingMode,\nit's still SwitchIndependent.\n\n438\n00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:24.480\nThat's the same option that we saw within\nthe graphical user interface here because\n\n439\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.260\nagain, that just makes the most sense\nusing an inter-virtualized environment.\n\n440\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:34.250\nBut notice for our LoadBalancingAlgorithm,\nby not specifying, remember that\n\n441\n00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.730\nour address hash was a default\nwithin the graphical user interface.\n\n442\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.690\nBut now it's dynamic for that default.\n\n443\n00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.320\nSo just kinda pointing that out for you.\n\n444\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.160\nAnd the other default that's not\nreally listed in this output here,\n\n445\n00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.250\nbut if I were to check and\nindividually on a specific team member,\n\n446\n00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:58.747\nI could do that by using the Get- NetLBFO,\n\n447\n00:27:58.747 --> 00:28:01.660\nand we'll tab through, no.\n\n448\n00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:06.236\nThat's because I didn't\nspell things correctly,\n\n449\n00:28:06.236 --> 00:28:09.884\nit sure does help, NetLBFOTeamMember.\n\n450\n00:28:09.884 --> 00:28:11.949\nNot team, TeamMember.\n\n451\n00:28:11.949 --> 00:28:16.295\nAnd here, again if I omit the actual\nname of the team member, so\n\n452\n00:28:16.295 --> 00:28:19.170\nI could specify Ethernet or Ethernet 2.\n\n453\n00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.692\nIf I leave that blank and just hit Enter,\nthis is gonna show me the information for\n\n454\n00:28:23.692 --> 00:28:25.480\nboth of those team members.\n\n455\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:31.390\nSo I can see that here,\nfirst we have Ethernet 2 and if you recall\n\n456\n00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:35.630\nthat configuration we were talking about\nwith active active or active passive.\n\n457\n00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:41.020\nIn this configuration I can see that\nEthernet 2 is set for active, okay?\n\n458\n00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:46.830\nScrolling down, looking at Ethernet,\nEthernet is also active, right here.\n\n459\n00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:51.970\nSo if they're both active, that's going\nto be that active-active configuration.\n\n460\n00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.960\nLet me clear the screen and\nshow you how you can change that.\n\n461\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.850\nSo in order to set one into,\none adapter here,\n\n462\n00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.200\nto be in standby mode,\nwe would use the SET cmdlet.\n\n463\n00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.950\nSo I would say, Set-NetLBFO and\n\n464\n00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.370\nthen this is gonna be TeamMember.\n\n465\n00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.300\nAnd then you would specify\nthe actual team member name.\n\n466\n00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.970\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nuse that name parameter.\n\n467\n00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.520\nAgain here,\nthis one I'll use my quotations.\n\n468\n00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.639\nWe'll say Ethernet 2 and\n\n469\n00:29:28.639 --> 00:29:33.657\nthen we'll add the parameter here for\nadministrative mode.\n\n470\n00:29:36.489 --> 00:29:42.630\nThe administrative mode is going to\nbe standby, And we'll hit Enter.\n\n471\n00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:47.150\nAgain, not a whole lot, so in order\nto just verify real quick let's get\n\n472\n00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:52.190\nthat LBFOT member cmdlet\nto help us check that.\n\n473\n00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.790\nAnd you can see now for Ethernet 2,\n\n474\n00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.870\nthe administrative mode is\nnoted here with standby.\n\n475\n00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.390\nSo if you wanted to take\nadvantage of that active/passive,\n\n476\n00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.800\nthat's how you could\nhere within PowerShell.\n\n477\n00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.000\nBut, like I said,\n\n478\n00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.770\njust knowing the default so you're not\nconfiguring something incorrectly,\n\n479\n00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.400\nyou're assuming that it's a certain way\nbecause it was a certain way in the GUI.\n\n480\n00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.910\nBut PowerShell it's a little different and\nI just wanted to note that.\n\n481\n00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:22.590\nAnd that's how you create NICTeams\nhere within Virtual Machines.\n\n482\n00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, a lot of great information.\n\n483\n00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.360\nI know it took us a while to\nget through there cuz remember,\n\n484\n00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.060\nwe've got quite a few parts here.\n\n485\n00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.430\nKeep in mind, go back and\nwatch all those parts in totality.\n\n486\n00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.400\nCherokee, I think you did a great job,\nthank you as always for being here in\n\n487\n00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.560\nthe studios with us, and thank you to\nthe viewer for watching out there.\n\n488\n00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.200\nRemember, you can watch this episode and\nthousands of hours of additional content,\n\n489\n00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.310\nbut you'll have to jump over to our\ncourse library to take a benefit there.\n\n490\n00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.927\nUntil we see you again, signing off for\nITPro TV, I've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n491\n00:30:47.927 --> 00:30:48.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n492\n00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:50.625\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n493\n00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:56.645\n[MUSIC]\n\n494\n00:30:56.645 --> 00:30:59.592\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

00:00:08.225\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:12.226\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.226 --> 00:00:15.464\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:19.290\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.300\nMore specifically focusing\nin on exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.810\nAnd today, we're covering deploying and\nconfiguring DHCP servers.\n\n9\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.410\nAnd here to help us to understand\nthis process a bit better is gonna be\n\n10\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.470\nMiss Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.650\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me as always, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.810\nHow are you today?\n\n14\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.830\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine.\n\n15\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.560\nNow, Cherokee, as we begin and\n\n16\n00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.110\ntalk about the idea of DHCP,\nit is one of these main processes\n\n17\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.470\nthat we tend to have running in just\nabout every network that I've ever seen.\n\n18\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.960\nSo, it's a big part of our\nlives as system administrators.\n\n19\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.860\nSo, where are we gonna begin today?\n\n20\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, Ronnie, DHCP,\ndynamic host configuration protocol,\n\n21\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.770\nis a core network service,\nit's very important.\n\n22\n00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.835\nMicrosoft at this level assumes\nyou have some base knowledge.\n\n23\n00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:05.415\nSo let's just talk about that for\na moment,\n\n24\n00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:08.565\nsome things that we already\nknow about DHCP, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:11.360\nSo we should know at this\npoint what DHCP does.\n\n26\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.220\nDHCP provides information to\nmy clients on the network.\n\n27\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.670\nSo, for instance, mainly,\n\n28\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090\nprobably the most popular thing\nbeing those IP addresses.\n\n29\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.490\nIt can provide information\nsuch as the subnet mask.\n\n30\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.630\nIt can provide our default gateway,\nthe router IP address there.\n\n31\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.530\nBut that's not it.\n\n32\n00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.560\nIt can provide up to 50 different options.\n\n33\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.550\nWe may not use all those options.\n\n34\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.200\nUsually, those three\nare probably the most popular.\n\n35\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.130\nBut just knowing that our DHCP servers\ncan provide that information to our\n\n36\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.050\nclients on our network, so\nthat everyone's on the same page.\n\n37\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.480\nAnd they know where to\nobtain certain resources and\n\n38\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.720\nhow to communicate with each other.\n\n39\n00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.900\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee,\nthe advantage of this, though, and\n\n40\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.105\nthe reason why we want to emphasize\nthis is because of the D part of DHTP,\n\n41\n00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:00.770\nthe dynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n42\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.250\nWhich means that you and\nI don't have to manually do this.\n\n43\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.870\nSo, for example, Cherokee, one of the\nthings that I have actually dealt with on\n\n44\n00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.320\nnetwork are things like IP phones, right?\n\n45\n00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.890\nThe idea of using VOIP.\n\n46\n00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.040\nWell, when they get their configuration,\n\n47\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.100\nI actually have FTP server in which\nthe phone when I plug it in has to go and\n\n48\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.640\ntalk to the FTP server to bring down the\ninformation that needs to on that phone.\n\n49\n00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.140\nWell, if I had to do that for every\nsingle phone, wait for it to plug in and\n\n50\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.880\nthen manually have to go,\nall right, now go and\n\n51\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.700\nretrieve the files that\nit needs to do that?\n\n52\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.900\nWell, that would become a hefty, hefty\nprocess if every single phone needs that.\n\n53\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.080\nBut with DHCP, though, if we set it up and\nusing some of the options that\n\n54\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.970\nyou're talking about, Cherokee, it means I\njust plug in the phone and what happens?\n\n55\n00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.990\nIt does it for me, right?\n\n56\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean, could you imagine\ngoing to all of those different phones?\n\n57\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.010\nHow many employees have a VOIP\nphone sitting on their desk?\n\n58\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.690\nIn a lot of the environments, or\nin some environments, it may be more than\n\n59\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.960\nwhat you want to do with as far as walking\nto each one, and setting them manually.\n\n60\n00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.940\nAnd not only that, Ronnie, can you\nthink about how many typos we may have?\n\n61\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.002\nSo DHCP prevents a lot of those issues and\nthen automates things for us.\n\n62\n00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:11.117\nBut something to point out,\nthough, with that term, dynamic,\n\n63\n00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:15.767\nwe also must consider the fact\nthat DHCP does not only dole or\n\n64\n00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:17.633\nhand out dynamically.\n\n65\n00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.623\nBut we can also set static or\npermanent IP addresses,\n\n66\n00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:25.100\na couple different ways as well,\nand we'll talk about that also.\n\n67\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.258\nSo just talking about the different\nport numbers, remember,\n\n68\n00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:35.140\nwe used two different port numbers here,\na 67 server side, a 68 client side.\n\n69\n00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.370\nI'm trying to think, is there anything\nelse as far as just being base knowledge.\n\n70\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.010\nI guess we definitely just wanna touch\non that entire process of how our\n\n71\n00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.520\nclient would obtain this\ninformation as a refresher.\n\n72\n00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.468\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nmy screen and we'll do that here.\n\n73\n00:03:50.468 --> 00:03:54.030\nOkay, some of you may be\nfamiliar with this DORA process.\n\n74\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.690\nYou might have heard it being referenced\nin another method like the Rosa process or\n\n75\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.900\nsomething but it's pretty simple here.\n\n76\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.190\nI like the DORA because\nwho doesn't like DORA?\n\n77\n00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.310\nI mean, she's adorable and she's got\nher little friend Boots right here.\n\n78\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.214\nAnd I think it's kind of interesting\nbecause if you think about the predecessor\n\n79\n00:04:12.214 --> 00:04:14.568\nto DHCP with our Bootstrap protocol.\n\n80\n00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:16.951\nAnd Bootstrap protocol\nis similar to DHCP but\n\n81\n00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:20.161\nwe are gonna be using it\ndynamically in environments today.\n\n82\n00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:23.666\nBecause with Bootstrap protocol those,\n\n83\n00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:28.680\nthat information was handed\nout on a permanent type basis.\n\n84\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.568\nSo to certain situations we\nstill will be utilizing it, but\n\n85\n00:04:32.568 --> 00:04:37.485\nfor the majority of the time you're\ngonna be using our DHCP services here.\n\n86\n00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhat you're talking on that Bootstrap,\n\n87\n00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.447\nyou're just saying BOOTP, right?\n\n88\n00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.460\nThat's what you mean?\n&gt;&gt; BOOTP, yeah, Bootstrap protocol,\n\n89\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.790\nit's an older protocol there, yeah.\n\n90\n00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.700\nOkay, now for\nthe first step of this DORA process,\n\n91\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.020\nlet's think about what's happening here.\n\n92\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.610\nSo, this is the discover step and\nwe call it that because of\n\n93\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.810\nthe type of message that is being\ntransmitted during this step here.\n\n94\n00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.750\nAnd actually,\nlet me just pull up a browser here.\n\n95\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.270\nMicrosoft has a list, and\nI'll zoom in a bit so we can see this.\n\n96\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.337\nOf different types of messages\nthat are utilized for\n\n97\n00:05:12.337 --> 00:05:14.707\ncommunication with our DHCP servers here.\n\n98\n00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:19.794\nSo we're gonna talk about some of these\nthat are involved with that DORA process,\n\n99\n00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:24.658\nthat initiation, to obtain IP address\nlike our Discover, and our Offer, and\n\n100\n00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:25.559\nour Request.\n\n101\n00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.518\nWe have some DHCPDecline,\nacknowledgements, Nak, so\n\n102\n00:05:29.518 --> 00:05:32.487\nthis will be like a null\nacknowledgement or\n\n103\n00:05:32.487 --> 00:05:36.460\nnon-acknowledgement, DHCPRelease and\nDHCPInform.\n\n104\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.230\nSo just knowing that there are different\nmessages being utilized for\n\n105\n00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.220\nthe communication here between our nodes.\n\n106\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.990\nAll right, so let's go back to that\ndiagram and then look at step one here.\n\n107\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.210\nSo step one, here we have a client.\n\n108\n00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.480\nLet's just say this client right here, see\nhow they are sending out a transmission.\n\n109\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.190\nNow, this client doesn't know\nwho that DHCP server is yet\n\n110\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.640\nat this stage in the game.\n\n111\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.700\nSo what it does is it sends\nout a broadcast transmission.\n\n112\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.330\nSo everyone who in this diagram\nthey're connected to a switch here,\n\n113\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.705\neveryone's going to\nreceive that transmission.\n\n114\n00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:17.190\nAnd everyone is going to receive\nthat DHCPDISCOVER message.\n\n115\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.330\nSo that client will solicit an IP\naddress from a DHCP Server via\n\n116\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.160\nthe DHCPDISCOVER message.\n\n117\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.352\nThat's can be generating\nsome network traffic.\n\n118\n00:06:28.352 --> 00:06:30.220\nOur nodes or other workstations here,\n\n119\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.670\nthey're just gonna drop the transmission\nbecause they're not too concerned.\n\n120\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:41.010\nNow the other, let's say, these are all\nthree DHCP servers in my network.\n\n121\n00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.800\nThe other DHCP servers recognize\nthat type of communication,\n\n122\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.600\nso they're gonna respond as well.\n\n123\n00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.580\nSo the DHCP servers are gonna be\nsending a DHCP offer to the client,\n\n124\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.250\nso you'll notice here that they're sending\nthat unicast transmission to the client,\n\n125\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.390\nso that's offer.\n\n126\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:08.370\nNext, the client will choose\na DHCP offer message and\n\n127\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.840\nthen respond in a broadcast\ntransmission to that\n\n128\n00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.710\nDHCP server that it is selecting as well\nwith the IP address of that DHCP server.\n\n129\n00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.210\nSo the other DHCP servers\n\n130\n00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.070\nare not gonna be concerned with that\ncommunication anymore at this point.\n\n131\n00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.910\nSo now the request, so\nthis client says, yeah,\n\n132\n00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.990\nthat looks like a great IP address,\ncan I please have it?\n\n133\n00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.100\nSo that's where that request\ncomes into play here.\n\n134\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.830\n&gt;&gt; Now this is where\nit's very important for\n\n135\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.270\nus to understand, and\nas Cherokee has just pointed out,\n\n136\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.880\nwhen multiple DHCP offers, if you're\nlike me the first time you hear this.\n\n137\n00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.841\nWell, how does it know\nwhich one to take and\n\n138\n00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:53.062\nwhich one it decides to\nactually reject here?\n\n139\n00:07:53.062 --> 00:07:57.077\nWell, it really is based on a first come,\nfirst serve basis.\n\n140\n00:07:57.077 --> 00:08:02.247\nSo as that particular DHTPDISCOVER message\nis sent out And everybody receives it.\n\n141\n00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:07.035\nOnly the ones that are going to be\nable to answer with the DHCP offer,\n\n142\n00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:10.520\nthe O in that DORA process\nthere that you see.\n\n143\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.580\nWhichever one sends it out first, that's\nprobably gonna be the one that's gonna be,\n\n144\n00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.040\nessentially, received by that.\n\n145\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.880\nAnd the other two would just end up\nlosing out on that particular connection.\n\n146\n00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.439\nSo they're not gonna be\nupset too much by it.\n\n147\n00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:27.899\nBut they'll actually notice that the offer\nwill not end up getting through the rest\n\n148\n00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:30.969\nof the process, and\nthat's what will end up happening.\n\n149\n00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:35.125\n&gt;&gt; I like how you said upset,\nlike our devices having emotion here.\n\n150\n00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:36.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, you did use Dora, so.\n\n151\n00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.115\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, now let's take\na look at what happens next.\n\n152\n00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:44.905\nNow with our acknowledgment, so we're\ngonna receive some type of acknowledgment.\n\n153\n00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:49.840\nWhether is be successful or not,\nthat client will find out either way.\n\n154\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.300\nSo the server is then gonna\nsend a DHCP acknowledgement or\n\n155\n00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.180\na DHCPNAK to the client,\njust depending on the outcome.\n\n156\n00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.200\nNow if it does receive that\nNAK message saying, hey,\n\n157\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.950\nsomething didn't work out here, then it'll\ntry to reinstate the entire process and\n\n158\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.550\ngo through those steps again.\n\n159\n00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.014\nBecause if you think about it, remember,\n\n160\n00:09:11.014 --> 00:09:15.068\nWindows does provide APIPA address,\nall right?\n\n161\n00:09:15.068 --> 00:09:19.217\nSo this is gonna be an automatic\nIP private address,\n\n162\n00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:24.042\nmeaning it can only be used\nwithin your network, all right?\n\n163\n00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:30.208\nSo we're not gonna be able to traverse\na router with APIPA addresses and\n\n164\n00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:34.040\nthat's going to be in the 169.254.\n\n165\n00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.949\nWhatever, whatever range for your octet.\n\n166\n00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:39.106\nSo if you ran an IP config and\nyou received that kid of IP address,\n\n167\n00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:41.749\nthen you'll know ,hey,\nmaybe there's a problem.\n\n168\n00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:46.220\nI can't receive or\nobtain an IP address from my DHCP server.\n\n169\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.030\nSo that's our fallback mechanism\nthat Windows provides.\n\n170\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.344\nAnd in other operating systems,\nthey may call it a link local, but\n\n171\n00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.438\nthat's the terminology\nthat Microsoft uses.\n\n172\n00:09:57.438 --> 00:10:02.099\nAll right, now lastly that client will\nalso just utilize our ARP protocol\n\n173\n00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:04.879\nto verify that that IP\naddress is not in use,\n\n174\n00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:08.359\nso there aren't any IP\nconflicts within our network.\n\n175\n00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:13.376\nBut aside from that, we should be\ngood to go, but that is contingent\n\n176\n00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:19.580\nupon the lease duration that that DHCP\nserver has been configured to utilize.\n\n177\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.130\nSo by default, Microsoft sets that\nlease duration at eight days.\n\n178\n00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.560\nYou can change that.\n\n179\n00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.140\nWhy would you wanna change that?\n\n180\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.720\nWell, maybe you're in a situation or\nan environment where you have a high\n\n181\n00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.110\nturnover, a lot of people coming into\nyour environment and leaving rapidly.\n\n182\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.840\nMaybe you're at a coffee shop and\nyou see several 100 people a day.\n\n183\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.470\nWould you want to maintain and\nhold that IP address for\n\n184\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.111\neach one of those clients\nconnecting to your Wi-Fi?\n\n185\n00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.711\nWell, you're probably gonna\nrun out if that's the case,\n\n186\n00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:48.379\nif you haven't subnetted properly.\n\n187\n00:10:48.379 --> 00:10:52.637\nSo you would want to shorten\nyour DHCP lease duration for\n\n188\n00:10:52.637 --> 00:10:57.270\nthat type of example, but,\nby default, it's eight days.\n\n189\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.980\nThat works well for\na lot of organizations.\n\n190\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.950\nIf we can look at this calendar here,\nit's a little silly.\n\n191\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.110\nBut I wanted to break it down for\nyou in an easy to understand way.\n\n192\n00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.540\nBecause let's just say client boots up,\n\n193\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.050\ngoes through that Dora process here on\nMonday, January 2018, the 1st, right?\n\n194\n00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.522\nBecause that lease duration is eight days,\nand of course I can renew that lease if\n\n195\n00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:22.821\nneed be, there's a process that\nit goes through to do that.\n\n196\n00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:25.864\nSo when we get to 50%\nof my lease duration,\n\n197\n00:11:25.864 --> 00:11:29.237\nthe client will send out\na unicast transmission.\n\n198\n00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:34.977\nIt's a DCP request message to the current\nDHCP server that it's obtained\n\n199\n00:11:34.977 --> 00:11:41.192\nthat lease from, sending out a T1 timer\ntrying to say, hey, I'm alive here.\n\n200\n00:11:41.192 --> 00:11:44.499\nI'd like to go ahead and\nthen keep this particular IP address.\n\n201\n00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:51.330\nIf, for whatever reason,\nthat communication does not\n\n202\n00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.345\nhappen on the 4th,\nthere will be another attempt for\n\n203\n00:11:56.345 --> 00:12:03.494\na T2 timer to try to re-bind that IP\naddress to extend that lease duration.\n\n204\n00:12:03.494 --> 00:12:07.262\nLet's say the client has not booted up or\nlogged on,\n\n205\n00:12:07.262 --> 00:12:12.750\nthen that communication doesn't happen,\nso what will happen on the 8th?\n\n206\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:18.375\nThat IP address will be forfeited\nback into the available IP addresses\n\n207\n00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:24.398\nwithin that particular pool of IP\naddresses on my DHCP server, all right?\n\n208\n00:12:27.382 --> 00:12:28.930\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\n209\n00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.510\nWe need to think about our IP\naddressing scheme, all right?\n\n210\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.820\nIf you're not familiar with networking and\nyou don't know about subnetting,\n\n211\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.890\nMicrosoft assumes,\n\n212\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.850\nat this point in time, you already\nare comfortable with those concepts.\n\n213\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.330\nSo I would suggest you go back and\n\n214\n00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.060\nwatch some networking videos,\nif you haven't done so.\n\n215\n00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.560\nBecause the information that you obtain\nfrom subnetting is what we're gonna\n\n216\n00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.750\nbe using here as we move forward to\ncreate our scopes within the DHCP server.\n\n217\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.220\nSo, that's what we're gonna do next.\n\n218\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.250\nLet me pull up my lab here.\n\n219\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:11.430\nSo the first thing I wanna do\nis actually add the DHCP role.\n\n220\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.010\nBy default,\n\n221\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.500\nthis is not a role that's currently\ninstalled, so I wanna pull up PowerShell.\n\n222\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.390\nAnd let me just adjust these settings so\nwe can see the font here.\n\n223\n00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:25.281\nYou guys have already seen us walk through\nthe GUI a few times, so let's go ahead and\n\n224\n00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:27.769\nuse PowerShell to get this role installed.\n\n225\n00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:29.350\nIt's actually pretty simple here.\n\n226\n00:13:33.052 --> 00:13:33.832\nAll right,\n\n227\n00:13:33.832 --> 00:13:39.218\nthe commandlet that we're going to be\nusing is going to be add-windowsFeature.\n\n228\n00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.821\nAnd the feature name is DHCP.\n\n229\n00:13:45.821 --> 00:13:51.854\nWe wanna also include out management\ntools, so let's set that.\n\n230\n00:13:58.196 --> 00:13:59.125\n&gt;&gt; You misspelled management.\n\n231\n00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:03.765\n&gt;&gt; M-A-N-A-G-E-M-E-N-T,\n\n232\n00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:06.859\nthat would help there.\n\n233\n00:14:06.859 --> 00:14:11.494\nAll right, this is just gonna take a few\nmore minutes, shouldn't take too long.\n\n234\n00:14:11.494 --> 00:14:14.887\nBut what we need to do once we\nget this installation complete,\n\n235\n00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:17.020\nyou have a couple options.\n\n236\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:22.218\nBy default,\nwe'll need to authorize this DHCP server,\n\n237\n00:14:22.218 --> 00:14:29.279\nif it was installed, this role on\na server other, than a domain controller.\n\n238\n00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:35.999\nSo in this situation, I am installing\nthis DHCP server on a domain controller.\n\n239\n00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:38.890\nThere's not a need to authorize that.\n\n240\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.254\nIf I were installing it on another\nmachine, I would need to go ahead and\n\n241\n00:14:42.254 --> 00:14:44.431\nauthorize that with the domain controller.\n\n242\n00:14:44.431 --> 00:14:47.595\nSo the command for that, I'm not\ngonna hit Enter or anything here, but\n\n243\n00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.409\nI just wanna show you what that would be.\n\n244\n00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:53.741\nIt would be Add dhcpServerv4 and\n\n245\n00:14:53.741 --> 00:14:58.105\nthat would be, let's see here.\n\n246\n00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:01.810\n[COUGH]\nHold on,\n\n247\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.240\nI think I got the wrong commandlet.\n\n248\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.560\nDHCP server, yes, not version 4.\n\n249\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:11.320\nWe don't have to designate that to server,\nand that's going to be InDC.\n\n250\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.110\nSo that's that way to register it.\n\n251\n00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.598\nAnd then you could also\nspecify the IP address and, or\n\n252\n00:15:18.598 --> 00:15:21.850\nthe name for that particular server.\n\n253\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:25.900\nBut since this is a domain controller,\nI don't need to do that.\n\n254\n00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.250\nYou can see the outcome from\nour installation here was true.\n\n255\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.630\nI don't need to restart, so\nlet's just minimize this for right now.\n\n256\n00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.088\nI wanna show you what it looks like\nfrom the graphical user interface.\n\n257\n00:15:38.088 --> 00:15:42.140\nSo I could've install it through the GUI,\nbut sometimes you don't have that option,\n\n258\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.610\nso let's also pull this out.\n\n259\n00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.012\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, as we're pulling\nthis up, let's talk about that idea of\n\n260\n00:15:50.012 --> 00:15:52.829\nthe authorization and why that's so\nimportant in what we were doing.\n\n261\n00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:56.692\nIf you remember the process that we\nwere going through in obtaining those IP\n\n262\n00:15:56.692 --> 00:15:59.895\naddresses at the beginning\nusing that Dora process, right?\n\n263\n00:15:59.895 --> 00:16:03.712\nAnd I told you that, hey,\nthere's multiple DHTP severs out there.\n\n264\n00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:05.151\nThe initial client.\n\n265\n00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:08.980\nWell, it's gonna accept whatever\nthe first one is out there.\n\n266\n00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.840\nThe authorization helps in this way in\ncase somebody does put another DHCP\n\n267\n00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.350\nserver on your network\nthat you don't know about.\n\n268\n00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.760\nAnd this actually allows you\nto have your client say, look,\n\n269\n00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.000\nI'll only accept one from\nan authorized DHCP server as well.\n\n270\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.580\nSo even though it's not\na big thing that you tend to\n\n271\n00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.170\nhave to worry about cuz most of\nthe time we have to do it anyways.\n\n272\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.265\nIt is something for\nyou to think about as you set this up.\n\n273\n00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:34.045\nAuthorization is gonna be needed\nif it's on a separate server.\n\n274\n00:16:34.045 --> 00:16:36.899\nBut if you're running it on your DC,\nas Cherokee said,\n\n275\n00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:38.670\nyou may not need to do that.\n\n276\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.400\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, Ronnie.\n\n277\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.610\nWe don't want to have those\nrogue DHC servers, so\n\n278\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.280\nauthentication is going to\nbe used during that process.\n\n279\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.430\nAs a matter of fact, you have to be part\nof that enterprise admins group in order\n\n280\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.550\nto authorize that DHCP.\n\n281\n00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.210\nUnless delegation is otherwise specified,\nso\n\n282\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.790\nthat it is important to note,\nthank you for that.\n\n283\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.936\nNow if we can take a look\nat this console here,\n\n284\n00:16:57.936 --> 00:17:00.264\nthis is going to be our\nDHCP management console.\n\n285\n00:17:00.264 --> 00:17:02.580\nAnd I have to zoom in,\nthis is really small.\n\n286\n00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.950\nSo over here on the left-hand side,\nI can see my server.\n\n287\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:12.005\nNow from this one interface,\nI can manage IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n\n288\n00:17:12.005 --> 00:17:14.140\nFor now we're just gonna\nbe talking about IPv4 and\n\n289\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.560\nI'll walk you through how to go ahead and\ncreate a scope.\n\n290\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.138\nSo once you've subnetted and\nyou've obtained your network ranges,\n\n291\n00:17:22.138 --> 00:17:25.970\nthis is where you will manually input\nthem to create those scopes for DHCP.\n\n292\n00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.978\nI'm just gonna right-click on top\nof IPv4 and select New Scope.\n\n293\n00:17:30.978 --> 00:17:33.473\nThis will launch the new scope wizard for\nus,\n\n294\n00:17:33.473 --> 00:17:36.241\nit's a relatively easy\nprocess to walk through.\n\n295\n00:17:36.241 --> 00:17:40.997\nWe'll just hit Next and\nwe'll name this scope Scope1.\n\n296\n00:17:40.997 --> 00:17:45.225\nAnd in production you probably wanna\nprovide a description on as far as\n\n297\n00:17:45.225 --> 00:17:48.306\nmay be what users were gonna\nbe utilizing Scope1 to\n\n298\n00:17:48.306 --> 00:17:51.044\nhelp organize your\nnetwork a little better.\n\n299\n00:17:51.044 --> 00:17:53.150\nBut for now we'll just hit Next.\n\n300\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.690\nNow for Scope1, let's see here-\n&gt;&gt; Before you,\n\n301\n00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.221\nmove that over to the left a little bit\nand that way they can see the whole thing.\n\n302\n00:18:00.221 --> 00:18:01.114\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be nice.\n\n303\n00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:01.801\n&gt;&gt; There you go, that'll work.\n\n304\n00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:02.441\nAll right, there you go.\n\n305\n00:18:02.441 --> 00:18:03.384\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n306\n00:18:03.384 --> 00:18:08.238\nThe IP addresses that I have here,\nI'm just checking here in my notes.\n\n307\n00:18:08.238 --> 00:18:14.580\nI want to make sure,\nI came up with a little fake ranges here.\n\n308\n00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.028\nI think that's going to be 192.168, and\n\n309\n00:18:19.028 --> 00:18:25.764\nthis is going to be .1.2 where\n.1.1 was reserved for that router.\n\n310\n00:18:25.764 --> 00:18:30.684\nWe need to specify the end\nIP address here, so for\n\n311\n00:18:30.684 --> 00:18:37.682\nthat end IP address it's\ngoing to be 192.168.1.254.\n\n312\n00:18:37.682 --> 00:18:40.192\nWe're gonna keep it here with\nthe class C subnet mask,\n\n313\n00:18:40.192 --> 00:18:42.876\nall that information is correct,\nso now we'll hit Next.\n\n314\n00:18:45.265 --> 00:18:50.650\nWe're gonna come back to this but\njust note that to remember\n\n315\n00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:55.290\nI did mention that DHCP can\nalso set other options.\n\n316\n00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:55.820\nSo here,\n\n317\n00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:01.020\nin addition to setting reservations,\nwe have the ability to set exclusions.\n\n318\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.950\nSo exclusions are simply excluding\n\n319\n00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.810\nthe IP address from the range\nthat we've just entered.\n\n320\n00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:11.520\nHow does that differ\nfrom our reservations?\n\n321\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.940\nWell, the DHCP server will retain that\ninformation about that IP address for\n\n322\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.110\nthe reservations.\n\n323\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.950\nHowever, with exclusions,\nit doesn't obtain any information.\n\n324\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.780\nIt merely excludes that IP.\n\n325\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.160\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, this is a good\npoint to make for the exam as well.\n\n326\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.560\nSo at the very beginning, as Cherokee\nsaid, at that very first list and\n\n327\n00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.610\nthe ranges there where she skipped 1.1,\nit's cuz she knew that was gonna be her\n\n328\n00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:38.020\nrouter that's gonna be handed\nout in an option at some point.\n\n329\n00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.860\nWe don't wanna include that into\nthe address, so she went ahead and\n\n330\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.180\nexcluded it that way by just\nnot including it in the range.\n\n331\n00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.823\nBut in older Microsoft documentation,\nand a lot of times when you read this,\n\n332\n00:19:47.823 --> 00:19:49.968\nsays, no, just include the whole thing.\n\n333\n00:19:49.968 --> 00:19:53.048\nAnd then, instead, if you're gonna\ndo something like the router,\n\n334\n00:19:53.048 --> 00:19:54.440\nput the exclusion right here.\n\n335\n00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.378\nSo in here, she might actually have set\nthe 192.168.1.1 all the way through 1.1\n\n336\n00:19:59.378 --> 00:20:03.096\nas well, or 1.10, or 1.50,\nwhatever she wanted to exclude.\n\n337\n00:20:03.096 --> 00:20:03.975\nAnd that way,\n\n338\n00:20:03.975 --> 00:20:09.220\neven though it included the whole range\nfrom 1.1 all the way through 1.254.\n\n339\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.770\nShe would set this exclusion up so\nthat DHCP would say,\n\n340\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.810\nhey, we're gonna just kind of delay that.\n\n341\n00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.120\nAnd that way those addresses\nwill not be handed out.\n\n342\n00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.860\nSo you have two different versions.\n\n343\n00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.616\nMost of the time in production, I've\nalways done it the way that Cherokee just\n\n344\n00:20:20.616 --> 00:20:22.812\nshowed you, which is let's just\nnot include it in the scope.\n\n345\n00:20:22.812 --> 00:20:25.320\nAnd then we'll manually worry about it.\n\n346\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.850\nAnd here they're saying, no.\n\n347\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.360\nMicrosoft, like I said,\nin older documentation usually says,\n\n348\n00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.679\ninclude the whole thing and\njust make an exclusion for it.\n\n349\n00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.360\nSix one way,\n\n350\n00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.370\nhalf a dozen the other, in terms of\nthe way that it ends up working out.\n\n351\n00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't really matter.\n\n352\n00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.780\nBut if you see something like\nthis on the exam, go with that.\n\n353\n00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.990\nTake the whole range and\nthen make the exclusions for\n\n354\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.820\nsome of the options that you want to do.\n\n355\n00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.570\nBut I would have done it\n\n356\n00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.862\nthe exact same way in production\nthat Cherokee just showed you.\n\n357\n00:20:48.862 --> 00:20:49.382\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\n\n358\n00:20:49.382 --> 00:20:52.661\nyou also reminded me of something else to\nnote that I didn't really mention here.\n\n359\n00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:57.469\nBut let's just say,\nremember that the reason I even went\n\n360\n00:20:57.469 --> 00:21:01.386\nup to 254 here, we can't use that 255.\n\n361\n00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:05.376\nYou also want to think about, when you're\ncoming up with your networking ranges,\n\n362\n00:21:05.376 --> 00:21:08.750\nyour scopes, whenever you're doing\nthe math and subnetting it out.\n\n363\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.805\nThat first IP address is going\nto be your network ID, and\n\n364\n00:21:11.805 --> 00:21:15.648\nthe last address for that particular\nscope is gonna be a broadcast ID.\n\n365\n00:21:15.648 --> 00:21:17.488\nSo the numbers that you're inputting,\n\n366\n00:21:17.488 --> 00:21:21.179\nthe addresses that you're inputting\nright here, are the usable IP addresses.\n\n367\n00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:25.226\nSo you'll just want to remove and\nomit the first and last here, so\n\n368\n00:21:25.226 --> 00:21:27.520\nyou have to account for that as well.\n\n369\n00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.810\nAll right, so moving right along,\nthis is that option here.\n\n370\n00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.880\nLet me zoom in a little bit more and\nmaybe click off of it.\n\n371\n00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.760\nThat is the number 8 here.\n\n372\n00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.210\nYou can see it,\nthat is my default least duration time and\n\n373\n00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.172\nI could modify that like we were\ntalking about if we need to.\n\n374\n00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.290\nLong way to zoom, we'll hit Next.\n\n375\n00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.390\n&gt;&gt; Now remember, Cherokee,\nthis is a good point to emphasize again.\n\n376\n00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.350\nThe idea there is not that\nit always has to be 8 days,\n\n377\n00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.000\nit depends on the scenario\nthat Cherokee gave you.\n\n378\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.530\nAnd these are things you\nwant to think about for\n\n379\n00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:06.860\ncovering it on the exam as well when you\ndo configure the entirety of a scope here.\n\n380\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.495\nIf you're doing it where\nsomething like a coffee shop.\n\n381\n00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:13.830\n8 days is a long time to hand out\nsomebody's IP address who's only in there\n\n382\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.460\nfor 10 minutes.\n\n383\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.182\nI don't know, Cherokee goes\nto the coffee shops, I don't.\n\n384\n00:22:17.182 --> 00:22:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Thirty to an hour maybe.\n\n385\n00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.610\n&gt;&gt; If you hand out an 8 day\nlease to Cherokee and she's\n\n386\n00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:28.273\nreally only in there to get her pumpkin\nspice whatever that's actually out there.\n\n387\n00:22:28.273 --> 00:22:33.017\nThen that means that IP address is\ngone from that pool for 8 days,\n\n388\n00:22:33.017 --> 00:22:38.200\nwhile 1,000 other customers may\nactually be going in there.\n\n389\n00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.640\nCherokee actually has that\nsingle IP address for 8 days.\n\n390\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.030\nThat's pretty harsh, so\nyou may wanna reduce that down and\n\n391\n00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.740\nthat's why they give you hours and\nminutes even.\n\n392\n00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.690\nSo it just depends on how\nbusy your network is and\n\n393\n00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.550\nthat's kind of the rule of thumb, right?\n\n394\n00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.930\nIf you have devices coming in and\n\n395\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:58.200\nout of your network all the time,\nshorten that lease duration so\n\n396\n00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.890\nthat people that are actually leaving your\nnetwork you're gonna retrieve those again.\n\n397\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.650\nBut if you know that your\nnetwork's insanely stable,\n\n398\n00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.660\nthat you don't have let's say one or\ntwo devices coming in and\n\n399\n00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.370\nout of your network, then 8 day\nduration is probably pretty good, okay?\n\n400\n00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.530\nSo just kinda remember those types\nof facts as you begin to prepare and\n\n401\n00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.580\nconfigure our scope like this.\n\n402\n00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.299\n&gt;&gt; And on this particular screen,\n\n403\n00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:25.110\nthese are those options that I mentioned\nright at the beginning of this show here.\n\n404\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.200\nYou can set them up now or\nconfigure them later.\n\n405\n00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.580\nLet's just hit yes so\nthat we can see what they look like here.\n\n406\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.950\nSo for this particular one,\nremember how Ronnie had said,\n\n407\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:39.080\nI'd excluded that IP address so\nhere I can go ahead put that in.\n\n408\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.784\n192.168 and that was .1.1 for my,\n\n409\n00:23:41.784 --> 00:23:46.650\ngotta remember to hit the Add button here,\nthat's something I'm notorious for.\n\n410\n00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.572\nThat's gonna go ahead and\nset that option here.\n\n411\n00:23:51.572 --> 00:23:58.140\nWe'll hit Next and this is another\noption that I have for my DNS servers.\n\n412\n00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.798\nSo in this lab environment, I'm just gonna\nbe using myself here as my DNS server.\n\n413\n00:24:02.798 --> 00:24:07.373\nRemember in production environments\nyou want at least two different DNS\n\n414\n00:24:07.373 --> 00:24:10.750\nservers for redundancy,\nbut we'll just tick Next.\n\n415\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:16.675\nWINS servers, you maybe using\nWINS servers, probably not.\n\n416\n00:24:16.675 --> 00:24:18.645\n&gt;&gt; I can't even tell you last\ntime I saw a WINS server.\n\n417\n00:24:18.645 --> 00:24:22.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've never worked with\nWINS servers, so if you are utilizing\n\n418\n00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.656\nthe Windows Internet Naming System,\nthen someone in your environment should\n\n419\n00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:32.360\ngive you the heads up and say, hey,\nthis is something that we will be using.\n\n420\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.150\nYeah, all right, and then it says,\ndo you wanna activate this scope now?\n\n421\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.970\nMaybe there's a reason I just wanna set\nit up and have it sitting there dormant.\n\n422\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.620\nBut yeah, we'll go ahead and\nactivate it and hit Finish.\n\n423\n00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.700\nI know we're running a little\nbit short on time here.\n\n424\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.434\nI do wanna show you guys a couple\nof different scope options.\n\n425\n00:24:51.434 --> 00:24:54.750\nLet me go back to this diagram here,\nI think I have those listed.\n\n426\n00:24:55.864 --> 00:25:00.022\nYou know what, that is going to be in\nmy Word document, so let's zoom in and\n\n427\n00:25:00.022 --> 00:25:01.150\ntake a look at that.\n\n428\n00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:05.808\nNow remember, for our Option codes here.\n\n429\n00:25:05.808 --> 00:25:10.354\nThese are gonna be some pretty\ncommon ones, especially 003,\n\n430\n00:25:10.354 --> 00:25:13.342\nyou saw us configure that for that router.\n\n431\n00:25:13.342 --> 00:25:16.509\nAnd the reason I think they just use\nthe zeros for placeholders here so\n\n432\n00:25:16.509 --> 00:25:19.729\nif on this diagram it says 3 and\nyou might come across that online, but\n\n433\n00:25:19.729 --> 00:25:21.740\nthat's the only difference.\n\n434\n00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.540\nAnd here are some others as well,\nscroll down so you can take a peak.\n\n435\n00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.926\nI wouldn't necessarily know every\nsingle one that's out there,\n\n436\n00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:33.206\nlike I said there's 50 of them.\n\n437\n00:25:33.206 --> 00:25:35.550\nBut maybe just some of\nthe more common ones.\n\n438\n00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.501\nAnd you can even go\nthrough the interface and\n\n439\n00:25:38.501 --> 00:25:43.128\nthe GUI right there from your DHCP\nconsole and look at those different\n\n440\n00:25:43.128 --> 00:25:47.788\nscope options to see which ones would\nbe utilized more often for you.\n\n441\n00:25:47.788 --> 00:25:51.360\n&gt;&gt; And more than likely in today's\nenvironments, if your network is gonna be\n\n442\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.329\nsetup with like the IP phones like I was\ntalking about, you'll probably see some of\n\n443\n00:25:55.329 --> 00:25:58.903\nother ones that are actually out there\nthat you'll need to configure like I\n\n444\n00:25:58.903 --> 00:26:02.825\nmentioned for the FTP server something\nlike that for your IP phones.\n\n445\n00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:05.390\nTo be able to get those configurations\nwhen you do put them on network.\n\n446\n00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.952\nI can't remember what the port numbers or\nthose numbers are for them anyways, but\n\n447\n00:26:08.952 --> 00:26:10.253\nthis is where you would do it.\n\n448\n00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:13.636\nYou'd set those options up so as soon as\nyou plug that phone in, it not only gets\n\n449\n00:26:13.636 --> 00:26:17.125\nthe IP address, but it gets that option\nand knows exactly where that server is and\n\n450\n00:26:17.125 --> 00:26:20.080\nthen it can download and\ndo everything that it needs to.\n\n451\n00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.360\nSo you'll more than likely see that the\nDNS server is pretty much pretty popular\n\n452\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.670\nto handout,\nas well as of course the router.\n\n453\n00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.819\nSo those are all big configurations\nthat really I'm grateful for, and\n\n454\n00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:34.557\nthe subnet mask and all that.\n\n455\n00:26:34.557 --> 00:26:35.753\nI'm not the type that into\nevery single machine.\n\n456\n00:26:35.753 --> 00:26:37.227\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n457\n00:26:37.227 --> 00:26:41.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, setting it up here means I just\nset it and I just let it do its job,\n\n458\n00:26:41.546 --> 00:26:43.770\nand that's what I want to do.\n\n459\n00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.496\nSo it really does take a lot of the load\noff of an actual server administrator\n\n460\n00:26:48.496 --> 00:26:53.432\nto continue to actually be able to use\nsomething like this, very great tool.\n\n461\n00:26:53.432 --> 00:26:57.429\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, if we take a look here I just\nwanna verify that we do have that scope\n\n462\n00:26:57.429 --> 00:26:59.820\nhere within the graphical user interface.\n\n463\n00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:05.970\nSo we do have that scope that we created,\nScope1, but, you guessed it.\n\n464\n00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.228\nWe've got PowerShell coming up because\n[LAUGH] we're gonna be using PowerShell\n\n465\n00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:14.229\nto help even just simplify this process so\nI don't have to even potentially\n\n466\n00:27:14.229 --> 00:27:17.866\ncreate scopes individually,\nI could do it all at once or whatever.\n\n467\n00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:21.114\nBut the exam objectives,\nthey want you know how to create scopes,\n\n468\n00:27:21.114 --> 00:27:23.850\nlet's look at different\nways that we can do that.\n\n469\n00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.253\nAnd different ways that we can use our\ntools like PowerShell to obtain statistics\n\n470\n00:27:28.253 --> 00:27:29.948\nand even create superscopes.\n\n471\n00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:33.570\nBut I think we're out of time so that's\ngonna have to be in the next show, Ronnie.\n\n472\n00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.928\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\nthank you again for\n\n473\n00:27:35.928 --> 00:27:39.935\nhelping us out here to understand more\nabout DHCP and how we get started.\n\n474\n00:27:39.935 --> 00:27:44.025\nBut there is a lot more options to come or\na lot more different ways that we\n\n475\n00:27:44.025 --> 00:27:48.920\ncan configure DHCP and Cherokee's gonna\nshow us all that in another episode.\n\n476\n00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.189\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n477\n00:27:53.189 --> 00:27:54.277\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n478\n00:27:54.277 --> 00:27:59.722\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n479\n00:27:59.722 --> 00:28:05.834\n[MUSIC]\n\n480\n00:28:05.834 --> 00:28:08.720\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.244\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:11.529\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.880\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n7\n00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.024\nWe're specifically focusing\nin on exam 70-410,\n\n8\n00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:26.350\nand we're taking a look at deploying and\nof course configuring DHCP servers.\n\n9\n00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.310\nWe are in a part two, and here to help\nus as we continue on is gonna be Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.500\nCherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.710\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.570\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me Ronnie,\nhow is it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.520\n&gt;&gt; It is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.223\nNow Cherokee, we've gone ahead and we've\ntaken a look at the basic configuration of\n\n15\n00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:44.270\ncourse of setting up the DHCP server,\nwe've even created a scope.\n\n16\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.500\nSo what are we taking a look at here,\nin this part two?\n\n17\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.842\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, we are gonna be\ntaking a look at some PowerShell,\n\n18\n00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:52.960\nhow to generate scopes that way,\nand we''ll also look at\n\n19\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.700\nsome configuration options both in\nthe GUI and PowerShell as well.\n\n20\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.930\nSo let's go ahead and get started because\nthere is a lot of typing here and\n\n21\n00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.470\nhopefully I will do my best to not\nhave any typos but, let's take a look.\n\n22\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.400\nWhat we can do, remember we created scope\n1 within the GUI so let's go ahead and\n\n23\n00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.959\ncreate scope 2 and\nI'll show you how that looks.\n\n24\n00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.080\nAll right, our commandlet is going to be,\nadd -dhcp server.\n\n25\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040\nThis is going to be noted as v4,\nfor version four.\n\n26\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.160\nAnd we'll specify, scope -name.\n\n27\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.176\nThe name of our scope,\nwe'll just keep it the same here, and\n\n28\n00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:36.605\nwe'll label that scope2.\n\n29\n00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:39.370\nAnd end quote.\n\n30\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.050\nWe need to specify our ranges here.\n\n31\n00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.300\nSo for our start range this is\n\n32\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.803\ngoing to be 192.168.2.1.\n\n33\n00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:56.856\nAnd for our end range we'll go\nall the way up to end there at,\n\n34\n00:01:56.856 --> 00:02:02.517\noops let me not do an underscore,\nI wonder why I wanna do one there,\n\n35\n00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:07.285\nall right\n&gt;&gt; It's that E that you have to shift.\n\n36\n00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:08.649\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n37\n00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.102\nthere are certain words I've noticed,\nlike I do the same typos all the time.\n\n38\n00:02:12.102 --> 00:02:17.050\nAll right, .254\n&gt;&gt; We also need to include the subnet\n\n39\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.750\nmask here as well, so we'll go ahead and\ngive that a class C subnet mask.\n\n40\n00:02:29.662 --> 00:02:33.580\nAll right,\nnow when we create that particular range,\n\n41\n00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.550\nadditional options like we were talking\nabout whenever we were creating\n\n42\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.510\nour scope within the graphical\nuser interface, we could specify\n\n43\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.090\ndifferent options available to us,\nthat's just kind of basic as is.\n\n44\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.330\nSo if we wanted to set that router\nconfiguration or anything like that,\n\n45\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.999\nwe would need to do that as well\n&gt;&gt; You could add additional perimeters,\n\n46\n00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:58.417\nand have one long string of syntax, but\nfor this one let's just go ahead and\n\n47\n00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:01.450\nwe'll specify the router\nhere with a set command.\n\n48\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.766\nSo set dash commandlet\ndhcp server version four,\n\n49\n00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:10.951\nand we're gonna use the option value.\n\n50\n00:03:15.102 --> 00:03:16.380\n&gt;&gt; That's quite a long commandlet, there.\n\n51\n00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] all right, and\nthen we need to specify the scope ID.\n\n52\n00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.831\nSo just remember, the scope ID\nis going to be your network ID,\n\n53\n00:03:27.831 --> 00:03:34.533\nwith that last, the fourth octet being\na zero here, so our scope ID is, oops,\n\n54\n00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:40.140\n192.168, this is going to be .2.0 here for\nthat one,\n\n55\n00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:48.123\nI did it again with the double quotes\nall right, and then here for our router,\n\n56\n00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:55.650\nremember our router was 192.168.1.1 and\nwe'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n57\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.090\n&gt;&gt; You take away that period\nafter the one at the end.\n\n58\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.760\n&gt;&gt; I see it there.\n\n59\n00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.422\n&gt;&gt; And also, you may want to set\nthat to 2.0 to be on the same\n\n60\n00:04:01.422 --> 00:04:02.224\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n61\n00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:04.650\nBecause otherwise it's on\na different network carrier.\n\n62\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.441\nJust try to plug some numbers in here for\nthe demo, but\n\n63\n00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.847\nof course they do have to work,\nthat would help out, as well.\n\n64\n00:04:10.847 --> 00:04:12.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n65\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.140\nnow we've created Scope Two.\n\n66\n00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.030\nAnd there is,\njust let me clear some of this off.\n\n67\n00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.600\nThere is another way that we can\ncreate scopes here within PowerShell.\n\n68\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.400\nYou can use the Net SH command.\n\n69\n00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.850\nSo let's take a look at\nthat method as well.\n\n70\n00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.220\nWe'll create a third scope,\nso we type in net sh and\n\n71\n00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.650\nthen DHCP server.\n\n72\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.886\nAnd then add scope.\n\n73\n00:04:37.886 --> 00:04:47.070\nThe range here 192.168.3.0 for this range.\n\n74\n00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.407\nAnd we'll specify again class C.\n\n75\n00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:53.494\nAnd then the name,\n\n76\n00:04:53.494 --> 00:04:57.760\nwe'll name this one scope3 because\nI'm feeling really creative today.\n\n77\n00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.340\nWe'll hit enter, you can see that\nthe command completed successfully.\n\n78\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.880\nBut then again we also need to\nat least set our router here.\n\n79\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.500\nLet's see, or actually more importantly,\nI should say, let's specify the range.\n\n80\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.710\nSo we just created the scope,\nbut we also need to define\n\n81\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.950\nwhat addresses are going to be used,\nwithin that scope, so let's do that next.\n\n82\n00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.821\nSo again, this is gonna be net sh dhcp,\nand then server scope.\n\n83\n00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:32.220\nAnd we'll say 192.168.\n\n84\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.281\nAnd since this is scope 3 we'll say .3.0.\n\n85\n00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:44.942\nAdd iprange 192.168.\n\n86\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.840\nThis is going to be .3.\n\n87\n00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.827\n&gt;&gt; .3?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n88\n00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:54.500\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n89\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.410\n&gt;&gt; A range of numbers?\n\n90\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes, starting here at the 1 because\nthat's our network ID for that first one.\n\n91\n00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.920\nFirst usable IP address being 1 going,\nand then space, we'll put 192.168.\n\n92\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.190\nThis is going to be a shorter range here.\n\n93\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.496\nI'm just going to go up to 20,\nand that should be good to go.\n\n94\n00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:16.864\nDot, change the scope context 1923,\n\n95\n00:06:16.864 --> 00:06:21.720\nhold on, let me check that out real quick.\n\n96\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.995\n&gt;&gt; It says it's successfully completed.\n\n97\n00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:24.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n98\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.580\nChange the current.\n\n99\n00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.260\nAll right, just want to make sure.\n\n100\n00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.950\nSo net SH, that is another way\nthat you could do that there.\n\n101\n00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.310\nI just wanted to at least show\nyou that there were some options.\n\n102\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.200\nSo we've looked at it\nthree different ways.\n\n103\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.770\nNow, if you want to check and\nmake sure that they are in fact there.\n\n104\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.280\nOf course you can check in the GUI, but\n\n105\n00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.289\nanother thing that you can do here,\nlet me just clear this off.\n\n106\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.468\nWe can type in, get-DHCP, and\n\n107\n00:06:46.468 --> 00:06:52.253\nthat's going to be server version four,\nand then scope.\n\n108\n00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:59.394\nAnd then we'll pipe that into\na format list here, hit enter.\n\n109\n00:06:59.394 --> 00:07:02.798\nOops, I have a typo that's what happened,\n\n110\n00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:06.858\nI got a couple of characters\nhere that do not belong.\n\n111\n00:07:06.858 --> 00:07:11.577\nServer scope DHCP server version\n\n112\n00:07:11.577 --> 00:07:16.800\nfour scope get DHCP server, SER,\n\n113\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.529\nOkay so I've got quite a few typos here,\n\n114\n00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:26.756\nlet me just retype that here.\n\n115\n00:07:26.756 --> 00:07:28.802\nI'm like, what's going on.\n\n116\n00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:33.392\nDHCP, server, version four,\n\n117\n00:07:33.392 --> 00:07:38.500\nscope, and then pipe that into FL.\n\n118\n00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.870\nI mean, that doesn't have to\nbe capitalized but we will.\n\n119\n00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.980\nAnd then this will show us our different\nscopes that we have available.\n\n120\n00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.260\nSo let's just check that out and\nsee what we've got going on.\n\n121\n00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.310\nAll right.\n\n122\n00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.872\nRight here we see our scope 1\nthat we created in the GUI.\n\n123\n00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:59.587\nAll right.\nScrolling down here, we see scope 2.\n\n124\n00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:06.750\nAnd the parameters as well as scope three,\nright here.\n\n125\n00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.850\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, it's very interesting\nthat you showed us three different methods\n\n126\n00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:16.400\nhere not only in the GUI but also in\nPowerShell, but then in netsh as well.\n\n127\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.890\nAnd the reason why we\nwanted to point that out is\n\n128\n00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.060\nwe don't know which one on the exam\nthey're pretty much gonna call you out on.\n\n129\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.760\nSo you might have these three\ndifferent options before you.\n\n130\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.736\nIf it were me in terms of preference I\nwould probably end up choosing PowerShell,\n\n131\n00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:33.652\nand that's because the world is heading\ntowards PowerShell as far as Microsoft\n\n132\n00:08:33.652 --> 00:08:34.192\nis going.\n\n133\n00:08:34.192 --> 00:08:40.100\nAnd that would be the way\nthat I would configure it.\n\n134\n00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.200\nBut overall though, on the exam you\ndon't know which one of these, so\n\n135\n00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.440\nmake sure you understand.\n\n136\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.730\nAnd both of those right,\nwhichever one that Cherokee did,\n\n137\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.720\nshe configured the scope and\nthen she configured the ranges as well.\n\n138\n00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.295\nAnd in the first one you used\noptions whereas in the SH-\n\n139\n00:08:56.295 --> 00:08:58.265\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah, and there's a lot there for\n\n140\n00:08:58.265 --> 00:09:00.246\nthe syntax for those different options.\n\n141\n00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:02.251\nJust remember, like I said,\nthere are a lot of them out there.\n\n142\n00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:06.420\nSo that was just a basic example you\nwould have to set it to whatever your\n\n143\n00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.082\norganization was requiring for\nthat particular scope.\n\n144\n00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:14.342\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that kinda brings up a good\nissue, once again, for facing the exam.\n\n145\n00:09:14.342 --> 00:09:16.622\nIt could be that you setup\nthe scope like Cherokee did,\n\n146\n00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:21.392\nwith the idea of creating\nit in PowerShell.\n\n147\n00:09:21.392 --> 00:09:27.080\nBut now you can't, your clients cannot\nget access outside of your network.\n\n148\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.640\nWell what might you be missing?\n\n149\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.730\nYou might be missing that option command.\n\n150\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.274\nRemember I said that that\nwas a long option that set\n\n151\n00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:38.416\ndash DHCP server options values.\n\n152\n00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:40.630\nThat might be something you're missing.\n\n153\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.290\nOr in the netsh, if you don't have the\nscope configured as far as the range goes,\n\n154\n00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.150\nbut you do have the initial statement.\n\n155\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.850\nYou gotta know which options\nyou may be missing out here.\n\n156\n00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.030\nSo pay attention, make sure you understand\nthat both of those in the command line\n\n157\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.100\nmight require a little bit more typing\nthan what we're normally used to.\n\n158\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.670\nCuz it seems like it is a couple\nsteps in either way that we do it.\n\n159\n00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:05.280\nThat's right Ronnie, and\nthere's a lot that goes into DHCP, so\n\n160\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.240\nI'm not gonna say hey you're gonna get\nevery single one of these questions.\n\n161\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.930\nIt's gonna be different for\n\n162\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.710\ndepending on whatever pool of\nquestions that you do get.\n\n163\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.870\nSo, just knowing a variety is probably\na good idea for this particular topic\n\n164\n00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:24.230\nbecause it is pretty, they have an entire\nsection just on DHCP so, all right.\n\n165\n00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:28.450\nNow what happens when we create our scopes\nand we need to keep an eye on them and\n\n166\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.270\nmanage them.\n\n167\n00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.210\nSo let's think about that, because\nremember, the concepts of having these\n\n168\n00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.985\nscopes is to be doling them out to\nusers within their environment.\n\n169\n00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:44.535\nWe wanna have good management procedures\non that, as far as making sure we're\n\n170\n00:10:44.535 --> 00:10:49.155\nnot over allocating or getting to the end\nof that available pool of addresses.\n\n171\n00:10:49.155 --> 00:10:55.190\nSo we can view statistics,\nlet's pull up the console real quick.\n\n172\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.650\nAnd let me just hit refresh here,\nso we can see our other scopes.\n\n173\n00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:07.264\nI can use the graphical user interface to,\nlet me try that again.\n\n174\n00:11:15.315 --> 00:11:19.852\n[LAUGH] Okay, let me just show\nyou where it is on this one.\n\n175\n00:11:19.852 --> 00:11:22.480\nAnd let me move my little magnifier here.\n\n176\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.990\nMy scopes aren't refreshing yet,\nbut give me one second here.\n\n177\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.900\nI do wanna show you where you\ncan look at the statistics.\n\n178\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.590\nSo let's say statistics for\nthis first scope here.\n\n179\n00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.190\nYou can just right-click,\n\n180\n00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.730\nactually, right this first option here,\nDisplay Statistics.\n\n181\n00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.770\nSo that's a quick easy way to look at\nhow many IP addresses are being used\n\n182\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.860\nfrom that particular scope,\nand how many are available.\n\n183\n00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.290\nAnd then of course how many\ntotal are available here.\n\n184\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.630\nBut we can also do that within PowerShell.\n\n185\n00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.480\nSo let me pull PowerShell back up and\n\n186\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.310\njust show you a couple things\nthat you can do there.\n\n187\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.880\nSo let me just go ahead and\nclear this out.\n\n188\n00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:05.710\nAll right, so in order to get the\nstatistics, again, you can just type in\n\n189\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:11.630\nthe get-dhcp,\nthis is going to be our server version 4.\n\n190\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.760\nSo for v4 scope statistics.\n\n191\n00:12:20.338 --> 00:12:24.660\nAll right, so here you can see those\nthree scopes that we had created.\n\n192\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.960\nThese are the statistics for each one, and\n\n193\n00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.120\nthis is just a high level\noverview of scope statistics.\n\n194\n00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.240\nYou can generally select each\nindividuals scopes to pick up\n\n195\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.120\nmore information about them.\n\n196\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.840\nBut I do wanna show you another option\nas well that I think it's pretty useful.\n\n197\n00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.070\nLet's go ahead and just [INAUDIBLE] up\nerror to pull that command string back in,\n\n198\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:48.760\nand then take that output and\ntype it into a comparison operator here.\n\n199\n00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.805\nWhere we state this is going to be where,\npercentage,\n\n200\n00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:59.317\nPercentage in this one\nis going to be in use,\n\n201\n00:12:59.317 --> 00:13:02.810\nis going to be greater than 80%.\n\n202\n00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.573\nAnd let me just make sure\nthat my syntax is good.\n\n203\n00:13:04.573 --> 00:13:06.490\nAll right, looks good.\n\n204\n00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.892\nNow, -gt80.\n\n205\n00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:12.513\nI need a space.\n\n206\n00:13:12.513 --> 00:13:16.016\nAll right, there was a typo there,\nall right.\n\n207\n00:13:16.016 --> 00:13:19.439\nThe issue with this particular\nconfiguration here,\n\n208\n00:13:19.439 --> 00:13:21.873\nsince we just created those scopes and\n\n209\n00:13:21.873 --> 00:13:27.290\nI don't have end users pulling those down\ninto their systems, those IP addresses.\n\n210\n00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.600\nNo one's actually using the IP\naddresses that we just put out there.\n\n211\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.540\nSo nothing came up.\n\n212\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.571\nNow if I hit the up arrow\nto pull that again,\n\n213\n00:13:35.571 --> 00:13:40.552\nI can just simply change that comparison\noperator to LT for less than.\n\n214\n00:13:40.552 --> 00:13:43.898\nAnd then again if I wanted to\nstick with that BD 20 rule,\n\n215\n00:13:43.898 --> 00:13:47.037\nI can check for\nless than 80% being utilized here,\n\n216\n00:13:47.037 --> 00:13:51.526\nand I can see that while all of my\nscopes are being utilized less than 80%.\n\n217\n00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:55.360\nSo that's just something you can do, and\nagain, those are just some examples.\n\n218\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.277\nAnd of course, PowerShell is so robust\nthat you could really define exactly what\n\n219\n00:14:00.277 --> 00:14:05.051\nit is you're looking for, potentially\neven creating those scripts to really\n\n220\n00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:08.410\nautomate and\nmake that management a lot easier.\n\n221\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.421\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, Mark in our chat room\nbrings up something that we can try as far\n\n222\n00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:16.178\nas the GUI interface goes, which is\nto right click on the IP version, or\n\n223\n00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:17.384\nversion four branch.\n\n224\n00:14:17.384 --> 00:14:18.157\n&gt;&gt; Perfect let's do it.\n\n225\n00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:20.394\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if we can try that so\nlet's see if we can-\n\n226\n00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:20.922\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n227\n00:14:20.922 --> 00:14:21.775\n&gt;&gt; See it there.\n\n228\n00:14:21.775 --> 00:14:24.584\n&gt;&gt; All right, so go ahead and\nright click on, that's right,\n\n229\n00:14:24.584 --> 00:14:27.863\nthere's a refresh right here\nassociated with that IP version four.\n\n230\n00:14:27.863 --> 00:14:30.201\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n&gt;&gt; Mark, you rock, let me just tell you.\n\n231\n00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:35.021\nIf you note down here the server option,\nso if I were to go ahead and\n\n232\n00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:38.882\nconfigure those, select configure options.\n\n233\n00:14:38.882 --> 00:14:42.670\nAnd then, this is that list that we've\nalready seen in that diagram and\n\n234\n00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:46.080\ntalked about all the different numerical\ncodes that we could be using here,\n\n235\n00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.050\nbut I could apply it easily\non a per-server basis.\n\n236\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:56.950\nBut it is important to know that my,\nand I did that again here, all right.\n\n237\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.180\nIt is important to know that\nthe order of precedence there, so\n\n238\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.640\nI don't have to worry about hey,\nare these going to be conflicting?\n\n239\n00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.590\nAnd there's also a couple other\ntypes of options that we can set.\n\n240\n00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.097\nOne, that I really wanna show you,\n\n241\n00:15:12.097 --> 00:15:16.863\nmay be useful in your situation is\nsomething called class options,\n\n242\n00:15:16.863 --> 00:15:22.479\nwhich are actually going to override both\nthe server and scope options as well.\n\n243\n00:15:22.479 --> 00:15:29.219\nAnd utilizing that IPv4 section\nright there, the node there, yeah.\n\n244\n00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:33.000\nThat's where we would go ahead and\nset those class options.\n\n245\n00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.890\nSo let's take a look.\n\n246\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:39.039\nIf we were just to right click here,\nand let's see, defined user classes.\n\n247\n00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:41.370\nThat's what we wanna select for\nthis example.\n\n248\n00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.990\nNow, let's think about the scenario\nas to why I would want to do this.\n\n249\n00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.921\nFor instance, if we just created\nthose three scopes, right?\n\n250\n00:15:49.921 --> 00:15:52.419\nAnd within those three scopes,\n\n251\n00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:58.352\nmaybe I specified them all to use\na particular router as my default gateway.\n\n252\n00:15:58.352 --> 00:16:02.244\nBut maybe I have one department,\nlike the production team.\n\n253\n00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:06.911\nAnd they really download a lot of\nvideos or upload a lot of videos.\n\n254\n00:16:06.911 --> 00:16:12.660\nSo I might need to have a faster\ngateway for that particular department.\n\n255\n00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.340\nI could go ahead and\nset that in the section here.\n\n256\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.610\nThere are a couple defaults, but\n\n257\n00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.530\nI'm gonna select Add,\nwe're gonna create a new class.\n\n258\n00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.312\nSo for this Display Name, let's go ahead\nand name this one High-Speed-Gateway.\n\n259\n00:16:27.604 --> 00:16:32.549\nAll right, now you have to specify\nthe ASCII characters down here and\n\n260\n00:16:32.549 --> 00:16:35.882\nthe name that you will use for\nconfiguration.\n\n261\n00:16:35.882 --> 00:16:39.388\nIt is case-sensitive so I'm just going\nto type that in as High-Speed here.\n\n262\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.900\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n263\n00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.000\nAnd we're gonna hit OK.\n\n264\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.931\nNow, in earlier versions of the server\noperating system, you could go ahead and\n\n265\n00:16:52.931 --> 00:16:57.791\ndefine all the additional configurations\nright here from this little interface.\n\n266\n00:16:57.791 --> 00:17:00.047\nBut with 2012,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n267\n00:17:00.047 --> 00:17:01.688\nSo we're gonna hit Close.\n\n268\n00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:07.171\nAnd then we need to go ahead and set up\na policy associated with that user class,\n\n269\n00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:11.673\nlet's see here actually,\nif I'm getting in my right section.\n\n270\n00:17:11.673 --> 00:17:15.341\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nnow that you've said that we're gonna set\n\n271\n00:17:15.341 --> 00:17:19.820\nthis idea of those class options, which of\nthese nodes are we gonna end up picking?\n\n272\n00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.930\nWe're not gonna pick one inside the scope.\n\n273\n00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.367\nAnd so what are we actually gonna do here?\n\n274\n00:17:23.367 --> 00:17:27.840\n&gt;&gt; Right, we have the ability to\nset individual scope policies.\n\n275\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.720\nBut we wanna make sure that\nwe're in the IPv4 section here.\n\n276\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.950\nSo you could select from right here.\n\n277\n00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.290\nOr in the right-hand pane\nthere's also an option.\n\n278\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:42.050\nAs long as you make sure you're\nconfiguring this for the, I don't\n\n279\n00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.390\nwanna use the word scope, but\nfor exactly what you're doing.\n\n280\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.806\nIf it's at a smaller level for\nthe scope options,\n\n281\n00:17:50.806 --> 00:17:54.150\nlarger level for\nthe entire IPv4 section here.\n\n282\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.392\nSo let's just right-click and\nselect New Policy.\n\n283\n00:17:57.392 --> 00:17:59.690\nThen I'll go ahead and\nlaunch this wizard here.\n\n284\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:05.575\nSo for the name of our policy, let's go\nahead and name it High-Speed-Gateway here.\n\n285\n00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:14.285\nAll right, and in production of course,\nI would want to go ahead and\n\n286\n00:18:14.285 --> 00:18:16.229\ngive that some kind of description.\n\n287\n00:18:16.229 --> 00:18:21.394\nMaybe we could even say production\nteam users, something like that, or\n\n288\n00:18:21.394 --> 00:18:26.742\nmaybe the model of the actual router\nthat they were using for that gateway.\n\n289\n00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:31.839\nAll right, for our configuration\noptions here, we need to,\n\n290\n00:18:31.839 --> 00:18:36.837\nlet's see, we want to set this\nto go ahead and be equal to, so\n\n291\n00:18:36.837 --> 00:18:43.420\nwe wanna say that our user class is equal\nto here, so let's go ahead and hit Add.\n\n292\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.844\nDrop down from vendor class,\nlet's select User Class, and then Equals.\n\n293\n00:18:48.844 --> 00:18:53.772\nAnd then we wanna choose that policy that\nwe just created right here from this\n\n294\n00:18:53.772 --> 00:18:54.850\ndropdown menu.\n\n295\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.220\nThere it is, High-Speed-Gateway.\n\n296\n00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.393\nAnd we wanna make sure that\nwe hit the Add button so\n\n297\n00:18:59.393 --> 00:19:01.200\nit adds it into this section right here.\n\n298\n00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.650\nAnd we should be good there.\n\n299\n00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.670\nHit OK.\n\n300\n00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.555\nAnd then Next.\n\n301\n00:19:09.555 --> 00:19:13.440\nBecause we want to specify a different\nrouter, this is the command, or\n\n302\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.770\nthe option, the DHCP option,\nthat we'll be configuring.\n\n303\n00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.240\nAnd again, remember, there are a lot\nof different things that you could set\n\n304\n00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.940\nfrom within this option here,\nthis option menu.\n\n305\n00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.195\nBut we're gonna choose 003 here for\nour router.\n\n306\n00:19:27.195 --> 00:19:33.749\nAll right, so for that, we're gonna,\nlet's just say the IP address for\n\n307\n00:19:33.749 --> 00:19:37.779\nthat super fast router was 192.168.\n\n308\n00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.158\n&gt;&gt; 1.254.\n\n309\n00:19:39.158 --> 00:19:41.218\n&gt;&gt; 1.254.\n\n310\n00:19:41.218 --> 00:19:41.997\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not.\n\n311\n00:19:41.997 --> 00:19:47.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll hit Add and\ngo ahead and add that in there.\n\n312\n00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.770\nAnd hit Next and then Finish.\n\n313\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.820\nSo, I could go ahead and wait for\nthe settings to go in effect.\n\n314\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:00.520\nIf I was in a rush and I wanted I was\nworking with a client on a client\n\n315\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.870\nsystem and I wanted to push that out\nright away, there are a couple different.\n\n316\n00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.901\nYou can use ipconfig to help push\nthat policy to your clients as well,\n\n317\n00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:09.954\nclient side.\n\n318\n00:20:09.954 --> 00:20:14.237\nSo you would just specify the name of your\nadapter and change that to high speed.\n\n319\n00:20:14.237 --> 00:20:18.469\nSo you might want to check and see what\nadapter it is that that client's using.\n\n320\n00:20:18.469 --> 00:20:20.127\nOtherwise, you would\njust wait a few seconds.\n\n321\n00:20:20.127 --> 00:20:24.166\nBut that's about it as far as\nconfiguring that class option.\n\n322\n00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:29.970\nSo any one that I'm specifying there for\nthose production members,\n\n323\n00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.240\nthey would be using that faster router\nversus what I had set for everyone else,\n\n324\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.730\nthe option in my network.\n\n325\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.497\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee, you just\nwent over a ton of material in the last\n\n326\n00:20:40.497 --> 00:20:45.432\nfew minutes here in terms of the scope\noption or the, yeah, I was trying-\n\n327\n00:20:45.432 --> 00:20:46.749\n&gt;&gt; We created scopes.\n\n328\n00:20:46.749 --> 00:20:49.165\nI know, and there's still so\nmuch more to do, Ronnie.\n\n329\n00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:50.037\nSo, let's see.\n\n330\n00:20:50.037 --> 00:20:53.480\n&gt;&gt; Remember that you said that certain\nthings override certain things.\n\n331\n00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.732\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, go ahead and review that for us.\n\n332\n00:20:54.732 --> 00:20:56.090\n&gt;&gt; Review that one, okay.\n\n333\n00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.370\n&gt;&gt; And also, the idea of the class options\nthat you were just talking about and\n\n334\n00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.800\nthe server options.\n\n335\n00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.896\nMake sure we have a good\nunderstanding of that.\n\n336\n00:21:02.896 --> 00:21:07.288\nSo, tell us the order again, and\nwhat it is that we're doing.\n\n337\n00:21:07.288 --> 00:21:11.231\n&gt;&gt; Scope options take\nprecedence over server options.\n\n338\n00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:16.079\nMeaning that whatever you configure for\nan individual scope is gonna override what\n\n339\n00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:20.320\nyou may have already configured\nserver-wide for those options.\n\n340\n00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.880\nHowever, if you create a specific,\nlike we just we did,\n\n341\n00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.685\nwe defined a user class option.\n\n342\n00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:30.100\nThat user class option is gonna\noverride both this server and\n\n343\n00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.960\nthe scope options for\nthat particular setting.\n\n344\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's actually going to\nbe important for the exam, once again.\n\n345\n00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.929\nBecause there are times when\nyou will end up seeing,\n\n346\n00:21:40.929 --> 00:21:45.532\nyou'll have these two options set or\nmaybe all three of the options set here.\n\n347\n00:21:45.532 --> 00:21:49.510\nAnd say, hey, which one of\nthese is gonna end up applying?\n\n348\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.920\nYou've got to understand\nthat order of precedence and\n\n349\n00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.260\nthe way that ends up working.\n\n350\n00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.540\nEspecially with the way that\nthese options are set up.\n\n351\n00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.650\nIf not,\nyou're gonna configure the wrong thing.\n\n352\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.550\nOr you're not gonna actually have\nthe right one selected there.\n\n353\n00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.120\nCherokee showed us both where it was,\nas well as that order and\n\n354\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.920\nunderstanding of what's gonna be there.\n\n355\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.700\nAll right, so Cherokee,\nwe have just a few minutes left.\n\n356\n00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.520\nWhat else are we taking a look at here?\n\n357\n00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.616\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I think let's save it for\nthe next show,\n\n358\n00:22:13.616 --> 00:22:18.205\nbecause we still have some extra\nconfiguration options available to us.\n\n359\n00:22:18.205 --> 00:22:20.912\nAnd I think that would be a great\nplace to pick right back up.\n\n360\n00:22:20.912 --> 00:22:21.739\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\nWell,\n\n361\n00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:25.420\nthank you again by helping us to\nactually learn a little bit more.\n\n362\n00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.439\nRemember that what you took\na look at in this episode, right,\n\n363\n00:22:28.439 --> 00:22:32.348\nis that we saw the different ways that\nwe can add in, well, additional scopes.\n\n364\n00:22:32.348 --> 00:22:35.300\nNot only in the first episode\ndid we pick up on a GUI,\n\n365\n00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.700\nwhere we could walk through the menu and\ncreate a scope and do all that.\n\n366\n00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.757\nCherokee showed us in PowerShell,\nas well as in Netsh.\n\n367\n00:22:42.757 --> 00:22:46.076\nShe also talked about the different\noptions that are actually available there,\n\n368\n00:22:46.076 --> 00:22:49.017\nas well as understanding difference\nbetween the scope and the server.\n\n369\n00:22:49.017 --> 00:22:53.760\nAnd even the idea of using these class\noptions that are also available to us.\n\n370\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:56.220\nPay attention,\nespecially if you are getting ready for\n\n371\n00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.940\nthe exam, on those issues as well.\n\n372\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:02.170\nThere is a lot more to come for\nDHCP, but that will be for\n\n373\n00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.520\nanother episode that Cherokee\nwill bring us through.\n\n374\n00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.082\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n375\n00:23:09.082 --> 00:23:10.004\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n376\n00:23:10.004 --> 00:23:15.755\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the MCSA 70-410 shows.\n\n377\n00:23:15.755 --> 00:23:21.422\n[MUSIC]\n\n378\n00:23:21.422 --> 00:23:25.211\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

00:00:11.648\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:15.339\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.092\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2.\n\n6\n00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:23.210\nYou're taking a look at\nof course Exam 70-410.\n\n7\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.710\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.890\nAnd today we're diving into a part three\non deploying and configuring DHCP servers.\n\n9\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.745\nAnd here of course to continue\nwith that particular series is\n\n10\n00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:35.035\nIs gonna be Ms Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.405\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:39.005\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for allowing me\nback to the show, Ronnie [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.005\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes,\n\n14\n00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.490\nyou are allowed back to the show because\nyou must continue and complete us.\n\n15\n00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.934\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I know,\nwe're right in the middle of DHCP now, so-\n\n16\n00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:48.732\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:50.852\nSo Cherokee, what else do we\nhave to take a look at now?\n\n18\n00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:54.212\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, you know when we set up\nthose scopes we really didn't specify\n\n19\n00:00:54.212 --> 00:00:57.352\nany kind of exclusions or reservations.\n\n20\n00:00:57.352 --> 00:00:59.780\nWe talked about that,\nwe saw where we could do that.\n\n21\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.640\nBut when it comes to reservations,\nI had mentioned that exclusions.\n\n22\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.680\nThe server doesn't maintain any\ninformation about that particular\n\n23\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.930\nexclusion aside from, hey,\ndon't use this IP address.\n\n24\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.230\nBut with reservations there\nis a little bit more to it.\n\n25\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.300\nSo I wanted to show you a couple different\nways in which you could schedule or\n\n26\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.680\nset those reservations.\n\n27\n00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.710\nSo I guess the easiest way would be,\nor I say easiest.\n\n28\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.880\nBut the most familiar, if you're not\nfamiliar with a command line interface,\n\n29\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.780\nwould be using the graphical\nuser interface.\n\n30\n00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.480\nWhich we could set\n\n31\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.590\nthose reservations right here\nfrom our DHCP Management Console.\n\n32\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.320\nSo if I wanted to do that,\nlet's take a look here.\n\n33\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.560\nAnd here are those three scopes that we've\ncreated already, I could zoom in and\n\n34\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.940\ntake a look at scope number 1 here.\n\n35\n00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.300\nAnd I have a section for reservations.\n\n36\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.840\nIt's pretty straightforward, Ronnie.\n\n37\n00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.130\nI would just go ahead and make sure that,\n\n38\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.835\nI'm going to right-click here and\nselect New Reservation.\n\n39\n00:01:56.835 --> 00:01:59.275\nThere's a little wizard that pops up and\n\n40\n00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:01.940\nthis is where I would\ninput that IP address.\n\n41\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.910\nSo maybe I had a reservation for\nthe sales printer.\n\n42\n00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.830\nI always use sales.\n\n43\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.773\nI don't know, it seems like everyone's\ngot a sales department, right?\n\n44\n00:02:11.773 --> 00:02:15.422\nAll right, so here we've got a sales\nprinter and I could put the IP address for\n\n45\n00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:17.490\nwithin this particular scope here.\n\n46\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.744\nSo maybe 15 and then I would also\nneed to specify a MAC address.\n\n47\n00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:27.360\nBecause I don't have an actual device\nright here with a MAC address.\n\n48\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.875\nSo let's see, if I just go ahead and\nput in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and\n\n49\n00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:36.080\nthat's not gonna be a correct MAC address.\n\n50\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.796\nBut I can put it in,\nis very simple to just set this.\n\n51\n00:02:38.796 --> 00:02:41.540\nIt's gonna balk at me for\nnot having a valid MAC address right here.\n\n52\n00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.820\nYeah, so our unique identifier you\nhave entered may not be correct, but\n\n53\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.900\ndo you wanna use this identifier anyway?\n\n54\n00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.970\nSo in real life, of course,\n\n55\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.555\nI'd wanna make sure that that was that\nprinter's MAC address but for now.\n\n56\n00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:57.263\nAnd really, that's it and you just hit.\n\n57\n00:02:57.263 --> 00:03:00.538\nOops, excuse me, I hit,\nit already set that for us.\n\n58\n00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:03.277\nHit Close, and now you can see that that\n\n59\n00:03:03.277 --> 00:03:08.260\none particular reservation has been\nset for that sales printer there.\n\n60\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.870\nBut of course, there are other\nways to go ahead and do this.\n\n61\n00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.672\nMicrosoft does give us some options here,\nso\n\n62\n00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:19.370\nlet's take a look at what that\nwould be within PowerShell.\n\n63\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.073\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, Cherokee,\nas we're going to PowerShell to do this,\n\n64\n00:03:23.073 --> 00:03:26.797\nlet's talk about this idea of\nthe reservation again and make sure why.\n\n65\n00:03:26.797 --> 00:03:30.203\nWe may have people out there that\nare just trying to figure out, okay,\n\n66\n00:03:30.203 --> 00:03:32.821\nwhy do I want to create this\nparticular reservation?\n\n67\n00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:37.119\nAnd what is it about printers, especially,\nthat a reservation would be good for?\n\n68\n00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.300\nWhat will we do there?\n\n69\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.446\n&gt;&gt; So printers are very important, Ronnie,\nbecause, think about the logic behind it.\n\n70\n00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:47.320\nIf you're utilizing dynamic addressing for\nprinters, and I set up.\n\n71\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.180\nAnd we've already talked about printers.\n\n72\n00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.000\nAnd if I set that up, and\nthe end users are trying to connect and\n\n73\n00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.580\nestablish that communication\nwith a configured printer.\n\n74\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.200\nAnd the IP address is\nchanging all the time, well,\n\n75\n00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.449\nthey're not gonna be able to connect.\n\n76\n00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.605\nYou'll have to run around and reconfigure\nall those printers all the time, and\n\n77\n00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:04.742\nwho wants to do that?\n\n78\n00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:06.420\nThat just sounds like a nightmare.\n\n79\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.210\nSo, hey, why don't we set\nthose IP addresses statically?\n\n80\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.790\nGo ahead, create those reservations.\n\n81\n00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.810\nWe know what the IP address is and\nwe just have a better handle on things.\n\n82\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.920\nAs a matter of fact, really, talking about\nprinters, I love to simplify things.\n\n83\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.510\nAnd I know this isn't a printer show,\n\n84\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.300\nbut making things easier is\nreally what it's all about.\n\n85\n00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.270\nUsing DHCP to your advantage,\nreducing the amount of variables, I guess,\n\n86\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.130\nis the main thing here.\n\n87\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.470\nSo reduce a lot of different, if you have\nthe ability to a lot of different mix and\n\n88\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.280\nmodels, keep it the same so\nyou have less driver issues.\n\n89\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.750\nAnd even using DHCP, to number those\nIP addresses in a logical way.\n\n90\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.150\nSo maybe one through ten from my\nlast octet there I could number it.\n\n91\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.360\nAnd I would know, okay,\nanything with this type of IP\n\n92\n00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.710\naddress if it falls within this range,\nthose are my printers.\n\n93\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.310\nSo network management and even\nidentifying any kind of rogue devices or\n\n94\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.570\nfalse IP addresses on your network.\n\n95\n00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.010\nThat may help you with\nthe management of that as well.\n\n96\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.535\nSo just something to think about there.\n\n97\n00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:10.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nyou were talking about PowerShell.\n\n98\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.320\nSo help us to configure what\nwe need to here in PowerShell.\n\n99\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.280\n&gt;&gt; That's right, Ronnie, we can use\nPowerShell to set a reservation as well.\n\n100\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.580\nSo let's take a look at\nmy screen right here.\n\n101\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.185\nThe cmdlet that we're gonna be\nusing is going to be add-dhcp.\n\n102\n00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:31.624\nThis is going to be a server version 4\nlike we've been typing in, Serverv4.\n\n103\n00:05:31.624 --> 00:05:34.217\nWe're gonna set a reservation.\n\n104\n00:05:38.362 --> 00:05:39.870\nWe need to specify that scope ID.\n\n105\n00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.900\nSo let's see, for this scope we'll\nuse that first scope as well.\n\n106\n00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.014\nSo we'll just say 192.168.1.0.\n\n107\n00:05:51.014 --> 00:05:57.170\nWe also need to put that IP address in,\nso IPAddress.\n\n108\n00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.650\nAnd the IP address that we could set here,\n\n109\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.320\nI just want to make sure I\nhaven't used it already.\n\n110\n00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.448\n192.168, this one could be,\n\n111\n00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:09.709\nlet's just say .1.5, all right.\n\n112\n00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:14.790\nAnd I need to use that MAC address.\n\n113\n00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.846\nSo here I'm going to specify client ID,\nand\n\n114\n00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:20.720\nthis is gonna be that MAC address here.\n\n115\n00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.464\nAnd so\nhere I have in my notes like a legit\n\n116\n00:06:26.464 --> 00:06:31.512\nfake MAC address, so we'll say,\n\n117\n00:06:31.512 --> 00:06:39.040\nF1-5D-4B-00-3C-81, all right.\n\n118\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.340\nI can also add a description.\n\n119\n00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:44.795\nThe description here.\n\n120\n00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:45.900\nOops, If I can spell that right.\n\n121\n00:06:52.093 --> 00:06:55.060\nThe description I want to specify as.\n\n122\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.290\nAnd it's too funny,\nI know I have noted sales printer but\n\n123\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.830\nwe already had a sales printer.\n\n124\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.220\nAll right,so let's just\nsay marketing printer.\n\n125\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.169\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n126\n00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:08.838\n&gt;&gt; All right and then hit Enter, so\n\n127\n00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:12.950\nthat's a reservation right\nthere within PowerShell.\n\n128\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.170\nWe could even check here\njust to show you in the GUI.\n\n129\n00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.980\nWe might have to hit that\nrefresh option here, or\n\n130\n00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.410\neven on my IPv4 section there,\nfor that refresh.\n\n131\n00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.480\nAnd then look at my reservations again.\n\n132\n00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:37.509\nZoom in, you can see that that\nreservation has been set, 192.168.1.5.\n\n133\n00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:40.717\n[SOUND] It's kind of interesting, it\ndoesn't say Marketing Printer next to it,\n\n134\n00:07:40.717 --> 00:07:42.331\neven though we have set that parameter.\n\n135\n00:07:42.331 --> 00:07:45.830\nBut that just may be the way\nthe GUI renders that information.\n\n136\n00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.190\n&gt;&gt; Now before you go one from there,\n\n137\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.140\nlet's take a look at that, at what\nwe see there in the center section.\n\n138\n00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.430\nSo you zoom in just a-\n&gt;&gt; In the center pane?\n\n139\n00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.602\nSo yeah.\n&gt;&gt; As Cherokee zooms back in here, so\n\n140\n00:07:55.602 --> 00:07:59.005\nthat we can see something just briefly.\n\n141\n00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:02.254\nBecause if you're still kind of\nyou know fuzzy like, all right, so\n\n142\n00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:06.187\nthat's gonna allow me to re-assign that\nIP address back to this printer, well,\n\n143\n00:08:06.187 --> 00:08:08.649\nwhat's the big deal about\nsetting a reservation?\n\n144\n00:08:08.649 --> 00:08:12.350\nWhy not do it statically in\nwhat we're talking about?\n\n145\n00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.440\nRemember that the idea behind the DHTP is,\nwell, the inclusion of those options.\n\n146\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.020\nNotice that Cherokee didn't\nhave to type in what?\n\n147\n00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.310\nThe router or the default gateway for\nthat printer if she really needs that.\n\n148\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.482\nIf it's already set up in the scope as far\nas the options go, well, then that can\n\n149\n00:08:29.482 --> 00:08:33.156\nalso be handed out to that printer as\nwell without her having to go in and\n\n150\n00:08:33.156 --> 00:08:34.934\nmanually configure all of that.\n\n151\n00:08:34.934 --> 00:08:39.186\nSo when you do setup a static IP address,\nif you remember on a server,, right,\n\n152\n00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.865\nyou've gotta add all that\nother information in.\n\n153\n00:08:41.865 --> 00:08:45.848\nYour DNS servers, your default gateway,\nand whatever else you want to hand out.\n\n154\n00:08:45.848 --> 00:08:49.144\nBut now, by setting that up and\ngiving that same thing,\n\n155\n00:08:49.144 --> 00:08:53.016\nthe options are what makes this\ndynamic option actually better.\n\n156\n00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:55.864\nAnd something that's really good for\nprinters,\n\n157\n00:08:55.864 --> 00:08:58.590\nespecially if we need that situation.\n\n158\n00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.371\nSo it is a distinguishing feature.\n\n159\n00:09:01.371 --> 00:09:04.820\nIt is something that you may actually go,\nI don't wanna go around and\n\n160\n00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.615\nconfigure this for 15 printers.\n\n161\n00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:10.415\nWell, do it this way and it's actually\ngonna be easier for you in the end.\n\n162\n00:09:10.415 --> 00:09:14.475\n&gt;&gt; It really is, Ronnie, and that's\nthe old adage work, smarter not harder,\n\n163\n00:09:14.475 --> 00:09:16.355\nthis is a perfect example of that.\n\n164\n00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:20.535\nBecause not only am I saving time, but\nI'm also reducing the amount of errors.\n\n165\n00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:24.115\nIf I spend more time paying attention\nto that inital configuration,\n\n166\n00:09:24.115 --> 00:09:26.965\nthen I don't have to worry\nabout it throughout.\n\n167\n00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:29.519\nSo, just a few things\nto think about there.\n\n168\n00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:33.681\nOf course, I do need to have my Mac\naddress with this particular option.\n\n169\n00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:36.470\nSo that's something I would need to spend\na little bit more time making sure I\n\n170\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.142\ngathered that correct information up here.\n\n171\n00:09:38.142 --> 00:09:40.539\nAnd something else I'd\nlike to even point out.\n\n172\n00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:44.334\nIf we had created particular\nexclusions for a scope,\n\n173\n00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:49.915\nI could also set reservations for an IP\naddress that has been excluded as well.\n\n174\n00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:55.048\nSo, just know that those two things aren't\ngoing to clash or anything like that.\n\n175\n00:09:55.048 --> 00:10:00.295\nNow, let's go back into PowerShell,\nbecause there is a netsh command.\n\n176\n00:10:00.295 --> 00:10:03.901\nI just wanna show that as well, as\na different way that we could go ahead and\n\n177\n00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:04.899\nset a reservation.\n\n178\n00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:12.392\nAll right, so for our netsh command, let's\ngo ahead and type in netsh dhcp server.\n\n179\n00:10:12.392 --> 00:10:15.044\nLet's specify our server scope here.\n\n180\n00:10:15.044 --> 00:10:22.448\nOur scope, let's use that same scope\nthat we have been, 192.168.1.0.\n\n181\n00:10:22.448 --> 00:10:26.842\nAnd then we need to say add, and\n\n182\n00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:33.435\nthis is going to be reservedip,\nreservedip.\n\n183\n00:10:33.435 --> 00:10:40.885\nNow we need to specify that IP address and\nI don't think we're using .1.6.\n\n184\n00:10:40.885 --> 00:10:47.390\nThe only other thing we need to enter is\ngoing to be our Mac address, no spaces.\n\n185\n00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.410\nSo we'll put in, F15d, and\nthis is just a fake Mac address.\n\n186\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:55.435\nRemember, this will be whatever\nthat actual device address is.\n\n187\n00:10:55.435 --> 00:10:59.951\nSo that is d4b00 and\n\n188\n00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:03.519\nthis is 3c82.\n\n189\n00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:08.090\nWe'll hit Enter.\n\n190\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.010\nAnd it says that the command\nhas completed successfully, so\n\n191\n00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.610\nthat reservation should also be set.\n\n192\n00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.920\nIf I wanted to go back here and\ncheck it, remember,\n\n193\n00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.700\nI'm probably gonna have to hit that\nrefresh just to show that here.\n\n194\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.356\nBut you can see it just pop in,\n\n195\n00:11:22.356 --> 00:11:26.086\nand there's my third reservation\nthat we've set, right there.\n\n196\n00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.971\nSo a couple different ways to do it.\n\n197\n00:11:27.971 --> 00:11:31.337\nJust wanted to make sure that\nwe're covering all of those for\n\n198\n00:11:31.337 --> 00:11:32.460\nour reservations.\n\n199\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.955\nSomething else I want to mention, though,\n\n200\n00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:38.622\nwhat if we are talking about IP addresses,\nright?\n\n201\n00:11:38.622 --> 00:11:40.672\nThat's the whole concept here behind DHCP.\n\n202\n00:11:40.672 --> 00:11:44.710\nAnd we have already set up\nthree different scopes.\n\n203\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:48.760\nBut what happens if I'm starting\nto run out of IP addresses\n\n204\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.850\nin one of those particular scopes?\n\n205\n00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.190\nWell, wouldn't it be nice if there was a\nway where we could aggregate some of those\n\n206\n00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.790\nscopes together and\ncreate one large scope?\n\n207\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.200\nWell, guess what?\n\n208\n00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.045\nThere is, Ronnie.\n\n209\n00:12:00.045 --> 00:12:02.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Couple different names here.\n\n210\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.820\nSuperscope or supernet.\n\n211\n00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.320\nYou might see it either way.\n\n212\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.970\nI think on the objectives,\nthey call it out as supernet.\n\n213\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.680\nBut here in the operating system, in the\ncommandlets that you use, it's superscope.\n\n214\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.621\nSo don't let that hang you up.\n\n215\n00:12:13.621 --> 00:12:16.830\nIt just means, hey, we're taking\nthose smaller individual scopes and\n\n216\n00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.363\nkind of pushing them together and\ncreating a larger one.\n\n217\n00:12:19.363 --> 00:12:19.980\n&gt;&gt; Manage them.\n\n218\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.649\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so of course,\njust like with everything else,\n\n219\n00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:27.200\nyou can do that within\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n220\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.560\nWe can also do that here\nwithin your DHCP console, but\n\n221\n00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.010\nwe can also do that within\nPowerShell as well.\n\n222\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.680\nSo let's see what that would\nlook like here in PowerShell.\n\n223\n00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.360\nLet me clear my screen out.\n\n224\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.150\nSo of course, you're gonna need to know\nsome of the information about that network\n\n225\n00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.540\nto put in the scope IDs here.\n\n226\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.985\nBut it's pretty simple, aside from that.\n\n227\n00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:52.968\nThe commandlet that we'll be\nusing is going to be add-dhcp.\n\n228\n00:12:52.968 --> 00:13:01.770\nThis is going to be Serverv4SuperScope.\n\n229\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:08.700\nWe need to specify the SuperScope name,\nand that name, what do we wanna call it?\n\n230\n00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:16.020\nHow about the DemoSuperScope.\n\n231\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.766\nWe need to specify the scope IDs that\nwill be included within this SuperScope\n\n232\n00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:20.417\nright here.\n\n233\n00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:26.413\nSo let's say, scope ID for 192.168.1.0.\n\n234\n00:13:26.413 --> 00:13:32.080\nOops, comma separated, add in.\n\n235\n00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.530\nSo you have to have at least\ntwo scopes to put together.\n\n236\n00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.487\nWe can put three in here.\n\n237\n00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:41.400\nSince we have three, or we could add two,\nwhatever, it doesn't matter.\n\n238\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:48.482\n192.168.2.0, I'm kinda\ngoing off the screen here.\n\n239\n00:13:48.482 --> 00:13:51.601\nLet me just scroll over and\nyou can see that, so that's good.\n\n240\n00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:58.121\nWe at least have two, I'll hit Enter and\nthat is going to be it for creating it.\n\n241\n00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:00.088\nOf course, you can set different options.\n\n242\n00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:04.843\nBut let me just go back and\n\n243\n00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:11.871\ntype in Get-dhcpServerv4Scope.\n\n244\n00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:15.560\nThis is the same command that we have\nused before to create a format list of\n\n245\n00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.800\nthe different scopes that were available.\n\n246\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.210\nBut now I want you to note something.\n\n247\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.559\nLet's see.\n\n248\n00:14:27.384 --> 00:14:31.398\nWhen we look at the individual\ninformation for these scopes,\n\n249\n00:14:31.398 --> 00:14:35.271\nI want you to pay attention to\nscope number one, all right?\n\n250\n00:14:35.271 --> 00:14:40.180\nSuperScopeName, it is part of\nDemoSuperScope, right here.\n\n251\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.854\nAnd then for Scope number two,\nit is part of DemoSuperScope here.\n\n252\n00:14:44.854 --> 00:14:48.760\nAnd remember we decided not\nto add SuperScope three.\n\n253\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.438\nSo if I look at the information for\nour Scope number three, and\n\n254\n00:14:52.438 --> 00:14:57.061\nthen under the section there for\nSuperScope Name, there's nothing there.\n\n255\n00:14:57.061 --> 00:15:02.880\nSo that's its own separate entity,\nif you will, again.\n\n256\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.775\nSo that's just one way\nthat we could do that.\n\n257\n00:15:04.775 --> 00:15:07.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the GUI, as well.\n\n258\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.275\nI think there's a visual change there.\n\n259\n00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:12.330\n&gt;&gt; All right, yeah, let's go ahead and\nswitch back into the GUI here and\n\n260\n00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.250\ntake a look at that now.\n\n261\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.080\nWe may need to, again,\nhit the refresh option here.\n\n262\n00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.764\nSo let's go ahead and do that, refresh.\n\n263\n00:15:20.764 --> 00:15:23.606\nAnd if I zoom in, on the left-hand side,\n\n264\n00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:28.088\nwe can now see that this folder\nsays Superscope DemoSuperScope.\n\n265\n00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:32.429\nAnd then the individual scoops\nare gonna be listed as subobjects or\n\n266\n00:15:32.429 --> 00:15:36.990\ncomponents here for our Scope1 and\n2 that we had added in.\n\n267\n00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.259\nSo it's pretty cool,\nyou can manage it either way.\n\n268\n00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:44.581\nIf I wanted to, let's say,\nso I can't put Scope2 and\n\n269\n00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:47.723\na new Superscope with Scope3.\n\n270\n00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:51.766\nBut if I had Scope4,\nthen I wanted to create a new scope,\n\n271\n00:15:51.766 --> 00:15:54.303\nI could do that with Scope4 and 3.\n\n272\n00:15:54.303 --> 00:15:58.744\nBut if I wanted to create that\nright here from within the GUI,\n\n273\n00:15:58.744 --> 00:16:03.200\njust right-click on top of IPv4,\ncreate New Superscope.\n\n274\n00:16:04.243 --> 00:16:07.671\nAnd then I'd have a little GUI,\na wizard that I could walk through.\n\n275\n00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:11.960\nSame process, same idea,\nnot too difficult there.\n\n276\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.700\nBut that's how we would\ngo about doing that.\n\n277\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the requirement remember Cherokee\ndid mention this, there needs to be at\n\n278\n00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:22.510\nleast by two if you're gonna do this in\nterms of the scopes that are active and\n\n279\n00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.350\nreadily available if you're\ngonna create the superscope.\n\n280\n00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.738\nYou can add more of course than,\nbut it has to be a minimum of two.\n\n281\n00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.854\nSo if you start off with one and\ngo, I wanna create a Superscope,\n\n282\n00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:35.790\nyou're gonna need at least add one\nmore in there before you can do that.\n\n283\n00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.391\nAll right, so\n\n284\n00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:39.854\nCherokee now that we understand a little\nbit more about using the reservations and\n\n285\n00:16:39.854 --> 00:16:43.087\nalso of course this idea superscope,\nwhat else are we taking a look at here?\n\n286\n00:16:43.087 --> 00:16:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie there are a couple of different\noptions that we could configure as well.\n\n287\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.801\nI think we'll save that for the next show\nbecause they're a little bit lengthy.\n\n288\n00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:55.230\nSomething that doesn't take a lot of time\nthat we should also think about as well,\n\n289\n00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.129\ncreating backups for DHCP.\n\n290\n00:16:57.129 --> 00:17:01.924\nNow, well you should have a corporate\nbackup solution in place, but\n\n291\n00:17:01.924 --> 00:17:05.478\nif I wanted to make any kind\nof changes within DHCP,\n\n292\n00:17:05.478 --> 00:17:10.127\nit's always a smart idea to backup\nbefore you go ahead and do that.\n\n293\n00:17:10.127 --> 00:17:13.565\nSo let me just show you a way that you\ncould do that right here from within\n\n294\n00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:14.280\nPowerShell.\n\n295\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.058\nIt's pretty quick,\npretty simple, pretty easy.\n\n296\n00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:19.540\nAll right, let's clear the screen.\n\n297\n00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:26.141\nNow the syntax is going to be backup, So\n\n298\n00:17:26.141 --> 00:17:29.319\nthis is going to be backup-dhcpserver.\n\n299\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.749\nExcuse me, that is not a space there.\n\n300\n00:17:35.749 --> 00:17:37.046\nIt's all together.\n\n301\n00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:45.540\nAnd so the default location, the operating\nsystem creates is going to be that if\n\n302\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:52.140\nyou use this through the GUI, it's going\nto be under your System32 file folder.\n\n303\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.930\nYou could specify an alternate\nto location, but for\n\n304\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.030\nnow we're just gonna\nkeep that default path.\n\n305\n00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:02.334\nSo I'm just gonna go with path underneath\n\n306\n00:18:02.334 --> 00:18:07.949\nmy C drive here, \\Windows\\system32.\n\n307\n00:18:07.949 --> 00:18:13.583\nThis is going to be a folder called dhcp,\n\n308\n00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:18.897\nand then we'll ahead and say backup.\n\n309\n00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.850\nAnd we'll hit Enter.\n\n310\n00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.785\nLet's see.\n\n311\n00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:28.057\nI need to have a space there,\nand I've never ran that backup,\n\n312\n00:18:28.057 --> 00:18:32.360\nso I don't know if that folder is\nactually existing here, let's see.\n\n313\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.570\nAll right, so let me go ahead and\ncreate that backup there.\n\n314\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.875\nNow if we wanted to test that,\nyou could go in and check.\n\n315\n00:18:38.875 --> 00:18:43.725\nThe types of information that will be\nbacked up in one of those configuration\n\n316\n00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:47.965\nfile such as .mdb your .pat for\nthe backup is going to be all of your\n\n317\n00:18:47.965 --> 00:18:52.015\nscopes including Superscopes and\nmulticast scopes.\n\n318\n00:18:52.015 --> 00:18:55.780\nAny kind of reservations or\nleases that you've set,\n\n319\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.670\nall of those options that we've\ntalked about like that router,\n\n320\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.780\nthat special configuration and\nthat we had set there.\n\n321\n00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.810\nAnd also registry keys and\nother configuration examples.\n\n322\n00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.540\nSo, all that information is going to be\nenclosed whenever you create that backup.\n\n323\n00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.900\nSo, that's pretty nice.\n\n324\n00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.020\nIf we wanted to perform\na test of that real quick,\n\n325\n00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.410\nwe could do that as well, let's see.\n\n326\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.430\nIf I go back into my\nDHCP management console.\n\n327\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.763\nAnd, lets just say, I was feeling crazy,\nand I wasn't sure what I was doing and\n\n328\n00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:24.979\nI just wanted to delete this scope here.\n\n329\n00:19:24.979 --> 00:19:26.290\nI could do that, all right?\n\n330\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.860\nSo we're gonna delete scope number three.\n\n331\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.805\nIt asks me if I'm wanna go and\ncreate that scope, I say yes.\n\n332\n00:19:31.805 --> 00:19:34.524\nBut then I realized,\nRonnie I made a mistake,\n\n333\n00:19:34.524 --> 00:19:37.880\nI really didn't wanna\ndelete scope number three.\n\n334\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.669\nSo not a big deal,\nas long as I created that backup,\n\n335\n00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:47.147\nthen all I have to do here, let me just\nclear my screen I can hit my up arrow.\n\n336\n00:19:47.147 --> 00:19:50.580\nAnd the only difference is\ngoing to be instead of backup,\n\n337\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.450\nlet's just change that\nto restore right here.\n\n338\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.620\nAnd it should pull that change back in.\n\n339\n00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.762\nAnd then we can test it, also.\n\n340\n00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:02.774\nAll right, now when it asks you,\n\n341\n00:20:02.774 --> 00:20:07.520\nthink about this from a production\nenvironment perspective.\n\n342\n00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.326\nWe never really wanna be stopping and\n\n343\n00:20:09.326 --> 00:20:13.533\nrestarting coordinate work services within\nan environment especially if I have to.\n\n344\n00:20:13.533 --> 00:20:16.510\nOkay, let's see here.\n\n345\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:21.160\nI'm gonna hit Yes, it's just asking me,\ndo I want to perform this restoration.\n\n346\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.510\nBut it's going to say, please restart.\n\n347\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.430\nThis is the one I was really looking for\nhere.\n\n348\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.934\nPlease restart the DHCP server.\n\n349\n00:20:27.934 --> 00:20:32.145\nNow, restarting servers in\nthe production environment is something\n\n350\n00:20:32.145 --> 00:20:35.798\nyou really have to think about\nto maintain with your up time.\n\n351\n00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:38.678\nAnd you really don't have to restart,\n\n352\n00:20:38.678 --> 00:20:42.875\nyou just have to stop and\nrestart that DHCP service here.\n\n353\n00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:47.985\nBecause if you think about what if\nmaybe really it's not best practice,\n\n354\n00:20:47.985 --> 00:20:53.290\nlike we mentioned, to have a multi\nfunction sever here running your DHCP.\n\n355\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.917\nBut maybe you're not financially\navailable to do that and\n\n356\n00:20:57.917 --> 00:21:00.661\nhave multiple dedicated severs.\n\n357\n00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:05.120\nSo you don't wanna disrupt any kind\nof services that may be running.\n\n358\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.520\nSo let's check that before we\nactually stop and restart there.\n\n359\n00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.874\nActually we need to do this first.\n\n360\n00:21:11.874 --> 00:21:13.582\nLet's check the current state.\n\n361\n00:21:13.582 --> 00:21:18.264\nSo let's just do a get-service,\nto get this DHCP service and\n\n362\n00:21:18.264 --> 00:21:21.154\nsee what's happening with it so far.\n\n363\n00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.527\nAll right, so\nwe can see that it's running.\n\n364\n00:21:26.527 --> 00:21:29.430\nThat's our current state\nof our DHCP service.\n\n365\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:33.170\nSo what I wanna do is just instead\nof performing a full restart,\n\n366\n00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:39.320\nI'm gonna do Stop-Service and\nagain, that's going to be my DHCP.\n\n367\n00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.381\nSo we're just gonna\ntype in our DHCP server\n\n368\n00:21:47.092 --> 00:21:50.872\nAll right, you could also do the get\njust to verify if you're, oops!\n\n369\n00:21:53.978 --> 00:21:58.410\nIf you're paranoid like me,\nyou can see that it is stopped right here.\n\n370\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.770\nAll right, and then again,\nthe next one to restart it is very simple.\n\n371\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.860\nIt's just Start-Service.\n\n372\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.390\nAgain you specify that DHCP server.\n\n373\n00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.060\nAll right and then again,\nif you wanna double check that.\n\n374\n00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.504\nOkay, so\nit's waiting to go ahead and start.\n\n375\n00:22:16.504 --> 00:22:20.575\nAnd then in the GUI, you just see\nthat little ancient clock that starts\n\n376\n00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:24.381\ngoing through if you were to go\nahead stop and restart it that way.\n\n377\n00:22:27.486 --> 00:22:28.463\nLet's just check it.\n\n378\n00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:33.765\nWe can see that it's running.\n\n379\n00:22:33.765 --> 00:22:37.640\nSo, I just like to check it to make\nsure that what we're doing is actually\n\n380\n00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.490\nworking here.\n\n381\n00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:43.282\nBut if we go back into the graphical user\ninterface, you can see right from within\n\n382\n00:22:43.282 --> 00:22:47.596\nthat console and of course we will need\nto go ahead and hit Refresh again.\n\n383\n00:22:50.206 --> 00:22:54.520\nLet's expand out, or\nzoom in, I should say.\n\n384\n00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.110\nSo there's that Superscope, but\nlook, there's Scope number 3.\n\n385\n00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.110\nAnd that's the scope\nthat we had just deleted.\n\n386\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:06.438\nBy utilizing backups,\nwe were able to pull that scope right back\n\n387\n00:23:06.438 --> 00:23:12.271\nin averting any kind of disaster or\npotential firing type situation.\n\n388\n00:23:12.271 --> 00:23:15.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, there you have it.\n\n389\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.840\nJust a few quick things I wanted to\nshow at the end of this episode.\n\n390\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.660\nBut there are a couple other configuration\noptions that I would like to cover, so\n\n391\n00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.850\nplease stay tuned for them.\n\n392\n00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.949\nAll right, Cherokee, thank you again by\nhelping us out here and taking a look at\n\n393\n00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:32.854\nsome of these other options that we might\nwant to think about as we go ahead and\n\n394\n00:23:32.854 --> 00:23:34.399\ncontinue to configure DHCP.\n\n395\n00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:38.457\nThere is more to come, but there's a lot\nof great exam elements that we've just\n\n396\n00:23:38.457 --> 00:23:41.080\nlooked at, especially in this episode.\n\n397\n00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.180\nSo slow down and make sure you understand\nthose different components and\n\n398\n00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:48.660\nthose pieces to them, because you will\nfind them to be pretty much tested\n\n399\n00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.200\nin more ways than you can actually think.\n\n400\n00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.110\nAll right, that's a great place for\nus to go ahead and end this episode then.\n\n401\n00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.890\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n402\n00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.950\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose\n\n403\n00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.424\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\n\n404\n00:24:01.424 --> 00:24:03.675\nmore of

host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.759\nToday, we're actually gonna part\nfour on configuring and, of course,\n\n9\n00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.680\nmaking sure that we understand DHCP.\n\n10\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.720\nYou might be wondering how we're\nactually going to do a little bit more.\n\n11\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.350\nBut here to explain what we're actually\ngonna be doing is gonna be Ms.\n\n12\n00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.130\nCherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.370\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n14\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me Ronnie.\n\n15\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.960\nI know it seems like we've been\ncovering a lot here with DHCP,\n\n16\n00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.870\nbut that's because there's a lot to DHCP.\n\n17\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.810\nAnd you know what?\n\n18\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.302\nI think that for this show,\nmaybe this will be our last DHCP episode.\n\n19\n00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:52.768\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure but either way,\n\n20\n00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:54.840\nI wanted to do a quick recap.\n\n21\n00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.000\nAnd then I wanted to introduce a couple of\nmore options that we can configure, and\n\n22\n00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.430\nif you remember,\nwe did speak about options before.\n\n23\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.540\nBut I just wanna kinda go over those\none more time because I know it can be\n\n24\n00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.420\na little confusing if\nit's brand new to you.\n\n25\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280\nAnd lastly there's a cool concept called\nDHCP relay that I want to introduce and\n\n26\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.630\nthen show you how to configure it.\n\n27\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.200\nSo we do have a lot to do.\n\n28\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.840\nLet's go ahead and get started.\n\n29\n00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.520\nIf you would mind joining\nme here right in my screen.\n\n30\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.663\nI have server one pulled up.\n\n31\n00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:23.669\nAnd l have couple of\ndifferent scopes set up for\n\n32\n00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:26.460\nthe demonstration that we'll be\ngetting into in a few moments.\n\n33\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.840\nBut l just wanted to remind\nyou of the order of precedence\n\n34\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.550\nthat we were talking about\nwith our scope options here.\n\n35\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.004\nSo if you can recall,\nwe had four different levels.\n\n36\n00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:39.960\nWe had the server level, we had our scope\nlevel, and then we also had our class and\n\n37\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.470\nvendor level.\n\n38\n00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.990\nFollowed then by our\nreserved client level,\n\n39\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.160\nwhich is only achieved whenever\nyou create a reservation.\n\n40\n00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.160\nAnd I can't remember if we covered that or\nnot.\n\n41\n00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.400\nBut it's okay if we look\nat it one more time.\n\n42\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.000\nSo we'll look at it here\nin this show as well.\n\n43\n00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.770\nBecause that order that I just said is\ngoing to be the order of precedence.\n\n44\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.030\nSo what that means, Ronnie, if I start\nup here with my server level, scope,\n\n45\n00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.370\nand then I go down to those classes,\nvendor or, all right, a client.\n\n46\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.280\nAnd then I go down to the reservation.\n\n47\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.170\nSo if I have three\nconflicting options prior to\n\n48\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.300\nthat fourth option down at the bottom for\nmy reserved client level.\n\n49\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.710\nThose other three are gonna just be\nwashed out because it always goes down to\n\n50\n00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.910\nthe bottom there of that hierarchy,\nif you think of it that way.\n\n51\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.010\nIf we ever have conflicting options,\n\n52\n00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.350\nthen the last one in that order is\ngoing to go ahead and rule out.\n\n53\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.400\nAnd if I can show you where those\noptions here are on the screen, just so\n\n54\n00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.700\nthat you are familiar.\n\n55\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.860\nSo the first one there for\nthe server level, so\n\n56\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.670\nthis is going to be your server options.\n\n57\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.040\nAnd I'll just zoom in a little\nbit there so you could see that.\n\n58\n00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.990\nWhoa, that's huge, but\nthose are your Server Options there.\n\n59\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.430\nAnd then, if we remember,\nI'll try to zoom out a little bit.\n\n60\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.920\nFor our Scope Options,\n\n61\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.000\nthat will be next right here behind\nmy little magnifying glass there.\n\n62\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.960\nBut that's for the second order.\n\n63\n00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.850\nAnd then remember if we right-click\non top of IPv4, this is that section.\n\n64\n00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.980\nIn the last show I think it is,\nwe actually, let's see,\n\n65\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.710\ndefined user class and\ndefined vendor class.\n\n66\n00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.170\nThose are gonna be the, that is\nthe section where you will configure\n\n67\n00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.860\nthat tertiary, I said that right, yeah?\n\n68\n00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.068\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's the third level of\n\n69\n00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:25.880\nprecedence there.\n\n70\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.930\nSo that's where you'll go ahead and\nset that, if that makes sense.\n\n71\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.570\nAnd then the last one is\ngoing to be reserved for\n\n72\n00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.850\nreservations, no pun intended there.\n\n73\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.240\nBut if we can take a look here,\nI have a scope and my ten dots go up here.\n\n74\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.110\nI created a reservation for Ronnie's PC.\n\n75\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.420\nAnd then if I right-click\non top of Ronnie's PC,\n\n76\n00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.460\nthis is going to be the section where\nI can configure those options which\n\n77\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.360\nultimately override any of those previous\noptions that we just mentioned there.\n\n78\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.020\nSo just kind of keep that in mind.\n\n79\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.235\nAnd that order of precedence\nis pretty important there.\n\n80\n00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:02.128\nThere's a lot to think about with DHCP.\n\n81\n00:04:02.128 --> 00:04:06.873\nBut I wanted to talk about some\nadditional options that can really affect\n\n82\n00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:09.690\nthe way that the system Is running.\n\n83\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.424\nAnd, Ronnie, with PXE boot,\n\n84\n00:04:11.424 --> 00:04:15.719\nhave you ever had to work with that in\na working environment setting that up?\n\n85\n00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:19.446\n&gt;&gt; I have, in terms of PXE boot\nthere's a lot of times where when\n\n86\n00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:23.285\nyou're trying to do the idea\nof Windows Deployment Servers.\n\n87\n00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:23.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n88\n00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.790\nyou need to actually be able to do that,\n\n89\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.980\nPXE boot is one of the best\nways to get that all set up.\n\n90\n00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.910\nIf you don't have an operating\nsystem existing on the machines\n\n91\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.070\nthat you want to deploy\nan operating system to.\n\n92\n00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.050\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty convenient, a lot of\ncompanies are using it these days.\n\n93\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.690\nSo if we just look at the acronym there,\n\n94\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.410\nthat's going to be your\npre-execution environment.\n\n95\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.390\nMeaning I can have a computer, a laptop,\n\n96\n00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.385\na VOIP phone, some device that does not\nrequire any kind of integrated hardware,\n\n97\n00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:53.520\nwell, some hardware but\nnot like a hard drive.\n\n98\n00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.600\nI'm getting my boot information\nfrom another source.\n\n99\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.480\nSo in that situation that you explained,\nRonnie,\n\n100\n00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.080\nyou were using\na Windows Deployment Server,\n\n101\n00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.130\nwhich is a really common\nMicrosoft implementation.\n\n102\n00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.420\nBut there is something that we do need to\nconfigure in order to set that up, and\n\n103\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.170\nit's right here within our DHCP options.\n\n104\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.690\nNow depending on exactly\nhow you set that up.\n\n105\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.600\nSo for instance, if I just go under my\nServer Options here, there may be a couple\n\n106\n00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.770\ndifferent instances where you\nneed to select different options.\n\n107\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.330\nBut for right now,\n\n108\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.260\nwhat I want to show is just how to\nset this up in a normal situation.\n\n109\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.432\nBecause if I'm gonna be configuring with\nmy PXE boot and DHCP to be on separate\n\n110\n00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:38.336\nservers, then we have to configure remote\nboot servers to communicate with port 67.\n\n111\n00:05:38.336 --> 00:05:42.504\nThe DHCP server must not\ninclude server option 60,\n\n112\n00:05:42.504 --> 00:05:46.890\nif your PXE boot and\nyour DHCP are on the same server.\n\n113\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.680\nSo that just might be a slight difference.\n\n114\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.180\nIf you're setting it up a little bit\ndifferently, it just depends on where your\n\n115\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.870\nDHCP is residing versus the actual\nPXE server, that PXE point there.\n\n116\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.680\nSo in my situation,\n\n117\n00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.210\nwhat I wanna make sure I have configured,\nthere are two options here.\n\n118\n00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.615\nAnd the first is going to be option 66.\n\n119\n00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.530\nAnd let me just scroll down and\nfind that one.\n\n120\n00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.660\nAnd I'll need to put a little\nbit of information in\n\n121\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.780\nin order to go ahead and do that.\n\n122\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.850\nWe're getting there here.\n\n123\n00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.540\nAll right, I didn't wanna go\ntoo far past and miss it.\n\n124\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.150\nSo what I could put here, and\nlet me zoom in so you can see that.\n\n125\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.260\nFor our string value I'm gonna\nneed to put in the name of\n\n126\n00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.920\nmy Windows Deployment Server or\nthe IP address here.\n\n127\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.421\nSo if I just put in something random,\nwe could say .100,\n\n128\n00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:35.550\nall right, and then hit OK.\n\n129\n00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.940\nThe next option that I would also\nneed to configure here will be 67.\n\n130\n00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.071\nSo let me just go ahead and\npull that up and\n\n131\n00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:44.336\nshow you what that would\nlook like as well.\n\n132\n00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:48.987\nScrolling, there we go.\n\n133\n00:06:48.987 --> 00:06:50.345\nNow for the string value for\n\n134\n00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:54.910\nthis particular one we're gonna be putting\nsomething a little more specific here.\n\n135\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.780\nI need to really reference\nthat actual image file for\n\n136\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.470\nwhatever operating system or\nimage that I'm using here.\n\n137\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.131\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and select this.\n\n138\n00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:08.292\nSo let's say that this is where\nthat particular file was residing,\n\n139\n00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:10.926\njust an example of what\nit would look like.\n\n140\n00:07:10.926 --> 00:07:16.786\nWD, what is this going to be, wdsnbp.\n\n141\n00:07:16.786 --> 00:07:21.990\nAnd that's just a .wimfile there,\nor it could be .com.\n\n142\n00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.500\nHowever that's going to be set\nup within your environment, but\n\n143\n00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.090\nthose are the two options that\nyou would go ahead and select.\n\n144\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.794\nAnd, of course, you know we've got\nour apply here or just hit OK.\n\n145\n00:07:31.794 --> 00:07:36.651\nApply being the extra option,\nlike the extra step here to go ahead and\n\n146\n00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:38.510\npush it out immediately.\n\n147\n00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.410\nBut OK does the same thing,\nso don't worry about that.\n\n148\n00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.206\nSo that would be how you\ncould configure PXE, and so\n\n149\n00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:51.225\nit's really great in environments where\nmaybe you don't have IT staff on site.\n\n150\n00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:53.430\nYou're talking about a remote office and\n\n151\n00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.970\nyou don't have someone to actually\nperform the hardware repair.\n\n152\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.319\nAnd you can just really do a quick and\n\n153\n00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:04.580\neasy hardware swap out if a machine was\nbad or had some kind of hardware failure.\n\n154\n00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.358\nSo it's a pretty easy\nconfiguration if you are using\n\n155\n00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:11.190\na Windows deployment server there,\nso pretty cool.\n\n156\n00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.351\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the only other requirement that\nyou have, especially with PXE boot, and\n\n157\n00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:18.608\nmost network adapters will go ahead and\nhave this as part of it.\n\n158\n00:08:18.608 --> 00:08:22.880\nSo when I first started,\nnot every network adapter was PXE enabled.\n\n159\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.050\nSo those legacy network adapters that\naren't PXE enabled, they won't be able to\n\n160\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.570\npick up this idea of PXE boot, and\ndoing everything else that it needs to.\n\n161\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.280\nBut in the situation\nthat we're talking about,\n\n162\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.660\nnormally when you boot the computer up and\nthe network adapter is PXE enabled,\n\n163\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.130\nyou'll see that as it\nflashes up across the screen.\n\n164\n00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.890\nAnd if you do have\nthe deployment server ready,\n\n165\n00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.400\nit means DHCP is gonna tell it where\nthat deployment server is, and\n\n166\n00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.160\nthat's why we have to set the options\nup the way that Cherokee showed us.\n\n167\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.510\nAnd then, point to that so\nit can begin the communication process.\n\n168\n00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:59.200\nThe neat thing about this is that\nyou're really starting a machine, a PC,\n\n169\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.712\nat least in our example,\nwithout an operating system.\n\n170\n00:09:02.712 --> 00:09:07.111\nTelling it to really communicate and then\nbe able to actually do the remaining part\n\n171\n00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.228\nof the deployment that we want to on it.\n\n172\n00:09:09.228 --> 00:09:12.290\nSo that's about the only other requirement\nthat you have to make sure of.\n\n173\n00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.070\nToday, more than likely every,\nI'm gonna assume just about\n\n174\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.961\nevery NIC that you have out\nthere is probably PXE enabled,\n\n175\n00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:21.980\nyou just have to make\nsure that it can do that.\n\n176\n00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.060\nNow, if you have a previous operating\nsystem existing on there, such as what\n\n177\n00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.760\nCherokee was mentioning, let's just say\nthat the operating system got corrupted.\n\n178\n00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.208\nWhen somebody reboots that machine,\nthat's going to go ahead and\n\n179\n00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:36.794\ncontinue to reboot until you press\nthe key to tell it to go to PXE boot.\n\n180\n00:09:36.794 --> 00:09:40.038\nThat's the only time that you should\nneed to interfere with the process\n\n181\n00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:42.270\nof the boot when you have\nthe PXE boot ready to go.\n\n182\n00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.055\nSo brand new machine, no operating system,\nshould PXE boot right away.\n\n183\n00:09:46.055 --> 00:09:49.459\nAnd a machine that already has an existing\noperating system is going to boot\n\n184\n00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:52.160\nthe operating system,\nunless you stop it in its process and\n\n185\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.370\ntell it to do the PXE boot.\n\n186\n00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:57.295\nAll right, so Cherokee, understanding that\nidea, the PXE boot is really cool, and\n\n187\n00:09:57.295 --> 00:09:59.543\nI understand that DHCP is\na part of that process.\n\n188\n00:09:59.543 --> 00:10:01.762\nAnd the options that we\nneed to set up is good, so\n\n189\n00:10:01.762 --> 00:10:03.381\nwhat else are you taking a look at?\n\n190\n00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:06.946\n&gt;&gt; Yes Ronnie, thank you for reminding\nme of that, and as a matter of fact,\n\n191\n00:10:06.946 --> 00:10:08.758\nsomeone in the chat, Mike Stevens,\n\n192\n00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:12.399\nalso reminded me about enabling it\nin your BIOS, enabling PXE, as well.\n\n193\n00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:16.780\nAnd when we take a look at even Hyper-V,\nlooking at those network adapters the way\n\n194\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.300\nthat we're creating them,\nwe also need to consider that, but\n\n195\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.340\nwe'll touch more on that\nwhen we get into Hyper-V.\n\n196\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.574\nAnd then lastly, one more thing to\nconsider when you're setting up PXE boot,\n\n197\n00:10:25.574 --> 00:10:28.226\nif you're having any kind of issues,\nperhaps with a firewall.\n\n198\n00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:30.841\nYou might wanna go ahead and\ncheck out port 4011,\n\n199\n00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:34.747\ncuz that's gonna be the port for\ncommunication, usually we're using there.\n\n200\n00:10:34.747 --> 00:10:39.595\nSo just a few things to consider,\nbut I think that we'll go ahead and\n\n201\n00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:41.390\nwrap up for the options.\n\n202\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.190\nI know we've covered a lot,\nso we'll go ahead and\n\n203\n00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.080\nstart talking about something else,\ncalled DHCP relay agent.\n\n204\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.610\nSo if you can take a look at my screen,\nyou may have even heard it called a few\n\n205\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:56.150\ndifferent things, such as in Cisco,\nthey call it an IP helper.\n\n206\n00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.420\nBut really,\nif we're talking about a router or\n\n207\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.020\na machine that's RFC 1542 compliant,\n\n208\n00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.700\nmeaning that it'll adhere to the standards\nthat we're about to talk about.\n\n209\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.560\nIf we can take a look at this full screen,\nI just want to give you a picture\n\n210\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.190\nmentally, so when we're running\nthrough the demonstration,\n\n211\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.240\nyou can relate the configuration to\nsome kind of logical layout here.\n\n212\n00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:25.350\nSo for whatever reason,\nI have my network that is set up here.\n\n213\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:30.790\nMaybe I have a remote worker or some kind\nof remote office over here in the pink\n\n214\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.637\noff to my left, and then on the right\nhand side, I have DHCP server.\n\n215\n00:11:35.637 --> 00:11:40.745\nAnd if you think about just the logic\nof how routers work and how DHCP works,\n\n216\n00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:45.124\nand we spoke about that actual process,\nthat DORA process, and\n\n217\n00:11:45.124 --> 00:11:50.340\nwe think about that conversation,\nthat initiation, that's happening.\n\n218\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.360\nWe're utilizing broadcast transmission,\nand typically a router's not going to be\n\n219\n00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.250\nsupporting those broadcast transmissions,\nthat's the function of a normal router.\n\n220\n00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.510\nSo in order to modify that, there\nare a few things that I need to do and\n\n221\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.250\nI need to set up.\n\n222\n00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.553\nIn this situation, we're going to be using\na server and then running routing and\n\n223\n00:12:11.553 --> 00:12:16.265\nremote access, RRAS, on this server\nto allow it to act as a middleman.\n\n224\n00:12:16.265 --> 00:12:21.561\nAnd.that will turn those broadcast\ncommunications into unicast,\n\n225\n00:12:21.561 --> 00:12:24.400\nso that it can traverse that router.\n\n226\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.436\nSo for instance, that first step when\na client is communicating out looking for\n\n227\n00:12:29.436 --> 00:12:30.430\na DHCP router.\n\n228\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.900\nIf this were just a normal router,\n\n229\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.690\nit would stop those broadcast\ntransmissions, and then the poor client\n\n230\n00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.370\nwould never be able to communicate with\nthe DHCP server over here in our network.\n\n231\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.320\nSo by configuring DHCP relay agents,\n\n232\n00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.612\nwe're allowing that DHCP relay\nagent as kind of like a middleman.\n\n233\n00:12:50.612 --> 00:12:55.850\nAnd helps get that communication\nfrom the client to the DHCP server,\n\n234\n00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:00.710\nand then allows the communication from\nthe DHCP server to get back to the client.\n\n235\n00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.601\nSo I don't know if that makes sense,\n\n236\n00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:05.409\nlet's take a look at how we\nhave this configured here.\n\n237\n00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:07.571\nI have two network interface cards, so\n\n238\n00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:11.190\nI have two different subnets\nwithin my environment here.\n\n239\n00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.580\nI have a 192 over in the pink, and I just\ntried to color coordinate it because\n\n240\n00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.610\nI really want this to make sense to you.\n\n241\n00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:24.470\nSo when I configured these two network\ninterface cards on my DHCP relay agent,\n\n242\n00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.870\nlet's think of it this way.\n\n243\n00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.913\nThe inside network Is going to\nbe the information in pink,\n\n244\n00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:32.397\nso that'll be our 192 network.\n\n245\n00:13:32.397 --> 00:13:35.459\nSo on the exam, obviously,\nthey're not gonna color code it and\n\n246\n00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:39.800\nmake it that easy for you, but I just\nwant you to think in this direction here.\n\n247\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.705\nAnd on my network interface card\nthat I've labeled as outside,\n\n248\n00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:47.995\nthat is going to be this yellow\nnetwork here, so my 10 dot network.\n\n249\n00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:53.285\nSo this DHCP relay agent\nis acting as a bridge, it's\n\n250\n00:13:53.285 --> 00:13:57.415\nkinda straddling both of these networks,\nand it allows that communication.\n\n251\n00:13:57.415 --> 00:14:01.929\nSo I have both the inside and\nthe outside facing network interface card,\n\n252\n00:14:01.929 --> 00:14:05.714\nthose interfaces,\nto allow that communication to happen.\n\n253\n00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:12.010\nAll right, so SVR02 is gonna be the server\nthat's acting as my DHCP relay agent.\n\n254\n00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.850\nAnd then SVR01 is going to\nbe behind my head here,\n\n255\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.090\nthat's going to be our DHCP server.\n\n256\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.330\nAnd this is the IP address that\nwe'll need to keep in mind,\n\n257\n00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.250\nbecause we do need to go ahead and\nset that as well.\n\n258\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.250\nSo let's go ahead and hop on into SVRO2,\n\n259\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:33.390\nthe first thing that I need to do\nwithin this machine is to go ahead and\n\n260\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.840\ninstall the routing and\nremote access features, so RRAS.\n\n261\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.950\nSo let's go ahead and just click our\nAdd Roles and Features wizard, and\n\n262\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.970\nwe'll skip this default page,\nwe'll hit Next.\n\n263\n00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.070\nAnd this is going to be a role based or\nfeature based installation, so\n\n264\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.240\nwe'll hit Next again, and this is\nthe correct server, so we'll hit Next.\n\n265\n00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.670\nNow when I'm looking for my particular\nrole here I'm actually going to be\n\n266\n00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:04.480\ninstalling the remote access role,\nso you see that right there.\n\n267\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.280\nThe routing part will come here\nin a moment, this first option,\n\n268\n00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.650\nlet me zoom out so we can kind\nof look at the description here.\n\n269\n00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.380\nThere are a lot of different\nconfigurations that you can use with\n\n270\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.170\nremote access.\n\n271\n00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.759\nSo remote access provides seamless\nconnectivity through direct access.\n\n272\n00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:24.188\nAnd direct access is a feature that\nallows a remote user to access\n\n273\n00:15:24.188 --> 00:15:29.000\nnetwork resources without setting up and\ngoing through a VPN.\n\n274\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.480\nYou can also use VPN,\nyou can use it as a web application proxy.\n\n275\n00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.672\nYou could use it for network access\nprotection, and network access policy.\n\n276\n00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:42.552\nSo there's a lot of different\nconfigurations that you can use with this\n\n277\n00:15:42.552 --> 00:15:43.875\none particular role.\n\n278\n00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:46.825\nWe'll hit Next and then go from there and\nsee what we need to do.\n\n279\n00:15:46.825 --> 00:15:51.008\nAll right, we'll just hit Next again,\nthere are some components that need to be\n\n280\n00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:53.836\ninstalled as well here And\nwe'll see how that kind of,\n\n281\n00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:58.018\nthe operating system here in the Wizard\nwill help walk you through that process to\n\n282\n00:15:58.018 --> 00:16:01.760\nmake sure you have everything\ninstalled that needs to be.\n\n283\n00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.070\nNow, when I go to select routing,\n\n284\n00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:10.420\nyou'll notice here the different\ndependencies that I also have to install.\n\n285\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.930\nAnd I will have to go ahead and\ninstall IIS as well.\n\n286\n00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.830\nThat's gonna be a subfeature so\n\n287\n00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.550\nwe'll just hit Add Feature so\nthat there's quite a few here.\n\n288\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.090\nAnd you'll even notice when I\ngo back to the second screen,\n\n289\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.294\nI didn't check this tick box, but\n\n290\n00:16:24.294 --> 00:16:28.750\nDirectAccess was automatically\nenabled because there are components\n\n291\n00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.720\nwith this setting that are utilized\nin the configuration for DHCP relay.\n\n292\n00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.400\nAll right, we'll hit Next.\n\n293\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.970\nAnd then just information to note.\n\n294\n00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.592\nLetting you know about some of those\nunderpinning technologies as well here\n\n295\n00:16:44.592 --> 00:16:45.175\nfor IIS.\n\n296\n00:16:45.175 --> 00:16:48.930\nWe'll hit Next and then Install.\n\n297\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.770\nThis should take a few minutes,\nnot anything major here,\n\n298\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:57.570\nbut just as we're going through this\ninstallation, just waiting for that.\n\n299\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.075\nIt's really not a difficult role to go\nahead and install, but there will be some\n\n300\n00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:05.300\npost-configuration activities that we need\nto perform as soon as we get this role in.\n\n301\n00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.309\nBut I think for right now,\nwe'll just go ahead and pause so\n\n302\n00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:08.383\nyou don't have to watch this.\n\n303\n00:17:08.383 --> 00:17:12.192\nAll right, so\nnow that the role as been installed,\n\n304\n00:17:12.192 --> 00:17:14.950\nwe have some post- configuration.\n\n305\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:20.030\nAs a matter of fact, if we just hit\nclose here, we can be alerted to that.\n\n306\n00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.660\nThere's a Wizard where you can\ngo ahead and configure it for\n\n307\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.500\nsome basic configurations that pop\nup here, but for our situation,\n\n308\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.920\nwe're gonna go about this a little bit,\na different approach.\n\n309\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.830\nSo a couple different ways you\ncould go ahead you configure.\n\n310\n00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.630\nWe'll just cancel out of that for\nright now.\n\n311\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:43.839\nYou could pull up an MMC, so I'm just\ngoing to open a Run command here and,\n\n312\n00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:46.878\na Run line and type in MMC and\nand hit Enter.\n\n313\n00:17:46.878 --> 00:17:49.670\nLet me just get this out of the way.\n\n314\n00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.978\nThe snap-ins that I would be adding,\n\n315\n00:17:51.978 --> 00:17:56.490\nso we would go to Add/Remove snap-in\nhere to create our custom MMC.\n\n316\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.390\nThis is going to be Routing and\nRemote Access if I can find that.\n\n317\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.560\nGimme one second.\n\n318\n00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.068\nOkay, Routing and\nRemote Access, there it is.\n\n319\n00:18:10.068 --> 00:18:15.486\nAnd so you can go ahead and select OK and\nthen you would need to add a server and\n\n320\n00:18:15.486 --> 00:18:21.434\nat this point, which is really easy, you\njust right click and select Add Server.\n\n321\n00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:26.683\nBut alternatively, we could also use\njust the drop down under our tools and\n\n322\n00:18:26.683 --> 00:18:32.350\nnow that that role has been installed,\nwe can pull up routing and route access.\n\n323\n00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.101\nThe server's already in there.\n\n324\n00:18:33.101 --> 00:18:38.667\nYou can see it needs to be configured and\nenabled though so.\n\n325\n00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:44.980\nWith that little red arrow, you can see\nit, but I didn't have to add it in.\n\n326\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.190\nSo just a couple different ways that you\ncould access that and use these tools.\n\n327\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.690\nAll right.\n\n328\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.910\nSo what we need to do here.\n\n329\n00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.450\nLet's go ahead and right click and\nselect Configure and\n\n330\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.670\nEnable Routing and Remote Access.\n\n331\n00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.790\nSo this'll walk us\nthrough our Wizard here.\n\n332\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.760\nNow like I said,\n\n333\n00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.410\nthere are a lot of different ways\nthat we can utilize this role.\n\n334\n00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.580\nFor our situation,\n\n335\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.540\nwe're gonna select this last radio\nbutton which is Custom Configurations.\n\n336\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.960\nSo we wanna make sure we hit that.\n\n337\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.480\nAnd then, Next.\n\n338\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.710\nAnd again, we have several\ndifferent options of how we could\n\n339\n00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:20.620\nconfigure this here.\n\n340\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.890\nBut we're gonna be setting this up for\nLAN routing.\n\n341\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.265\nSo if we think about our diagram,\n\n342\n00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:29.705\ntechnically we have two\ndifferent local area networks.\n\n343\n00:19:29.705 --> 00:19:34.599\nBut we could be using this on one local\narea network with two different subnets,\n\n344\n00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:37.317\nso let's just go ahead and\nhit Finish here.\n\n345\n00:19:37.317 --> 00:19:40.402\nAll right, and we'll also need to\ngo ahead and start this service.\n\n346\n00:19:40.402 --> 00:19:43.000\nThat's something that'll\njust take a second here.\n\n347\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.310\nThe next thing we need to\ndo is add an interface.\n\n348\n00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:52.140\nSo if you think about the way that DORA\nprocess works, when the client is calling\n\n349\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.230\nout to that DHCP server,\nremember how we had a pink and\n\n350\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:01.100\na yellow interfaced, we had two\ndifferent interfaces on our DHCP relay.\n\n351\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.700\nSo we have that, inside was the pink and\noutside was yellow.\n\n352\n00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:10.720\nSo what network interface would you\nexpect incoming DHCP requests to come on?\n\n353\n00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.374\nWell, if the client was on\nthe inside the pink network,\n\n354\n00:20:13.374 --> 00:20:16.103\nthey're sending that\ncommunication to the DHCP relay.\n\n355\n00:20:16.103 --> 00:20:20.027\nThat inside network,\nthat was going to be our 192 network,\n\n356\n00:20:20.027 --> 00:20:24.910\nthat's where we need to set that\ninterface for those incoming requests.\n\n357\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.330\nSo that's what we wanna do right now.\n\n358\n00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:31.800\nSo on top of IPv4, make sure you\nleft click it and then right click.\n\n359\n00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.120\nLet's see here.\n\n360\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.610\nThat is just going to be under,\none more thing I forgot to do first.\n\n361\n00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:43.350\nWe do need to go ahead, and expand out,\nand create that actual protocol.\n\n362\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.759\nSo expand out IPv4.\n\n363\n00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:48.660\nThat's all I did right here was just\nclick that little arrow or caret.\n\n364\n00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.635\nSo on our General option underneath IPv4,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n365\n00:20:52.635 --> 00:20:55.944\nright click and\nthen specify New Routing Protocol.\n\n366\n00:20:55.944 --> 00:21:02.750\nWe wanna ensure that we have\nDHCP Relay Agent selected here.\n\n367\n00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.630\nThis is the routing protocol\nwe'll be adding and we'll hit OK.\n\n368\n00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.230\nNow note over on the left hand pane,\nmy DHCP Relay Agent option appeared,\n\n369\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.650\nso let's left click on that and\nthen right click and select New Interface.\n\n370\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.710\nNow from the Options, you can see\nthe Interfaces that this machine,\n\n371\n00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.780\nthe server currently has enabled, and\n\n372\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.630\nif you think back to the diagram\nthat we had spoke about before,\n\n373\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:34.600\nthe inside interface, that pink interface\nis what we're gonna be selecting here.\n\n374\n00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:40.080\nAnd just thinking about that logic, with\nthe client calling out trying to connect\n\n375\n00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:46.330\nto the DHCP server, and the other, the ten\ndot network, this is the listening or\n\n376\n00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.150\nthe interface that would be\nreceiving those DHCP packets.\n\n377\n00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.320\nSo that's what we wanna\nmake sure is selected here.\n\n378\n00:21:54.448 --> 00:21:59.254\nWe'll hit OK and\nif we take a look at this option,\n\n379\n00:21:59.254 --> 00:22:05.603\nyou always wanna make sure that\nthe DHCP packets box is enabled.\n\n380\n00:22:05.603 --> 00:22:08.127\nI mean, that's what we're\nreally working with here, so\n\n381\n00:22:08.127 --> 00:22:10.530\nwe need to make sure\nthat that is selected.\n\n382\n00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.822\nAnd then we also have the ability to\nincrease or decrease our hop-counts.\n\n383\n00:22:14.822 --> 00:22:18.200\nSo hop-counts, if you recall\nback when you were learning or\n\n384\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.930\neven working with routing,\nwhen we're traversing either interface,\n\n385\n00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.420\nrouter, those are considered\nour hops there.\n\n386\n00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.300\nSo depending on the topology of your\nnetwork, you may want to increase or\n\n387\n00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:33.940\ndecrease depending on how many hops that\npacket will need to go through before it\n\n388\n00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.840\neventually reaches that DHCP server.\n\n389\n00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.220\nAs well as our boot threshold\nlisted here in seconds, but\n\n390\n00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.566\nI'm just going to keep the defaults.\n\n391\n00:22:41.566 --> 00:22:44.160\nAnd we'll hit OK.\n\n392\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.000\nAnd the next thing you need to\ndo is specify the IP address\n\n393\n00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.510\nof the DHCP server/servers that\nyou're trying to communicate with.\n\n394\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:57.130\nSo let's right click on top of DHCP\nRelay Agent, and then go to Properties.\n\n395\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:02.600\nIn this diagram,\nI only have one DHCP server running and\n\n396\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.900\noffering that service, so\nlet's go ahead and put that IP address in.\n\n397\n00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.477\nThat is going to be 10.1.0.10.\n\n398\n00:23:07.477 --> 00:23:09.895\nWe'll make sure we hit Add, so\n\n399\n00:23:09.895 --> 00:23:15.300\nit moves down to the second portion\nright here and then we'll hit OK.\n\n400\n00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.700\nAnd really that's it, Ronnie.\n\n401\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.690\nI mean, it's not too difficult\nto go ahead and set up.\n\n402\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:26.120\nBut let's hop on over to our client to\njust verify that we can obtain the correct\n\n403\n00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.630\nIP address from the scope,\nthe 192 scope there, so.\n\n404\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.240\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n405\n00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.590\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n406\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.110\nLet's go over to our\nWindows 10 Client here, and\n\n407\n00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.570\nI'll just pull up a Command prompt.\n\n408\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.360\nAnd let's see what we've\ngot here currently.\n\n409\n00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.058\nAll right, so It's already got a 192,\nand we can even do a release and a renew\n\n410\n00:23:51.058 --> 00:23:57.410\nwith IP configure to verify that this is,\nin fact, getting the proper IP address.\n\n411\n00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.755\nBut let me just zoom in so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n412\n00:23:59.755 --> 00:24:02.660\nThis is 192.168.43.128, and\n\n413\n00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.800\nthat is within the specified\nscope that we were looking for.\n\n414\n00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.810\nNow, what we really don't wanna see\nin this situation obviously would be\n\n415\n00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.730\nthat good old APIPA address because\nthen we would know something with our\n\n416\n00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.490\nconfiguration didn't go according to plan,\nand that we need to kind of retrace steps.\n\n417\n00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.360\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, look, let's verify this.\n\n418\n00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.930\nLet's do an IP config on,\nthat way we get this stamp.\n\n419\n00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:23.579\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n420\n00:24:23.579 --> 00:24:25.837\nthen that way when we\nactually do the release and\n\n421\n00:24:25.837 --> 00:24:28.020\nrenew we'll actually see it come in for\nus.\n\n422\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.120\n&gt;&gt; With the timestamp?\n\n423\n00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n424\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.800\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlet's make that a little bit bigger here.\n\n425\n00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.350\n&gt;&gt; So if you'll scroll up towards the top.\n\n426\n00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.948\n&gt;&gt; I see.\n\n427\n00:24:38.948 --> 00:24:39.935\n&gt;&gt; Little bit, there you go.\n\n428\n00:24:39.935 --> 00:24:40.640\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n429\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.735\n&gt;&gt; August, there it is,\nTuesday August 15th, and there you go and\n\n430\n00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:47.680\nthere's your sticker note and time.\n\n431\n00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.518\n&gt;&gt; So you know it's fresh and\nnew and it's not [INAUDIBLE].\n\n432\n00:24:49.518 --> 00:24:51.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's try it again.\n\n433\n00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And see what happens.\n\n434\n00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.580\nOkay, so at this point right?\n\n435\n00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.320\nWhat Cherokee's actually gonna do for\nus is just an IP config release and renew,\n\n436\n00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.920\nand that will disconnect her\nfrom the DHCP server and\n\n437\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.675\nmanually start the DORA process over\nagain, or at least we think it will.\n\n438\n00:25:06.675 --> 00:25:08.362\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the goal here.\n\n439\n00:25:08.362 --> 00:25:09.012\n&gt;&gt; So here we go yeah.\n\n440\n00:25:09.012 --> 00:25:09.671\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n441\n00:25:09.671 --> 00:25:10.894\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee.\n\n442\n00:25:10.894 --> 00:25:12.051\n&gt;&gt; What did I say?\n\n443\n00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:13.984\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, did you use-\n&gt;&gt; ipconfig /renew,\n\n444\n00:25:13.984 --> 00:25:15.538\nlet's go to second here.\n\n445\n00:25:15.538 --> 00:25:22.127\nLet's specify network NBC block is in use.\n\n446\n00:25:22.127 --> 00:25:23.325\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n447\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.423\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n448\n00:25:29.771 --> 00:25:31.020\nThere we go.\n\n449\n00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.297\nI think you were faster\nthan the actual computer.\n\n450\n00:25:33.297 --> 00:25:35.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI have to give it a second there, but-\n\n451\n00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.857\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n452\n00:25:35.857 --> 00:25:37.892\n&gt;&gt; But we can see the IP address, and\n\n453\n00:25:37.892 --> 00:25:42.280\nif I were to do the space forward\nslash all again, oops it's not renew.\n\n454\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.901\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] That way we get the timestamp and\n\n455\n00:25:45.901 --> 00:25:47.416\nshould update.\n\n456\n00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:48.290\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And there goes yup,\n\n457\n00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.690\nit updated about a few minutes later,\nis what we see.\n\n458\n00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.090\nJust a couple of minutes later.\n\n459\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.630\nSo we see it's actually\nworking in real time.\n\n460\n00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.866\nAnd this is an important concept when you\ndo have those multiple sub-nests, but\n\n461\n00:25:58.866 --> 00:26:02.790\nyou only have a single DHCP server,\nand it's got to be able to reply to\n\n462\n00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.600\nall of those different DHCP\nrequests that are out there.\n\n463\n00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.870\nSo it's a handy technology to understand,\nand\n\n464\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.480\nit is something that you'll\nsee tested on the exam.\n\n465\n00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.240\nSo it's something that you definitely\nneed to at least experience, and\n\n466\n00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.900\nget into labs, and\nbe able to set up for us too.\n\n467\n00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.218\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nI think that's about it, Ronnie.\n\n468\n00:26:20.218 --> 00:26:22.520\nThat's the end of our DHCP journey.\n\n469\n00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.355\nIt's been a long one.\n\n470\n00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:26.101\nHopefully, you guys have enjoyed it,\nbut we do have some more information in\n\n471\n00:26:26.101 --> 00:26:28.790\nthe upcoming shows that\nyou don't want to miss.\n\n472\n00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee thank you again for\nhelping us to understand a few more of\n\n473\n00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.630\nthe ideas of the options that\nwe have to deal with, and\n\n474\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.100\nof course even setting up\nthe idea of the DHCP real agent.\n\n475\n00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.910\nThese are all important concepts\nthat you'll see tested, so\n\n476\n00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.360\ndo not just go,\nhey I'm not gonna worry about this.\n\n477\n00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.540\nYou'll be surprised that DHCP is one of\nthose core technologies that you need to\n\n478\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.850\nlearn about for Windows Server 2012.\n\n479\n00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:54.190\nWell there's more to come on the course\nexam 70-410, but that ends it for\n\n480\n00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.560\nthis episode.\n\n481\n00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.600\nSigning off for ItProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n482\n00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boost.\n\n483\n00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.875\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the exam 70-410 shows.\n\n484\n00:27:03.875 --> 00:27:11.679\n[MUSIC].\n\n485\n00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:14.523\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.894\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to your 70-410 series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.680\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.030\nIn this episode we'll be taking\na look at how to install DNS.\n\n7\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.810\nOne of our core network services.\n\n8\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.370\nAnd back with us today in the studios\nwe have Mr Mike Rodrick, thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.530\njoining us Mike how is it going?\n\n10\n00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.810\n&gt;&gt; It's going fantastic\nCherokee glad to back and\n\n11\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.970\nglad to be here on our great topic too.\n\n12\n00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.210\n&gt;&gt; I know you are like on a roll\nhere with some really good topics.\n\n13\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.120\n&gt;&gt; We are yes you do all my favorites\nthey invite me here to do that.\n\n14\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.440\nThe active directory and\nnow to do the DNS.\n\n15\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.162\nHopefully I'll get OUs and group policy.\n\n16\n00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:46.859\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And just round out my week, I love it.\n\n17\n00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.510\nAll right so yes we are going\nto be talking about DNS today or\n\n18\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.040\ndomain name service or domain name\nsystem depending on who you talk to.\n\n19\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.870\nAnd it is, it truly is one of my\nfavorites because it's again one\n\n20\n00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.560\nof those core services that\nreally everything else relies on,\n\n21\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.985\nwhen you talk about all these other\nservices that people get excited about.\n\n22\n00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:12.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exchange and SQL and SharePoint or\n\n23\n00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.660\nall of that stuff.\n\n24\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.915\n&gt;&gt; Things we can do without perhaps.\n\n25\n00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:17.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah things we can do without,\n\n26\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.000\nthings we are always working\non ends up relying on DNS.\n\n27\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.790\nAlright, I mean, everything we do from\nchecking your email to buying products at\n\n28\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.490\nyour favorite online retailer-\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n\n29\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.280\n&gt;&gt; To logging in [LAUGH] to your computer\nat work to connecting to a file share,\n\n30\n00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.900\nI mean, everything relies on DNS.\n\n31\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.440\nAnd so it's a very important service\nto make sure that we have running,\n\n32\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.710\nand to make sure it's performing well and\nit's fun.\n\n33\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.540\nI think that's probably why I like it.\n\n34\n00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.550\nAnd its been around for\na long time and its not new, and\n\n35\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.730\nits not a Microsoft thing.\n\n36\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.560\nMicrosoft calls their service DNS Service,\nbut DNS is a,\n\n37\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.845\ndomain name services is a-\n&gt;&gt; Universally accepted it's just,\n\n38\n00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:01.613\nit's out there.\n\n39\n00:02:01.613 --> 00:02:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft has a habit of doing that,\nyou like to brand their stuff with\n\n40\n00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.610\nsome of the key terms like the,\nSQL is not a Microsoft thing,\n\n41\n00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.080\nit's structured query language, but\nthey have their SQL server which is here.\n\n42\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.950\nSo just so we understand, there\nare other choices, like we have Bind.\n\n43\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.360\nGosh now I can't remember,\nBerkeley internet name daemon.\n\n44\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.540\nYeah, so blanked there for a second.\n\n45\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.660\nYou know, for another-\n&gt;&gt; For\n\n46\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.930\nthe Nicks base system's\nan alternative to DNS.\n\n47\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n48\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not an alternative to DNS.\n\n49\n00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.040\nIt is DNS.\n\n50\n00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.440\nIt's just a different\nimplementation style.\n\n51\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.540\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Not Microsoft.\n\n52\n00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.820\n&gt;&gt; And it's probably more common on the\nweb than Microsoft, honestly, you know,\n\n53\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.370\nbecause a lot of our internet services\nare using Linux and they're running fine.\n\n54\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.690\nBut in corporate environments where we're\nrunning a Microsoft world, very, very,\n\n55\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.580\ncommon to be using DNS\nthat comes with Microsoft.\n\n56\n00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.790\nBecause it's a role that gets\ninstalled free, and it works.\n\n57\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.250\nThat's what we're here\nto talk about today.\n\n58\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.620\nSo we're gonna start just\nby getting it installed.\n\n59\n00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.970\nI'm gonna kind of switch things up.\n\n60\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.050\nNormally I would talk all about DNS and\ngive you all this back ground and\n\n61\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.090\nbreak everything down for you and\nthen we take a look at it.\n\n62\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.330\nWe're gonna try something\na little different today.\n\n63\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.145\n&gt;&gt; Shaking it up.\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n64\n00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:17.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna live on the edge here and\n\n65\n00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.750\nwe're gonna get it installed so\nthat we can see what we have and\n\n66\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.930\nthen talk about it, cuz I think sometimes\nwith DNS that might be a little easier\n\n67\n00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.260\nthan talking about zones and caching and\nforwarding and all those other stuff.\n\n68\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.890\nWithout really even seeing DNS, which\nsome of you might not have seen DNS yet.\n\n69\n00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.510\nSo that's what we're going to do.\n\n70\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.210\nSo let's talk about, first and foremost,\nlet's do some basic terminology though.\n\n71\n00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.010\nWe do need to understand what it is and\nwhy we're doing it, right?\n\n72\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.620\nSo DNS is a name resolution service.\n\n73\n00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.550\nIt resolves, for the most part,\nnames into IP addresses.\n\n74\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.470\nNow when I say names,\n\n75\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.320\nwe do want to make sure we're clear\nit's fully qualified domain names.\n\n76\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.980\nAnd remember what that is, hopefully\nwe remember this from Network Plus,\n\n77\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.580\nwhen we talk about a computer,\nthe computer has a name,\n\n78\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.125\nlike my computer's name is I wanna\ntell you what my laptop's name is?\n\n79\n00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:13.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; See?\n\n80\n00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.000\n&gt;&gt; It's Dagobah, so if you're a Star Wars\nfan, you'll know where I'm coming from.\n\n81\n00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.480\nOtherwise, you're going, what a geek.\n\n82\n00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.530\nBut my computer's name is Dagobah,\nso it has a name.\n\n83\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.360\nBut that's not it's full name.\n\n84\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.420\nIf it belongs to a domain,\nlike here we have ITPro.TV.\n\n85\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.690\nAnd so when my computer's part of that\ndomain I have Dagobah as its hostname,\n\n86\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.650\nand then I have the .itpro.tv\nas its DNS suffix.\n\n87\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.510\nAnd when we plug those two together,\nwe get what's called the FQDN, or\n\n88\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.710\nfully qualified domain name, right?\n\n89\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.270\nYou can almost think of it\nlike first name and last name.\n\n90\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.250\nLike we do in humans.\n\n91\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.164\nYou have Dagobah would be his first name.\n\n92\n00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:02.110\n.ITpro.itv would be its\nlast name if you will.\n\n93\n00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.740\nAnd I like that analogy because\nall of the computers in my domain\n\n94\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.766\nshare the same last name.\n\n95\n00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:11.930\nJust like all the people in my\nhousehold share the same last name, but\n\n96\n00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.510\nwe each have a unique first name\nto differentiate between us.\n\n97\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.540\nAnd computers typically have to\nhave a unique name on the network.\n\n98\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.280\nAnd then we plug those together.\n\n99\n00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.000\nMy first name is Mike.\n\n100\n00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000\nBut my full name is,\ndo I say that on camera?\n\n101\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.960\nMichael Darren Rodrick.\n\n102\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.430\nThat's my fully qualified human name,\nif you will.\n\n103\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's so funny I was just thinking\nabout that I'm like okay so how does that\n\n104\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.410\nmiddle name come into play here because\nsome people don't have middle names and\n\n105\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.520\nthey're optional just like if you were to\nhave a sub domain which is optional right?\n\n106\n00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.820\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; You could definitely that as\n\n107\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.660\nan analogy I like that.\n\n108\n00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah except for\n\n109\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.040\nthe middle names in the middle-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.700\nIt's close.\n\n111\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.960\n&gt;&gt; Close enough yeah.\n\n112\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.060\n&gt;&gt; To get back to where we went we're\nsaying that when we resolve names DNS\n\n113\n00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.010\ntakes a name and\nturns it into an IP address.\n\n114\n00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.930\nAnd a fully qualified domain name not just\na name, a fully qualified domain name.\n\n115\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.100\nWe do this because as humans we\ncan remember names very easily or\n\n116\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.250\nmost of us maybe me not so much.\n\n117\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.500\nBut it's easy for us to remember names.\n\n118\n00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.916\nI know If I wanted-\n&gt;&gt; CNN.com, or\n\n119\n00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:14.969\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n120\n00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:17.920\nif I wanted to go to computer parts,\nI go to Newegg.com.\n\n121\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.160\nIf I want to go shopping,\nI go to Amazon.com.\n\n122\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.020\nIf I wanna go check my phone bill,\nI got to ATT.com, right?\n\n123\n00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.075\n&gt;&gt; You mean you don't have all\nthose IP addresses memorized?\n\n124\n00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:28.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, but\n\n125\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.060\nwhat if we couldn't do that?\n\n126\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.018\nWhat if we had to use IP addresses?\n\n127\n00:06:32.018 --> 00:06:37.471\nAnd I had to remember that\nnew egg is 12.14.210.157.\n\n128\n00:06:37.471 --> 00:06:38.864\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; No I'm just making that up.\n\n129\n00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:39.796\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n130\n00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:41.297\n&gt;&gt; That's not the actual IP address, but\n\n131\n00:06:41.297 --> 00:06:43.100\nit's just like with your phone.\n\n132\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.227\nHow many, I can't tell you what\nmy father's phone number is.\n\n133\n00:06:45.227 --> 00:06:47.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I go into my contacts.\n\n134\n00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:51.495\nI can look his name up and I hit it and\nmy phone knows the phone number\n\n135\n00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:53.595\nthat's associated with that name and\nit can call it.\n\n136\n00:06:53.595 --> 00:06:55.995\nSo I don't have to remember\nall these phone numbers.\n\n137\n00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:58.965\nI have names that are then\nmapped to phone numbers.\n\n138\n00:06:58.965 --> 00:07:01.135\nIt's the same thing with DNS.\n\n139\n00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:04.295\nInstead of me having to remember\nthe IP address of every machine I\n\n140\n00:07:04.295 --> 00:07:05.700\nneed to connect to.\n\n141\n00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.480\nI just remember their names, and then I\ncan type in their name in my application\n\n142\n00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.430\nwhatever that is, a file share,\nlike file explorer, or a command prompt\n\n143\n00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.730\ntrying to pin something, or a browser\ntrying to connect to some website.\n\n144\n00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:24.520\nI can type in a human readable name, and\nthen what happens is my computer says,\n\n145\n00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.680\nI can't connect to this, because computers\ncan only connect to IP addresses.\n\n146\n00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.190\nWhen we talk about a socket\nbetween two machines,\n\n147\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.420\na connection between two computers.\n\n148\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.850\nThere's three parts involved,\nthere's the protocol, the IP address and\n\n149\n00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.310\nthe Port number.\n\n150\n00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.250\nNo where in there does it say name right,\ncomputers can't connect to names.\n\n151\n00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.550\nSo whether we type in\nnames in an application or\n\n152\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.430\nwhatever it is, somewhere that name has\nto be converted into an IP address so\n\n153\n00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.460\nthat my computer can then reach out and\ntry to make that connection.\n\n154\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.540\nAnd that's what DNS does when I type\nin www.newegg.com in my browser.\n\n155\n00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.807\nMy computer goes through a process\nof creating and sending queries or\n\n156\n00:08:02.807 --> 00:08:04.509\nquestions To DNS servers.\n\n157\n00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:08.189\nAnd those DNS look up their\ninformation in their database,\n\n158\n00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:13.890\nwhich we're gonna call a zone file in\na minute, and they say, there's the name.\n\n159\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.526\nHere's the IP address,\nthis is what you want.\n\n160\n00:08:15.526 --> 00:08:19.123\nAnd they hand me back the IP address\nwith the response to the query,\n\n161\n00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:23.060\nthen my computer can establish that\nconnection to that IP address.\n\n162\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.937\nSo without DNS,\n\n163\n00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:28.149\nwe would have to know the IP address of\neverything we need to connect to, right?\n\n164\n00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:32.575\nAnd that's really not feasible, and\nit also helps with changes, too.\n\n165\n00:08:32.575 --> 00:08:37.632\nTake Newegg.com, for example,\nthey've got dozens of web servers.\n\n166\n00:08:37.632 --> 00:08:39.526\nWhat of if one of their\nweb servers goes down and\n\n167\n00:08:39.526 --> 00:08:42.208\nthe IP address that I happen to\nremember is not longer available?\n\n168\n00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:45.254\nThe machine was retired,\nthey swap subnets.\n\n169\n00:08:45.254 --> 00:08:47.518\nWho knows what's happening on their end?\n\n170\n00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:51.033\nNow all of a sudden they've gotta tell the\nentire world what the new address is for\n\n171\n00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:51.768\ntheir webpage.\n\n172\n00:08:51.768 --> 00:08:55.506\nThat's not gonna be very efficient,\nbut since we all just go to the name,\n\n173\n00:08:55.506 --> 00:08:58.980\nthe IP address behind it just to\nhas to be updated in the database.\n\n174\n00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.043\nWe still go to Newegg.com whether\nthe IP address is changed or not.\n\n175\n00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.700\nWe just have to remember Newegg.com.\n\n176\n00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.290\nAnd DNS can be aware of the changed IP\naddress, so it makes things like that\n\n177\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.598\na whole lot easier round-robining,\nload balancing, all of that.\n\n178\n00:09:13.598 --> 00:09:17.632\n&gt;&gt; The back-end management activities\nare gonna be concealed and hidden so\n\n179\n00:09:17.632 --> 00:09:20.630\nthat the end user has that\nseamless experience there.\n\n180\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.441\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\nthat's the wonderful thing about DNS.\n\n181\n00:09:24.441 --> 00:09:27.647\nAll right so, we'll talk a little bit\nmore about it as we go through here,\n\n182\n00:09:27.647 --> 00:09:29.739\nbecause it does a lot more than that,\nas I said.\n\n183\n00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:33.221\nI described, well,\nlet's not jump ahead, I get excited.\n\n184\n00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:36.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, you said we were\ngonna start with our demo first so-\n\n185\n00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are.\n\n186\n00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.166\nSo we are gonna install DNS,\nand we're done, woo hoo!\n\n187\n00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:41.720\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n188\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.734\n&gt;&gt; Did you watch the other episode\nwhere we did Active Directory?\n\n189\n00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:46.050\nYeah, that's where we installed DNS.\n\n190\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.790\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n191\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.420\nWe are gonna install DNS.\n\n192\n00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.156\nBut we wanna make sure we understand that\nthere's really a couple of ways we can\n\n193\n00:09:53.156 --> 00:09:54.030\ninstall DNS.\n\n194\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.240\nOne is through Server Manager.\n\n195\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.880\nWe can add it like a role,\nlike any other role.\n\n196\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.890\nYou've seen us do that in other episodes\nand other shows in our library, so\n\n197\n00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.150\nthat's nothing new to you.\n\n198\n00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.158\nWe can go into the wizard,\nchoose DNS, and install it,\n\n199\n00:10:06.158 --> 00:10:08.666\nand we're gonna do that\nhere in just a second.\n\n200\n00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:12.530\nIn fact, let's do it right now\nsince they've got the screen up.\n\n201\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.120\nThis is server one, and\nit's just a member server in my domain.\n\n202\n00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.232\nSo let's go to local server here for\na second.\n\n203\n00:10:19.232 --> 00:10:23.501\nThere's his name, and\nyou can see he's part of my domain.\n\n204\n00:10:23.501 --> 00:10:28.440\nHe's got a static IP address,\nnothing fancy about the server, and\n\n205\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.995\nthen we are going to add rules and\nfeatures.\n\n206\n00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:36.440\nLaunches our handy dandy wizard,\nwhere we'll click Next three times.\n\n207\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.780\nI don't about you,\nI always get these pages really fast.\n\n208\n00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.420\nThe first one is just telling you,\nhey, to install roles,\n\n209\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.510\nyou've got to be an administrator.\n\n210\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, they've already seen it a few\ntimes, you guys know what it is, and so-\n\n211\n00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:46.864\n&gt;&gt; And if you haven't,\n\n212\n00:10:46.864 --> 00:10:47.665\nslow down, and read it.\n\n213\n00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:49.670\nThere's some good information there,\nright?\n\n214\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.920\nAnd then is this role-based or\nremote desktop services?\n\n215\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.650\nWell, we're not doing VDI or\nterminal services, so\n\n216\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.850\nit's almost always gonna be role-based,\nunless we have that specific need.\n\n217\n00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.920\nAnd then because I'm on this server,\nthe server's already selected,\n\n218\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.380\nso I just skip right by that.\n\n219\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.780\nThen you get to the important screen\nwhere we get our server roles,\n\n220\n00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.990\nDNS being one of them.\n\n221\n00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.390\nSo I'm going to simply click DNS.\n\n222\n00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:18.560\nI will include the management tools,\nand then we'll click Next.\n\n223\n00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.670\nI don't need any additional features.\n\n224\n00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.784\nIt gives me some information about DNS.\n\n225\n00:11:22.784 --> 00:11:26.980\nWe'll click Next, and\nthen we will click Install.\n\n226\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.480\nAnd that will begin\nthe installation process.\n\n227\n00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.740\nNow while that's rolling,\nlet's flip over to our domain controller.\n\n228\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.140\nSo in another episode,\nwe installed Active Directory.\n\n229\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.630\nAnd if you remember or\n\n230\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.120\nif you haven't seen it yet, look for\nthis when you watch that episode.\n\n231\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.510\nThere's a check mark on the second or\n\n232\n00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.320\nthird page there that talked\nabout installing DNS.\n\n233\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.586\nAnd I've mentioned it before,\nActive Directory and DNS are tightly,\n\n234\n00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:52.629\ntightly integrated.\n\n235\n00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.590\nActive directory requires DNS.\n\n236\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.643\nIt can't function without it.\n\n237\n00:11:56.643 --> 00:12:02.420\nSo when you install Active Directory, we\nalmost always install DNS along with it.\n\n238\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.298\nSo my domain controller here-\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\n\n239\n00:12:04.298 --> 00:12:06.283\nit just really make sense if\nyou think about it there.\n\n240\n00:12:06.283 --> 00:12:08.162\nI mean, you're talking about\ntwo different databases.\n\n241\n00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:11.537\nSo why have extra work when\nyou can combine the two and\n\n242\n00:12:11.537 --> 00:12:14.600\njust have them aggregated together there?\n\n243\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.536\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly and\n\n244\n00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:19.697\nwe're gonna talk about that cuz there's a\nkey point that you kind of threw in there.\n\n245\n00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:20.579\nBut I don't know if everybody's\nkind of aware of that.\n\n246\n00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:21.109\n&gt;&gt; Ready for it?\n\n247\n00:12:21.109 --> 00:12:22.368\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n248\n00:12:22.368 --> 00:12:26.191\n&gt;&gt; About that combining of the databases,\ncuz that's something that you don't have\n\n249\n00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:28.660\nto do, but\nwe will definitely wanna talk about that.\n\n250\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.880\nSo keep that thought in mind.\n\n251\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.180\nSo there you can see DNS is\ninstalled on this machine,\n\n252\n00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.430\nbecause I installed it when I\ninstalled Active Directory.\n\n253\n00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.730\nAnd I think to your point, Cherokee,\nActive Directory requires DNS.\n\n254\n00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.470\nSo if it's on the same machine\nas the domain controller,\n\n255\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.540\nyou can almost guarantee that DNS will\nalways be available for Active Directory.\n\n256\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.590\nThe server is up, and as long as\nboth services start successfully,\n\n257\n00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.956\nActive Directory should\nalways have access to DNS.\n\n258\n00:12:54.956 --> 00:12:55.810\nAnd that's a good thing, right?\n\n259\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.151\nThat's what we want,\nbut you don't have to.\n\n260\n00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:03.264\nIf some of you are a little older school,\nwe might remember running a lot of DNS\n\n261\n00:13:03.264 --> 00:13:06.460\nservers that weren't\non domain controllers.\n\n262\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.866\nThat was just the way things were done\nprior to Active Directory-integrated\n\n263\n00:13:10.866 --> 00:13:14.946\nzones, which is the term we're gonna\ntalk about here in just a minute.\n\n264\n00:13:14.946 --> 00:13:18.672\nAll right, so\nlet's flip back over to server one,\n\n265\n00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:22.320\nand it has finished, so\nI can click Close on that.\n\n266\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.750\nAnd we'll open up our DNS console.\n\n267\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.240\nSo I'm going to go to Tools and then DNS.\n\n268\n00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.570\nAnd there's my DNS console,\nand I can see my server.\n\n269\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.870\nAnd as I expand that out,\nI'll see I've got a few things.\n\n270\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.596\nWe've got logs, we've got something\ncalled forward lookup zones,\n\n271\n00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:42.336\nreverse look up zones, trust points,\nand conditional forwarders.\n\n272\n00:13:42.336 --> 00:13:47.146\nForward look up zones, first, let's talk\nabout these terms here, forward lookup and\n\n273\n00:13:47.146 --> 00:13:48.121\nreverse lookup.\n\n274\n00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:51.350\nSo what we described earlier\nis known as a forward lookup.\n\n275\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.840\nYou know the name, and\nyou wanna turn that into an IP address.\n\n276\n00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.150\nListen, 90% of the time,\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n277\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.060\nI type in a name in my browser,\nand I need the IP address so\n\n278\n00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.390\nthat I can make that connection.\n\n279\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.510\nThat's a forward look up.\n\n280\n00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.601\nA reverse look up then\nwould be the opposite.\n\n281\n00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:09.627\nI know the IP address, I need the name.\n\n282\n00:14:09.627 --> 00:14:11.262\nYou've done this before most likely.\n\n283\n00:14:11.262 --> 00:14:14.020\nYou ever get a call\nfrom an unknown number?\n\n284\n00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.283\nIt just has a number there and no name, so\n\n285\n00:14:16.283 --> 00:14:20.758\nyou maybe try to use some service to look\nthat number up and see who it belongs to?\n\n286\n00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:23.410\nYou're doing a reverse\nlookup on that phone number.\n\n287\n00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.909\nNormally, you know the name\nof the person you wanna call.\n\n288\n00:14:25.909 --> 00:14:28.359\nAnd you look it up in the phone book or\non your contacts, and\n\n289\n00:14:28.359 --> 00:14:30.350\nyou're doing a forward lookup.\n\n290\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.210\nOccasionally though, you might call\nthe operator or use some service and\n\n291\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.280\nsay, hey, whose number is this?\n\n292\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.910\nThat would be a reverse lookup.\n\n293\n00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.260\nIn computer worlds, sometimes services use\nthis where they know an IP address and\n\n294\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:46.170\nthey wanna return the name of the machine\nthat's attempting to make that connection.\n\n295\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.440\nWebsites, we can use rules that say,\nonly if you belong to our domain\n\n296\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.400\nare you allowed to connect\nto this particular website.\n\n297\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.619\nWell ,how does the web server\nknow if you belong to the domain?\n\n298\n00:14:56.619 --> 00:15:00.280\nAll it has is you IP address and\nan HTTP get request.\n\n299\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.386\nWell, it can take that IP address,\ndo a reverse lookup with DNS.\n\n300\n00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:07.211\nSay, hey, what's the fully qualified\ndomain name that goes with this\n\n301\n00:15:07.211 --> 00:15:08.405\nIP address?\n\n302\n00:15:08.405 --> 00:15:13.540\nDagaba.ITPro.TV, okay, so you're part of\nITPro.TV, I'll let you connect, right?\n\n303\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.320\nIt used a reverse look\nup to determine that.\n\n304\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.100\nForward look up zones we have to have\nbecause that's what we do with DNS.\n\n305\n00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.770\nReverse look up zones are optional.\n\n306\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.390\nYou might have a very good reason to use\none because of a service like that or\n\n307\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.180\nsomething else that relies\non those reverse look ups.\n\n308\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.135\nBut you don't have to have one.\n\n309\n00:15:30.135 --> 00:15:33.550\nReversel lookups can help when we're doing\nlog correlation and things like that,\n\n310\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.720\ncuz a lot of times log\nfiles don't resolve.\n\n311\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.120\nSo I just have IP addresses in there, and\nI'd like to know what names go with them.\n\n312\n00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.855\nSo that's the difference between forward\nlookup zones, or forward lookup and\n\n313\n00:15:43.855 --> 00:15:44.919\nreverse lookup.\n\n314\n00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:47.480\nSo we say we're gonna contact DNS.\n\n315\n00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.230\nWe're gonna send what's called a query or\na question.\n\n316\n00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.949\nAnd we're gonna do a forward lookup,\nfor example.\n\n317\n00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:53.942\nI've got a name and I want an IP address.\n\n318\n00:15:53.942 --> 00:15:57.999\nWhen DNS receives this question,\nit's gonna look for\n\n319\n00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.160\nwhat's known as a zone file.\n\n320\n00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.217\nTo see if it has that information.\n\n321\n00:16:04.217 --> 00:16:13.100\nIf the name that I'm asking about\nsay server1.itpro.tv, right.\n\n322\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.830\nMy DNS server needs that information.\n\n323\n00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.450\nHow's it gonna look up\nserver1.itpro.tv and\n\n324\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.310\ngive me the IP address if it\ndoesn't have the information?\n\n325\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.390\nSo we have to create records\ninside our DNS server.\n\n326\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.580\nThey can be created manually,\nwhich I'll show you.\n\n327\n00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.756\nThey can also be created automatically,\nwhich we prefer.\n\n328\n00:16:31.756 --> 00:16:35.990\nBut there are times when we need\nto create manual records as well.\n\n329\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.260\nSo we'll create these records, and there's\nseveral different types of records.\n\n330\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:45.610\nBut the primary ones we're gonna start\nwith are A records and quad A records.\n\n331\n00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:50.360\nAn A record is an IPV for\nname to IP address mapping.\n\n332\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.760\nIt's a primary DNS resource record type.\n\n333\n00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.640\nIt's typically what we want.\n\n334\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.559\nAlthough now we're dealing with IPv6,\nwe have quad a.\n\n335\n00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:01.782\nThe name drives me crazy,\nCherokee, I don't know about you.\n\n336\n00:17:01.782 --> 00:17:03.839\nA-A-A-A records?\n\n337\n00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:07.619\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and there is a logical\nreasoning behind that, and\n\n338\n00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.844\nI can't remember off\nthe tip of my tongue here.\n\n339\n00:17:10.844 --> 00:17:11.905\nIt has to do with the bits, yeah.\n\n340\n00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:17.077\n&gt;&gt; It does, and it's because IPv6\nis four times the number of bits.\n\n341\n00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:17.725\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yep.\n\n342\n00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:20.446\n&gt;&gt; As IPv4, so we get\n&gt;&gt; You get four As.\n\n343\n00:17:20.446 --> 00:17:23.028\nI'm sorry, Microsoft,\nthat just drives me crazy.\n\n344\n00:17:23.028 --> 00:17:26.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have to go A-A-A-A record?\n\n345\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.213\nQuad As is not as bad, I guess.\n\n346\n00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.101\n&gt;&gt; At least they didn't name it triple A,\nand\n\n347\n00:17:30.101 --> 00:17:32.458\nthen you would get that confused with the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n348\n00:17:32.458 --> 00:17:34.427\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Emergency roadside assistance service.\n\n349\n00:17:34.427 --> 00:17:36.706\n&gt;&gt; Or if you're my age, the.\n\n350\n00:17:36.706 --> 00:17:39.202\nAnd so is there a AAA for\nthat too, for old people?\n\n351\n00:17:39.202 --> 00:17:40.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n352\n00:17:40.891 --> 00:17:43.255\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I'm thinking of.\n\n353\n00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:43.904\n&gt;&gt; Life Alert?\n\n354\n00:17:43.904 --> 00:17:46.912\n[LAUGH] Hey, straight from Florida.\n\n355\n00:17:46.912 --> 00:17:50.005\nClearwater, Florida,\nthat's where it was invented, yeah.\n\n356\n00:17:50.005 --> 00:17:50.945\n&gt;&gt; So where were we?\n\n357\n00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:51.935\nWe were talking about old people.\n\n358\n00:17:51.935 --> 00:17:54.297\nNo, we were talking\nabout resource records.\n\n359\n00:17:54.297 --> 00:17:56.537\n&gt;&gt; AARP, someone in chat typed that in.\n\n360\n00:17:56.537 --> 00:17:57.120\nYou got it, yeah.\n\n361\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:57.736\n&gt;&gt; AARP, thank you.\n\n362\n00:17:57.736 --> 00:17:59.392\nThere's Aubrey saving my day.\n\n363\n00:17:59.392 --> 00:18:03.050\nAll right, so there's only two As in\nthere, there's not three or four,\n\n364\n00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.505\nI was way off.\n\n365\n00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:08.584\nAll right, so in our database,\nwe're gonna create these resource records.\n\n366\n00:18:08.584 --> 00:18:10.376\nA records for IPv4 addresses.\n\n367\n00:18:10.376 --> 00:18:14.972\nThey would map\ndagaba.itpro.tv To 10.1.2.3.\n\n368\n00:18:14.972 --> 00:18:21.584\nThere would be a quad A record that\nsays hey, .itpro.tv is actually,\n\n369\n00:18:21.584 --> 00:18:26.928\ngosh if I could even make up one,\nFE80ABC12341234.\n\n370\n00:18:26.928 --> 00:18:30.720\nAn IPv6 address, 128 bits.\n\n371\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.670\nThere, so\nthose are the two main resource records.\n\n372\n00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.570\nBut, when we create those, and there's\nlots more, we're gonna talk about them.\n\n373\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.230\nBut when we create those resource records,\n\n374\n00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:43.420\nthey're stored in DNS in what's\ncalled a zone file, all right.\n\n375\n00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:50.145\nA zone file is a portion of the overall\nname space of the internet, all right.\n\n376\n00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:53.626\nAnd, while we'll, kind of,\ncome back to that concept in a minute, for\n\n377\n00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:55.840\nnow, let's just focus on our company.\n\n378\n00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.860\nRight, my company in my brand\nmachines here is lab.itpro.tv.\n\n379\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:07.090\nSo, if we go and look at my domain\ncontroller that we installed and\n\n380\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.740\nI take a look, I'm gonna open\nup my DNS console, right, so\n\n381\n00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:16.110\nDNS, and\nif I look at my forward look up zones.\n\n382\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.884\nI will see a zone file for lab.itpro.tv.\n\n383\n00:19:20.884 --> 00:19:26.769\nAll right, this is a database where I\ncan store all the resource records for\n\n384\n00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:32.281\nall the computers and other devices\nthat need these kind of records for\n\n385\n00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:35.848\nanybody whose name ends in lab.itpro.tv.\n\n386\n00:19:35.848 --> 00:19:39.946\nRight, that's what a zone file is for,\na specific portion of the name space.\n\n387\n00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:41.974\nIn this case lab.itpro.tv.\n\n388\n00:19:41.974 --> 00:19:42.987\nSo when we look in here,\n\n389\n00:19:42.987 --> 00:19:45.593\nI can see the different computers\nthat make up this network.\n\n390\n00:19:45.593 --> 00:19:52.403\nDC01.lab.itpro.tv, DC08,\nServ01, Core01, Client01.\n\n391\n00:19:52.403 --> 00:19:55.761\nNow there's other records, we'll talk\nabout those in just a minute, but\n\n392\n00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:57.209\nthese you notice are A records.\n\n393\n00:19:57.209 --> 00:20:02.396\nAnd if I double click on this A record for\nDC01 and I can see there's his name,\n\n394\n00:20:02.396 --> 00:20:07.273\nthere's the fully qualified domain\nname easywand.lab.itpro.tv and\n\n395\n00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:09.460\nthere's the IP address.\n\n396\n00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.450\nSo if someone calls up this DNS server and\n\n397\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:16.630\nsays hey what's the IP\naddress of dc01.lab.itpro.tv?\n\n398\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:21.353\nAll he has to do is look at this\na record and go it's 10.10.8.200 and\n\n399\n00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:23.655\nhe can return the response, all right.\n\n400\n00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:26.830\nWell that is how we're\ngoing to resolve names and\n\n401\n00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.927\nthis is what we call a zone five.\n\n402\n00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:32.456\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, some of us may be sitting here\nwondering well where did these records\n\n403\n00:20:32.456 --> 00:20:33.010\ncome from?\n\n404\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.742\nIs this something that's\nautomatically generated?\n\n405\n00:20:34.742 --> 00:20:36.366\nCan I create new records?\n\n406\n00:20:36.366 --> 00:20:37.270\nHow does that work?\n\n407\n00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.102\n&gt;&gt; That's a greay question, let's look.\n\n408\n00:20:39.102 --> 00:20:44.840\nWe can create them or they can be created\ndynamically, which is really what we want.\n\n409\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.028\nAll of these you see in here\nwith these time stamps,\n\n410\n00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:50.189\nthese were created dynamically.\n\n411\n00:20:50.189 --> 00:20:53.896\nMy two domain controllers do have\nstatic ones, we don't like changing\n\n412\n00:20:53.896 --> 00:20:57.252\nthe IP address of domain controllers,\nusually not a good idea.\n\n413\n00:20:57.252 --> 00:21:01.418\nBut the time-stamped ones,\nthose were created dynamically.\n\n414\n00:21:01.418 --> 00:21:06.034\nSo, when this server joined the domain,\nthe second thing he did\n\n415\n00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:10.668\nafter joining the domain,\nwas call the DNS, and say, hey DNS.\n\n416\n00:21:10.668 --> 00:21:14.042\nYou're responsible for\nlab.itpro.tv, right?\n\n417\n00:21:14.042 --> 00:21:16.308\nYou've got one of those own files for\nthem.\n\n418\n00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.920\nWell, I'm a new member of lab.itpro.tv.\n\n419\n00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.982\nMy name is Server01, and\nmy IP address is 10.10.8.201.\n\n420\n00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:25.698\nCan you make an A record for me so\n\n421\n00:21:25.698 --> 00:21:28.810\nthat other people can find me\nif they are looking for me?\n\n422\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.550\nThat's name registration.\n\n423\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.800\nThe machine is automatically\nregistering his IP address with DNS,\n\n424\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:40.720\nwhich is really what we want but there are\ntimes we need to create our own records.\n\n425\n00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.970\nLike we could manually create\nalias records for example.\n\n426\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.220\nSo before we do that,\nwell let's go ahead and create one and\n\n427\n00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.790\nthen we'll come back to it.\n\n428\n00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:56.754\nAll right, just for giggles, I'm going to\ntake a look at server one is 10.10.8.201.\n\n429\n00:21:56.754 --> 00:22:01.161\nThat is this guy right over here\nthat we'd just installed DNS on.\n\n430\n00:22:01.161 --> 00:22:06.033\nI'm gonna open up the command prompt\non this domain controller and\n\n431\n00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.948\nI'm gonna ping svr01.\n\n432\n00:22:07.948 --> 00:22:11.800\nAnd notice what it did\na couple of things here.\n\n433\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.224\nThe first thing it did was it took\nthat name that I typed in and\n\n434\n00:22:15.224 --> 00:22:17.911\nturned it into a fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n435\n00:22:17.911 --> 00:22:21.984\nBecause you can't just ask DNS what's\nthe IP address of Mike, right?\n\n436\n00:22:21.984 --> 00:22:23.543\nOr what's the IP address of Server01?\n\n437\n00:22:23.543 --> 00:22:25.133\nYou can't use just the first name.\n\n438\n00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:31.350\nYou have to include the full name, because\nthere might be a Server 1 in lab.itpro.tv.\n\n439\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:35.830\nBut there also might be\na server01 in training.itpro.tv.\n\n440\n00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.113\nAnd if you just say server01, how does\nit know which one you're referring to?\n\n441\n00:22:40.113 --> 00:22:44.559\nSo you have to use a fully qualified\ndomain name so it can find the DNS server\n\n442\n00:22:44.559 --> 00:22:49.520\nthat holds the zone file for that\nnamespace so it can look up that name.\n\n443\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.426\nThat server that holds that zone file is\nknown as the authoritative server for\n\n444\n00:22:54.426 --> 00:22:58.364\nthat zone because he is the one\nthat actually has the records.\n\n445\n00:22:58.364 --> 00:23:03.482\nHe can look in his database and\nsay this is the IP address of Server01.\n\n446\n00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:06.538\nI know that because I'm looking\nat the record right now, right?\n\n447\n00:23:06.538 --> 00:23:11.091\nSo he is considered authoritative if he\nholds the zone file, the DNS server is.\n\n448\n00:23:11.091 --> 00:23:13.725\nSo we turned it into a fully\nqualified domain name, and\n\n449\n00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:17.408\nthen it resolved in the name\ninto an IP address, 10.10.8.201.\n\n450\n00:23:17.408 --> 00:23:20.999\nAnd then it pinged That IP address\nbecause we didn't ping the name,\n\n451\n00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:24.152\ncomputers can't connect to names,\nonly to IP addresses.\n\n452\n00:23:24.152 --> 00:23:28.546\n&gt;&gt; Which is a great way if you remember\nfrom like those COMPTIA classes or\n\n453\n00:23:28.546 --> 00:23:31.442\nany kind of other\nfundamental type courses.\n\n454\n00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:34.221\nAnd you're looking at that and\nif you didn't get that return,\n\n455\n00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:37.737\nthat IP address then it would be a good\nindication that something within your DNS\n\n456\n00:23:37.737 --> 00:23:39.011\nwasn't working properly.\n\n457\n00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:42.519\nAnd you could continue to troubleshoot\nby trying to ping that IP address\n\n458\n00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:43.340\nspecifically.\n\n459\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.360\nAnd if you got a response,\n\n460\n00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.740\nyou knew that machine was up,\nthe communication was happening, and\n\n461\n00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.222\nthat would be a clue as to go ahead and\ninvestigate a little bit further.\n\n462\n00:23:51.222 --> 00:23:54.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it could be DNS is not working,\nif you can ping it by IP address but\n\n463\n00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:54.989\nnot by name.\n\n464\n00:23:54.989 --> 00:23:56.814\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Something is preventing you from\n\n465\n00:23:56.814 --> 00:24:00.053\nresolving that into a name, either on\nyour client end or On the DNS end, or\n\n466\n00:24:00.053 --> 00:24:02.423\nin a network in between,\nbut definitely something.\n\n467\n00:24:02.423 --> 00:24:07.476\nAll right, so let's make a record,\ncuz that's what Cherokee wanted to do.\n\n468\n00:24:07.476 --> 00:24:11.647\nSo we are gonna right click on here,\nwhen you right click in the zone, so\n\n469\n00:24:11.647 --> 00:24:15.204\nI've gone to lab.ITPro.TV,\nand I'm gonna right click.\n\n470\n00:24:15.204 --> 00:24:19.794\nYou'll see that I have a few options\nright here on my menu, New Host (A or\n\n471\n00:24:19.794 --> 00:24:24.632\nAAAA) New Alias, Mail Exchanger, but\nthat's the only three I get there.\n\n472\n00:24:24.632 --> 00:24:27.666\nLet's talk about the other\nrecords as well while we're here,\n\n473\n00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:29.620\nat least the ones they cover on the exam.\n\n474\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:34.231\nSo we talked about A and AAAA,\nthose are named IP address,\n\n475\n00:24:34.231 --> 00:24:36.970\nIPv4 and IPv6, respectively.\n\n476\n00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.680\nNS records, which I don't see on this\nlist, let's go away from this list for\n\n477\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.300\na second, here's a couple.\n\n478\n00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.513\nNS are name server records,\nthese are how you find\n\n479\n00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:53.249\nthe authoritative DNS server,\nwho is the DNS server for this zone?\n\n480\n00:24:53.249 --> 00:24:56.770\nThat's an NS record, or\na name server record.\n\n481\n00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:02.830\nThere's also MX records, which I don't\nhave here, MX are mail exchanger records.\n\n482\n00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.000\nSo when you're trying to find your\nmailbox server, you would query DNS for\n\n483\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.130\nthe MX records.\n\n484\n00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.715\nSRV records are service locator records,\n\n485\n00:25:12.715 --> 00:25:17.260\nnow those, we talked about when\nwe did our Active Directory.\n\n486\n00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:22.232\nBut SRV records, and notice I'm still\nin my zone, I'm gonna go down to TCP.\n\n487\n00:25:22.232 --> 00:25:26.090\nThey're in several places,\nI'm just using TCP as an example.\n\n488\n00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.065\nSRV records are service locator records,\nand\n\n489\n00:25:29.065 --> 00:25:33.090\nthese allow me to find what computer\nis running a particular service.\n\n490\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.610\nI might wanna log in, so\n\n491\n00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.876\nI call up DNS and I say, hey,\nwhich servers are running Kerberos, right?\n\n492\n00:25:38.876 --> 00:25:42.981\nCuz that's my authentication\nprotocol that I wanna use.\n\n493\n00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:47.841\nAnd DNS will look for an SRV record,\nKeberos, Keberos, here's two.\n\n494\n00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:50.561\nLet's see who's running Kerberos,\n\n495\n00:25:50.561 --> 00:25:56.010\nit looks like DC08 is running Kerberos,\nand DC01 is running Kerberos.\n\n496\n00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.620\nSo I've got two servers that have SRV\n\n497\n00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.120\nrecords saying that\nthey're running Kerberos.\n\n498\n00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.862\nImportant thing to note right here,\nwhen we look at this record,\n\n499\n00:26:05.862 --> 00:26:10.883\nnotice that this SRV record says,\nthis server is running Kerberos.\n\n500\n00:26:10.883 --> 00:26:17.932\nWhat do you not see in this dialogue box,\nthink about it for a second.\n\n501\n00:26:17.932 --> 00:26:19.666\n&gt;&gt; Time stamp information.\n\n502\n00:26:19.666 --> 00:26:22.380\n&gt;&gt; No,\nI don't see time stamp information, but\n\n503\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:26.150\nthe other thing I don't see\nis an IP address, right?\n\n504\n00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:32.640\nThere's no IP address in here,\nSRV records do not map IP addresses.\n\n505\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.160\nSRV records map services to\nfully qualified domain names.\n\n506\n00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.260\nSo when you look up an SRV record,\n\n507\n00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.220\nit returns a host that's\noffering the service.\n\n508\n00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.060\nIt says, if you're looking for Kerberos,\nhere's the guy that's running Kerberos.\n\n509\n00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.274\nThat still doesn't do me any good,\nI can't connect to a name,\n\n510\n00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:50.080\nI have to have an IP address.\n\n511\n00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.760\nSo once I get that response,\nI then have to query DNS and say, okay,\n\n512\n00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.740\nyou told me DC01 is running Kerberos,\nwhat's DC01's IP address?\n\n513\n00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.615\nAnd then DNS says, well,\nif you want the IP address,\n\n514\n00:27:01.615 --> 00:27:05.168\nlet me just do a standard lookup,\nDC01 is 10.10.8.200.\n\n515\n00:27:05.168 --> 00:27:09.310\nSo SRV records point me to the name of\nthe server that's offering the service.\n\n516\n00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:13.350\nBut then I still have to take that\nname and turn it into an IP address.\n\n517\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.529\nJust make sure you understand that,\nthat's an easy test question gotcha.\n\n518\n00:27:17.529 --> 00:27:21.615\nCuz when we talk about DNS, we're normally\ntalking about name to IP address.\n\n519\n00:27:21.615 --> 00:27:25.774\nSRV records are a little different,\nthey map service to name, and\n\n520\n00:27:25.774 --> 00:27:28.460\nthen we still have to\ngo name to IP address.\n\n521\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.575\n[COUGH] All right,\nlast type of record I wanna point out, and\n\n522\n00:27:32.575 --> 00:27:35.080\nthis is by far not all-inclusive.\n\n523\n00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.480\nThere are dozens of other record types we\ncan work with, but those are the main ones\n\n524\n00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.090\nwe wanna focus on while we're\ngetting started in Windows here.\n\n525\n00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.530\nThe last one I wanna talk about is\nsomething known as PTR records.\n\n526\n00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.560\nI don't have any in here cuz I\ndon't have a reverse lookup zone.\n\n527\n00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.556\nRemember, I told you, reverse lookup\nzones are actually optional, and\n\n528\n00:27:53.556 --> 00:27:54.583\nI haven't created one.\n\n529\n00:27:54.583 --> 00:27:58.601\nAlthough we will here in just a minute,\nI keep saying that, why don't we do it?\n\n530\n00:27:58.601 --> 00:28:03.690\nBecause we don't know anything about new\nzones yet, let's not jump too far ahead.\n\n531\n00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:08.090\nSo reverse lookup zones would\nmap IP addresses back to names.\n\n532\n00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.977\nSo it's gonna look very similar to\nan A record, except it's opposite, right.\n\n533\n00:28:11.977 --> 00:28:15.745\nYou're gonna have an IP address, and\nyou're gonna map it back to a name.\n\n534\n00:28:15.745 --> 00:28:18.531\nThe IP address is listed reverse,\nthough, and\n\n535\n00:28:18.531 --> 00:28:20.976\nI'll show you what I mean in a little bit.\n\n536\n00:28:20.976 --> 00:28:25.456\nBecause it goes from most specific,\nwell, the network address is at the end.\n\n537\n00:28:25.456 --> 00:28:27.048\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's definitely different, and\n\n538\n00:28:27.048 --> 00:28:29.514\nit's definitely a good thing to\nlook at and be able to identify.\n\n539\n00:28:29.514 --> 00:28:31.786\nBecause you might see that again\nin something in the future too.\n\n540\n00:28:31.786 --> 00:28:35.786\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and so\nwe'll create one here, in just a minute,\n\n541\n00:28:35.786 --> 00:28:38.890\nI know we're getting\na little bit short on time.\n\n542\n00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.566\nLet me just make sure, so\nwe've talked about zones,\n\n543\n00:28:41.566 --> 00:28:44.365\nwe've talked about forward and\nreverse lookup zones.\n\n544\n00:28:44.365 --> 00:28:47.992\nWe've talked about our resource records,\nand\n\n545\n00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:51.264\nwe installed DNS, we saw that over there.\n\n546\n00:28:51.264 --> 00:28:54.855\nI wanna finish this off talking\nabout zone types, all right.\n\n547\n00:28:54.855 --> 00:29:00.230\nBecause I said that a zone is\na place to store resource records,\n\n548\n00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:04.120\nit's a part of a database, if you will.\n\n549\n00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.649\nBut there's more than one type\nof zone that we can create,\n\n550\n00:29:07.649 --> 00:29:09.890\nwhen we create a new zone within DNS.\n\n551\n00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:15.472\nI'm gonna flip over to my brand new\ninstalled server that we just did.\n\n552\n00:29:15.472 --> 00:29:19.413\nI'm gonna right click on forward lookup\nzones, and I'm gonna choose New Zone.\n\n553\n00:29:19.413 --> 00:29:22.810\nOne, notice I don't have\nany zones by default, okay,\n\n554\n00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:27.672\nthat's something you wanna keep in mind\n[COUGH] with a non-domain controller.\n\n555\n00:29:27.672 --> 00:29:30.620\nAnd we'll kind of see what I\nmean by that as we go here.\n\n556\n00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:35.923\nSo here's my New Zone Wizard, I'm gonna\nclick Next, and then I get this choice.\n\n557\n00:29:35.923 --> 00:29:41.230\nDo I want primary, do I want secondary,\nor do I want stub zones?\n\n558\n00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.740\nAnd grayed out is,\nstore this zone in Active Directory,\n\n559\n00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.328\navailable only if the DNS server is on\na writable domain controller, all right?\n\n560\n00:29:51.328 --> 00:29:53.907\nSo that one's out of\nthe question in this case,\n\n561\n00:29:53.907 --> 00:29:57.851\nbecause it's not on a domain controller,\nthis is just a member server.\n\n562\n00:29:57.851 --> 00:30:01.120\nSo let's talk about these first three\nhere, well, at least the first two.\n\n563\n00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.233\nWe'll probably come back to stub zones\ncuz that's a little bit of an oddball.\n\n564\n00:30:04.233 --> 00:30:09.030\nBut it's a very cool zone, but\nit's not what we normally deal with.\n\n565\n00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:15.510\nSo a primary zone is a what we call\na read/write copy of a zone file.\n\n566\n00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.408\nSo all that means is,\n\n567\n00:30:16.408 --> 00:30:20.280\nit's a zone file, just like you saw for\nITPro.tv on my other server.\n\n568\n00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.023\nAnd it can store resource records, and\nwe can make changes, it's a writable copy.\n\n569\n00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:28.948\nSo we can update existing records,\nwe can create new records,\n\n570\n00:30:28.948 --> 00:30:33.181\nwe can delete records,\nit's a writable copy, so let's make one.\n\n571\n00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:37.676\nLet's right click on here,\nwe'll go primary,\n\n572\n00:30:37.676 --> 00:30:43.660\nI'll click Next, and\nwe'll call this dev.lab.itpro.tv.\n\n573\n00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.660\nWe'll just get really crazy with\nthe name here, or let's not go that far,\n\n574\n00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.220\nlet's just go dev.itpro.tv.\n\n575\n00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:56.902\nWe'll click Next, and then do I want to\ncreate a new file with this file name?\n\n576\n00:30:56.902 --> 00:30:59.271\nWell, yes, I need somewhere, the database,\n\n577\n00:30:59.271 --> 00:31:03.830\nI need somewhere to actually store these\nrecords that we're going to be creating.\n\n578\n00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:08.090\nIf I already had a file, if I was\nrebuilding a DNS server and I had a backup\n\n579\n00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:11.400\nof the old zone file, I could have\ncopied that over to this machine.\n\n580\n00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.530\nAnd then said, no, use an existing file,\nand just pointed to it.\n\n581\n00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.182\nBut I don't have one yet, so\nwe're gonna create a new one.\n\n582\n00:31:17.182 --> 00:31:21.331\nNotice it adds the .dns to the end of it,\nall right.\n\n583\n00:31:21.331 --> 00:31:26.921\nWe'll click Next, and then here,\ndo I want to allow both nonsecure and\n\n584\n00:31:26.921 --> 00:31:31.591\nsecure dynamic updates, or\ndo not allow dynamic updates?\n\n585\n00:31:31.591 --> 00:31:36.317\nNotice my option for secure only is grayed\nout, that's only available on domain\n\n586\n00:31:36.317 --> 00:31:39.952\ncontrollers, but\nwe'll come back to that concept, right?\n\n587\n00:31:39.952 --> 00:31:42.410\nBoth nonsecure and\n\n588\n00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:46.240\nsecure, only reason I get to chose this\nis because nonsecure is an option.\n\n589\n00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.570\nI can't do secure updates\nwith a standard primary,\n\n590\n00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.580\nor I could not allow dynamic updates.\n\n591\n00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.515\nThere are times when you want to\nuse that option, like if you've got\n\n592\n00:31:55.515 --> 00:31:59.139\nan Internet-facing DNS server, you might\nbe creating all the records manually.\n\n593\n00:31:59.139 --> 00:32:03.058\nAnd you don't want anybody attempting to\nconnect to it, and make their own records.\n\n594\n00:32:03.058 --> 00:32:06.111\nCuz they could be using that as\na form of an attack against you or\n\n595\n00:32:06.111 --> 00:32:08.650\nyour organization or somebody else.\n\n596\n00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.630\nSo there are times when you choose\ndo not allow dynamic updates.\n\n597\n00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:12.580\nMore often than not, though,\n\n598\n00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.686\nif it's internal I want the clients to\nbe able to register their own records.\n\n599\n00:32:16.686 --> 00:32:20.510\nI don't wanna have to manually create\nrecords because that's when typos occur,\n\n600\n00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.050\nduplication occurs, this causes problems.\n\n601\n00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.060\nWe have human related errors and\nwe don't like those.\n\n602\n00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.840\n&gt;&gt; Dang those humans.\n\n603\n00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.072\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I know, we're so crazy.\n\n604\n00:32:28.072 --> 00:32:29.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n605\n00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:33.350\nI'm gonna choose Allow both nonsecure and\nsecure, I'll click Next, and\n\n606\n00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:37.690\nFinish, and there we go,\nI have a new zone dev.itpro.tv.\n\n607\n00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:41.080\nWe'll talk about the records\nwe find in here in a minute.\n\n608\n00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.810\nAnd I know Cherokee is giving me the eye.\n\n609\n00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.640\nIt looks like I can't go any faster.\n\n610\n00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.780\nWe're just gonna have to come back.\n\n611\n00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.170\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, I forgot to give\nyou like the five minute warning.\n\n612\n00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.122\nSo I have to give him\nlike an extra five here.\n\n613\n00:32:50.122 --> 00:32:52.784\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, do [CROSSTALK].\n\n614\n00:32:52.784 --> 00:32:53.356\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n615\n00:32:53.356 --> 00:32:54.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right.\n\n616\n00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.230\nLet's keep waking these zones then.\n\n617\n00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.350\nSo here's our standard primary.\n\n618\n00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.590\nThis is our read, write copy.\n\n619\n00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:05.680\nAnd just to show you I could come in\nhere and create a new A record test.\n\n620\n00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.820\nNotice it fills in the DEV.IT.PROTV\nbecause that's the zone I'm in.\n\n621\n00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.100\nSo everything in here has to end in that.\n\n622\n00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.030\nSo there's no choice.\n\n623\n00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.960\nYou just type in the host name and\nthen it fills in the rest for you.\n\n624\n00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.180\nAnd I'll just make up something,\n10, 10, 8, 155.\n\n625\n00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.450\nI don't think that's any use.\n\n626\n00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.110\nI could create a PTR record\nautomatically right here,\n\n627\n00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.970\nif I had a reverse lookup zone.\n\n628\n00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:32.880\nIt would make a record that says,\nthis IP address maps back to this FQDN.\n\n629\n00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.050\nBut I don't, so I'm gonna click Add Host,\nI'll click OK, and then Done.\n\n630\n00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.690\nAnd now we'll see that I have\na new a record in there.\n\n631\n00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:45.270\nSo this is the writeable copy of the zone.\n\n632\n00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.730\nAll right, now I'm gonna create a,\n\n633\n00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:54.210\nhow can I do this without getting\ntoo far ahead of you guys?\n\n634\n00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.490\nLet's create a secondary.\n\n635\n00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.990\nIt's not gonna let me without a master.\n\n636\n00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.140\nWe haven't really talked about that.\n\n637\n00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.290\nLet me go over my domain controller.\n\n638\n00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:11.360\nAnd I'll make another zone over here\ncuz eventually we'll make this work.\n\n639\n00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.480\nIt's not gonna work at first for\ncertain reasons, but\n\n640\n00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.740\nwe'll come back and we'll explain why.\n\n641\n00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.730\nSo I'm gonna say New Zone, Next.\n\n642\n00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.270\nThis time, I'm gonna choose Secondary.\n\n643\n00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.490\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n644\n00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:31.166\nAnd my zone name is gonna be dev.itpro.tv.\n\n645\n00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:34.730\nI'll click Next.\n\n646\n00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.230\nAnd then my master 10.10.8.201.\n\n647\n00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:43.390\nI'll talk about what the heck\nthis is in just a minute.\n\n648\n00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:44.430\nWell, I hate doing that.\n\n649\n00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:47.310\nHow much time did you say I had?\n\n650\n00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna have to be\nthe Debbie Downer now, yeah.\n\n651\n00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.610\n&gt;&gt; No, okay.\n\n652\n00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:54.960\nAll right, we'll leave you right there.\n\n653\n00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.430\n&gt;&gt; It's a cliff hanger, yeah.\n\n654\n00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:57.080\n&gt;&gt; A cliff hanger.\n\n655\n00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:57.640\nI like it.\n\n656\n00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, Mike.\n\n657\n00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.309\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n658\n00:35:00.309 --> 00:35:04.228\nAnd thank you for joining us as well, but\nyou definitely don't want to miss this\n\n659\n00:35:04.228 --> 00:35:07.811\nupcoming episode because then you'll\nnever know what that was, yeah.\n\n660\n00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:08.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n661\n00:35:08.316 --> 00:35:09.100\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But for\n\n662\n00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.120\nnow we'll go ahead and sign out,\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n663\n00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:12.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n664\n00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.854\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on

00:00:08.038\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:11.699\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.693\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your 70-410 series.\n\n6\n00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:16.700\nI am your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.600\nThis is a part two, in the last episode,\nMike was in the studios with us,\n\n8\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.740\nhe showed how to go ahead and\ninstall and start configuring, and\n\n9\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.080\nlooking at different types of records\nwithin the DNS management console.\n\n10\n00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.050\nAnd we're able to get him back in studios\ntoday to help cover this topic and, well,\n\n11\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.700\nyou left us with a cliffhanger, Mike,\nso what are we looking at there?\n\n12\n00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.530\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, everybody came back\nto see what the heck is gonna\n\n13\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.010\nhappen with that wizard.\n\n14\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.270\nYes, and thank you for having me back.\n\n15\n00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n16\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.240\n&gt;&gt; And yes,\nwe're gonna just dive right back in.\n\n17\n00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.830\nWe left off at part one,\n\n18\n00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.710\nwe had created a standard primary zone,\nwhich was a read, write zone.\n\n19\n00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.470\nWe were able to create new records.\n\n20\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.020\nAnd now I'm on a different DNS server,\n\n21\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.140\nactually, the domain controller,\ncreating a standard secondary zone.\n\n22\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.760\nAnd we're going through the wizard, and so\n\n23\n00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.780\nif you look at my screen here, I'll just\nback up real quick to refresh this, right?\n\n24\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.420\nAll we did was say, I created a standard,\nor a secondary zone.\n\n25\n00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.800\nI'm going to click next,\nI give it a zone name.\n\n26\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.750\nNow, I think, and then I click next and\n\n27\n00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.860\nthen we put the IP address\nof what the master is.\n\n28\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.020\nI'll go ahead and finish it and\n\n29\n00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.540\nthen I'm going to explain all this\nstuff that we're looking at here.\n\n30\n00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.170\nI'll click Next and\nFinish and now I have a zone.\n\n31\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.840\nAnd it tells me the zone is\nnot loaded by DNS server.\n\n32\n00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.600\nIt encountered a problem while\nattempting to load the zone.\n\n33\n00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.990\nSo let's talk about this\nsecondary zone for a second.\n\n34\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.060\nI'm gonna pull up the Properties here.\n\n35\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.400\nActually I think we can\nlook at some of this,\n\n36\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.300\nactually it's not going to help us at all.\n\n37\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.270\nSo I'm going to close properties, but\nhere's the thing, with standard primaries,\n\n38\n00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.260\nand understand that, gosh when was it?\n\n39\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.150\n2003, I think that we got active\ndirectory integrated zones.\n\n40\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.940\nThere's a third type of zone known as\nactive directory integrated zones.\n\n41\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.960\nBut before we had those\nstandard primary and secondary.\n\n42\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.760\nAs you see in the wizard, they're actually\njust called primary and secondary.\n\n43\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.420\nA lot of us refer to him\nas standard zones cuz,\n\n44\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.260\nonce we got Active Directory integrated,\nwe had to differentiate somehow.\n\n45\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.090\nSo those were just standard zones.\n\n46\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.150\nBut a primary zone is a read, write copy.\n\n47\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.890\nAnd, this was our main zone file.\n\n48\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.570\nThis was where we put all\nthe resource records.\n\n49\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.250\nThis is where clients dynamically\nregistered, and when I say client,\n\n50\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.430\nkeep in mind I'm referring to DNS client,\nnot client operating system.\n\n51\n00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.080\nAnybody that uses DNS is\na client of that service.\n\n52\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.490\nSo a member server that needs to look\nup a name is a DNS client, right?\n\n53\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.470\nIt's using a service so it's a client.\n\n54\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.460\nSo when I say client,\ndon't think client operating systems.\n\n55\n00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.280\nBut a standard primary is where we\nput all those resource records.\n\n56\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.310\nAnd when you need to resolve a name,\nyou call it up.\n\n57\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.860\nIf you needed to modify a record,\nif a client's IP address changed,\n\n58\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.640\nif we had dynamic updates, it could call\nup DNS and say hey, my name's Server01.\n\n59\n00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.190\nMy IP address is now 10.10.8.202,\ncan you update my record?\n\n60\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.818\nBecause it's primary, a read,\nwrite copy, we can make those changes.\n\n61\n00:03:07.818 --> 00:03:11.110\nBut the downsides of those primary\nzones was I can only have one.\n\n62\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.840\nAnd that's never good, right?\n\n63\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.600\nWe always talk about fall tolerance and\n\n64\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.160\nany time you have one of something that\nbecomes a single point of failure.\n\n65\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.750\nAnd if that server goes down,\nwe've said how important DNS is and\n\n66\n00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.560\nhow everything relies on it.\n\n67\n00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.330\nJust simply logging in without\nDNS isn't gonna work, so\n\n68\n00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.330\nyour whole business stops if that\nDNS server goes down, right?\n\n69\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.320\nSo we definitely want more than one, but\n\n70\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.140\nthe problem is I can only\nhave one writable copy,\n\n71\n00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.590\nbecause if I have two writable copies\nnow I can run into replication issues.\n\n72\n00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.390\nWhat if I'm on one server updating server\n01's resource record to it's new IP\n\n73\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.630\naddress, Cherokee's on the other writable\nDNS server updating the same record?\n\n74\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.340\nNow, when those two servers replicate and\nshe put a different IP address.\n\n75\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.550\nShe thought they were changing it to do a\n3, I thought they were changing it to 202.\n\n76\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.740\nSo, we've made entries on these two\nDNS servers to the same record, but\n\n77\n00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.840\nthey don't agree.\n\n78\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.760\nWhen replication occurs,\nwhich one are they gonna keep?\n\n79\n00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.880\n&gt;&gt; The last.\n\n80\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.858\n&gt;&gt; Well, so\nwe gotta throw one of them away.\n\n81\n00:04:12.858 --> 00:04:14.886\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That means we're losing data, and\n\n82\n00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:18.340\nmost likely it's the last update,\nexactly, is gonna win.\n\n83\n00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.868\nSo because I work slower than Cherokee,\nI win.\n\n84\n00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:23.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Woo hoo.\n\n85\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.980\n&gt;&gt; So that’s a problem.\n\n86\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.520\nWe can only have one, but one leaves\nme with a single point of failure, but\n\n87\n00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.820\nthat’s the reason we can only have one\nbecause of replication conflicts, and\n\n88\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.220\nthere was no built in\nway to deal with that.\n\n89\n00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.630\nSo the solution was, hey I’m going to let\nyou have more copies of that zone file.\n\n90\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.170\nYou can have other servers host\ncopies of the zone file, but\n\n91\n00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.670\nthey're going to have\nto be read only copies.\n\n92\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.050\nThat's where the secondary zone is.\n\n93\n00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.490\nA secondary is a read only\ncopy of a primary zone.\n\n94\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.900\nAnd so now,\nI have multiple copies of the zone file.\n\n95\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.480\nI can have one secondary,\ntwo secondaries, ten secondaries.\n\n96\n00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.460\nWhatever I needed for performance or\nfault tolerance, I could do.\n\n97\n00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.820\nStill only one primary, but\nas many secondaries as I wanted, right?\n\n98\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.810\nCuz they are read only.\n\n99\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.590\nNow, downside about that,\nis if the primary fails,\n\n100\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.050\nthe secondary is just still there.\n\n101\n00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.340\nAnd if somebody wants to look up\nsomething, they got a copy of the database\n\n102\n00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.240\nand they can look up the name,\nreturn the IP address, no problem.\n\n103\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.858\nBusiness going on as usual.\n\n104\n00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:26.410\n&gt;&gt; But what if a change happens?\n\n105\n00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.223\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n106\n00:05:27.223 --> 00:05:28.880\nthat's going to be an issue, right?\n\n107\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.380\nWe just said it's a read only copy.\n\n108\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.940\nSo what if an update needs to be made?\n\n109\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.910\nWhat if a new computer\nhas joined the domain and\n\n110\n00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.160\nit wants to register its name in DNS?\n\n111\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.680\nIt's not going to happen until\nthe primary comes back up\n\n112\n00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.050\nbecause the secondaries are read only,\nso it's just going to fail.\n\n113\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.350\nWhich at the time, before we had anything\nelse, we dealt with that, right?\n\n114\n00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.130\nWe had to get the primary back\nup as soon as possible, but\n\n115\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.440\nat least we could still continue to work.\n\n116\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.140\nWe just couldn't make anything new or\n\n117\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.630\nchanges until the primary\ncame back online.\n\n118\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.300\nThe secondary is a read only copy,\n\n119\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.170\nwhich means it needs to get the copy\nfrom somewhere or someone, and\n\n120\n00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.360\nthat someone being another DNS server\nthat has a copy of that zone file.\n\n121\n00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.870\nSo when we went through this wizard,\nlet's delete this and do it again.\n\n122\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.560\nJust so that you can now go,\nthose options are making sense.\n\n123\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.320\nAll right, well let's fix something first.\n\n124\n00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.290\nSo what we're gonna do, I deleted the zone\nthat we just created, dev.itpro.tv.\n\n125\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.300\nWe'll create another secondary.\n\n126\n00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.830\nBut let me finish one more\nconcept before we do that.\n\n127\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.900\nSo the secondary has to get\nits copy from somewhere.\n\n128\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.790\nWe're gonna point it to\nwhat's known as its master.\n\n129\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.890\nIts master is who it gets the copy from.\n\n130\n00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.260\nMake sure you understand that it\ndoes not have to be a primary.\n\n131\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.510\nYeah, crazy, right?\n\n132\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.150\nA secondary could get its\ncopy from another secondary.\n\n133\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.210\nWhy not?\nIt's just a copy of the database.\n\n134\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.230\nSo you could have a secondary that\npull his copy from a primary and\n\n135\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.940\nthen another secondary that pulls its\ncopy from the first secondary, right?\n\n136\n00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.540\nNow I would say that's rarely done\nbecause it's not really efficient.\n\n137\n00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.150\nTypically we do a hocus pocus where\nthe primary is in the middle and\n\n138\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.230\nall secondaries point back into\nthe primary to get their copy.\n\n139\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.460\nThat way when a change is made at the\nprimary, all the secondaries can get it,\n\n140\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.650\nwhereas when I'm in a bus or\na chain of secondaries,\n\n141\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.300\nthe update has to slowly work its\nway down the snake of secondaries.\n\n142\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.350\nYou don't see that very often but\nfor exam purposes or any other time,\n\n143\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.910\nunderstand that the master, master and\nprimary are not synonymous.\n\n144\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.900\nWhen it says, hey, who's the master?\n\n145\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.630\nYou don't have to point it to the primary,\nall right, just you know.\n\n146\n00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.645\nSecond thing we gotta do before we\nfix our problem is fix that problem.\n\n147\n00:07:45.645 --> 00:07:47.599\n[LAUGH] Wait,\nthat didn't make sense at all.\n\n148\n00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:52.188\nThe thing we've got to do to fix the\nproblem is we got an error because when\n\n149\n00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:55.124\nyou tell a secondary\nhey here's your master,\n\n150\n00:07:55.124 --> 00:07:57.999\nthat's who you're gonna get the copy from.\n\n151\n00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:01.606\nWell when it reaches out it says,\nhey I want a copy of your zone file.\n\n152\n00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.821\nThe server says, who are you?\n\n153\n00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:06.000\nAnd should I give you a copy?\n\n154\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.130\nRight?\n\n155\n00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.860\nWe wanna control who gets\ncopies of the zone file.\n\n156\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.430\nWe don't wanna let anybody just call\nup the DNS server and say, hey,\n\n157\n00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.840\ngive me a copy of your zone file.\n\n158\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.340\nAs a bad guy, a copy of a zone file is.\n\n159\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.970\nGood.\n\n160\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.180\nIt is a road map to your entire network.\n\n161\n00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.698\nIt's every machine's name.\n\n162\n00:08:23.698 --> 00:08:25.298\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n163\n00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:26.687\nIt's every machines name and\n\n164\n00:08:26.687 --> 00:08:29.780\nIP address, it's which computers\nare running which services.\n\n165\n00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.140\nSo, I wanna target your mail server\nI know which point it is because I\n\n166\n00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.080\nhave your MX record right\nhere in your zone file.\n\n167\n00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.330\n&gt;&gt; Well that also brings up another idea,\nMike.\n\n168\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.270\nAre the attackers able\nto modify these files?\n\n169\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.690\nAnd you know, is that something\nwe should be concerned with?\n\n170\n00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.270\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely is and\n\n171\n00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.760\nthat's where that whole secured dynamic\nupdates is going to come into play.\n\n172\n00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.370\nSo again, cliff hanger.\n\n173\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.950\nHold on to that thought.\n\n174\n00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.330\nAll right, so the problem,\n\n175\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.410\nthe reason I was getting in\nthe error is I created a secondary.\n\n176\n00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.540\nI pointed t to his master, but the master\nwas saying, I don't know who you are and\n\n177\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.300\nI have been told that\nis okay to give a copy.\n\n178\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.910\nSo let's go and fix that real quick.\n\n179\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.980\nGonna go back to server one.\n\n180\n00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.798\nand we are going to pull up\nthe properties of DEV.Pro.ITV and\n\n181\n00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:13.300\nwe're gonna go to the zone transfers tab.\n\n182\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.970\nAnd you can see by default, allow zone\ntransfers, only to serve as listed on\n\n183\n00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.420\nthe name service tab, and\nI don't have any in there.\n\n184\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:20.980\n&gt;&gt; Nothing is there.\n\n185\n00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:21.572\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n186\n00:09:21.572 --> 00:09:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, there's none in\n\n187\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.519\nhere because this is\na brand new zone I've made.\n\n188\n00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:25.420\nThere's no NS records.\n\n189\n00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.760\nOr anything like that.\n\n190\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.530\nNow I can create an NS record.\n\n191\n00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.830\nEventually that would pop up into\nthis screen and we'd be good to go.\n\n192\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.890\nFor this option here, to any server,\nplease don't choose that\n\n193\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.450\nbecause that means anybody can ask for\na copy of the zone.\n\n194\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.100\nThat means I can walk into your network,\nopen up a command prompt, and\n\n195\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.730\nuse nslookup to get\na copy of your zone file.\n\n196\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.630\nDo not choose this option.\n\n197\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.970\nI’m going to choose only the following,\n\n198\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.300\nbecause I don’t want to wait for the NS\nrecords to populate and things like that.\n\n199\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.900\nI’m just a click edit, and\n\n200\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:03.025\nI’m going to say that 10.10.8.200\nis an authorized secondary server.\n\n201\n00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:04.445\nI'm gonna add him to the list.\n\n202\n00:10:04.445 --> 00:10:08.855\nEventually this should turn green as long\nas I type in the IP address correctly\n\n203\n00:10:09.855 --> 00:10:10.645\nwhich I know I did.\n\n204\n00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:15.455\nYou could wait for it if you wanted to or\nyou could just go ahead and\n\n205\n00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:18.090\nclick okay and\njust assume it's gonna work.\n\n206\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.980\nIf you wanna double check\nit you can go back in and\n\n207\n00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.480\nyou can see it's still trying\nto resolve eventually.\n\n208\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.910\nI'm pretty sure that's\nthe right IP address.\n\n209\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.070\nYeah, it is.\nWell we'll get that.\n\n210\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.500\nIt'll pop up here in just a minute.\n\n211\n00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.030\nYou can see it's already\nresolved the FPDN.\n\n212\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.040\nEverything's looking good.\n\n213\n00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.330\nSo now the master.\n\n214\n00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.260\nIn this case the primary but\nyou understand it doesn't have to be.\n\n215\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:42.450\nKnows that it's okay to give\n10.10.8200 a copy of the zone file.\n\n216\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.330\nSo let's go back over to DC01 and\ncreate that secondary zone again.\n\n217\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.406\nNew Zone, Secondary.\n\n218\n00:10:52.398 --> 00:10:54.230\nThe zone name has to match.\n\n219\n00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.781\nIt's gonna call that other DNS server\nthe master, and say I want a copy.\n\n220\n00:10:57.781 --> 00:10:58.885\n&gt;&gt; Basically it's asking for\npermission, right?\n\n221\n00:10:58.885 --> 00:11:06.271\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going to say I\nwant a copy of DEV.IT.PROTV.\n\n222\n00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:08.860\nIf I mistype it here and\nI say, DEVLMNT.ITPRO.ITV.\n\n223\n00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.053\nBut when it calls the master and\nsays, hey,\n\n224\n00:11:11.053 --> 00:11:13.330\nI need a copy of Development.IT.ITPROTV.\n\n225\n00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Well you don't have permission.\n\n226\n00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.340\n&gt;&gt; There's no zone.\n\n227\n00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.251\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There's no zone called\n\n228\n00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:17.946\nDevelop.IT.PROTV.\n\n229\n00:11:17.946 --> 00:11:19.266\n&gt;&gt; I can't give you that.\n\n230\n00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:21.320\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, you're not gonna get anything.\n\n231\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.720\nSo let's make sure we get that right.\n\n232\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:30.235\nDev.ITPro.TV, we'll click Next,\nwho is your master?\n\n233\n00:11:30.235 --> 00:11:33.100\n10.10.8.201, I like to\n\n234\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.790\ntab out of it just to make sure\nit's at least trying to resolve it.\n\n235\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.910\nBut I got a green check mark,\nlooks good, I'll click Next and Finish.\n\n236\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:48.850\nAnd now when we click on it, it hasn't\nloaded, but that's okay, it will.\n\n237\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.440\nEventually load it up and there we go.\n\n238\n00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.030\nIt's just a little timing thing.\n\n239\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.320\nAs soon as you set it up,\ngive it a couple of seconds and\n\n240\n00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.190\nnow that it has permission\nnotice it gets a copy of it.\n\n241\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.540\nNow I can't make new records.\n\n242\n00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.950\nThere is no new option.\n\n243\n00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.640\nThey are not in my list\nbecause this is a secondary.\n\n244\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.060\nIt's a read only copy so I don't even\nhave the option to create new records.\n\n245\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.360\nBut if a new record pops in here.\n\n246\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.454\nLet's go over to the writable copy,\ntest 2,\n\n247\n00:12:16.454 --> 00:12:21.284\n10108210 not\n\n248\n00:12:21.284 --> 00:12:26.275\na 221@host and done.\n\n249\n00:12:26.275 --> 00:12:30.920\nWe are back over to DCL1,\nit could take it a minute or two.\n\n250\n00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.630\nBut there it goes, look it's already\nin there, test two has replicated over.\n\n251\n00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.180\nSo now I've got two servers\nhosting a copy of the zone.\n\n252\n00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.400\nI've got full tolerance, I've got extra\n\n253\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.950\nworkload that can be handled cuz I've got\ntwo machines that can answer queries.\n\n254\n00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.340\nBut one of them is a read only so\nif the primary goes down.\n\n255\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.050\nNo changes, no new records until\nI get the primary back up.\n\n256\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:56.040\nSo those are standard primary and\nstandard secondary zones.\n\n257\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.860\nThe third one on n\nthe list is the new one.\n\n258\n00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.570\nI say new, it's definitely not new.\n\n259\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.060\nIt's been around for quite some time.\n\n260\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.420\nBut it's known as\nActive Directory Integrated Zones.\n\n261\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.450\nWe saw that option on our wizard.\n\n262\n00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nactually thanks Doug in chat for\n\n263\n00:13:14.475 --> 00:13:17.761\nmentioning there that came in with 2000.\n\n264\n00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:21.176\nAnd it was 2003 that you might\nbe thinking of he says for\n\n265\n00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:25.940\nthe introduces the and domain DNS\nwith the directory integrated zones.\n\n266\n00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.468\n&gt;&gt; Is it really in 2000?\n\n267\n00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:29.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I started in 2000 and\n\n268\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.910\nI thought I remembered in 2003 thinking,\nthis is new.\n\n269\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.320\nThis is something cool but yeah, I\ndefinitely could be off on that year, so.\n\n270\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, just a history lesson.\n\n271\n00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.110\n&gt;&gt; It's definitely been\naround at least for 15 years.\n\n272\n00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.940\nIt's been around for a while.\n\n273\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.849\nSo when I say new I mean\nnot new at all [LAUGH].\n\n274\n00:13:47.849 --> 00:13:50.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Al right, fine.\n\n275\n00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:53.903\nBut the fancier zone type that we can\ncreate is known as an Active Directory\n\n276\n00:13:53.903 --> 00:13:55.440\nintegrated zone.\n\n277\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.990\nWe saw in the wizard that It's only\navailable if you're installing DNS\n\n278\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.660\non a domain controller.\n\n279\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.770\nBecause if you're not a domain controller\nyou don't have Active Directory.\n\n280\n00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.230\n&gt;&gt; How can I integrate it?\n\n281\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.670\nThere's nothing to integrate with, right?\n\n282\n00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\n\n283\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.960\nI mean it kinda makes sense, right?\n\n284\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.080\nOnce you think about what the name means.\n\n285\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.550\nLike, duh, and that no wonder it's grayed\nout when I'm not on a domain controller.\n\n286\n00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:21.000\n&gt;&gt; Which is also a great thing if you're\nlooking at some kind of diagram or image.\n\n287\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.860\nAnd there, maybe have something\ntestable saying, well,\n\n288\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.430\nwhy isn't this it's not working.\n\n289\n00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.790\nAnd look picking up on the subtle clues\nthere, kind of like a little indicator.\n\n290\n00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:30.970\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n291\n00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.520\nSo, when we install that directory,\nit actually created a zone for us.\n\n292\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.465\nWhen we created our domain,\nit created a new zone,\n\n293\n00:14:38.465 --> 00:14:43.820\nlab.itpro.tv, and this zone is\nan active directory integrated zone.\n\n294\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:49.050\nIf I pull up Properties and\nwe look Active Directory Integrated.\n\n295\n00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.770\nNotice I can change, we'll kind of come\nback to that concept in just a second.\n\n296\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.910\nFirst, let's understand what they\nmean by Active Directory Integrated.\n\n297\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.670\nWhen we created that primary,\nthat first one,\n\n298\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.310\nremember it created that\nfile dev.itpro.tv.dns right?\n\n299\n00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.340\nThat's a standard zone file and\n\n300\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.840\nwe could go browse to it and\nfind it on the hard drive.\n\n301\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.120\nActive domain controllers\nhave that database,\n\n302\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.148\nwe talked about that in our\nactive directory episode.\n\n303\n00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.720\nNtds.dit.\n\n304\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.040\nIt's a database.\n\n305\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:28.060\nIt actually had three partitions in it,\nand it's got application partitions.\n\n306\n00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.770\nAnd when we do an active\ndirectory-integrated zone,\n\n307\n00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.300\nwhat we're doing is\nwe're actually creating\n\n308\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.740\nan application partition to\nstore the dns information.\n\n309\n00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.795\nRather than create a separate zone file or\nactive database,\n\n310\n00:15:42.795 --> 00:15:45.870\nlike said in our previous episode.\n\n311\n00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:50.340\nLet's just use that active directory\ndatabase to store the DNS information.\n\n312\n00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.152\nDoesn't that make sense?\n\n313\n00:15:51.152 --> 00:15:54.961\nIt's already a domain controller,\nalready has that database.\n\n314\n00:15:54.961 --> 00:15:57.430\nSo that's what active\ndirectory integrator does.\n\n315\n00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.341\nI'm just gonna start storing this\ninformation With Active Directory.\n\n316\n00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:05.099\nNow, many, many advantages of,\ngosh you know what,\n\n317\n00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:10.660\nit's bugging me, I was trying to\nremember all the partitions there.\n\n318\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.371\nAnyway, we'll come back to that.\n\n319\n00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:13.392\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n320\n00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:19.690\nwhen we store that in Active Directory,\nwe get lots and lots of advantages.\n\n321\n00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:24.000\nI'm trying to think of a good\nreason to use standard primary and\n\n322\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.340\nsecondaries anymore.\n\n323\n00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.010\nAnd it's really only when\nyou need to put a DNS server\n\n324\n00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.260\nsome place that you don't\nwanna put a domain controller.\n\n325\n00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.859\nLike out in your DMZ, forward facing,\nInternet facing, something like that.\n\n326\n00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:42.514\nBut with your Active Directory integrated\nzones, we can actually choose.\n\n327\n00:16:42.514 --> 00:16:45.095\nLet's create an Active Directory\nintegrated zone, and\n\n328\n00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:48.930\nI will show you the options, and\nthen we'll kinda talk about them as we go.\n\n329\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.290\nSo, I'm gonna right click New zone,\ngonna click Next.\n\n330\n00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:56.170\n[COUGH] I'm gonna do Primary, but\nI'm gonna store it in Active Directory.\n\n331\n00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.480\nThat's what's gonna make it\nActive Directory integrated.\n\n332\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.460\nOnly if DNS Server is a writable domain\ncontroller, so if I had chose not\n\n333\n00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.760\nto install DNS on this domain controller,\nwouldn't be able to do this.\n\n334\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.200\nWouldn't be in the DNS console anyway,\nbecause DNS wouldn't be installed on here.\n\n335\n00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.935\nAnd not read-only domain controllers,\n\n336\n00:17:13.935 --> 00:17:17.950\nbecause this type of zone\nis going to be read, write.\n\n337\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:24.984\nAnd on a read-only domain controller,\n[LAUGH] wow, cannot talk today.\n\n338\n00:17:24.984 --> 00:17:28.815\nNTDS.dit is flagged as read-only,\n\n339\n00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:32.560\nso if I shove DNS information in there,\nthat's gonna be read only as well.\n\n340\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.070\nSo can't do an Active Directory integrated\non a read-only domain controller.\n\n341\n00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.240\nI'll click Next, [COUGH] and\n\n342\n00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:46.146\nhere's my choice I get to choose\nwhat the replication scope is.\n\n343\n00:17:46.146 --> 00:17:50.750\nBecause we're storing this with Active\nDirectory, I have more than one domain\n\n344\n00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.938\ncontroller, always have at least two\ndomain controller most likely many more.\n\n345\n00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:57.270\nAnd domain controllers replicate\nthat Active Directory database.\n\n346\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.570\nAgain, there's three partitions they\nreplicate slightly differently,\n\n347\n00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.035\nthere's your domain partition.\n\n348\n00:18:02.035 --> 00:18:04.960\nWhich replicates within the domain,\nthere's\n\n349\n00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.430\nthe schema partition which replicates to\nall domain controllers in the domain.\n\n350\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.620\n&gt;&gt; You've got, schema.\n\n351\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.690\nSo that was-\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n352\n00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:16.210\nit's the domain schema-\n&gt;&gt; Directory root, forest root,\n\n353\n00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.010\ndirectory partition,\nconfiguration directory partition, and-\n\n354\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.363\n&gt;&gt; The configuration partition,\n\n355\n00:18:20.363 --> 00:18:22.223\nthat was the third partition, there we go.\n\n356\n00:18:22.223 --> 00:18:26.110\nThe three main partitions, there are more\nbut the three main partitions schema,\n\n357\n00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.850\nconfiguration and domain.\n\n358\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.942\nDomain stores your domain specific\nobjects, schema stores the schema,\n\n359\n00:18:31.942 --> 00:18:34.054\nthe definition for all your objects.\n\n360\n00:18:34.054 --> 00:18:37.576\nAnd then configuration stores\nconfiguration about the forest,\n\n361\n00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:41.186\nits biology, what domain controllers\nexist, things like that.\n\n362\n00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:45.470\n[COUGH] Excuse me, when we create\nActive Directory integrated,\n\n363\n00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.422\nwe're just gonna create another partition.\n\n364\n00:18:47.422 --> 00:18:50.340\nWe're gonna say hey,\nlet's put some DNS information in here.\n\n365\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.890\nNow when we create that partition,\nwe have to scope it.\n\n366\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.380\nWe have to decide what\nother domain controllers.\n\n367\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.629\nThis is going in the Active Directory\ndatabase, which gets replicated around to\n\n368\n00:18:59.629 --> 00:19:03.629\nother domain controllers, based on\nwhether they're part of my domain, or\n\n369\n00:19:03.629 --> 00:19:05.831\njust part of the force in another domain.\n\n370\n00:19:05.831 --> 00:19:09.115\nSo, we have to decide when we create\nthis partition where does this partition\n\n371\n00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:09.910\nreplicate?\n\n372\n00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.950\nAnd our choices are to all DNS\nservers running on domain controllers\n\n373\n00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.460\nin this forest, Lab.ITPro.TV.\n\n374\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.900\nSo, what this is gonna do it's\ngonna create a forest DNS zone.\n\n375\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.220\nIt's actually called forest DNS zone, and\n\n376\n00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.840\nit will replicate all domain controllers\nin the forest, if they're running DNS.\n\n377\n00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.570\nIf they're not running DNS they\nwon't get a copy of this partition\n\n378\n00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.100\nbecause they don't need it, right?\n\n379\n00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.390\nBut any domain controller\nin the forest that's\n\n380\n00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.470\nrunning DNS will get a copy of this zone.\n\n381\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.220\nI could choose all DNS servers running\non domain controllers in this domain.\n\n382\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.640\nSo now we're gonna make\nthe domain DNS cell.\n\n383\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.820\nThis is gonna replicate to all\ndomain controllers in my domain\n\n384\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.660\nthat are running DNS, but\nnot outside of my domain.\n\n385\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.110\nThe third one is for\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n386\n00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.600\nThis replicates to all domain controllers,\nwhether they're running DNS or\n\n387\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.130\nnot, within my domain.\n\n388\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.000\nYou can see for\nWindows 2000 compatibility,\n\n389\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.440\nusually we don't have to worry\nabout that option anymore.\n\n390\n00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.000\nSo the question then becomes,\nwho needs access to the zone file?\n\n391\n00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.470\nIf this is a zone file that has resource\nrecords for something just my domain uses,\n\n392\n00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.460\nI would probably replicate to just\nthe domain controllers in my domain.\n\n393\n00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.410\nBecause domain b and c, their never gonna\nlook up any resource records in there.\n\n394\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.610\nThere's no point in wasting\nthe replication, the storage space for\n\n395\n00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.430\nincluding a copy of that zone.\n\n396\n00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.080\nBut if this zone is something that\neverybody in the forest uses,\n\n397\n00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.570\nthen I would replicate it to all\ndomain controllers in the force and\n\n398\n00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.160\nit would create that forest DNS zone,\nall right.\n\n399\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.330\nNow I'll do just in the domain,\n\n400\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.650\nonly because I don't have any\nother domains in my forest.\n\n401\n00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:45.258\nAnd we'll click Next, I'll give it a name,\n\n402\n00:20:45.258 --> 00:20:52.440\nlet's call this one marketing.ITPRO.TV,\nand we'll click Next.\n\n403\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.680\nNow, unlike when we created\nthat standard primary,\n\n404\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.650\nmy secure dynamic updates is available,\nuse only secure dynamic updates.\n\n405\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.150\nWe've talked about dynamic updates, right.\n\n406\n00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, we understand what those are,\n\n407\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.140\nthe client can call up and\ncreate his own resource record.\n\n408\n00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.360\nBut there's no security involved\nwhen you choose this option here.\n\n409\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what if I'm a bad guy and\nI wanna tell you fake information.\n\n410\n00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.530\nAnd say, hey, my information has changed.\n\n411\n00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.970\nBut I'm really speaking on behalf,\nI'm rogue and\n\n412\n00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.640\nI'm speaking on behalf\nof a legitimate client.\n\n413\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.495\n&gt;&gt; You're trying to redirect,\nspoof somebody.\n\n414\n00:21:25.495 --> 00:21:27.806\nYou're trying to say, hey,\nwhen you look up this name,\n\n415\n00:21:27.806 --> 00:21:30.760\nwhich I know you're gonna do,\nI'm gonna give you the wrong IP address.\n\n416\n00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.409\nAnd redirect you to my server where I can\ncapture all your information or yeah,\n\n417\n00:21:35.409 --> 00:21:38.870\ndo [LAUGH] whatever you want,\nevil laugh, evil laugh.\n\n418\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.700\nSecure dynamic update says hey,\nbefore your allowed to make that update\n\n419\n00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.960\nI need to know who you are,\nI need to trust you.\n\n420\n00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.330\nSo if you're part of the domain then\nyou can do your secure dynamic update.\n\n421\n00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.970\nIf your not, you don't get to\ndo a dynamic update, right.\n\n422\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.380\nThat's the idea, this prevents things\nlike what Cherokee was talking about,\n\n423\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.060\npeople making bogus records\nof rogue DNS entries.\n\n424\n00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.780\nAlso for vendors, right, what if a vendor,\na legitimate vendor comes in,\n\n425\n00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.509\nthey plug there laptop internet network.\n\n426\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.730\nThey're gonna get an IP\naddress from your DHCP server.\n\n427\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.342\nThey're gonna get a DNS IP\naddress from your DHCP server.\n\n428\n00:22:13.342 --> 00:22:17.100\nTheir laptop's gonna turn around and\ntry to register with your DNS server, and\n\n429\n00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.080\nthere's really no reason for me to have\na record like that on my DNS server.\n\n430\n00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.710\nSo it just prevents things like that\nfrom happening, and it keeps me safe.\n\n431\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.072\nThat's the main thing, right, it keeps the\nbad guys from trying to fake something.\n\n432\n00:22:29.072 --> 00:22:33.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you might even hear\nthat term, like that DNS poisoning.\n\n433\n00:22:33.725 --> 00:22:38.250\nPoisoning being like a general kind\nof alteration, not altercation.\n\n434\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.045\n&gt;&gt; That too if I find out who did it.\n\n435\n00:22:40.045 --> 00:22:46.372\nMaybe, [LAUGH] no, peace is the way to go,\nviolence is always never the answer.\n\n436\n00:22:46.372 --> 00:22:53.310\nAll right, so I'll do secured only, then\nI'll do both, nah I'll do secure only.\n\n437\n00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.310\nDecisions, decisions, we'll do the proper.\n\n438\n00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.300\n&gt;&gt; Live on the edge, Mike.\n\n439\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.969\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, and remember do not allow\n\n440\n00:22:58.969 --> 00:23:02.562\ndynamic updates if I'm in this situation\nwhere I wanna manually create all\n\n441\n00:23:02.562 --> 00:23:06.330\nthe records for security reasons,\nthen that would be the option.\n\n442\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.200\nI'll do only secure,\nI'll click Next and Finish.\n\n443\n00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.480\nAnd now we have a new zone,\nan Active Directory integrated zone.\n\n444\n00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.540\nAnd we got to see the options of where\nI was gonna allow that to replicate.\n\n445\n00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.050\nSo if I set up another domain controller,\nwhich I should do.\n\n446\n00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.520\nDo we have the, I took the,\nyou know what, we'll go ahead and install\n\n447\n00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.440\nActive Directory real fast on this guy,\nwhile we're talking about other things.\n\n448\n00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.920\nOops, if I can do it really fast.\n\n449\n00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.870\n&gt;&gt; So what you're doing is you're just\ninstalling the Active Directory so you\n\n450\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.440\ncould have a secondary or an additional\ndomain controller here, I should say.\n\n451\n00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right.\n\n452\n00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.720\n&gt;&gt; All righty.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll add features Next, Next,\n\n453\n00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.310\nNext, and Install.\n\n454\n00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.511\n&gt;&gt; Are we timing you here?\n\n455\n00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:48.605\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] see how fast we can\nget Active Directory installed.\n\n456\n00:23:48.605 --> 00:23:49.750\nWhat have we got left on the clock.\n\n457\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:50.496\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n458\n00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:54.815\nbecause what I wanna show you, and\njust in case it doesn't pop up in time,\n\n459\n00:23:54.815 --> 00:23:59.764\nIs that will automatically replicate to\nthat other domain controller cuz it's part\n\n460\n00:23:59.764 --> 00:24:03.178\nof the same domain, and\nwe chose replicate this zone to all\n\n461\n00:24:03.178 --> 00:24:06.620\nthe main controllers in this\ndomain that are running DNS.\n\n462\n00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.937\nSo as soon as I install Active Directory\nand install DNS, it will get a copy.\n\n463\n00:24:10.937 --> 00:24:14.041\nWhen Active Directory replicates,\nit will replicate and\n\n464\n00:24:14.041 --> 00:24:16.390\nI'll have two servers hosting this.\n\n465\n00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.120\nNow let's talk about the advantages\nover primary, right?\n\n466\n00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.240\nBecause in primary we've got two servers,\nwe've got a primary and a secondary.\n\n467\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.720\nSo two servers hosting the zone,\nbut one was read only,\n\n468\n00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.640\nwhich meant no changes, no updates.\n\n469\n00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.480\nI could only have one writable copy,\nthat's kind of a downer as well.\n\n470\n00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.970\nWith Active Directory Integrated\nbecause Active Directory\n\n471\n00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:41.300\nhas a built in mechanism to deal\nwith replication conflicts.\n\n472\n00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.830\nActive Directory uses what's called,\n&gt;&gt; KDC?\n\n473\n00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Well the KDC is part of it, but\n\n474\n00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:54.152\nthe concept is, Gosh,\nDoug's gonna get me with this one too.\n\n475\n00:24:54.152 --> 00:24:58.400\n[LAUGH] Man, it's been too long\nsince I've talked about this stuff.\n\n476\n00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.160\nMulti master with loose convergence.\n\n477\n00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.270\nThere we go.\n\n478\n00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.740\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you remembered that.\n\n479\n00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, uses multi master\nreplication with loose convergence.\n\n480\n00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.010\nAnd really that's a big fancy term for,\n\n481\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.680\nwhat we need to understand is more\nthan one writable copy, all right.\n\n482\n00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.352\nWell now, Mike, you told me that\nif I have two writable copies,\n\n483\n00:25:15.352 --> 00:25:17.149\nwe can end up with replication conflicts.\n\n484\n00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:19.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; What if two changes are being made\n\n485\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.520\nat the same time on two\ndifferent machines?\n\n486\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.145\nWhat are we doing with replicate?\n[CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; It wins, yeah.\n\n487\n00:25:23.145 --> 00:25:25.395\n&gt;&gt; Well Active Directory has\nways of dealing with this,\n\n488\n00:25:25.395 --> 00:25:27.560\nwe won't go over them in this class.\n\n489\n00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.950\nThere's three different things that\nit can do with replication conflicts.\n\n490\n00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.090\nThe point is,\nit has a mechanism to deal with conflicts.\n\n491\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.700\nSo now that we're putting DNS\nin there with Active Directory,\n\n492\n00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.170\nwe have a way of dealing with conflicts,\nright?\n\n493\n00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.130\nSo now I can have more\nthan one writable copy.\n\n494\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.740\nSo Active Directory integrated zones,\nthey're all writable.\n\n495\n00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.610\nIt's multi-master, there is no one master.\n\n496\n00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.410\nThere's no secondary to set up.\n\n497\n00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.560\nSo if I have three dominion controllers,\nfive dominion controllers,\n\n498\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.365\nI have five writable copies of the zone.\n\n499\n00:25:56.365 --> 00:25:57.417\n[CROSSTALK] Exactly.\n\n500\n00:25:57.417 --> 00:26:00.853\nAnd if one of them goes down,\nI can still make changes,\n\n501\n00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:05.140\nI can still create new records,\neverything goes on as normal.\n\n502\n00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.820\nSo big advantage over primary and\n\n503\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.730\nsecondary, is the fact that I\nhave more than one writable copy.\n\n504\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.170\nSecond big advantage,\nis the secure only dynamic updates.\n\n505\n00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.360\nI can't do that with standard\nprimaries and secondaries, so\n\n506\n00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.520\nthat's a big security bonus there, being\nable to verify the identity before we\n\n507\n00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:27.200\nallow them to create those\nresource records in DNS.\n\n508\n00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.000\nThird big advantage, when that primary and\n\n509\n00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.860\nsecondary DNS server replicate that\nzone file, when the secondary says hey,\n\n510\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.960\ngive me copy of your zone file and\nthe master says sure, here you go.\n\n511\n00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.530\nIt travels across the network, it's\nnot encrypted, it's plain text, right?\n\n512\n00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.592\nThere is no built-in encryption method for\nDNS,\n\n513\n00:26:45.592 --> 00:26:50.590\nit has no way to do it\non its own like this.\n\n514\n00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.460\nSo what can happen is, if somebody's on\nyour network running a pack of capture\n\n515\n00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.590\nutilities like Wireshark or\nMessage Analyzer from Microsoft or\n\n516\n00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.120\nsomething like that,\nthey can capture that data and\n\n517\n00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.990\nread your zone file just like\nthey got a zone transfer.\n\n518\n00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.700\nSo we would have to use maybe IPsec or\nsomething like that\n\n519\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.390\nto encrypt the communication\nbetween that primary and secondary.\n\n520\n00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:16.090\nActive directory replication\nis encrypted already, right?\n\n521\n00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:18.630\nActive Directory encrypts\nthat replication traffic.\n\n522\n00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.060\nSo once we put DNS in there and it's now\nreplicating the DNS zone to that other\n\n523\n00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.800\ndomain controller, it's encrypted also.\n\n524\n00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.700\n&gt;&gt; So it sounds like it's a pretty sweet\ndeal if we can actually take advantage of\n\n525\n00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.670\nthese enhancements that\nActive Directory has to offer.\n\n526\n00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.410\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nreplication topology is another one.\n\n527\n00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:38.889\nYou mentioned I think the the KCC or-\n&gt;&gt; Knowledge Consistency Checker, yep.\n\n528\n00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:41.820\n&gt;&gt; The Knowledge Consistency Checker and\nthe Intersite Typology Generator,\n\n529\n00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.430\nthese are engines that define or\n\n530\n00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.410\nthat develop our replication between\ndomain controllers and they do a very good\n\n531\n00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:53.250\njob of making sure that there's a minimum\nnumber of hops between domain controllers.\n\n532\n00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:57.780\nAnd with standard, primary, and secondary,\nwe're doing that on our own, right?\n\n533\n00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.480\nI said we should make the primary the\ncenter of the spoke and maybe do, or hub,\n\n534\n00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.780\nand then makes spokes going\nout to the secondaries.\n\n535\n00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.310\nBut I could do a chain, and\nthat's not real efficient.\n\n536\n00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.380\nWith Active Directory Integrated, we're\ntaking advantage of the KCC and the ISTG,\n\n537\n00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.560\nand we know we already have\nan efficient replication topology.\n\n538\n00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.960\nSo we just piggyback on top of that.\n\n539\n00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:23.230\nSo yes, as you were saying,\nit's a win-win-win-win situation, right?\n\n540\n00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:28.790\nI mean I get secure updates, encrypted\nreplication, efficient replication\n\n541\n00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:33.800\ntopology, the replication is encrypted,\nI have multiple writable copies.\n\n542\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.009\nI forgot a WIN there, so\nthat's five wins, right?\n\n543\n00:28:36.009 --> 00:28:38.503\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It really is and that's why I say,\n\n544\n00:28:38.503 --> 00:28:42.129\nActive Directory Integrated is\nreally what you're going to see,\n\n545\n00:28:42.129 --> 00:28:46.678\nunless you need to install DNS somewhere\nwhere you can not put a domain controller.\n\n546\n00:28:46.678 --> 00:28:52.090\nAnd that's definitely something that\nwe have to do, but internally you're\n\n547\n00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:57.788\nalmost always, I think, going to see\nActive Directory Integrated into zones.\n\n548\n00:28:57.788 --> 00:29:01.670\nYou know I started talking and\nI never did finish my wizard, did I?\n\n549\n00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.664\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we still have things\nlike stump zones to talk about.\n\n550\n00:29:04.664 --> 00:29:05.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.\n\n551\n00:29:05.278 --> 00:29:08.660\n&gt;&gt; Also really there's no need to rush\nbecause I mean we're going to have to have\n\n552\n00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.650\npart three here [LAUGH].\n\n553\n00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.832\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n554\n00:29:11.832 --> 00:29:14.380\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike, so\nhopefully you'll come back and join us for\n\n555\n00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.180\nthis wonderful part three that we have and\nhopefully you'll join us as well but for\n\n556\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.990\nnow we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n557\n00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.362\nI’ve been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n558\n00:29:21.362 --> 00:29:22.142\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n559\n00:29:22.142 --> 00:29:25.565\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV\n\n560\n00:29:25.565 --> 00:29:31.513\n[MUSIC]\n\n561\n00:29:31.513 --> 00:29:33.560\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:07.961\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.788\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your 70-410 series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.520\nHere we are out of part three,\nwe're continuing talking about DNS.\n\n7\n00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.196\nSpecifically looking how to go ahead and\nconfigure it and\n\n8\n00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:25.102\nmaybe even a little bit of that history.\n\n9\n00:00:25.102 --> 00:00:29.349\nAnd some clarification on some of those\ncomponents that you may have already seen\n\n10\n00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.330\nin the previous two episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.140\nAnd of course, back with us today in\nstudios, we have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.886\nThank you for joining us today Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:38.428\nYou're welcome Cherokee and\nthanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:38.428 --> 00:00:39.264\nAnd, yeah, we're good.\n\n15\n00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:40.053\nI had to come back, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:41.249\nWe gotta finish up this DNS.\n\n17\n00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Of course.\n\n18\n00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:46.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No actually, I'm very glad\nto be here, I love talking about DNS.\n\n19\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.944\nSo when we left off in that part two,\nright?\n\n20\n00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:49.721\nCuz this is part three?\n\n21\n00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:50.299\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n22\n00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.156\n&gt;&gt; We were installing Active Directory\non a second member server And\n\n23\n00:00:55.156 --> 00:01:00.500\nthat's gonna include DNS by default,\nI didn't change anything.\n\n24\n00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.930\nSo it finished, and let's just take\na look and see what we've got.\n\n25\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.650\nI am on server 2 or I'm sorry server 1\nwhich is my second domain controller.\n\n26\n00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.630\nI can see Active Directory has\nbeen installed, as well as DNS.\n\n27\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.100\nAnd we are gonna open up the DNS console.\n\n28\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.120\nAnd what we'll find when we open\nthat folder to look up zones.\n\n29\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.145\nRemember in part one I think,\n\n30\n00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:23.100\nwe had created a standard\nprimary on this machine.\n\n31\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.820\nThen I promoted it to a domain controller,\nchose DNS,\n\n32\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.960\nit saw it was already installed and\nI was fine with that.\n\n33\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.890\nIf I look though,\nthere is LAB.ITPRO.TV right?\n\n34\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.080\nBecause that was an Active Directory\nintegrated zone on DC01,\n\n35\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.799\nnow that server wants to domain\ncontrolled, it automatically gets a copy.\n\n36\n00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.852\nBecause we chose the option replicate to\nall the main controllers that are running\n\n37\n00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:47.670\nDNS in the domain.\n\n38\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.190\nSame thing for marketing right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.180\nWe just made that one,\nthat was not automatically created.\n\n40\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.140\nWe made it on DC01 and\n\n41\n00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.940\nnow Serv1 has a copy of it because again,\nit's Active Directory integrated.\n\n42\n00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.560\nWe still have DEV.ITPRO.TV which we made\nbefore we installed Active Directory.\n\n43\n00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.220\nThis is a standard primary zone, so it's\nnot in the Active Directory database, but\n\n44\n00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.420\nI can still manage it\nhere through my console.\n\n45\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.707\nSo the point of this is two fold.\n\n46\n00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:17.271\nOne, we see that the replication\nActive Directory application is\n\n47\n00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:20.290\ntaking care of replicating DNS for me.\n\n48\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.505\nSo I don't have a separate\ntopology to maintain,\n\n49\n00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:24.130\ntroubleshoot or anything like that.\n\n50\n00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.190\nI got a single replication topology, takes\ncare of both Active Directory and DNS.\n\n51\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.110\nSecond thing we'll see is I can have both,\nI could have three really,\n\n52\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.097\nI could have Active Directory\nintegrated zones, standard primary and\n\n53\n00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:38.705\nsecondary zones and stuff.\n\n54\n00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:42.220\nWe could actually have four types\nof zones on one DNS server.\n\n55\n00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.500\nSo don't think your DNS server,\n\n56\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.880\nif it's a domain controller, can only\ndo Active Directory integrated zones.\n\n57\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.530\nYou can still chose to create a zone.\n\n58\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.250\nMaybe it's for a test or a dev environment\nthat you don't want replicating to\n\n59\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.820\nany other domain controllers, right?\n\n60\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.980\nYou don't need the replication traffic,\nthe workload.\n\n61\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.900\nIt's just for you for testing or\nyour little dev team.\n\n62\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.400\nSo maybe you make a standard primary zone\nlike I've done here for DEV.ITPRO.TV and\n\n63\n00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.020\nyou don't replicate it anywhere, right?\n\n64\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.140\nThey don't need the fall tolerance.\n\n65\n00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.440\nHeck, if it goes down,\nthey're still writing code,\n\n66\n00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.400\nthey don't need the DNS every minute of\nthe day maybe or something like that.\n\n67\n00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.650\nOr maybe you do set up fault\ntolerance like I did, and\n\n68\n00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.800\ncreate a secondary on some other server,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.000\nSo just a couple things we\nwant to point out there.\n\n70\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.630\nAll right, so we've looked at\nthe different types of zones.\n\n71\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.250\nThe only one we haven't done is sub zones.\n\n72\n00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.335\nWe're gonna save that for the very end.\n\n73\n00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:35.290\nWe're gonna talk about a few other\nbasic concepts here before we move on.\n\n74\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.650\nSo when we talk about DNS, we've already\nsaid that DNS resolves fully qualified\n\n75\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.750\ndomain names into IP addresses, and that's\na forward look up zone or forward look up.\n\n76\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.850\nIt could also do IP address back\nto name which is a reverse lookup.\n\n77\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.390\nThe questions, when we formulate, when I\ntype in www.newegg.com into my browser.\n\n78\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.810\nWhat my DNS client on my machine\nis doing is, formulating a query,\n\n79\n00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.430\na query is just a question\nthat is sending over the DNS.\n\n80\n00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.150\nHey, what is the IP\naddress of www.newegg.com?\n\n81\n00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.900\nWhat is the IP address\nof serverone.itpro.tv?\n\n82\n00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.720\nOr whatever the case maybe.\n\n83\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.433\nSo queries are what we\nsend to the DNS server,\n\n84\n00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:24.137\nthat's the official name for\nthose questions, right?\n\n85\n00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:29.310\nSo far we've really been looking\nat a very simple DNS solution.\n\n86\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.014\nI've got some drawings that I wanna try\nto use here if I can find the right one.\n\n87\n00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:35.810\nI think it's this one.\n\n88\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.590\nThat is not the one I want.\n\n89\n00:04:40.627 --> 00:04:41.338\nSure, save my changes.\n\n90\n00:04:41.338 --> 00:04:45.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We hope they were good changes.\n\n91\n00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.026\nSo we'll drag in,\njust taking a sweet time here,\n\n92\n00:04:49.026 --> 00:04:50.441\nwe're gonna get this\nopen in just a second.\n\n93\n00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:55.496\nAnd we'll take a look at and that is\nthe same, darn what, are you kidding me?\n\n94\n00:04:55.496 --> 00:04:57.875\nUnderstanding DNS.\n\n95\n00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:02.478\n&gt;&gt; So what we'll be looking\nat is different types of\n\n96\n00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:06.645\nqueries that we may be asking or\nexpecting.\n\n97\n00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:09.615\nWhat kind of results we're gonna see\nfrom those different types of queries.\n\n98\n00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:10.315\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n99\n00:05:10.315 --> 00:05:12.982\nSo I'm gonna move that out of the way,\nand here we go.\n\n100\n00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:16.102\nSo, we're gonna start and\nwe will talk about in turns, right?\n\n101\n00:05:16.102 --> 00:05:19.054\nSo, we've set up DNS for ITPro.TV.\n\n102\n00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:22.492\nWhere you see me do it here, create\na little zone to host those records.\n\n103\n00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:25.861\nThat's what organizations do,\ninstall Active Directory, you install DNS,\n\n104\n00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:27.017\nyou create your zone file,\n\n105\n00:05:27.017 --> 00:05:30.151\nyou create automatically if you\nare doing Active Directory integrated.\n\n106\n00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:34.616\nAnd now all your machines can all register\ntheir names and IP addresses, and\n\n107\n00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:36.670\nyou can resolve those names.\n\n108\n00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.430\nSo if I wanna connect to another\nresource on the network,\n\n109\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.580\nI can simply send a query\nover to my DNS server.\n\n110\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.753\nWhat's the IP address\nof server01.itpro.tv?\n\n111\n00:05:44.753 --> 00:05:48.020\nIt can look it up in the zone file.\n\n112\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.820\nIt's authoritative.\n\n113\n00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.310\nIt has the zone file for ITProTV.\n\n114\n00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.952\nAnd it can send me the answer back, and\nthen I can connect to that DNS server.\n\n115\n00:05:54.952 --> 00:05:58.250\nAnd that's all well and good.\n\n116\n00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.930\nOther organizations\nare doing the same thing.\n\n117\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.580\nMicrosoft has their DNS servers that\nhave a zone file for Microsoft.com and\n\n118\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.680\nit has all the records of all the machines\nthat belonged in there namespace.\n\n119\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.050\nNewegg has a DNS server with\na zone file that has all their\n\n120\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.700\nnamed IP address mappings, right?\n\n121\n00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.240\nSo each organization resolves\nthat has their own DNS server.\n\n122\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.414\n&gt;&gt; Right or really just defining\nthat responsibility because I mean,\n\n123\n00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:25.804\nit would be crazy to think that every\nsingle IP address was cataloged and\n\n124\n00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:28.532\nindexed in one particular system, right?\n\n125\n00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:30.650\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly right.\n\n126\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.870\nAnd that's where we\nwanna go next is okay?.\n\n127\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.690\nSo I can resolve names internally, but\n\n128\n00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.640\nwhat about when my user types in\nnewegg.com, or www.microsoft.com?\n\n129\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.410\nIf we send that query to our DNS server,\nhe's gonna look at his own files and\n\n130\n00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.990\ngo, I don't have a zone for\nnames that end in Microsoft.com.\n\n131\n00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.729\nI don't know what that IP address is.\n\n132\n00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:50.587\n&gt;&gt; I only know ITProTV.\n\n133\n00:06:50.587 --> 00:06:51.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's all it knows.\n\n134\n00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.929\n&gt;&gt; LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n135\n00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:56.580\nhow do we resolve those external names?\n\n136\n00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.820\nThat's when we have to start looking\nat the bigger picture for DNS.\n\n137\n00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.240\nDNS is what we call a distributed\nhigher article database and\n\n138\n00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.800\nthat just means that it's not a single\ndatabase but it's distributed,\n\n139\n00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.720\nit's broken off against many,\nmany machines.\n\n140\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.710\nAnd it's higher article,\nit has a order to it, right?\n\n141\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.774\nAnd that's what we have to\nunderstand next, right?\n\n142\n00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:24.890\nSo see if I can get this all to\nfit on my screen there we go.\n\n143\n00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:29.021\nAll right, so here we are again,\nhere is that same little area ITProTV.\n\n144\n00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:32.260\nWe've got our DNS server,\nwe've got our clients.\n\n145\n00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.900\nBut now my clients typed\nin www.microsoft.com.\n\n146\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.624\nSo, what DNS server Cherokee has\nthe resource records we need to find,\n\n147\n00:07:39.624 --> 00:07:43.215\nif I am looking for\na name that's end in microsoft.com.\n\n148\n00:07:43.215 --> 00:07:46.470\n&gt;&gt; Then Microsoft DNS server\nthe one that's authoritative for\n\n149\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.880\nthat particular domain.\n\n150\n00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.148\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that's where I need to\nsend my queries over their DNS server.\n\n151\n00:07:53.148 --> 00:07:56.901\nThe problem is my client,\nif he looks at his TPIP settings,\n\n152\n00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:00.877\nit tells him who to use for DNS and\nit's our local DNS server, so\n\n153\n00:08:00.877 --> 00:08:04.049\nwe can resolve names,\nlogin, things like that.\n\n154\n00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:09.027\nSo when I send that query to my local DNS\nserver, my local DNS server now has to go,\n\n155\n00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:13.201\nI don't know that name, but\nhe's gonna try to figure it out for me,\n\n156\n00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.344\nhe's not gonna leave me hanging.\n\n157\n00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:16.953\nIt's gonna say, you know what?\n\n158\n00:08:16.953 --> 00:08:20.346\nI don't know that, I'm not\nauthoritative for microsoft.com, but\n\n159\n00:08:20.346 --> 00:08:22.024\nlet me see if I can find out for you.\n\n160\n00:08:22.024 --> 00:08:27.488\nAnd what he really needs to do,\nis talk to the microsoft.com DNS server.\n\n161\n00:08:27.488 --> 00:08:31.658\nThe problem is,\nhow do we find Microsoft's DNS server?\n\n162\n00:08:31.658 --> 00:08:33.484\nOr Contoso's DNS server?\n\n163\n00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:35.291\nOr newegg's DNS server?\n\n164\n00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:38.058\nOr whomever it is that you\nuser is trying to connect to.\n\n165\n00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:42.071\nHow does my DNS server find the\nauthoritative server for that namespace?\n\n166\n00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:45.475\nAnd ask it,\ndo you have a computer name www?\n\n167\n00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:47.367\nIf so what's its IP address?\n\n168\n00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:52.239\nAll right, so that's where we started\nlooking at this bigger picture and\n\n169\n00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:56.953\nwe see that there's many components\nto DNS that work together to give us\n\n170\n00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.407\nthe ability to resolve these names.\n\n171\n00:08:59.407 --> 00:09:00.937\nCuz if we stuck with this,\n\n172\n00:09:00.937 --> 00:09:03.749\nall I'd ever be able to resolve-\n&gt;&gt; You wouldn't be able to leave your\n\n173\n00:09:03.749 --> 00:09:04.314\nlittle bubble there.\n\n174\n00:09:04.314 --> 00:09:07.211\n&gt;&gt; That's it,\nall I get is one little area, and\n\n175\n00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:10.578\nI don't go much further\nwithout a lot of extra work.\n\n176\n00:09:10.578 --> 00:09:13.444\nSo here's what we do.\n\n177\n00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:16.812\nEach company, Microsoft already has\na DNS server, I just need to find it.\n\n178\n00:09:16.812 --> 00:09:17.920\nSo how do I find it?\n\n179\n00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.462\nWell, we're gonna start at\nthe top of the hierarchy, right?\n\n180\n00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:25.107\nWe go up to the very top,\nand we work our way down.\n\n181\n00:09:25.107 --> 00:09:27.144\nAnd Cherokee brought up\na great point a minute ago.\n\n182\n00:09:27.144 --> 00:09:32.369\nLet's circle back around and make sure\nthat we've reinforced that concept.\n\n183\n00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:37.004\nThere is no one DNS server\nthat knows everything, right?\n\n184\n00:09:37.004 --> 00:09:42.081\nThere's no one big database that has\nevery single name and IP address in it.\n\n185\n00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:45.188\nIt would be too big,\nit would be unmanageable,\n\n186\n00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:48.463\nit wouldn't be very\nefficient to look things up.\n\n187\n00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:51.941\nThink about phone books,\nthey make a great analogy for DNS.\n\n188\n00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:55.822\nWhat if you had one phone book for\nthe entire world?\n\n189\n00:09:55.822 --> 00:09:56.849\nOne, I couldn't pick it up.\n\n190\n00:09:56.849 --> 00:09:57.579\n&gt;&gt; How many pages?\n\n191\n00:09:57.579 --> 00:09:59.531\nYeah, like you'd be\nsifting through all those.\n\n192\n00:09:59.531 --> 00:10:02.960\n&gt;&gt; And even if it was on a big table,\nand I could flip the monster pages over,\n\n193\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.884\nand I didn't have to carry it anywhere.\n\n194\n00:10:04.884 --> 00:10:07.175\nHow long would it take me to\nget through the Ss, right?\n\n195\n00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:08.373\nTo get to the Ts or whatever.\n\n196\n00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:09.748\nI mean, it just would not work.\n\n197\n00:10:09.748 --> 00:10:12.385\nSo we break it up into smaller chunks,\nright?\n\n198\n00:10:12.385 --> 00:10:15.860\nHeck, in the United States, we don't even\ndo it by state because a Florida phone\n\n199\n00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.200\nbook would be too big, right?\n\n200\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.718\n&gt;&gt; Too much, yeah.\n\n201\n00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:19.718\n&gt;&gt; We have even smaller ones.\n\n202\n00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:23.328\nYou go down to Tampa, and I think they've\nbroken Tampa up into several smaller\n\n203\n00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:25.365\nchunks from the looks\nof these phone books.\n\n204\n00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:26.584\n&gt;&gt; You mean people still use phone books?\n\n205\n00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:27.372\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n206\n00:10:27.372 --> 00:10:27.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:29.233\n&gt;&gt; You guys know what a phonebook is?\n\n208\n00:10:29.233 --> 00:10:33.638\n[LAUGH] All right, so yeah I do\nprobably need to update my analogy,\n\n209\n00:10:33.638 --> 00:10:37.817\nI just thought of that, wow, or\nyou just reminded me of that.\n\n210\n00:10:37.817 --> 00:10:39.670\nSo a phonebook is a paper document.\n\n211\n00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.008\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n212\n00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:47.916\nthere's no one server that knows\neverything, it would just be unwieldy.\n\n213\n00:10:47.916 --> 00:10:51.561\nNot to mention it could end up being\na single point of failure, right?\n\n214\n00:10:51.561 --> 00:10:55.319\nOf course, we'd have more than one,\nhopefully, blah, blah, blah, but\n\n215\n00:10:55.319 --> 00:10:57.752\nit wouldn't be good, so\nwe break it up, right?\n\n216\n00:10:57.752 --> 00:11:03.030\nAnd I say we, I mean IETF, the IANA,\nthe people that come up with these.\n\n217\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:08.211\nWe break it up by namespace.\n\n218\n00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:11.655\nSo when you think about DNS names, right?\n\n219\n00:11:11.655 --> 00:11:14.630\nThere's what we call\nthe overall namespace,\n\n220\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.453\nevery name you can possibly\nhave out there on the Internet.\n\n221\n00:11:18.453 --> 00:11:19.592\nAnd then we break it up.\n\n222\n00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:23.212\nAnd you guys are familiar with this,\neven though you might not know the terms.\n\n223\n00:11:23.212 --> 00:11:26.883\nBut we have what's called\nTop-Level Domains, or TLDs.\n\n224\n00:11:26.883 --> 00:11:33.242\nAnd these are like .com,\n.gov, .net, .tv, .biz, .me.\n\n225\n00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:37.553\nI mean they're adding new ones all\nthe time, it seems like, right?\n\n226\n00:11:37.553 --> 00:11:39.381\nSo we're gonna break it up that way.\n\n227\n00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:43.431\nOr let's go back one more before\nwe get to the top levels.\n\n228\n00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:47.639\nThere's what's known as the root,\nat the very top of the DNS infrastructure.\n\n229\n00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.214\n&gt;&gt; Tippy-top.\n\n230\n00:11:48.214 --> 00:11:50.068\n&gt;&gt; Yes, think of it like a pyramid, right?\n\n231\n00:11:50.068 --> 00:11:53.228\nAt the very top,\nis what's known as the root.\n\n232\n00:11:53.228 --> 00:11:54.825\n&gt;&gt; Which if you're looking,\n\n233\n00:11:54.825 --> 00:11:59.488\nthinking about it in that fully qualified\ndomain format which you referenced.\n\n234\n00:11:59.488 --> 00:12:04.760\nA lot of people might not even recognize\nthe little period there that actually\n\n235\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.721\nexists but we don't type it in,\nwe don't type them like seethen.com.\n\n236\n00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:12.143\n&gt;&gt; Well, we don't because-\n&gt;&gt; But that's the root, the whole dot.\n\n237\n00:12:12.143 --> 00:12:15.109\n&gt;&gt; It is, and\ntechnically it is supposed to be there.\n\n238\n00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:19.343\nBut most of our browsers\nunderstand that if we take a look.\n\n239\n00:12:19.343 --> 00:12:24.101\nLet me see if it shows me in here and I\nsee it hides it from me there as well but\n\n240\n00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:25.989\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n241\n00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:28.409\nThe root is presented by a period.\n\n242\n00:12:28.409 --> 00:12:34.470\nSo technically my fully qualified\ndomain name is dagaba.ITPRO.TV.,\n\n243\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.530\nthere is a dot at the end.\n\n244\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:41.314\nTo represent the end, or the top,\nit can go no further to the right.\n\n245\n00:12:41.314 --> 00:12:43.149\nIt can go out to the left if we need to.\n\n246\n00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:45.146\nBut we cannot go past that last dot.\n\n247\n00:12:45.146 --> 00:12:47.309\nThat is the root, that is the very top.\n\n248\n00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:51.875\nSo you will see root sometimes written\nlike that, quote, period, quote, right?\n\n249\n00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:55.016\nBecause that represents the top\nof the DNS infrastructure.\n\n250\n00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:58.521\nSo he's the very top but,\nagain, he can't hold everything,\n\n251\n00:12:58.521 --> 00:13:00.252\nthere's just too many names.\n\n252\n00:13:00.252 --> 00:13:03.073\nSo what we did, we took the root and\nwe said, all right,\n\n253\n00:13:03.073 --> 00:13:05.972\ninstead of you having everything,\nlet's divide it up.\n\n254\n00:13:05.972 --> 00:13:08.812\nAnd let's divide it up\nby the top level domain,\n\n255\n00:13:08.812 --> 00:13:12.292\nthe next to the last part in\nfully qualified domain names.\n\n256\n00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:16.150\n.Gov, .biz, .tv, .edu,\nall those wonderful extensions.\n\n257\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.350\n.party I think they have now,\n.me, all kinds of good stuff.\n\n258\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.138\n&gt;&gt; I know, and the .tv,\nI forget the Tuvalu for the country.\n\n259\n00:13:23.138 --> 00:13:23.992\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n260\n00:13:23.992 --> 00:13:26.750\nwe're actually supporting\nthat particular country.\n\n261\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.899\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n&gt;&gt; By keeping their domain,\n\n262\n00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:28.878\nI thought that was pretty cool.\n\n263\n00:13:28.878 --> 00:13:31.354\n&gt;&gt; It is kinda neat, and\nthere's a whole story behind that, right?\n\n264\n00:13:31.354 --> 00:13:33.798\nBecause they can,\nI mean that's their country code.\n\n265\n00:13:33.798 --> 00:13:36.281\nIt's not TV for television like\nwe think of here in the US.\n\n266\n00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:37.073\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n267\n00:13:37.073 --> 00:13:38.586\n&gt;&gt; It's actually a country.\n\n268\n00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:43.398\nBut they will allow people to register\nnames using their designated top\n\n269\n00:13:43.398 --> 00:13:45.733\nlevel domain for a price, right?\n\n270\n00:13:45.733 --> 00:13:49.168\nSo they're making money off the fact that\npeople want .tv at the end of the name.\n\n271\n00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:52.857\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just like .ai that the other day\nand I thought yeah that's gonna start\n\n272\n00:13:52.857 --> 00:13:55.944\nbecoming more popular,\nwe might like create a whole new .com.\n\n273\n00:13:55.944 --> 00:13:57.606\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, .ai, .all.\n\n274\n00:13:57.606 --> 00:13:58.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.848\n&gt;&gt; I don't know. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Anywho, but\n\n276\n00:13:59.848 --> 00:14:03.280\nit is really cool, and I can see how\nyou get so excited talking about this.\n\n277\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:03.976\n&gt;&gt; It is fantastic.\n\n278\n00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.818\n&gt;&gt; Because even looking at the roots\n\n279\n00:14:05.818 --> 00:14:10.350\nthere, and we have our A through M,\nthere are 13 of them, and there are, well,\n\n280\n00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.119\nof course there are mirrors.\nBut you see entities like NASA,\n\n281\n00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:19.940\ndifferent universities, military entities,\nthey all come together to help manage and\n\n282\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:25.003\nmaintain this, to keep this international\nstructure in place and healthy.\n\n283\n00:14:25.003 --> 00:14:26.446\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's really cool and\n\n284\n00:14:26.446 --> 00:14:30.714\nas another great point you make, there's\nnot just one server hosting the root,\n\n285\n00:14:30.714 --> 00:14:34.909\nright?\nThere are 13 entities, if you will, but\n\n286\n00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:39.888\neach one of those 13 is actually\na distributed farm with\n\n287\n00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:44.720\nservers around the world.\nSo it's not like there's only 13 servers\n\n288\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.603\nsitting up there running the entire thing.\nBut yes, in the end, there are 13 entities\n\n289\n00:14:50.603 --> 00:14:55.121\nthat manage these root servers, right?\nSo we divide it up, we'll say root,\n\n290\n00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:57.745\nthat's okay, you can't handle it all.\nLet's divide it up into those\n\n291\n00:14:57.745 --> 00:15:00.026\ndifferent top level domains,\nand that's what I have here.\n\n292\n00:15:00.026 --> 00:15:03.592\nThere are publicly maintained TLD servers.\n\n293\n00:15:03.592 --> 00:15:04.587\nAnd this .com server,\n\n294\n00:15:04.587 --> 00:15:07.867\nI know that's really small.\nLet me zoom in, even though we can't see\n\n295\n00:15:07.867 --> 00:15:10.511\nthe whole picture.\nOops, don't move the cloud, Mike.\n\n296\n00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:12.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What's up with your cloud on\n\n297\n00:15:12.844 --> 00:15:15.633\nthe side anyways, over there, Mike?\n\n298\n00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:18.195\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nit's something to do with simple diagrams,\n\n299\n00:15:18.195 --> 00:15:20.922\nit just has this one broad stroke for\nthat one piece of the cloud.\n\n300\n00:15:20.922 --> 00:15:22.034\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's very strange.\n\n301\n00:15:22.034 --> 00:15:23.486\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And every cloud has that.\n\n302\n00:15:23.486 --> 00:15:24.987\nYou guys don't see that when\nyou look up at the sky?\n\n303\n00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:26.492\nEvery cloud has a dark stroke on one side.\n\n304\n00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.644\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n305\n00:15:27.644 --> 00:15:29.248\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n306\n00:15:29.248 --> 00:15:34.307\nwe're gonna divide these names up into the\nappropriate TLD, so there's a .com server.\n\n307\n00:15:34.307 --> 00:15:37.573\nSo imagine taking all those names and\nthen saying hey look,\n\n308\n00:15:37.573 --> 00:15:40.920\nany name that ends in .com,\nlet this guy handle it, right?\n\n309\n00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.205\nPut it in his database.\n\n310\n00:15:42.205 --> 00:15:45.288\nIf the name ends in .gov,\nthis guy can handle it, right?\n\n311\n00:15:45.288 --> 00:15:48.026\nSo now we've taken that big name space,\nand\n\n312\n00:15:48.026 --> 00:15:51.809\ndivided it up into a little\nmore manageable chunks, right?\n\n313\n00:15:51.809 --> 00:15:54.175\nBut even then, we don't stop there.\n\n314\n00:15:54.175 --> 00:15:59.475\nThe .com server does not know about\nevery single name that ends in .com.\n\n315\n00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:01.035\nWhat he does know is,\n\n316\n00:16:01.035 --> 00:16:06.603\nThe different servers that manage\n.com namespaces like microsoft.com.\n\n317\n00:16:06.603 --> 00:16:10.580\nThe .com services,\nI can find microsoft.com.\n\n318\n00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.950\nI can find newegg.com.\n\n319\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.880\nI know about amazon.com.\n\n320\n00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.410\nIf their name ends in .com,\nI know the IP address of their DNS server.\n\n321\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.810\nNot every single computer\nin their network.\n\n322\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.340\nBut I can find their\nauthority to DNS server.\n\n323\n00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.870\nSame thing for .Net.\n\n324\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:29.460\nHe knows about all DNS servers\nthat handled names .N and .Net.\n\n325\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.970\nSo if you're trying to look up local\ngov.net, this guy can tell you who\n\n326\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.350\nthe authoritative server is for\nlocal gov.net, all right.\n\n327\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.690\nSo that's how they break that up.\n\n328\n00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.910\nAnd then you're responsible for\nrunning your own.\n\n329\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.890\nIf you've registered a .com name,\n\n330\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.710\nthen you've maintained your own\nDNS server from microsoft.com.\n\n331\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:52.951\nOr like we do here, we maintain a DNS\nserver, we actually pay somebody to do it,\n\n332\n00:16:52.951 --> 00:16:58.541\nlike GoDaddy or Amazon or something like\nthat, but we maintain itpro.tv, right?\n\n333\n00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:03.598\nThat's on our responsibility, and\nthat's why the Internet can grow, and\n\n334\n00:17:03.598 --> 00:17:09.590\nwe can add so many names everyday, and\nthese guys up here don't get overwhelmed.\n\n335\n00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:10.340\nBecause they're not,\n\n336\n00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.720\nif you add a new organization,\nlet's say I come up with company xyz.com.\n\n337\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.668\nAnd we're gonna start it up and\nwe've got 500,000 nodes, right?\n\n338\n00:17:19.668 --> 00:17:23.643\nThis guy doesn't get 500,000\nnew .com resource records,\n\n339\n00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:27.540\nit gets one new resource record\nthat points to my DNS server.\n\n340\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.710\nAnd then my DNS server has to handle\nthe 500,000 resource records for\n\n341\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.830\nall the clients, right?\n\n342\n00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.340\nSo they're not getting that much\nmore when we start adding companies.\n\n343\n00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.080\nAnd they have huge amounts of nodes,\nor all these changes occur.\n\n344\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.543\nSo we split it up into this\nhierarchical structure?\n\n345\n00:17:43.543 --> 00:17:48.532\nAll right, so now that we understand how\nit's split up, and I'm trying to zoom, so\n\n346\n00:17:48.532 --> 00:17:50.521\nI can kinda see everything here.\n\n347\n00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:54.010\nNow that we see how it's split up,\nlet's see how this process works.\n\n348\n00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.236\nActually, before I do that, I've gotta\nexplain to you recursive and iterative,\n\n349\n00:17:58.236 --> 00:17:59.900\nbecause we need to see\nhow those work as well.\n\n350\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.320\nYou'll notice how have two different\ncolored arrows on my screen.\n\n351\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.930\nWhen we create queries, there's two\ndifferent kinds of queries we can send.\n\n352\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.900\nThere's a recursive query and\nthere's an iterative query.\n\n353\n00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.760\nA recursive query requires an answer.\n\n354\n00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.300\nIn other words,\nI'm gonna ask you a question,\n\n355\n00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.840\nDNS server, and I'm gonna sit here and\nwait, until you give me the answer.\n\n356\n00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.130\nIt might not be the answer I want.\n\n357\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.500\nIt might be a name not found,\nor something like that.\n\n358\n00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.220\nBut I'm not doing anything\nuntil you respond to me.\n\n359\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.120\nI'm asking you a question,\nyou have to respond to me.\n\n360\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.400\nThat's a recursive query.\n\n361\n00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.625\nAnd remember it this way,\nI don't know why it sticks in my brain,\n\n362\n00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:39.221\nrecursive requires an answer.\n\n363\n00:18:39.221 --> 00:18:40.419\n&gt;&gt; That's a good way to-\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n364\n00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:40.999\n&gt;&gt; Think about it.\n\n365\n00:18:40.999 --> 00:18:41.998\n&gt;&gt; Recursive requires an answer.\n\n366\n00:18:41.998 --> 00:18:46.490\nIf you can remember that, then you'll\nknow the other one has to be iterative.\n\n367\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:52.870\nIterative queries can either\naccept an answer or a referral.\n\n368\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.210\nSo instead of me telling you the answer\nto the question you're asking, I can say,\n\n369\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.080\nI don't know, but go check with this guy,\nmaybe he knows, right?\n\n370\n00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.720\nThat's an iterative query.\n\n371\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.620\nIterative queries can\neither take an answer or\n\n372\n00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.170\na referral to somebody\nelse that I can ask.\n\n373\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.960\nSo now we can a look at\nwhat's going on here.\n\n374\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.524\nWhen your client sends a query\nto the local DNS server,\n\n375\n00:19:14.524 --> 00:19:16.940\nwhat's the IP address for\nwww.microsoft.com?\n\n376\n00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.156\nMaybe they've typed that in their\nbrowser and they hit go, right?\n\n377\n00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:22.760\nSo this is all happening\nbehind the scenes.\n\n378\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.630\nTheir client generates a recursive\nquery that requires an answer.\n\n379\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.808\nSends it to the local DNS server, or\n\n380\n00:19:28.808 --> 00:19:33.170\nwhatever their TCP IP settings\nsay to use for DNS, all right?\n\n381\n00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.540\nBecause my client doesn't want the answer.\n\n382\n00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.420\nHey, I don't know,\ngo check somewhere else, buddy.\n\n383\n00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.200\nI'm too busy for you.\n\n384\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.430\nOr I don't know, go try this guy.\n\n385\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.200\nThe client needs the answer,\nmy browser needs to open microsoft.com, so\n\n386\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.920\nreferrals not gonna do me any good.\n\n387\n00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.383\nSo it sends a recursive query,\nsays go find out for me, and\n\n388\n00:19:49.383 --> 00:19:51.236\ndon't come back until you do.\n\n389\n00:19:51.236 --> 00:19:54.811\nThis is going to be step number one,\nall right?\n\n390\n00:19:54.811 --> 00:19:58.299\nThen my DNS server gets that query,\nand says, you know,\n\n391\n00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:03.720\nI'm not authoritative for microsoft.com so\nI don't have the information.\n\n392\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.900\nBut you sent me a recursive query telling\nme I better go get the information, so\n\n393\n00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.570\nthat's what I'm going to do.\n\n394\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.040\nSo he goes out, and\nhe actually sends a query\n\n395\n00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.170\nto the very top of the DNS infrastructure,\nto the root, the very top.\n\n396\n00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.250\nAnd notice this query is blue,\nit is iterative.\n\n397\n00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.160\nGive me the answer, or\nrefer me to somebody else.\n\n398\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.270\nAnd he sends that query up to the root.\n\n399\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.372\nThe root says,\nI don't know who www.microsoft.com is,\n\n400\n00:20:29.372 --> 00:20:32.816\nI'm the root,\nI don't know silly little details\n\n401\n00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:35.339\nlike that, but-\n&gt;&gt; I do know that .com\n\n402\n00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:36.073\nguy\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n403\n00:20:36.073 --> 00:20:40.700\nhe says I recognize the end of your name,\nit ends in a .com.\n\n404\n00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.720\nI know the guy that\nhandles the .com names.\n\n405\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.643\nWhy don't you go check with him?\n\n406\n00:20:43.643 --> 00:20:47.602\nAnd he sends back a referral, right?\n\n407\n00:20:47.602 --> 00:20:50.250\nStep three coming back this way.\n\n408\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.490\nBack to my DNS server,\nmy arrow is missing the ends of it there,\n\n409\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.220\nbut there's an arrow coming back this way.\n\n410\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.630\nSends it back and says, hey,\n\n411\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.560\nI don't know the IP address but here's\nthe IP address of the .com TLD server.\n\n412\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.180\nWhy don't you go check with him since\nthe name you're looking for ends in .com?\n\n413\n00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.680\nMy DNS server says, thank you, and\nhe sends a query, an iterative query.\n\n414\n00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.470\nAnswer or referral to the .com\nname space server, and says,\n\n415\n00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.620\nhey, do you now, www.microsoft.com?\n\n416\n00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.320\nAnd he says, no, no, I don't.\n\n417\n00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.880\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; Is that the voice he makes?\n\n418\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.402\n&gt;&gt; He does.\n\n419\n00:21:23.402 --> 00:21:24.703\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's really strange.\n\n420\n00:21:24.703 --> 00:21:27.942\nThe dot-com guys got this little gruffly\nvoice, not like the dot-net guys,\n\n421\n00:21:27.942 --> 00:21:30.510\nthis little girl, I don't know,\nshe sounds a little young.\n\n422\n00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:35.239\nNo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n423\n00:21:35.239 --> 00:21:37.445\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's like me saying,\n\n424\n00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:41.776\ncollision on a network sounds like [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:21:41.776 --> 00:21:42.891\n&gt;&gt; Analogies and stuff.\n\n426\n00:21:42.891 --> 00:21:44.714\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have to do this sometimes.\n\n427\n00:21:44.714 --> 00:21:45.236\n&gt;&gt; We have to have fun.\n\n428\n00:21:45.236 --> 00:21:45.737\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n429\n00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:48.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this .com server says, I don't know.\n\n430\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.540\nWhy don't you go check?\n\n431\n00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.700\nI do know who the authoritative\nserver is for microsoft.com.\n\n432\n00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.060\nI don't know their\nindividual IP addresses, but\n\n433\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.980\nI know the IP address of\ntheir authoritative server.\n\n434\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.610\nWhy don't you go check with him?\n\n435\n00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.650\nAnd since we've hacked the IP address for\nMicrosoft's DNS server.\n\n436\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.840\nSo then my DNS server says,\nokay, well, thank you very much.\n\n437\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.804\nDown the rabbit hole we go.\n\n438\n00:22:09.804 --> 00:22:13.861\nAnd he sends over a query to\nthe Microsoft DNS server, and says,\n\n439\n00:22:13.861 --> 00:22:18.190\nhey, buddy, do you know the IP address for\nwww.microsoft.com?\n\n440\n00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.480\nMicrosoft's DNS server says,\nI'm authoritative from microsoft.com.\n\n441\n00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.278\nI can look at up for you.\n\n442\n00:22:23.278 --> 00:22:24.487\n&gt;&gt; I'm your man or woman.\n\n443\n00:22:24.487 --> 00:22:25.777\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm your man or your woman.\n\n444\n00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:29.441\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he says here is the IP address for\n\n445\n00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:31.540\nwww.microsoft.com.\n\n446\n00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.690\nMy DNS server finally gets the answer\nto the question that it was asked and\n\n447\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.510\nthen can respond back to my client.\n\n448\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.270\nWith the appropriate IP address and\nmy browser magically opens up and\n\n449\n00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:48.340\nsays, hey, here is www.microsoft.com.\n\n450\n00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.210\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n451\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.094\nI think this is one of\nthe things I love about DNS.\n\n452\n00:22:50.094 --> 00:22:52.897\n&gt;&gt; I know and we're looking\nat all these steps, but just,\n\n453\n00:22:52.897 --> 00:22:55.415\nthere's a lot going on but\nit happens so quickly.\n\n454\n00:22:55.415 --> 00:22:59.441\nAnd something that we also want to keep in\nmind, is that this process only happens if\n\n455\n00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:01.857\nwe didn't have that already\nstored in our cache,\n\n456\n00:23:01.857 --> 00:23:04.640\nbecause we're always going\nto be checking there first.\n\n457\n00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.600\nSo we may not go through all of\nthese steps every single time.\n\n458\n00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.120\n&gt;&gt; She's giving up my secrets,\nis what she's doing.\n\n459\n00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.850\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n460\n00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.510\n&gt;&gt; I just wanted to make\nsure we didn't forget that.\n\n461\n00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.970\n&gt;&gt; We haven't talked about that yet.\n\n462\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes, there's definitely.\n\n463\n00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.591\nLet's just pretend we don't\nknow about cache yet.\n\n464\n00:23:18.591 --> 00:23:19.368\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n465\n00:23:19.368 --> 00:23:21.539\n&gt;&gt; This happens every\ntime you go to a site.\n\n466\n00:23:21.539 --> 00:23:23.805\nSo but we know it doesn't now.\n\n467\n00:23:23.805 --> 00:23:25.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's not fair.\n\n468\n00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.044\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, Mike.\n\n469\n00:23:26.044 --> 00:23:29.462\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is the process that\noccurs when we resolve names, and\n\n470\n00:23:29.462 --> 00:23:31.373\nit's pretty magical if you ask me.\n\n471\n00:23:31.373 --> 00:23:34.392\nIt's a pretty impressive process.\n\n472\n00:23:34.392 --> 00:23:36.471\nAnd go to a site you've\nnever been to before,\n\n473\n00:23:36.471 --> 00:23:39.380\nthat you know nobody else on\nyour network has been to.\n\n474\n00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.599\nType in, I dunno, australia.gov, right?\n\n475\n00:23:41.599 --> 00:23:44.820\nNot to say that many people don't go\nto this site, it's a wonderful site.\n\n476\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.280\nBut what are the odds of\nmy co-workers going there?\n\n477\n00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.020\nSo I can type that into my browser.\n\n478\n00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.590\nAnd connect to it like that.\n\n479\n00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.390\nAnd all of this is happening, right?\n\n480\n00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.690\nAll of these queries,\nthese recursive queries,\n\n481\n00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.330\nthese iterative queries, are going on\nin the background making that happen.\n\n482\n00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.645\nSo its, it's really a fantastic thing.\n\n483\n00:24:03.645 --> 00:24:04.908\nAll right?\nAnd you can imagine,\n\n484\n00:24:04.908 --> 00:24:06.009\nI won't redo the drawing.\n\n485\n00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:10.687\nBut if the name I had originally\nrequested Requested ended in .Net.\n\n486\n00:24:10.687 --> 00:24:13.570\nThe process would've just been modified,\nI would've sent the query to the route.\n\n487\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:17.320\nThe route would've said, hey I don't know,\nbut the name you're looking for\n\n488\n00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.770\nends in .Net, go check with the .Net TLD,\n\n489\n00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:26.120\ntop level domain DNS server and then\nthe process would've continued on, right?\n\n490\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.242\nSo big things we're learning here\nare that there are two types of queries.\n\n491\n00:24:31.242 --> 00:24:35.160\nThere is recursive queries that require an\nanswer, iterative queries that can accept\n\n492\n00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.550\nan answer or\na referral through another DNS server.\n\n493\n00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.450\nThe fact that MyDNS server\ndoesn't know everything, and\n\n494\n00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.220\nthere really is no DNS server\nthat knows everything.\n\n495\n00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.575\nWe use a combination, this hierarchical\nstructure works together to give us\n\n496\n00:24:50.575 --> 00:24:55.700\nthe scalability and\nthe performance we need to make DNS work.\n\n497\n00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.950\nTo support the ever expanding internet,\n\n498\n00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.880\nI mean if you didn't have this the\ninternet would not be what it is today.\n\n499\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.293\nYou know, if we are relying on some\nsystems that didn't work this way,\n\n500\n00:25:06.293 --> 00:25:10.140\nit just would not work, so\nfantastic stuff, all right.\n\n501\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.590\n&gt;&gt; Mike, are there any shortcuts\nto help with this process.\n\n502\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.650\nIf I were maybe merging, ITPro.TV and\nMicrosoft were merging or\n\n503\n00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.846\nsomething like that and I was expecting\nan influx of those types of requests.\n\n504\n00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:23.497\n&gt;&gt; There are, but\nI'm looking at the clock and\n\n505\n00:25:23.497 --> 00:25:25.470\nI know you're gonna give\nme that signal in a second.\n\n506\n00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.994\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That,\n\n507\n00:25:26.994 --> 00:25:31.040\nMike you've talked too much again and\nwe're gonna have to stop you.\n\n508\n00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.800\nSo I think what I'll do is I'll\njump over to caching real quick.\n\n509\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.735\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Since we hinted at that already.\n\n510\n00:25:35.735 --> 00:25:37.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'll save those other stuff,\n\n511\n00:25:37.482 --> 00:25:39.550\ncuz they're gonna take a few more\nminutes than what we've got.\n\n512\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n513\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.878\nI just had to remember which\ndrawing l had the caching on,\n\n514\n00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:48.780\nI didn't, did l make changes?\n\n515\n00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.210\nI did make changes to it.\n\n516\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.590\n&gt;&gt; You were just moving the numbers so-\n&gt;&gt; I was just moving the numbers.\n\n517\n00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.840\nAnd we don't want the numbers\nto save there do we.\n\n518\n00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.280\nYes we wanna quit.\n\n519\n00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:03.360\nAll right, understanding part one,\nlet's see here.\n\n520\n00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.930\nSo caching, what Cherokee was talking\nabout, that's the sa- I keep doing that,\n\n521\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.690\nopening up the same darn drawings two.\n\n522\n00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.430\nLet's try number two.\n\n523\n00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.510\nRemember that I'm on two Cherokee,\nhelp me out.\n\n524\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.873\n&gt;&gt; Magic, okay, all right.\n\n525\n00:26:15.496 --> 00:26:16.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, caching.\n\n526\n00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.030\nNo, not caching.\n\n527\n00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.880\nSo number three has time,\nthird time is a charm.\n\n528\n00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.760\nSo what Cherokee was referring to\nearlier is there actually is a way\n\n529\n00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.000\nto speed things a little bit, right?\n\n530\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.660\nBecause if, that's still a very\nfast process, like I said, if you\n\n531\n00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.000\ngo to some place you've never been before,\nand that nobody else has been before,\n\n532\n00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.330\nyou'll most likely see that\nit's really pretty quick.\n\n533\n00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:42.750\nIt's almost imperceivable\nhow fast it goes, right?\n\n534\n00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.135\nBut there are days when the traffic is\nbad and it takes a little bit longer and\n\n535\n00:26:47.135 --> 00:26:50.476\nwe get the spinning Cherry-O\nas it resolves that name and\n\n536\n00:26:50.476 --> 00:26:53.066\ntries to reach out\nan http get that website.\n\n537\n00:26:53.066 --> 00:26:58.340\nBut DNS has something called caching and\nall DNS servers cache,\n\n538\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:05.620\nwell, unless you tell them not to, and\neven your clients cache DNS information.\n\n539\n00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.380\nCache is spelled C-A-C-H-E, so\nnot like the cash in your wallet.\n\n540\n00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.345\nBut just like the cash-\n&gt;&gt; Although it is temporary.\n\n541\n00:27:13.345 --> 00:27:14.180\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just like the cash\n\n542\n00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.160\nin your wallet it is very temporary,\nright?\n\n543\n00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.130\nSo when you think of cache,\nthink temporary storage,\n\n544\n00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.080\ntemporary memory things like that.\n\n545\n00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.130\nSo DNS caches responses, and\n\n546\n00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:31.160\nthat way if I get asked the same question\nagain, I don't have to go look it up.\n\n547\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.390\nI already have the answer, I just\nlooked up the IP address for User A.\n\n548\n00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.490\nDo you really want me to\ngo look it up again for\n\n549\n00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.850\nUser B that was 10 seconds ago, right?\n\n550\n00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.100\nHas the IP address really\nchanged in 10 seconds.\n\n551\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.270\nOdds are probably good that it hasn't, so\n\n552\n00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.795\nI can use that cached information,\nthat's known as caching.\n\n553\n00:27:48.795 --> 00:27:53.360\nAnd the process here, if we look at this\ndrawing, we've got a client1, let's just\n\n554\n00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.600\nsay, types in Microsoft.com in his\nbrowser, goes through the normal process,\n\n555\n00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.190\nsends a recursive, I'm sorry a, yeah\na recursive query to the local DNS server.\n\n556\n00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.450\nI simplified the steps to just show you\nthese two, right, but it does the root and\n\n557\n00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:12.320\nthen the .com and then microsoft.com,\nfinally gets the answer.\n\n558\n00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.360\nBefore it gives the answer\nback to the client,\n\n559\n00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.220\nit writes the answer down in temporary\nstorage, in cache, all right?\n\n560\n00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.880\nThen it gives the answer to the client.\n\n561\n00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.180\nThe client actually caches it as well.\n\n562\n00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.280\nSo that if I close my browser accidentally\nor intentionally, and then I open it up\n\n563\n00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.620\nagain, I wanna go back to microsoft.com,\nI don't even have to do these two steps.\n\n564\n00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.820\nI already have the IP addressed cashed,\nso I can just go straight to it.\n\n565\n00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.210\nBut how it speeds up name\nresolution is that if a second user\n\n566\n00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:45.020\nwants to go to microsoft.com they don't\nknow that I have been to microsoft.com.\n\n567\n00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.830\nThey send a query over to DNS, DNS says\nwait a second, I just looked that up,\n\n568\n00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.860\nhold on a second.\n\n569\n00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.170\nAnd he pulls it out of the cache and\nsends it back to the client.\n\n570\n00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:57.160\nClient has no idea, and cache is the\nresponse that it gets from the DNS server,\n\n571\n00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.190\nit doesn't know that it\ncame from his cache.\n\n572\n00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:04.280\nBut he skipped all of these steps, right?\n\n573\n00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.260\nSo that whole process, and I can't open\nup two drawings at the same time, sorry.\n\n574\n00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:13.070\nYeah, so the only thing that's going on\nnow is, one query gets sent to the DNS\n\n575\n00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:16.430\nserver, he has the answer in the cache,\nand he sends it right back to him.\n\n576\n00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:22.180\nAnd we get to skip all those other steps,\nwhich is definitely gonna save us time.\n\n577\n00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.240\nNow, there is a downside to caching,\nbecause things change,\n\n578\n00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.990\nIP addresses change.\n\n579\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.220\nAnd that's why we call it cache,\nor that's why we use cache,\n\n580\n00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.630\nwe don't store those answers permanently.\n\n581\n00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:34.310\n&gt;&gt; Forever.\n\n582\n00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.410\n&gt;&gt; Because if we kept them forever,\n\n583\n00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.030\neventually that information might be\nbad and I don't wanna use it anymore.\n\n584\n00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.170\nBut, I'm never gonna go look it up again.\n\n585\n00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.890\nIt's like your friends number changed, but\nyou don't know because you've got their\n\n586\n00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.220\nnumber in your contacts, and you keep\ncalling them and they never answer.\n\n587\n00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.960\nAnd eventually you get some strange\nperson go, who the heck is this?\n\n588\n00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.485\nWhere is Bob?\n\n589\n00:29:53.485 --> 00:29:55.951\nAnd they go,\nthis isn't Bob's number anymore, right?\n\n590\n00:29:55.951 --> 00:29:59.986\nIt's that kind of thing and so we\neventually need to flush that cash out and\n\n591\n00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:01.496\nit does it automatically.\n\n592\n00:30:01.496 --> 00:30:06.033\nUses something as a TTL or time to live,\nthat determines how long their cache for\n\n593\n00:30:06.033 --> 00:30:10.590\nas a whole another conversation which we\ndon't really have time for right now.\n\n594\n00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:15.140\nSo we'll, when we get into advanced DNS,\nwe'll look at ways of managing that cache.\n\n595\n00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.880\nI'm going to talk about flushing cache,\ncuz that is important.\n\n596\n00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.190\nBut as far as who sets the TTL,\nthat'd be the authoritator server.\n\n597\n00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.270\nWhether I should change it or not, and\n\n598\n00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.650\na lot of other things we'll\nget into in the advanced DNS.\n\n599\n00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.300\nBut for now, that's what caching is.\n\n600\n00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.000\nAnd it definitely speeds the process up.\n\n601\n00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.780\nThink about your ISP, think about\nhow many customers your ISP handles.\n\n602\n00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:40.850\nAnd now what are the odds that some other\ncustomer, I use Cox Communications here.\n\n603\n00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.540\nWhat are the odds that some\nother user in this region\n\n604\n00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.610\nhas gone to Newegg.com before me.\n\n605\n00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.150\nProbably pretty good, they probably have\na pretty big cache of all the people that\n\n606\n00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.500\nare browsing the internet.\n\n607\n00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.270\nThey've got a lot of IP addresses cached.\n\n608\n00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:58.300\nSo when I go, I typically don't even\nhave to go through all those steps.\n\n609\n00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.890\nMy ISP's DNS server already\nhas that information cached.\n\n610\n00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.860\nSo, caching definitely\nspeeds up the process.\n\n611\n00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.320\nWe'll talk a little bit more about\nother ways we can speed up this process\n\n612\n00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.920\nin the next part.\n\n613\n00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthat brings us up to a part four, so\n\n614\n00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.570\nyou definitely don't wanna miss that.\n\n615\n00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.420\nThank you so much for being with us today.\n\n616\n00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.670\nAnd I thank you Mike as always, but\nwe'll go ahead and sign out for this show.\n\n617\n00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.120\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n618\n00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:26.850\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n619\n00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.694\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n620\n00:31:29.694 --> 00:31:35.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n621\n00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.783\n&gt;&gt;

series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.220\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.946\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at, well, how to configure DNS.\n\n8\n00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:26.207\nWe've already seen how to set it up and\nback with us today in studios, we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.207 --> 00:00:27.040\nMike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.120\nThanks for joining us today, Mike.\n\n11\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.640\nHow's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.580\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.510\nThanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.400\nAnd yep, excited to continue on with one\nof our favorite topics good old DNS.\n\n15\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.280\nAnd I think we talked a little bit about\nit, Cherokee, in that last episode or\n\n16\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.240\none of our previous episodes\nwe had talked about caching.\n\n17\n00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.160\nOr the concept of caching and I'm sorry,\nthat's where we're gonna start today\n\n18\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.866\nis looking at caching, and the settings,\nand really what it's all about.\n\n19\n00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.545\nAnd I think we had talked\nabout it a little bit,\n\n20\n00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:55.100\nabout how caching can\nspeed up the process.\n\n21\n00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did a little bit.\n\n22\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.860\nSo are you gonna explain how that works\nand what we need to know about caching?\n\n23\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.050\nI mean, that makes sense, right?\n\n24\n00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.572\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n25\n00:01:02.572 --> 00:01:04.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let us talk about.\n\n26\n00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.110\nWe said when we resolve queries.\n\n27\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.170\nWhen we query a DNS server,\nwe're asking yet\n\n28\n00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.860\na question whether that's a client OS or\na server OS, right?\n\n29\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.670\nIt's a DNS client sending a query\nto a DNS server saying hey,\n\n30\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.722\nwhat is the IP address of whatever,\nwww.newegg.com or microsoft.com.\n\n31\n00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:26.521\nAnd that DNS server goes through\na process to resolve that query,\n\n32\n00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.390\nto answer that question.\n\n33\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.250\nAnd we said, if the server was\nauthoritative in other words,\n\n34\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.350\nif it is Microsoft's DNS server,\n\n35\n00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.480\nit can look in its own file,\nwe can pull that answer up and return it.\n\n36\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.130\nBut if it is not authoritative,\n\n37\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.050\nit does not have that zone\nlike my local server here.\n\n38\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.180\nDoesn't have a zone for microsoft.com.\n\n39\n00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.408\nIt can go through the process,\nthe root and then the .com tld.\n\n40\n00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:52.190\nAnd eventually,\nfind its way to the Microsoft DNS server,\n\n41\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.100\nthe authoritative DNS server.\n\n42\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.880\nGet the response it wants, and\n\n43\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.840\nthen return the response to\nthe originator of that query.\n\n44\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.730\nWe said that DNS server will\ncache that response, right?\n\n45\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.372\nAnd that way if somebody\nelse asks the same question,\n\n46\n00:02:07.372 --> 00:02:09.838\nit doesn't have to go\nthrough those hoops again,\n\n47\n00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:13.852\nit doesn't have to go through the root,\nand the top level, and all the way down.\n\n48\n00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.073\nIt can just pull the answer\nof out its cache say hey,\n\n49\n00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:19.260\nhere I just got that answer 30\nseconds ago for somebody else.\n\n50\n00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.814\nHere's the answer I gave them;\nit should work for you, right?\n\n51\n00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:24.000\nThat's what we mean by caching.\n\n52\n00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.510\nWe'll also have to remember that the DNS\nclient that's running on the node will\n\n53\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.160\nalso cache the response.\n\n54\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.060\nAnd once the server gives out\nthe answer that it was asking for,\n\n55\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.570\nit keeps track of that answer and\nsaves it.\n\n56\n00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.030\nSo in that way,\nit doesn't have to ask again.\n\n57\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.400\nAnd that is something I don't think we've\nmentioned about caching the other day.\n\n58\n00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.210\nThe server caches it and\ncan respond more quickly to DNS clients.\n\n59\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.810\nBut the DNS clients also cache it which\nmeans, the next time they go to that site,\n\n60\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.460\nif they still have that\ninformation cached,\n\n61\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.590\nthey don't even have to generate a query.\n\n62\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.320\nRight, now we're talking\nabout instant response.\n\n63\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.470\nBecause I didn't have to ask anybody, I\nalready had the answer stored in my cache.\n\n64\n00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.480\nSo there really are a couple of different\ncaches that we're gonna be dealing with.\n\n65\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.230\nThere's the DNS client cache\nwhich is the DNS client.\n\n66\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.390\nWhen it gets the responses,\nit'll cache it.\n\n67\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.520\nAnd then there's the DNS server cache,\n\n68\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.990\nwhere queries that it's responded to,\nit remembers the answer or\n\n69\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.500\ncaches the answers that it can\nrespond quickly to other queries.\n\n70\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.490\nHere's where it get s a little bit twisty.\n\n71\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.040\nRight, when we're talking\nabout a DNS server.\n\n72\n00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.002\nWe have both caches.\n\n73\n00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.707\nRight, [LAUGH] that's where it\ngets some [INAUDIBLE] wait, what?\n\n74\n00:03:32.707 --> 00:03:34.679\nBecause if you think about this,\n\n75\n00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:39.360\nthe DNS server is a service running\non a Windows 2012 R2 server, right?\n\n76\n00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.040\n&gt;&gt; And it's also its own self\nthat uses DNS too, right?\n\n77\n00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.875\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's still a Windows operating\nsystem that you might log in to, right?\n\n78\n00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.820\nThe computer has to find the domain\ncontroller so that you can authenticate.\n\n79\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.520\nSo it queries DNS,\njust like any other windows machine.\n\n80\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.630\nSo it has a DNS client running\non it that's responding.\n\n81\n00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.010\nIt can't cheat and say, hey, I'm a DNS\nserver, I can just look at it myself.\n\n82\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.480\nAlthough, that's really what it does,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.410\nBut it actually sends a query to itself,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.630\nThe DNS client will just generate a query,\nsend it to itself.\n\n85\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.656\nTypically, the TCPIP settings on a DNS\nserver would point to itself for\n\n86\n00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:20.856\nDNS, 127001 or colon, colon, one.\n\n87\n00:04:20.856 --> 00:04:23.778\nBut it actually has two\nseparate components there.\n\n88\n00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:25.290\nAnd that's gonna play a role,\n\n89\n00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.990\nwe need to understand that\nwhen we talk about this cache.\n\n90\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.650\nI'll show you what I mean here in just\na second, cuz it can trip us up when we're\n\n91\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.814\ntrying to troubleshoot, try to figure out\nwhy we're getting bad responses from DNS.\n\n92\n00:04:36.814 --> 00:04:39.884\n&gt;&gt; So caches pretty awesome Mike,\n\n93\n00:04:39.884 --> 00:04:43.920\nbeing able to enhance and\nspeed things up, but are there\n\n94\n00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.640\nany caveats that I might need to think\nabout while maintaining that information?\n\n95\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, we're gonna talk\nabout a couple of reasons or\n\n96\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.900\nthings we might have to\ndo with that cache, so\n\n97\n00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.460\nlet's start by just taking\na look at the cache themselves.\n\n98\n00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.820\nSo I am on, where am I, I'm on my\ndomain controller, no I'm on serv01,\n\n99\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.550\nso let's switch machines here.\n\n100\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.050\nDc01 is also running DNS, and I'm gonna\nstart by just opening up a command prompt\n\n101\n00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.560\nand I'm gonna type in\nipconfig /DisplayDNS, right?\n\n102\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.320\nIpconfig /DisplayDNS, and\nwhat I end up getting is my cache.\n\n103\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.420\nIt's gonna show me my DNS client cache,\nnot the server cache, all right?\n\n104\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.940\nAnd these are places that it has\nresolved or had to go to recently,\n\n105\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.090\nthere's not too many in here, right?\n\n106\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.690\nIf I ping something,\nlet's make it resolve something.\n\n107\n00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.800\nLet's ping google.com.\n\n108\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.980\nWell, we know clients can only\nconnect to numbers IP addresses.\n\n109\n00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.780\nThey can't connect to names, so the first\nit did was turn that name into an IP\n\n110\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.540\naddress, and\nthen pinged it which means it used DNS.\n\n111\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.390\nIf we take a look at me cache\nagain ipconfig display DNS,\n\n112\n00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.010\nI should see,\nin fact I see several, all right?\n\n113\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.916\nSeveral responses where Google now\nin my cache, names and IP addresses.\n\n114\n00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:11.094\nAnd that's because Google has several\nservers to handle the work load that\n\n115\n00:06:11.094 --> 00:06:14.020\nthey're under, so I get several responses.\n\n116\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.440\nBut now that is cached, and so\n\n117\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.730\nif I go to Google again,\nI won't have to do a query anymore.\n\n118\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.798\nI can pull the answer right\nfrom the cache, right?\n\n119\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.420\nIf we're gonna use PowerShell,\n\n120\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.790\nbecause that is the administration\ntool of choice nowadays.\n\n121\n00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.290\nSo we need to be familiar\nwith these commands.\n\n122\n00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.661\nThey will ask you on the exam.\n\n123\n00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:38.100\nI mean maybe not this specific one,\nbut do study your PowerShell.\n\n124\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.110\nIt's get-DNS client cache.\n\n125\n00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.485\nAnd that should do the same thing.\n\n126\n00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:46.180\nFormat's a little bit different, right?\n\n127\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.810\nThe layout of the way it\nprints it out by default.\n\n128\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.655\nThis Cmdlet uses a format table or a FL or\nFT sorry format table as its result.\n\n129\n00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Normal table, yeah.\n\n130\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.700\n&gt;&gt; We could do it as\na list if we wanted to.\n\n131\n00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.130\nI don't think the results would\nlook all that pretty right?\n\n132\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.230\nlet's try it.\n\n133\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.930\nIf we do a format list.\n\n134\n00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.170\nYeah, there it looks more like what we get\nwith the cmd just by doing a format list.\n\n135\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.160\nBut the default is format table.\n\n136\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.480\nAnyway, so two different commands.\n\n137\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.500\nWe can use one for the command line,\none from the PowerShell to look at my DNS\n\n138\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.970\nclient cache, all right?\n\n139\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.770\nNow these guys are cached according\nto what's known as the TTL or\n\n140\n00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.140\nthe time to live.\n\n141\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.340\nThat's how long I'm allowed\nto cache this record, right?\n\n142\n00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.690\nAnd we talked about this,\nI think but let's go over it again,\n\n143\n00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.930\njust in case we didn't.\n\n144\n00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.110\nWe don't wanna cache things forever,\nright?\n\n145\n00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.444\nCache is temporary, and\nthe reason is things change, right?\n\n146\n00:07:40.444 --> 00:07:44.776\nIt's a very dynamic world, and we wanna\nmake sure that we got the most current and\n\n147\n00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:46.060\ncorrect information.\n\n148\n00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.129\nAnd if I hold onto this information too\nlong it's becoming stale, outdated, and\n\n149\n00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:56.216\nthere's a good chance that it could be\ninaccurate at some point as things change.\n\n150\n00:07:56.216 --> 00:08:00.696\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you mentioned something about\nwe don't ever want to have that record\n\n151\n00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:02.000\nbeing maintained.\n\n152\n00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.730\nAnd it just reminded me of\na particular situation.\n\n153\n00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.250\nYears ago I was helping someone\ntroubleshoot their network.\n\n154\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.090\nThey were running a business\nout of their home, and\n\n155\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.730\nthey had actually incorrectly registered\ntheir domain name with that registrar.\n\n156\n00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.154\nSo in order to make their network work,\nI had to use the host file and\n\n157\n00:08:20.154 --> 00:08:22.405\nmodify that permanently.\n\n158\n00:08:22.405 --> 00:08:27.049\nSo that is one way that it's going to\nbe overwriting this process, right?\n\n159\n00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:29.352\nSo we really don't want to be\nmessing with that and using it.\n\n160\n00:08:29.352 --> 00:08:33.937\nThere is not really many practical\nscenarios that have a place here with our\n\n161\n00:08:33.937 --> 00:08:37.008\nhost files in today's day and age, right?\n\n162\n00:08:37.008 --> 00:08:38.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we haven't really\ntalked about the host file, but\n\n163\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.560\nit is a static text file\nlocated on your machine.\n\n164\n00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.220\nSQL and Windows system 32 drivers, etsy.\n\n165\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.035\nAnd it is how we used to resolve\nnames really before DNS was around.\n\n166\n00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:52.970\nYou talked about ARPA.NET the other\nday in one of our episodes.\n\n167\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:58.020\nAnd back then, with so few nodes,\nI could have a text file\n\n168\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.450\nthat had all the names and IP addresses\nthat I needed to connect to, right?\n\n169\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.950\nIt was pretty easy to maintain.\n\n170\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.680\nThe problem with a static file\nlike that is they're individual.\n\n171\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.040\nSo if I have 500 nodes, I have to have,\n\n172\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.960\neach one has it's own\ncopy of the host file.\n\n173\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.800\n&gt;&gt; You typed it in.\n\n174\n00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nif I need to change something,\n\n175\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.770\nI've got to update all 500 of those.\n\n176\n00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.670\nAnd there might be a way\ntry to automate this.\n\n177\n00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.290\nBut there's no way to point a computer\nto a shared location for the host file.\n\n178\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.120\nSo it is a very manual process.\n\n179\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.690\nAnd any typos would cause problems,\nobviously,\n\n180\n00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.610\nso it was really not a good way to go.\n\n181\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.770\nI've actually used it at my house.\n\n182\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.340\nBecause I'm not running a DNS server,\n\n183\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.790\nI wasn't at the time running\na DNS server at my house.\n\n184\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:44.330\nAnd I could put entries in my host file\nto connect from my laptop sitting on\n\n185\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.845\nthe couch to the computer\nin my office by name.\n\n186\n00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:49.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nI thought you were going to say you\n\n187\n00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.620\nwere playing a joke on someone.\n\n188\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.460\n&gt;&gt; And that's another fun thing\nto do with the host file.\n\n189\n00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.250\nBut let's get back to cache.\n\n190\n00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.595\nSo cache, again,\nwe're gonna save those answers,\n\n191\n00:09:59.595 --> 00:10:04.516\nand we can see that information\nhere using either IP Config,\n\n192\n00:10:04.516 --> 00:10:09.700\nDisplay DNS, or\nGet-DNS Client Cache from PowerShell.\n\n193\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.190\nAnd again,\nthey're cached according to the TTL.\n\n194\n00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.190\nSo as I can look at these,\nin fact, it might be easier.\n\n195\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.920\nLet's see if I can see it here.\n\n196\n00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.900\nSo let's look.\nSome of these Google responses, right?\n\n197\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.097\nThis one had a TTL,\ntime to live, of 284, right?\n\n198\n00:10:24.097 --> 00:10:26.840\nBut we've been talking for\nquite a while since I ran that command.\n\n199\n00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.340\nSo I'm gonna run that command again.\n\n200\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.400\nAnd look, we just made it.\n\n201\n00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.650\nIt's down to 13 seconds.\n\n202\n00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.510\nSo if we sit here and talk, and\nwe can run it again, right?\n\n203\n00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.950\nIt's down to five seconds.\n\n204\n00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.000\nThree.\n\n205\n00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.640\nTwo.\n\n206\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.640\n&gt;&gt; Go.\n&gt;&gt; One.\n\n207\n00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.370\nAnd look, now they're gone.\n\n208\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.800\nI do an ipconfig display dns, and that\ninformation is completely gone, right?\n\n209\n00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.760\nBecause the TTL timed out,\nand it threw those away.\n\n210\n00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.810\nAnd now, if I ping Google again,\n\n211\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.240\nit's gonna have to go back out through\nthe whole process and start that over.\n\n212\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.211\nWhich is fine, it'll do it.\n\n213\n00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:04.920\nAnd if I do another IP config, display\nDNS, I'll see all those entries in there.\n\n214\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.420\nAnd again, with that new TTL, looks like\nabout 300 seconds maybe is what I got for\n\n215\n00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.235\nthat, 295, as I ran the command.\n\n216\n00:11:13.235 --> 00:11:16.195\nSo now, the question is,\nwhere does that get set?\n\n217\n00:11:16.195 --> 00:11:18.635\nWho decides what that TTL is, right?\n\n218\n00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:20.335\nHow long I cache it.\n\n219\n00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:22.275\nAnd that is authoritative DNS server.\n\n220\n00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:25.415\nWhoever is responding,\nwhoever is resolving,\n\n221\n00:11:25.415 --> 00:11:28.345\nthey're actually doing the resolving\nof the name to the IP address.\n\n222\n00:11:28.345 --> 00:11:31.330\nSo when I query for google.com,\n\n223\n00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.630\nremember the process we\ntalked about in the drawing.\n\n224\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.620\nI talk to my local DNS server.\n\n225\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.690\nMy local DNS server\ndoesn't know Google.com,\n\n226\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.910\nbecause it's not authoritative for it.\n\n227\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:45.452\nSo it talks to the root, and then the dot\ncom, and then finally finds google.com's\n\n228\n00:11:45.452 --> 00:11:50.380\nauthoritative DNS server, and\nthat server gives my server the answer.\n\n229\n00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.660\nIn that answer is the TTL.\n\n230\n00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.050\nSo it's Google that decides how long\nwe cache their information for.\n\n231\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.820\nBut if I ping newegg.com, all right?\n\n232\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.580\nAnd I take a look at my cache again.\n\n233\n00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.730\nAnd we find newegg's.\n\n234\n00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.065\nLook their TTL's very short.\n\n235\n00:12:08.065 --> 00:12:10.190\nTme to live, 16 seconds.\n\n236\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.880\nSo they've decided that I can't cache\ntheir information for very long.\n\n237\n00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.060\nBut it's NewEgg.com,\n\n238\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.820\nit's their DNS server that told my machine\nhow long I'm allowed to cache that for.\n\n239\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.480\nSo I'm gonna show you where we can set\nthat, because we're authoritative.\n\n240\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.190\nLike ITProTV, right?\n\n241\n00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.530\nI maintain that DNS server, or you\nmaintain your organization's DNS server.\n\n242\n00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.170\nThat means you get to decide how long\nother people get to cache your records.\n\n243\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.310\nSo what do we put?\n\n244\n00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.630\nLet's take a look at the default\nsettings on a DNS server.\n\n245\n00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.230\nSo I'm gonna back over here to Tools.\n\n246\n00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.400\nAnd then DNS.\n\n247\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.520\nAnd I'm going to go down to my zone here,\nlab.itpro.tv.\n\n248\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.110\nAnd I'm gonna pull up,\nlet's start with one of these records.\n\n249\n00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.390\nI'm just gonna pull up server 01,\nall right?\n\n250\n00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.970\nAnd I don't see anything about\nTTL on this record at all.\n\n251\n00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.190\nWell, that's not gonna help us.\n\n252\n00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.500\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna go\nto our view menu, and turn on advanced so\n\n253\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.440\nwe can see some advanced stuff.\n\n254\n00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.550\nFancy.\n\n255\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.980\nNow, when I double- click on server01,\nin the Properties, I see a few new things.\n\n256\n00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.940\nI got the timestamp for when that\nrecord was created, and I see the TTL,\n\n257\n00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:24.020\nthe time to live, which in this case,\nis 20 minutes, right?\n\n258\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.943\nI'm gonna cancel that,\nI'm gonna click on that one.\n\n259\n00:13:25.943 --> 00:13:28.324\nNotice this one was a dynamically created.\n\n260\n00:13:28.324 --> 00:13:30.180\nNow you can see the time stamp over here.\n\n261\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.000\nWhat that means is, this is not a static,\nmanually created record.\n\n262\n00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.306\nThis is a record where the server called\nup DNS and said hey, my name's Server01,\n\n263\n00:13:38.306 --> 00:13:42.449\nhere's my IP address, 10.10.8.201,\ncan you make a record for me?\n\n264\n00:13:42.449 --> 00:13:45.140\nDNS does it, and\nit marks it with a time stamp on there.\n\n265\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.642\nAnd that has to do with replication and\nsome other things.\n\n266\n00:13:48.642 --> 00:13:51.120\nWe'll talk about that I\nthink in some other episode.\n\n267\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.588\nNothing really to do with the caching.\n\n268\n00:13:52.588 --> 00:13:56.610\nBut I wanna show you that, because\nlet's look at one of these static ones.\n\n269\n00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.720\nThis is a statically created record.\n\n270\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.980\nIf I double-click on that,\nnotice the TTL is one hour, all right?\n\n271\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.150\nSo it's one hour, by default.\n\n272\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.300\nNow, that value, so\nstatically created records, one hour.\n\n273\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.690\nDynamically created records is\ngoing to be 20 minutes, by default.\n\n274\n00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.120\nThe dynamic one,\nthat's part of the DNS client settings.\n\n275\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.100\nI don't know of a really\nan easy way to change that.\n\n276\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.170\nBut those static ones, if we pull up\nthe properties of our DNS server,\n\n277\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.030\nor, I'm sorry, the properties of the zone.\n\n278\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:32.400\nAnd that's probably important to know as\nwell, that it is on a per zone basis.\n\n279\n00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.030\nSo if you had more than one zone\nthis server was authoritative for,\n\n280\n00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.220\nI could configure different TTLs.\n\n281\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.291\n&gt;&gt; Pick and choose different-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n282\n00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:38.847\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n283\n00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:42.183\n&gt;&gt; We might have one\nthat needs a longer TTL.\n\n284\n00:14:42.183 --> 00:14:45.174\nSo here on the properties of the zone, and\n\n285\n00:14:45.174 --> 00:14:50.530\nthen on the Start of Authority tab,\nhere's a TTL for this record.\n\n286\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.620\nBut that TTL, or it's for\nthis record, the actual SOA record.\n\n287\n00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:00.180\nRight above that is my minimum\ndefault TTL of one hour.\n\n288\n00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.930\nSo that's where that value is\ncoming from when we create static\n\n289\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.150\nrecords is right here.\n\n290\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.970\nSo I need to change that.\n\n291\n00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.450\nI can change that, I'll say three hours.\n\n292\n00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.410\nAnd I'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n293\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.300\nNow, if I go back to DCO1,\nthe TTL's still one hour.\n\n294\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.800\nAnd that's because this record was\ncreated before I made the change, right?\n\n295\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.220\nIt's not gonna go back and\nupdate existing records, but\n\n296\n00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.360\nnew records that we create,\nwe'll create a new A record for test.\n\n297\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.230\nAnd I give it an address of something\nother than, whoops, we'll just say 54,\n\n298\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.870\nI know that's not in use.\n\n299\n00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.750\nNotice what the default TTL is.\n\n300\n00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.550\nSee it set there to three?\n\n301\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.270\n&gt;&gt; Three hours.\n\n302\n00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:40.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that will be the default\nfor my new statically created records.\n\n303\n00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.220\nNotice there's no timestamp.\n\n304\n00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.590\nIt doesn't say static, but there's no\ntimestamp so we know it is static.\n\n305\n00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.310\nThis one says static.\n\n306\n00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.316\nI didn't actually create that.\n\n307\n00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:51.180\nThat one is created statically\nwhen you install Active Directory.\n\n308\n00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.850\nThat says all right,\nyou've gotta have a static address.\n\n309\n00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.225\nYour domain controller's IP address\nshouldn't change, and it goes in.\n\n310\n00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:57.565\n&gt;&gt; People need to find you.\n\n311\n00:15:57.565 --> 00:16:00.175\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so it registers it and it creates\n\n312\n00:16:00.175 --> 00:16:04.310\nit static so it doesn't have to be updated\ncuz it shouldn't be changing, all right?\n\n313\n00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.720\nAll right so we can change that TTL,\n\n314\n00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.110\nnow the question then is what do\nwe change it to and why, right?\n\n315\n00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.570\nWhat's a good value for that?\n\n316\n00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.495\nAnd what you wanna think about is there's\ntwo things that we're really worried about\n\n317\n00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:18.570\nwhen we think about how\nlong to set that cache for.\n\n318\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.520\nHonestly the defaults are typically\nfine for most scenarios.\n\n319\n00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.840\nBut you see, Google definitely doesn't use\nthat, Newegg definitely doesn't use that.\n\n320\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.110\nSo why are they changing it,\nwhat's the benefit of doing that?\n\n321\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.970\nWell think about what we're saying.\n\n322\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.740\nWhen we change the TTL,\nwe're deciding how long\n\n323\n00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.810\nsomebody's able to hold onto that\ncached information all right?\n\n324\n00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.290\nSo the longer they hold onto it,\n\n325\n00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.610\nthe less queries they've gotta\nsend to my DNS server, right?\n\n326\n00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.426\nBecause if they only hold it for\n15 seconds and throw it away, and\n\n327\n00:16:48.426 --> 00:16:51.922\nthen they have to back to that webpage,\nthey're gonna query my DNS server again.\n\n328\n00:16:51.922 --> 00:16:55.189\nBecause the cache timed out,\nthe TTL expired, they threw it away,\n\n329\n00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:57.551\nand they're gonna have\nto query all over again.\n\n330\n00:16:57.551 --> 00:17:00.113\nThat means everybody that's coming\nto my site is gonna be constantly\n\n331\n00:17:00.113 --> 00:17:01.049\nquerying my DNS server.\n\n332\n00:17:01.049 --> 00:17:02.067\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of traffic.\n\n333\n00:17:02.067 --> 00:17:06.240\n&gt;&gt; So it is gonna increase the number\nof queries that my DNS server is\n\n334\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.274\nresponding to because\nof that very short TTL.\n\n335\n00:17:09.274 --> 00:17:12.258\nSo you might think well good let's\nset it for eight hour, right?\n\n336\n00:17:12.258 --> 00:17:14.850\nWell if you set for it eight hours\n\n337\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.710\nyou're gonna reduce the amount of\ntraffic going to your DNS server, sure.\n\n338\n00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:23.080\nBut you're going to,\nwhat's a good way to say this?\n\n339\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.330\nYou're gonna lose your\ndynamic capabilities, right?\n\n340\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.410\nWhat if you have five web servers, right?\n\n341\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.820\nYou want people rotating\nbetween those web servers.\n\n342\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.580\nSo we typically use DNS round robining,\n\n343\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.620\nwhere it'll return all five\nweb servers' IP addresses.\n\n344\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.740\nBut every time it does, it rotates\nthe order that the answers come in.\n\n345\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.875\nSo that each time you go to their website\nyou're using a different server or\n\n346\n00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:49.500\nat least you're rotating through.\n\n347\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.985\nMaybe not you in particular, but\n\n348\n00:17:50.985 --> 00:17:53.968\neach client of theirs each customer\nthat goes into their website.\n\n349\n00:17:53.968 --> 00:17:57.840\nShould be kinda rotating through those web\nservers like a poor man load balancing.\n\n350\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.494\nAnd if that person is caching that server\nfor eight hours, now my load balancing,\n\n351\n00:18:02.494 --> 00:18:03.649\nmy round robining.\n\n352\n00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:05.078\n&gt;&gt; That technique is thrown off yeah.\n\n353\n00:18:05.078 --> 00:18:09.624\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and what if we get unlucky and\n80% of my clients,\n\n354\n00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:16.280\nmy customers just happen to cache\nthe same web server's IP address, right?\n\n355\n00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.992\nSo now 80% of my customers\nare hitting one web server.\n\n356\n00:18:19.992 --> 00:18:22.813\nYou've got four other web servers\nthat are sitting there twiddling\n\n357\n00:18:22.813 --> 00:18:24.180\ntheir thumbs, right?\n\n358\n00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.739\nSo and that's probably why Newegg has\na very short TTL, same thing with Google.\n\n359\n00:18:29.739 --> 00:18:33.960\nTheir's is a little bit longer,\nprobably a little more realistic.\n\n360\n00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.323\nI have not seen too many\nTTLs that were that short,\n\n361\n00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:38.815\nthat kinda surprised me\nwhen I pulled up Newegg's.\n\n362\n00:18:38.815 --> 00:18:40.438\nBut I'm sure they've got\na very good reason for\n\n363\n00:18:40.438 --> 00:18:41.748\ndoing what they're doing with that.\n\n364\n00:18:41.748 --> 00:18:45.852\n&gt;&gt; Well you gotta also think,\nnow that virtualization is so popular,\n\n365\n00:18:45.852 --> 00:18:50.420\nI mean comparing it back to what maybe\nten years ago or something like that.\n\n366\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.180\nIt's easier to change\nthings on the backend side.\n\n367\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.550\nSo yeah, just to have that\nextra flexibility in case\n\n368\n00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.442\nI wanted to move things around and\nchange IP addresses or whatever.\n\n369\n00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:03.010\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and you think about\nthe elasticity of the cloud and\n\n370\n00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.211\nas new age servers, as they get busy.\n\n371\n00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:08.521\nIf they're virtual I'm just guessing,\nI don't work for Newegg, but\n\n372\n00:19:08.521 --> 00:19:09.910\nany organization like that.\n\n373\n00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:14.900\nIf they've got their website set up taking\nadvantage of elasticity in the cloud.\n\n374\n00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.890\nAs they get busy during their peak times,\nit spins up eight new servers.\n\n375\n00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.320\nNow there's eight new IP addresses\nthat we gotta throw into that pool.\n\n376\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.520\nBut then as business dies off,\nwe get into later hours of the night and\n\n377\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.420\nless traffic, some of those web\nservers are gonna be shut down.\n\n378\n00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.671\nAnd to reduce the footprint\nup there in the cloud, and\n\n379\n00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:35.432\nprobably the cost associated with that.\n\n380\n00:19:35.432 --> 00:19:39.603\nAnd I don't want people caching for\nan hour an IP address for a website that,\n\n381\n00:19:39.603 --> 00:19:42.420\nthat particular server\nmight have been shut down.\n\n382\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.891\nBecause there's not enough business,\nor what have you.\n\n383\n00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:48.750\nSo very good point with the cloud\nthat definitely changes things.\n\n384\n00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.220\nAll right so\nnow we know how to set our TTL for\n\n385\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.510\nour records we're authoritative for.\n\n386\n00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.258\nAnd we know kinda why, or\nwe've got some information to help\n\n387\n00:19:59.258 --> 00:20:02.810\nus decide what would be best for\nour organization.\n\n388\n00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.438\nIf you're in an organization where\nDNS is primarily, if it's just for\n\n389\n00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:09.472\ninternal use connecting to\nfile servers things like that.\n\n390\n00:20:09.472 --> 00:20:13.214\nAnd things don't change that often\nset it for a couple of hours,\n\n391\n00:20:13.214 --> 00:20:16.210\nset it for a business day,\nor something like that.\n\n392\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:16.800\nEight hours,\n\n393\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.210\nI don't know this is something you guys\nhave to decide within your organization.\n\n394\n00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.665\nBut that would reduce the number\nof queries going to DNS.\n\n395\n00:20:22.665 --> 00:20:26.734\nBut if you're in a very dynamic\nenvironment, you might wanna reduce that\n\n396\n00:20:26.734 --> 00:20:31.150\ndefault TTL, or just leave it at\nthe default and kinda see how things go.\n\n397\n00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.352\nSomething that you've got to monitor.\n\n398\n00:20:33.352 --> 00:20:40.807\nAll right so next, ass we've said, so\nwe understand why it's temporary, right?\n\n399\n00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:45.100\nBut what we also have to\nthink about now is all right,\n\n400\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.750\nwhat if normally a TTL of\none hour works fine for us.\n\n401\n00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.622\nBut there are gonna be times\nwhen that's still too long.\n\n402\n00:20:52.622 --> 00:20:58.910\nLet's say one of my users is connecting\nto a file share up on a server.\n\n403\n00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.357\nSo they've queried DNS and they've got\nthe IP address of that file server, and\n\n404\n00:21:02.357 --> 00:21:05.094\nthey've been told to cache it for\nan hour, the default right?\n\n405\n00:21:05.094 --> 00:21:07.220\nAnd so now they can connect to\nthe file server, everything's good.\n\n406\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.490\nIn the meantime,\nwe did some network reconfiguration.\n\n407\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.820\nOr we've had to change that IP address,\na network adapter.\n\n408\n00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:22.110\nMany number of reasons why the IP address\nthat's hosting that share might change.\n\n409\n00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.050\nAnd so we go in, maybe somebody calls\nus up, we have to go make that change.\n\n410\n00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.953\nAnd now the user's calling us up and\nsaying hey,\n\n411\n00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.390\nI can't connect to the file share anymore.\n\n412\n00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.603\nAnd so we as IT people we pull out\nour command prompt or PowerShell, and\n\n413\n00:21:33.603 --> 00:21:35.844\nwe ping the IP address that\nwe just changed it to.\n\n414\n00:21:35.844 --> 00:21:37.088\nAnd we're like, it's responding fine.\n\n415\n00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.531\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] [LAUGH].\n\n416\n00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:42.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I don't know what your problem is,\nbecause it's responding to me just fine.\n\n417\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.917\nWell you're using the IP address\nthat you've just changed it to,\n\n418\n00:21:45.917 --> 00:21:48.790\nyou might have even all ready updated DNS,\nright?\n\n419\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.380\nAnd again you're doing\nyour troubleshooting,\n\n420\n00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.440\nyou verify that DNS has the right\nIP address for the server.\n\n421\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.275\nAnd yet\nthey still can't connect to that machine,\n\n422\n00:21:58.275 --> 00:22:00.435\nand that's because of caching, right?\n\n423\n00:22:00.435 --> 00:22:03.025\nBecause they've cached the old IP address,\nand\n\n424\n00:22:03.025 --> 00:22:05.895\nnow we need to get rid of that bad entry.\n\n425\n00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:09.855\nWe need to force them to talk to\nDNS again to get the latest or\n\n426\n00:22:09.855 --> 00:22:11.515\nthe current information.\n\n427\n00:22:11.515 --> 00:22:13.950\nAnd we do that by flushing the cache,\n\n428\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.545\nright flushing the cache\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n429\n00:22:16.545 --> 00:22:21.470\nSo let's take a look at how we can\ndo that from a command prompt.\n\n430\n00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.340\nLet me clear out my screen,\nlet's do another IP config display.\n\n431\n00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.837\nMake sure I've got some stuff cached\nin there, there's some IT Pro stuff.\n\n432\n00:22:28.837 --> 00:22:34.541\nLet's ping Google again,\nand let's ping Newegg.\n\n433\n00:22:34.541 --> 00:22:38.564\nAlthough theirs won't be in long enough to\nactually work with it, that 16 seconds.\n\n434\n00:22:38.564 --> 00:22:42.276\nBut now I should be able to\ngo back into display DNS, and\n\n435\n00:22:42.276 --> 00:22:46.166\nI've got a bunch of records\ncached in there, all right?\n\n436\n00:22:46.166 --> 00:22:50.744\nSo if we determine that we\nneed to get rid of that,\n\n437\n00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:57.366\nwell then what we can do is,\nis we can do ipconfig /flushdns, right?\n\n438\n00:22:57.366 --> 00:23:02.310\nIpconfig /flushdn,\nthat clears the DNS client resolver cache.\n\n439\n00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.406\nIf I do another ipconfig display DNS,\n\n440\n00:23:04.406 --> 00:23:08.081\nwe'll see there's nothing to\ndisplay in the DNS resolver cache.\n\n441\n00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:11.360\nCuz I haven't resolved anything\nsince I flushed it, all right?\n\n442\n00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.470\nSo that's how we can get rid\nof it with the command prompt.\n\n443\n00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:20.928\nFrom PowerShell we're gonna be using\nclear, and you do have to spell it right.\n\n444\n00:23:20.928 --> 00:23:21.844\n&gt;&gt; It helps.\n\n445\n00:23:21.844 --> 00:23:27.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Carly I can't type,\nClear-DNSClientCache.\n\n446\n00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.372\n&gt;&gt; That was me yesterday.\n\n447\n00:23:28.372 --> 00:23:33.832\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nnow if we do another Get-DNSClientCache\n\n448\n00:23:33.832 --> 00:23:36.580\nyou'll see there's nothing in there.\n\n449\n00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.096\nAlso keep in mind there's only one cache,\nright?\n\n450\n00:23:39.096 --> 00:23:42.692\nThere's not a separate cache that\nI'm working with from PowerShell\n\n451\n00:23:42.692 --> 00:23:43.499\nversus my CLI.\n\n452\n00:23:43.499 --> 00:23:47.024\nThey're both manipulating the same\ntemporary storage or that same cache,\n\n453\n00:23:47.024 --> 00:23:49.830\njust different commands,\ndifferent interfaces.\n\n454\n00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.325\nTo work with that same cache, all right.\n\n455\n00:23:52.325 --> 00:23:56.063\nSo for as far as the client goes,\nwe've seen how to\n\n456\n00:23:56.063 --> 00:24:00.423\nview the DNS client resolver cache and-\n&gt;&gt; Wash it.\n\n457\n00:24:00.423 --> 00:24:03.812\n&gt;&gt; Clear, yeah,\nthat DNS client resolver cache, but\n\n458\n00:24:03.812 --> 00:24:08.215\nthere's something else we're\ngonna have to think about, right.\n\n459\n00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:12.600\nThe DNS server also caches information.\n\n460\n00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:18.280\nAnd so, I'm gonna show you an example\nof where that's gonna come into play,\n\n461\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.280\nprobably in our next episode.\n\n462\n00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.990\nBut let's take a look, while we got a few\nminutes left, let's jump over here to DNS.\n\n463\n00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.420\nAnd let's see if we can see\nthe servers cache, all right?\n\n464\n00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.570\nAnd because we turned on the advanced\nview earlier to look at the TTL,\n\n465\n00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.290\nI can see cache look ups.\n\n466\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:37.330\nUnderstand that when you go to your DNS\nserver, you might not see cache lookups,\n\n467\n00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.880\nit'll look more like this.\n\n468\n00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.970\nSo if you don't see it, you advanced and\nnow we have our cache lookups.\n\n469\n00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.060\nAnd in here, it's gonna be\norganized by the very top, right,\n\n470\n00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.670\nthat hierarchical structure so\nthere's root at the very top, and\n\n471\n00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:55.510\nthere's some of the different top level\ndomains that I've recently talked to.\n\n472\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.710\nWait, it's so funny when you come in\nhere and even on your clients machine,\n\n473\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.070\nespecially on servers like,\nwho talked to these people?\n\n474\n00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.872\nYou gotta think about all the banner ads.\n\n475\n00:25:03.872 --> 00:25:07.110\nIt has to resolve those names\nto go retrieve banner ads and\n\n476\n00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.090\nall the other stuff that\nappears on those web pages.\n\n477\n00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:15.980\nSo if we take a look underneath com,\nand there's Google, and\n\n478\n00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.070\nthere's all those records, right?\n\n479\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.850\nWe also talked about Newegg.\n\n480\n00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.560\nSo, there's all those records,\nas well, all right?\n\n481\n00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.020\nSo this is the DNS server cache,\n\n482\n00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.740\nnot the DNS client resolver cache,\nthis is the DNS server cache.\n\n483\n00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.390\nThis is how you can view it,\nwe can clear it from right here.\n\n484\n00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.010\nI can right click on this,\nand I can choose clear cache.\n\n485\n00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.020\nWe wanna be careful with that,\nit's not gonna hurt anything.\n\n486\n00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.530\nIf right-click and clear cache,\nit's definitely not gonna hurt DNS or\n\n487\n00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.700\ncause any problems as far\nas that is concerned.\n\n488\n00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:55.215\nBut the whole point of using cache\nwas to speed things up, right?\n\n489\n00:25:55.215 --> 00:25:59.535\n&gt;&gt; So it has to basically propagate that\nlist and those records all over again?\n\n490\n00:25:59.535 --> 00:26:03.365\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, once I clear it, there's nothing\nleft in the cache and so now any queries\n\n491\n00:26:03.365 --> 00:26:06.385\nthat come into this DNS server,\nI'm gonna have to go look them up again.\n\n492\n00:26:06.385 --> 00:26:09.105\nAnd eventually,\nI'll start populating the cache again and\n\n493\n00:26:09.105 --> 00:26:11.365\nthere's no guarantee the same\nsites are gonna be in there.\n\n494\n00:26:11.365 --> 00:26:14.950\nUnless they happen to go to the same\nsites, but yeah, there's no more cache.\n\n495\n00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.400\nSo now we have to start all over and\nslowly build up that cache again.\n\n496\n00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.990\n&gt;&gt; So Mike what your saying,\nif I have to go ahead and modify,\n\n497\n00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:26.040\nif I know a specific or couple specific\nentries that I need to refresh or just get\n\n498\n00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.046\nrid of, it's better to granularly-\n&gt;&gt; Granularly.\n\n499\n00:26:31.046 --> 00:26:35.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, that word to go ahead and\n\n500\n00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.210\ndelete them individually,\ninstead of just as a whole.\n\n501\n00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.350\nOr holistically they're deleting,\nflushing everything, or\n\n502\n00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.264\nI guess I should say flush it,\nin that particular sense.\n\n503\n00:26:42.264 --> 00:26:43.110\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n504\n00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.980\n&gt;&gt; But, deleting it all at once.\n\n505\n00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, and let's take a look.\n\n506\n00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:52.130\nLet's do Google.com again,\nlet's ping newegg.com again.\n\n507\n00:26:53.280 --> 00:27:00.430\nLet's add in Microsoft, .com, all right.\n\n508\n00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.606\nAnd something interesting\nto point out here,\n\n509\n00:27:02.606 --> 00:27:06.250\nMicrosoft doesn't respond to pings and\nmany sites don't respond to pings.\n\n510\n00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:10.437\nBecause of a lot of the different attacks\nthat can be used and things like that,\n\n511\n00:27:10.437 --> 00:27:14.562\nespecially at least on their public\nfacing side, they don't allow pings But\n\n512\n00:27:14.562 --> 00:27:17.559\nunderstand that the DNS\nprocess still occurs, right.\n\n513\n00:27:17.559 --> 00:27:21.804\nBecause in order to ping this and find\nout that they're not responding to ping\n\n514\n00:27:21.804 --> 00:27:24.740\npackets, I have to turn that\nname into an IP address,\n\n515\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.050\nand then attempt to ping that IP address.\n\n516\n00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.310\nAnd that's when I get the whole,\nthey're not responding.\n\n517\n00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.780\nSo when you're testing\nout things like DNS,\n\n518\n00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.570\neven if you don't get a response from\nthe ping, the fact that it was able to\n\n519\n00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:41.170\nturn the name into an IP address tells\nme that the DNS is working properly.\n\n520\n00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:42.880\nThe whole fact that it\ndidn't respond the ping,\n\n521\n00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.410\nthat's a completely separate thing, right.\n\n522\n00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.430\nThat could be a network issue or\nsomething like that but\n\n523\n00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.160\nthat's completely separate just\nmake sure we're clear on that.\n\n524\n00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.370\n&gt;&gt; And you're giving this example here\nbecause I feel like your probably more\n\n525\n00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:59.010\ncomfortable working and being able to show\nand demonstrate quickly within a CLI.\n\n526\n00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.410\nBut if you're new to this and you're\nnot sure why is he doing it that way,\n\n527\n00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:05.790\nit's any time you're trying to create that\nor communicate with that other device.\n\n528\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.957\nSo if you were just to use a browser, but\n\n529\n00:28:07.957 --> 00:28:12.053\nyou normally aren't browsing the web\non a server, but just so you know.\n\n530\n00:28:12.053 --> 00:28:13.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, in fact,\nthat's a great point.\n\n531\n00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.740\nLet's go take a look at\nthat here in just a second.\n\n532\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:21.030\nSo if I go to my cache, I'm gonna have\nto refresh my console, expand out cache.\n\n533\n00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.599\nAnd notice everything is back or, at\nleast, the sites I have been to recently,\n\n534\n00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:26.270\nstarting to repopulate that cache.\n\n535\n00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.852\nBut to Cherokee's point earlier, what\nI was saying about clearing the cache,\n\n536\n00:28:29.852 --> 00:28:31.992\nif you don't know exactly\nwhat the problem is,\n\n537\n00:28:31.992 --> 00:28:34.178\nnothing wrong with\nflushing the entire cache.\n\n538\n00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:37.260\nUnderstand that DNS response\nwill be a little bit slower\n\n539\n00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.120\nuntil you rebuild that cache, but\nwe're talking milliseconds, right?\n\n540\n00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.470\nWe're not talking hours here so\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n541\n00:28:44.838 --> 00:28:47.490\nBut if I do know what\nthe problem record is,\n\n542\n00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.740\nlike in the example I was using earlier\nwith a particular file server, absolutely.\n\n543\n00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.850\nGo in, find the one record for\n\n544\n00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.770\nthat file server, right-click and\ndelete that one record.\n\n545\n00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.130\nRight, that way I'm not\nwiping out the entire cache.\n\n546\n00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.807\nCuz there wasn't anything\nwrong with the other stuff.\n\n547\n00:29:04.807 --> 00:29:07.926\nBut I can at least wipe\nout that one record and\n\n548\n00:29:07.926 --> 00:29:10.719\nthen see if that's solved my problem.\n\n549\n00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:14.775\nBut if all of the same TTL,\njust like the DNS client resolver,\n\n550\n00:29:14.775 --> 00:29:16.810\nthese are cached the same way.\n\n551\n00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.990\nIf I look in here,\nthere's still a TTL associated with it.\n\n552\n00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:24.860\nIt's slowly ticking down so as far as\nthe cache process goes, no different.\n\n553\n00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:29.960\nBut definitely two different caches, DNS\nclient resolver cache, DNS server cache.\n\n554\n00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:35.350\nWe're talking about working with the DNS\nserver cache from the command prompt,\n\n555\n00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.700\nit's not ipconfig, right?\n\n556\n00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.570\nIpconfig, displaydns, and flushDNS Athat's\nfor the DNS client resolver cache.\n\n557\n00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.356\nTo work with the DNS server cache,\ndnscmd and I probably didn't launch\n\n558\n00:29:45.356 --> 00:29:49.411\nan administrative command prompt,\nwe're gonna find out here in a second.\n\n559\n00:29:49.411 --> 00:29:56.290\nDnscmd/, really it's weird\nto look at the zones here.\n\n560\n00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:02.510\nWe're gonna do enumzones, all right,\nand yep, access is denied.\n\n561\n00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:09.250\nSo let's pull up an administrative command\nprompt, and try that again, all right.\n\n562\n00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.702\nDNS cmd /enumzones is how I can\nlist all of the zones and really,\n\n563\n00:30:13.702 --> 00:30:17.002\nwhen we're dealing with\nthe DNS server cache,\n\n564\n00:30:17.002 --> 00:30:20.760\nthe cache is treated like\nanother zone file, right.\n\n565\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.740\nJust like my lab at\nITProTV is a zone file.\n\n566\n00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.140\nThat's treated like another zone file and\n\n567\n00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.570\nyou can see it right here,\nit's represented by a dot, all right?\n\n568\n00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:34.636\nSo I can do a dnscmd /zoneprint if I\n\n569\n00:30:34.636 --> 00:30:39.718\ncan spell that, dot, all right?\n\n570\n00:30:39.718 --> 00:30:44.740\nAnd there are my good old\ncache records as well.\n\n571\n00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.960\nAll right, this also shows you a little\nbit of information about the server.\n\n572\n00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.560\nAnother command you can do, actually,\n\n573\n00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.620\nI don't know if you can\ndo that with this one.\n\n574\n00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.490\nNope, I don't think you can.\n\n575\n00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.820\nAll right, so that's how you view it.\n\n576\n00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.924\nI'll tell you, I don't use that often,\nalthough it's definitely could be handy.\n\n577\n00:31:00.924 --> 00:31:04.120\nI wanna have you several times,\nso I was clearing the cache.\n\n578\n00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.293\nAgain, the server cache,\nnot the client cache,\n\n579\n00:31:07.293 --> 00:31:12.940\ndnscmd /clearcache, all right?\n\n580\n00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.820\nLet's make sure there's something in\nour cache, so let me refresh this.\n\n581\n00:31:18.444 --> 00:31:23.215\nAll right, so we got all this stuff\nin my cache, gonna go over here and\n\n582\n00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:25.714\ndo a dnscmd /clearcache, Enter.\n\n583\n00:31:25.714 --> 00:31:28.617\nSays, it .completed successfully.\n\n584\n00:31:28.617 --> 00:31:29.490\n&gt;&gt; Do we trust it?\n\n585\n00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, we're gonna verify.\n\n586\n00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.116\nTrust but verify, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, always.\n\n587\n00:31:33.116 --> 00:31:36.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm gonna refresh, and\nsure enough, everything's gone except for\n\n588\n00:31:36.807 --> 00:31:40.162\nsomething known as root hints,\nwhich are coming up in another show.\n\n589\n00:31:40.162 --> 00:31:42.535\nAnd I know we're just about out of time,\nCherokee.\n\n590\n00:31:42.535 --> 00:31:45.414\nLet me show you the PowerShell\ncommands to do the same thing.\n\n591\n00:31:45.414 --> 00:31:50.454\nLet's ping Google.com, and we'll ping\n\n592\n00:31:50.454 --> 00:31:56.060\nmicrosoft.com, get something in our cache.\n\n593\n00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.190\nOops, that is not a valid command.\n\n594\n00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.740\nAnd if we take a look at our cache,\n\n595\n00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.500\nwe should see that we now have\nsome things populated in here.\n\n596\n00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.180\nWe got Google.\n\n597\n00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.080\nI don't see Microsoft pop up yet.\n\n598\n00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:11.410\nThat's alright.\n\n599\n00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.333\nWe've got some stuff in the cache.\n\n600\n00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:15.596\nAnd oops, I'm in PowerShell.\n\n601\n00:32:15.596 --> 00:32:17.740\nThere we go.\n\n602\n00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.960\nWait, what did we do?\n\n603\n00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:24.544\nYeah, we did the DNSCMD from\nPowerShell to work with the cache.\n\n604\n00:32:24.544 --> 00:32:27.735\nAll right, we want to be able to get\n\n605\n00:32:27.735 --> 00:32:36.460\n-dnsservercache, and, again,\nhelps if you spell it right.\n\n606\n00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.173\nAnd this command, which you think\nmight return the cache, doesn't.\n\n607\n00:32:42.173 --> 00:32:47.110\n[LAUGH] What it's actually giving me is\ninformation about the DNS server cache.\n\n608\n00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:51.420\nIt shows me my TTLs, my replication times,\nand locking percent, so\n\n609\n00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.340\nit really didn't show\nme what I need to see.\n\n610\n00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.790\nSo we don't want to use that command.\n\n611\n00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:57.692\nBut I show you that one, because it\nkinda would makes sense in your head.\n\n612\n00:32:57.692 --> 00:33:00.035\nYou're thinking, okay,\nDNS server cache is the noun.\n\n613\n00:33:00.035 --> 00:33:03.213\n&gt;&gt; I would probably, yeah, automatically\nthink of get, cuz that's a very common-\n\n614\n00:33:03.213 --> 00:33:04.690\n&gt;&gt; Get should be my read command, right.\n\n615\n00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it normally is.\n\n616\n00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:11.390\nBut in this case,\nit's actually show-dnsservercache.\n\n617\n00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.580\nAnd that shows you the actual cache,\n\n618\n00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.940\nso get is showing you properties\nabout the cache itself.\n\n619\n00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.640\nWhereas DNS server,\n\n620\n00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.540\nshow DNS server cache just showed you\nthe records found within the cache.\n\n621\n00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:30.000\nAll right, and then to flush that,\nclear-dnsservercache,\n\n622\n00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.850\nand are you sure you want to do with that?\n\n623\n00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:37.459\nYes I am, and\nif we take a look at it again,\n\n624\n00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:43.400\ndnsservercache is still populated.\n\n625\n00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.380\nSorry, I was like,\nwait there's still records in there.\n\n626\n00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.192\nThe only thing that's left-\n&gt;&gt; Root servers-\n\n627\n00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:48.519\n&gt;&gt; Are root servers, right,\n\n628\n00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:51.190\nwhich we're gonna talk about\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n629\n00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:56.350\nWe'll explain what those guys are and\nhow they help us out.\n\n630\n00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.520\nAnd the last thing,\nI know I said that was the last thing.\n\n631\n00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.170\n&gt;&gt; I know, Mike.\n[LAUGH]\n\n632\n00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.080\n&gt;&gt; There was one more thing.\n\n633\n00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.690\nYou said something about the client, and\nit made me think about going over to\n\n634\n00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:07.040\nthe client, and now I don't remember\nwhat it was you said, honestly.\n\n635\n00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.826\n&gt;&gt; Well, how about this?\n\n636\n00:34:07.826 --> 00:34:10.771\nLet's go ahead and pause, and\nwe'll end this episode but\n\n637\n00:34:10.771 --> 00:34:14.870\npick right back up with that part,\ngoodness, I don't even know where we are.\n\n638\n00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Part one for this one,\nI changed the name.\n\n639\n00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you changed the name, okay.\n\n640\n00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.411\n&gt;&gt; Get tired of going to part four and\nfive. &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n641\n00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:19.877\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n642\n00:34:19.877 --> 00:34:21.366\n&gt;&gt; But we're still gonna be looking at\n\n643\n00:34:21.366 --> 00:34:23.280\nDNS, so\nyou definitely wanna hang around for that.\n\n644\n00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.950\nAnd hopefully, Mike will remember what\nit was that he wanted to show you.\n\n645\n00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:28.030\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure I will.\n\n646\n00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.625\nI'm sure I will.\n\n647\n00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:30.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We thank you anyways, and\n\n648\n00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:32.060\nwe thank you for being with us, as well.\n\n649\n00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.550\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n650\n00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.725\nI've been your host Cherokee

Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:32.666\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n14\n00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.166\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.574\n&gt;&gt; Truther is an app, but\n\n16\n00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:38.260\nhopefully you guys are finding\nDNS exciting at least.\n\n17\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.140\nAll right, so we left off in our part one.\n\n18\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.080\nWe had gone through really\ncaching was the big topic.\n\n19\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.670\nWhere we looked at the DNS server cache,\nwe looked at the client resolver cache.\n\n20\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.730\nWe saw how we could manage those caches,\nbeing able to view them, flush them.\n\n21\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.220\nRemember they're independent.\n\n22\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.990\nAnd I'll show you an example in\na little bit of where that really\n\n23\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.480\nmakes a difference.\n\n24\n00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.820\nWe also talked about the TTL and\n\n25\n00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.190\nhow we could change that default\nwhere to see that information.\n\n26\n00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.890\n&gt;&gt; You know I forgot to ask you,\ndid you ever remember that thing?\n\n27\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.775\n&gt;&gt; No I was waiting for\nyou to remember the question you asked me.\n\n28\n00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:11.924\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay well anyways,\n\n29\n00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:13.745\nwe might eventually get to the thing.\n\n30\n00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:15.180\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure we'll cover it.\n\n31\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.670\nIf it was important we will cover it.\n\n32\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.870\nAll right, so\n\n33\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.980\nthe next thing I want to talk about is\nsomething known as root hints, all right?\n\n34\n00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.410\nAnd let's ponder for a second.\n\n35\n00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.172\nYeah we talked about-\n&gt;&gt; Shall we?\n\n36\n00:01:28.172 --> 00:01:28.820\n&gt;&gt; Yes we shall.\n\n37\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.818\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's.\n\n38\n00:01:31.818 --> 00:01:36.704\nWe talked previously about how DNS works\nand how we resolve external names.\n\n39\n00:01:36.704 --> 00:01:40.240\nWe know that we have a DNS server\nthat we maintain in our organization\n\n40\n00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.420\nthat handles all local name resolution.\n\n41\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.370\nIt's authoritative for our organization.\n\n42\n00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.870\nRight?\nITPRO.TV here.\n\n43\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.560\nYour organization wherever you are.\n\n44\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.620\nYou maintain a DNS server for\nyour own records.\n\n45\n00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.640\nYou might not maintain it in-house, right?\n\n46\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.040\nYou might pay somebody to host it for you.\n\n47\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.380\nBut you're still responsible for\n\n48\n00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.980\nmaking sure those records\nare hosted somewhere, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.010\nBut when I wanna resolve external names,\n\n50\n00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.560\nmy DNS server doesn't know about\nyour organizations IP addresses,\n\n51\n00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.370\nor Microsoft's IP addresses, or,\nNewgg's IP addresses, right?\n\n52\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.260\nSo we saw how we went to the root,\nthe very top, and then we went, root,\n\n53\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.050\nand then TLD, and\nwe found that authoritative DNS Server.\n\n54\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.210\nThe question we should be asking ourselves\nis, how do we get all that started, right?\n\n55\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.140\nWe said you can't connect to\na machine without an IP address,\n\n56\n00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.650\nyou have to have an IP address.\n\n57\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.972\nYet I connected to root,\nwhere was the DNS query that said,\n\n58\n00:02:34.972 --> 00:02:37.030\nhey, what's the IP address of root, right?\n\n59\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.440\nWe didn't see any of that, did we?\n\n60\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.491\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n61\n00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:41.240\n&gt;&gt; And it really does bring\nup a good point, though.\n\n62\n00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.758\nBecause I remember a very long time ago,\nwhen I was first learning about DNS, and\n\n63\n00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:45.863\nI thought exactly that.\n\n64\n00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:48.526\nI thought,\nWell if we do have those root servers, and\n\n65\n00:02:48.526 --> 00:02:52.727\nwe kind of alluded to this before how they\ncan't maintain everything, well why do we\n\n66\n00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:54.860\neven need our private DNS servers-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n67\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.240\n&gt;&gt; If they can store all that?\n\n68\n00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.974\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But in all actuality they really can't.\n\n69\n00:02:57.974 --> 00:02:59.146\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we need that.\n\n70\n00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:02.342\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it'd be way too much work.\n\n71\n00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:07.525\nSo, how does my DNS server start that\nexternal name resolution process and\n\n72\n00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:10.662\nfind that route server and\nwork its way down?\n\n73\n00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:12.710\nAnd that's what the route hints are,\nright?\n\n74\n00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.620\nRoute hints are just that, hints.\n\n75\n00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.090\nHey, the IP address of the root is, right?\n\n76\n00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.123\nIt's a little hint for\nmy DNS server, it's kinda preloaded.\n\n77\n00:03:20.123 --> 00:03:21.828\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou didn't have to manually put that in.\n\n78\n00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:24.047\n&gt;&gt; No, absolutely not,\nlet's go check it out.\n\n79\n00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:28.060\nAll right, if we go to Tools and,\nevidently I'm not on the right machine,\n\n80\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.712\nI'm on server one, so\nlet's switch over to my domain controller.\n\n81\n00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:32.604\n&gt;&gt; The one that's running DNS.\n\n82\n00:03:32.604 --> 00:03:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, having DNS running makes it\neasier to open up the DNS console.\n\n83\n00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.370\nAnd if we take a look at the properties,\nnot of my zone right.\n\n84\n00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.300\nNot any one of my zones but of the server\nitself this is a server level property.\n\n85\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.270\nWe're gonna see a tab known\nas the root hints, all right?\n\n86\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.060\nOr a tab called root hints, known as.\n\n87\n00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.280\nAnd in here, there they are, I think\nCherokee you mentioned the other day\n\n88\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.520\nthat there were 13 root servers, right,\nA through M is how they're designated.\n\n89\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.463\nAnd there they are, A through M,\nand their IP addresses.\n\n90\n00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:04.734\nKeep in mind, which also I think\nCherokee also pointed out,\n\n91\n00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:07.540\nthat's not thirteen individual\nservers sitting out there.\n\n92\n00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.570\nEach one, A, this one IP address,\n\n93\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.840\nis actually a big farm of servers\nprobably geographically distributed.\n\n94\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.132\nAnd they're doing load balancing and other\ntechniques, that's the IP address that we\n\n95\n00:04:19.132 --> 00:04:22.902\ninitialize the connection with, but\nthere's not one server known as A, and\n\n96\n00:04:22.902 --> 00:04:26.160\nif I knock that over and\nunplug it that whole thing is down, right?\n\n97\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.320\n&gt;&gt; So it's not end of the world there.\n\n98\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, it would be too easy\nif there were just 13 little Dell\n\n99\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.440\n740s hosting each one of these.\n\n100\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.370\nI could take those out\nit's pretty darn quick.\n\n101\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.390\nAnd the Internet would stop, right?\n\n102\n00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.390\nWithout the root,\nwant to understand, without the top\n\n103\n00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.140\nI can't resolve any external names\nbecause I can't start in the middle.\n\n104\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.880\nI have to go to the root\nto figure out where the TLD\n\n105\n00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.140\nis to figure out where\nthe authoritative server is.\n\n106\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.880\nSo, you have be able to\nstart there at the top.\n\n107\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.083\nSo, where did this come from?\n\n108\n00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:57.450\nWell, they came from Microsoft.\n\n109\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.750\nWell yeah, they came from Microsoft.\n\n110\n00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.100\nThis lists it,\nnot the root servers, right?\n\n111\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.240\nAnd when you install DNS,\nit loads up this file cache.dns and\n\n112\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.480\nit has the IP addresses\nof the root servers.\n\n113\n00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:20.525\nIf we look in our, lets say seek\nall windows, test me system 32 DNS.\n\n114\n00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:22.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.831\n&gt;&gt; So it's good there.\n\n116\n00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:27.187\n&gt;&gt; DNS there we go there is cache.dns,\nif I was showing\n\n117\n00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:32.660\nextensions it's actually a .dns file\n&gt;&gt; You can see I've opened it up before so\n\n118\n00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.280\nNotePad is associated with it.\n\n119\n00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.514\nYour computer's going to go hey,\nwhat do you want to use to open this file.\n\n120\n00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:39.230\nUse your favorite text editor.\n\n121\n00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.280\nAnd in here, here's where it's\ngetting those IP addresses from.\n\n122\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.336\nRight?\nThere's A.\n\n123\n00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:47.770\nIt tells you who it maintains it,\nor some information.\n\n124\n00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.910\nLooks like I got their old names here,\nactually.\n\n125\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.728\n&gt;&gt; You can also go on what is it if\nthere is a website I can't remember.\n\n126\n00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:54.861\n&gt;&gt; I can't think of the names.\n\n127\n00:05:54.861 --> 00:05:57.988\n&gt;&gt; I think it's route-servers.org.\n\n128\n00:05:57.988 --> 00:06:01.404\n&gt;&gt; There is a couple of cool sites out\nthere you an actually see where at least\n\n129\n00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:02.981\nthe main point of those guys are.\n\n130\n00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:05.250\nBut as you can see,\nVerisign operates some.\n\n131\n00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.440\nThere's some operated\nby our local military.\n\n132\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.844\nICAN-\n&gt;&gt; Universities, NASA.\n\n133\n00:06:10.844 --> 00:06:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Some universities, yep.\n\n134\n00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.040\nSo few different people\nhelp maintain this.\n\n135\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.080\nAnd this file, this is what gets\nloaded up into those properties.\n\n136\n00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.875\nWhen we start up our DNS server,\nit reads that file and\n\n137\n00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:23.470\npre-loads them into the cache.\n\n138\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.920\nRemember how we flushed the cache and yet\nyou still saw the route servers in there?\n\n139\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.130\nThat's because it's loading those up\nas soon as we start the DNS service so\n\n140\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.690\nthat it can now go and\n\n141\n00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.240\ntalk to the route servers if\nyou're resolving external names.\n\n142\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.740\nAlright.\n\n143\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.970\nThat file again gets loaded into here.\n\n144\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.650\nNow you can edit the file manually,\nnot recommend it,\n\n145\n00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.970\nbecause you make some changes in the\nsyntax, a semicolon, something like that.\n\n146\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.170\nAnd you can prevent your server from\nbeing able to reach the roots and\n\n147\n00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.000\nresolve external names.\n\n148\n00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.935\nBut that being said, there might\nbe times when you don't want to\n\n149\n00:06:56.935 --> 00:07:00.060\nbe able to resolve external names, right?\n\n150\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.080\nOne way to do that is to\nremove your root hints.\n\n151\n00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.460\nBecause if my server cannot\nresolve external names,\n\n152\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.780\nif it can't reach the root,\nit won't be able to resolve names.\n\n153\n00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.875\nShould we try it?\n\n154\n00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.830\nAre we feeling brave?\n\n155\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.637\n&gt;&gt; You got a check point on this machine.\n\n156\n00:07:14.637 --> 00:07:18.437\n&gt;&gt; See if I can, no,\nI gotta remove one at a time.\n\n157\n00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:25.110\nSo take my word for it, if these weren't\nin here, I guess we could What the heck.\n\n158\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.000\nThere we go.\n\n159\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.930\nThat worked.\n\n160\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.860\nAll right, how's this?\n\n161\n00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.462\nYou are about to remove\nthe last root hint.\n\n162\n00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:33.557\nIf the DNS server is not authoritative for\nthe root, and is not configured for\n\n163\n00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:37.148\nexclusive forwarding, you might\nnot be able to resolve queries for\n\n164\n00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:38.780\nexternal names.\n\n165\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.972\nYes I wanna continue, because I don't know\nI like to just click things and do things.\n\n166\n00:07:42.972 --> 00:07:44.500\nNo I'm kidding.\n\n167\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.584\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're not doing\nthis on a production.\n\n168\n00:07:46.584 --> 00:07:47.273\n&gt;&gt; Yeah this is definitely not production.\n\n169\n00:07:47.273 --> 00:07:49.501\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat definitely makes the difference.\n\n170\n00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:53.564\n&gt;&gt; All right let's take a look at my\nscreen here and let's ping google.com.\n\n171\n00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.876\nIt didn't work.\n\n172\n00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:57.279\nI probably still have that cache.\n\n173\n00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.946\n&gt;&gt; The cache.\n&gt;&gt; Cache yeah let's flush,\n\n174\n00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:01.650\nthat's not an administrative\ncommand prompt either.\n\n175\n00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:06.282\nLet's Let's check the cache.\n\n176\n00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:08.210\nAnd sure enough,\nI've still got this cached.\n\n177\n00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.320\nSo let's clear that cache.\n\n178\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.040\nAll right.\n\n179\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.960\nAnd let's flush my local cache,\nor my DNS Client Resolver Cache.\n\n180\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.520\nFlush DNS, all right, now we're all clear.\n\n181\n00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.650\nLet's ping Google.com.\n\n182\n00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.680\nNotice it says,\nI can't find the host google.com.\n\n183\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.550\nI cannot turn that name\ninto an IP address.\n\n184\n00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.320\nCuz I looked in my zone file,\nI don't have a zone file for google.com.\n\n185\n00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.760\nAnd I can't find the top of the structure,\nyou took away all my roots.\n\n186\n00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.800\nSo I'm sorry, I can't help you, right?\n\n187\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.570\nIn a high security, in a test environment,\nsomething like that,\n\n188\n00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.160\nmaybe you want that result, right?\n\n189\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.710\nMaybe you want to remove those\nroot hints for that reason.\n\n190\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:53.980\nNow if I restart my DNS server, we should\nbe able to load that file right back up.\n\n191\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:59.040\nLet's find out let's go to my properties\nand we are gonna to root hands and\n\n192\n00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.910\nit's still not there so\nlet's add let's do this.\n\n193\n00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:14.240\nCopy these from 10.10.8202 is one that\nI think has got them, there we go.\n\n194\n00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.370\nI just hit one of my other DNS servers\nreal quick to repopulate that list.\n\n195\n00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.250\nThought if I restarted,\nit would put them back.\n\n196\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.830\nBut evidently,\nI was incorrect in that assumption.\n\n197\n00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.370\nSo keep that in mind Lauren.\n\n198\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.510\nFrom what I just showed you, if you go and\ndelete these and then restart it.\n\n199\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.580\nIt might or might not come back up.\n\n200\n00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.220\nI want to say eventually it will.\n\n201\n00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.380\n&gt;&gt; But it is, it's kind of strange how\nsome are and some are not there, so.\n\n202\n00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some are known, some are unknown.\n\n203\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.290\nEventually everything will flush out.\n\n204\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.530\nThere we go and\neverything should be back to normal.\n\n205\n00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.930\nYou can remove all those and add your own.\n\n206\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.470\nLike I know some places where you don't\nwant any external name resolution\n\n207\n00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.030\nI remove all those servers and\nI designate one of my servers.\n\n208\n00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.820\nMy local DNS servers as the root, because\nthat's the only names it needs to resolve\n\n209\n00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.930\nare local names so you might put your\nown servers IP address in there.\n\n210\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.060\nThat's what these add, and edit,\nand remove buttons are for.\n\n211\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.600\nIf the root servers IP\naddresses ever change,\n\n212\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.250\nthat comes through Windows Updates.\n\n213\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.690\nSo our DNS server gets updated\nthrough Windows Update, so\n\n214\n00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.560\nif any changes occur,\nwe can get them from there, all right?\n\n215\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.530\nNow another interesting\nthing you can do is this.\n\n216\n00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.370\nI could, another way to prevent\nexternal name resolution\n\n217\n00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.990\nis create a new zone on your DNS server.\n\n218\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.550\nGonna create a primary zone, and\n\n219\n00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.990\nI'll replicate all my DNS domain\ncontrollers in my domain and my root name.\n\n220\n00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.129\nCan you see that out there in T.V. land?\n\n221\n00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:37.740\nDot.\nRemember what we said,\n\n222\n00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.270\nthe variant of an FQDN there's a period\ndot com dot that represents the root.\n\n223\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.090\nThat is the top zone.\n\n224\n00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.570\nI'll click next.\n\n225\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.460\nIt doesn't really matter about updates\nbecause no ones going in there.\n\n226\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.780\nNow we've got a zone called root so\n\n227\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.910\neven though I've got root,\nping google.com.\n\n228\n00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.700\nNotice it's not going to go out.\n\n229\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.520\nDNS both the server and\nthe client resolver always try\n\n230\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.270\nlocal first because that is the fastest\nway to get the response, so it says wait.\n\n231\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.200\nI've got a zone.\n\n232\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.580\nI see this root and IP addresses but\nI've got a zone root.\n\n233\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.530\nI am root.\n\n234\n00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.280\nAll right,\nit's what he's thinking to himself.\n\n235\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.770\n&gt;&gt; I am Groot.\n\n236\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.676\n&gt;&gt; I am root.\n\n237\n00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:20.379\nI am on top.\n\n238\n00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:23.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if I'm the top [LAUGH].\n\n239\n00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.780\n&gt;&gt; You didn't like my joke?\n\n240\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.130\nI am Groot.\n\n241\n00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.310\nGroot.\nI don't know Groot.\n\n242\n00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.060\n&gt;&gt; Shut up.\n\n243\n00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.900\n&gt;&gt; No, noshould I know Groot?\n\n244\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.130\n&gt;&gt; My gosh [LAUGH].\n\n245\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.178\n&gt;&gt; Is that a form of root with a [LAUGH].\n\n246\n00:11:33.178 --> 00:11:33.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Marvel.\n\n247\n00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.660\nThe little tree.\n\n248\n00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.290\n&gt;&gt; The little tree in Marvel?\n\n249\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.440\n&gt;&gt; Guardian's of the Galaxy Mike.\n\n250\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'm just pulling\n\n251\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.945\nyour nerd card right now.\n\n252\n00:11:42.945 --> 00:11:46.260\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay I guess so I've seen it once and\n\n253\n00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.590\nI didn't remember the tree's name [LAUGH].\n\n254\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n255\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.111\n&gt;&gt; Groot now I remember.\n\n256\n00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:53.125\nOkay.\n[LAUGH] I'm telling you\n\n257\n00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:54.465\nI'm a David Attenborough fan.\n\n258\n00:11:54.465 --> 00:11:57.193\nI watch Discovery and\nI'm about that all day long.\n\n259\n00:11:57.193 --> 00:11:58.835\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n260\n00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:01.305\nBut enough about my TV browsing habits.\n\n261\n00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:04.435\nSo you see even though\nI've got the root hints,\n\n262\n00:12:04.435 --> 00:12:07.965\nbecause I've got the zone called ROOT\nmy server assumes this at the very top,\n\n263\n00:12:07.965 --> 00:12:10.925\nand it says there is nobody higher to ask.\n\n264\n00:12:10.925 --> 00:12:12.265\nI know everything.\n\n265\n00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:15.520\nI should have everything, so\nthis is all the reason in the entire world\n\n266\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.510\nIs what I've got according to\nthis DNS Server, all right?\n\n267\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.890\nAnd this was a common issue way back when.\n\n268\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.170\nIt's not anymore.\n\n269\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.150\nBut back then, I think it was 2000 Server.\n\n270\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.090\nIf you weren't connected to the Internet\nwhen you set up your DNS Server,\n\n271\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.070\nit couldn't reach out and find root.\n\n272\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.110\nSo it assumed it was root, and\nit created zone root zone.\n\n273\n00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.560\nAnd it had to remember to go back and\n\n274\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.660\ndelete that after you set up your\nDNS Server and gave it Internet access.\n\n275\n00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.190\nIt was crazy, but that doesn't\nhappen anymore, I don't think.\n\n276\n00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.150\nBut something to check for.\n\n277\n00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.730\nAll right, let me bring,\nlet me get rid of that root zone, so\n\n278\n00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.220\nthat we are not the top anymore.\n\n279\n00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.590\nRight.\n\n280\n00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.390\nTells me are you sure you wanna remove it?\n\n281\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.910\nIt also tells me hey you've removed root,\n\n282\n00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.160\nthat means you're gonna need\nroot tense if you wanna resolve.\n\n283\n00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.890\nAnd I can say yes.\n\n284\n00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.840\nAnd it's gonna repopulate it if I had\nactually removed them which we didn't.\n\n285\n00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.490\nAll right?\n\n286\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.790\nAnd now I should be able to ping\ngoogle.com with no problem.\n\n287\n00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.020\nActually that's a great\nlittle thing to show you.\n\n288\n00:13:16.705 --> 00:13:17.445\nLet's talk about that.\n\n289\n00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:21.485\nI ws going to wait a little bit later but\nit would probably be a good spot.\n\n290\n00:13:21.485 --> 00:13:22.130\nNo let's not.\n\n291\n00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.245\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're just\nteasing us at this point.\n\n292\n00:13:25.245 --> 00:13:26.625\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI'm going to hold onto it.\n\n293\n00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:28.865\nThere's a reason that's not working but\n\n294\n00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:31.835\nI don't want to give\naway the secret just yet.\n\n295\n00:13:31.835 --> 00:13:37.514\nIf we ping anything else like amazon.com.\n\n296\n00:13:39.587 --> 00:13:42.100\nIt's been a little slow.\n\n297\n00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:46.160\nIt's being really slow actually.\n\n298\n00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.012\nAll right, let's ping,\nwhat something else I can ping?\n\n299\n00:13:51.012 --> 00:13:53.120\nMicrosoft.com.\n\n300\n00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.400\n&gt;&gt; Zappos.com\n&gt;&gt; My whole machine is just all of\n\n301\n00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.940\na sudden really slow.\n\n302\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.260\nInteresting.\n\n303\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.620\nI've broke it.\n\n304\n00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.440\nNow I've done it.\n\n305\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.230\nJust make sure we still\nhave network access.\n\n306\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; We are good there.\n\n307\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.028\nZappos.\n\n308\n00:14:11.028 --> 00:14:13.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n309\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.410\nit's actually not resolving any names.\n\n310\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.480\nMy root hints are back.\n\n311\n00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.910\nYou know what I'm going to do?\n\n312\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.042\nReal quick.\nBecause I reloaded those root hints and I\n\n313\n00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:26.770\ndeleted that zone, I'm going to restart my\nDNS server which is probably the problem.\n\n314\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.440\nLet's just restart that real quick.\n\n315\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.820\nI was messing around with telling\nyou you're the top of the entire DNS\n\n316\n00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.270\nstructure-\n&gt;&gt; You're playing with it's\n\n317\n00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.200\nemotions, Mike.\n\n318\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.110\n&gt;&gt; I was.\n\n319\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.900\nStripped it away,\ntook it away without asking.\n\n320\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.990\nSo my DNS server is probably\na little upset with me.\n\n321\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:42.540\nLet's see how we go now.\n\n322\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.180\nStill having a few issues.\n\n323\n00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.290\nResolving external m's.\n\n324\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.138\nThat is interesting.\n\n325\n00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:53.720\n[INAUDIBLE] Let's try local\nmachine here real quick.\n\n326\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.380\nSo it's responding to that just fine.\n\n327\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.580\nSo my external names.\n\n328\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.440\nSo let's troubleshoot that.\n\n329\n00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.400\nLet's figure out what's going on here.\n\n330\n00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.830\nCached lookups.\n\n331\n00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.250\nNothing cached in there.\n\n332\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.620\nWe're gonna take a look\nat my servers properties.\n\n333\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.950\nTake a look at my root hints.\n\n334\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.830\nAnd they are all reloaded,\nso we're good there.\n\n335\n00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.490\nI just don't know if those\nare the most current.\n\n336\n00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.570\nI did reload them from that other server.\n\n337\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.730\nShould be good to go though.\n\n338\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.870\nI'll tell you what let's flush.\n\n339\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.930\nI'm going to clear this cache.\n\n340\n00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.764\nAnd I'm going to clear my\nlocal cache real quick.\n\n341\n00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:39.370\nAll right we got it back I think.\n\n342\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.450\nSo let me show you guys what I was doing,\ncuz I know sometimes the troubleshooting\n\n343\n00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.070\nis just as good as\nthe lessons we teach you.\n\n344\n00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.290\nSo lets take a look at my screen here,\n\n345\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:51.060\nI got it fixed and as you've seen I was\nhaving troubles resolving external names\n\n346\n00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.930\nright after I made that,\nI removed all the root hints.\n\n347\n00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.214\nTo show you how that would\nprevent external name resolution.\n\n348\n00:15:58.214 --> 00:16:01.494\nWe put them back and I still didn't\nhave external name resolution.\n\n349\n00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:02.671\nSo, I did a little troubleshooting there.\n\n350\n00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:05.694\nI could still ping things by IP address,\nright,\n\n351\n00:16:05.694 --> 00:16:09.181\nOne of the tests I did was\nping something external to me.\n\n352\n00:16:09.181 --> 00:16:10.699\nI used 8.8.8.8.\n\n353\n00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:15.827\nOne of Google's DNS servers and\nI also used 4221, 4.2.2.1.\n\n354\n00:16:15.827 --> 00:16:18.960\nI think it's a Verizon DNS server\nup around LAN or something.\n\n355\n00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.248\nBut anyway I could ping out my IP\naddress which was telling me my network\n\n356\n00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:23.940\nconnectivity was fine.\n\n357\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.110\nAnd I was able to resolve local names.\n\n358\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:32.410\nSo my DNS server service was running fine,\nand it was just not able to\n\n359\n00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.830\nget to the top and work its way\ndown to resolve external names.\n\n360\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.930\nRestarted the DNS server a couple times.\n\n361\n00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:44.408\nIt did not seem to reload\nmy cache.dns properly,\n\n362\n00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:45.970\nI reloaded it from another server.\n\n363\n00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.610\nIf you look at my screen here,\nI've got copy from server.\n\n364\n00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.810\nI did that, copied them over from another\nDNS server that I hadn't messed with.\n\n365\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.450\nAnd it populated this but\nyou see these guys down here.\n\n366\n00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.680\nI don't know if I can't\nmake that any wider.\n\n367\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.060\nSome of these root servers\ndown here are unknown.\n\n368\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.902\nSome of them having a V4 and\na V6 address listed there.\n\n369\n00:17:05.902 --> 00:17:11.880\nAnd so all I did was start going down this\nlist and like choosing this one, and Edit.\n\n370\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.260\nLet me see what's going on with\nthis particular root zone record.\n\n371\n00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.950\nI've got no IP address, clicked Resolve.\n\n372\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.750\nAnd it was able to pull the IP address for\n\n373\n00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.530\nthat particular route server,\nvalidate it, and that one's good.\n\n374\n00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.150\nAnd I just started going down the list,\nright?\n\n375\n00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.880\nI grabbed the next one, Edit.\n\n376\n00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.900\nI removed any entries\nthat were in there and\n\n377\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.480\njust made it resolve it again, and\nit seems to be working just fine.\n\n378\n00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.115\nSo a little less scary, yeah.\n\n379\n00:17:39.115 --> 00:17:43.210\n[LAUGH] Like this one seems to be taking a\nwhile but there it goes, it populated in.\n\n380\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:48.240\nSo what I need to do is just kinda work\nway down through each one of these.\n\n381\n00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.360\nIt very well could be a time thing, right.\n\n382\n00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.399\nLike I see the IP address is already\nin here and it says it's validating but\n\n383\n00:17:56.399 --> 00:18:01.700\nif I remove it and tell to validate it\nagain, it seems to happen a lot quicker.\n\n384\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.840\nSo something might be hung up,\n\n385\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.020\nI don't know what exactly was\ngoing on behind the scenes there.\n\n386\n00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.980\nBut if you run into that issue this\nmight be something you would try\n\n387\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.000\nis pull up the individual root server.\n\n388\n00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.670\nEdit, remove any existing\nIP information for\n\n389\n00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.120\nthe route server and\ntell it to go get it again.\n\n390\n00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.760\nAnd it's just gonna reach\nout to Microsoft and\n\n391\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.430\ngrab those IP addresses or\nI assume that's what it's doing.\n\n392\n00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.073\nWhich is it's just like well,\nwait, you don't have resolution,\n\n393\n00:18:31.073 --> 00:18:32.950\nhow is this working?\n\n394\n00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.170\nSo I'd have to be a little more looking as\nhow this is actually fixing my problem.\n\n395\n00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.750\nWhether it's hitting the root file,\ngetting the IP address ,and then just\n\n396\n00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.000\ntesting it to make sure the IP address\nresponds and then saying, okay?\n\n397\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.960\nOr whether it's reaching out and talking\nto Microsoft through Microsoft update.\n\n398\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.920\nAnd pulling in the latest IP address for\nthat particular root server.\n\n399\n00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.880\nSo a lot of the others happening there,\nbut it is fixing the problem.\n\n400\n00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.540\nAnd I think I just have a couple more to\ngo, so let me go ahead and finish this up.\n\n401\n00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.430\nReally, with one or\ntwo root servers I would be fine, right?\n\n402\n00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:07.030\nI don't have to fix all of these\nright now, but I don't like looking\n\n403\n00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:11.330\nat windows that have issues in them,\nso I'm going to let that one validate.\n\n404\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.000\nWe're gonna grab this one,\nand resolve that one.\n\n405\n00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.084\nI just got a couple more to do here.\n\n406\n00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:26.349\nAnd this one I am going to edit and remove\nthose existing ones and then resolve it.\n\n407\n00:19:26.349 --> 00:19:30.030\nAnd what you see is it comes back to\nexact same address that I just removed.\n\n408\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.260\nSo something again was\ngetting hung up in there and\n\n409\n00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.860\nit is taking a sweet time validating but\nI think we're good to go.\n\n410\n00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.314\nNow everything seems to be fine\nexcept maybe for this one.\n\n411\n00:19:41.314 --> 00:19:43.011\nSo we'll finish that up.\n\n412\n00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:44.200\nWe'll let that resolve.\n\n413\n00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.284\nThat one seems to be a little slow.\n\n414\n00:19:47.284 --> 00:19:47.934\nBut I'm okay.\n\n415\n00:19:47.934 --> 00:19:48.863\nI'm gonna go ahead and click OK.\n\n416\n00:19:48.863 --> 00:19:50.710\nSo at least you get to see that problem.\n\n417\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:55.730\nAnd now to come back over here,\nping google.com, we're back in business.\n\n418\n00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.963\nSo a little bit of troubleshooting for\nyou guys out there and gals, in case\n\n419\n00:19:58.963 --> 00:20:02.738\nsomething happens to your DNS server and\nyou're not able to resolve external names.\n\n420\n00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:03.813\n&gt;&gt; There's no need to panic now.\n\n421\n00:20:03.813 --> 00:20:04.333\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's right.\n\n422\n00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:05.237\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n423\n00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:06.973\n&gt;&gt; And go take a look at that.\n\n424\n00:20:06.973 --> 00:20:09.300\nAll right, I don't know why I closed that.\n\n425\n00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.880\nSo back to where we were before\nI broke everything, right?\n\n426\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.060\nSetting up a root zone on your\nDNS server can definitely\n\n427\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.010\nprevent external name resolution.\n\n428\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.510\nIt might prevent for\nlonger than you care to.\n\n429\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.530\nSo now we know how to fix that.\n\n430\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.853\nWhat else?\n\n431\n00:20:23.853 --> 00:20:24.945\nWe talked about the root.\n\n432\n00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:30.180\nSo the next thing I wanna talk about is\nsomething known as forwarding, right?\n\n433\n00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.540\nWe've got forwarding and\n\n434\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.490\nwe got conditional forwarding,\nmake sure you separate the two,\n\n435\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.400\ncuz they are two different things\nthat we're going to talk about here.\n\n436\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.809\nForwarding is when I\ntell my DNS server to,\n\n437\n00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:47.505\ninstead of try to answer the question,\nforward it on to somebody else.\n\n438\n00:20:47.505 --> 00:20:48.863\nLet somebody else do it.\n\n439\n00:20:48.863 --> 00:20:53.870\nNow somebody comes up and asks me,\nhey, what is an IPv6 address?\n\n440\n00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:57.490\nAnd I say, hm, Cherokee,\nwhat is an IPV6 address, right?\n\n441\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.730\nI just forwarded that question on to her.\n\n442\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.200\nAnd now, since she's the IPV6 expert,\nshe can answer that question.\n\n443\n00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.450\nThat's really what's going on with DNS,\nright?\n\n444\n00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.570\nYou're just forwarding\nthe query to somebody else.\n\n445\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:15.468\nSo like my DNS server, for example, is\nauthoritative for my domain, lab.itpro.tv.\n\n446\n00:21:15.468 --> 00:21:18.955\nWhen it wants to resolve an external name,\nit goes to the root and\n\n447\n00:21:18.955 --> 00:21:20.064\nworks its way down.\n\n448\n00:21:20.064 --> 00:21:24.240\nWhat I could do though is tell my\nserver hey, anything you don't know and\n\n449\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.783\nthe only thing it knows is lab.itpro.tv.\n\n450\n00:21:26.783 --> 00:21:30.413\nAnything you don't know,\nforward it onto this other DNS server and\n\n451\n00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:31.566\nlet them do the work.\n\n452\n00:21:31.566 --> 00:21:36.947\nLet me show you a diagram so we can kinda\nmentally picture what's going on here and\n\n453\n00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:38.778\nthen we'll configure it.\n\n454\n00:21:38.778 --> 00:21:40.236\nAnd I forgot,\nCherokee did this the last time.\n\n455\n00:21:40.236 --> 00:21:41.355\n&gt;&gt; Which one it is?\n\n456\n00:21:41.355 --> 00:21:43.043\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's not that one.\n\n457\n00:21:43.043 --> 00:21:44.471\n&gt;&gt; We already saw that one.\n\n458\n00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:45.795\n&gt;&gt; It's.\n\n459\n00:21:47.287 --> 00:21:47.939\n&gt;&gt; We should play a game here.\n\n460\n00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:48.753\n&gt;&gt; Let's see here.\n\n461\n00:21:48.753 --> 00:21:50.956\nI know, I really should name them\na little more appropriately.\n\n462\n00:21:50.956 --> 00:21:52.875\nIt would help.\n\n463\n00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:54.714\nBut this is the one that's\ngot forwarding on it.\n\n464\n00:21:54.714 --> 00:21:56.944\nWe used the internal and\nexternal in another episode.\n\n465\n00:21:56.944 --> 00:21:59.010\nNow we're gonna take\na look at forwarding here.\n\n466\n00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.750\nAnd I'll zoom out just a little bit so\nwe can fit this whole thing on here.\n\n467\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.230\nApologize for the resolution.\n\n468\n00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.330\nHopefully you guys yeah,\nthat looks good, doesn't it?\n\n469\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.604\nAll right so forwarding,\nhere's my little domain over here, and\n\n470\n00:22:11.604 --> 00:22:13.834\nlet's just zoom into this area for\na second.\n\n471\n00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:18.782\nSo here's my little domain,\nright, ITPro.TV's DNS server.\n\n472\n00:22:18.782 --> 00:22:22.681\nI've got a client, he sends a query\nover to my local DNS server,\n\n473\n00:22:22.681 --> 00:22:26.890\nright with those TCP IP settings,\ntell him to send everything here.\n\n474\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:31.540\nAnd what's going to happen is when\nthat DNS server gets that query for\n\n475\n00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.068\nan external name and\nI've configured forwarding,\n\n476\n00:22:35.068 --> 00:22:40.460\nit instead of going to the route, like\nwe did with our externaling resolution.\n\n477\n00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.080\nIf you remember over here,\nI sent the query to my local DNS server.\n\n478\n00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:50.040\nMy DNS server then went to the route, and\nthen to the TLD, the top level domain and\n\n479\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.330\nthen to the authoritative DNS server,\nand got the answer.\n\n480\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:23:00.140\nRemember, my client sent a recursive query\nwhich requires an answer to my DNS server.\n\n481\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.530\nMy DNS server sent iterative\nqueries to the root, the TLD,\n\n482\n00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.210\nand Microsoft to either get an answer or\n\n483\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.520\na referral to somebody else that\nmight know to finally get the answer.\n\n484\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.840\nWhen we look at forwarding my DNS\nserver now instead of hitting the root\n\n485\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.400\nis just going to forward it\non to another DNS server.\n\n486\n00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.078\nAnd we pick which DNS server,\n\n487\n00:23:21.078 --> 00:23:24.175\nwe tell it what IP address\nto forward those queries to.\n\n488\n00:23:24.175 --> 00:23:26.014\nNotice the arrow is red, right?\n\n489\n00:23:26.014 --> 00:23:29.004\nAnd I think my key is up here,\nred is recursive, so\n\n490\n00:23:29.004 --> 00:23:34.080\nit's not just sending an iterative query\nsaying, hey, do you know the IP address?\n\n491\n00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.940\nOr can you point me to somebody else that\ndoes like DNS normally does when it's\n\n492\n00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.270\ndealing with external DNS servers.\n\n493\n00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.752\nIt's saying hey,\nhere's a question that somebody asked me.\n\n494\n00:23:44.752 --> 00:23:48.950\nYou go deal with it and I'll sit here and\nwait until you get the answer.\n\n495\n00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:53.306\nAnd the server that you forwarded it to\nthen goes through the process of going to\n\n496\n00:23:53.306 --> 00:23:58.005\nthe root, the TLD, and finally to the\nauthoritative server, getting a response.\n\n497\n00:23:58.005 --> 00:24:04.022\nAnd then sending it back to my DNS server,\nwho then replies to my DNS client, right?\n\n498\n00:24:04.022 --> 00:24:06.113\nSo that's the idea behind forwarding.\n\n499\n00:24:06.113 --> 00:24:07.733\nIt's forwarded on to somebody else.\n\n500\n00:24:07.733 --> 00:24:12.472\nAnd let them do all the work, that way,\nyour DNS servers can do what it does best,\n\n501\n00:24:12.472 --> 00:24:15.990\nresolve local names,\nright internal names for my domain.\n\n502\n00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:20.680\nAnd that's really one of the big reasons\nwe would use something like this\n\n503\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.920\nis to offload some of the work\nfrom my local DNS server.\n\n504\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.140\nAnd typically we'll use it\nlike my ISP's DNS server.\n\n505\n00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.640\nYou think about your ISP,\nyour internet service provider, and\n\n506\n00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.380\nthey've got thousands and\nthousands of clients.\n\n507\n00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.510\nThey have the backbone right?\n\n508\n00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.440\nThey're probably connected to\nthe backbone of the internet.\n\n509\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.720\nThey've got big bad DNS servers.\n\n510\n00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.080\nAnd those servers\nare caching responses for\n\n511\n00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.930\nall of their clients\nthat they're servicing.\n\n512\n00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.980\nSo the cache on those DNS servers is\ngonna have a lot of information in there.\n\n513\n00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:55.030\nSo by forwarding it on to them,\nI get a couple of benefits.\n\n514\n00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.250\nI let their servers do the work.\n\n515\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.400\nMy DNS server is not doing\nall of the heavy lifting.\n\n516\n00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.280\nTheir DNS servers are beefy, hopefully.\n\n517\n00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.882\nI know some ISPs might not be.\n\n518\n00:25:03.882 --> 00:25:04.394\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n519\n00:25:04.394 --> 00:25:05.640\n&gt;&gt; But they've got big,\n\n520\n00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.430\nbad beefy DNS servers that\nare connected to the backbone.\n\n521\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.100\nAnd they've got the bandwidth,\nand they've got a huge cache.\n\n522\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.020\nSo there's a good chance that\nthe DNS server from a ISP\n\n523\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.985\nalready knows the IP\naddress I'm looking for.\n\n524\n00:25:15.985 --> 00:25:20.540\nBecause one of their other thousands of\nclients has gone to that site recently and\n\n525\n00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.180\nit's cached.\n\n526\n00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.420\nSo we'll just forward it onto them, right?\n\n527\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.080\nForward it onto your ISP's DNS.\n\n528\n00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.590\nAnother scenario where we might see\nforwarding is internally, right?\n\n529\n00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:38.730\nI might have a scenario like this where I\nhave multiple servers within my domain.\n\n530\n00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:42.580\nAnd I have only one DNS server I wanna\nuse for external name resolution.\n\n531\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.370\nAll right, these servers in here,\n\n532\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.650\nI want them primarily to support the\nthousands of internal clients that I have.\n\n533\n00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.020\nAnd I wanna make sure my DNS\nresponse times are quick.\n\n534\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.810\nSo I've said, you know what,\nyou guys don't worry about\n\n535\n00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:58.360\nexternal name resolution,\njust do internal name resolution.\n\n536\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.170\nAnything that's external\nforward it over to\n\n537\n00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.100\nthis over DNS server that I maintain,\nright?\n\n538\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:03.890\nThis is not the ISP.\n\n539\n00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:05.710\nThis is my DNS server.\n\n540\n00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.410\nAnd let this DNS server do all\nthe external name resolution.\n\n541\n00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.100\nSo now I'm segregating the work, right?\n\n542\n00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.790\nI've got some DNS servers that are\nfocusing in on internal name resolution.\n\n543\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:15.520\nI've got one or\n\n544\n00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.440\nmore DNS servers that I forward to that\nare doing my external name resolution.\n\n545\n00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.840\nAnd in a scenario like this, it might\nbe maybe the servers not in front but\n\n546\n00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.420\nbehind the firewall.\n\n547\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.220\nBut he might be the only one that's\nallowed to go through the firewall to do\n\n548\n00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.580\nexternal name resolution.\n\n549\n00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.240\nRight?\n\n550\n00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.000\nOr this guy might be out in my DMZ but\neither way,\n\n551\n00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.370\nall external name resolution is getting\nfunneled through that one DNS server.\n\n552\n00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.720\nWhich means this cash is gonna\nhave everything that all my users\n\n553\n00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.820\nare resolving.\n\n554\n00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.040\nAnd most of my users go to the same sites.\n\n555\n00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.530\nRight, they are using the same kind of\nresources connecting to the same business\n\n556\n00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:51.530\npartners.\n\n557\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:56.290\nSo by doing that rather than splitting\ncash across two machines you might\n\n558\n00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.728\nbe talking of the DNS server\nthat's cached it, you might not.\n\n559\n00:26:58.728 --> 00:27:01.300\nAll the cache is now\nkind of right here and\n\n560\n00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.435\nit becomes that central repository for\nthe cache.\n\n561\n00:27:03.435 --> 00:27:05.430\n[COUGH] Excuse me so\n\n562\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:11.680\nthat's another scenario where we\nmight see forwarding implemented.\n\n563\n00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.110\nAll right Cherokee, let's check it out,\nlet's see how we can do that.\n\n564\n00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:19.710\nSo I am on,\nlet's make sure we're on the right server.\n\n565\n00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:23.940\nI'm on DCO1 and right now DCO1\ncan resolves external names.\n\n566\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.954\nRight, google.com because we\nfixed our root server issue.\n\n567\n00:27:26.954 --> 00:27:28.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, everything is fine there.\n\n568\n00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n569\n00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, but at this point my server\nis going to the root to the TLD and\n\n570\n00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.470\ndoing all the work for\nthose external resolutions.\n\n571\n00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:42.470\nSo, what I'm gonna do I'm going to come in\nhere to the properties of my DNS server.\n\n572\n00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.190\nOkay?\n\n573\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.160\nAnd I'm gonna go to the forwarder's tab.\n\n574\n00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.340\nForwarders or DNS server that the server\ncan use to resolve DNS queries for\n\n575\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.870\nrecords that this server cannot resolve.\n\n576\n00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.415\nAgain, I'm only responsible for\n\n577\n00:27:52.415 --> 00:27:56.110\nITPRO.TV that's the only record\nI have on this DNS server.\n\n578\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:28:01.950\nSo, we gonna to set up a forwarder we\ngonna click edit And then we're gonna\n\n579\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.140\ntype in an IP address of an external DNS\nserver, let's forward it out to Google.\n\n580\n00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.800\nThey've got big bad beefy DNS servers,\n\n581\n00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.900\nI'm sure they won't mind\na couple extra queries.\n\n582\n00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.560\nAnd so there we go, I put in the IP\naddress, it'll attempt to resolve it.\n\n583\n00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.320\nBut I've already got my green up,\nthere it goes, it got the name.\n\n584\n00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.720\nAnd then we'll click okay.\n\n585\n00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.850\nAnd now I've got a forwarder, right?\n\n586\n00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.630\nNow once you set up\nthe forwarder it's gonna work\n\n587\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.150\nlike I just showed you in that diagram.\n\n588\n00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:30.110\nExternal names, anything that this server\ndoes not know it's just gonna forward it\n\n589\n00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.350\non to the other disk DNS\nserver that I specified.\n\n590\n00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.400\nAnd let them do the work and\nwait for the response.\n\n591\n00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.500\nWhat if this server's not responding?\n\n592\n00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.410\nAll right.\n\n593\n00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.180\nWhat if I've tried to forward\nthe query over to that DNS server, but\n\n594\n00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.090\nthe DNS server was not there.\n\n595\n00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.720\nAll right.\n\n596\n00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.360\nBecause it's down, you know,\nwhatever the case may be unavailable.\n\n597\n00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.430\nWith this check mark,\nchecked, use root hints if\n\n598\n00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:58.090\nno forwarders are available, I'll still\nbe able to resolve external names.\n\n599\n00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:02.340\nWhat will happen, is my server will\nforward it out, but if we looked at the,\n\n600\n00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.030\nlet me edit this.\n\n601\n00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.650\nIt's got number of seconds before\nforwarded queries times out.\n\n602\n00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.060\nIt's got three seconds.\n\n603\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.940\nSo it will attempt for three seconds\nto forward the query to Google, and\n\n604\n00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.270\nlet Google do the work.\n\n605\n00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.540\nIf that fails, however, it will fall\nback to the default behavior and\n\n606\n00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.270\nit will go out to the root and\nwork it's way down, all right.\n\n607\n00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.950\nAssuming we still have our root hints in\nthere and we fixed our problem earlier.\n\n608\n00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.650\nIf I don't want that to happen,\nI can uncheck this.\n\n609\n00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.260\nIf I uncheck use routers\nof no phones available\n\n610\n00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.100\nWhat'll happen is it'll forward it.\n\n611\n00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.550\nBut if that forwarding\nfails the query will fail.\n\n612\n00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.810\nIt will not attempt to\nresolve the name on its own.\n\n613\n00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.790\nAnd that might be what you want right?\n\n614\n00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:46.090\nIt depends on the environment that you're\nin, how you have your organization set up.\n\n615\n00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.080\nSo let's test it out here.\n\n616\n00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.100\nI forwarded everything out.\n\n617\n00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.850\nBut I said use root hints if\nno forwarder is available.\n\n618\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:55.940\nI'm going to click okay, and let's ping\nsomething that we haven't pinged before.\n\n619\n00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.150\nCherokee, what's amazon.com?\n\n620\n00:29:59.150 --> 00:29:59.650\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n621\n00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.540\n&gt;&gt; Maybe, all right, so there we go.\n\n622\n00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.000\nSo I've resolved the name.\n\n623\n00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.330\nFrom here I can't really\ntell who I resolved it from.\n\n624\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.920\nI mean there are ways\nwe can go dig in there,\n\n625\n00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.360\nbut an easier way to show you that\nit's working is gonna be to do this.\n\n626\n00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.880\nIf we go back into those forwarders,\nI'm gonna pull up the properties.\n\n627\n00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:26.600\nI'm gonna go to forwarders, and\nI'm gonna edit this and I'm gonna put in.\n\n628\n00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.250\n&gt;&gt; Something random.\n\n629\n00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.180\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, 12.1.2.3 yeah something\nthat I'm for sure not a DNS server.\n\n630\n00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.643\n&gt;&gt; Watch it work [LAUGH], okay yeah.\n\n631\n00:30:31.643 --> 00:30:34.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm pretty sure\nit's not a DNS server.\n\n632\n00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:38.530\nAnd I'll click okay, and\nI'll click okay right?\n\n633\n00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.644\nAnd let's go flush my cache.\n\n634\n00:30:41.644 --> 00:30:45.600\nSo, ipconfig/flushdns.\n\n635\n00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:51.040\nWe'll also flash the cache on the server\nso that that Amazon is not cached,\n\n636\n00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.680\nand then we are gonna try to ping Amazon\nagain, Now, let see what happens.\n\n637\n00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:02.590\nOne, two, three,\ncommon baby you can do it.\n\n638\n00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.050\nIt's thinking about it.\n\n639\n00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.990\nOop, and there you goes it could find,\n\n640\n00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.965\nthat is not exactly what\nI expected it to do.\n\n641\n00:31:10.965 --> 00:31:15.720\nWhat it should have done was,\nwent ahead and used root hints and\n\n642\n00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.390\nresolved the name anyway.\n\n643\n00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.070\nInteresting, so\nlet's take a look at my settings and see.\n\n644\n00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:25.313\nBoy, I'll tell you what,\nthis is a trouble-shooting episode.\n\n645\n00:31:25.313 --> 00:31:28.130\nUse root hints if no\nforwarders are available.\n\n646\n00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:33.870\n&gt;&gt; Do you think all your\nroot hints are healthy now?\n\n647\n00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they should be.\n\n648\n00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.190\nThere it goes.\nIt was just a little slow.\n\n649\n00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:41.620\nSo it is still able to resolve amazon.com.\n\n650\n00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.830\nI just did not wait long enough for\nit to time out.\n\n651\n00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.580\n&gt;&gt; I never wait long enough for things.\n\n652\n00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.090\n&gt;&gt; I know I am impatient.\n\n653\n00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.900\nSo it is still able to resolve names\never though I put in a fake forwarder.\n\n654\n00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.490\nI go back to those properties.\n\n655\n00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.510\nI do not know if I even\nwant to test this now.\n\n656\n00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.380\nClick OK.\n\n657\n00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.390\nDo not use root hents, right?\n\n658\n00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.030\nAnd we'll click OK.\n\n659\n00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.050\n&gt;&gt; So if we clear the cache-\n&gt;&gt; We'll flush the cache.\n\n660\n00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then now we should\nexpect it not to work, right?\n\n661\n00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.236\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and we'll do another flush here.\n\n662\n00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:11.580\nAnd now we'll try to ping amazon.com.\n\n663\n00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.085\nAnd we'll see how patient I can be.\n\n664\n00:32:13.085 --> 00:32:14.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n665\n00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.440\nit could not find hostname amazon.com.\n\n666\n00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.635\nBecause now it doesn't have a choice,\nI tried to forward it.\n\n667\n00:32:19.635 --> 00:32:22.541\nI've taken away it's ability\nto use wood hens and\n\n668\n00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:27.950\nsince the forwarder in this case doesn't\nexist, it can't do anything all right.\n\n669\n00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:32.080\nSo let's fix that back if I go back\ninto the properties of my server and\n\n670\n00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.450\nI edit that forwarder and\n\n671\n00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:39.989\nI change that back to 8.8.8.8.\n\n672\n00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.680\nClick OK, and OK, and we flush our cache.\n\n673\n00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.200\nAnd our clear cache, flush cache.\n\n674\n00:32:51.452 --> 00:32:54.170\nAnd we ping amazon.com again.\n\n675\n00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.540\nThere we go,\nwe are back in business, right.\n\n676\n00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.710\nSo that's how you set up forwarders and\nwhy we would use forwarders.\n\n677\n00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:01.620\nAnd we got some more to do.\n\n678\n00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.760\nWe've go conditional forwarding we\nalso have stubs zones to go over.\n\n679\n00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.560\nBut I'm getting that signal over\nhere telling me that I might have\n\n680\n00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.460\ntalked a little to long.\n\n681\n00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.620\n&gt;&gt; I know people are probably so\nafraid of me now.\n\n682\n00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.940\nLike I'm gonna strangle you or\nsomething if you don't do it on time.\n\n683\n00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.590\nNo, but you are right we are out of time.\n\n684\n00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:20.770\nBut that's okay because we can always\ncome back for another great episode.\n\n685\n00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.700\nSo thank you for that today and\nthank you for joining us as well.\n\n686\n00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.030\nYou don't want to miss\nwhat we have coming next.\n\n687\n00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.570\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n688\n00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:28.360\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n689\n00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.243\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n690\n00:33:30.243 --> 00:33:37.369\n[MUSIC]\n\n691\n00:33:37.369 --> 00:33:40.024\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPROTV.\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:06.570\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.195\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:11.980\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.317\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV, in this show\n\n7\n00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:19.236\nspecifically, we'll continue on our DNS\njourney and we'll take a look at some\n\n8\n00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:23.350\ndifferent types of forwarders, conditional\nforwarding, dynamic forwarding.\n\n9\n00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.109\nI think Mike has quite an assortment\nof forwarding for us here in DNS today.\n\n10\n00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I'd like to welcome you back.\n\n11\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.634\nThank you for joining us today, Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:31.634 --> 00:00:32.679\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for inviting me back.\n\n13\n00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.604\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And not saying that guy talks too much,\n\n14\n00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.590\ndon't put him on any more of your shows.\n\n15\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.420\nYeah, thanks for\nhaving me back and you're right,\n\n16\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.150\nwe do have some more forwarding to do.\n\n17\n00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.880\nA few different types that we wanna take a\nlook at as we are configuring our DNS and\n\n18\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.450\nmaking sure that it's running optimally,\nand optimized for performance.\n\n19\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.640\nCuz that's really what we want to do, we\nwant to make sure that the name resolution\n\n20\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.440\nis functioning, one, because we need to\nresolve those names and IP addresses.\n\n21\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.100\nAnd that it's doing it in, in,\nin a decent amount of time, right?\n\n22\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.920\nEverybody out there has been in a scenario\nwhere you type in a web address or\n\n23\n00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.160\na URL, or a share resource location,\na UNC path.\n\n24\n00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.570\nAnd we get the spinning cheerio or the\nflippy floppy hour glass, and you are like\n\n25\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.161\n&gt;&gt; The flippy floppy hour glass?\n\n26\n00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:17.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the flippy floppy hour glass.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n27\n00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:18.425\n&gt;&gt; There used to be an animated one,\n\n28\n00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:19.444\nI don't know if it's still there.\n\n29\n00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:20.480\n&gt;&gt; I remember.\n\n30\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.790\n&gt;&gt; But that is annoying, right.\n\n31\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.990\nAnd I tell you, it's enough to make me\nclose my browser and do something else.\n\n32\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.945\nI don't like waiting.\n\n33\n00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:29.970\nI'm very impatient for things like that.\n\n34\n00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350\nAll right, so and we don't want our users\ndoing that, we want them succeeding and\n\n35\n00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.460\nmaking money for our company.\n\n36\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.973\n&gt;&gt; Do as I say, not as I do.\n\n37\n00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:38.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] all right.\n\n38\n00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:40.980\nso we talked about forwarding.\n\n39\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.480\nForwarding, we said anything this DNS\nserver does not know on his own, so\n\n40\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.870\nanything that he doesn't have a zone\nfile for and it's not authoritative for.\n\n41\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.170\nJust send it onto somebody else,\nwhoever we've configured, and\n\n42\n00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.120\nlet them do the work.\n\n43\n00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.520\nRemember, it's a recursive query, that\nwe forward on to the other DNS server.\n\n44\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.440\nLet them do the work, and\nthen just give us back the answer.\n\n45\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.130\nWe'll cache the answer and\nwe'll send it on to the client.\n\n46\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.600\nThe client will cache the answer.\n\n47\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.080\nNone of that part changes.\n\n48\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.025\nIt's just who's doing the work for\nresolving the query, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:12.805\nNext thing we're gonna talk about,\n\n50\n00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:16.575\nis something known as conditional\nforwarding, all right?\n\n51\n00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:17.595\nConditional forwarding.\n\n52\n00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.815\nAnd if we think about the name, right,\n\n53\n00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.335\nwe're gonna forward based on a condition,\nall right?\n\n54\n00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:26.560\nAnd the condition is,\nwhat is the DNS suffix for\n\n55\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.700\nthe name that you're trying to resolve?\n\n56\n00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.130\nIn other words,\nif the name ends in xyz.com,\n\n57\n00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.850\nI want you to forward it to\nthis particular DNS server.\n\n58\n00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.790\nNow we can get a little more\nspecific with our forwarding.\n\n59\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.470\nThat's what conditional\nforwarding is all about.\n\n60\n00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.490\nAll right.\n\n61\n00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.380\nAnd it allows me,\nI'm gonna pull up a drawing here, so\n\n62\n00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.870\nlet's take a peek at my screen.\n\n63\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.360\nI think I still have it up.\n\n64\n00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.080\nGot our conditional\nforwarding set up here.\n\n65\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.465\nAnd with the conditional forwarding,\nwhat do I have here,\n\n66\n00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:01.875\nI've got a domain, Contoso.com,\nsitting over here, right?\n\n67\n00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:04.355\nContoso's DNS server,\nwe're the authoritative for that.\n\n68\n00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:06.105\nAnd without conditional forwarding,\n\n69\n00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:08.955\nI could still connect to\nContoso's DNS server, right?\n\n70\n00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:13.200\nBecause my DNS server,\neither using forwarders or\n\n71\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.170\ndoing it itself, would go to route, and\n\n72\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.060\nthen the TLD, find the authoritative\nserver, and get the response.\n\n73\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.280\nAll right?\n\n74\n00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.400\nWhat conditional forwarding allows me\nto do is shortcut this entire process.\n\n75\n00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.860\nWhen my DNS server, when my client sends\na query to the DNS server, and says, hey,\n\n76\n00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.380\nwhat is the IP address of www.contoso.com?\n\n77\n00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.234\nMy DNS server says wait a second,\ncontoso.com.\n\n78\n00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:39.160\nAnd it looks at its\nconditional forwarding rules.\n\n79\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.250\nAnd it says I know the IP address of\nthe authoritative server for contoso.com.\n\n80\n00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.130\nI don't have to ask anybody.\n\n81\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.780\nI can go straight to the horse's mouth,\nif you will, right?\n\n82\n00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.500\nRight to the source and\nget the information.\n\n83\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.570\n&gt;&gt; So we're just kinda speeding\nthat process up a bit?\n\n84\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nwe're shortcutting the whole process.\n\n85\n00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.590\nThere is no more avenue, started the root,\nit's cuz really the goal of going through\n\n86\n00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.030\nthe iterative queries is to find\nthe authoritative DNS server.\n\n87\n00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.990\nThat's the whole point of all that.\n\n88\n00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.550\nAnd so if I can tell my DNS server,\nwho the authoritative server is,\n\n89\n00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.869\nwe can go straight to it.\n\n90\n00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:11.982\n&gt;&gt; Right past those other steps.\n\n91\n00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:13.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n92\n00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.170\nAnd that's gonna speed up the process.\n\n93\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.460\nI'm not gonna do that with everybody,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:21.800\nI could, I could go out, start doing my\nresearch and go, new eggs, DNS server.\n\n95\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.010\nHere's their IP address.\n\n96\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.000\nI'm gonna put a conditional\nforwarding rule in there.\n\n97\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.450\nWe're not doing that for everybody.\n\n98\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.227\nDNS is a pretty quick service as it is.\n\n99\n00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:29.280\n&gt;&gt; It happens, yeah, I was gonna say.\n\n100\n00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.275\nIt happens fast anyway.\n\n101\n00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:34.145\nSo I think it might be beneficial\nin a situation like a merger or\n\n102\n00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:37.875\nacquisition of an organization that hasn't\nthe infrastructure already built up, and\n\n103\n00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:40.285\nyou're doing a lot of\ncommunication between them but-\n\n104\n00:04:40.285 --> 00:04:41.025\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\n\n105\n00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:44.185\nyou know when you've got a business\npartner that you're constantly connecting\n\n106\n00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:47.475\nto their web app or\ndoing some work with them or\n\n107\n00:04:47.475 --> 00:04:49.905\nsomething like that,\nthis can speed up that process.\n\n108\n00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:51.901\nHey, you want use a lot of emails,\ngo back and forth.\n\n109\n00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:56.390\nRight, I've gotta look up the IP address\nfor the destination email server.\n\n110\n00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.390\nWell, I can get straight to\ntheir DNS server and say hey,\n\n111\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.570\ngive me the annex record for contoso.com.\n\n112\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.740\nBut I don't have to go through\nall of that other process.\n\n113\n00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.290\nSo it can definitely speed\nup what is already quick.\n\n114\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.530\nBut when we looked at it,\nit make it even quicker, right?\n\n115\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.800\nOr could be a scenario where\nmaybe I can't resolve this,\n\n116\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.310\nthrough the normal means for some reason.\n\n117\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.210\nOne reason or another, I'll give you\na couple of examples, maybe, in a minute.\n\n118\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.200\nAnd so the only way to get it done,\n\n119\n00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.130\nwould be to do a conditional\nforwarding rule like this.\n\n120\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.330\nYou might have a dev domain, right.\n\n121\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.590\nOr a separate forest that you do for,\nyou've got your production and\n\n122\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.910\nyou've got your development forest.\n\n123\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.710\nAnd they're not registered\nexternally with their names.\n\n124\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.960\nBut I still need to be able to\nresolve those names from over here\n\n125\n00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.590\nin my production domain.\n\n126\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.770\nSo I could do conditional forwarding\nover to the DNS server for\n\n127\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.850\nthat private, not exposed to the outside,\nnetwork, all right?\n\n128\n00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.830\nThat might be one reason.\n\n129\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.296\nBut, as Cherokee said, a more common\nreason is really, business partners,\n\n130\n00:05:58.296 --> 00:06:02.967\nmerging networks, and I just want to speed\nup the name resolution, cuz I know I'm\n\n131\n00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:07.256\ngonna have a abundance of requests that\nend in that particular DNS suffix.\n\n132\n00:06:07.256 --> 00:06:09.440\nAll right, so that's what\nconditional forwarding is all about.\n\n133\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.940\nAnd understand,\nthat we can still resolve names normally.\n\n134\n00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.850\nWhen I set up conditional forwarding,\nit's an if, it's a condition, right.\n\n135\n00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.574\nSo if the name ends in contoso.com, go\nstraight to the contoso.com's DNS server,\n\n136\n00:06:22.574 --> 00:06:26.195\nbut if it doesn't end contoso.com,\njust do your normal thing.\n\n137\n00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:27.185\n&gt;&gt; Just go right through your process.\n\n138\n00:06:27.185 --> 00:06:27.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n139\n00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:31.385\nWhether that's go to the root yourself and\nuse your iterative queries, or\n\n140\n00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:35.495\nwhether that's forwarded on to ISP's DNS\nserver and let them do the work.\n\n141\n00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:36.785\nThat part doesn't change.\n\n142\n00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:37.345\nRight?\nFor\n\n143\n00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:41.230\nanything my server doesn't know,\nit still does that normal process.\n\n144\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.300\nBut if it ends in contoso.com,\nit does something special.\n\n145\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.100\nAnd I can set up as many conditional\nforwarding rules as I need, right?\n\n146\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.200\nSo I can have multiple rules in there.\n\n147\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.650\nA heavily domained forest is\nalso another place you'll see\n\n148\n00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.110\nconditional forwarding done.\n\n149\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.801\nBecause when we look at the way DNS works,\nif I'm in a,\n\n150\n00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:05.558\nand I don't have a, maybe I do have\na drawing for something like this.\n\n151\n00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:08.885\nI've got my stub zones drawing and\nthat would actually,\n\n152\n00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:11.540\nI'm not gonna save any changes I made.\n\n153\n00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.120\nAnd here's a good example,\nnow this is stub zones but\n\n154\n00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.900\nit does show me the same kind of idea.\n\n155\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.260\nBecause we're going to see stub zones and\nconditional forwarding are very,\n\n156\n00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.380\nvery similar, they actually accomplish\nthe same results in different ways.\n\n157\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.510\nBut here, if I'm over here in\nsupport.west.microsoft.com, right?\n\n158\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.100\nA child domain in this tree, and I need\nto connect to a printer or some other\n\n159\n00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.020\nresource in training.east.microsoft.com,\nI still have to go through the normal\n\n160\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.770\nprocess of finding the authoritative\nserver for training.east.microsoft,com.\n\n161\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.013\nAnd my DNS servers are gonna\nhave delegations, and\n\n162\n00:07:43.013 --> 00:07:46.530\nthey're gonna know who it is, but\nI'm going to have to start here.\n\n163\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.957\nHe's gonna say, I'm not authoritative for\neast.microsoft.com, and\n\n164\n00:07:50.957 --> 00:07:53.149\nhe'll give me the IP address for east.\n\n165\n00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:55.764\nAnd east is gonna say, well,\nI'm not authoritative for\n\n166\n00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:57.517\ntraining.east.microsoft.com.\n\n167\n00:07:57.517 --> 00:08:00.012\nAnd he'll return the IP address for\ntraining, and\n\n168\n00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:02.051\nI'll finally get down here to training.\n\n169\n00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:05.324\nIf I add a conditional forwarding\nrule that said if the name ends in\n\n170\n00:08:05.324 --> 00:08:08.899\ntraining.Microsofteast.Microsoft.com\nhere's the IP address of\n\n171\n00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:10.520\nthe authoritative DNS server.\n\n172\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.970\nYou could go straight to it, right?\n\n173\n00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.350\nAnd it wouldn't have to\ngo through the process.\n\n174\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.180\nSo again we're shortcutting that process.\n\n175\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.300\nAnd if you have a scenario were you've\ngot multiple domains within your forest\n\n176\n00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.340\nthis could definitely speed up\nthe name resolution process.\n\n177\n00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.340\nWhat if this DNS server, for\nsome reason not available?\n\n178\n00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.450\nNow all of a sudden I'm gonna have trouble\ngetting referrals down to the next\n\n179\n00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.470\nDNS server.\n\n180\n00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.200\nAnd that could definitely slow things down\nas well, if not impede them altogether.\n\n181\n00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.890\nWith conditional forwarding I'm\nnot dependent on anything else.\n\n182\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.550\nI'm going straight to\nthe authoritative DNS server for\n\n183\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.590\nthe name I'm trying to resolve.\n\n184\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.260\nI'll leave this drawing up so\nwe don't lose it,\n\n185\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.020\nbecause we are gonna talk about\nstub zones in just a little bit.\n\n186\n00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.900\nBut let's see how we can set\nup conditional forwarding.\n\n187\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.350\nNow remember, I don't think I undid that\nso I'm still forwarding all external\n\n188\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.520\nrequests out to-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n189\n00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.720\nthis is what we set up in that last show.\n\n190\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.020\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; Or the previous show.\n\n191\n00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.870\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\nwe're still forwarding everything out.\n\n192\n00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.840\nI did uncheck use root tense, right?\n\n193\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.690\nSo if my forward is not there, I'm not\ngonna be able to resolve external names.\n\n194\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.100\nThat's okay, we'll leave that.\n\n195\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.810\nConditional forwarding used to be,\nif you've been doing for a little while.\n\n196\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.480\nConditional forwarding used to be on\nthe properties of your DNS server.\n\n197\n00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.240\nIt was an actual tab on\nthe Properties interface.\n\n198\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.560\nAnd we would set it up there, but once,\nwhen it was new, it was added there.\n\n199\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.600\nNow it's actually its own node\nout here in my DNS console.\n\n200\n00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.880\nSo it just makes it a little\nbit easier to get to.\n\n201\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.424\nAnd I have another domain controller,\nfrom a separate forest over here,\n\n202\n00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:41.290\ncontoso.local.\n\n203\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.570\nContoso being one of Microsoft's\ndemonstration domain names.\n\n204\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.080\nI didn't want to conflict with anything,\nso I did dot local to make sure I,\n\n205\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.670\nyou know, because I did give\nthese guys internet access\n\n206\n00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.820\nto set up some of our\nexternal name resolution.\n\n207\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.450\nSo I've got this contoso.local,\nit's a separate forest,\n\n208\n00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.050\nseparate domain in a separate forest.\n\n209\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.660\nAnd what I'm going to do, they happen\nto be on the same physical network so\n\n210\n00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.610\nI've got electrical connectivity\nbetween these two machines.\n\n211\n00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.391\nAnd from DC1 I'm going to try to ping\n\n212\n00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:18.581\nsvr02.contoso.loca.\n\n213\n00:10:18.581 --> 00:10:22.550\nIt says request could not find\nthe host svr02 blah, blah, blah.\n\n214\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.690\nAnd think about what my DNs server did.\n\n215\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.520\nIt sent the query to the local DNS server,\nright?\n\n216\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.930\nHe looked, he's not authoritative.\n\n217\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.790\nSo he said what am I\nsupposed to do with this?\n\n218\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.930\nHe's got a conditional\nforwarding rule set up.\n\n219\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.744\nSo he's sending out to 8.8.8.8.\n\n220\n00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:40.530\n8.8.8.8 tried to find it.\n\n221\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.590\nAnd we know this name isn't\nactually gonna resolve to anything\n\n222\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.390\nout in the public, right?\n\n223\n00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.140\nSo he says hey, I went to the root and\nthere's no .local top level domain server.\n\n224\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.190\nSo name does not exist,\ncouldn't find host, yada yada.\n\n225\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.940\nSo it couldn't resolve it.\n\n226\n00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.322\nSo let's see if we can fix that\nwith our conditional forwarding.\n\n227\n00:11:00.322 --> 00:11:04.340\nSo we're going to right click on\nconditional forwarding in my DNS console,\n\n228\n00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.830\nand choose New Conditional Forwarder.\n\n229\n00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:13.540\nAnd the domain name that I want to\ncreate this rule for is contoso.local.\n\n230\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.580\nI'm sure it goes without saying, but\n\n231\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.890\nyou make sure you don't have any typos\nin there or it's not going to work.\n\n232\n00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:22.900\nAnd then click here to add, you're telling\nit, who is their authoritative DNS server?\n\n233\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.134\nIn my case, 10.10.8 202.\n\n234\n00:11:27.134 --> 00:11:31.960\nAnd it will eventually resolve that and\nI should get a green x at some point.\n\n235\n00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.340\nMake sure I did spell that right,\ncontoso.local.\n\n236\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.470\nAll right.\n\n237\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.130\nAnd then I have the option down here and I\nknow it says it's not working but it will.\n\n238\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.610\nWe'll keep our fingers crossed anyway.\n\n239\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.210\nIf not hey, we'll fix it.\n\n240\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.730\nAnd store the conditional\nforwarder in active directory.\n\n241\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.240\nThis is a cool option that\nthey've added recently.\n\n242\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.150\nI wanna say it was 2008,\nbecause conditional forwarders,\n\n243\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.320\nit's not an active directory object.\n\n244\n00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.360\nIf I have five DNS servers, I'd have to\ncreate this rule on all five servers.\n\n245\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.060\nWell now I can store it in active\ndirectory, as an active directory object,\n\n246\n00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.740\nand I can replicate it to all\nDNS servers in the forest, or\n\n247\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.180\nall DNS servers in the domain.\n\n248\n00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.910\nWell I only have one domain in my forest\nso it really doesn't make a difference\n\n249\n00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.950\nwhat I choose, but\nI'll leave it on that default there.\n\n250\n00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.610\n&gt;&gt; You know Mike that little red X there,\nI've gotten that too.\n\n251\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.410\nIs that always gonna happen whenever we're\nsetting this up and when you go ahead and\n\n252\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.550\ngrant the permission it\nkinda goes away eventually?\n\n253\n00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.780\n&gt;&gt; In this case it resolved the name.\n\n254\n00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.300\nSometimes that X will be there because it\ncan't resolve the name into an IP address.\n\n255\n00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.675\nThis time I can look at\nthe validation column,\n\n256\n00:12:37.675 --> 00:12:42.690\nsays the server with this IP address is\nnot authoritative for the required zone.\n\n257\n00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.190\nWell, I can tell you that it is,\nif I go to server 02, and\n\n258\n00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.550\nI open up my DNS console.\n\n259\n00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.600\nI happen to be the one that made it.\n\n260\n00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.700\nSo I'm pretty sure it is.\n\n261\n00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.750\nThere is contoso.local and\nI did spell it right.\n\n262\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.090\nContoso.local.\n\n263\n00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:00.330\nSo at this point it's just a matter of\nthat wizard not being able to determine\n\n264\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.370\nthat the server is actually-\n&gt;&gt; Okay gotcha cause' I know every\n\n265\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.839\ntime I do it I'll see that too and yeah,\nit works, but I'm seeing the little error.\n\n266\n00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:09.650\n&gt;&gt; And most likely once we get\nthis set up and he talks to him,\n\n267\n00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.760\nit might fix this problem.\n\n268\n00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.850\nBecause it doesn't have an FQDN,\n\n269\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.630\nit just says srv02,\nit doesn't have .contoso.local.\n\n270\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.230\nSo, it's having a couple of issues\nthere but it will pick it up.\n\n271\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.510\nBecause it will use the IP address\nthen it will talk to it and\n\n272\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.518\neverything should be fine.\n\n273\n00:13:23.518 --> 00:13:24.441\nAll right.\n\n274\n00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:26.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We will go ahead and\n\n275\n00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.980\nclick OK on my conditional\nforwarding rule.\n\n276\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.150\nAnd now when I look in\nConditional Forwarding,\n\n277\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.220\nI have a node for contoso.local.\n\n278\n00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.560\nAnd I can see my conditional\nforwarding rule there 10.10.8 202.\n\n279\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.230\nSo if I open up my command prompt again,\n\n280\n00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.415\nI'm going to flush my cache just in case.\n\n281\n00:13:45.415 --> 00:13:52.212\n[SOUND] All right, and now we're gonna\ntry to ping srv02.contoso.local and\n\n282\n00:13:52.212 --> 00:13:56.992\nbadda bing, badda boom,\nwe're able to ping srv02.\n\n283\n00:13:56.992 --> 00:14:01.698\nNotice it resolved it into a fully\nqualified domain name, got the IP address,\n\n284\n00:14:01.698 --> 00:14:05.060\nand then was able to ping that IP address.\n\n285\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.400\nSo we see that conditional\nforwarding is working.\n\n286\n00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.500\nIt now knows if the name ends in contoso,\nto go talk to it.\n\n287\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.650\nOr go straight to that\nauthoritative DNS server.\n\n288\n00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:19.640\nNow let's see, Cherokee, if it fixed-\nI don't know if I can actually see it.\n\n289\n00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.340\nI'm going to have to edit it,\nand I can do that here.\n\n290\n00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.610\nYeah, I don't see a red X there, but\nit's not quite the same screen anymore.\n\n291\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.299\nThere we go.\n\n292\n00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:29.880\n&gt;&gt; Green.\n&gt;&gt; So I've got a green check mark.\n\n293\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.600\nWe are good to go.\n\n294\n00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.647\nAll right.\nSo that is conditional forwarding.\n\n295\n00:14:34.647 --> 00:14:37.310\nAgain, you can set up as\nmany of those as you need.\n\n296\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.590\nIf you had multiple dev domains or\n\n297\n00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.894\nwhatever you were using\nconditional forwarders for.\n\n298\n00:14:44.894 --> 00:14:46.750\n&gt;&gt; You did mention stub zones.\n\n299\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.620\n&gt;&gt; I did, but before we get there,\n\n300\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.377\nI do wanna talk about the downsides\nof conditionalforwarding.\n\n301\n00:14:52.377 --> 00:14:55.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, because there are a couple.\n\n302\n00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.620\nOne in particular, and in that is,\n\n303\n00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.950\nthat it's very manual,\nI typed in this IP address.\n\n304\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.534\nI had to one, determine what the IP\naddress was of my business partner's DNS\n\n305\n00:15:04.534 --> 00:15:07.625\nserver or whomever I'm doing\nthis conditional forwarding for.\n\n306\n00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:09.028\nIf it's internal, what have you.\n\n307\n00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:12.836\nI have to determine what is the IP\naddress of their DNS server so\n\n308\n00:15:12.836 --> 00:15:15.200\nthat I could put it in here.\n\n309\n00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.350\nAnd if their IP address ever\nchanges I've gotta come in here and\n\n310\n00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.370\nmanually update this.\n\n311\n00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:25.440\nI've gotta come in here, right-click on\nthe contoso.local, choose Properties,\n\n312\n00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.870\nEdit, and then manually modify that IP\naddress, if I wanna make the change.\n\n313\n00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.209\nNow when am I gonna know that\ntheir IP address changed?\n\n314\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.820\nMost likely, when one of my clients,\none of my users says hey,\n\n315\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.080\nI can't connect to contoso.local anymore.\n\n316\n00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.930\nWhat the heck is going on?\n\n317\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:41.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n318\n00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.130\nI'll get a support ticket saying that\nI'm having problems resolving names.\n\n319\n00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.435\nI'll come in here.\n\n320\n00:15:46.435 --> 00:15:48.275\nI'll have to call my buddy\nover there at Contoso.\n\n321\n00:15:48.275 --> 00:15:50.459\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unless you're really\nchummy with them beforehand and\n\n322\n00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:53.239\nthey give you the heads up, but\notherwise that's probably what'll happen.\n\n323\n00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:55.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou're going to find out when it breaks.\n\n324\n00:15:55.492 --> 00:15:57.313\nAnd that's a little bit of a downside.\n\n325\n00:15:57.313 --> 00:15:59.352\nUnless you're doing this internally.\n\n326\n00:15:59.352 --> 00:16:01.904\nAnd you might be aware of that change\nthat's getting ready to be made.\n\n327\n00:16:01.904 --> 00:16:04.840\nAnd you can update your records,\nbut again, it's very manual.\n\n328\n00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.940\nI am gonna have to modify it manually.\n\n329\n00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.387\nIt's not gonna update automatically.\n\n330\n00:16:08.387 --> 00:16:11.496\nIf that IP address changes on\ncontoso.local's DNS server,\n\n331\n00:16:11.496 --> 00:16:14.378\nit's not gonna update my\nconditional forwarding rule.\n\n332\n00:16:14.378 --> 00:16:17.581\n.So that is an issue with\nconditional forwarding,\n\n333\n00:16:17.581 --> 00:16:21.170\nsomething to think about anyway,\nall right?\n\n334\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:25.580\nNow when we talk about resolving names for\n\n335\n00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.650\nother domains like this,\nan external entities.\n\n336\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.040\nThere's a couple of ways we can do it.\n\n337\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.810\nAnd I probably should have\nmentioned those first, so\n\n338\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.280\nlet's talk about those real quick.\n\n339\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.740\nNow, I could set up,\nI'm trying to think of a way to say this.\n\n340\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.720\nWe could do secondary zones, right?\n\n341\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:48.270\nA secondary zone is a read-only\ncopy of a zone file, okay?\n\n342\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:53.208\nSo one way I could resolve contoso.local's\nnames is just get a copy of their\n\n343\n00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:54.529\nzone file, right?\n\n344\n00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:59.255\nI could make a new zone for, like right\nhere, I'm gonna right click, New Zone,\n\n345\n00:16:59.255 --> 00:17:00.380\nI'll click Next.\n\n346\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.270\nAnd I'm gonna create a secondary zone.\n\n347\n00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.140\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n348\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.925\nAnd I'm gonna do a forward lookup and\nNext.\n\n349\n00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:14.020\nThe zone name, contoso.local, Next.\n\n350\n00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.503\nAnd their master, the one I wanna\npull the information, is 202, right?\n\n351\n00:17:18.503 --> 00:17:21.250\nI get green check marks across the board,\neverything looks good.\n\n352\n00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.130\nI'll click Next and finish, and it says.\n\n353\n00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.640\n[LAUGH] That's not what\nI wanted it to say,\n\n354\n00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.680\nconditional forwarding already exists for\nthat name.\n\n355\n00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.430\nAll right, I'll click OK,\nlet me cancel and\n\n356\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.340\nlet's get rid of my conditional\nforwarding real quick.\n\n357\n00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.610\nWe can always recreate that pretty easily.\n\n358\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.986\nSo I guess I wanna delete that.\n\n359\n00:17:37.986 --> 00:17:41.210\n&gt;&gt; Which brings up a good point\nbecause you really wouldn't need\n\n360\n00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.632\none if you had the other [LAUGH].\n\n361\n00:17:42.632 --> 00:17:46.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're exactly right, the whole\npoint is how can I resolve names for\n\n362\n00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.760\nthis other domain contoso local.\n\n363\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.870\nSo if I do New Zone again,\nI'll go with this real quick.\n\n364\n00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.875\nSecondary, zone name contoso.local.\n\n365\n00:17:54.875 --> 00:18:01.100\nAnybody knows what's going to happen here,\nyou should type it in the chat room.\n\n366\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.944\nTinTin8202, I'll click Next and Finish.\n\n367\n00:18:04.944 --> 00:18:06.956\nAnd now I have got a zone for\ncontoso.local.\n\n368\n00:18:06.956 --> 00:18:10.490\nAnd I think, okay great,\nnow my server is authoritative or\n\n369\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.820\nhas the information for\nall the IP addresses for contoso.local.\n\n370\n00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.460\nI can resolve those names.\n\n371\n00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.970\nNotice I get a red X here, right?\n\n372\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.690\nIt says it cannot load that zone file.\n\n373\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.160\nBut we saw the other day when\nI first created a zone, and\n\n374\n00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.450\nwe just said right click + transfer from\nmaster &gt; refresh, and everything's good.\n\n375\n00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.503\n&gt;&gt; Security, though?\n\n376\n00:18:30.503 --> 00:18:31.787\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We can't just get\n\n377\n00:18:31.787 --> 00:18:33.611\nwilly-nilly trusting everyone now, Mike?\n\n378\n00:18:33.611 --> 00:18:36.440\n&gt;&gt; We can't do that, can we, right?\n\n379\n00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.320\nSo here, the problem with\nsecondary zones is you are talking\n\n380\n00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.195\nto their DNS server and saying,\ngive me copy of your zone file, right?\n\n381\n00:18:45.195 --> 00:18:49.738\nThere's a special query that gets sent\nwhen DNS servers talk to each other.\n\n382\n00:18:49.738 --> 00:18:56.210\nIt's got what they call opcodes that\nthey do the zone transfers with.\n\n383\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.394\nAnd exactly what Cherokee said,\n\n384\n00:18:58.394 --> 00:19:02.533\nI don't have permissions to\nrequest a copy of their zone file.\n\n385\n00:19:02.533 --> 00:19:07.558\nNow, if this is internal, if this is my\nDEV that I'm trying to setup this zone,\n\n386\n00:19:07.558 --> 00:19:11.833\nsecondary zone for, I might be able\nto talk to their domain admins or\n\n387\n00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:14.708\nit might be even me if\nI'm enterprise admin.\n\n388\n00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:18.116\nI could give myself or\nI can talk to them, put in a request, and\n\n389\n00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:21.410\nthey can give me permission to\nget a copy of their zone file.\n\n390\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.810\nAnd once they add me to their\ntrusted DNS servers, right?\n\n391\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.450\nWe saw that the other day where I\nwent to the zone transfers tab and\n\n392\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.645\nsaid this server is allowed to request\na copy of the zone file, all right?\n\n393\n00:19:32.645 --> 00:19:37.629\nBut it it's not internal,\nall right, if I call up Microsoft,\n\n394\n00:19:37.629 --> 00:19:42.060\nand I say hey Microsoft,\nI need a copy of your zone file.\n\n395\n00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.580\nWhat do you think they're gonna tell me?\n\n396\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.080\nYou think Microsoft's gonna give\nme a copy of their zone file?\n\n397\n00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.772\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n398\n00:19:47.772 --> 00:19:48.870\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.670\n&gt;&gt; Cuz think about, right?\n\n400\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.340\nWe talked about this.\n\n401\n00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.920\nWhat is in the zone file?\n\n402\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.816\nIt's a map to every machine.\n\n403\n00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:57.730\nTheir name, their IP address, it's\nwhich machines are domain controllers.\n\n404\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.930\nWhich ones are mail servers?\n\n405\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.880\nWhich ones are DNS servers?\n\n406\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.200\nAll that information, they are not\ngonna give that to just anybody, right?\n\n407\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.290\nAnd they gotta have some\nreally good trust involved\n\n408\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.550\nin order to allow somebody to\nget that copy of that zone file.\n\n409\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.330\nSo unless it's internal, even if it's\na really good business partner, right?\n\n410\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.500\nIf I was partnered with\nthis other organization,\n\n411\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.280\nwe did a lot of work together,\nthey don't need my entire zone file.\n\n412\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.549\nThey need to be able to connect to my web\napp, out my front end, my mail server,\n\n413\n00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:27.738\nand stuff like that.\n\n414\n00:20:27.738 --> 00:20:32.483\nBut they don't need the IP address of\nevery private computer on my network,\n\n415\n00:20:32.483 --> 00:20:37.200\nall my just Windows 8 boxes,\nmy daily users, they don't need those.\n\n416\n00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.455\nWhat are they gonna do with that?\nThey're not connecting to Bob's laptop or\n\n417\n00:20:40.455 --> 00:20:45.070\nSusie's desktop over here in her office,\nor they better not be.\n\n418\n00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.292\nBut if I give them that zone file,\n\n419\n00:20:46.292 --> 00:20:49.020\nthey've [LAUGH] got the information\nto try to do it anyway, right?\n\n420\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.680\nSo secondary zones, typically not\nan option unless you're going,\n\n421\n00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.420\nif it's internal, or you own both\norganizations, or something like that.\n\n422\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.310\nSo secondary zones, not gonna work.\n\n423\n00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.010\nSo that's where conditional\nforwarding comes in.\n\n424\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.810\nRather than me give you, or rather than\nyou give me a copy of your entire zone\n\n425\n00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:14.910\nfile, how about you just tell me either\nIP address of one of your DNS servers,\n\n426\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:16.720\nand I'll just forward my queries over.\n\n427\n00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.380\nYou still maintain your zone file.\n\n428\n00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.600\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a better plan.\n\n429\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\nA whole lot more secure,\n\n430\n00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:27.490\nkeeping that information close to\nyour vest is gonna be a good thing.\n\n431\n00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.120\nAll right, I'm gonna delete this secondary\nzone because it's not gonna load unless I\n\n432\n00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.610\ngo give myself permission.\n\n433\n00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.920\nAnd I'm not gonna do that.\n\n434\n00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.110\nBecause in this scenario I'm not\ncontoso.local, that's somebody else.\n\n435\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.297\nAnd I don't have the right to go\nover there and manage their DNS.\n\n436\n00:21:40.297 --> 00:21:43.160\nSo they're not gonna let me\ncreate the secondary zone.\n\n437\n00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.788\nSo we use conditional forwarding,\n[COUGH] which works fine, except for\n\n438\n00:21:46.788 --> 00:21:48.250\nthe fact that it's manual.\n\n439\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.010\nLike I said, it's a manual process.\n\n440\n00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.050\nAnd when things change I have\nto manually reconfigure that.\n\n441\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.050\nSo if there was just a solution\nthat we could, you know what,\n\n442\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.738\nI never did go through my testing for\nthe conditional forwarding, did I?\n\n443\n00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:06.030\n[CROSSTALK] I guess we did see it, right?\n\n444\n00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.780\nLet's try it again, let's see.\n\n445\n00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.210\nDo we have conditional forwarding set up?\n\n446\n00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.000\n&gt;&gt; I think you just deleted it.\n\n447\n00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.500\n&gt;&gt; We deleted it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n448\n00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n449\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.159\n&gt;&gt; At this point if I ping SVR01.\n\n450\n00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:23.337\nI'm sorry 02.contoso.local\n\n451\n00:22:23.337 --> 00:22:26.750\nI better type faster, it's still working\nso let me flush out some caches.\n\n452\n00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.420\nIpconfig flush DNS.\n\n453\n00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.530\nAnd we'll clear my DNS cache and\nwe're gonna try that\n\n454\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:41.460\none more time and it can't find the name,\nwhich is what we expect.\n\n455\n00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.760\nSo we're gonna set up conditional\nforwarding new conditional forwarder.\n\n456\n00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.824\nFor Contoso,\nif I could spell that, .local.\n\n457\n00:22:49.824 --> 00:22:56.091\nAnd I'll add the IP address of their\nDNS server, 10.10.8.202, all right?\n\n458\n00:22:56.091 --> 00:22:58.610\nAnd I'll go ahead and put it in\nActive Directory and we'll click OK.\n\n459\n00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.389\nAnd I don't need permission for\nthis, right?\n\n460\n00:23:00.389 --> 00:23:05.340\nI mean, I could set up conditional\nforwarders to Microsoft if I wanted to.\n\n461\n00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.920\nI could go get Microsoft's DNS address,\nand I could set up a conditional forward,\n\n462\n00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.670\ncuz I'm not doing anything.\n\n463\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.860\n&gt;&gt; Cuz nothing on their end is changing.\n\n464\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.290\nThey're still accepting and handling\nthose requests as they normally would.\n\n465\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we're just now going\nstraight to them instead of going root,\n\n466\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.410\ncom, and then microsoft.com, right?\n\n467\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.410\nSo we're just shortcutting the process,\nto them it's no different, exactly right.\n\n468\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.370\nSo if I now try to ping,\nwe're gonna have to flush my cache.\n\n469\n00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.760\nThis is really what I wanted to show you,\nso\n\n470\n00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.605\nI'm gonna a shortcut some\nof these demo steps here.\n\n471\n00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:33.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, Mike.\n\n472\n00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.120\n&gt;&gt; Cuz this is what I wanted to show you.\n\n473\n00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.840\nWe've talked about flushing caches, and\n\n474\n00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.180\nwe talked about good reasons\nto flush the caches out,\n\n475\n00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.360\nboth at the client level, the DNS Client\nResolver, as well as the server level.\n\n476\n00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.870\nAnd this is a great example of that, but\n\n477\n00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.280\nit also points out\nanother interesting fact.\n\n478\n00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.603\nEarlier I pinged it and it said,\ncould not find the host,\n\n479\n00:23:53.603 --> 00:23:57.565\nwell now I've set up conditional\nforwarding and I pinged it again.\n\n480\n00:23:57.565 --> 00:24:01.718\nAnd it still says it can't find the host,\nwhy is that, right?\n\n481\n00:24:01.718 --> 00:24:05.190\nIf I had a bad IP address, maybe that\nI could understand, flush the cache,\n\n482\n00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.600\nwe should be fine.\n\n483\n00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.220\nHere, I didn't get an IP address back,\ncould not find the host.\n\n484\n00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.734\nYet I still, now that I've set it up,\ncan't find the host, why?\n\n485\n00:24:13.734 --> 00:24:20.176\nLet's take a look, IP config, not flush,\nI almost killed our example there.\n\n486\n00:24:20.176 --> 00:24:23.231\n[LAUGH] displaydns, and\n\n487\n00:24:23.231 --> 00:24:27.819\nlet's see what we can find in here.\n\n488\n00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:30.720\nWhat does this say,\nCherokee, can you read that?\n\n489\n00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.757\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't exist.\n\n490\n00:24:31.757 --> 00:24:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and this is my cache, right?\n\n491\n00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.190\nSo when I couldn't resolve\nthe name into an IP address,\n\n492\n00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.920\nnot only do I get the message in my\ncommand prompt saying hey, can't connect,\n\n493\n00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.290\ncan't find it,\nit cached the fact that it can't find it.\n\n494\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:48.490\nSo even though I fixed the problem,\nwhen I go to ping it again,\n\n495\n00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:49.620\nit looks at its cache first.\n\n496\n00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.340\nRemember, they always look at\nthe cache first, because it's local,\n\n497\n00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.890\nit's the fastest possible option.\n\n498\n00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.680\nSo there's a cached entry that says,\n\n499\n00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.970\nthis name doesn't exist, so he's not\neven gonna try to look it up again.\n\n500\n00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.450\nEven though I fixed the problem,\nhe's not trying,\n\n501\n00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.370\nbecause there's this record in there.\n\n502\n00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:11.490\nSo now if we ipconfig flushdns,\nand then we try\n\n503\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:17.690\nto do our ping again, everything\nstarts working just fine, right?\n\n504\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.810\nSo it's something to think about,\nto keep in the back of your mind.\n\n505\n00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.954\nYou've fixed a problem, or you think\nyou've fixed a problem, and you're trying\n\n506\n00:25:24.954 --> 00:25:28.936\nto Test your solution and you're going\ncrazy going, why isn't this working?\n\n507\n00:25:28.936 --> 00:25:31.482\nDon't forget it caches name\ndon't exist records, and\n\n508\n00:25:31.482 --> 00:25:34.560\nhere's another thing that\nyou wanna pay attention to.\n\n509\n00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:39.855\nHow can I show you this,\nI've already fixed that,\n\n510\n00:25:39.855 --> 00:25:44.535\nlet's see if I do this,\nping google.com and\n\n511\n00:25:44.535 --> 00:25:48.120\nlet's display that cache again.\n\n512\n00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.381\nBut I don't have, well,\nhere's another example,\n\n513\n00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:52.050\nI don't know what this Win 8 IPv6 is.\n\n514\n00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:56.220\nThis is one of my client machines, but\nit's another name doesn't exist entry.\n\n515\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.420\nRemember, we talked about TTL, and we\nsaid these cached entries only stay until\n\n516\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.032\nthe TTL expires,\nthen it flushes it out, right?\n\n517\n00:26:03.032 --> 00:26:08.234\nWell, look at the TTL on this name\ndoesn't exist, do you see one?\n\n518\n00:26:08.234 --> 00:26:08.896\n&gt;&gt; I don't see one.\n\n519\n00:26:08.896 --> 00:26:13.780\n&gt;&gt; That's because there isn't one, so this\nwill not time out, it stays there forever.\n\n520\n00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.304\n&gt;&gt; And that stinks.\n\n521\n00:26:14.304 --> 00:26:16.905\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly right,\nso you're troubleshooting,\n\n522\n00:26:16.905 --> 00:26:19.214\nyou're trying to figure out\nwhy this isn't working.\n\n523\n00:26:19.214 --> 00:26:23.565\nAnd it's never gonna get rid of\nthis name doesn't exist record, and\n\n524\n00:26:23.565 --> 00:26:25.300\nyou have to do it manually.\n\n525\n00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:30.020\nThat's what I wanted to point out, was\nthat there's no TTL on name doesn't exist.\n\n526\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.190\nSo the only way to get rid of it\nis to flush your cache, all right?\n\n527\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.100\nWhich is why a lot of times, reboots\nfix things, right, everybody's like,\n\n528\n00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.600\nwhen in doubt, reboot.\n\n529\n00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.700\nThe reason that works all the time\nis cuz you're flushing caches, and\n\n530\n00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.810\nnot just this cache, but other caches\nas well, this being one of them.\n\n531\n00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.898\nRight, cache is temporary, so\nthat's the magic behind in the reboot.\n\n532\n00:26:50.898 --> 00:26:55.819\nAll right, let's see, we've done\nconditional forwarding, now, Cherokee,\n\n533\n00:26:55.819 --> 00:26:59.056\nwe'll get over there to our stub zones,\nsound good?\n\n534\n00:26:59.056 --> 00:26:59.782\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can't leave them out.\n\n535\n00:26:59.782 --> 00:27:06.055\n&gt;&gt; I can't leave those out, so\nstub zones came around in 2003.\n\n536\n00:27:06.055 --> 00:27:08.243\n&gt;&gt; We're getting a history lesson too,\nokay.\n\n537\n00:27:08.243 --> 00:27:09.482\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n538\n00:27:09.482 --> 00:27:10.451\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you went back to 1970s and\nARPANET.\n\n539\n00:27:10.451 --> 00:27:15.235\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] True.\n&gt;&gt; I can go back a few years, right?\n\n540\n00:27:15.235 --> 00:27:16.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do that.\n\n541\n00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.409\n&gt;&gt; And don't quote me on it,\nthough, I could be wrong.\n\n542\n00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:20.976\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I wanna say it was 2003 when stub\n\n543\n00:27:20.976 --> 00:27:22.049\nzones came out.\n\n544\n00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:26.786\nBut stub zones are another way we can do\n\n545\n00:27:26.786 --> 00:27:31.830\nconditional forwarding, if you will.\n\n546\n00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.090\nWe know conditional forwarding is,\nif the name ends in this,\n\n547\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.900\nhere's the IP address of the authoritative\nDNS server, go straight to it.\n\n548\n00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.480\nBut the problem with conditional\nforwarders was that it was static, and\n\n549\n00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.930\nif anything changes,\nI have to update it manually.\n\n550\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:52.510\nStub zones, however,\nare dynamic conditional forwarding,\n\n551\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.820\nis really what you wanna\nthink about with stub zones.\n\n552\n00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.309\n&gt;&gt; Why didn't they just call it that?\n\n553\n00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:01.950\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, [LAUGH] I don't know,\nI'm not even gonna guess.\n\n554\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.730\n[LAUGH] But that's really how I\nwant you to think about stub zones,\n\n555\n00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.530\nis dynamic conditional forwarding.\n\n556\n00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:12.180\nCuz in the end, it does the exact\nsame thing as conditional forwarding.\n\n557\n00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.433\nIt accomplishes it in\na slightly different way, so\n\n558\n00:28:15.433 --> 00:28:18.316\nlet's delete our conditional forwarding.\n\n559\n00:28:18.316 --> 00:28:21.172\nAll right, so no more conditional\nforwarding contoso.com.\n\n560\n00:28:21.172 --> 00:28:26.288\nWe'll make sure we flush everything so\nthat we are back to scratch,\n\n561\n00:28:26.288 --> 00:28:29.680\nipconfig flushdns, we're good to go.\n\n562\n00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.190\nI'm not gonna try to ping it because\nthat's gonna create the name doesn't exist\n\n563\n00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.410\nrecord that I'm gonna have to flush again,\nright?\n\n564\n00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.546\nSo I'm not gonna try to ping it,\nbut at this point,\n\n565\n00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:41.880\nI won't be able to resolve anything\nthat ends in contoso.local.\n\n566\n00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.640\nSo we are going to set up a stub zone,\nfrom the name, you can probably infer,\n\n567\n00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.590\nif you didn't, I'm gonna tell you,\nit is another type of zone.\n\n568\n00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:53.596\nYou've seen it in our menu for our wizard,\nprimary, secondary, stub, right,\n\n569\n00:28:53.596 --> 00:28:55.524\nthat was that third option down there.\n\n570\n00:28:55.524 --> 00:29:01.690\nSo I'm gonna right click, new zone,\nNext, and we're gonna choose Stub.\n\n571\n00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.070\nAll right, and I can store this in\nActive Directory, just like primaries, and\n\n572\n00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:09.050\nmake it available to other DNS servers\nthat are on writable domain controllers,\n\n573\n00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:09.665\nif I want to.\n\n574\n00:29:09.665 --> 00:29:13.170\nI'll go ahead and leave it, I'll click\nNext, who do I want to replicate it to.\n\n575\n00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.000\nAll the DNS servers in the forest,\nall the DNS servers in the domain.\n\n576\n00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.390\nI'm gonna leave it on the default,\nI'll click Next, and\n\n577\n00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.880\nthen what is this zone's name?\n\n578\n00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:26.880\nWell that's contoso.local, and I'll\nclick Next, and then who's their master?\n\n579\n00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.345\nSo so far, it's almost just like\nsetting up conditional forwarding.\n\n580\n00:29:30.345 --> 00:29:32.180\nWhat's the name of the domain, and\n\n581\n00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.166\nwho's the master,\nwho's that authoritative server?\n\n582\n00:29:36.166 --> 00:29:39.640\n10.10.8.202, and\n\n583\n00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.320\nthere's a new option here, I say new,\nnew to us, cuz we haven't seen this yet.\n\n584\n00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.370\nUse the above servers to create\na local list of master servers.\n\n585\n00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:50.870\nThey probably have more than one DNS\nserver, most people do, right, two for\n\n586\n00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:51.790\nfall tolerance, minimum.\n\n587\n00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:57.370\nSo I can check that, and it'll actually\nreturn their other NS records as well,\n\n588\n00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.530\nwhich is pretty cool, so\nI'm gonna choose that.\n\n589\n00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.150\nBecause we're trying to eliminate\nthat single point of failure.\n\n590\n00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.210\nWith my conditional forwarding rule,\nI had one IP address for\n\n591\n00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.220\none of their DNS servers,\nand it was static.\n\n592\n00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.170\nSo if anything went wrong, their IP\naddress changed, I can't connect to that.\n\n593\n00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.970\nIf that DNS server was down, I would lose\nthat conditional forwarding capabilities\n\n594\n00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.960\nuntil they brought it back up,\nbecause there's only one IP address.\n\n595\n00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.920\nHere, I can list all their DNS servers,\nso that's a huge advantage already.\n\n596\n00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.330\nWe'll click Next and Finish, and\nI have a new zone called contoso.local.\n\n597\n00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.280\nAnd if I click on it,\nit says no, I can't load it up.\n\n598\n00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.180\nYou might be thinking well, Mike,\nyou don't have permissions.\n\n599\n00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.574\nWe saw that with secondaries, so\nwhy would stubs be any different?\n\n600\n00:30:40.574 --> 00:30:45.524\nRight-click, transfer from master,\nrefresh,\n\n601\n00:30:45.524 --> 00:30:49.490\nta-da, I actually have records coming in,\nall right?\n\n602\n00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:55.054\nSo this is a cool thing about stub zones,\nyou do not need permissions.\n\n603\n00:30:55.054 --> 00:30:57.960\nIn fact, let's try something here,\nCherokee, let's go wild and crazy.\n\n604\n00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:04.820\nNew zone, Next, stub, I'm just\nrepeating the steps, right, zone name.\n\n605\n00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:09.010\n&gt;&gt; But how much information\nare we really getting here?\n\n606\n00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.080\n&gt;&gt; That's the question,\n\n607\n00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.720\nisn't it, Microsoft.com,\nI don't know their IP address.\n\n608\n00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.190\nI forgot,\nI should have looked that up first,\n\n609\n00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.500\nI don't know their DNS server's name.\n\n610\n00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:23.108\nI can do a real quick whois,\nlet's check that out real fast.\n\n611\n00:31:23.108 --> 00:31:28.133\nLet me just go to my physical box, and\n\n612\n00:31:28.133 --> 00:31:34.636\ndo a whois lookup for, say, Microsoft.com.\n\n613\n00:31:34.636 --> 00:31:39.285\nLet it know that I'm a human,\nwhat do you think this is, cartas?\n\n614\n00:31:39.285 --> 00:31:42.270\n&gt;&gt; Are you human, [LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n615\n00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.124\n&gt;&gt; Heathrow, I think.\n\n616\n00:31:45.705 --> 00:31:46.509\nYep, evidently I got it right.\n\n617\n00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:47.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're a human.\n\n618\n00:31:47.582 --> 00:31:48.606\n&gt;&gt; I'm a Captcha cheater.\n\n619\n00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:51.734\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here we go, I am looking for\n\n620\n00:31:51.734 --> 00:31:52.860\ntheir DNS servers.\n\n621\n00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.770\nI can see, here's one of their\nDNS servers right there,\n\n622\n00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.933\nI'm gonna copy that,\nI'm gonna open up the command prompt.\n\n623\n00:31:58.933 --> 00:32:03.764\nAnd I'm gonna ping that, which means\nthat I can get their IP address.\n\n624\n00:32:03.764 --> 00:32:06.559\nI won't be able to copy this over so\nyou're gonna have to help me remember, or\n\n625\n00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:07.424\nwrite this down for me.\n\n626\n00:32:07.424 --> 00:32:09.137\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm writing,\ndon't ask me to remember.\n\n627\n00:32:09.137 --> 00:32:10.208\n&gt;&gt; Okay, 193.\n\n628\n00:32:10.208 --> 00:32:11.408\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; 221.\n\n629\n00:32:11.408 --> 00:32:12.764\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; 113.\n\n630\n00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:13.456\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n631\n00:32:13.456 --> 00:32:13.993\n&gt;&gt; 53.\n\n632\n00:32:13.993 --> 00:32:15.095\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n633\n00:32:15.095 --> 00:32:17.442\nnow we're gonna go back over to my VM, and\n\n634\n00:32:17.442 --> 00:32:21.212\nthis is where we were setting up\nthe stub zone for Microsoft.com.\n\n635\n00:32:21.212 --> 00:32:22.333\nAnd what was that address?\n\n636\n00:32:22.333 --> 00:32:23.822\n&gt;&gt; 192-\n&gt;&gt; 192.\n\n637\n00:32:23.822 --> 00:32:25.486\n&gt;&gt; .221-\n&gt;&gt; 221.\n\n638\n00:32:25.486 --> 00:32:26.429\n&gt;&gt; 113.\n\n639\n00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:27.605\n&gt;&gt; Okay, was it a 192, 193?\n\n640\n00:32:27.605 --> 00:32:28.689\n192 is-\n&gt;&gt; 193.\n\n641\n00:32:28.689 --> 00:32:29.628\n&gt;&gt; 193.\n&gt;&gt; Did I say 192?\n\n642\n00:32:29.628 --> 00:32:30.645\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I think.\n\n643\n00:32:30.645 --> 00:32:32.093\nMaybe or I heard it wrong.\n\n644\n00:32:32.093 --> 00:32:34.877\n193221.\n\n645\n00:32:34.877 --> 00:32:36.020\n&gt;&gt; Correct, 113.\n\n646\n00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.877\n&gt;&gt; 113.\n\n647\n00:32:36.877 --> 00:32:37.621\n&gt;&gt; 53.\n\n648\n00:32:37.621 --> 00:32:38.601\n&gt;&gt; 53.\n\n649\n00:32:38.601 --> 00:32:40.577\nThe DNS port number, how about that.\n\n650\n00:32:40.577 --> 00:32:44.814\nAnd look, it resolved, everything's okay,\nI'll create a list of master servers,\n\n651\n00:32:44.814 --> 00:32:46.276\nI'll click Next and Finish.\n\n652\n00:32:46.276 --> 00:32:50.846\nAnd I go to microsoft.com, it says it did\nnot load, I'll transfer from Master and\n\n653\n00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:51.827\nI'll Refresh And\n\n654\n00:32:51.827 --> 00:32:56.031\nit's gonna take a little bit longer\nbecause it's not local to me right now.\n\n655\n00:32:56.031 --> 00:33:01.280\nNow, I haven't done this ahead of time so\nI probably should have tested this out.\n\n656\n00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:04.200\nThere are one or\ntwo things that could make this go wrong.\n\n657\n00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.159\nFirewalls being one,\n\n658\n00:33:07.159 --> 00:33:12.335\nnot using standard port numbers\ncould cause an issue with this.\n\n659\n00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:15.650\nBut I was really hoping I could get\nthis to work real fast for you guys.\n\n660\n00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.520\nIf we take out the other stuff, if we take\nout the fact that I'm on a virtual network\n\n661\n00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:25.410\nhere and we've got firewalls between us\nand then at Microsoft, this would work.\n\n662\n00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.330\nDog gone it, I really hoped I\ncould show you, there we go.\n\n663\n00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.737\nI was just impatient again.\n\n664\n00:33:28.737 --> 00:33:31.060\n&gt;&gt; We've got to work on that, Mike.\n\n665\n00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:31.803\n&gt;&gt; I do, don't I?\n\n666\n00:33:31.803 --> 00:33:34.188\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like some woosah meditation.\n\n667\n00:33:34.188 --> 00:33:35.351\n&gt;&gt; It's all the pressure from that\n\n668\n00:33:35.351 --> 00:33:37.300\nlittle clock over there\ntelling me to hurry the time.\n\n669\n00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.020\n&gt;&gt; I know, well the clock is,\nwe've been out of time.\n\n670\n00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.733\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well I don't have that much more to go,\n\n671\n00:33:42.733 --> 00:33:44.601\nso should we stick around?\n\n672\n00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:47.149\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I have set up a stub zone for\n\n673\n00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:49.218\nmicrosoft.com, right?\n\n674\n00:33:49.218 --> 00:33:52.935\nIt looks like I'm missing some A records,\ninteresting enough, so I might\n\n675\n00:33:52.935 --> 00:33:57.009\nnot actually have success, but the point\nis I didn't call up Microsoft, right?\n\n676\n00:33:57.009 --> 00:34:00.947\nYou saw me go find the IP address\nof their DNS server manually and\n\n677\n00:34:00.947 --> 00:34:02.560\njust add it in here.\n\n678\n00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.448\nAnd Cherokee made, she got it correct\nwhen she pointed out that what\n\n679\n00:34:07.448 --> 00:34:10.810\ninformation are we really\ngetting from them?\n\n680\n00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, do you have that Microsoft clout?\n\n681\n00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.362\nYou said you gotta have that trust there,\nso how much do they really trust us?\n\n682\n00:34:15.362 --> 00:34:18.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you look at the one\nthat did work contoso.local,\n\n683\n00:34:18.862 --> 00:34:23.820\nI don't have every single name and IP\naddress of all of their computers, right?\n\n684\n00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.033\nAll I have is something known as the SOA,\nthe start of authority.\n\n685\n00:34:27.033 --> 00:34:30.681\nJust the first record that's created in\nany zone that you create that tells you\n\n686\n00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:35.450\nwho the authoritative server is for that\nparticular namespace amongst other things.\n\n687\n00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.032\nI have their NS record, who their name\nserver is, the name of their name server.\n\n688\n00:34:40.032 --> 00:34:43.789\nBut I can't connect to a name,\nso I also get the A record for\n\n689\n00:34:43.789 --> 00:34:48.720\nthat name server, so that I can now\ngo their DNS server's server 02.\n\n690\n00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.695\nServer 02 is 1010A200 and\nnow I can connect to them, and\n\n691\n00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:52.951\nthat's all I'm getting.\n\n692\n00:34:52.951 --> 00:34:56.440\nAnd that's publicly available information,\nall right?\n\n693\n00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.790\nIt's not anything that I don't know,\nyou know, you'll, I read a lot of\n\n694\n00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:05.020\ncomparisons between conditional\nforwarding and stub zones, right?\n\n695\n00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:10.270\nAnd people will say, stub zones,\nI don't like exposing that information.\n\n696\n00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.863\nWell I understand that, but\nif you're publicly facing DNS,\n\n697\n00:35:13.863 --> 00:35:16.015\nyou are exposing that information.\n\n698\n00:35:16.015 --> 00:35:20.382\nOtherwise people can't find your DNS\nserver and they can't resolve names and\n\n699\n00:35:20.382 --> 00:35:21.979\nconnect to your resources.\n\n700\n00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.655\nSo there's really not\na big security issue.\n\n701\n00:35:26.655 --> 00:35:30.720\nHeck, we could do it\nfrom a command prompt.\n\n702\n00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.010\nWe know Microsoft's IP address for\ntheir DNS server,\n\n703\n00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.238\nlet's see,\nNewegg should probably be a better one.\n\n704\n00:35:37.238 --> 00:35:39.560\nLet's do one more example.\n\n705\n00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.687\nI know we're out of time, Cherokee.\n\n706\n00:35:42.687 --> 00:35:46.793\nLet's do one more example that I've\nworked just a little bit better than that\n\n707\n00:35:46.793 --> 00:35:48.730\nMicrosoft one, I think.\n\n708\n00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:54.371\nLet's do a whois for newegg.com.\n\n709\n00:35:54.371 --> 00:35:57.800\nAnd there's one of their DNS servers.\n\n710\n00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.913\nI'll just grab one here.\n\n711\n00:35:58.913 --> 00:36:01.778\nAnd I'm going to go to\nmy command prompt and\n\n712\n00:36:01.778 --> 00:36:07.860\nwe're gonna ping, Again,\nI got his IP address, right?\n\n713\n00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.699\nAnd then I am just gonna\nstay right here and\n\n714\n00:36:09.699 --> 00:36:12.287\nshow you that this information\nis really not that secret.\n\n715\n00:36:12.287 --> 00:36:14.315\nI'm gonna do nslookup, all right?\n\n716\n00:36:14.315 --> 00:36:21.832\nI'm using Google's DNS server but\nI can type in server 193.1, oops.\n\n717\n00:36:21.832 --> 00:36:22.809\n&gt;&gt; You put the two.\n\n718\n00:36:22.809 --> 00:36:23.521\n&gt;&gt; I did, didn't I?\n\n719\n00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:29.108\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry if I did say that,\nI didn't mean to mess you up.\n\n720\n00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:29.843\n&gt;&gt; 91.21.\n\n721\n00:36:29.843 --> 00:36:34.870\nAll right, now I'm pointing my\ntool nslookup to their DNS server.\n\n722\n00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:39.974\nI'm gonna do set type=soa and\nthen newegg.com,\n\n723\n00:36:39.974 --> 00:36:43.304\nand there's their soa, right?\n\n724\n00:36:43.304 --> 00:36:47.543\nTheir refresh intervals,\nwho their authoritative server is,\n\n725\n00:36:47.543 --> 00:36:52.970\nthe information that people are saying I\ndon't want to give up, well there it is.\n\n726\n00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.835\nI could do set type=ns.\n\n727\n00:36:56.835 --> 00:36:59.610\nAnd then newegg.com, right?\n\n728\n00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:04.010\nAnd there's all of their name servers,\nincluding the A records that go with those\n\n729\n00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:06.324\nname servers so\nthat I can connect to them.\n\n730\n00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:10.315\nSo my point is I understand that\nthere's a concern with exposing some of\n\n731\n00:37:10.315 --> 00:37:15.880\nthat information and we don't wanna do it\njust blindly and say it doesn't matter.\n\n732\n00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.301\nBut I want you to really think about what\nyou're exposing and what the risks are to\n\n733\n00:37:19.301 --> 00:37:22.736\nexposing that, and whether or not you're\nalready exposing that information.\n\n734\n00:37:22.736 --> 00:37:26.471\nSo something to think about anyways as far\nas security goes when it comes to stub\n\n735\n00:37:26.471 --> 00:37:27.037\nzones, and\n\n736\n00:37:27.037 --> 00:37:31.140\ndefinitely not a complete in-depth\nconversation on the security involved.\n\n737\n00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.550\nBut I do think sometimes, if you go out\nand do some research on stub zones,\n\n738\n00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.410\nthere are some people out there\nthat have made these blogs that\n\n739\n00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.397\nmake stub zones sound horribly insecure.\n\n740\n00:37:39.397 --> 00:37:42.609\nAnd I think they're fantastic\nbecause they allow me to do this\n\n741\n00:37:42.609 --> 00:37:44.040\nconditional forwarding.\n\n742\n00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.938\nAnd remember I said it's\ndynamic conditional forwarding,\n\n743\n00:37:46.938 --> 00:37:48.081\nwhat did I mean by that?\n\n744\n00:37:48.081 --> 00:37:51.870\nI didn't manually create these records,\nright?\n\n745\n00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.225\nThese were pulled from Contoso.\n\n746\n00:37:53.225 --> 00:37:57.848\nRemember I told it who the master was,\nit reached out, it did an SOA query, an NS\n\n747\n00:37:57.848 --> 00:38:03.300\nquery, and an A record query for those\nname servers, and it got the information.\n\n748\n00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.022\nWhat that means is,\nif in this case contoso.local,\n\n749\n00:38:07.022 --> 00:38:09.759\nchanges their DNS servers IP address.\n\n750\n00:38:09.759 --> 00:38:13.580\nOr adds new DNS servers or\nremoves DNS servers.\n\n751\n00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.338\nEvery time I talk to them,\nI will update this information.\n\n752\n00:38:17.338 --> 00:38:18.750\nIt will be updated automatically.\n\n753\n00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.622\n&gt;&gt; And that's not what we saw previously\nwith just conditional forwarding.\n\n754\n00:38:21.622 --> 00:38:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\nwe had to do that very manually.\n\n755\n00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.737\nWith this, that's why we call it dynamic\nconditional forwarding because it's gonna\n\n756\n00:38:28.737 --> 00:38:30.070\nkeep this information up to date.\n\n757\n00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:34.050\nIt checks in with Contoso.local stub\nzones are going to refresh at our\n\n758\n00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:37.288\ndefault refresh interval\nwhen normal zones replicate,\n\n759\n00:38:37.288 --> 00:38:40.670\nwhich is 15 minutes by default,\nunless you change that.\n\n760\n00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:44.584\nSo every 15 minutes it'll reach out and\ntalk to these guys, and\n\n761\n00:38:44.584 --> 00:38:47.660\nsee if their information has changed,\nall right?\n\n762\n00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:53.333\nSo I think Cherokee, that's a good\nexplanation hopefully for stub zones.\n\n763\n00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:56.205\nAs far as usage goes let me\ndo point out one more thing.\n\n764\n00:38:56.205 --> 00:38:59.025\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've already shown you this drawing,\n\n765\n00:38:59.025 --> 00:39:02.610\nactually I used it for conditional\nforwarding, but the same thing applies for\n\n766\n00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:03.220\nstub zones.\n\n767\n00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.202\nCould be an external business partner\nthat I want to be able to resolve names\n\n768\n00:39:07.202 --> 00:39:10.440\nquickly, but I want that dynamic\ncapability of stub zones.\n\n769\n00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.340\nCould be internally for that same\nscenario we talked about earlier.\n\n770\n00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.672\nThe only difference now\nis with a stub zone,\n\n771\n00:39:16.672 --> 00:39:21.290\nif their information changes it will be\nupdated automatically through replication.\n\n772\n00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.852\nI don't have to change it.\n\n773\n00:39:22.852 --> 00:39:29.431\nSo that's a good look I think at some\nof things we do when we're configuring,\n\n774\n00:39:29.431 --> 00:39:35.420\nmanaging our DNS server, as far as\nsetting up rules to resolve names.\n\n775\n00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:40.103\nWe looked at resolving external names,\nforwarding,\n\n776\n00:39:40.103 --> 00:39:43.630\nconditional forwarding and stub zones.\n\n777\n00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.561\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nI know we've gone through quite a few\n\n778\n00:39:45.561 --> 00:39:49.440\nepisodes here, but that's amazing because\nI always say the more the merrier.\n\n779\n00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.707\nSo thank you for that Mike.\n\n780\n00:39:50.707 --> 00:39:52.210\nAnd thank you guys for joining us as well.\n\n781\n00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.429\nHopefully we've shed some\nlight on some DNS and\n\n782\n00:39:54.429 --> 00:39:56.490\nhow it relates here in server 2012 R2.\n\n783\n00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.598\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n784\n00:39:59.598 --> 00:40:01.410\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n785\n00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.940\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n786\n00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:10.963\n[MUSIC]\n\n787\n00:40:10.963 -->

00:00:10.710\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.260\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.910\nYou're watching the NCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 show.\n\n6\n00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.550\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're gonna be taking a look at IP version\n\n7\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.850\n4 and IP version 6 interoperability,\nwhich is kind of a big word here.\n\n8\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.670\nSo for us, as we get started in\nunderstanding this better, we have Ms.\n\n9\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.360\nCherokee Boose to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.540\nCherokee, how are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.680\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.030\nYeah, interoperability's kind of like, hey\nwe've already talk about IPB 4 and IPB 6.\n\n13\n00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.820\nBut specifically in this show, we'll be\ntaking a look at, well how we can have\n\n14\n00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.010\nmachines that are running on different\nnetwork types to be able to communicate\n\n15\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.680\nwith each other because, well, let's face\nit, you may come across that situation.\n\n16\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.590\nWe're in this weird transitional mode\n\n17\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.500\nwhere we're trying to get everyone on\nthe same page and move forward with IPV6.\n\n18\n00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.430\nIts been happening for over a decade\nnow but not everyone's quite there yet\n\n19\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.520\nso, in the other show when we\nwere talking about IPV4 and\n\n20\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.865\nIPV6, i was trying to stress\nto you how important it was.\n\n21\n00:01:14.865 --> 00:01:19.485\nTo familiarize yourself with\nthose address prefixes.\n\n22\n00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:23.735\nSo if we can begin this show, I just\nwant to start by reminding you again,\n\n23\n00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:27.582\nif we take a look at me screen I\nwant to show some different prefix.\n\n24\n00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:30.932\nBut, specifically, like I said in\nthis show, we'll be focusing and\n\n25\n00:01:30.932 --> 00:01:36.622\nnarrowing in on a few type of what\nare called transitional mechanisms,\n\n26\n00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:38.530\ntransitional technologies-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n27\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.477\n&gt;&gt; You may hear, so we'll start\nwith something called six to four.\n\n28\n00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.982\nAnd we'll also take a look at Teredo.\n\n29\n00:01:44.982 --> 00:01:48.330\nAnd we'll take a look at another\ntechnology called ISATAP.\n\n30\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.880\nAnd the reason I'm pointing this out\nto you right now is because the prefix\n\n31\n00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.880\nis going to be an integral part\nof the address to clue you in and\n\n32\n00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.710\nlet you know, give you a clue\nabout maybe if you're studying, or\n\n33\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.400\nyou're taking an exam, or\nyou're just configuring a machine.\n\n34\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.720\nWhen you're looking at output\nfrom some type of tool,\n\n35\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.360\nyou'll want to be able to just\nbe able to identify those.\n\n36\n00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.440\nSo just knowing the structure, we'll take\na look at that a little more in depth, but\n\n37\n00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.900\nI just wanted to remind you\nreally how important that is.\n\n38\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.350\nNow I've mentioned this weird\nstate that we're in, right?\n\n39\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.770\nSo some companies, especially if they have\nany kind of regulatory compliance or maybe\n\n40\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.560\nit's like dealing with the government and\nthey say look, I just want everyone to be.\n\n41\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.430\nThey've issued some types of,\nwhat's the word?\n\n42\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.950\nThose federal reserves and\nthey said, and this was years ago.\n\n43\n00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.432\nThey even started doing this your networks\nneed to be able to support both IPv4 and\n\n44\n00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:49.251\nIPv6.\n\n45\n00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:56.180\nSo if I have a site here\nrunning IPv6 only and\n\n46\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.270\nanother branch location also running\nIPv6 only well then what's the issue,\n\n47\n00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.240\nhow do I communicate running over\na IPv4 network like the Internet?\n\n48\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.500\nWell that's where these transitional\nmechanisms come into play.\n\n49\n00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.950\nAnd we need to establish virtual\nlinks with these technologies.\n\n50\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.200\nSo that's what we'll be\nlooking at in this show, now.\n\n51\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.850\nDon't let these diagrams scare you.\n\n52\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.700\nI know there is a lot there.\n\n53\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.870\nAnd I'm gonna try to explain\nit as best as I can.\n\n54\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.730\nBecause you might even if you've tried to\nlook at these concept independently and\n\n55\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.850\nyou've done like internet searches,\nI mean there's just so\n\n56\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.330\nmuch information out there.\n\n57\n00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.970\nIt can get a little overwhelming so\n\n58\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.180\nI'll try to break it down\ninto a more simplistic form.\n\n59\n00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.160\nYou don't need to know everything about\nit and I'll highlight the most, I guess,\n\n60\n00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.310\nfundamental concepts that\nwe need to know here.\n\n61\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.790\nThere are tons of\ntransition mechanisms and\n\n62\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.150\ndifferent types of technologies out there.\n\n63\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.350\nI mean every kind of potential\nconfiguration has been thought of,\n\n64\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.750\nand people come off with many\nvariations and variants.\n\n65\n00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.790\nSo, don't let that bog you down.\n\n66\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.930\nSome key terms that I'd like to cover,\nso, if I have my two networks here,\n\n67\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.430\nhow are we gonna go ahead and\nfacilitate this virtual link.\n\n68\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.180\nI need to go ahead and utilize something\nthat's called a tunnel broker service.\n\n69\n00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.350\nAnd what that does, a tunnel broker,\n\n70\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.250\nwell it is a service that provides that\nvirtual link, that network tunnel.\n\n71\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.790\nAnd if you wanted to delve a little deeper\ninto these concepts, I've noted some RFCs.\n\n72\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.420\nRFC 3053 is going to be\nexplaining an IPv6 tunnel broker,\n\n73\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.770\nand then you also have a more\ngeneric explanation of\n\n74\n00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.830\nyou can really tunnel over anything\nin how you go ahead and set it up.\n\n75\n00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.770\nThat's going to be noted in RFC 2473.\n\n76\n00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.340\nNow, what I'm looking at\nhere is this network.\n\n77\n00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.280\nI have regular components,\nall my coordinate work services,\n\n78\n00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.210\njust like I would in a regular network,\nincluding things like a firewall.\n\n79\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.540\nSecurity is still important here.\n\n80\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.320\nWhen you establish a tunnel\nwith a tunnel broker service,\n\n81\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.670\nit's not like other types of\ntunnels like a VPN tunnel.\n\n82\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.110\nYou're not gonna have to maintain\nany kind of connection section and\n\n83\n00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.590\ntermination data so encryption is\nnot going to be provided here.\n\n84\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.450\nThis is a more simplistic\nconfiguration that is just allowing\n\n85\n00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.300\nbasically encapsulation to occur.\n\n86\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.940\nSo what I have here is, let's say, a note,\n\n87\n00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.460\nwithing this IPV6 network\nhas generated a packet.\n\n88\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.080\nSo this is my IPV6 packet.\n\n89\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.160\nHow do I get it to my other IPV6 network?\n\n90\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.594\nWell, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take\nthat original packet with the original\n\n91\n00:05:51.594 --> 00:05:55.915\nheader information and I'm going to\nencapsulate it inside of an IPv4 packet.\n\n92\n00:05:58.424 --> 00:06:02.460\nAll right, we're just gonna go ahead and\ngroup those for this demonstration.\n\n93\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:09.200\nNow, whenever I go ahead and encapsulate\nthe IPv6 packet inside of the IPv4,\n\n94\n00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.630\nyou'll see that the actually\nprotocol field is changed to 41,\n\n95\n00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.570\nto indicate that it is\nan encapsulated IPv6 packet.\n\n96\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.470\nSometimes you'll hear protocol 41,\nor proto41 tunnel, and\n\n97\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.670\nthat's just a different\nway of explaining this.\n\n98\n00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.420\nSo, then I can actually send from my\ntunnel entry point or exit point,\n\n99\n00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.370\nwhich is going to be a tunnel end node.\n\n100\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.090\nAnd go ahead and\nsend it across that IPv4 network and\n\n101\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.050\nthen when I get to this other end point,\nso,\n\n102\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.520\nthis actual IPv4 header information,\nthe source and the destination\n\n103\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.620\naddresses are gonna actually be\nthe addresses of these two endpoints here.\n\n104\n00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.460\nAnd here, looking at this diagram, I\n\n105\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.490\nhave entry/exit point because you may just\nhave a unidirectional communication but\n\n106\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.410\nyou can also configure it to\nbe bidirectional as well.\n\n107\n00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.090\nSo then over here on\nthis side we go ahead and\n\n108\n00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.760\nungroup it Decapsulate\nour little IPv6 packet.\n\n109\n00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.810\nAnd then the local area network,\nbut go ahead and\n\n110\n00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.460\nroute that, just like regular traffic.\n\n111\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.160\nSo, I think that's the easiest way to\ngo ahead and explain this concept.\n\n112\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.840\nIn certain situations,\n\n113\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.640\nyou may think okay, well,\nyou just showed us IPv6 running over IPv4.\n\n114\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.340\nBut like I said you can encapsulate\nmultiple types of traffic,\n\n115\n00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.430\nso that's why there are so many of these\ntransitional mechanisms and technologies,\n\n116\n00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.420\nbecause, well, a lot of different\nnetwork configurations exist.\n\n117\n00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.789\nSo you may see something like IPv4\nnetworks tunneling through IPv6 as well,\n\n118\n00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:50.098\nand there are different variations\nof that As a matter of fact,\n\n119\n00:07:50.098 --> 00:07:53.378\nyou may even hear something\ncalled six to four.\n\n120\n00:07:53.378 --> 00:07:57.408\nLooking at the structure\nhere of our addresses,\n\n121\n00:07:57.408 --> 00:08:02.714\nsix to four is going to be A tunneling\nmechanism that we can use and\n\n122\n00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:06.570\nit's gonna be used for\npublic IP addresses.\n\n123\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.270\nSo, it's gonna take those public\nIP addresses and tunnel them so\n\n124\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.080\nthat they can be communicated.\n\n125\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.660\nSo, if we look at the structure here,\nyou're gonna see the syntax and it's going\n\n126\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:22.930\nto be based off of the IPv4 address of\nthe external interface on an IPv6 router.\n\n127\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.200\nSo just being familiar with the way\nthese addresses look because if\n\n128\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.787\nyou're ever presented with an output like\nan IP config all or something like that,\n\n129\n00:08:34.787 --> 00:08:40.552\nyou should be able to understand where\nthese addresses are coming from.\n\n130\n00:08:40.552 --> 00:08:44.825\nSo what you're looking at here\nis just a basic structure and\n\n131\n00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:49.200\nexplanation of the structure\nof the IP address here.\n\n132\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:56.451\nAnd Microsoft doesn't\nspecifically call out 6to4, but\n\n133\n00:08:56.451 --> 00:09:03.130\n6 over 4 is one of these\ncore transition mechanisms.\n\n134\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.140\nAs a matter of fact,\nwe'll look at something called ISATAP\n\n135\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.580\nthat is specifically called out that\nis a variation that builds upon that.\n\n136\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.657\nSo I just wanna, again, express how\nimportant it is to understand and\n\n137\n00:09:15.657 --> 00:09:17.993\nnotice those prefixes as well.\n\n138\n00:09:17.993 --> 00:09:19.660\nSo what is ISATAP?\n\n139\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.200\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n140\n00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.987\nISATAP stands for Intra-Site\nAutomatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol.\n\n141\n00:09:25.987 --> 00:09:28.938\nAnd if I have a technology like\n6to4 that does this for me,\n\n142\n00:09:28.938 --> 00:09:32.610\nyou're maybe thinking well, Cherokee,\nwhy would I need another one?\n\n143\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.520\nWell, I can't answer\nthat because they're so\n\n144\n00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.880\nmany, but\nin certain situations ISATAP is required.\n\n145\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.440\nBecause I said, hey, 6to4 works for\n\n146\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.880\npublic addresses, but what if we\ndon't need to deal with public IPs?\n\n147\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.300\nWhat if we're just trying\nto communicate internally?\n\n148\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.645\nWell, ISATAP provides a solution for\nthat, so\n\n149\n00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:56.465\nit can be configured with both public and\nprivate IP addresses.\n\n150\n00:09:56.465 --> 00:10:00.855\nAnd, as a matter of fact, you don't\neven need to leave, exit, a network.\n\n151\n00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:06.125\nYou can even just have a mixture,\na combination of both\n\n152\n00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:10.555\ndevices that support and run on IPv4 and\ndevices that run on IPv6.\n\n153\n00:10:10.555 --> 00:10:15.450\nAnd you're ISATAP device, so\nyou can configure your machine, and\n\n154\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.880\nwe will configure a server\nas an ISATAP router.\n\n155\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.340\nAnd that router acts as a translator so\n\n156\n00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.830\nthat those devices can't\ncommunicate with each other.\n\n157\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.330\nIn most situations, newer operating\nsystems ever since Vista and\n\n158\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.120\nServer 2008,\nthey support something called Dual Stack,\n\n159\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.470\nwhich allows you to run both IPv4 and\nIPv6 addressing schemes.\n\n160\n00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.324\nBut for some reason maybe you have\na device that doesn't support one or\n\n161\n00:10:45.324 --> 00:10:49.256\nthe other or maybe you're not allowed\nto go ahead and run that version.\n\n162\n00:10:49.256 --> 00:10:54.420\nSo that's where this particular\ntechnology comes into play.\n\n163\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, I think you make a good point\nhere when we start taking a look at some\n\n164\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.926\nof the reasons.\n\n165\n00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:02.077\nThe tunneling technologies\nthat you showed us before,\n\n166\n00:11:02.077 --> 00:11:06.633\nthey really are good as long as we're\ngoing from one network to another network,\n\n167\n00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:09.332\nand going across maybe\nan IPv4 address space.\n\n168\n00:11:09.332 --> 00:11:13.689\nBut the very fact is, there are a lot of\ncompanies that are not transitioning over\n\n169\n00:11:13.689 --> 00:11:17.000\nto IPv6, because there is some\ndifficulty involved in it.\n\n170\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.810\nSo in this sense, ISATAP is one of those\ntransition technologies that help us\n\n171\n00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.787\nto move forward that\nmigration from IPv4 to\n\n172\n00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:30.530\nIPv6 as we start to actually\ndo something like this.\n\n173\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.050\nSo even though it's actually there and\navailable for us, it is a technology that\n\n174\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.000\nyou need to make sure that you're\nfamiliar with on the exam.\n\n175\n00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.338\nAnd it's funny because I remember reading\nsome of the Microsoft documentation.\n\n176\n00:11:42.338 --> 00:11:47.580\nLike look, do not use this unless you have\nto, essentially is what it comes down to.\n\n177\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.090\nSo, that's why you're looking at it.\n\n178\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.920\nBecause more than likely, especially\non the exam they're gonna call out that\n\n179\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.670\nweird technology that Microsoft is saying\ndon't use it unless you have to and\n\n180\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.260\nthey're gonna put you in that scenario.\n\n181\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.956\nSo think about the ideas of transitioning\nfrom you wanna transition your IPv4 over\n\n182\n00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:07.970\nto IPv6, but you know that there's some\nthat's not gonna transition very easily.\n\n183\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.450\nSo ISATAP is gonna be one of those\nthat you may end up using, or\n\n184\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.050\nthe situation that Cherokee\nwas actually mentioning.\n\n185\n00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.288\nWhere you have some devices that just\naren't going to be able to handle both\n\n186\n00:12:18.288 --> 00:12:19.910\nIPv4, IPv6.\n\n187\n00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.790\nSo those are kind of some of the scenarios\nthat you might want to think about\n\n188\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.440\nas you choose which particular\ntype of technology here.\n\n189\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.640\nSo Cherokee,\nwhat else do we need to know about ISATAP?\n\n190\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.950\n&gt;&gt; So you pointed out a really good\nnote there Ronnie because I mean,\n\n191\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.780\nI'm sorry if this is your baby and\nyou've created ISATAP.\n\n192\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.700\nIt's not the easiest tool to work with,\n\n193\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.968\nI'm just going to be\nhonest with you right now.\n\n194\n00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:45.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And that's putting it mildly.\n\n195\n00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.841\nBut like Ronnie said,\n\n196\n00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:50.890\nthis is like basically you're putting\na Band-Aid over a particular situation.\n\n197\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.570\nSo the end goal is to get\neveryone on the same page and\n\n198\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:00.150\nto get those devices supported for both or\njust moved over to IPv6 all together.\n\n199\n00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.260\nBut, until then,\nthis is the temporary fix or solution.\n\n200\n00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.810\nThere are some drawbacks though.\n\n201\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:12.010\nA lot of times we're running network\naddress translation within our networks,\n\n202\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.940\nthat's going to pose a problem,\na limitation of ISATAP.\n\n203\n00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.227\nSo you may also see another\ntechnology that is called out,\n\n204\n00:13:20.227 --> 00:13:22.514\nspecifically called Teredo.\n\n205\n00:13:22.514 --> 00:13:25.895\nI like saying Torito,\nI guess that's my Southern flare,\n\n206\n00:13:25.895 --> 00:13:29.083\nkinda sounds like Dorito but\nany way you want to say it.\n\n207\n00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:31.160\n[LAUGH] That's going to be.\n\n208\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.410\nThere's also, and it's funny guys,\nI'm not even joking.\n\n209\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.060\nIf you did an Internet search for\nthese transitional technologies,\n\n210\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.520\nyou'll see a slew of them.\n\n211\n00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.240\nYou'll even see something called\nMoredo which is gonna be a NIC\n\n212\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.820\nbased version of this Teredo\nimplementation as well.\n\n213\n00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.830\nBut Teredo is going to\nallow the support for Macs,\n\n214\n00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.960\nso just keep that in mind as well.\n\n215\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:59.070\nThere are different ways you can configure\nTeredo, there are Teredo servers online.\n\n216\n00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.850\nActually, just let me switch over here and\nI'll show you.\n\n217\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.979\nMicrosoft's address for\ntheir Teredo servers,\n\n218\n00:14:05.979 --> 00:14:11.198\ntheir design is going to be\nteredo.ipv6.microsoft.com.\n\n219\n00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:17.077\nAnd this is the prefix to go ahead and\nindicate a teredo address.\n\n220\n00:14:17.077 --> 00:14:21.640\nI would say that this particular\ntechnology is even more cumbersome than\n\n221\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.576\nISATAP because at least with ISATAP you\nhave some control over the situation,\n\n222\n00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:28.470\nit's your devices.\n\n223\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.517\nBut with Teredo you're actually\nrelying on that Teredo relay, and\n\n224\n00:14:32.517 --> 00:14:35.788\nwell what happens if you\nlose Internet connectivity?\n\n225\n00:14:35.788 --> 00:14:37.790\nOr that server goes down?\n\n226\n00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.647\nYou're relying on someone\nelse's trust in that capacity.\n\n227\n00:14:40.647 --> 00:14:45.170\nSo again, not a perfect solution,\njust be familiar with it.\n\n228\n00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.979\nAnd I put the steps of how to\nconfigure that In the show notes as\n\n229\n00:14:49.979 --> 00:14:54.332\nwell as the TechNet link for\nTeredo, so that you have.\n\n230\n00:14:54.332 --> 00:14:59.125\nThey do provide good documentation for\nthat, if you have to go that route,\n\n231\n00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:00.660\njust keep that in mind.\n\n232\n00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:07.485\nAll right, so let me explain to\nyou what our lab topology will\n\n233\n00:15:07.485 --> 00:15:13.265\nlook at because we're gonna be\nsetting up an ISATAP server here.\n\n234\n00:15:13.265 --> 00:15:16.609\nIt can get a little confusing because we\nare working with a lot of devices and\n\n235\n00:15:16.609 --> 00:15:20.350\nI wanna make sure you really understand\nwhat we're dealing with first.\n\n236\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:26.470\nSo looking at this network,\nI have a domain controller PLABDCO1,\n\n237\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.870\nI have a domain member PLABDMO1.\n\n238\n00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:38.803\nAnd then I also have PLABSA01 which\nis going to act as our ISATAP router.\n\n239\n00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:43.723\nNow all of these three\ndevices that I just mentioned\n\n240\n00:15:43.723 --> 00:15:47.957\nare going to be utilizing IPv4, except for\n\n241\n00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:53.231\nmy ISATAP router is going to\nbe that translator for us.\n\n242\n00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:57.392\nAnd what it's going to provide\nis the ability for our clients,\n\n243\n00:15:57.392 --> 00:15:59.208\nwe have PLAV-WIN 801.\n\n244\n00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:02.799\nA machine that's running\nWindows 8.1 over here,\n\n245\n00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:05.364\nwhich is only an IP version 6 device.\n\n246\n00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:09.133\nNow, in reality,\nWindows 8.1 does support both.\n\n247\n00:16:09.133 --> 00:16:14.340\nBut what I've done is I've disabled\nIP version 4 for this demonstration.\n\n248\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:20.000\nAnd I've also disabled IP version 6\non our domain number over here so\n\n249\n00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.030\nthat we can prove this concept.\n\n250\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.990\nAnd just show that this isotope router\nshould do what it's supposed to do.\n\n251\n00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.540\nSo let's go ahead and get that started.\n\n252\n00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.770\nAnd in practice labs, so\n\n253\n00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:36.610\nyou guys have the ability to follow along,\nI have shortened up some of the work.\n\n254\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:37.770\nLike I said, I went ahead and\n\n255\n00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.480\ndid some of this configuration,\njust to make it shorter for this show.\n\n256\n00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.044\nSo if you wanted to go through and look\nat their steps compared to my show notes,\n\n257\n00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:48.272\nhopefully you guys can follow along.\n\n258\n00:16:48.272 --> 00:16:53.125\nOkay, the first thing I wanna\ngo here is I want to show you\n\n259\n00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:57.268\nhow I have disabled IP\nversion 6 on PLABDMO1.\n\n260\n00:16:57.268 --> 00:17:00.596\nSo what I'm gonna do is an IP config all,\njust so\n\n261\n00:17:00.596 --> 00:17:03.776\nwe can take a look at\nhow that's configured.\n\n262\n00:17:03.776 --> 00:17:08.175\nNow, what I did was I went under\nthe graphical user interface and\n\n263\n00:17:08.175 --> 00:17:11.940\njust unchecked that from\nmy IP version 6 properties.\n\n264\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.190\nIn real life, there are dependencies\nthat you'll need to go ahead and\n\n265\n00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:23.110\nperform registry edits if you wanna\ncompletely axe IPv6 from a device.\n\n266\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:27.100\nIt's not really recommended because you do\nhave dependencies and other technologies.\n\n267\n00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.810\nMicrosoft has technologies such as\nDirectAccess, as well as third party\n\n268\n00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:39.990\ntechnology such as Dropbox that rely\non the way that IPv6 communicates.\n\n269\n00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.460\nSo you may inadvertently break\nsomething if you try to go ahead and\n\n270\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.160\njust turn it off for no reason.\n\n271\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.320\nSo what we're looking at here is the way\nthat your practice labs are configured,\n\n272\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.020\nyou have one network interface for\ncommunication for the machines themselves.\n\n273\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.880\nAnd in this demonstration,\n\n274\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.290\nwe will actually be modifying\nour secondary adapter.\n\n275\n00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.970\nSo we'll be looking at Ethernet II.\n\n276\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.982\nSo you can see here, Ethernet II\ndoes have an IP version 4 address.\n\n277\n00:18:08.982 --> 00:18:14.448\nI've went ahead and\nset that statically at 192.168.0.20.\n\n278\n00:18:14.448 --> 00:18:16.996\nBut you don't see an IPv6\naddress noted here, and\n\n279\n00:18:16.996 --> 00:18:19.317\nthat's what I wanted to go ahead and\nshow you.\n\n280\n00:18:19.317 --> 00:18:23.947\nOkay, I'd also like to show you how\nI did configure the other machine,\n\n281\n00:18:23.947 --> 00:18:27.514\nour client, so\nlet's switch over to PLAB WIN 801.\n\n282\n00:18:27.514 --> 00:18:29.310\nThis is going to be our client.\n\n283\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.420\nAnd, oops, did I already run an IP config?\n\n284\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.780\nI sure did.\n\n285\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.130\nAnd you can see, here,\non our Ethernet adapter number 2,\n\n286\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.350\nactually, you can look at both of them and\nit shows a good comparison here.\n\n287\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:44.110\nBecause if you look at just Ethernet,\nregular Ethernet,\n\n288\n00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:49.850\nyou can see both the IPv6 version of\nthat address as well as an IP version 4.\n\n289\n00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:55.040\nNow that FE80, if you recall when we were\ntalking about the difference between IP\n\n290\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:02.160\nversion 4 and 6, FE80 is going to be\ncomparable to an IPv4 APIPA address.\n\n291\n00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.910\nSo that's going to be\nour link local address.\n\n292\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.390\nAnd remember, with IP version 6,\nwe always maintain that link local.\n\n293\n00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:13.470\nIt's not just given to us as a crutch,\nokay?\n\n294\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.440\nBut if we jump down to Ethernet II,\nand remember,\n\n295\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.200\nthat's the adapter that I've modified.\n\n296\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.924\nThat's what we're really\nworking with here.\n\n297\n00:19:20.924 --> 00:19:24.244\nNotice there is no IP version 4, okay?\n\n298\n00:19:24.244 --> 00:19:28.880\nSo I've disabled IP version 4\non our Windows 8 client here.\n\n299\n00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.970\nWe'll just see that link\nlocal address right here.\n\n300\n00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.980\nOkay, so now that we've established that,\n\n301\n00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.160\nwhat we really need to do is to go\nahead and configure that ISATAP router.\n\n302\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:46.600\nRemember, PLABSA01 is going to be\nour in-house machine for that.\n\n303\n00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.840\nSo what I'm gonna do is actually\nrun reg edit to go ahead and\n\n304\n00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.260\nlaunch my registry editor.\n\n305\n00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.556\nI don't know, let's see, can you see that\nor should I zoom in a little bit there,\n\n306\n00:19:58.556 --> 00:20:00.064\nmake it a little bit larger.\n\n307\n00:20:00.064 --> 00:20:02.790\nWe're gonna be drilling down quite a bit,\nso\n\n308\n00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.543\nyou may need to refer back to\nthe show notes or just hit rewind.\n\n309\n00:20:06.543 --> 00:20:11.431\nBecause the interface sometimes\nyou have to just make sure\n\n310\n00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:16.331\nyou can see everything and\nit can get a little fuzzy there.\n\n311\n00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:19.539\nSo what we're gonna do is look\nunder our HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,\n\n312\n00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:21.009\ngo ahead and expand that out.\n\n313\n00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:25.310\nAnd we're gonna be drilling down\ninside of our systems setting.\n\n314\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:30.090\nAnd then from there gonna continue\nto go to our current control set.\n\n315\n00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.907\nAnd just by clicking on this little\ntriangle and expanding it out,\n\n316\n00:20:33.907 --> 00:20:37.793\nyou might already be familiar with\nthe way that that'll go ahead and\n\n317\n00:20:37.793 --> 00:20:40.675\ncreate that directory or\nexpand that tree there.\n\n318\n00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:46.930\nNext, we're gonna go ahead and expand out\nservices and then scroll down to TCP/IP.\n\n319\n00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.251\nKeep scrolling, it'll be a little bit.\n\n320\n00:20:53.495 --> 00:20:59.650\nI can remember my alphabet, u, r, s,\nI think t comes next, there we go.\n\n321\n00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.252\nAnd so we have TCP/IP,\n\n322\n00:21:01.252 --> 00:21:06.160\nand what I'm gonna be looking at\nnext is going to be parameters.\n\n323\n00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.784\nSo I can go ahead and expand that out.\n\n324\n00:21:07.784 --> 00:21:10.698\nBut since I'm gonna be\nworking with my perimeters,\n\n325\n00:21:10.698 --> 00:21:13.172\nI really wanna click\non the lettering here.\n\n326\n00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:16.870\nSo left-click on top of the letters and\nthen on the right-hand side,\n\n327\n00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.570\nyou'll see those values\nthat can be modified.\n\n328\n00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:26.040\nNow the value that I'm looking to modify\nhere is going to be my IP Enable Router.\n\n329\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.723\nSo just left-click and highlight it,\nthen right click and select Modify.\n\n330\n00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:35.989\nNotice that currently my\nvalue is set to zero.\n\n331\n00:21:35.989 --> 00:21:38.918\nAnd if you think like binary, on and off,\n\n332\n00:21:38.918 --> 00:21:42.826\ncurrently this particular\nfunction is set to be off.\n\n333\n00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:46.750\nSo what we're gonna do is change that to\na one here, and then we will go ahead and\n\n334\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.790\nset OK.\n\n335\n00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.200\nBecause if you look at that value,\nIP enable router, so\n\n336\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.770\nwe're basically giving the green light for\nthis machine to become a router here.\n\n337\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.799\nWe'll hit OK, all right?\n\n338\n00:21:58.799 --> 00:21:59.960\nWe can just close out of here.\n\n339\n00:22:05.122 --> 00:22:07.960\nWe'll get my size back to normal there,\nall right?\n\n340\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.700\nThe next thing I wanna go ahead and do is\nrestart this machine, so let's see here.\n\n341\n00:22:21.344 --> 00:22:22.550\nI'm jumping around a bit,\nsorry about that.\n\n342\n00:22:32.352 --> 00:22:34.148\nAnd we'll go ahead and give that a second.\n\n343\n00:22:34.148 --> 00:22:37.829\nI know we're getting close to time for\nthis particular show, so\n\n344\n00:22:37.829 --> 00:22:40.360\nwhy don't we go ahead and\npause right here?\n\n345\n00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.170\nWe'll pick back, and\n\n346\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.740\nlet the machine restart, we'll pick\nback up right here on this machine.\n\n347\n00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:47.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, well again,\n\n348\n00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.530\nthank you for helping us out up until this\npoint and thank you also for joining us.\n\n349\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.310\nYou've seen a lot of the different\ntransitional technologies that you're\n\n350\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.150\ngonna be encountering on,\nof course the 70-410 exam,\n\n351\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:04.040\nas well as in real business as people are\nstarting to transition from IPv4 to IPv6.\n\n352\n00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.310\nSo, of course, that means you\nwanna come back and see the lab,\n\n353\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.270\nespecially on Isotap that Cherokee's\ngonna be walking us through, as well.\n\n354\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.330\nBut this is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n355\n00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.490\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n356\n00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.521\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n357\n00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:24.255\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more of\nthe

00:00:37.870\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, so in the last\nshow we were setting up our ISATAP\n\n13\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.244\nrouter on SAPLABSAL01, and\nwe were waiting for that reboot.\n\n14\n00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:46.700\nSo if you haven't watched that previous\nshow, then I would encourage you to do so.\n\n15\n00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.260\nSo you just don't feel like\nkind of left out here.\n\n16\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.750\nNow, what I did was showed you\nhow to modify the registry there.\n\n17\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.093\nThere are more ways than just this\nparticular way to go head and\n\n18\n00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:00.066\nconfigure that.\n\n19\n00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.326\nYou might have a better way.\n\n20\n00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:05.951\nI don't know, but just note that there\nare other ways to go ahead and do that,\n\n21\n00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:09.885\nand I have included some other options for\nyou in this show notes.\n\n22\n00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:14.835\nYou really wanna even pay attention to\nthat section where I note the PowerShell\n\n23\n00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:19.710\ncommand lines there, because you know\nhow Microsoft loves PowerShell, but\n\n24\n00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.090\nhere we'll take a look at\nan older tool called Netsh.\n\n25\n00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.040\nBut I just wanna verify that what we did\nin that last show actually worked, so\n\n26\n00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.130\nlet's take a look at my screen and\ncheck that.\n\n27\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.590\nSo what we're gonna just run\nis ipconfig /all here, and\n\n28\n00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.870\nwhat we're looking for\nis going to up here towards the top.\n\n29\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.110\nLook for IP Routing Enabled.\n\n30\n00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.010\nRemember, that's what we actually changed\nthat binary value for to allow that.\n\n31\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.260\nAnd we can see here, yes, we are allowed\nto use this machine now as a router.\n\n32\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.774\nSo what we wanna do is,\nnow that we've configured that,\n\n33\n00:01:56.774 --> 00:02:02.864\nif you think about how IPv6 works and\nthe routing capabilities that it supports,\n\n34\n00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:06.418\nwe need to go ahead and\nestablish our actual RA.\n\n35\n00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.799\nOkay, we need to go ahead and\n\n36\n00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.680\nset our router advertisement for\nour global address.\n\n37\n00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.770\nSo we're gonna do that here on PLABSA01.\n\n38\n00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.650\nLet me just clear my screen, and\nthe first thing I wanna do is go ahead and\n\n39\n00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.990\nlaunch PowerShell, if you haven't already,\nas an administrative user.\n\n40\n00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.280\nAnd I'm gonna use netsh here.\n\n41\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.330\nSo I'm gonna type in netsh interface.\n\n42\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.733\nAnd here, remember,\nwe're gonna be using IP version 6.\n\n43\n00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:44.014\nAnd this is going to be,\nset interface, and\n\n44\n00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:50.517\nthe ethernet adapter that we're\nusing is going to be Ethernet 2.\n\n45\n00:02:50.517 --> 00:02:54.870\nAnd we're using quotes here just\nbecause we do have that space.\n\n46\n00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.700\nWe'll set forwarding =enabled.\n\n47\n00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.630\nAnd that's going to be.\n\n48\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.060\nAlso, we need to set our\nadvertisement as well.\n\n49\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.060\nSo we'll say advertise =enabled,\nAnd we'll hit enter.\n\n50\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.620\nWe don't get a lot of notification here,\nbut\n\n51\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.660\nwe do see OK, and\nlike I said, alternatively,\n\n52\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.530\nyou could use different cmdlets here\nto go ahead and set that as well.\n\n53\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.450\nThe next thing we need to do is go ahead,\nand\n\n54\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.790\nwe need to assign a global address here.\n\n55\n00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.030\nSo let's, again, use netsh.\n\n56\n00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.883\nWe're gonna, again, type in interface.\n\n57\n00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:44.074\nThis is going to be IPv6,\nand we'll hit add route.\n\n58\n00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:45.460\nGo ahead and set this route.\n\n59\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.974\nAnd the address that we're gonna\nuse is going to be 2001:db8.\n\n60\n00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:57.710\nNow, Ronnie,\nwe were talking about this earlier today.\n\n61\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.101\nThis address guys,\nif you ever notice this db8,\n\n62\n00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:05.130\nthis is going to be used for\ndocumentation purposes.\n\n63\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.065\nSo in a lot of textbooks and\nblogs online and so forth,\n\n64\n00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:10.543\nand in my notes you'll\nsee that being noted,\n\n65\n00:04:10.543 --> 00:04:15.068\nbecause this is a demonstration here,\nso that’s why we’re using that address.\n\n66\n00:04:15.068 --> 00:04:17.598\nAll right, and\njust making sure my syntax right here,\n\n67\n00:04:17.598 --> 00:04:19.806\nyou know you got to love\nthese IPv6 addresses.\n\n68\n00:04:19.806 --> 00:04:24.594\n[LAUGH] 0:1, and then that’s\n\n69\n00:04:24.594 --> 00:04:29.220\ngoing to be ::/ with a 64.\n\n70\n00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.744\nAll right, and again,\nwe’ll specify our Ethernet 2.\n\n71\n00:04:35.744 --> 00:04:38.140\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and hit publish.\n\n72\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.120\nAnd I think that is an equals, yes.\n\n73\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.266\nEquals, yes.\n\n74\n00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:46.490\nI didn't mean to say that.\n\n75\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.520\nWe'll hit enter, and\nwe'll see that that was okay, as well.\n\n76\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.590\nAll right Cherokee, you've just shown us\na lot of stuff, but just up in this point,\n\n77\n00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.200\njust kind of review just a little\nbit up in this point, and\n\n78\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.710\nthat will help us to prepare for\nwhat comes next.\n\n79\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo what we just did,\n\n80\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.910\nwe used Netsh to go ahead and\nconfigure our global address.\n\n81\n00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.110\nSome technologies will require you to\ngo ahead and do of all this manual.\n\n82\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.180\nAnd you can configure static IP\naddresses there, but here with ISATAP,\n\n83\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.720\nit does, it utilizes it, it leverages off\nof slack or stateless technology there.\n\n84\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.300\nSo it's more automatic, so we just\nuse Netsh to go ahead and set that.\n\n85\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.760\nBut we're not quite finished here,\nbecause we need to hop on over to our\n\n86\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.310\ndomain controller to go ahead and\nprovide a quad A record to\n\n87\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.970\nindicate that this machine now is\ngoing to be our isotopic router.\n\n88\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.860\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n89\n00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.756\nIf I switch on over to\nour domain controller.\n\n90\n00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.258\nOops, we are not connected.\n\n91\n00:05:48.258 --> 00:05:52.800\nHere let me get that machine connected.\n\n92\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.000\nThat's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n93\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.730\nThis machine, my domain controller,\nand this lab is actually running,\n\n94\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.402\nfacilitating as my DNS server.\n\n95\n00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:03.459\nSo, I'll go ahead and\nmodify that record here.\n\n96\n00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:09.103\nIt's connecting.\n\n97\n00:06:09.103 --> 00:06:10.890\nJust give it a second here.\n\n98\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.130\nAll right.\nThere we go.\n\n99\n00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.820\nSo under Server Manager, go ahead and\npull up your DNS Management Console.\n\n100\n00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.680\nAnd let me full screen that, so\nyou can see what we're doing.\n\n101\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.687\nFrom the left-hand side,\n\n102\n00:06:21.687 --> 00:06:28.500\nlet's expand out our PLABDC01 over here\non the left, just click that arrow.\n\n103\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.290\nAnd what we're going to be looking for\nis our forward lookup zone.\n\n104\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.990\nSo go ahead and expand that out as well.\n\n105\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.470\nAnd, again,\nto our practicelabs.com over here.\n\n106\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.432\nYou can expand it out, but\nI just wanted to show you, here,\n\n107\n00:06:43.432 --> 00:06:48.746\nin the center pane that currently we don't\nhave any ISATAP router configured or\n\n108\n00:06:48.746 --> 00:06:52.819\nany kind of record that indicates\nthere is an ISATAP router.\n\n109\n00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.469\nSo back over here on the left-hand side,\n\n110\n00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:59.635\nwhat we'll do is right-click on\ntop of practicelabs.com, and\n\n111\n00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:03.970\nthen select new host A or quad A,\nand we'll go ahead and set that up.\n\n112\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.840\nSo for this portion right here,\nthe part where we indicate a name,\n\n113\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.819\nlet's go ahead and type in ISATAP.\n\n114\n00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.008\nAnd the IP address that we're gonna be\nusing is going to be the IP address\n\n115\n00:07:17.008 --> 00:07:21.496\nthat we just configured for\nthe other machine for PLABSA01.\n\n116\n00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:26.387\nSo that's going to be 192.168.0.40 here.\n\n117\n00:07:26.387 --> 00:07:28.340\nAnd we'll go ahead and add this host.\n\n118\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.680\nNow you can see that we've successfully\nwent ahead and created that host.\n\n119\n00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.530\nGo ahead and hit OK.\n\n120\n00:07:38.327 --> 00:07:42.643\nAll right, now that we've added our\nquad A record there, or our excuse me,\n\n121\n00:07:42.643 --> 00:07:47.364\nA record, or our ISATAP router, you can\nsee that noted there, let's hop back over\n\n122\n00:07:47.364 --> 00:07:51.810\nto our router so we can do some\nadditional configurations here.\n\n123\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.720\nAgain, we're gonna be leveraging Netsh.\n\n124\n00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.918\nBut this time we're gonna be\nconfiguring the router, so\n\n125\n00:07:57.918 --> 00:08:00.897\nwe'll say interface, if I'm typing.\n\n126\n00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:01.547\nOkay, there we go.\n\n127\n00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:06.802\nnetsh interface, and for the rest of this,\n\n128\n00:08:06.802 --> 00:08:10.644\nit's going to be IP version 6.\n\n129\n00:08:10.644 --> 00:08:17.839\nWe're gonna type in ISATAP, I-S-A-T-A-P,\nmake sure I'm writing that correctly.\n\n130\n00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:25.068\nWe're gonna say, set router, and\nthen specify the IP address for\n\n131\n00:08:25.068 --> 00:08:29.726\nthis router, 192.168.0.4.\n\n132\n00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:31.420\nAnd then we'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n133\n00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.502\nNow, we need to take some\ninformation that's going to be\n\n134\n00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:42.141\nidentifying our ISATAP router,\nso we're gonna run ipconfig.\n\n135\n00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:47.348\nAnd I wanna show you how\nwe can use our Notepad here\n\n136\n00:08:47.348 --> 00:08:52.320\nto help with this ISATAP\ntunnel information.\n\n137\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.930\nSo if we go ahead and take a look,\nwhat we're gonna do is highlight and\n\n138\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.150\njust mark this up from left to right here.\n\n139\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.340\nAnd then, so once we get it highlighted,\nup in the top, well, really anywhere.\n\n140\n00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.573\nIt's kind of funny, Ronnie,\nI always for some reason thought\n\n141\n00:09:06.573 --> 00:09:10.416\nyou had to click on the little PowerShell\nlogo to get the menu pulled up, but\n\n142\n00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:13.349\nreally you can click anywhere\non the bar and pull that up.\n\n143\n00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:19.066\nSo here we're just gonna hit Edit and\nCopy, and let's launch Notepad here.\n\n144\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:23.982\nAnd then we'll paste that.\n\n145\n00:09:27.023 --> 00:09:30.565\nOkay, I'm just gonna leave this here\nin Notepad, in case, for some reason,\n\n146\n00:09:30.565 --> 00:09:34.230\nI accidentally close PowerShell or\nsomething, we don't have to do that again.\n\n147\n00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.235\nIt should have it in cache, but\nI'm going to leverage the copy and\n\n148\n00:09:39.235 --> 00:09:42.648\npaste function here,\nbecause that is a lot to type out.\n\n149\n00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:48.937\nSo what we're going to do is type netsh,\nand we're going to specify interface,\n\n150\n00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:53.690\nif I'm spelling correctly,\nyes, interface ipv6.\n\n151\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.714\nAnd let's set interface.\n\n152\n00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:02.605\nNow, this is where I can put in a quote,\nand\n\n153\n00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:07.828\nthen go up to the top here,\nright-click, and then select Edit and\n\n154\n00:10:07.828 --> 00:10:12.423\nPaste, to go ahead and\npaste that information in, okay?\n\n155\n00:10:12.423 --> 00:10:13.490\nAnd it didn't go in.\n\n156\n00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.554\nSo what I'm gonna do is pull\nthat here from my Notepad.\n\n157\n00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:18.960\nGood thing we did that, right?\n\n158\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.312\nCopy that, and then we'll paste it in.\n\n159\n00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:28.111\nOkay.\n\n160\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.680\nSpecify here with your end quote.\n\n161\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.940\nAnd then, after that, we'll go ahead and\nset forwarding, and we'll enable it.\n\n162\n00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.660\nSo F-A-R, F-O-R-W-A-R-D-I-N-G.\n\n163\n00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.393\nforwarding=enabled.\n\n164\n00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:47.221\nAnd then, also,\nwe'll need to advertise that, so\n\n165\n00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:50.441\nwe'll say advertise=enabled, as well.\n\n166\n00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:54.130\nDid I spell that correctly?\n\n167\n00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.340\nOkay, we'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n168\n00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.750\nLooks like I added an extra s there.\n\n169\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.900\nSo we'll just hit our up arrow.\n\n170\n00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.530\nLet me back up and remove that.\n\n171\n00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.950\nI think that's my error.\n\n172\n00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.667\nLet's find out.\n\n173\n00:11:09.705 --> 00:11:11.211\nYep, that appears to be the error.\n\n174\n00:11:11.211 --> 00:11:15.270\n[LAUGH] So we'll go ahead, and\nonce we have that set here,\n\n175\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.770\nwe also need to specify the address\nthat we were using earlier.\n\n176\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.302\nSo again,\nwe'll be using the Netsh command.\n\n177\n00:11:22.302 --> 00:11:30.959\nSo we have netsh interface ipv6.\n\n178\n00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:35.108\nHere we're going to add route, and\n\n179\n00:11:35.108 --> 00:11:42.170\nwe'll specify our global address here,\n2001:db8.\n\n180\n00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.497\nIt's going to be a :0:\n\n181\n00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:56.399\n;1, and then another 0, and then ::/64.\n\n182\n00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:06.640\nAgain, let's paste our\nactual adapter information.\n\n183\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.160\nSo you can see that just\nwent in right there.\n\n184\n00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.388\nAnd again,\nwe'll end that with a end quote here.\n\n185\n00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:16.557\nLet me make sure my cursor\ndidn't lock up on me.\n\n186\n00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:19.601\nLooks like that's what happened.\n\n187\n00:12:22.248 --> 00:12:23.996\nOkay, there we go.\n\n188\n00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:31.661\nAnd we'll set this to be published,\nso publish=yes.\n\n189\n00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:33.510\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n190\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.381\nAnd we see OK.\n\n191\n00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:37.150\nSo what we're gonna do is, we're going\nto go ahead and restart this machine.\n\n192\n00:12:44.376 --> 00:12:49.692\nWhile that machine is restarting,\nwhat we can do is switch back over\n\n193\n00:12:49.692 --> 00:12:55.213\nto our PLABDM01, and we can configure\na little bit there, as well.\n\n194\n00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:56.660\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n195\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.304\nOkay, so while that's rebooting,\nwe're here on PLABDM01.\n\n196\n00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:07.320\nLet's just go ahead, and again use\nnetsh to specify that ISATAP router.\n\n197\n00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:13.852\nSo we'll say interface, I-N-T-E-R-F-A-C-E,\n\n198\n00:13:13.852 --> 00:13:19.050\nisatap, set router, and then we'll specify\n\n199\n00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:24.125\nthe IP address, 192.168.0.4.\n\n200\n00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:26.885\nAnd then we'll hit Enter.\n\n201\n00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:30.031\nOops, am I typing crazily?\n\n202\n00:13:31.057 --> 00:13:33.131\n&gt;&gt; ISATAP.\n\n203\n00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:33.742\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n204\n00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:52.632\nThis is going to be isatap set router.\n\n205\n00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:57.790\n192.168.0.4, Enter, okay.\n\n206\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.400\nNow, the next step that we need to do is,\nwell let's go ahead and\n\n207\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.680\nwe need to think about that topology that\nwe looked at at the beginning where we had\n\n208\n00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.610\nthose firewalls in place.\n\n209\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.130\nSo from here if we just type in wf.msc,\n\n210\n00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:15.515\nthis is going to launch\nour Windows fires off up.\n\n211\n00:14:15.515 --> 00:14:16.123\n&gt;&gt; Firewall?\n\n212\n00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:16.800\n&gt;&gt; Windows firewall.\n\n213\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.280\nI was thinking Microsoft for\nour configuration there.\n\n214\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.310\nSo this will go ahead and\npull up our firewall.\n\n215\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.790\nWhat we're gonnabe looking at is\nallowing those inbound connections.\n\n216\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.160\nSo let's go ahead, and it may or\nmay not already be configured, but\n\n217\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.220\nI just wanna verify.\n\n218\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.567\nOtherwise, it's not going\nto be able to communicate.\n\n219\n00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:39.923\nSo let's check our file and\nprinter sharing for that.\n\n220\n00:14:39.923 --> 00:14:45.680\nAnd let's see here, because that's\ngoing to be allowing that traffic.\n\n221\n00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.630\nSo here we have for\na echo request, ICMP version 4,\n\n222\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.210\nfor our inbound, and currently,\nwe can see that it is enabled, so\n\n223\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.670\nwe're good to go there, we don't have to\ndo anything, I just wanted to verify that.\n\n224\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.004\nAnd the last thing we need to do here,\nis actually try to ping our machines and\n\n225\n00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:06.870\nverify that that connectivity\nactually exists.\n\n226\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:12.490\nSo from our Windows 8 machine,\nlet's hop on over to our client here.\n\n227\n00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:17.180\nSo remember,\nthis is our IPv6 only machine, our client.\n\n228\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:23.000\nWhat we wanna do is ping PLABDM01.\n\n229\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.636\nSo let's try that.\n\n230\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.077\nIf I'm typing, there we go.\n\n231\n00:15:29.077 --> 00:15:35.127\nPing, PLABDM01.\n\n232\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:43.722\nNow, we were able to obtain a reply\nfrom a machine that, well, we might\n\n233\n00:15:43.722 --> 00:15:49.391\nnot normally expect to get a reply from,\nbecause if this is an IPv6 machine,\n\n234\n00:15:49.391 --> 00:15:54.740\nand we're trying to ping an IPv4 client,\nwell, how does that happen?\n\n235\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.747\nWell, we just configured\nthat ISATAP router that's\n\n236\n00:15:58.747 --> 00:16:01.784\nallowing this reply to actually occur.\n\n237\n00:16:01.784 --> 00:16:04.916\nSo, the other way we could go ahead and\ntest this,\n\n238\n00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:08.056\nis if we wanted to ping\nfrom the actual IP address.\n\n239\n00:16:08.056 --> 00:16:12.356\nSo if we say ping, 192.168.0.2,\n\n240\n00:16:12.356 --> 00:16:20.500\nwe can see that we're actually getting\nan IP version 4 reply this time, as well.\n\n241\n00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.860\nSo this is one way that you could\nactually configure an ISATAP router.\n\n242\n00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.370\nAgain, you might wanna take a look at\nthe notes, just to see other alternatives.\n\n243\n00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.170\nDon't underestimate those\nPowerShell cmdlets,\n\n244\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.790\nand I think that's about it Ronnie.\n\n245\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n246\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.160\nThank you for\n\n247\n00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.645\nshowing us that demonstration here\nof how to setup the ISATAP router.\n\n248\n00:16:39.645 --> 00:16:43.970\nRemember at the end, when we actually did\nverify everything, Cherokee did show going\n\n249\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.590\nfrom an IP version 6 only client that\nwe could also, of course, hit somebody\n\n250\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.980\nelse running IP version 6, which is\nsomething we expect to be able to do.\n\n251\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.023\nSince that one machine is running\nboth IP version 4 and IP version 6,\n\n252\n00:16:57.023 --> 00:16:59.810\nwe got the IP version 6 responding back.\n\n253\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.980\nBut then when Cherokee went ahead and\npinged the IP address,\n\n254\n00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:08.240\nwhich was an IP version 4 address,\nfrom a machine running only IP version 6,\n\n255\n00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.510\nshe was still able to get a reply.\n\n256\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.700\nAnd that demonstrates how ISATAP\ndid function and did work for us.\n\n257\n00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.450\nSo remember that even though\nthis configuration is there,\n\n258\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.130\nyou wanna make sure you pay attention to\nthe commands that she ended up using.\n\n259\n00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.220\nAnd also, take a look at maybe the idea\nhere of even running it in PowerShell as\n\n260\n00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.480\nwell, cuz that may also be viable for\nyou when you get ready for the exam.\n\n261\n00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.980\nSo thank you, Cherokee,\nfor helping us there.\n\n262\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.900\nAnd thank you also for joining us,\nbut this a great place for\n\n263\n00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.660\nus to end this episode then.\n\n264\n00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.277\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n265\n00:17:39.277 -->

another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:17.410\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.434\nAnd today, we're doing our\nMCSA Window Server 2012 in preparation for\n\n9\n00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:24.760\nthat 70-410 exam.\n\n10\n00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.843\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n11\n00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:30.694\nwe're gonna be taking a look at ways\nwe can configure IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n12\n00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:33.890\nHere to show us how to do all\nthe fun stuff is Ms. Cherokee Boose.\n\n13\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.920\nWelcome back Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.730\n&gt;&gt; How's it going today Mike?\n\n15\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.210\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, thanks.\n\n16\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.260\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, I'm really\nexcited to be here today because you know\n\n17\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.550\nthis topic is one that you may have or\nhave not already been introduced to.\n\n18\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.540\nIt's important to us here in Server\nbecause we need to understand it at\n\n19\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.110\na fundamental level before we can\nactually implement it and configure it.\n\n20\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.370\nThat's not really the hard part.\n\n21\n00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.830\nJust understanding why we're typing\ncertain numbers in is the hard part.\n\n22\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.701\nSo, you may have seen this if you've taken\nany kind of prior training usually like\n\n23\n00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:06.760\nNet Plus is a great place to start.\n\n24\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.847\nIf this is brand new to you and you have\nno clue to what we're talking about here,\n\n25\n00:01:10.847 --> 00:01:13.105\nthen definitely go back and\ncheck that out.\n\n26\n00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:16.832\nBecause there's a lot of ground\nlevel type information that's\n\n27\n00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:18.357\nshared in those classes.\n\n28\n00:01:18.357 --> 00:01:22.847\nI know I have done specific\nshows on some of these topics,\n\n29\n00:01:22.847 --> 00:01:27.268\neven in the Server 101 and\nwe have seen a lot of those.\n\n30\n00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:31.140\n&gt;&gt; They get covered in a lot of\ndifferent classes, it is one of those\n\n31\n00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.300\nfundamental skills that we have to have,\nwhether you are a help desk technician,\n\n32\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.910\na administrator for\na small network or a global network.\n\n33\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.930\nIt is a very important skill\nto have because we know that\n\n34\n00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.840\nIP addresses that what we use to\ncommunicate back and forth across network.\n\n35\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.390\nSo obviously, a very important part\nof maintaining our environment.\n\n36\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.009\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and if we look at\nthe actual historical aspect of it and\n\n37\n00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.964\nI have this on my screen here,\n\n38\n00:01:56.964 --> 00:02:00.823\nthis is just a very basic\na simple diagram here of ARPANET.\n\n39\n00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:05.826\nAnd if we back in time here to\nlike circa 1970 we can see that\n\n40\n00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:12.030\neven here at UCLA where that first\ntransmission was actually sent from.\n\n41\n00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.630\nAt this point and time we just\nhave a handful of nodes, right?\n\n42\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.850\nSo, there's not a whole lot of\nconfusion at this point and time.\n\n43\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.480\nThere wasn't a ton of different protocols.\n\n44\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.940\nAnd especially security wasn't that big of\nan issue because they trusted each other,\n\n45\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.550\nand they knew each other so\nit wasn't a big deal.\n\n46\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.710\n&gt;&gt; They didn't have to worry about the\nhackers from another country coming in or\n\n47\n00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.730\nanything like that, right?\n\n48\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, it was just centralized\nhere to North America.\n\n49\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.112\nAnd you think about the people involved\nlike Vint Cerf and you've got Mr.\n\n50\n00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:41.865\nLickliter.\n\n51\n00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:47.270\nAnd there are several more here, Claude\nShannon, Elizabeth aka Jake Feinler.\n\n52\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.800\nAnd a lot of those people,\nit was hard for them,\n\n53\n00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.600\nI don't think they really anticipated\nthe Internet taking off the way it did.\n\n54\n00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.830\nSo you can see here with\nour IPv4 addressing scheme,\n\n55\n00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.880\nwe had approximately this 4 million 294\nsome odd addresses available to us.\n\n56\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.237\nAnd comparing that to IPv6 that\nwe're gonna transition into,\n\n57\n00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:17.924\nwhat is it 340 undecillion.\n\n58\n00:03:17.924 --> 00:03:19.737\n&gt;&gt; Undecillion, yes.\n\n59\n00:03:19.737 --> 00:03:25.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, I mean when you do\nthe comparison is absolutely outstanding.\n\n60\n00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.726\nAnd if you think about, look at the IPv4,\nright now we have approximately\n\n61\n00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:34.180\n7.5 billion humans\ninhabiting planet Earth.\n\n62\n00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.870\nSo, Mike, how many devices do you\nhave that require IP addresses?\n\n63\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.540\n&gt;&gt; Gosh, if we start listing here,\nyou think about your phone, your tablet,\n\n64\n00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.090\nyour laptop, a couple computers,\nyour DVR, your ROKU, the list goes on.\n\n65\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.140\nI could probably come up with\nat least ten in my house.\n\n66\n00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.150\nSo, you know, average-\n&gt;&gt; So exponentially,\n\n67\n00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.440\nwe have got a situation.\n\n68\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.380\n&gt;&gt; I want to say Cisco said somewhere\naround an average of five or\n\n69\n00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.955\nsix devices per users is what they use\nto calculate some of their numbers,\n\n70\n00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:03.065\nsomething like that.\n\n71\n00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:05.350\nIt's crazy, it's really is.\n\n72\n00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.200\nBut when you look at those\nnumbers Cherokee, you said,\n\n73\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.711\nthere was a what 4 billion 200 or\nsome odd million IPv4 addresses possible.\n\n74\n00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:16.849\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I might have said\nmillion, but that's what I meant there.\n\n75\n00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.441\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then there is 340 undecillion\n\n76\n00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:21.359\nIPv6s.\n\n77\n00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.670\nThat's a huge jump.\n\n78\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.944\n&gt;&gt; A huge jump.\n\n79\n00:04:24.944 --> 00:04:29.716\nMike when I first started working in IT,\nI was told hey you guys have to get\n\n80\n00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:34.254\nprepared for IPv6, it's a transition\nthat we're about to have and\n\n81\n00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:38.210\nover a decade later,\nmost networks are still using IPv4.\n\n82\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.210\nI think the main driving source behind\nthat is just the expense associated with\n\n83\n00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.530\na lot of the equipment.\n\n84\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:51.779\nAlso a lot of intimidation\nassociated with IPv6.\n\n85\n00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.030\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, once you get into IPv6,\nyou realize how easy is it to manage.\n\n86\n00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.800\nIt is a big number and so, it's a lot of\ntyping, it's easy to transpose numbers and\n\n87\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.340\nthings like that.\n\n88\n00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.850\nBut it's so automated that we really don't\nhave to do a lot of that that often.\n\n89\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.430\nBut you are right,\nyou're seeing it's a slow transition.\n\n90\n00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.075\nAnd any time we make a major change like\nthis it's gonna take a little while.\n\n91\n00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:15.180\nBecause first you've\ngotta get the companies\n\n92\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.180\nare operating systems that fully\nsupport IPv6, it's built into them.\n\n93\n00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.785\nBut that doesn't mean those old\nrouters that we have support IPv6.\n\n94\n00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:26.286\nNow I've gotta upgrade all that\nhardware and that's an expense and\n\n95\n00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:27.700\nwhat's my benefit?\n\n96\n00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.010\nSometimes seeing the cost benefit\nthere is difficult for organizations.\n\n97\n00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.960\nAnd then you think about\nthe backbones of the Internet.\n\n98\n00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.270\nAll those-\n&gt;&gt; Really expensive equipment that we're\n\n99\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.547\ndealing with there,\na lot of high end equipment.\n\n100\n00:05:37.547 --> 00:05:41.451\n&gt;&gt; Yes and a lot of this is non for profit\nit's not like there's organizations that\n\n101\n00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:43.850\nare making money off\nmaintaining these things.\n\n102\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.438\nSo it's going to take time before\nwe see it fully implemented.\n\n103\n00:05:49.438 --> 00:05:53.470\nBut I know here we live in Florida,\nI live in Florida and\n\n104\n00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.115\nCox Communication is using IPv6.\n\n105\n00:05:56.115 --> 00:05:58.975\nI mean we're still using IPv4 but-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of companies, ISPs,\n\n106\n00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:02.260\nare supporting that, but\nyou will see that not everyone is.\n\n107\n00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.220\nSo something to just be aware of.\n\n108\n00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.910\nAnd we are gonna eventually,\n\n109\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.380\nI know there's a lot to talk\nabout here in this topic.\n\n110\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.470\nBut eventually, we'll get to look at\nsome of those transition technologies\n\n111\n00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.779\nto help us make that, well, transition.\n\n112\n00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.755\n[LAUGH] So anyway,\na lot of the configurations and\n\n113\n00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:26.875\nthe features associated with\nIPv4 were afterthoughts.\n\n114\n00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:30.975\nAnd then if we look at that in\ncomparison to IPv6, a lot of them were\n\n115\n00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:35.602\nbuilt right into that and they actually\nwere able to plan ahead a little bit more.\n\n116\n00:06:35.602 --> 00:06:39.182\nThey saw how that growth\nhappened there with the Internet.\n\n117\n00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:41.732\nAnd so you'll see as we continue.\n\n118\n00:06:41.732 --> 00:06:48.812\nBut I think looking and just recapping\nhere for IPv4 is a great place to start.\n\n119\n00:06:48.812 --> 00:06:52.392\nBecause we're not gonna go fully in-depth,\nbut\n\n120\n00:06:52.392 --> 00:06:57.570\nI will highlight on the must,\nthe need to know essentials here.\n\n121\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.660\nBecause when it comes to this\nparticular exam, if you're studying for\n\n122\n00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.730\nthe 70-410, Microsoft assumes that you\nalready have this knowledge down pat.\n\n123\n00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.490\nSo, they're not specifically gonna\nbe asking you questions like,\n\n124\n00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.960\nwhat's the range for a class A address?\n\n125\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.270\nBut, you may see that integrated\ninto certain questions or scenarios.\n\n126\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.120\nSo I'm recapping on this because you\ncan't really configure things if\n\n127\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.690\ndon't why you're configuring them\nessentially like we already said.\n\n128\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.749\nSo if we take a look here and\nwe think about our classes and\n\n129\n00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:34.097\ndown here I have them all listed out.\n\n130\n00:07:34.097 --> 00:07:38.902\nI kind of omitted D and\nE from some of these other examples\n\n131\n00:07:38.902 --> 00:07:43.810\nhere because we really don't\nuse them that often there,\n\n132\n00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.532\nbut we do see Class A, B and\nC, being used quite often.\n\n133\n00:07:48.532 --> 00:07:53.480\nIt's kind of interesting how restricted\nwe are with these particular class full\n\n134\n00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.870\naddress ranges here.\n\n135\n00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.045\nBecause, if you look at a Class A And\nI just wrote them\n\n136\n00:07:58.045 --> 00:08:02.897\nin numerous ways here to kind of get you\nthinking like a computer in that binary.\n\n137\n00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:07.339\nBecause as we continue to look even\nwith IPv6, sometimes I think it helps\n\n138\n00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:11.652\ncomparing, even though we're dealing\nwith apples and oranges here.\n\n139\n00:08:11.652 --> 00:08:15.891\nBut looking at it at that binary level can\nsometimes create that association there.\n\n140\n00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:21.265\nSo I tried to color code it too here,\nbut with a Class A, all right?\n\n141\n00:08:21.265 --> 00:08:24.940\n255.0.0.0 subnet mask.\n\n142\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.750\nFor my network portion,\nI can have 128 networks.\n\n143\n00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.461\nAnd then I can have 16,777,214 hosts.\n\n144\n00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:38.426\nAnd so I tried to color code\nthe zeros representing our host\n\n145\n00:08:38.426 --> 00:08:42.488\nportion of the IP address,\nthe blue ones here.\n\n146\n00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:48.123\nSo ones are gonna be representing\nthe network portion of our subnet masks or\n\n147\n00:08:48.123 --> 00:08:54.660\nthe IP addresses combined with that subnet\nmasks to identify that particular device.\n\n148\n00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.170\nAnd you can think about it.\n\n149\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.780\nOne great analogy that I like to use is\n\n150\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.540\nthe network portion is kind of\nlike that street address and\n\n151\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.350\nthen the host portion over here on\nthe right is like the house number.\n\n152\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.820\nSo all of your neighbors on that\nstreet share that same street address\n\n153\n00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.410\njust as if your neighbors on your\nsubnet would share that same\n\n154\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.810\nnetwork portion here of this address.\n\n155\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.360\nSo you can see it written in a few\ndifferent ways, like I said, here.\n\n156\n00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.780\nWritten in decimal showing those classes,\nwritten in binary here.\n\n157\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.700\nAnd then also a very common way\nyou may even see on the exam would\n\n158\n00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.980\nbe in that slash notation.\n\n159\n00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.570\nAnd that's very easy to understand because\nif you just count the number of network\n\n160\n00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.010\nbits that we have,\nthat is how we get this number eight here.\n\n161\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.940\nYou can see that in this first octet, and\n\n162\n00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.080\nactually let's dissect this\naddress a little bit further.\n\n163\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.300\nWe have four octets within an IP\nversion four address, right?\n\n164\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.350\nAnd you can see that here.\n\n165\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.210\nAnd each octet is composed of eight bits.\n\n166\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:03.250\nSo the first octet,\nall these bits are set to 1.\n\n167\n00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.928\nSo that's how I have a /8\nspecifying a slash notation.\n\n168\n00:10:07.928 --> 00:10:10.470\nAnd you can just kinda see\nhow that plays out here.\n\n169\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.700\nSo if you can't remember the numbers for\nthe ranges here, like for\n\n170\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.480\nClass A we have 1 to 127 for\nthat first octet written in decimal.\n\n171\n00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.200\nAnd you can see it written here in binary.\n\n172\n00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.916\nIt's kind of interesting, if you just\nperform a decimal to binary conversion\n\n173\n00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:30.137\nreal quick, you can look at that 0.\n\n174\n00:10:30.137 --> 00:10:33.990\nAnd the 0 there is going to be in,\nlet me specify.\n\n175\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.640\nThe 0 with class four addressing\nis gonna be specifying that class,\n\n176\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.760\nthe actual position of the 0.\n\n177\n00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.800\nSo here with the 0 being in front,\nthis is specifying a Class A address.\n\n178\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.486\nNow as this is 0 for the 128, if you were\nto go ahead and convert that into binary,\n\n179\n00:10:50.486 --> 00:10:53.001\nyou would see what it\nlooks like written out.\n\n180\n00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:56.784\nAnd you'd note that that 0\nis in that second column, or\n\n181\n00:10:56.784 --> 00:11:00.166\nthat second position,\nthus indicating Class B.\n\n182\n00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:02.011\nSo that's like a quick little\nshortcut if you forget and\n\n183\n00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:03.865\nyou're like,\nwhat is the Class B range go to then?\n\n184\n00:11:03.865 --> 00:11:06.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just remember,\n\n185\n00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.450\nyou do have that to fall back on as well.\n\n186\n00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.510\nAnd lastly, I do wanna remind you of\nwhat private addresses are, right?\n\n187\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:19.940\nBecause we do have that limitation of\nthe number of IP addresses that we have\n\n188\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.050\navailable on the public Internet.\n\n189\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:28.118\nSo one way that we can help conserve IP\naddress is by using private addresses.\n\n190\n00:11:28.118 --> 00:11:32.290\nAnd private addresses our only\nroutable within my private network,\n\n191\n00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.380\nlike my local area network.\n\n192\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.750\nAnd I can look in between in this classes,\nand\n\n193\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:42.790\nI can see what kind of IP addresses I\ncan use for those private IP addresses.\n\n194\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.480\nAnd if you guys recall,\nI throw APIPA in here too because APIPA\n\n195\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.270\ntechnically is a private IP address,\nright?\n\n196\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.401\nIt can't be routed on the Internet, and\nthat's what defines a private IP address.\n\n197\n00:11:53.401 --> 00:11:58.490\nSo that's gonna be those\nauto-generated addresses here.\n\n198\n00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.340\nMicrosoft calls them APIPA.\n\n199\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:05.540\nYou'll see it being noted as, what is it,\nlink-local in other operating systems.\n\n200\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.640\nWhich is kind of funny, because when\nwe talk about our IPv6 addressing,\n\n201\n00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.310\nMicrosoft does call their version\nof APIPA in IPv6 link-local.\n\n202\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.470\nSo you'll just note that in\nthe particular ranges that we have there.\n\n203\n00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:24.460\nNow, Mike, what if we wanna break\nthe rules and we just wanna be rebels?\n\n204\n00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.630\nHow do you feel about that?\n\n205\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.511\n&gt;&gt; I like it, I'm ready.\n\n206\n00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:27.615\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\n\n207\n00:12:27.615 --> 00:12:32.914\nwe can do that here with ipv4 addressing\nand it's not too terribl awful.\n\n208\n00:12:32.914 --> 00:12:35.030\nYou'll hear a couple of\ndifferent terms though.\n\n209\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.180\nSometimes you'll hear CIDR class\nlist Inter-Domain Routing.\n\n210\n00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:44.765\nSo remember when I said that placement of\nthat 0 can help identify those classes?\n\n211\n00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:45.340\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n212\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, what if I am being a rebel and\nI'm breaking that rule?\n\n213\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.778\nAnd so now the first octet no\nlonger determines my subnet mask.\n\n214\n00:12:55.778 --> 00:13:00.378\nSo I can't assume that\na Class B address is going\n\n215\n00:13:00.378 --> 00:13:05.323\nto be really using that 255.255.0.0.\n\n216\n00:13:05.323 --> 00:13:06.111\nHow could I tell?\n\n217\n00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:08.280\nJust by looking at it and\nseeing those numbers,\n\n218\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.525\nI wouldn't be able to know, right?\n\n219\n00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Somebody'd have to tell you.\n\n220\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.552\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we can tell you by using\nthat slash to notation to go ahead and\n\n221\n00:13:15.552 --> 00:13:18.048\ndifferentiate between that subnet mask.\n\n222\n00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:21.905\nWhether it's class-full, those\nhistoric ones we were just looking at,\n\n223\n00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:22.980\nversus classless.\n\n224\n00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.280\nSo sometimes you'll hear this term a VLSM,\nwhich stands for\n\n225\n00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.460\nvariable length subnet mask.\n\n226\n00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:34.050\nSo that's specific to\nthe actual subnet mask.\n\n227\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.280\nThat's the term that you use for\n\n228\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.730\nthat subnet mask that doesn't\nfit into those standard classes.\n\n229\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.220\nSo sometimes you'll hear those\nterms being used interchangeably.\n\n230\n00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.737\nWell, they are different because the VLSM\nis gonna be at variable lengths of\n\n231\n00:13:47.737 --> 00:13:48.592\nsubnet mask.\n\n232\n00:13:48.592 --> 00:13:52.025\nWhich allows you to perform\nclassless inter-domain routing, so\n\n233\n00:13:52.025 --> 00:13:53.702\njust kind of noting that there.\n\n234\n00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:54.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit really is gives me the ability,\n\n235\n00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.860\nnormally when we think originally\nwith subnets, and subnet or\n\n236\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:03.240\nsubnet masks, it was always one octet or\ntwo octets or three octets.\n\n237\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.430\nYou dealt with an octet as a unit.\n\n238\n00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.290\nYou didn't think of\nbreaking it in the middle.\n\n239\n00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.710\nAnd now with variable link subnet masks,\nall of a sudden instead of being stuck\n\n240\n00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:17.820\nwith 8, 16, or 24 bit subnet masks, I\ncould do a 20 bit or I could do a 17 bit.\n\n241\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.190\nSo we can really start\nrefining our subnets and\n\n242\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.400\ndefining how many hosts we\nwanna allow on that network.\n\n243\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.859\n&gt;&gt; Mike, you gave a great example.\n\n244\n00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:29.630\nAnd actually, these numbers are already\nhere on the screen, so let's go ahead,\n\n245\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.330\nyou said a /17, right?\n\n246\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.660\nSo let's take a look at how\nthat could happen here.\n\n247\n00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.215\nLet's piggy-back off the Class B here,\n\n248\n00:14:38.215 --> 00:14:41.772\nbecause you can see a Class B\nby default is gonna be a /16.\n\n249\n00:14:41.772 --> 00:14:44.352\nSo 16 + 1 is 17.\n\n250\n00:14:44.352 --> 00:14:46.630\nIt works perfectly for this example here.\n\n251\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.370\nSo let's see how I have\nthis written there.\n\n252\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.243\nAll right, if I were to go ahead and\nchange this 0, and\n\n253\n00:14:54.243 --> 00:14:59.816\nit's called borrowing your bits, so\ntechnically I'm borrowing a post bit.\n\n254\n00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:02.746\nI'm taking away that 0 and I'm adding a 1.\n\n255\n00:15:02.746 --> 00:15:06.168\nAnd of course,\nI'd have to change my color here.\n\n256\n00:15:06.168 --> 00:15:06.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n257\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.140\n&gt;&gt; To stick with that theme.\n\n258\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:14.600\nAnd of course I'd change this now to\na /17, but this is no longer a Class B.\n\n259\n00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:20.420\nThis is a variable link,\noops, subnet mask, all right?\n\n260\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.950\nSo we can see by borrowing that host bit,\nadding it to my network portion,\n\n261\n00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.230\nI just count the number of\nnetwork bits that I have have.\n\n262\n00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.021\nAnd we know that there\nare eight bits in an octet.\n\n263\n00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:34.700\nSo 8 + 8 is 16,\nplus that 1 gives me a /17.\n\n264\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:40.840\nSo now I know that my particular\nnetwork has been modified.\n\n265\n00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.660\nAnd why might I wanna do that?\n\n266\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.120\nIf we look back here,\nwe see the number of networks versus\n\n267\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.280\nthe number of hosts are pretty static and\nthey're set in stone here.\n\n268\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.580\nBut we might not want\nto waste IP addresses.\n\n269\n00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.355\nAnd what does that mean,\nwhat does that look like on our networks?\n\n270\n00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:59.327\nWell, if we're talking about\naddressing and the way\n\n271\n00:15:59.327 --> 00:16:03.897\nthe routing tables store information and\nsending out broadcast transmissions.\n\n272\n00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:07.990\nWe can create smaller\nsegments on our networks for\n\n273\n00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.070\nperformance to help with\nthose routing issues.\n\n274\n00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.270\nAnd we can also do it for\n\n275\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.430\nlogical divisions to help\njust keep track of things.\n\n276\n00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.420\nWe can do it for security reasons.\n\n277\n00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.490\nSo there's definitely a benefit in\ntaking the extra time to go ahead and\n\n278\n00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.860\nperform something that we call subnetting.\n\n279\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.986\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a really great\nway to segregate out traffic.\n\n280\n00:16:30.986 --> 00:16:34.240\nIn IPv4, we've got what we call, and we\nhaven't talked about this yet, we'll get\n\n281\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.540\nto it, but it's called broadcast traffic\nthat goes out to all nodes on the network.\n\n282\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.754\nAnd when we think about Eehernet,\nit's contention based,\n\n283\n00:16:41.754 --> 00:16:44.220\nit's not deterministic\nlike say token ring.\n\n284\n00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.170\nSo in ethernet,\nyou have to fight for time.\n\n285\n00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.761\nAnd I use an analogy thinking like,\nif you're in a room of 100 people,\n\n286\n00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:55.315\nhow easy is it if everybody's talking,\nhow easy is it for\n\n287\n00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:59.332\nyou to say something and\nnot get interrupted by everybody else?\n\n288\n00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:02.183\nBut if I take those 100 people and\ndivide them up into groups of 10 and\n\n289\n00:17:02.183 --> 00:17:05.107\nput them in separate rooms, it's a lot\neasier for me to communicate now.\n\n290\n00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.400\nBecause I'm only competing\nwith nine other people.\n\n291\n00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.533\nAnd it's the same thing with subnets,\nright?\n\n292\n00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:13.334\nIf I've got a subnet like\na Class B that could have 65,534,\n\n293\n00:17:13.334 --> 00:17:16.650\nI think, hosts on it,\nthat means my node has to compete,\n\n294\n00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:21.096\nassuming we have all those nodes\npopulated, with all of those other nodes.\n\n295\n00:17:21.096 --> 00:17:24.681\nWhereas if I break it down,\nI can make smaller chunks out of it,\n\n296\n00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:26.590\nmakes it easier to communicate.\n\n297\n00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.543\nAnd if I send out a broadcast,\nit doesn't go to all 65,000.\n\n298\n00:17:29.543 --> 00:17:33.122\nIt only goes to my subnet, which is\nhopefully a smaller number of units,\n\n299\n00:17:33.122 --> 00:17:33.659\nor nodes.\n\n300\n00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:38.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and something that I\nkinda wish someone would've told me when\n\n301\n00:17:38.255 --> 00:17:41.840\nI was first learning subnet was\nthis little chart right here.\n\n302\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.400\nSo I wanna share with you this\nparticular chart right here.\n\n303\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.430\nAnd this is all very,\nvery simple, very easy, guys.\n\n304\n00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:55.800\nAll this is, is the equivalent, so we have\non left-hand column, we have the binary.\n\n305\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.980\nOn the right-hand,\nwe have the decimal equivalent.\n\n306\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.030\nSo this is just a simple conversion.\n\n307\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.970\nAnd if you don't know how to convert,\nit's really easy.\n\n308\n00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.760\nI've done shows on it, and I know\nI'm sure several of us have as well.\n\n309\n00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.820\nFor the exams, you need to know how\nto convert by hand, the manual way.\n\n310\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.880\nBut, of course,\nwe have even subnet calculators and\n\n311\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.100\nconversion calculators in real life\nin the production environment.\n\n312\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.710\nSo just gonna take it\ninto the basics here.\n\n313\n00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.560\nBut there is one essential\nrule that we cannot break,\n\n314\n00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.352\nwhether we're talking about\nclass full subnet masks or\n\n315\n00:18:31.352 --> 00:18:34.710\nif we're dealing with\na variable link subnet mask.\n\n316\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.834\nAnd that rule is going to be that our ones\nare always contiguous to the left and\n\n317\n00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:42.710\nour zeros are always\ncontiguous to the right.\n\n318\n00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.090\nSo we can't have a mix match in between.\n\n319\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.740\nThat's the rule that we cannot break here.\n\n320\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:53.450\nSo if we look at these numbers\nwritten out in binary on the left,\n\n321\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.390\nall of my ones are to the left, here.\n\n322\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:59.144\nAnd I'm representing the eight\nbits with our eight numbers here.\n\n323\n00:18:59.144 --> 00:19:04.364\nSo on the right-hand side,\nlooking at this in decimal notation,\n\n324\n00:19:04.364 --> 00:19:09.121\nthese are the only possible\ndecimal numbers that I can use for\n\n325\n00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:12.280\nmy variable lengths of net masks.\n\n326\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.394\nAnd an interesting term here, so\n\n327\n00:19:14.394 --> 00:19:19.524\n[LAUGH] I didn't mean to say that because\nit's called the interesting octet.\n\n328\n00:19:19.524 --> 00:19:22.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wherever that change is\n\n329\n00:19:22.547 --> 00:19:27.131\nhappening, so you can see here,\nlike Mike was talking about,\n\n330\n00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:31.541\nall of our network bits for\nthat historical Class A, B and C,\n\n331\n00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:35.458\nthey're all the same withing\none particular octet.\n\n332\n00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:42.200\nHere in that VLSM that we created,\nthere's a division in between an octet.\n\n333\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.413\nSo wherever that division is occurring,\n\n334\n00:19:45.413 --> 00:19:49.000\nthat octet is called\nyour interesting octet.\n\n335\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.080\nSo just throwing that out there as well.\n\n336\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.976\nJust some good terms to know there.\n\n337\n00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:57.291\n&gt;&gt; And probably, well, let's back up for\none second cuz I know you used that term,\n\n338\n00:19:57.291 --> 00:19:58.057\ncontiguous.\n\n339\n00:19:58.057 --> 00:20:00.650\nI wanna make sure cuz I'm like, wait,\nwhat the heck, contiguous, right?\n\n340\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.523\nSo you're saying the ones\nhave to be touching, right?\n\n341\n00:20:04.523 --> 00:20:07.724\nYou're never gonna have a one,\nonce you go to your zero,\n\n342\n00:20:07.724 --> 00:20:09.495\nyou cannot have any more ones.\n\n343\n00:20:09.495 --> 00:20:10.194\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n344\n00:20:10.194 --> 00:20:12.044\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou'll never have a zero in between ones.\n\n345\n00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.970\nYou go one, one, one, one, one, zero.\n\n346\n00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.100\nOnce it goes to a zero,\nit's gonna be zeros the rest of the way.\n\n347\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.140\nAnd another refresher from doing that\nbinary ANDing with our subnet mask, which,\n\n348\n00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.690\nagain, hopefully you guys\nare familiar with this.\n\n349\n00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:26.850\nIf not, make sure you go back and\n\n350\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.050\ncheck out some of the Net+ lessons where\nwe show you how to do the binary ANDing.\n\n351\n00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.004\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n&gt;&gt; But that interesting octet,\n\n352\n00:20:33.004 --> 00:20:34.956\nbecause if the octet is all ones,\n\n353\n00:20:34.956 --> 00:20:38.886\nthe number falls straight through\nwhen you do your binary ANDing.\n\n354\n00:20:38.886 --> 00:20:40.496\nSo those octets don't change.\n\n355\n00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:43.658\nWhatever's above it, what you're ANDing it\nwith, it's the same thing as the bottom.\n\n356\n00:20:43.658 --> 00:20:44.873\nSo nothing interesting there, right?\n\n357\n00:20:44.873 --> 00:20:46.283\nWe just write the number.\n\n358\n00:20:46.283 --> 00:20:49.488\nThe zero's block everything,\nso if the octet is all zeroes,\n\n359\n00:20:49.488 --> 00:20:53.270\nthen you just write zeros bellow it,\nthe ANDing is very simple.\n\n360\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:57.925\nIt's that one octet where we have\nthe switch from the ones to the zeros.\n\n361\n00:20:57.925 --> 00:20:58.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n362\n00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.028\n&gt;&gt; That's where-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Our routers are really\n\n363\n00:21:01.028 --> 00:21:01.647\nconcerned with.\n\n364\n00:21:01.647 --> 00:21:03.200\nBecause that's what\nthey're really looking at.\n\n365\n00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.810\nIt's interesting to them.\n\n366\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.170\nSo they know where to go ahead and\nroute that traffic.\n\n367\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.139\nSo that's what we're seeing there.\n\n368\n00:21:08.139 --> 00:21:09.143\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n369\n00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:14.816\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what if we were\ntasked with subnetting a network?\n\n370\n00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.158\nSo here this is kind of\na silly diagram here.\n\n371\n00:21:18.158 --> 00:21:19.134\nI had it from before.\n\n372\n00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:22.650\nI just said, hey,\nmaybe we've got three particular networks.\n\n373\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.640\nWe've got A, B and C.\n\n374\n00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.363\nMaybe it's a WAN link here, whatever.\n\n375\n00:21:27.363 --> 00:21:28.131\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n376\n00:21:28.131 --> 00:21:32.506\nBut if you think about how many networks\nare required to fulfill some kind\n\n377\n00:21:32.506 --> 00:21:36.451\nof diagram, like specifically like this,\nyou might think about\n\n378\n00:21:36.451 --> 00:21:41.199\nnetwork one being one particular network,\nnetwork two, and network three.\n\n379\n00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:45.661\nBut keep in mind, you also need a point to\npoint network here a link whenever you're\n\n380\n00:21:45.661 --> 00:21:46.760\nconnecting those.\n\n381\n00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.991\nAnd if you are having another link there,\n\n382\n00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:51.610\nyou would need one to\nsatisfy that as well.\n\n383\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:57.050\nSo just looking at this configuration,\nI would need a minimum of five networks.\n\n384\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:03.510\nSo in order to do that, I'll show\nyou a very easy way at least for me.\n\n385\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.968\nI really did struggle with\nsubnetting a while ago, and\n\n386\n00:22:06.968 --> 00:22:09.837\nthen I found this method and\nit just clicked.\n\n387\n00:22:09.837 --> 00:22:11.485\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And for some of you,\n\n388\n00:22:11.485 --> 00:22:14.874\nthis is the Breaking it Down Barney Style.\n\n389\n00:22:14.874 --> 00:22:16.725\nI've had students tell me that\nthat's what this is called.\n\n390\n00:22:16.725 --> 00:22:18.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I guess it's a [INAUDIBLE] thing,\n\n391\n00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:22.029\nI don't know, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or a cartoon, I don't know.\n\n392\n00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:25.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n393\n00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.170\nI'll tell you what, though,\nwe've had guests such as Todd Lammle, and\n\n394\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.200\nI know Ronnie.\n\n395\n00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.180\nAnd in their Cisco shows ,they even show\nyou guys more advanced techniques of how\n\n396\n00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.300\nyou can actually subnet in your head.\n\n397\n00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.230\nAnd boy, do I wanna be like them\nwhen I grow up, [LAUGH] for real.\n\n398\n00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.860\nSo for now, I'm just gonna quickly\nshow you this so we can see why we'd\n\n399\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.500\nwant to know how to do that so\nwe can input it like I said before.\n\n400\n00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.805\nSo perhaps I got an IP address assigned to\nme from my Internet service provider of\n\n401\n00:22:52.805 --> 00:23:00.410\n216.10.1.0, which is a Class C address.\n\n402\n00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:08.011\nAnd we should know that that subnet mask\nwould look like a /24 of 255.255.255.0.\n\n403\n00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:10.680\nSo that's assumed as well.\n\n404\n00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.240\nI have these numbers\nwritten out here because\n\n405\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.390\nI just use this as a little\ntrick whenever I'm taking exams.\n\n406\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.678\nA little, I call it a delta chart.\n\n407\n00:23:20.678 --> 00:23:22.277\nI don't think that's the technical name.\n\n408\n00:23:22.277 --> 00:23:26.455\nBut anyways,\nit's just like 2 to the power of 0 = 1.\n\n409\n00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:30.250\n2 to the power of 1 = 2, and\nthen exponentially going out you'll see.\n\n410\n00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:35.930\nAnd even if you were to go ahead and\ncontinue with this pattern,\n\n411\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:41.100\nyou'd see a lot of numbers like 256,\n512, 1024.\n\n412\n00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.170\nAnd those numbers should be\nfamiliar to you because we see them\n\n413\n00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.460\na lot in computing.\n\n414\n00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.174\nBecause binary, well,\nwe only have two options, [LAUGH] so\n\n415\n00:23:49.174 --> 00:23:51.270\nwe see a lot of repetition there.\n\n416\n00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.267\nBut what we're gonna do is we are-\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n417\n00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:54.883\nwe could just keep on going, right?\n\n418\n00:23:54.883 --> 00:23:57.031\n2 to 48, 40, 96, 81, 96.\n\n419\n00:23:57.031 --> 00:23:59.710\n&gt;&gt; Oo, you might wanna get the calculator.\n\n420\n00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.770\n&gt;&gt; You should know those.\n\n421\n00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:01.834\n&gt;&gt; I should know those?\n\n422\n00:24:01.834 --> 00:24:03.928\n[LAUGH] I don't.\n\n423\n00:24:03.928 --> 00:24:05.777\nAnyway-\n&gt;&gt; We can definitely stop at\n\n424\n00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:06.420\nthe eighth bit.\n\n425\n00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.970\nIf we're doing IPv4 addresses As long\nas we know our powers out to the eight,\n\n426\n00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.093\nwe're good to go.\n\n427\n00:24:12.093 --> 00:24:16.167\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you really might need\nto get that calculator [CROSSTALK],\n\n428\n00:24:16.167 --> 00:24:17.532\nI am slow at math here.\n\n429\n00:24:17.532 --> 00:24:22.472\nSo [LAUGH] if we take the number\nfive because that is what, ooh,\n\n430\n00:24:22.472 --> 00:24:24.385\nthat is not a five.\n\n431\n00:24:24.385 --> 00:24:28.525\nThat's what we were assigned just from\nlooking at that diagram, we say okay,\n\n432\n00:24:28.525 --> 00:24:32.465\nwe know we at least need to have\nfive different networks there,\n\n433\n00:24:32.465 --> 00:24:34.455\nthat's our minimum, all right.\n\n434\n00:24:34.455 --> 00:24:36.835\nSo what is it gonna take for\nus to get there?\n\n435\n00:24:36.835 --> 00:24:41.555\nSo if we take this number five and\nperform that binary conversion actually,\n\n436\n00:24:41.555 --> 00:24:44.555\nwe don't need any calculations\nto perform this conversion.\n\n437\n00:24:44.555 --> 00:24:48.130\nIt's super easy because\nif I take this five and\n\n438\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.946\nI'm trying to think like a computer here.\n\n439\n00:24:50.946 --> 00:24:53.720\nActually that 5 is a little small,\nlet me make it larger, so we can see that.\n\n440\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.526\nYou guys might be able to see it,\nbut I'm pretty blind, so\n\n441\n00:24:58.526 --> 00:25:00.660\n[LAUGH] we gotta think like a computer.\n\n442\n00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.370\nSo we say hey, 1 being yes,\n\n443\n00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:09.340\n0 being no, can we take 128 out of 5,\nso we say no.\n\n444\n00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:14.200\nCan we take 64 out of 5,\nwe say no, same with 32,\n\n445\n00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.200\n16, 8, we finally get to 4 and\nwe can use a 1.\n\n446\n00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.740\nAnd that's what the routers and\nthe computers are thinking here.\n\n447\n00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:27.610\nAnd so I can see that it takes at least 3\nbits, that 4, 2, and 1 essentially here,\n\n448\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:32.420\nto go ahead and\ncreate a network of at least 5 here.\n\n449\n00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:38.370\nSo, the reason I use this\nlittle chart it helps me is\n\n450\n00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.790\nto be able to discern what my\nincrement will be, all right?\n\n451\n00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.190\nSo it's just a three step process.\n\n452\n00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:48.410\nSo I can reserve the bits in\nthe subnet mask to find your increment.\n\n453\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:53.320\nIf we take that original class C\nsubnet mask, we it's a slash 24,\n\n454\n00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.800\nso 24 network bits.\n\n455\n00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.858\nNow if I were to go ahead and\nthink about my interesting octet,\n\n456\n00:26:00.858 --> 00:26:03.410\nright, that's where that\nchange is happening.\n\n457\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:08.270\nSo if I add an additional three\nnetwork bits because we just got that\n\n458\n00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.810\nnumber three, we decided that we needed\nthree to make at least five networks.\n\n459\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.680\nSo I would add three network bits, and\n\n460\n00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:22.680\nthen I would still have five zeroes for\nthat interesting octet.\n\n461\n00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.560\nLet me just go ahead and\ntype it up all out here.\n\n462\n00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.262\nSo it would be 255, [LAUGH],\nI'm mixing decimal and binary here.\n\n463\n00:26:30.262 --> 00:26:31.070\nSo one, two, three, four [CROSSTALK].\n\n464\n00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:35.005\n&gt;&gt; You're borrowing three bits from\nthe host to represent your five networks,\n\n465\n00:26:35.005 --> 00:26:38.990\nyou need at least three bits to create\nyour five networks that you need.\n\n466\n00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:44.230\nBut then we know with subnet masks,\nonce we end the 1s, 0s begin.\n\n467\n00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.500\nEight bits in an octet,\nwe've borrowed three, that leaves five, so\n\n468\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.820\nthat's how you got the five 0s, right?\n\n469\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, these three right here,\nthose are our new ones.\n\n470\n00:26:51.445 --> 00:26:55.680\nThose are our borrowed bits there, so\nyep, although we'll never give them back.\n\n471\n00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.240\nCan I borrow your pen, Mike?\n\n472\n00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.210\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n473\n00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.142\n&gt;&gt; But anyway, so\n\n474\n00:27:01.142 --> 00:27:02.970\nthose are our borrowed bits.\n\n475\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.740\nSo what I can do now is take\nthese interesting octet,\n\n476\n00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.970\nwhich here is our fourth octet, right?\n\n477\n00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:13.350\nAnd I can kind of plug it in to\nmy handy-dandy little chart here.\n\n478\n00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:18.340\nAnd notice that my poor little guy\nleast significant network bit.\n\n479\n00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.060\nThat is going to be my network bit\nthat is all the way to my right, so\n\n480\n00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.400\nbasically my last one here.\n\n481\n00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.410\nSo if I plug that into my\nlittle chart that I've created,\n\n482\n00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:29.750\nI can follow the columns.\n\n483\n00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.513\nSo,this will be plugged in to a 1,\na 1 and a 32.\n\n484\n00:27:33.513 --> 00:27:37.945\nSo my least significant network bet\nis being represented by a 32, so\n\n485\n00:27:37.945 --> 00:27:41.215\nthat's what I'm gonna be\nusing as my increment.\n\n486\n00:27:41.215 --> 00:27:44.305\nSo it's actually pretty\neasy to go ahead and\n\n487\n00:27:44.305 --> 00:27:48.133\nfind out what my network range is\nare gonna be at this point in time.\n\n488\n00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:52.951\nIf I take my original IP\naddress that was assigned to me\n\n489\n00:27:52.951 --> 00:27:56.710\nhere by my ISP at 216.10.1.0.\n\n490\n00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.490\nWhat I'm gonna do is add\n32 to that last octet,\n\n491\n00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.824\nI'm gonna be starting here at 0, right?\n\n492\n00:28:03.824 --> 00:28:06.064\nSo 0 plus 32 is?\n\n493\n00:28:06.064 --> 00:28:07.890\nDo we need the calculator?\n\n494\n00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.713\n&gt;&gt; No, I think we got that one.\n\n495\n00:28:08.713 --> 00:28:13.534\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, and then we'll know that\n\n496\n00:28:13.534 --> 00:28:19.320\nthe network ID for\nnetwork two is going to be 216.10.1.32.\n\n497\n00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.270\nAnd we can proceed just\ngoing through this looking\n\n498\n00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.830\nat adding 32 all the way down here.\n\n499\n00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:32.110\nSo we've got 64, 96, 128, and\nI went ahead and did an extra,\n\n500\n00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:36.510\ncreated an extra network\nhere just because it's easy.\n\n501\n00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:42.000\nWhen you think about well, how do I\ndefine that full range there because\n\n502\n00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.410\nthe full range exists by subtracting one.\n\n503\n00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:50.457\nSo, I have not completely lined up here,\nand let me just show you.\n\n504\n00:28:50.457 --> 00:28:51.470\nAll right.\n\n505\n00:28:54.915 --> 00:28:56.537\nThere we go, that's correct.\n\n506\n00:28:56.537 --> 00:29:00.030\n[LAUGH] I'm looking at them\nlike that's not lined up right.\n\n507\n00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:08.320\nAll right, so for network one,\nI have 216.10.1.0.\n\n508\n00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.995\nThat's my first IP address.\n\n509\n00:29:09.995 --> 00:29:13.380\nIt's not my first assignable IP address,\nbut my first IP address.\n\n510\n00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.457\nMy last IP address is one less\nthan the following network,\n\n511\n00:29:18.457 --> 00:29:21.679\nso I have 216.10.1.31.\n\n512\n00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:26.330\nNow something special about that first and\nthe last IP address there.\n\n513\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.360\nSo our first address is gonna be\nreferencing that network ID and\n\n514\n00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.890\nthe last here is gonna be signifying\nthe broadcast transmission.\n\n515\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.510\nThat's the one Mike was talking about\nbeing in that room at that party or\n\n516\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.370\nwhatever with those 100 people.\n\n517\n00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:44.720\nSo that's how I can send a message to\nall of the other 99 people in that room,\n\n518\n00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.130\nso they can all hear me, right.\n\n519\n00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.800\nAnd that's just why I did\nan extra one here for\n\n520\n00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.990\n160 because I can easily see that\n159 would be my broadcast there.\n\n521\n00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just a quick little trick,\n\n522\n00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.410\nI wanted to share this with you also.\n\n523\n00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.737\nLet me get rid of this, it's bothering me.\n\n524\n00:30:02.737 --> 00:30:07.369\nAll right, 2 to the power of x is a quick\nlittle trick that you can use whenever you\n\n525\n00:30:07.369 --> 00:30:10.880\nwanna find out the number\nof available networks here.\n\n526\n00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.650\nSo in our situation,\n\n527\n00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:17.330\nx is going to be equivalent to the number\nof new network bits that we've added.\n\n528\n00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.253\nSo if you think back to the number\nof network bits that we added,\n\n529\n00:30:20.253 --> 00:30:21.258\nthat was gonna be 3.\n\n530\n00:30:21.258 --> 00:30:25.695\nSo 2 to the power of 3 here is\ngoing to be equaling 8, so,\n\n531\n00:30:25.695 --> 00:30:30.780\nIf I needed five networks,\nhere I have the potential of having 8.\n\n532\n00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.510\nSo I'm only wasting 3,\nwhereas if I were to go back\n\n533\n00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:39.710\nto my class C, my class full addresses,\n\n534\n00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:44.190\nI can see class C, the number of\nnetworks I have over 2 million.\n\n535\n00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.850\nSo I'm wasting a lot less, I mean for\nfive networks to go ahead and\n\n536\n00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.760\nassign that full class C.\n\n537\n00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.580\nThat's what we're talking\nabout when we're saving or\n\n538\n00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.930\npreserving those IP addresses here.\n\n539\n00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.310\nAnd then lastly,\nthere was one more way you could look at\n\n540\n00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.520\nthe number of possible hosts per network\nand this was pretty easy as well.\n\n541\n00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.350\nIf we take 2 to the power of x minus 2.\n\n542\n00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:11.600\nMinus 2 signifying that network bit or\nthat network address,\n\n543\n00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.370\nthe first one and the broadcast\naddress being that second one.\n\n544\n00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.012\nSo we subtract 2 because\ncan't assign those.\n\n545\n00:31:17.012 --> 00:31:22.050\nBut that's going to give us the possible\nhosts that we can have per network.\n\n546\n00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:27.200\nAnd here x, our variable, is going to\nbe referencing the number of host bits.\n\n547\n00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.320\nSo if I scroll up, I can just count here\nthat my host bits are going to be one two,\n\n548\n00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.470\nthree, four, five.\n\n549\n00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.960\nSo if I take 2 to the power of 5,\nthat would give me 32 minus 2,\n\n550\n00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.580\nmeaning I can have 30 end users or\nnodes, printers,\n\n551\n00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.090\nservers, whatever,\nwithin each one of these networks here.\n\n552\n00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.630\nSo that's why and\nhow we would go ahead and break those up.\n\n553\n00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:55.209\nSo how does that relate to Server 2012 R2?\n\n554\n00:31:55.209 --> 00:31:58.768\nWell, when we look at different settings\nand we're assigning those IP addresses,\n\n555\n00:31:58.768 --> 00:32:02.840\nwe have to be cognizant of how we're\ncreating those divisions and separations.\n\n556\n00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.720\nAs well as even configuring\nother core network services,\n\n557\n00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.830\nlike DHCP and creating those scopes there.\n\n558\n00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.980\nSo just kind of reminding\nyou how that happens.\n\n559\n00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.550\nAnd I'm looking at the time and\nI think we're out of time but\n\n560\n00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:19.690\nwe have a lot more to cover here,\nso you don't wanna miss out.\n\n561\n00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.874\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, all right, that means\nwe'll be coming back for a part two,\n\n562\n00:32:23.874 --> 00:32:25.666\nconfiguring IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n563\n00:32:25.666 --> 00:32:28.820\nGood stuff so far, Cherokee,\nlooking forward to that next part.\n\n564\n00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.290\nHope you guys are too.\n\n565\n00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.240\nFor now signing off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n566\n00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.163\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n567\n00:32:34.163 --> 00:32:36.123\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n568\n00:32:36.123 --> 00:32:42.053\n[MUSIC]\n\n569\n00:32:42.053 --> 00:32:45.328\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:11.599\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.390\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our MCSA Server\n\n6\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.630\n2012 in preparation for that 70-410 Exam.\n\n7\n00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.310\nIn this episode, we're focusing\nin on Configuring IPv4 and v6.\n\n8\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.200\nThis is a part two, so if you missed part\none make sure you go back and check that\n\n9\n00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.300\nout, so that you can catch up with us\nwhere we are here for this part two.\n\n10\n00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.640\nAnd back in the studios today is Miss\nCherokee Boose, welcome back Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.520\n&gt;&gt; Hi, how's it going, Mike?\n\n12\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.110\n&gt;&gt; Going fantastic, glad you're here.\n\n13\n00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.560\nExcited to pick up where we left off,\n\n14\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.020\nwe were talking about subnetting\nan IPv4 I think at the end of part one.\n\n15\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.470\n&gt;&gt; And so I think that's a great\nplace to pick back up here because\n\n16\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.330\nwe need to really look at the IPv4, and\n\n17\n00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.310\nthen we'll move on forward to IPv6\ncome and get timeline there, right?\n\n18\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.032\n&gt;&gt; Skip an IP version 5?\n\n19\n00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:03.994\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What happened to that?\n\n20\n00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:06.607\n&gt;&gt; It just got folded up and,\nyeah [LAUGH].\n\n21\n00:01:06.607 --> 00:01:08.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Anyhoo.\n\n22\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.430\nOkay, so we did look at subnetting and\nthat was a way that we\n\n23\n00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.800\ncould logically separate portions\nof our network for reasons.\n\n24\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.940\nSuch as, Mike gave a really good\nexample about having the hundred people\n\n25\n00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.160\nin the room, and being able to prevent\nany kind of collisions there, or\n\n26\n00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.790\nbeing able to communicate\nwithout being interrupted.\n\n27\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.610\nSo what if we wanted to perform something\nlike the transverse of that, and we wanted\n\n28\n00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.710\nto take, maybe we inherited a network\nthat was already segmented, subnetted.\n\n29\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.440\nBut we wanted to do something called\nsupernetting or route summarization,\n\n30\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.020\nroute aggregation, maybe for\nthe purpose of reducing the amount of\n\n31\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.540\ninformation that our routers needed to\nmaintain within those routing tables.\n\n32\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.320\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n33\n00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.870\nYeah, cuz as we add more and more subnets,\neach one of those becomes a route in\n\n34\n00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.850\nthat routing table and\nthat's more work on the router.\n\n35\n00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.578\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nany time I can remember less information,\n\n36\n00:02:03.578 --> 00:02:05.690\nthat's always going to be a plus for me.\n\n37\n00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n38\n00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:09.360\nI'm thinking the routers feel\nthe same way, I don't know.\n\n39\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.250\nSo, I'll just briefly show you kind\nof what I'm talking about here.\n\n40\n00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.170\nYou're not going to be,\nit's one of those things again,\n\n41\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.000\nlike Microsoft just says hey,\nif you're not familiar with it,\n\n42\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.660\nyou should just kind of revisit that\nbefore getting into the exam booth here.\n\n43\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.340\nBut the example I just wanted to show, why\nwe would use that and kind of what that\n\n44\n00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.270\nlooked like is if I were to have\ndifferent portions of my network here,\n\n45\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.270\nmaybe a segment for my VOIP phones, I have\nmy security cameras all on one segment.\n\n46\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.880\nMy teller machines, as well as,\n\n47\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.790\na separate segment there for\nmy ATM machines here at a bank.\n\n48\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.310\nSo that makes sense right?\n\n49\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.750\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it could be done for\n\n50\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.680\na little bit of security, it could be to\nmake sure that the VOIP traffic doesn't\n\n51\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.280\naffect my teller's ability to\ndo their job, or ATMs from\n\n52\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.010\nprocessing transaction because there's\ntoo many phone calls going on, right?\n\n53\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.130\nSo by separating out that traffic,\nyou know,\n\n54\n00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.350\nwe can keep the bandwidth\nutilization down.\n\n55\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.199\n&gt;&gt; Right, so if we were to look at that,\n\n56\n00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:11.202\nand say, someone had already separated\nthe [INAUDIBLE] like a slash 26 there,\n\n57\n00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:14.600\nthen what can I do to aggregate that or\nto help out my routers.\n\n58\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.960\nSo the reason I have it written\nout in decimal and binary, is so\n\n59\n00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.870\nyou can kind of see where these dividing\nlines are happening, and currently,\n\n60\n00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.810\nyou can see that with that slash 22 or\nexcuse me, 26 here.\n\n61\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.410\nI'm two network bytes over from that\nnormal what we would see, if you think\n\n62\n00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.130\nabout just the regular slash 24 and\nthat's what we wanna get back to there.\n\n63\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.400\nOr if that's where we\nhad started originally.\n\n64\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.250\nSo what you can do is when you write\nin out in binary, it does help for\n\n65\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.510\nthis process, and\nyou look at that dividing line.\n\n66\n00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.610\nSo if I were to see this is\nwhere we are currently, and\n\n67\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.040\nI want to kind of change that to a slash\n24 for the aggregation purposes,\n\n68\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.890\nthen I would need to go ahead and\nmove that.\n\n69\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:05.200\nSo with the help of our ANDing process\nthere I can go ahead and everything that.\n\n70\n00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.010\nDepending on where your dividing line is,\neverything to the left is going to be one,\n\n71\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.580\neverything to the right\nis going to be zeroes.\n\n72\n00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.280\nSo I can aggregate them and essentially,\nif I were to change that dividing line\n\n73\n00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.550\nover by two, I could go ahead and\nhave a slash 24.\n\n74\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.652\nAnd of course each one of these portions,\nthese segments would still be part of that\n\n75\n00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:30.130\nslash 24, but it would just be easier for\nthe routers to discern that information.\n\n76\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI think that's a great example there.\n\n77\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.822\nIf you move that red\nline back over to the /26\n\n78\n00:04:34.822 --> 00:04:35.542\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n79\n00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:39.994\n&gt;&gt; Right, we can see that each one of\nthose is a different network, very easy to\n\n80\n00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:44.600\ntell the last 2 bits are different for\nall four of those routes or the subnets.\n\n81\n00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.928\nBut as soon as you move that line 2\nbits to the left, now the subnet,\n\n82\n00:04:50.928 --> 00:04:55.280\nto the left of that line all four of\nthose subnets, look exactly the same.\n\n83\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n84\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.570\nWhich is what allows me to\nnow use one mask slash 24 to\n\n85\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.160\nrepresent all four of those subnets,\nall right?\n\n86\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.436\nAnd again this done on a router,\nit's not dissolving the subnets, right?\n\n87\n00:05:08.436 --> 00:05:11.900\nThere's still separate subnets, but\nas far as the router's concerned,\n\n88\n00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.450\nif all four these subnets were down\nthe same path, the router can now have\n\n89\n00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.510\none route to all four of those networks,\nrather than having four routes that\n\n90\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.010\nit has to go through, every time\ntraffic's bound to one of those subnets.\n\n91\n00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\njust like a couple different things,\n\n92\n00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.190\nif you're not too familiar with it, then\ndefinitely check that out a little more.\n\n93\n00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.890\nI'm sure we have shows here\nin our course library.\n\n94\n00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.560\nBut now let's think about moving forward.\n\n95\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.410\nSo we did say we're gonna go ahead and\nskip IP version 5,\n\n96\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.060\nbut what about in that interim there.\n\n97\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.180\nWhat do we do for these,\nyou know, transitioning.\n\n98\n00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.880\nAnd what do those different types\nof transmissions look like.\n\n99\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.420\nSo I just happen to have\ntransmission types right here.\n\n100\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.930\nSome of them are the same.\n\n101\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.180\nThey share different\ntypes of transmissions.\n\n102\n00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.270\nBut some of them are unique\nto the different versions.\n\n103\n00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.960\nUnicast, all right, so\nUnicast we're gonna see in both IPv4 and\n\n104\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.370\nIPv6, so it's gonna be just there\nwith our wonder one communication.\n\n105\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.210\nAnd so\nwith IPv4 that Unicast could look like,\n\n106\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.120\nit could look like a private address,\nit could look like a public address.\n\n107\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.220\nLet me zoom in a little bit so that we\ncan see these a little more specific.\n\n108\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.485\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, I was just gonna ask you.\n\n109\n00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:22.273\nI can't see, I'm old.\n\n110\n00:06:22.273 --> 00:06:23.457\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am too.\n\n111\n00:06:23.457 --> 00:06:25.338\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's better.\n\n112\n00:06:25.338 --> 00:06:26.882\n&gt;&gt; I believe this helps you guys, as well.\n\n113\n00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:29.907\nBut a Unicast identifies a single\ninterface and is used for\n\n114\n00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:32.080\nhost to host communication, all right.\n\n115\n00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.800\nSo we see that in both IPv4, IPv6.\n\n116\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.910\nAnd I've just noted some different\nexamples, as well as their prefix policies\n\n117\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.980\nhere for different types of addresses that\ncan utilize Unicast transmissions here.\n\n118\n00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.820\nThis is kind of interesting though,\nwe do have a couple deprecated terms.\n\n119\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.790\nIf you guys are out on the internet and\nyou know you are studying and\n\n120\n00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.840\nyou come across some kind of\ndocumentation that reference.\n\n121\n00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.130\nAnd even Microsoft on some of their\nsites haven't been fully updated.\n\n122\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.590\nBut it might says something like,\nsite local address, which\n\n123\n00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.400\nIs basically going to be referencing\nconfined to that particular LAN.\n\n124\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.450\nBut that's not a term\nthat's really used anymore.\n\n125\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.950\nSo just know that that's an old\ndocument that you're reading.\n\n126\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.450\nAs well as,\n\n127\n00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:22.350\nif you see something like the term\nspecified is IPv4 compatible addresses.\n\n128\n00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.740\nSo if you reference the RFCs then they\ncan explain that a little bit more and\n\n129\n00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.220\ntell you what the well we'll see here,\nwhat the newer terminology is called.\n\n130\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.540\nSo again, in IPv4 and IPv6,\nwe have multicast transmissions.\n\n131\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.930\nSo if you think about that.\n\n132\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.866\nAnd I was always using this example,\nlike pay-per-view shows.\n\n133\n00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:47.745\nSo not everyone on that,\n\n134\n00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:52.847\nnot everyone who has cable gets\na particular pay-per-view show.\n\n135\n00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.496\nIt’s only whoever pays for it.\n\n136\n00:07:54.496 --> 00:07:58.752\nSo if you’re part of that multicast group\nThen you would get to watch that show or\n\n137\n00:07:58.752 --> 00:08:03.340\nthat fight, or whatever kind of sporting\nevent that you had ordered, right?\n\n138\n00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.725\nSo what does that look\nlike with IP Version 4?\n\n139\n00:08:05.725 --> 00:08:10.502\nWell, here, we have particular addresses\nthat are gonna be reserved for\n\n140\n00:08:10.502 --> 00:08:12.755\nthose multicast transmissions.\n\n141\n00:08:12.755 --> 00:08:17.155\nWhereas IP version six,\nwe're gonna see that prefix\n\n142\n00:08:17.155 --> 00:08:21.785\npolicy there with that FF to go ahead and\nindicate, and there are variants of that.\n\n143\n00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:23.640\nBut just generally speaking you,\n\n144\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.700\nyou need to know minimum that's\nwhat you would need to know there.\n\n145\n00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.350\nJust specifying that bit flag in the\nparticular field if you, you're not gonna\n\n146\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:39.770\nbe quiz on the exact makeup of\nthe IP version six composition here.\n\n147\n00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.450\nBut I'm definitely gonna break that down\nfor you, and show you what it looks like.\n\n148\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.240\nEspecially compared to the 32\nbits that we'd seen before.\n\n149\n00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.590\nAnd we spent a good time talking about\nthat network portion versus the host\n\n150\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.039\nportion, and\nwe'll see how that works here in IPv6 too.\n\n151\n00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:57.450\nAll right, Broadcast,\nthis is a funny one here.\n\n152\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.576\nSo Broadcast was going to be.\n\n153\n00:09:00.576 --> 00:09:04.608\nYou guys saw whenever we did our\nsubnetting in the last episode, and\n\n154\n00:09:04.608 --> 00:09:09.066\nwe said hey, this Broadcast address,\nthat last address of that network,\n\n155\n00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:12.840\nis going to be reserved for or\nthat particular communication.\n\n156\n00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.980\nSo if I wanna just send communications\nto everyone on that subnet,\n\n157\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.480\nI would just take that last address,\nand specify for\n\n158\n00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.130\nmy destination, so\neverybody would get that message.\n\n159\n00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.640\nWe don't have that in IPv6.\n\n160\n00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:34.130\nSo you really have to think about that,\nbecause a lot of different protocols and\n\n161\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.660\ntechnologies that we utilize,\nleverage Broadcast communications.\n\n162\n00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.550\nSo that's why you'll see\ndifferent components.\n\n163\n00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.620\nLike we don't see ARP being\nused in IP version 6,\n\n164\n00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.610\nand different things like ICMP\nworks a little bit differently.\n\n165\n00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.900\nWe've got DHCP version 6 as well.\n\n166\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.704\nSo just knowing that,\nis going to be big for you here.\n\n167\n00:09:55.704 --> 00:10:00.010\nNow, Anycast is going to be, it's not new.\n\n168\n00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.026\nYou can utilize Anycast in IP version 4,\n\n169\n00:10:03.026 --> 00:10:07.247\nbut in lieu of Broadcast,\nwe're gonna be seeing, well,\n\n170\n00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:12.264\na lot more multicast messages being\ntransmitted with IP version 6.\n\n171\n00:10:12.264 --> 00:10:17.057\nBut we also have Anycast traffic\nthat identifies multiple interfaces,\n\n172\n00:10:17.057 --> 00:10:19.090\non one or more hosts.\n\n173\n00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.850\nAnd it's kind of cool if you think\nabout it, because you can have multiple\n\n174\n00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.000\npaths to go ahead and\ntransmit that information.\n\n175\n00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.670\nSo I'm basically gonna be transmitting\nto my nearest neighbor, so right now,\n\n176\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.060\nMike, you're the closest person to me.\n\n177\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:40.420\nBut we're talking geographical,\nphysical distance here.\n\n178\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:46.133\nSo we just have to keep in mind that\nthey're talking about our routing matrix,\n\n179\n00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:50.304\nwhen we talk about closest neighbor there,\nso to speak.\n\n180\n00:10:50.304 --> 00:10:53.520\nAnd you know what,\nlet me pull up another document.\n\n181\n00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.365\nI wanna show you some more\nof these prefixes here.\n\n182\n00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:01.097\nSo I'm going to attach this to the show\nnotes as well, so you have that,\n\n183\n00:11:01.097 --> 00:11:04.380\nand get familiar with\nthe way things look here.\n\n184\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.000\nI'll show these to you, and\nI think it might make a little more sense,\n\n185\n00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.460\nas we dig a little deeper in\nthat actual composition as well.\n\n186\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.020\nBut just as we saw with\nthe network portion\n\n187\n00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.310\nof our IP version 4 addresses,\nit'll give us a clue,\n\n188\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.200\nsome information about hey,\nwhere should I go ahead and send this?\n\n189\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.840\nWhat kind of message is\nthis being used for?\n\n190\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.379\nAnd router advertisements are integrated,\nright from the onset,\n\n191\n00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:32.376\ndesigned into IP version 6.\n\n192\n00:11:32.376 --> 00:11:37.116\nSo what that does for us, like Mike\nhad alluded to before, you said hey,\n\n193\n00:11:37.116 --> 00:11:40.149\nIPv6, you shouldn't be intimidated by it,\n\n194\n00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:44.141\nbecause it's actually not as much work for\nus to configure.\n\n195\n00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:44.721\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n196\n00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:46.172\n&gt;&gt; So that's what those router\n\n197\n00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.930\nadvertisements are doing for us.\n\n198\n00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.420\nThey're helping really make\nit a little easier for\n\n199\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.570\nus in that type of communication.\n\n200\n00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.130\nAnd so I'll just go ahead, and\n\n201\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:59.020\nwe're gonna be looking at some a these\ntechnologies a little bit later.\n\n202\n00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.850\nWe'll talk about those transitional\ntechnologies, like 6to4, Teredo,\n\n203\n00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.800\nand ISATAP as well.\n\n204\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.550\nBut I just wanted to throw\nsome of these out here,\n\n205\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:14.390\nlike looking at that fe to specify\nhere for that deprecated site local.\n\n206\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:19.260\nJust know that they do exist, but\nyou just wanna be aware of that.\n\n207\n00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.848\nAll right, what else do we got here?\n\n208\n00:12:21.848 --> 00:12:24.372\nIP version 6, what does it look like?\n\n209\n00:12:24.372 --> 00:12:27.785\nLet me zoom out, because we had\nzoomed in to read everything before.\n\n210\n00:12:27.785 --> 00:12:29.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actually,\n\n211\n00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:33.670\nthis top bar is pretty microscopic,\nit's so tiny.\n\n212\n00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.380\nThe reason I had to,\nhere let me go to my actual size here.\n\n213\n00:12:39.573 --> 00:12:45.370\nThe reason I had to do that, is because\nthat's a lot of typing there, Mike, right?\n\n214\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.358\nAnd if we look at this,\nthis is going to be our full 128 bits.\n\n215\n00:12:49.358 --> 00:12:50.627\nI mean go ahead and count them.\n\n216\n00:12:50.627 --> 00:12:51.607\nIf you want, they're there.\n\n217\n00:12:51.607 --> 00:12:56.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the way that we kind of break it\n\n218\n00:12:56.347 --> 00:13:00.750\nup is in IPv4, we had four octets.\n\n219\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:06.010\nWell, here we have, actually,\nwe have sections of 16 instead of 8.\n\n220\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.780\nSo we are kind of grouping\nthem a little bit differently.\n\n221\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.171\nAnd we're gonna take both.\n\n222\n00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:17.210\nWe're gonna take the 128, and we're gonna\ngo ahead and crack it in half here.\n\n223\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.660\nSo the first half is going to\nbe referencing my prefix, and\n\n224\n00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.540\nthen the second half is gonna to be\nreferencing that interface ID there.\n\n225\n00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.370\nSo just kind of showing\nyou what that looks like.\n\n226\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.040\nNow, we talked about\nsubnetting with IP version 4.\n\n227\n00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.240\nAnd subnetting is possible\nwith IP version 6 as well.\n\n228\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.400\nIs it required?\n\n229\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:49.408\nProbably not, in most Local Area Network\nadministration capacities, why?\n\n230\n00:13:49.408 --> 00:13:51.527\nWell-\n&gt;&gt; Definitely not doing for\n\n231\n00:13:51.527 --> 00:13:54.396\nthe number of nodes on a possible network,\nright?\n\n232\n00:13:54.396 --> 00:13:57.400\nBecause we got 64 bits in this case.\n\n233\n00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.730\nSo lots of nodes can fit, but [INAUDIBLE]\nmy subnet for, still my subnet for\n\n234\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.310\nsecurity reasons, segregating out certain\ntypes of traffic maybe, things like that?\n\n235\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can definitely do that.\n\n236\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.910\nIt’s not something that you’re gonna see.\n\n237\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.712\nAnd I deftly don’t think they’re gonna ask\nyou to perform subnetting on the exam for\n\n238\n00:14:13.712 --> 00:14:14.600\nIP version 6.\n\n239\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.799\nThe last 16 bits of the prefix,\nand that would actually be like\n\n240\n00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:25.889\nthis section right here, I just wrote\nit in hexadecimal for this example.\n\n241\n00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.140\nThat's where that sub netting would occur,\nis right there.\n\n242\n00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.710\nYou could modify those bits.\n\n243\n00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.760\nAnd it's kind of interesting,\nso they always recommend to\n\n244\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.330\nuse something that's called\na natural nibble boundary.\n\n245\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:45.310\nAnd if you think about it,\na nibble is 4 bits, so half of a byte.\n\n246\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:51.069\nAnd if you look at the way that\nthe slash notations are ordered here,\n\n247\n00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:53.908\nwe are going in increments of 4.\n\n248\n00:14:53.908 --> 00:14:59.040\nSo 4 is the magic number when you're\nsubnetting with IP version 6.\n\n249\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.740\nAll right, now,\n\n250\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:08.560\nyou might have noticed that I didn't\ntype this particular string here twice.\n\n251\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.070\nI said hey,\nI changed this to hexadecimal notation.\n\n252\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.240\nThe reason I did that was,\nwell, because I'm lazy.\n\n253\n00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.374\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n254\n00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:18.060\n&gt;&gt; True story.\n\n255\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.097\nAnd if you think about that,\nwe have the ability to take something.\n\n256\n00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:28.900\nHumans, we go with decimal,\nthat's gonna be 10 base numbering system.\n\n257\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.820\nYou know computers are going to be binary.\n\n258\n00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.562\nWhat we see on this first line,\n2 base numbering system.\n\n259\n00:15:33.562 --> 00:15:36.609\nBut when we're dealing with hexadecimal,\n\n260\n00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:41.071\nthat's going to be our 16 base,\nand we see, gee, what is it?\n\n261\n00:15:41.071 --> 00:15:45.406\n0 to 9, and then up to F there,\nfor those 16 components.\n\n262\n00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:50.018\nAnd sometimes I've even\ngiven students spreadsheets,\n\n263\n00:15:50.018 --> 00:15:55.110\nlike an Excel spreadsheet to help\nthem with the conversions for\n\n264\n00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.622\nsubnetting for IP version 4.\n\n265\n00:15:57.622 --> 00:16:02.146\nHowever, finding a spreadsheet\nthat is capable of retaining\n\n266\n00:16:02.146 --> 00:16:04.502\nthe amount of fields for IPv6.\n\n267\n00:16:04.502 --> 00:16:06.444\nWell, yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n268\n00:16:06.444 --> 00:16:07.130\n&gt;&gt; Good luck with that.\n\n269\n00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.250\nAnd also, Excel is gonna be\nlooking at those characters and\n\n270\n00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:15.580\nnot really seeing that hexadecimal and\nunderstanding it fully there.\n\n271\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.770\nSo I just kind of wanted\nto throw that out as well.\n\n272\n00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.094\nYou can utilize hexadecimal\nto help shorten that length.\n\n273\n00:16:22.094 --> 00:16:26.290\nBut here I have that same address.\n\n274\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.730\nI believe it's the same one\ncuz I just copied and paste.\n\n275\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.310\nSee, I told you.\n\n276\n00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.429\nI really am lazy here.\n\n277\n00:16:30.429 --> 00:16:33.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But what I have here in this\n\n278\n00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.780\nparticular address right here,\nit's the same one, right?\n\n279\n00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.274\nAnd I wanna talk about how\nwe can even become lazier.\n\n280\n00:16:40.274 --> 00:16:42.405\nWell, I guess it's really not lazy but\n\n281\n00:16:42.405 --> 00:16:44.440\nit's just-\n&gt;&gt; Efficient.\n\n282\n00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.975\n&gt;&gt; Efficient.\nThere we go, I like that.\n\n283\n00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:46.544\n&gt;&gt; Efficient.\n\n284\n00:16:46.544 --> 00:16:50.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the first step that\nwe could do is something called\n\n285\n00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.000\nremoving the leading zeroes.\n\n286\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.081\nSo here you can see I've highlighted,\nif I can talk, leading zeros here.\n\n287\n00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:01.370\nAnd it's pretty self explanatory.\n\n288\n00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:06.830\nThese zeros are leading that six and\nthe three there written in hexadecimal.\n\n289\n00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.640\nSo what I can do is I\ncan just take them out.\n\n290\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.840\nI can remove them.\n\n291\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.599\nSo if I were to go ahead and rewrite that,\n\n292\n00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:17.100\nit would look just like\nthis minus those two zeros.\n\n293\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:22.555\n&gt;&gt; Because their systems know that every\nblock should have four hexadecimal digits.\n\n294\n00:17:22.555 --> 00:17:24.808\nSo if we only see two digits in there,\n\n295\n00:17:24.808 --> 00:17:28.603\nit's gonna assume that there\nwere two zeros in front of that.\n\n296\n00:17:28.603 --> 00:17:32.060\nIf it only sees one digit,\nit knows to put three zeros back in there.\n\n297\n00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.090\nIf it sees three digits,\nit knows that one zero is missing.\n\n298\n00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.809\nSo it knows how many should be there and\n\n299\n00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:38.808\nit just fills the bag in which is good for\nus.\n\n300\n00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Great for us, yeah.\n\n301\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.660\nSo actually, Mike, before the show,\nwe were talking about looking\n\n302\n00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.100\nat certain types of DNS records\nespecially for those reverse records.\n\n303\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.094\nIt doesn't always do that for\nus, doesn't it?\n\n304\n00:17:51.094 --> 00:17:51.823\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't.\n\n305\n00:17:51.823 --> 00:17:52.775\nNot always.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:17:52.775 --> 00:17:54.063\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:17:54.063 --> 00:17:54.895\n&gt;&gt; And that's when I walk away.\n\n308\n00:17:54.895 --> 00:18:00.439\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But anyways, so\nthe next step that we can do to compress\n\n309\n00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:06.311\nthe address even more would be to\nremove any kind of contiguous or\n\n310\n00:18:06.311 --> 00:18:12.095\ntouching sections of zeros here,\nwhich I have one right here.\n\n311\n00:18:12.095 --> 00:18:13.540\nJust two sections of zero.\n\n312\n00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.840\nSo it could be two or more sections there.\n\n313\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.527\nAnd what I can do is replace that.\n\n314\n00:18:19.527 --> 00:18:21.970\nLet me zoom in so you guys can see this.\n\n315\n00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.392\nRight here,\nI replaced it with double colons.\n\n316\n00:18:25.392 --> 00:18:30.190\nSo, again, like Mike said, the operating\nsystem is able to identify and\n\n317\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.930\nkind of reading between the line.\n\n318\n00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.760\nSo to speak there and say, hey.\n\n319\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.420\nI know that those should be zeros there.\n\n320\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.930\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it knows there should be eight\ntotal blocks, and it only sees,\n\n321\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.112\nin our case, six.\n\n322\n00:18:43.112 --> 00:18:44.820\nSo wherever it sees that colon, colon,\n\n323\n00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.100\nit says, there must have been two blocks\nof zeros here that they left out.\n\n324\n00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.864\nI'll put them back in-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n325\n00:18:50.864 --> 00:18:53.650\nit's kind of funny how\nthe operating system is so smart.\n\n326\n00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.630\nBut there is one exclusion to that.\n\n327\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.360\nIf I were to go ahead and say,\nI'm just changing it up here, and\n\n328\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.490\nlet's say that I had two\nsections with zeroes here.\n\n329\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.720\nI could only do this once.\n\n330\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.540\nYou can't do it more than once.\n\n331\n00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.548\nYou can't make that exception, yeah.\n\n332\n00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:11.150\n&gt;&gt; Because that's a little too much.\n\n333\n00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.023\nRight now, if we say,\nlook there are four blocks left.\n\n334\n00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:17.055\nSo that means there\nare four blocks missing,\n\n335\n00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:19.041\nit has no where to put\nthose missing blocks.\n\n336\n00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:21.728\nAnd if there is two places\nto put the missing blocks,\n\n337\n00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:24.590\ndo three blocks go here and\none block goes here?\n\n338\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.190\nOr do we use the two in two,\nor is it three in one.\n\n339\n00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.110\nIt doesn't know were to put the zero,\nthis is what we call ambiguous.\n\n340\n00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.937\nSo because it's ambiguous,\nit says no you can't do that.\n\n341\n00:19:33.937 --> 00:19:37.398\nSo you can only do the zero\ncompression once in an IPv6 address.\n\n342\n00:19:37.398 --> 00:19:39.307\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n343\n00:19:39.307 --> 00:19:42.072\nI was gonna fix that and put it back,\nbut I'm like yeah, it's okay.\n\n344\n00:19:42.072 --> 00:19:43.787\nYou guys, yeah, you will remember.\n\n345\n00:19:43.787 --> 00:19:48.259\n&gt;&gt; You might be thinking like you could\ndo those other zeros right there.\n\n346\n00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:52.147\nYou could do a colon colon for that, but\nyou can't because you've already used that\n\n347\n00:19:52.147 --> 00:19:54.740\nzero Compression somewhere\nelse in the IPv6 address.\n\n348\n00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you know what?\n\n349\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.730\nI am just gonna go ahead and\nchange this back.\n\n350\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.360\nJust in case any of you\nguys are taking notes,\n\n351\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.368\nI don't want to make that confusing.\n\n352\n00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.980\nAll right, [LAUGH] I don't know, anyways.\n\n353\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.890\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n354\n00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so yes.\n\n355\n00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.310\nSo like Mike said,\nwe've put those two there.\n\n356\n00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.922\nAnd also I wanted to separate this out and\nshow you.\n\n357\n00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:18.815\nSo once I understand these rules, I really\ncould have done it all in one step.\n\n358\n00:20:18.815 --> 00:20:22.473\nYou don't have to break it down like this,\nbut for instance this once section where\n\n359\n00:20:22.473 --> 00:20:25.519\nthere were all those zeroes,\nyou could change that to just one zero.\n\n360\n00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:29.239\nCuz you could remove the leading zeroes,\nthose three in the front and\n\n361\n00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:32.659\njust have that one as like a retainer\nlike a place holder there.\n\n362\n00:20:32.659 --> 00:20:34.920\nSo we're not confusing\nthe operating system.\n\n363\n00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.100\nSo you don't have to do it in this order.\n\n364\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.840\nI just wanted to show you\nkind of what that looks like.\n\n365\n00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.790\n&gt;&gt; And in the end, though, if you compare\nthe first IPv6 address and the very last\n\n366\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.380\none, which are the same addresses,\nI'd much rather type that bottom one.\n\n367\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.326\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; Than to fill in a static address\n\n368\n00:20:48.326 --> 00:20:51.600\nsomewhere or\nif I was trying to ping something.\n\n369\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.430\nThe bottom one is gonna be a lot\neasier to type than that top one.\n\n370\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.890\n&gt;&gt; Well, even if we look at.\n\n371\n00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.510\nHold on, let me see here.\n\n372\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.190\nLet's go back to our actual size here.\n\n373\n00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.460\nComparing these two, right, Mike?\n\n374\n00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.039\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n375\n00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:03.539\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n376\n00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:04.173\n&gt;&gt; Cuz, yeah,\n\n377\n00:21:04.173 --> 00:21:06.280\nif you wanna write it out in binary-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n378\n00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:06.898\n&gt;&gt; Be my guest, but-\n\n379\n00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:07.523\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n380\n00:21:07.523 --> 00:21:08.867\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you have a good counter\n\n381\n00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:11.701\nsystem.\n[LAUGH] You've got 120 of them to\n\n382\n00:21:11.701 --> 00:21:12.450\ngo.\n[LAUGH]\n\n383\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.910\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n384\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:20.160\nPrefixes, like I said, that's going to be\njust like pre, before, prior, or not prior\n\n385\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.295\nexcuse me, but yeah, pre meaning ahead of-\n&gt;&gt; In front of.\n\n386\n00:21:23.295 --> 00:21:24.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in front of.\n\n387\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.540\nOkay, makes sense, right?\n\n388\n00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:31.530\nSo for the prefix, we saw some of\nthose prefix policies I showed you.\n\n389\n00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.830\nKnowing those are going to be key.\n\n390\n00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.730\nAnd just looking at the prefixes there.\n\n391\n00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.800\n&gt;&gt; Being able to recognize this\nis a link local address, or\n\n392\n00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.880\nthis is a globally routable address,\nI think is important.\n\n393\n00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.349\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so looking at the second\nportion there for the interface ID.\n\n394\n00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:53.424\nThis is also important in the way\nthat Mike was talking about\n\n395\n00:21:53.424 --> 00:21:58.104\nhaving a lot of automation\nhappening here with IPv6.\n\n396\n00:21:58.104 --> 00:22:01.447\nYou don't always have\nto have the automation.\n\n397\n00:22:01.447 --> 00:22:05.670\nYou can manually configure it just\nlike we can with our IPv4 addresses.\n\n398\n00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:12.406\nBut we do see components such as EUI64 and\nstateless autoconfiguration.\n\n399\n00:22:12.406 --> 00:22:21.060\nWe have different ways like with a DHCPv6\nthat can automatically assign these.\n\n400\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.700\nAnd we really don't have to do anything.\n\n401\n00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.750\n&gt;&gt; That's one of the best things.\n\n402\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:28.520\nThat's why i said earlier,\nonce you learn IPv6 and you realize you\n\n403\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.350\ndon't have to do that much,\nbecause it's one of the coolest things.\n\n404\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.450\nA node can generate its\nown globally unique IPv6\n\n405\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:41.053\naddress without any help from us, right?\n\n406\n00:22:41.053 --> 00:22:44.341\nWe give it the company prefix,\nit can generate the last 64,\n\n407\n00:22:44.341 --> 00:22:45.550\nand we're good to go.\n\n408\n00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.125\nIt's similar to what APIPA does, right,\nwhere it hollows out to say, hey,\n\n409\n00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:51.100\nis anybody else using this?\n\n410\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.870\nLast octet, no,\nthen I'll go ahead and use that.\n\n411\n00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.731\nBut with IPv6,\nwe're talking about 64 bits.\n\n412\n00:22:55.731 --> 00:22:58.695\nAnd I think the method you're looking at,\nCherokee,\n\n413\n00:22:58.695 --> 00:23:02.510\nthere is how a node goes about\ngenerating that unique number, right?\n\n414\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwith different options that we have.\n\n415\n00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.588\nAnd I'll come back to\nthat APIPA there just to,\n\n416\n00:23:06.588 --> 00:23:08.066\nthat reminded me-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n417\n00:23:08.066 --> 00:23:09.280\n&gt;&gt; When you said that there.\n\n418\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.837\nBut while I'm here talking about\nthese different interface ID options,\n\n419\n00:23:14.837 --> 00:23:18.956\nI wanted to spend a little extra\ntime on something called the EUI64.\n\n420\n00:23:18.956 --> 00:23:24.894\nAnd that's gonna stand for\nextended unique identifier.\n\n421\n00:23:24.894 --> 00:23:30.682\nAnd if we think about\nhaving a unique address.\n\n422\n00:23:30.682 --> 00:23:34.923\nAnd a unique address in hexadecimal\nnotation because we just saw how we can go\n\n423\n00:23:34.923 --> 00:23:37.850\nahead and\nshorten that into hexadecimal notation.\n\n424\n00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:42.851\nSo if I could find a hexadecimal\nnumber that was unique to a machine,\n\n425\n00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:44.445\nthat would be great.\n\n426\n00:23:44.445 --> 00:23:45.126\nWouldn't it?\n\n427\n00:23:45.126 --> 00:23:49.555\n&gt;&gt; If we only had something\nlike a Mac address, maybe?\n\n428\n00:23:49.555 --> 00:23:52.206\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, we do.\n\n429\n00:23:52.206 --> 00:23:52.883\nAnd that's right here.\n\n430\n00:23:52.883 --> 00:23:57.547\nThis is gonna be our media access control,\nour burned in address.\n\n431\n00:23:57.547 --> 00:23:59.354\nI'm sure you're familiar with it by now.\n\n432\n00:23:59.354 --> 00:24:04.924\nIf not Yes, then you definitely need\nto know that for this particular exam,\n\n433\n00:24:04.924 --> 00:24:09.111\njust knowing that it is that\n48 bit composition there.\n\n434\n00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:14.692\nAnd again, we can see the first portion of\nour MAC addresses being used for the OUI,\n\n435\n00:24:14.692 --> 00:24:20.041\nthat organizationally unique identifier,\nwhich is specifying that vendor or\n\n436\n00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:23.747\nmanufacturer for\nwhatever particular device there.\n\n437\n00:24:23.747 --> 00:24:27.278\nAnd then that second half is\ngonna be NIC specific, or\n\n438\n00:24:27.278 --> 00:24:29.870\nspecific to that individual machine.\n\n439\n00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.464\nHopefully you don't get any\nkind of cheap equipment\n\n440\n00:24:34.464 --> 00:24:37.115\n[LAUGH] that may have-\n&gt;&gt; We do learn that those are supposed to\n\n441\n00:24:37.115 --> 00:24:37.922\nbe globally unique.\n\n442\n00:24:37.922 --> 00:24:44.260\nThere have been a few scenarios where\nsomebody gets a lot of, like 1,000 NICs.\n\n443\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.550\nAnd a couple of them have\na duplicate MAC address.\n\n444\n00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.960\nBut for the most part, we can assume\nthat those are going to be unique.\n\n445\n00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so then we can take our\nMAC address for that machine.\n\n446\n00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.654\nAnd what we're gonna do is, if you look\nat that division there, the pink and\n\n447\n00:24:58.654 --> 00:25:01.159\nthe yellow, and\nI'm cracking it in half there.\n\n448\n00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:05.194\nI'm going to go ahead and insert FFFE,\n\n449\n00:25:05.194 --> 00:25:09.963\nwhich are going to be, again, hexadecimal,\n\n450\n00:25:09.963 --> 00:25:14.530\nand so\nthat is really how you get your EUI.\n\n451\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:19.070\nThere is another change there,\nif I were to go ahead and\n\n452\n00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:25.060\nwrite my EUI in binary, the seventh bit.\n\n453\n00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.800\nSo I'm just giving an example with dashes,\nbut remember, in hexadecimal,\n\n454\n00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.670\nyou could also use colons\nthere to differentiate.\n\n455\n00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.150\nBut if I were to write it out in binary,\n\n456\n00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.210\nthat seventh bit would be inversed or\nflipped.\n\n457\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.970\nSo if it were a 0, it would then be a 1,\nor if it was a 1, it would then be a 0.\n\n458\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.920\nSo that's also one more thing\nthat changes, to go ahead and\n\n459\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.875\ncreate that unique identifier there.\n\n460\n00:25:46.875 --> 00:25:49.108\nSo I just want to throw it out there,\n\n461\n00:25:49.108 --> 00:25:52.380\nbecause that might be\nsomething good to know.\n\n462\n00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.870\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's fascinating to me,\n\n463\n00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.520\nthe way these nodes can come up with\ntheir own global unique address.\n\n464\n00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.400\nBut now you see how they do it,\nit's really not magic, right?\n\n465\n00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.680\nThey've already got a unique number\nassociated with their network adapter.\n\n466\n00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.980\nEven if they have two or\nthree or four network adapters,\n\n467\n00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.230\neach one of those network adapters\nhas its own unique MAC address.\n\n468\n00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.600\nSo they've got built in\nuniqueness right there,\n\n469\n00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.650\nit's just a little bit\nshort of what we need.\n\n470\n00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:18.560\nThe interface ID on an IPv6 address is\n64 bits, whereas a MAC is only 48, so\n\n471\n00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.050\nwhat do we do?\n\n472\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.330\nWe pad it a little bit,\nright, we throw in that FFFE,\n\n473\n00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:30.913\nwhich is 1111 1111 11111110,\nI think, don't test me on that.\n\n474\n00:26:30.913 --> 00:26:33.804\nBut then we throw eight more bits\nthere right in the middle of it, and\n\n475\n00:26:33.804 --> 00:26:34.935\nnow we've got 64 bits.\n\n476\n00:26:34.935 --> 00:26:38.885\nThat's unique, and\nnicely fits into our IPv6 address, so\n\n477\n00:26:38.885 --> 00:26:41.989\nit's a really cool system,\nwell thought out.\n\n478\n00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:47.376\n&gt;&gt; It is cool, yeah, and Mike,\nyou mentioned the APIPA earlier.\n\n479\n00:26:47.376 --> 00:26:50.750\nSo I just kind of wanted to talk\nabout what kind of addresses we may\n\n480\n00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.820\nsee when we're dealing with\nour IP version 6 addresses.\n\n481\n00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.593\nSo something that would be\ncomparable to an APIPA address, and\n\n482\n00:26:58.593 --> 00:27:02.566\nif we think about how and\nwhy we get APIPA addresses.\n\n483\n00:27:02.566 --> 00:27:07.622\nWe don't have a legitimate address to\nbe routed on my local area network.\n\n484\n00:27:07.622 --> 00:27:11.373\nIt's like that failsafe mechanism\nthat Windows will provide for us,\n\n485\n00:27:11.373 --> 00:27:14.120\nis that APIPA address,\nautomatic IP addressing.\n\n486\n00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.473\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, if you've configured\na node to be a DHCP client,\n\n487\n00:27:17.473 --> 00:27:21.573\nthat means he's getting his TCP/IP\nconfiguration from a DHCP server.\n\n488\n00:27:21.573 --> 00:27:26.062\nIf he hollers out on the network and DHCP\ndoesn't respond, what's he supposed to do?\n\n489\n00:27:26.062 --> 00:27:29.610\nWell, APIPA is a way that he can\nat least generate something, and\n\n490\n00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:34.580\nhave a valid, unique network address,\nalthough it won't get him too far.\n\n491\n00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:39.252\nIPv6 has something similar to that,\na unique self-generated IP address?\n\n492\n00:27:39.252 --> 00:27:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Link local address is what\nwe're gonna see for that one.\n\n493\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.620\nBut the thing is,\n\n494\n00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:47.850\nwe only get those APIPA addresses is\nin a moment of need with IP version 4.\n\n495\n00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:53.123\nWith IP version 6, we always have them,\nso that's the difference there.\n\n496\n00:27:53.123 --> 00:27:56.867\n&gt;&gt; It's, what is it, FE80,\nright, is the prefix?\n\n497\n00:27:56.867 --> 00:28:01.165\n&gt;&gt; Yes, FE80, to go ahead and specify for\nthat prefix, which is good to know.\n\n498\n00:28:01.165 --> 00:28:05.857\n&gt;&gt; Again, a really cool concept, right,\nwith IPv6, cuz your nodes will actually\n\n499\n00:28:05.857 --> 00:28:09.612\nuse that link local address to\ncommunicate locally on that link.\n\n500\n00:28:09.612 --> 00:28:13.847\nLink, subnet, right, no routing,\ncuz FE80 addresses are non-routeable.\n\n501\n00:28:13.847 --> 00:28:14.743\n&gt;&gt; Non-routeable.\n\n502\n00:28:14.743 --> 00:28:17.975\n&gt;&gt; Just like APIPA, so\nthat they can't be routed.\n\n503\n00:28:17.975 --> 00:28:23.698\nBut now, each machine has it's own\nunique IPv6 address on the network.\n\n504\n00:28:23.698 --> 00:28:26.760\nAnd it can at least communicate\nwith other nodes on that subnet.\n\n505\n00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes, but if we wanna talk about\ncommunicating outside of that subnet,\n\n506\n00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.710\nthen we look at something like\nour global unicast address.\n\n507\n00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.770\nSo if we think about that, and\nthink of the term globally,\n\n508\n00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.300\nyou always wanna be global unique,\nand that's the way I think about it.\n\n509\n00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.171\nSo for global unicast address,\nwe're able to go ahead and\n\n510\n00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:50.371\ntraverse those routers, and\ncommunicate externally there.\n\n511\n00:28:50.371 --> 00:28:55.184\nBut we do have a link local address,\nwhich is specifying a private IP\n\n512\n00:28:55.184 --> 00:29:00.348\nversion 4 address there, and\nI'm trying to think special addresses.\n\n513\n00:29:00.348 --> 00:29:04.999\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so those unique locals, right,\nthey're actually routable internally, but\n\n514\n00:29:04.999 --> 00:29:06.810\nnot outside our network.\n\n515\n00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.930\nSo I can route it between subnets, but\nborder routers are gonna drop them.\n\n516\n00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:14.690\nSo link local, not routeable at all,\nunique local, routeable internally but\n\n517\n00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.518\nnot routeable out to the Internet.\n\n518\n00:29:16.518 --> 00:29:19.898\nAnd then global unique,\nbecause they're globally unique,\n\n519\n00:29:19.898 --> 00:29:24.583\nthey can go anywhere in the world, they\nare routeable, they are guaranteed unique.\n\n520\n00:29:24.583 --> 00:29:29.620\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and then what if we\nhave those little fringe addresses?\n\n521\n00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:35.276\nThings like loopback,\nwhere we had IP version 4,\n\n522\n00:29:35.276 --> 00:29:40.620\nour 127.0.0.1, in IPv4, it's just\na bunch of 0s with a 1 at the very end.\n\n523\n00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.234\nBut remember our rule,\nwhenever we're compressing, we can just,\n\n524\n00:29:44.234 --> 00:29:48.617\nsince those 0s are all contiguous, then\nwe can just use colon colon with a 1, so-\n\n525\n00:29:48.617 --> 00:29:50.953\n&gt;&gt; I don't have to write 127 0s-\n\n526\n00:29:50.953 --> 00:29:51.486\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n\n527\n00:29:51.486 --> 00:29:55.952\n&gt;&gt; Then a 1, I can just do colon colon 1,\nand it knows, right?\n\n528\n00:29:55.952 --> 00:30:01.897\nSo that's even easier than 127.0.0.1,\nsee how much easier IPv6 is?\n\n529\n00:30:01.897 --> 00:30:06.373\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know what,\nthis is also really easy in IP version 4.\n\n530\n00:30:06.373 --> 00:30:10.201\nIf you have an IP address of all 0s,\nthen you really don't have an IP address,\n\n531\n00:30:10.201 --> 00:30:11.659\nright, it's unspecified.\n\n532\n00:30:11.659 --> 00:30:15.684\n&gt;&gt; If we have an unspecified,\nwe'll typically write 0.0.0.0 for\n\n533\n00:30:15.684 --> 00:30:18.377\nunknown, what does IPv6 do for\nunspecified?\n\n534\n00:30:18.377 --> 00:30:20.190\n&gt;&gt; Zero, all zeros again.\n\n535\n00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.895\n&gt;&gt; All zeros?\n\n536\n00:30:20.895 --> 00:30:23.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you can just use colon colon.\n\n537\n00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:23.968\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n538\n00:30:23.968 --> 00:30:24.959\n&gt;&gt; I don't even need the 1,\n\n539\n00:30:24.959 --> 00:30:26.409\nit's even shorter than my loopback.\n\n540\n00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:31.000\nSo aren't you dying to switch\nto IPv6 after all of this?\n\n541\n00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000\n&gt;&gt; We do have a couple other\nthings to think about,\n\n542\n00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.900\nthat there are states for our addresses.\n\n543\n00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.177\nSo remember how we said that\nthe systems are gonna be checking for\n\n544\n00:30:39.177 --> 00:30:41.247\nus to perform that auto configuration.\n\n545\n00:30:41.247 --> 00:30:48.159\nAnd we could use different\nthings like Slack or our EUI 64.\n\n546\n00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:53.025\nBut how, I'm trying to think, how long\ndoes it take for all this to happen?\n\n547\n00:30:53.025 --> 00:30:55.685\nWell, there may be a little\nbit of a transition for\n\n548\n00:30:55.685 --> 00:30:57.785\nthe state of that IP address.\n\n549\n00:30:57.785 --> 00:31:00.475\nSo there's one called tentative state, so\n\n550\n00:31:00.475 --> 00:31:05.272\nwhile the system is checking to make sure\nthat that is in fact a unique address,\n\n551\n00:31:05.272 --> 00:31:08.269\nyou may see that state\nbeing noted as tentative.\n\n552\n00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:12.504\nYou have valid, valid means I've\nalready verified that it's unique, so\n\n553\n00:31:12.504 --> 00:31:14.060\nthis is a valid IP address.\n\n554\n00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.050\nJust kind of like what we would see\nin IP version 4, it makes sense,\n\n555\n00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.830\nright, having it valid.\n\n556\n00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:23.970\nAnd preferred means if I had a preference,\nlike if I were to go ahead and manually or\n\n557\n00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:28.440\nstatically set an IP address there,\njust like we see in IP version 4.\n\n558\n00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.630\nThere's also deprecated,\nthe address is valid, but\n\n559\n00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:35.310\nit's discouraged for\nany kind of continued use there.\n\n560\n00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:39.580\nAnd then lastly invalid, the address\nno longer allows a node to send or\n\n561\n00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.590\nreceive that unicast traffic.\n\n562\n00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.977\nSo just knowing those different states\nalso, so we can see that there are a lot\n\n563\n00:31:45.977 --> 00:31:49.570\nof similarities between IP version\n4 as well as IP version 6.\n\n564\n00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.153\nBut let's just go ahead and\nlook at some differences real quick.\n\n565\n00:31:53.153 --> 00:31:57.017\nIf I can go full screen for a moment,\nthis is really important, guys.\n\n566\n00:31:57.017 --> 00:31:58.670\nFirst thing on the list,\n\n567\n00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:03.490\nIPv4 fragmentation is performed by\nboth routers and the sending host.\n\n568\n00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.720\nWhat does that mean?\n\n569\n00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.504\nWell, if you think about your MTUs,\nyour maximum transmission units,\n\n570\n00:32:08.504 --> 00:32:10.935\nyou can go ahead and\nmodify them accordingly.\n\n571\n00:32:10.935 --> 00:32:13.740\nWith IPv6, we cannot fragment.\n\n572\n00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:19.880\nSo what that means is our routers,\nour devices that are routing our packets,\n\n573\n00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:26.580\nhave to have a high enough MTU to allow\nthose packets to go through them.\n\n574\n00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.460\nWhat happens if the MTU is lower\nthan the size of the packet?\n\n575\n00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.135\nWell just like with ICMPv4,\nwe'll get a notification,\n\n576\n00:32:35.135 --> 00:32:39.414\na message, saying hey there was\na problem with your transmission.\n\n577\n00:32:39.414 --> 00:32:42.410\nLike when we used PING,\nwe can check on that and so forth.\n\n578\n00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:46.610\nWell for whatever reason, if you\nfeel like hey I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n579\n00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:50.290\ndisable ICMPv6,\n\n580\n00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:55.400\nyou'll never get a notification\nthat your packet didn't go\n\n581\n00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.510\nthrough that router if it were\nlarger than the MTU on that router.\n\n582\n00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:03.464\nSo essentially,\nyou'd be breaking everything.\n\n583\n00:33:03.464 --> 00:33:05.930\n&gt;&gt; You're trying to think it can go,\nbut you wouldn't get a reason why.\n\n584\n00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.250\n&gt;&gt; You would never know, yeah.\n\n585\n00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:12.179\nSo you definitely, if you're gonna\nbe utilizing IPv6 make sure that\n\n586\n00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:17.870\nyou still allow that ICMPv6 traffic\nthrough your firewalls as well.\n\n587\n00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.922\nNow, we did kinda touch on this so\nI'll be brief.\n\n588\n00:33:19.922 --> 00:33:27.020\nARP, we see IPv4 can exist in IPv6 because\nof no broadcast transmissions, right?\n\n589\n00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:32.760\nSo here with IPv4, we use iGMP,\ninternet group management protocol.\n\n590\n00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:38.297\nHowever, a newer protocol called the\nMulticast Listener is gonna be used for\n\n591\n00:33:38.297 --> 00:33:42.315\ndiscovery messages with IPv6,\nso there's a change.\n\n592\n00:33:42.315 --> 00:33:46.971\nAnd again, this is the ICMP that\nI was just referencing there.\n\n593\n00:33:46.971 --> 00:33:49.455\nYou do see that there are differences,\n\n594\n00:33:49.455 --> 00:33:54.190\nthere's a version 4 that typically\nyou'll just hear as ICMP.\n\n595\n00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:59.680\nAnd then the ICMPv6 here\nwe're gonna be replacing it,\n\n596\n00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.640\nRouter Solicitation, and\nusing those RAs or Router Advertisements\n\n597\n00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.840\nto allow those routers to identify\nwhere these messages should be sent.\n\n598\n00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:14.780\nAgain, a difference would be a records for\nDNS and\n\n599\n00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.497\nif you wanna learn more about this.\n\n600\n00:34:17.497 --> 00:34:22.749\nThen we can check out the DNS shows for\nthis particular topic,\n\n601\n00:34:22.749 --> 00:34:27.396\nAAAA, and remember that's going to be for\nour IPv6.\n\n602\n00:34:27.396 --> 00:34:29.536\nAnd Mike you did a great\njob explaining that,\n\n603\n00:34:29.536 --> 00:34:32.360\ndo you just wanna say again\nreal quick why that's four As?\n\n604\n00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Because IPv4 address is 32 bits and\n\n605\n00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.270\nour IPv6 address is four\ntimes the size of that,\n\n606\n00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:44.560\nit's 128 bits so we get four A's one for\neach of the 32 bits in there.\n\n607\n00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.470\nYeah it drives me crazy,\nI just wish they would've called it A2.\n\n608\n00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:48.286\nI don't know.\n\n609\n00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:50.718\n[LAUGH] But yeah AAAA is what we get, but\n\n610\n00:34:50.718 --> 00:34:54.760\nit's because it's four times\nlarger than a 32 bit address.\n\n611\n00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:00.165\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so lastly here, also in that DNS\nshow you'll see how the pointer records,\n\n612\n00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:04.780\nremember those are going to be reversed\nfrom what we normally would be\n\n613\n00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.780\nlooking up here,\nthey're written in the inverse as well.\n\n614\n00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.960\nSo it's a little differently there.\n\n615\n00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.202\nAnd this is where Mike and I,\nwe were kind of kidding around.\n\n616\n00:35:14.202 --> 00:35:19.082\nThose IPv6 pointer records there,\nthose resource records,\n\n617\n00:35:19.082 --> 00:35:21.205\nare a slightly different.\n\n618\n00:35:21.205 --> 00:35:24.300\nYou can't use that zero compression,\nit has to be fully extended.\n\n619\n00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.595\nSo lots of typing there to\ncreate those records and\n\n620\n00:35:27.595 --> 00:35:30.860\nthere's just a slight difference in that\ncomposition and then looking at those and\n\n621\n00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.350\nbeing able to identify that.\n\n622\n00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.410\n&gt;&gt; Remember to watch our DNS episode, and\n\n623\n00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:38.420\nthe little check mark that says\nautomatically create ETR record.\n\n624\n00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.455\n&gt;&gt; Yea.\n&gt;&gt; Use that, don't type it in manually.\n\n625\n00:35:40.455 --> 00:35:43.725\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, and then here you must, with\n\n626\n00:35:43.725 --> 00:35:49.910\nIPv4, you must be able to support a 576\nbyte packet but you could also fragment.\n\n627\n00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:55.550\nWhereas, like we've mentioned before,\nwe cannot fragment with IPv6 and\n\n628\n00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.730\nwe must be able to support\na 1,280 byte packet size.\n\n629\n00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:03.200\nSo one thing that's not on here\nthat just came to mind real quick,\n\n630\n00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.100\nI'm sure there are others as well.\n\n631\n00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.510\nThis is just some really glaring ones,\n\n632\n00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:12.891\nbut IPsec is not required for\n\n633\n00:36:12.891 --> 00:36:17.125\nIPv4 but\nit's just built right into IPv6 as well.\n\n634\n00:36:17.125 --> 00:36:19.525\nSo you might want to add\nthat to your notes there.\n\n635\n00:36:21.005 --> 00:36:23.085\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah you know it kinda\ngoes back to what you were talking about,\n\n636\n00:36:23.085 --> 00:36:27.185\nI think you went all the way back to the\nbeginning of the internet with ARPANET and\n\n637\n00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:31.185\nsecurity was not in the forefront\nof things at that time.\n\n638\n00:36:31.185 --> 00:36:35.450\nThey didn't envision what was gonna happen\nwith this, but hindsight is 20,20, right?\n\n639\n00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:39.930\nNow when they go to develop IPv6, we've\nhad all this experience of what we've done\n\n640\n00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:45.370\nwith IPv4 and we've got all these bolt-on\nthings to help protect IPv4 like IPSec.\n\n641\n00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:49.560\nWith IPv6, we can just say, look we're\ngonna include that from the beginning\n\n642\n00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:52.818\nrather than make it a bolt on and it's a-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It's amazing what\n\n643\n00:36:52.818 --> 00:36:53.352\nplanning will do.\n\n644\n00:36:53.352 --> 00:36:54.089\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n645\n00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:55.170\n&gt;&gt; And experience, right?\n\n646\n00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:59.040\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah because how could they really\nplan ahead of time without knowing how\n\n647\n00:36:59.040 --> 00:36:59.760\nthings would take off.\n\n648\n00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.310\nAll right, so\nwhat does that mean to you and\n\n649\n00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:06.050\nhow does that coincide or\nrelate to the operating system?\n\n650\n00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:10.409\nWell let's take a look here at how we\nwould go ahead and configure that,\n\n651\n00:37:10.409 --> 00:37:14.115\nand I started with a server core\nbecause what if we're tasked\n\n652\n00:37:14.115 --> 00:37:17.038\nwith configuring an IP\naddress in server core.\n\n653\n00:37:17.038 --> 00:37:20.090\nWe don't know how,\nmaybe we're familiar within the GUI.\n\n654\n00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.270\nBut there is that menu\ndriven utility here,\n\n655\n00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:28.000\nwhich is gonna be your s-config tool\nwhere you can go ahead and set that.\n\n656\n00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.988\nAnd this is just one of the few\nways you could do that.\n\n657\n00:37:30.988 --> 00:37:34.432\nSo you would look at the corresponding\nnumber here, and which one is this?\n\n658\n00:37:34.432 --> 00:37:36.020\nMike, you probably have\nthis memorized here?\n\n659\n00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.522\n&gt;&gt; Eight.\n&gt;&gt; Eight.\n\n660\n00:37:36.522 --> 00:37:37.022\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n661\n00:37:37.022 --> 00:37:38.264\n&gt;&gt; So you'd go ahead and\n\n662\n00:37:38.264 --> 00:37:41.852\nyou'd type in eight, hit enter,\nand it's going to ask you,\n\n663\n00:37:41.852 --> 00:37:45.716\nwell on this particular machine I\nonly have my one adapter here, so\n\n664\n00:37:45.716 --> 00:37:49.760\nI can see that by my index number and\nI can see my current IP address.\n\n665\n00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.433\nSo I could go ahead and\nchange that if I wanted to.\n\n666\n00:37:53.433 --> 00:37:56.416\nIf I had multiple adapters here,\nyou'd see those index numbers and\n\n667\n00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:59.470\nthis is what you would type in,\nin your little flashing cursor here.\n\n668\n00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.799\nSo I'm just going to type in 10,\nand then hit enter.\n\n669\n00:38:02.799 --> 00:38:07.060\nAnd it would give me the current details\nabout that adapter, and If I wanted to\n\n670\n00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:11.560\ngo ahead and change that, all right,\nyou can also set your DNS servers and\n\n671\n00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.030\nany kind of the core network services\nright here that you can configure.\n\n672\n00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:20.788\nBut to change the actual IP address,\nyou would go ahead and hit one,\n\n673\n00:38:20.788 --> 00:38:22.973\nset network adapter address.\n\n674\n00:38:22.973 --> 00:38:26.601\nAnd then if you wanted to\nchange it to 198.168.0.,\n\n675\n00:38:26.601 --> 00:38:31.120\nI don't know 11 or whatever your-\n&gt;&gt; I think first you gotta\n\n676\n00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.974\ntell it if you want it static or-\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n677\n00:38:35.974 --> 00:38:37.210\nYes, DHCP or static.\n\n678\n00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.107\nGood point, sorry Mike.\n\n679\n00:38:38.107 --> 00:38:38.770\n&gt;&gt; It's okay.\n\n680\n00:38:39.936 --> 00:38:41.020\n&gt;&gt; And that's just to goes,\n\n681\n00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:45.030\nstatic of course being manual always gonna\nhave that preferred address there or\n\n682\n00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:48.800\nshould have that preferred address and\nthen DHCP, if I had that\n\n683\n00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.070\nset up in my network then it would rely\non that DHCP server to obtain that.\n\n684\n00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:57.860\nI'm gonna just back on out of this and hit\nenter cuz it will cancel out of there, and\n\n685\n00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.800\nyou can just go back to four for\nthe main menu there.\n\n686\n00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:06.490\nAnd then 15 to go ahead and\nexit this particular tool.\n\n687\n00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.620\nLet me just clear this screen so\nwe have some room right there.\n\n688\n00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.088\nNow of course we have an old tried and\n\n689\n00:39:13.088 --> 00:39:17.010\ntrue command line utility\nthat we could use, netsh.\n\n690\n00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:21.260\nSo if you wanted to use netsh to change\nan IP address, you could just go ahead and\n\n691\n00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.050\nuse the syntax here.\n\n692\n00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.739\nThis is going to be netsh interface.\n\n693\n00:39:27.573 --> 00:39:28.850\nAnd that is IP set.\n\n694\n00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:33.469\nJust want to make sure I'm\ntyping this right, address name.\n\n695\n00:39:33.469 --> 00:39:34.739\nWhat was the name of my adapter there?\n\n696\n00:39:37.565 --> 00:39:40.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a good one.\n\n697\n00:39:40.522 --> 00:39:41.090\n&gt;&gt; Ethernet?\n\n698\n00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.782\n&gt;&gt; I'm thinking it was ethernet or\nethernet zero.\n\n699\n00:39:43.782 --> 00:39:44.976\n&gt;&gt; On twelve,\nI think they default to ethernet, yeah.\n\n700\n00:39:44.976 --> 00:39:48.377\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you would go ahead and\nput whatever the name of\n\n701\n00:39:48.377 --> 00:39:52.528\nyour adapter was there, like ethernet,\nand then you would specify if If\n\n702\n00:39:52.528 --> 00:39:56.974\nit was something with a space in it you\nwould just use those quotations there.\n\n703\n00:39:56.974 --> 00:40:00.283\nAnd then again like Mike had pointed\nout before if it was static or\n\n704\n00:40:00.283 --> 00:40:02.290\nDHCP you could note that as well.\n\n705\n00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.925\nSo you could say static and then you\nwould just go ahead and put your well,\n\n706\n00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:07.962\npreferred if we wanted to do 11 again.\n\n707\n00:40:07.962 --> 00:40:10.482\nAnd I know I'm kind of\ngoing off the screen, but\n\n708\n00:40:10.482 --> 00:40:13.540\nthat would be the syntax to go ahead and\nset it with netsh.\n\n709\n00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.580\nAll right,\nlet me just type in here since we\n\n710\n00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:25.300\nare in a command prompt and\nour core if I do my PowerShell.\n\n711\n00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.710\nYou can see that now,\nI was in PowerShell actually already.\n\n712\n00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.590\nSorry about that, I didn't notice.\n\n713\n00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.710\nThe PS there is what\nyou will be looking for\n\n714\n00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.770\nand those commands were\nworking in PowerShell.\n\n715\n00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.159\nSo anyway so I guess blue would\nbe a good indication too.\n\n716\n00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:42.296\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes, although I've seen\ns config leave my screen blue-\n\n717\n00:40:42.296 --> 00:40:43.458\n&gt;&gt; Blue, that's what I thought.\n\n718\n00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:45.170\nI was like okay it's just a blue.\n\n719\n00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:49.695\n&gt;&gt; But luckily for us PowerShell has\naliases for most, a good portion of our\n\n720\n00:40:49.695 --> 00:40:53.864\nold CLR command prompt commands,\nso we can still use them for now.\n\n721\n00:40:53.864 --> 00:40:57.927\nBut you really should start moving\naway from them because those are going\n\n722\n00:40:57.927 --> 00:40:59.200\nto disappear one day.\n\n723\n00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.158\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n724\n00:41:00.158 --> 00:41:01.100\n&gt;&gt; Could be ten years from now.\n\n725\n00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.188\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Just like\n\n726\n00:41:02.188 --> 00:41:03.996\nIPv6 is happening tomorrow.\n\n727\n00:41:03.996 --> 00:41:06.986\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n728\n00:41:06.986 --> 00:41:09.740\n&gt;&gt; Get -netIP.\n\n729\n00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.491\nThis is going to be Address.\n\n730\n00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:16.208\nAnd then you need to specify, so\nif you didn't specify the address family,\n\n731\n00:41:16.208 --> 00:41:19.680\nthen it would go ahead and\nreturn just your regular IPv4 here.\n\n732\n00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.030\nSo if you say AddressFamily,\nI just wanted to point this out,\n\n733\n00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.722\nbecause we've been talking about IPV4 and\nIPV6.\n\n734\n00:41:27.722 --> 00:41:33.335\nWe can configure both through these\ncommand lines here, go ahead and hit that.\n\n735\n00:41:33.335 --> 00:41:38.130\nAnd it will give us information\nassociated with that adapter as well.\n\n736\n00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.828\nBut from an IPv6 perspective here and\n\n737\n00:41:40.828 --> 00:41:46.262\nagain you can see that IP address like\nwe talked about earlier, the FE80.\n\n738\n00:41:46.262 --> 00:41:50.462\nAlso, we will talk about\nwith the ISATAP there.\n\n739\n00:41:50.462 --> 00:41:53.562\nJust looking at all of that information.\n\n740\n00:41:53.562 --> 00:41:55.772\n&gt;&gt; Either unicast, prefix link and\n\n741\n00:41:55.772 --> 00:41:57.757\nI think you got a loopback if\nyou scroll down a little bit.\n\n742\n00:41:57.757 --> 00:41:59.752\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see if we can\nsee that on this interface.\n\n743\n00:41:59.752 --> 00:42:04.372\nYep, right there, for our loopback address\nthat we were talking about with that,\n\n744\n00:42:04.372 --> 00:42:06.010\n::1 there.\n\n745\n00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.140\nNot a whole lot of typing.\n\n746\n00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.060\nAll right, again let me just clear this.\n\n747\n00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.550\nI'm trying to think, Set- would\nbe if you wanted to go ahead and\n\n748\n00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.380\nchange that for PowerShell.\n\n749\n00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.424\nAnd I think I have that noted here.\n\n750\n00:42:19.424 --> 00:42:20.800\nI know we're running out of time here.\n\n751\n00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.279\nBut yes, so\nit's pretty straightforward here,\n\n752\n00:42:25.279 --> 00:42:29.232\nto go ahead and\nset the specific IP address.\n\n753\n00:42:29.232 --> 00:42:34.280\nLet me zoom in so\nwe can see this a little better.\n\n754\n00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:39.389\nOkay, so the syntax would be Set- instead\nof Get, before we were just looking at it.\n\n755\n00:42:39.389 --> 00:42:41.913\nSo here we would Set Net IP address,\n\n756\n00:42:41.913 --> 00:42:46.340\nspecify that interface index\nlike we were talking about.\n\n757\n00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.595\nAnd then you could go ahead and\nuse the dash IP address and\n\n758\n00:42:49.595 --> 00:42:51.960\nthen whatever IP address you wanted to.\n\n759\n00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.445\nHere we were giving that\nexample with a dot11 or\n\n760\n00:42:55.445 --> 00:42:58.108\nwhatever it was that you preferred.\n\n761\n00:42:58.108 --> 00:43:01.164\nSo that's that, and then of course,\n\n762\n00:43:01.164 --> 00:43:05.376\nI don't have the GUI on this machine,\nso let me see.\n\n763\n00:43:05.376 --> 00:43:08.458\nI will have to log in to\nanother server real quick.\n\n764\n00:43:08.458 --> 00:43:14.024\nJust to show you,\n[LAUGH] if I can remember my password,\n\n765\n00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:16.808\nhow to do that from the GUI.\n\n766\n00:43:16.808 --> 00:43:21.626\nAnd we don't need to be in PowerShell.\n\n767\n00:43:21.626 --> 00:43:23.290\nI know why I had that open.\n\n768\n00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.198\nOkay, I remember now.\n\n769\n00:43:25.198 --> 00:43:27.460\n[LAUGH] I was playing.\n\n770\n00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.330\nJust like on client side operating\nsystems, if we can go full screen for\n\n771\n00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:35.070\none moment, I want to show in very\nsmall bottom right-hand corner,\n\n772\n00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.728\nyou'll see your little\nEthernet adapter here.\n\n773\n00:43:37.728 --> 00:43:41.250\nIt just says no Internet access because\nI'm working in this lab environment.\n\n774\n00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.920\nBut if I were to right click on top\nof this and open my Network and\n\n775\n00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:49.160\nSharing Center of course, I can also\nnavigate there through Control Panel.\n\n776\n00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.509\nBut on the left hand side I have\nchange adapter settings and\n\n777\n00:43:53.509 --> 00:43:58.568\nagain in this machine for my Ethernet\nzero that was my only adapter so\n\n778\n00:43:58.568 --> 00:44:02.591\nI could just right click\non that particular adapter.\n\n779\n00:44:02.591 --> 00:44:07.425\nSelect Properties and earlier in the first\nshow, Mike you noted that our operating\n\n780\n00:44:07.425 --> 00:44:11.656\nsystems were able to go ahead and\nuse both IP version 4 and IP version 6.\n\n781\n00:44:11.656 --> 00:44:17.510\nAnd I think that change was\na feature that we saw circa Vista.\n\n782\n00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.631\n&gt;&gt; 2008, Mm-hm?\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n783\n00:44:18.631 --> 00:44:24.328\nright there at that time we started\nseeing that dual stack functionality.\n\n784\n00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:28.163\nSo it's not going to hurt anything\nto have them both running,\n\n785\n00:44:28.163 --> 00:44:32.908\nespecially if you are planning on using\nIPv6, it has to be selected there.\n\n786\n00:44:32.908 --> 00:44:36.283\nSo with our IP version 4,\nyou probably have seen this before,\n\n787\n00:44:36.283 --> 00:44:40.232\nthis is where I would go ahead and\nset I definitely needed that IP address,\n\n788\n00:44:40.232 --> 00:44:44.210\nI needed that subnet mask,\neven just to communicate locally there.\n\n789\n00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.512\nDidn't really need the default gateway\nunless I was leaving my networks.\n\n790\n00:44:47.512 --> 00:44:53.550\nI could set it manually or if I were using\nDHCP, I could obtain it automatically.\n\n791\n00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.069\nAll right,\nwe’ll just cancel out of here, but\n\n792\n00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:59.468\nsame thing with IP version\n6 that I see here.\n\n793\n00:44:59.468 --> 00:45:04.688\nThis is where I would go ahead and\nspecify either using DHCP version 6,\n\n794\n00:45:04.688 --> 00:45:10.350\nor some other auto configuration\ntechnique that we spoke about there.\n\n795\n00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:14.970\nOr I could specify and\nset an IP address then I’d just\n\n796\n00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:18.600\nhad one noted there to go ahead and\nput that in.\n\n797\n00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.820\nI don't think I mentioned this, while\nwe're right here, I know we're getting\n\n798\n00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:28.760\nshort on time but zooming in you see\nthe percent sign at the very end there.\n\n799\n00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.010\nI say that, let me try to.\n\n800\n00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.629\nI don't know if you can see that,\nit's a person sign and then 12.\n\n801\n00:45:33.629 --> 00:45:39.987\nAnd that's when the referencing as zone ID\nbecause if we think about having multiple\n\n802\n00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:46.073\ninterfaces on our router or whatever, it\ncan use the same portion before that and\n\n803\n00:45:46.073 --> 00:45:51.610\njust really identify that interface\nby that particular zone ID there.\n\n804\n00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.397\nSo that's what that would be referenced.\n\n805\n00:45:54.397 --> 00:45:57.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz if we have\na multi home device, we have-\n\n806\n00:45:57.246 --> 00:45:58.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n807\n00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:01.189\n&gt;&gt; More than one network adapter,\nimagine a server with more than one\n\n808\n00:46:01.189 --> 00:46:05.141\nnetwork adapter in it, well, every network\nadapter is gonna go through the process\n\n809\n00:46:05.141 --> 00:46:08.607\nof generating a link local IPv6 address,\nthat's part of the protocol.\n\n810\n00:46:08.607 --> 00:46:15.006\nSo you can have to adapters that\nhave a FE80 colon colon address.\n\n811\n00:46:15.006 --> 00:46:19.002\nAnd the OS needs to make sure it\nunderstands which address to use when it's\n\n812\n00:46:19.002 --> 00:46:21.009\ncommunicating with which adapter.\n\n813\n00:46:21.009 --> 00:46:23.888\nAnd so that zone ID it assigns\nthat to the end of it,\n\n814\n00:46:23.888 --> 00:46:29.100\nunderstand too that the zone ID this is\nwhere people I think will get confused.\n\n815\n00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.477\nIt's generated by the machine and\nit's only good for that machine.\n\n816\n00:46:33.477 --> 00:46:36.600\nIn other words, you could take two\nmachines connected to the same network and\n\n817\n00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.720\nthey could have different zones IDs.\n\n818\n00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.950\nSo it's not a number that gets\nassigned to the network and\n\n819\n00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.990\neverybody on the network uses it.\n\n820\n00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.490\nIt's only a number used\ninternally by that machine\n\n821\n00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:50.220\nto differentiate between link local\naddresses on different networks or\n\n822\n00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.170\nwhich one is supposed to use for different\nnetworks, just keep that in mind.\n\n823\n00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.646\nCuz I know people go,\nwhy don't they all say percent well?\n\n824\n00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:58.345\nOr sometimes it says percent three,\nor something like that.\n\n825\n00:46:58.345 --> 00:47:01.750\nIt's just an internal identifier\nthat the system uses.\n\n826\n00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:06.349\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and again you have the same\noptions like we saw with IPv4 for\n\n827\n00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:10.720\nour subnet here,\nthe subnet prefix link, excuse me.\n\n828\n00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.924\nAs well as our default gateway,\nand then setting that statically-\n\n829\n00:47:13.924 --> 00:47:15.494\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you this,\n\n830\n00:47:15.494 --> 00:47:20.206\nwhen I first saw this window,\nthis is when I realized because you\n\n831\n00:47:20.206 --> 00:47:25.197\nlook at IP before and the fields\nthat you're typing in are yea wide.\n\n832\n00:47:25.197 --> 00:47:27.311\nAnd then open up IPv6 and\nit's a mile wide-\n\n833\n00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:28.515\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n834\n00:47:28.515 --> 00:47:29.064\n&gt;&gt; It's so much bigger.\n\n835\n00:47:29.064 --> 00:47:32.380\n&gt;&gt; And that's when I realized I really\nwanna learn about auto configuration.\n\n836\n00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.884\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, realistically-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n837\n00:47:34.884 --> 00:47:40.154\nthere's gonna be times when you gotta\nneed to statically match certain devices.\n\n838\n00:47:40.154 --> 00:47:41.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true.\n&gt;&gt; And you know we tease and\n\n839\n00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.429\nwe give a hard time.\n\n840\n00:47:42.429 --> 00:47:47.520\nBut you're gonna have a company prefix,\nand it doesn't have to be that long.\n\n841\n00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.737\nYour interface ID is while there's 64 bits\navailable if you're statically mapping,\n\n842\n00:47:52.737 --> 00:47:56.087\nthere's nothing that says\nyou have to use all 64 bits.\n\n843\n00:47:56.087 --> 00:47:59.640\nI mean, I can do ::2 or\nwhatever I need to do.\n\n844\n00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.348\nSo it's not as bad as it looks.\n\n845\n00:48:01.348 --> 00:48:03.242\nBut I tell you,\nthe first time I saw the window-\n\n846\n00:48:03.242 --> 00:48:05.439\n&gt;&gt; It can be intimidating, for sure.\n\n847\n00:48:05.439 --> 00:48:06.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got a little scared [LAUGH].\n\n848\n00:48:06.602 --> 00:48:09.629\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well on that note,\nIPv6 is not really scary.\n\n849\n00:48:09.629 --> 00:48:13.073\nJust spend a little extra time getting\nto know it if you're not too familiar.\n\n850\n00:48:13.073 --> 00:48:14.850\nDefinitely take a look at the show notes.\n\n851\n00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.371\nI'll attach those documents.\n\n852\n00:48:16.371 --> 00:48:21.257\nAnd remember the different states,\nprefixes,\n\n853\n00:48:21.257 --> 00:48:26.390\nbits, and\nways that you can select those options.\n\n854\n00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:29.126\nI think that's about as much\nadvice as I can give you here.\n\n855\n00:48:29.126 --> 00:48:30.127\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n856\n00:48:30.127 --> 00:48:32.471\nwell that was a lot of great information.\n\n857\n00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:36.487\nDealing with both IPv4 as well as IPv6.\n\n858\n00:48:36.487 --> 00:48:38.780\nSo we thank you for that, Cherokee.\n\n859\n00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.948\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n860\n00:48:40.948 --> 00:48:44.040\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n861\n00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:44.658\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee

00:00:06.533\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.148\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:11.734\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:15.408\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to your 70-410 series.\n\n7\n00:00:15.408 --> 00:00:17.860\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.220\nIn this episode, we'll be taking a look at\nwell how to install domain controllers.\n\n9\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.050\nAnd with us today in studios, we have Mr.\nMike Rodrick, how's it going today Mike?\n\n10\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.063\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:28.700\n&gt;&gt; Always, yeah.\n\n12\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.637\n&gt;&gt; Yes, excited to be here as always,\n\n13\n00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:35.450\ncuz we're talking about one of my favorite\ntopics and that is Active Directory.\n\n14\n00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.380\nAll right, so\nif we're gonna work with Active Directory,\n\n15\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.220\nwhich is what we want to do in the end,\nwe need to get it installed.\n\n16\n00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.240\nWe need to create these\ndomain controllers, and\n\n17\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.720\nI guess that's where we should start.\n\n18\n00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.610\nWhen we talk about a domain\ncontroller what we're doing is,\n\n19\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.680\nwe're installing the Active Directory\ndomain services role on a member server.\n\n20\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.019\nWe're taking a server,\nwe install that role, and\n\n21\n00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.906\nthat makes it becomes a domain controller.\n\n22\n00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:03.521\nAnd we know in our domain environments,\n\n23\n00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:07.190\ndomain controllers are the ones that\nare in charge of security, for example.\n\n24\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.631\nThey are trusted throughout the domain.\n\n25\n00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:10.470\nThey do the authentication process.\n\n26\n00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.143\nThey issue the ticket granting tickets and\nthe service granting tickets.\n\n27\n00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:18.829\nAnd they issue or they, what else they-\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n28\n00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.294\nbasically, I think you have even\nexplained it this way before,\n\n29\n00:01:22.294 --> 00:01:25.899\nthey're like the yellow pages\nof computer network here, right?\n\n30\n00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:26.421\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n31\n00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.520\n&gt;&gt; So they're housing that information\nthat we need to know within our networks.\n\n32\n00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.980\n&gt;&gt; They do, they store the database\nwith all the user accounts,\n\n33\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.380\nall the computer accounts.\n\n34\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.280\nResponsible for deploying group policy\nout to our machines and to our users.\n\n35\n00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.060\nSo they are the pivot or\nthe key component in our domain.\n\n36\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.670\nSo we need to know how\nto install those guys.\n\n37\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.645\nAnd that's what we're gonna do in\nthese next couple of episodes,\n\n38\n00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:49.830\ncuz there are really several different\nways to install domain controllers\n\n39\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.600\ndepending on what you have and\nwhat route you wanna go.\n\n40\n00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.780\nWe also have to understand\nwhat we have before we start.\n\n41\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.751\nWe need to talk about a couple of things.\n\n42\n00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:03.659\nWe need to talk about functional levels\nat both the domain and the forest level,\n\n43\n00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.272\nas well as a tool that we would use known\nas ADPrep to get everything ready for\n\n44\n00:02:08.272 --> 00:02:11.910\nour brand new 2012 R2 domain controller.\n\n45\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.258\nSo let's start out Cherokee talking\nabout good old functional levels, right?\n\n46\n00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:15.936\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n47\n00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:17.636\n&gt;&gt; And when talk about functional levels,\n\n48\n00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:19.930\nwe have to deal with it\nat two different scopes.\n\n49\n00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.130\nThere's the forest functional level and\nthen there's the domain functional level.\n\n50\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.220\nAnd when we look at servers, right?\n\n51\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.470\nWhen they roll out a new operating system.\n\n52\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.968\nServer 2012, Server 2012 R2,\nServer 2016 down the road, right?\n\n53\n00:02:32.968 --> 00:02:37.384\nWhen they roll out these new operating\nsystems, they bring along new features and\n\n54\n00:02:37.384 --> 00:02:38.924\nnew capabilities, right?\n\n55\n00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:42.400\nThey're not just rolling out the same\nold operating system and renumbering it.\n\n56\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, why else would we pay for it?\n\n57\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.357\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n58\n00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:45.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's the point?\n\n59\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.230\nSo we get these new features.\n\n60\n00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.220\nAnd a lot of times these new features\nare understood by that new version of\n\n61\n00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.370\nthe operating system, but\nnot the old ones, right?\n\n62\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.850\nThey're new features,\nthey were written after 2008 was put out.\n\n63\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.630\nSo 2008 doesn't understand group manage\nservices accounts, for example, or\n\n64\n00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.880\nsomething like that.\n\n65\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.430\nSo when we look at functional levels,\nreally what we're doing is,\n\n66\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.830\nwe're deciding what features\nare going to be available.\n\n67\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.672\nBecause if I'm installing a 2012 R2\ndomain controller in an existing domain\n\n68\n00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:16.849\nthat already has a bunch of 2008 main\ncontrollers, that 2012 domain controller\n\n69\n00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.539\nis gonna know how to do things that\nthose 2008 domain controllers don't.\n\n70\n00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.467\nAnd there's gonna be some things that\nare incompatible between those versions\n\n71\n00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:25.313\nbetween those versions\nof the operating system.\n\n72\n00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:26.453\n&gt;&gt; Well, it makes sense,\n\n73\n00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:30.215\nif Microsoft is putting their developers\non to the new project or the new team,\n\n74\n00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:33.820\nthey're not gonna spend as much effort\non those older operation systems.\n\n75\n00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.460\nThey're not abandoning them,\nbut they phase them out.\n\n76\n00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.062\nAnd you guys see that with\nthe different versions.\n\n77\n00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:42.405\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, eventually support runs out for\n2003 or 2008 or whatever,\n\n78\n00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:44.162\nand eventually for 2012, right?\n\n79\n00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:47.210\n2012 R2 as 2016 rolls out.\n\n80\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.110\nSo what we have to do,\nwe have to prepare our environment for\n\n81\n00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.610\nthese new operating systems.\n\n82\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.950\nWhen we were running in an existing\ndomain, it's been running for years,\n\n83\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.200\nlet's say we're running 2008 R2 and\nwe decide it's time to start upgrading\n\n84\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.600\nto 2012, or 2012 R2, then we need\nto prepare the environment for\n\n85\n00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.460\nthat new operating system and\nthose new capabilities.\n\n86\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.450\nAnd we do that with the functional levels.\n\n87\n00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.050\nThose functional levels really cap or\ndetermine what\n\n88\n00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.060\nfeatures are going to be available to\nthe Active Director domain service.\n\n89\n00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.690\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\nyou mentioned something earlier,\n\n90\n00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.580\nyou said there are two different\nfunctional levels that we should consider.\n\n91\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.010\nWe have our domain functional level and\nour forest.\n\n92\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.952\nSo if I were brand new to\nthis terminology here,\n\n93\n00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:29.685\nwhat differentiates a forest and a domain?\n\n94\n00:04:29.685 --> 00:04:35.320\n&gt;&gt; So a domain is a security boundary,\nif you will.\n\n95\n00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.200\nWe have domain controllers.\n\n96\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.080\nWe have objects that\nexist within that domain.\n\n97\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.400\nA forest is a container of domains,\n\n98\n00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.830\nI can have more than one\ndomain within my forest.\n\n99\n00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.690\nThe forest also acts as\na security boundary.\n\n100\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.130\nAnd we look at a domain, for example,\n\n101\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.720\nyou have the domain admins who have\nfull control within that domain.\n\n102\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.200\nThey have no rights\noutside of their domain.\n\n103\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.440\nBut we have a forest, and\n\n104\n00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.500\nwe have an enterprise admin\nthat has forest-wide rights.\n\n105\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.470\nSo if I had two domains in this forest,\nthe enterprise admin actually has\n\n106\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.180\nadministrative rights over\nboth domains in that forest.\n\n107\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.275\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we always have a forest.\n\n108\n00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:15.721\nWe always have a domain, but we could have\nmultiple domains inside of my forest.\n\n109\n00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:16.257\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n110\n00:05:16.257 --> 00:05:21.515\nWe have domain trees, we can have\nparent-child domains, definitely we can.\n\n111\n00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:26.292\nIt used to be, I'll tell you, I've seen\na shift for all of for 5, 10 years ago,\n\n112\n00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:30.620\nwe saw this thing where creating\nmultiple domains was the way to go.\n\n113\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.790\nNowadays, really if you look at\nMicrosoft recommendations of what most\n\n114\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.340\norganizations are doing.\n\n115\n00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.530\nWe can accomplish what we\nneed with a single domain.\n\n116\n00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.110\nSo it's not as often that we need\nmultiple domains, but there are times.\n\n117\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.170\nWhen you have a situation where\nyou've got a control administration.\n\n118\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.920\nIf I have resources that I need to\nprotect within a single domain,\n\n119\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.310\nthe domain admin, I can't control his\naccess, he has access to everything.\n\n120\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.460\nSo any domain admin in that domain can\nadminister any object within there.\n\n121\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.825\nIf I need separation of that, like let's\nsay, I've got an office in Europe and\n\n122\n00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:06.729\nI've got an office here in the US.\n\n123\n00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.531\nAnd I don't need the European\nadministrators administering objects in\n\n124\n00:06:11.531 --> 00:06:13.710\nthe US, and vice versus.\n\n125\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.452\nWell, if we're all in one domain,\n\n126\n00:06:15.452 --> 00:06:18.772\nit becomes more difficult to\nseparate [CROSSTALK] administration.\n\n127\n00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:19.733\n&gt;&gt; Logically, yeah\n&gt;&gt; Cuz now\n\n128\n00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:22.620\nI've gotta create custom group\nit's going to be a pain.\n\n129\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.780\nWhereas if I have two different domains,\nright?\n\n130\n00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.520\nI can have domain admins in the US office,\ndomain admins in the Europe office, and\n\n131\n00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.840\nthey can't affect each other, rIght?\n\n132\n00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.930\nOnly the enterprise admin then\ncould affect both domains.\n\n133\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.330\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to the functional level.\n\n134\n00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.326\nSo we have different functional\nlevels at the domain level, and\n\n135\n00:06:40.326 --> 00:06:43.144\nat what we call the forest\nfunctional level.\n\n136\n00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:48.100\nAnd as I said, they really do just define\nwhat features are gonna be available.\n\n137\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.480\nWhen I go to install, let's say,\n\n138\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.260\nwe're running a 2008 R2\ndomain controllers, right?\n\n139\n00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.270\nMy domain functional level is\nmost likely gonna be 2008 R2.\n\n140\n00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.260\nAnd what that means is,\nthat's the highest I can go.\n\n141\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.608\nI cannot have any domain controllers\nabove that the domain functional level.\n\n142\n00:07:04.608 --> 00:07:08.920\nThe domain functional level\nis determined by the lowest\n\n143\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.310\noperating system within that domain.\n\n144\n00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.160\n&gt;&gt; So the oldest?\n\n145\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.145\n&gt;&gt; The oldest operating system is\nanother way to look at it exactly.\n\n146\n00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:20.034\nSo if within my domain,\nI have a 2008 domain controller,\n\n147\n00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:25.790\na 2012 the main controller, and\na 2012 R2 domain controller.\n\n148\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.670\nMy domain functional\nlevel can only be 2008,\n\n149\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.710\nbecause I still have\na 2008 domain controller.\n\n150\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.820\nIt's the oldest one,\n\n151\n00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.501\ntherefore that's the highest I can\nraise the domain functional level to,\n\n152\n00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:39.259\nwhich means I can't take advantage\nof some of those 2012 R2 features.\n\n153\n00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:43.410\nI have to kind of dumb everybody down\nto the lowest domain controller.\n\n154\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.441\nNow once I get rid of that\n2008 domain controller, right?\n\n155\n00:07:46.441 --> 00:07:49.350\nNow my lowest domain controller's 2012.\n\n156\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.960\nI can raise my domain\nfunctional level to 2012, and\n\n157\n00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.540\nstart taking advantage of\nsome of those features.\n\n158\n00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.590\n&gt;&gt; So this is pretty important\nwhen you talking about planning.\n\n159\n00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.478\nYou wanna kind of keep that in mind,\nso that you're not,\n\n160\n00:08:00.478 --> 00:08:03.197\nI guess forfeiting any of\nthose cooler new features.\n\n161\n00:08:03.197 --> 00:08:07.222\nAnd you can really work towards\nphasing out that older one.\n\n162\n00:08:07.222 --> 00:08:10.165\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, and this is something\nyou would go out to TechNet and\n\n163\n00:08:10.165 --> 00:08:12.862\nlook at their domain function levels and\nsee what you'd get.\n\n164\n00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:17.650\nLike going from 2012 to 2012\nR2 domain functional level\n\n165\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.850\nmight not give you that many features.\n\n166\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.810\nBut it's gonna prevent you, one thing\nthe domain functional level will do.\n\n167\n00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.870\nOnce you raise it to a certain bar.\n\n168\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.170\nLet's say we raise it from 2008 to 2012.\n\n169\n00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:33.050\nI can never go back and I can not install\nany 2008 domain controllers in that\n\n170\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.000\ndomain anymore because\nthe functional level is too high.\n\n171\n00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.368\nIt's set up here so\nI cannot install any domain controllers.\n\n172\n00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:43.581\nAnd in some organizations they might say,\nhey look we need another domain controller\n\n173\n00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:46.753\nright now and the only machine\nI've got available is 2008.\n\n174\n00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:49.780\nYou're in trouble, you're not gonna be\nable to make that a domain controller.\n\n175\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.120\nBecause you raise the domain\nfunctional level.\n\n176\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.360\nAnd maybe you did it for a good reason or\n\n177\n00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.800\nmaybe you did it just\nbecause higher is better.\n\n178\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.890\nAnd that's what you don't wanna fall\ninto because you set that bar and\n\n179\n00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.930\nyou can't go back.\n\n180\n00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Which is easy for a lot of people like\nus who enjoy tech, and trying the latest\n\n181\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.162\nand greatest and sometimes even\ngoing with those beta additions.\n\n182\n00:09:09.162 --> 00:09:12.332\nBut when we're talking about\nbusinesses and being in a production or\n\n183\n00:09:12.332 --> 00:09:15.200\ncorporate environment,\nthat's not always the best idea.\n\n184\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.477\n&gt;&gt; It's not always the best\nto be on the edge, right?\n\n185\n00:09:17.477 --> 00:09:18.971\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And get out there, but\n\n186\n00:09:18.971 --> 00:09:21.360\nit is something that you've\ngot to decide again.\n\n187\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.159\nYou can look at TechNet's\ndocumentation and say, look.\n\n188\n00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:26.880\n2012 R 2 brings this capability.\n\n189\n00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.670\nThis is something we really need.\n\n190\n00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.100\nWe're gonna now work on making sure\nall our domain controllers are at\n\n191\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.950\nleast 2012 R2, and then we can\nraise that functional level, and\n\n192\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.760\nwe can start talking about or taking\nadvantage of some of those new features.\n\n193\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.280\nNow if we take that same concept.\n\n194\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.230\nSo, within my domain,\n\n195\n00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.470\nthe lowest domain controller is as high\nas I can raise the functional level.\n\n196\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.100\nAnd the lowest domain controller\ndetermines what the functional level is.\n\n197\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.478\nCan't raise it any higher until\nI get rid of those, right.\n\n198\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.240\nTake that same concept, and\nnow apply it to a forest.\n\n199\n00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.810\nBut instead of looking at\nindividual domain controllers,\n\n200\n00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.890\nwe're looking at the domain itself.\n\n201\n00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:09.451\nSo within my forest I have one domain\nwho's all its domain controllers are 2008.\n\n202\n00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:13.002\nAnd that domain functional\nlevel is therefore 2008.\n\n203\n00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:15.490\nI've got a second domain in my forest.\n\n204\n00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.990\nAll of their domain\ncontrollers are 2012 R2.\n\n205\n00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:23.015\nAnd they've went ahead and raised\nthe domain functional level to 2012 R2.\n\n206\n00:10:23.015 --> 00:10:27.384\nSo I've got one domain in my forest\nrunning at 2008 domain functional level,\n\n207\n00:10:27.384 --> 00:10:30.697\nI've got one domain running\n2012 R2 functional level.\n\n208\n00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:35.634\nMy forest functional level is determined\nby the lowest domain functional level,\n\n209\n00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:36.354\nall right.\n\n210\n00:10:36.354 --> 00:10:40.430\nSo that means my forest could only be\n2008 because I still have one domain,\n\n211\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.670\nrunning in 2008 domain functional level.\n\n212\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just to kind of\nreiterate what you said there, Mike.\n\n213\n00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.500\nWe do have a question in the chat.\n\n214\n00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.380\nAnd Tim asks, so\n\n215\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.240\ndoes anything stop working when\nyou raise that functional level?\n\n216\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.930\nHis network's still at\na 2000 functional level.\n\n217\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.690\nSo that answer is yes, most definitely.\n\n218\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.980\nThere are gonna be features\nthat are not available.\n\n219\n00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.390\nAnd that's what we were\ntalking about earlier.\n\n220\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.790\nIn the older operating\nsystems that we see today.\n\n221\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.230\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, that's something\nyou definitely wanna check on.\n\n222\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.520\nEvidently, in your organization, you're\nprobably not taking advantage of any of\n\n223\n00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.390\nthose features, or don't miss them,\nso maybe there really isn't a reason.\n\n224\n00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.960\nThey might have a good reason for staying\nat 2000 functional level if they plan on,\n\n225\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.250\nhopefully not they don't add on\nplanning on adding more 2,000 domain\n\n226\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.355\ncontrollers since those are no longer\nsupported, I only think 2003 is supported.\n\n227\n00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:30.530\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n228\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.740\n&gt;&gt; So it might be something you look into\nand you talk to your network admins,\n\n229\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.120\nreview the network admin,\nyou look and you say.\n\n230\n00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, there's really no\ngood reason for staying, and\n\n231\n00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.660\nwe're missing out on all these features\nthat we could be taking advantage of.\n\n232\n00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.874\nThe other thing you might\nwanna look at is security.\n\n233\n00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:47.977\nA 2000 domain functional level,\nI wanna say some of your\n\n234\n00:11:47.977 --> 00:11:52.890\nauthentication protocols might have\nto stay at a lower level, as well.\n\n235\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.890\nSo you might actually be more secure.\n\n236\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.490\nIf you don't have a good reason.\n\n237\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.684\nAnd again, this is a per case thing, so\nI can't tell you exactly what to do.\n\n238\n00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:03.630\nYou guys are gonna have to look and\nfigure that out in your environment.\n\n239\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.300\nBut if you can't find a good\ncompelling reason for\n\n240\n00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.760\nstaying at that low of a functional level,\nmaybe you wanna raise that up at least\n\n241\n00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.930\nto 2008 or whatever your\nlowest domain controllers are.\n\n242\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.580\nSo something to take a look at.\n\n243\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.219\nBut as you can see from that question,\n\n244\n00:12:18.219 --> 00:12:22.439\nthere's nothing preventing\nyou from staying at 2000.\n\n245\n00:12:22.439 --> 00:12:24.610\nEven in this day, you're running 2012 R2.\n\n246\n00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.352\nI can still be in 2000 mode.\n\n247\n00:12:26.352 --> 00:12:30.912\nNow if you start off with the 2012 domain\ncontroller, you can't choose 2000 mode.\n\n248\n00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:32.268\nIt's not even in the options anymore.\n\n249\n00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:36.160\nI think 2003 is the oldest\nyou can drop down to.\n\n250\n00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.610\nThey won't even let you choose\nwhat they called mixed mode.\n\n251\n00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.380\nAnymore, I think they\nused to call it that.\n\n252\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.840\nAll right, so forest functional level,\nthen, is just the same thing.\n\n253\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.340\nExcept now we treat the domain as a unit.\n\n254\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.270\nAnd let's say we had that forest that\nwas at 2008 forest functional level.\n\n255\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:57.330\nBecause one domain is 2008\ndomain functional level.\n\n256\n00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.400\nOne domain is 2012 R2 functional level.\n\n257\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.944\nIn order to raise my forest, I have to\nget all domains to that particular level.\n\n258\n00:13:05.944 --> 00:13:10.773\nSo that 2008 domain functional level\ndomain, I've gotta go into that domain,\n\n259\n00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:15.343\nI've gotta raise all the domain\ncontrollers in there to at least 2012 R2.\n\n260\n00:13:15.343 --> 00:13:19.460\nThen I've gotta raise the domain\nfunctional level to 2012 R2.\n\n261\n00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.000\nNow that both domains, or\nall the domains in my forest, are 2012 R2.\n\n262\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.030\nI can raise the forest\nfunctional level to 2012 R2.\n\n263\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.792\nAgain it's kind of the same thing.\n\n264\n00:13:29.792 --> 00:13:32.390\nYou wannao look at the features and\ndetermine whether or\n\n265\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.490\nnot this is something I want to do.\n\n266\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.440\nBecause once I raised that\nforest functional level,\n\n267\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.080\nI can never add a domain that's\nanywhere below that level.\n\n268\n00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.030\nAnd this is a real good gotcha.\n\n269\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.110\nLet's say you're running all\nthe latest and greatest equipment.\n\n270\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.630\nYour only domain is running all\n2012 R2 domain controller so\n\n271\n00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.194\nyour domain functional level is 2012 R2.\n\n272\n00:13:52.194 --> 00:13:54.354\nYour forest is also 2012 R2, cuz you said,\n\n273\n00:13:54.354 --> 00:13:58.610\nhey we're just the we just use the latest\nand greatest, we're good to go.\n\n274\n00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.500\nAnd then what happens is your boss says\nhey, we're buying this other company.\n\n275\n00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.880\nWe need to bring their\ndomain into our forest.\n\n276\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.321\nAnd you go look at their domain, and\nthey have ten 2008 domain controllers.\n\n277\n00:14:09.321 --> 00:14:12.669\nAnd now all of a sudden I can't\nbring that domain into my forest,\n\n278\n00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:15.490\nbecause my forest functional\nlevel is 2012 R2.\n\n279\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.870\nAnd until I raise their domain controller,\ndo the upgrade, pay for the licensing,\n\n280\n00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.310\nall that good stuff,\nI can't bring that domain in.\n\n281\n00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.440\nSo you can end up blocking yourself.\n\n282\n00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.100\nSo it's really something\nthat you have to plan.\n\n283\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.776\n&gt;&gt; So I also see another\nquestion here from Doug Mike.\n\n284\n00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:31.690\nSo we've got a lot of questions here\nabout this functional level and\n\n285\n00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.940\nlike you just were saying there,\nsome of the risks associated with that.\n\n286\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:40.338\nSo if I decide I'm gonna take the plunge,\nI'm gonna jump into that new 2012 R2.\n\n287\n00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:43.534\nAnd well depending on when you're\nwatching this the time, but\n\n288\n00:14:43.534 --> 00:14:44.991\nthe latest and greatest OS.\n\n289\n00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:49.430\nThen, there's no rollback\noption per se here.\n\n290\n00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, I will tell you that I've\nbeen teaching this a long time.\n\n291\n00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.080\nAnd in the past,\nthere's no way to go back.\n\n292\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.200\nOnce you raise your functional level,\nthat's it.\n\n293\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.400\nI will say there were 2012 R2\nthat give you the ability to\n\n294\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.770\ndowngrade the functional level but\nit's one of those things actually risk.\n\n295\n00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.910\nI don't think I would ever try to do that.\n\n296\n00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.230\nThey say it can be done.\n\n297\n00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.050\nIt's kind of like renaming\na domain controller.\n\n298\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.183\nI just wouldn't do it.\n\n299\n00:15:14.183 --> 00:15:14.683\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n300\n00:15:14.683 --> 00:15:15.326\n&gt;&gt; There's not enough\n\n301\n00:15:15.326 --> 00:15:15.963\nreward,\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n302\n00:15:15.963 --> 00:15:17.166\n&gt;&gt; For the risk involved.\n\n303\n00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:18.339\nSo I would plan better.\n\n304\n00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:21.520\nI would make sure that you don't raise it\n\n305\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.710\nuntil you're sure you're\nnever gonna need to go back.\n\n306\n00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.720\nBecause there is actually an option now.\n\n307\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.300\nUsed to be that you couldn't do it at all.\n\n308\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.190\nThere is an option to roll\nback if things go terribly.\n\n309\n00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.170\nBut really the only risk you're running\nby raising the functional level,\n\n310\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.100\nis not being able to add any\ndown level domain controllers.\n\n311\n00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.930\nOr, not being able to add any\ndown level domains to my forest.\n\n312\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.945\nThat's really the only\nrisk you're running.\n\n313\n00:15:49.945 --> 00:15:53.035\nYou're not gonna lose features\nthat you're depending on,\n\n314\n00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:57.227\nunless you're dependent on one of those\nolder than occasion protocols, right?\n\n315\n00:15:57.227 --> 00:16:00.825\nSo, the real risk is just\nNot being able to go back,\n\n316\n00:16:00.825 --> 00:16:06.130\nand not being able to implement all\nof our operating systems anymore.\n\n317\n00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.730\nAnd that's the only real\nthing I think that you're\n\n318\n00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.630\ngonna run into if you raise\nthat functional level.\n\n319\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.650\nSo as long as you plan out,\n\n320\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.080\nas long as you're sure you're not gonna\nneed to install a 2003 domain controller,\n\n321\n00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.680\nyou'll raise it up to 2008, or 2008,\nor 2012, or whatever the case may be.\n\n322\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.690\nBut again, look at the features, I can't\nstress it enough, go out to Microsoft,\n\n323\n00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:33.220\ndo some research on functional levels,\nboth of the domain and the forest.\n\n324\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.880\nCuz I will tell you there's several times,\nespecially\n\n325\n00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.130\nwith the 12 to 12R2 type things, ot of\ntimes those in-between jumps, you might\n\n326\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.980\nnot see any functional difference\nbetween going from 2012 to 2012 R2.\n\n327\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.570\nAnd at the forest level especially\nyou might not see any difference, so\n\n328\n00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:53.290\nreally the only purpose for raising it is\nto make sure I can't have any down level\n\n329\n00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:59.460\ndomains coming into play because I don't\nwant any older 2008 domains in my forest.\n\n330\n00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.580\nSo make sure you look and if there's no\nreal benefit there's no real reason to\n\n331\n00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.850\nupgrade unless you just have to make\nsure you don't want anybody implementing\n\n332\n00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.145\nolder domain controllers or\nolder domains in your environment.\n\n333\n00:17:11.145 --> 00:17:14.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nif I have a pre-existing domain,\n\n334\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:19.490\nthose are definitely some considerations,\nbut Mike what if I were helping a startup\n\n335\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.290\ncompany and they've asked me hey I would\nlike to implement Active Directory.\n\n336\n00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.750\nCan you help define and create my network?\n\n337\n00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.920\nWhere would we begin in\nthat type of situation?\n\n338\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.090\n&gt;&gt; You know that's one of those\nrare things you just don't get\n\n339\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.683\nto see very often.\n\n340\n00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:32.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\nThose are fun and exciting.\n\n341\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.790\nIt's like a little gem.\n\n342\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nTo be a part of a network from\n\n343\n00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.900\nthe ground up.\n\n344\n00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.120\nYou know,\nin test environments all day long, right?\n\n345\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.810\nBut in the real world, you get a job\nsomewhere and they've already got.\n\n346\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.984\nThis isn't 1985 or 1990 and\nthey've already got a network,\n\n347\n00:17:44.984 --> 00:17:46.073\nthey've got domains.\n\n348\n00:17:46.073 --> 00:17:50.028\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't get to see brand new creation\n\n349\n00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.615\nthat often.\n\n350\n00:17:51.615 --> 00:17:52.605\nSo I'm gonna show you.\n\n351\n00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:56.170\nIt's not all that exciting, but\nit is kind of, if you're geeky like us.\n\n352\n00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.680\nThat's why you guys are watching, right.\n\n353\n00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is cool.\n\n354\n00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.430\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of cool, yes.\n\n355\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.900\n&gt;&gt; And I was just talking to someone\nabout that even before this show,\n\n356\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.930\neven about wiring.\n\n357\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.510\nYou know, it's always great to go into\nan environment and begin the wiring and\n\n358\n00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.430\ndesign it, instead of going back and\nfixing or replacing old wires,\n\n359\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.490\nand pulling cables.\n\n360\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.160\n&gt;&gt; Wondering why somebody did it this way.\n\n361\n00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.220\nWhy would you ever do it this way?\n\n362\n00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.250\nThis is not how I would do it, right?\n\n363\n00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:22.470\nSo just a lesson you should always learn,\nthat we should all be aware of.\n\n364\n00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.550\nNever say anything like that until\nyou find out why they did it.\n\n365\n00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.290\n&gt;&gt; Who did it?\n\n366\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.240\nWhy? [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Because I\nran into that one time.\n\n367\n00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.910\nI was in a server, I was like why\nwould anybody ever do it this way?\n\n368\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.910\nThis is just stupid.\n\n369\n00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.470\nBut then after talking to the person that\ndid it and realizing why they did it,\n\n370\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.930\nthere was a very good reason for\ndoing that way.\n\n371\n00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.850\nAnd then I felt like the you-know-what\nbecause I jumped to conclusions.\n\n372\n00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.560\nSo always find out why first.\n\n373\n00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.070\nThe variable could be a reason.\n\n374\n00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI felt like one time I was on Punk'd\n\n375\n00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.170\nwith Ashton Kutcher in the server closet.\n\n376\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:53.740\nI'm looking around.\n\n377\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.610\nI'm like, where's the cameras?\n\n378\n00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.555\nThere's literally bubblegum on the cables.\n\n379\n00:18:57.555 --> 00:18:58.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n&gt;&gt; And that's when I started\n\n380\n00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.370\nlooking for the cameras.\n\n381\n00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.703\nI'm like, I think it's about time to go.\n\n382\n00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:01.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll let you deal with this.\n\n383\n00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hey if you gotta patch a cable with\n\n384\n00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.591\nbubblegum, you know the MacGyver thing.\n\n385\n00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:06.563\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:07.064\n&gt;&gt; My God.\n\n387\n00:19:07.064 --> 00:19:07.946\nWhat is this? This is a joke.\n\n388\n00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:08.738\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyways.\n\n389\n00:19:08.738 --> 00:19:09.238\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n390\n00:19:09.238 --> 00:19:09.738\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n391\n00:19:09.738 --> 00:19:11.460\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n392\n00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.090\nAnd I just wanna kinda lay this out for\n\n393\n00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.180\nyou so we're going to start with nothing.\n\n394\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.740\nI've just got a bunch of computers here.\n\n395\n00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.910\nI've got some servers.\n\n396\n00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.020\nMaybe we're in a workgroup,\nmaybe we're just setting things up.\n\n397\n00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.600\nAnd in order to create a domain, we're\ngoing to take one of these servers and\n\n398\n00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.870\nwe're going to install the role active\ndirectory domain service is on.\n\n399\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.350\nAll right,\nthat is going to create our domain.\n\n400\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.120\nBefore you've got nothing, just blackness.\n\n401\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.410\nWe take a server and\nwe install Active Directory on it.\n\n402\n00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.040\nAnd what that's gonna do is\nit's gonna create a domain.\n\n403\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.230\nSo when we're done, oops,\nthat is not what I wanted to do.\n\n404\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.930\nLet's try that again.\n\n405\n00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.860\nMy little drawing tool's not\nplaying along nicely here.\n\n406\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.620\nWe're gonna end up with a domain.\n\n407\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.250\nLet's put that server\nback in the middle there.\n\n408\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:00.440\nAnd maybe we call this domain something\nlike, I don't know, ITPro.tv and\n\n409\n00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.940\nwe make sure that that text is white so\n\n410\n00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.220\nthat we can actually see it on\nthat dark background, right?\n\n411\n00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.690\nSo we create our first domain and\nit's named ITPro.tv, so\n\n412\n00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:16.710\nby installing active directory domain\nservices on a server you create a domain.\n\n413\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.310\nMost people are aware of this.\n\n414\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.100\nBut what you might not be aware of\nis that you creat something else.\n\n415\n00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.560\nCan you guess what that is Jackie?\n\n416\n00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.180\n&gt;&gt; My forest.\n\n417\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.220\n&gt;&gt; Your forest, right.\n\n418\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.330\nWe also create a forest.\n\n419\n00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.140\nBecause you have to have a forest\nthe forest is the outer container\n\n420\n00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.160\nfor the domain.\n\n421\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.210\nThe forest actually gets its\nname from the first domain.\n\n422\n00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.040\nLet's send this guy to the back and\nsee if we can jump on this guy.\n\n423\n00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.540\nI'm going to copy and paste that.\n\n424\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.520\nSo the forest name,\nactually comes from the very first domain.\n\n425\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.950\nNow once we have this domain, we can do\na few things, I can have a little server.\n\n426\n00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:58.480\nLet's send this guy to the back, sorry my\ndrawing is kind of Goofing up on me here.\n\n427\n00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.450\n&gt;&gt; You know what's kind of interesting,\nMike?\n\n428\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.170\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n429\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.055\n&gt;&gt; So I told you I was learning about\nforestry over the weekend, right?\n\n430\n00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:05.400\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n431\n00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.490\nit's kind of neat when you think about it.\n\n432\n00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.450\nI was dealing with botanists and\nmaster gardeners and arborists.\n\n433\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:16.500\nThey're really, really smart, intelligent\npeople but I didn't know that trees\n\n434\n00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.560\ncan communicate throughout the forest,\nand they even actually have mother trees.\n\n435\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.460\nThey can spread and\nincrease carbon production\n\n436\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:31.320\non other trees as well to help them in the\nevent of any kind of harmful situation.\n\n437\n00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.680\nSo its almost like our domain\ncontrollers are like our mother tree,\n\n438\n00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.570\nit's like our forest.\n\n439\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.550\nI know it's kind of like weird, but it is,\n\n440\n00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.590\nthey all kind of interconnect and\ncommunicate.\n\n441\n00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.920\n&gt;&gt; I see that, yeah absolutely.\n\n442\n00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.820\nAlright, so we have created our domain\nwhich in turn creates a forest.\n\n443\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.310\nNow at this point, I have a domain and\n\n444\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.700\nthen it's just a matter of\njoining computers to that domain.\n\n445\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.210\nWe have established the domain,\n\n446\n00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.990\nthe trust, we then can start\nadding computers to that domain.\n\n447\n00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.400\nWe could when we create this domain\nwe could also add additional domain\n\n448\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.680\ncontrollers, to the domain.\n\n449\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.230\nYou always want to lease to the main\ncontrollers per site to per domain\n\n450\n00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.010\nreally to the main floor Perceval talk\nabout that concept here just a minute.\n\n451\n00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.420\nSo once I have a domain I can add\nto shuttle to make controllers for\n\n452\n00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.250\nfault tolerance right if one goes down.\n\n453\n00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:22.070\nThe other one's still there and\neverything continues to work, alright.\n\n454\n00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.820\nI can also create another\ndomain within my forest.\n\n455\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:30.370\nWe could take that and\ntake another server, and\n\n456\n00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:35.190\nmake another domain within my forest,\nso when you install active directory,\n\n457\n00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.560\nwe're gonna need to make a decision.\n\n458\n00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.020\nWe need to know what we're\ngetting ready to do.\n\n459\n00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:44.340\nAre we adding a domain controller,\nare we starting out from scratch and\n\n460\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.780\ncreating the domain and the forest.\n\n461\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.620\nOr are we adding a domain\ncontroller to an existing domain.\n\n462\n00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.110\nOr are we creating a new domain\nwithin an existing forest.\n\n463\n00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.330\nNow the wizard we're gonna go through\nis gonna ask me that very question, and\n\n464\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.010\nnow hopefully you're gonna have\nan idea of what it's asking you.\n\n465\n00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:05.150\nAnd remember too, when you're\ncreating new domains within a forest,\n\n466\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:12.390\nyou're either gonna be creating a new tree\nor a child domain in an existing tree.\n\n467\n00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.820\nRemember what that's all\nabout when we talk about DNS.\n\n468\n00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.150\nFor example, I might have\nsomething that looks like this\n\n469\n00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:24.600\nwhere the second domain that I just\nadded doesn't share the same namespace.\n\n470\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.800\nSo maybe this domain is I don't know,\n\n471\n00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.340\nlet's call it something like a test.com,\nright?\n\n472\n00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:39.000\nSame forest, same overall administration,\nbut a different namespace.\n\n473\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.310\nOr I might add a domain that's\na child of an existing domain.\n\n474\n00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:48.900\nSo it would look more like this,\nwhere we have a tree.\n\n475\n00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.260\nOops.\n\n476\n00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.681\nAnd get that to lock on there.\n\n477\n00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:02.766\nIn this case that child domain would\nshare the parent name space Right?\n\n478\n00:24:02.766 --> 00:24:08.329\nIt would be something like child.itpro.tv.\n\n479\n00:24:08.329 --> 00:24:11.440\nSo when you're adding a new\ndomain to an existing forest,\n\n480\n00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.053\nyou've got one additional\nquestion to answer.\n\n481\n00:24:14.053 --> 00:24:16.645\nIs this going to be a new\ntree in the forest,\n\n482\n00:24:16.645 --> 00:24:21.482\nor is it going to be part of an existing\ntree, a child domain of an existing tree?\n\n483\n00:24:21.482 --> 00:24:22.776\nAnd it's all a matter of whether or\n\n484\n00:24:22.776 --> 00:24:24.881\nnot it's sharing that\ncontiguous namespace, right?\n\n485\n00:24:24.881 --> 00:24:27.316\nDoes the name build on an existing domain?\n\n486\n00:24:27.316 --> 00:24:32.184\nAll right, so hopefully that gives us\na good idea of domain functional level,\n\n487\n00:24:32.184 --> 00:24:33.827\nforce functional level.\n\n488\n00:24:33.827 --> 00:24:37.920\nWe know now some of the questions\nthat are gonna pop up in the wizard.\n\n489\n00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.272\nI guess we should probably go take\na look at it and start installing.\n\n490\n00:24:41.272 --> 00:24:42.941\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwe've got a little bit of time left,\n\n491\n00:24:42.941 --> 00:24:44.961\ndo you think you want to go ahead and\nget that going, Mike?\n\n492\n00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:46.505\n&gt;&gt; I do, well, it's.\n\n493\n00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:49.106\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We're like\nrolling the die here.\n\n494\n00:24:49.106 --> 00:24:50.214\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what,\n\n495\n00:24:50.214 --> 00:24:52.817\nsince we've only got a little big of time\nleft, let's do a little more lecture,\n\n496\n00:24:52.817 --> 00:24:54.412\nwe'll just get all of\nthe lecture out of the way.\n\n497\n00:24:54.412 --> 00:24:56.871\nAnd then we can come back and\ndo a full on-\n\n498\n00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:59.018\n&gt;&gt; Demonstration, okay, I like it.\n\n499\n00:24:59.018 --> 00:25:01.962\n&gt;&gt; Although now I have nothing to talk\nabout with the little bar going across.\n\n500\n00:25:01.962 --> 00:25:03.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll figure it out.\n\n501\n00:25:03.875 --> 00:25:05.731\n&gt;&gt; We will figure it out,\nwe can talk about it.\n\n502\n00:25:05.731 --> 00:25:07.230\n&gt;&gt; We are never at a lack for words, yeah.\n\n503\n00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.623\n&gt;&gt; One more thing that I want to talk\nabout then, while we're on the subject,\n\n504\n00:25:11.623 --> 00:25:14.926\nor learning about this,\nis something known as Adprep.\n\n505\n00:25:14.926 --> 00:25:18.143\nAll right, A-D-P-R-E-P,\nall one word, Adprep,\n\n506\n00:25:18.143 --> 00:25:20.561\nshort for Active Directory Preparation.\n\n507\n00:25:20.561 --> 00:25:26.749\nIn the past, when we would install\na new operating system into our domain.\n\n508\n00:25:26.749 --> 00:25:31.372\nWe would need to prepare the environment\nrunning a tool from Microsoft on\n\n509\n00:25:31.372 --> 00:25:34.348\nthe installation media for Server 2008.\n\n510\n00:25:34.348 --> 00:25:38.787\nAnd at this time, 2008, that we are\nprepared, because Active Directory had no\n\n511\n00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:41.739\nidea about these new features\ngetting ready to come in.\n\n512\n00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:46.094\nLet's say we had a 2003 domain,\nall of the domain controllers are 2003.\n\n513\n00:25:46.094 --> 00:25:49.740\nWe're getting ready to install\nour first 2008 domain controller.\n\n514\n00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:55.033\nI would run something known as Adprep to\nprepare the Active Directory database for\n\n515\n00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:56.730\nnew attributes, right?\n\n516\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:01.347\nYou think about like a user account\nhas attributes, first name, last name,\n\n517\n00:26:01.347 --> 00:26:04.988\nphone number, department,\npassword, all those things.\n\n518\n00:26:04.988 --> 00:26:07.791\nWith this new version of\nActive Directory coming in,\n\n519\n00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:11.794\n2008 in this case, it has new attributes,\nI need to update the schema.\n\n520\n00:26:11.794 --> 00:26:15.050\nI need to update\nthe Active Directory environment.\n\n521\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.124\nSo that these 2003 machines,\nwhich have never seen this new attribute,\n\n522\n00:26:19.124 --> 00:26:21.327\nwill know what it is, and go, okay.\n\n523\n00:26:21.327 --> 00:26:25.797\nThat's not some mistake,\nlet's get everybody ready for that.\n\n524\n00:26:25.797 --> 00:26:27.200\nAnd that's what Adprep did.\n\n525\n00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.556\nThere was Adprep forest prep,\nAdprep domain prep,\n\n526\n00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:35.618\nAdprep GP prep, for\ngroup policy preparation.\n\n527\n00:26:35.618 --> 00:26:39.398\nAnd RODC prep for\nread only domain controllers.\n\n528\n00:26:39.398 --> 00:26:42.309\nIt's important to understand\nwhich ones we need to run,\n\n529\n00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:43.834\nwho we need to be logged on as.\n\n530\n00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:47.502\nWhere we need to run them,\nbut I will tell you this.\n\n531\n00:26:47.502 --> 00:26:53.150\nIn 2012, brand new to 2012,\n2012 R2 runs it automatically.\n\n532\n00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.371\nWhen you go to install your\nfirst 2012 domain controller,\n\n533\n00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:00.091\nit's going to say, the environment\nhasn't been prepared for me.\n\n534\n00:27:00.091 --> 00:27:02.789\nAnd it will automatically run\nthese tools in the background.\n\n535\n00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:04.947\nSo honestly, for 2012 R2,\n\n536\n00:27:04.947 --> 00:27:09.276\nyou don't need to know this unless\nsomething goes wrong, right?\n\n537\n00:27:09.276 --> 00:27:12.777\nOr unless you're logged on with a user\nthat doesn't have the rights to do this,\n\n538\n00:27:12.777 --> 00:27:14.411\nand that could very well be the case.\n\n539\n00:27:14.411 --> 00:27:19.184\nWhere I can install this domain\ncontroller, but I can't run forest prep,\n\n540\n00:27:19.184 --> 00:27:21.396\ncuz I'm not an enterprise admin.\n\n541\n00:27:21.396 --> 00:27:25.297\nSo that step would fail if it tried to\nrun it automatically in the background.\n\n542\n00:27:25.297 --> 00:27:29.752\nSo while we don't have to do it manually\nanymore, I think at this point,\n\n543\n00:27:29.752 --> 00:27:31.661\nwe still need to be aware of it.\n\n544\n00:27:31.661 --> 00:27:33.903\nAnd so,\nI just wanna go over that real quick,\n\n545\n00:27:33.903 --> 00:27:36.742\nAdprep forest prep prepares\nthe entire forest, right?\n\n546\n00:27:36.742 --> 00:27:41.817\nThe entire forest, so any time we do\nsomething that affects the entire forest,\n\n547\n00:27:41.817 --> 00:27:43.647\ndomain admin is not enough.\n\n548\n00:27:43.647 --> 00:27:47.505\nI know a lot of times we're used to\nthinking domain admin is the super user,\n\n549\n00:27:47.505 --> 00:27:48.681\nthere is none higher.\n\n550\n00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:52.871\nWell, domain admin's writes\nend at the domain partition or\n\n551\n00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:56.169\nat the domain boundary,\nnot out to the forest.\n\n552\n00:27:56.169 --> 00:27:58.254\nSo to do the Adprep forest prep,\n\n553\n00:27:58.254 --> 00:28:01.742\nwe need to be a member of\nthe enterprise admins group.\n\n554\n00:28:01.742 --> 00:28:04.782\nThat means we need enterprise-wide\nadministrative rights.\n\n555\n00:28:04.782 --> 00:28:06.696\nWe're also modifying the schema, and\n\n556\n00:28:06.696 --> 00:28:09.658\nI'm sure we've talked about\nthe schema in other episodes.\n\n557\n00:28:09.658 --> 00:28:12.918\nThe schema is the blueprints for\nthe objects in Active Directory.\n\n558\n00:28:12.918 --> 00:28:16.652\nAnd to write to the schema, you have to\nbe a member of the schema admins group,\n\n559\n00:28:16.652 --> 00:28:19.361\neven the enterprise admins\ncan't write to the schema.\n\n560\n00:28:19.361 --> 00:28:22.121\nThey're not in the schema\nadmins group by default, so\n\n561\n00:28:22.121 --> 00:28:25.847\nyou have to be in the enterprise admins\ngroup and the schema admins group.\n\n562\n00:28:25.847 --> 00:28:27.580\nAnd the domain admins group for\n\n563\n00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.919\nthe domain you're running it\nin to run Adprep forest prep.\n\n564\n00:28:30.919 --> 00:28:34.618\nSo you really have to be in every\nsuper group there is to run this.\n\n565\n00:28:34.618 --> 00:28:38.465\nYou only run it once, and it doesn't\nmatter what domain you run it from.\n\n566\n00:28:38.465 --> 00:28:42.219\nIf you had a forest with three domains\nin there, you could go to any domain.\n\n567\n00:28:42.219 --> 00:28:45.736\nAs long as you remember the enterprise\nadmins, the schema admins and\n\n568\n00:28:45.736 --> 00:28:48.200\nthat particular domain admins to do it.\n\n569\n00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.686\nI take that back.\n\n570\n00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:53.114\nYou have to be on the schema admin,\nyou have to be on the schema\n\n571\n00:28:53.114 --> 00:28:55.883\ninfrastructure master\nwhen you run this cache.\n\n572\n00:28:55.883 --> 00:28:58.448\nIt's been so long since I actually\nran this, and there's a whole,\n\n573\n00:28:58.448 --> 00:29:00.205\nI don't have enough time to this,\nCherokee.\n\n574\n00:29:00.205 --> 00:29:01.630\nThere's a whole another topic out there.\n\n575\n00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.861\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's okay, Mike.\n\n576\n00:29:02.861 --> 00:29:06.519\n&gt;&gt; How do I know which one is\nthe schema infrastructure master?\n\n577\n00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:09.312\n&gt;&gt; Well, the good news, Mike,\nis that we're not in a shortage,\n\n578\n00:29:09.312 --> 00:29:11.076\nwe don't have to pay for film anymore.\n\n579\n00:29:11.076 --> 00:29:15.006\nEverything is digital nowadays, so we can\njust keep going here with these episodes.\n\n580\n00:29:15.006 --> 00:29:15.888\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n581\n00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:16.908\n&gt;&gt; So that's the good news.\n\n582\n00:29:16.908 --> 00:29:20.914\nBut, the bad news is,\nwe are out of time for this show.\n\n583\n00:29:20.914 --> 00:29:23.834\nSo I don't want to be a Debby downer,\nbut we can come back, yeah.\n\n584\n00:29:23.834 --> 00:29:24.344\n&gt;&gt; I talk too much.\n\n585\n00:29:24.344 --> 00:29:29.080\nAll right, when we come back, I promise\nwe're going to talk about Adprep,\n\n586\n00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.781\nas well as locating those\ninfrastructure master holders.\n\n587\n00:29:32.781 --> 00:29:34.576\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like a plan.\n\n588\n00:29:34.576 --> 00:29:36.223\nWe're going to make sure\nthat that happens, so\n\n589\n00:29:36.223 --> 00:29:37.381\nthank you so much for joining us.\n\n590\n00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:40.839\nBut for this show, we'll go ahead and sign\nout, I've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n591\n00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:41.780\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n592\n00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.566\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n593\n00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:50.950\n[MUSIC]\n\n594\n00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.842\n&gt;&gt; Thank you

00:00:08.235\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:11.808\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:15.640\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to your 70-410 series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.420\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.940\nSo this is actually a part two, a\ncontinuation, where we were looking at and\n\n8\n00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.880\ntalking about installing\ndomain controllers.\n\n9\n00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.470\nAnd we did a whole lot of talking,\na little less looking, but in this show,\n\n10\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.315\nI think we're gonna be\npicking right back up, and\n\n11\n00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:30.935\nthen continuing on with that process.\n\n12\n00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:35.075\nAnd of course, we have Mr. Mike Rodrick\nback in studios with us today.\n\n13\n00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:36.085\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n14\n00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:36.715\n&gt;&gt; It's going good.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:37.837\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, I won't talk as much\n\n16\n00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.972\nthis time and we'll actually\nget to doing something, right?\n\n17\n00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:41.764\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, it's all good\ninformation so we're cool with that.\n\n18\n00:00:41.764 --> 00:00:42.973\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, it is.\n\n19\n00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:45.527\n&gt;&gt; And it's information we're\ngonna get tested on, right,\n\n20\n00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:46.710\nif we wanna get certified.\n\n21\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.942\nSo we do need to know it.\n\n22\n00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:54.236\nI think, at the end of that last episode,\nI was talking about operations masters.\n\n23\n00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:59.912\nAnd I think I said schema infrastructure\nmaster which is the blending of two.\n\n24\n00:00:59.912 --> 00:01:03.260\nI don't know where that came from so just\nmaybe make sure everybody understands.\n\n25\n00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.060\nWe'll talk about the five operations\nmasters once we get to an existing domain\n\n26\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.890\nso I'm gonna put that off.\n\n27\n00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.570\nBut the five operations masters, the\nschema master, your infrastructure master,\n\n28\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.405\nyour domain naming master,\nyour RIT master, and your PDC emulator,\n\n29\n00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:18.515\nthose are the five.\n\n30\n00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:20.679\nThere is no schema infrastructure master.\n\n31\n00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:21.840\nThose are two separate rules.\n\n32\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.710\nThey do two completely different things.\n\n33\n00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.511\nSo don't blend those in your mind-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n34\n00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:26.511\n&gt;&gt; Like I did.\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n35\n00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:27.089\n&gt;&gt; It does not work.\n\n36\n00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:30.699\n&gt;&gt; But we need to clarify, but yeah, we\nknow what you're talking about here, Mike.\n\n37\n00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:32.782\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's see.\n\n38\n00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:33.889\nWe're going to start.\n\n39\n00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:38.857\nSo we were talking about, let me find\nthe actual domain controller we're\n\n40\n00:01:38.857 --> 00:01:41.429\ngoing to be working on here, here we go.\n\n41\n00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.752\nYou know we're talking\nabout functional levels,\n\n42\n00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:46.920\nI think we got that out of the way.\n\n43\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.030\nWe're talking about 80 prep and how we\nneed to run that but we don't really\n\n44\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.300\nneed to run it anymore because 2012 R2\nwill do it for us in the background.\n\n45\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.280\nBut I do think that it's worth noting,\nmaking sure we understand what it is\n\n46\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.130\ncuz if it doesn't work,\nwe might have to troubleshoot this.\n\n47\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.450\nAnd as I said in that previous episode,\nwhen we're bringing a new\n\n48\n00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.452\noperating system in, we prepare\nthe environment using these commands.\n\n49\n00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:14.480\nThere's forestprep,\nthat's gonna be run once per forest.\n\n50\n00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.440\nSo, let's say we have five domains.\n\n51\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.755\nAll five domains are running 2008,\nour two domain controllers.\n\n52\n00:02:19.755 --> 00:02:23.428\nIn one of those domains, they get\nsome extra money in their budget, and\n\n53\n00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:26.873\nthey want to upgrade or\nbring in a 2012 R2 domain controller.\n\n54\n00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:30.025\nSo we're gonna have to run\n80 prep forestprep, but\n\n55\n00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:34.299\nthat preps the entire forest, so\nif another one of those domains wants to\n\n56\n00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.380\nbring in a 2012 R2 domain controller,\nthey do not have to run forestprep again.\n\n57\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.730\nSo 80 prep forestprep is run once and\nis run from the schema master.\n\n58\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.880\nThere's only one domain controller in the\nentire forest that is your schema master.\n\n59\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.992\nSo you must find it, and\nthat's where you have to run that command.\n\n60\n00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:56.610\nBecause forestprep is doing just that,\nit's modifying the schema to support\n\n61\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.550\nthe new definitions of objects and active\ndirectory, and a few other things, right?\n\n62\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.020\nAnd I'll show you how to find that once we\nget a domain controller up and running,\n\n63\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.069\nwe have some stuff to work with.\n\n64\n00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:11.619\nAdprep/domainprep is gonna be run\non the infrastructure master.\n\n65\n00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.508\nThe infrastructure master's\nanother one of those FSMOs,\n\n66\n00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:16.364\nFlexible Single Master Operations.\n\n67\n00:03:16.364 --> 00:03:21.273\nThere's one per domain, so you must find\nit and run it on that domain controller\n\n68\n00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:24.876\nbefore you bring in your\n2012 R2 domain controller.\n\n69\n00:03:24.876 --> 00:03:26.960\nThis is run once per domain.\n\n70\n00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.910\nThis is modifying the domain and\nonly that domain.\n\n71\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.540\nAll right?\n\n72\n00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.600\nSo, if a second domain wants to bring\nin a 2012 domain controller, they don't\n\n73\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.310\nhave to run forestprep because I already\nran it in my domain for the entire forest.\n\n74\n00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.900\nBut they will have to run domain\nprep because I did not run it.\n\n75\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.520\nThat has to be run on a per domain basis.\n\n76\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.701\nOnce per domain, if I bring in\nthe second 2012 domain controller,\n\n77\n00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.035\nI don't have to run it again.\n\n78\n00:03:50.035 --> 00:03:55.379\nBut it will be running once per domain for\nthe first 2012 R2 domain controller.\n\n79\n00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.283\nThen there's 80 prep, domain prep, GP prep\nand GP, group policy prep does just that,\n\n80\n00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:04.779\nit actually update some of\nthe access control list for\n\n81\n00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:09.596\ngroup policies as they're replicating\nfrom domain controller to domain\n\n82\n00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:14.130\ncontroller to support RODC's and\nsome other things.\n\n83\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.520\nAgain, once per domain, we have to run\nthat, if you run 80 prep GP prep without\n\n84\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.190\nrunning AD prep domain prep, it'll run\ndomain prep first and then run GP prep.\n\n85\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.000\nThey have to be run in that order, first\ndomain prep and then group policy prep.\n\n86\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, so you mentioned for\nour ODC prep, what does that entail?\n\n87\n00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.080\n&gt;&gt; That's the last one and\nthis one's an optional one.\n\n88\n00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.930\nIf you plan on installing a read-only\ndomain controller, just new capability,\n\n89\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.710\nright we can run 80 prep/ RODC prep and\n\n90\n00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.640\nthat'll prepare the environment for\nread-only domain controllers.\n\n91\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.560\nBut that one's optional.\n\n92\n00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.990\nYou don't have to run that just to install\na normal 2012 R2 domain controller,\n\n93\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.700\nonly if you need to create\na read-only domain controller.\n\n94\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.285\nAnd you can even do it later, like you\nmight run forestprep, domain prep and\n\n95\n00:05:03.285 --> 00:05:06.759\nGP prep, just to get your new domain\ncontroller installed and then a month\n\n96\n00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.401\nlater, go you know what, I wanna try\nthese read-only domain controllers,\n\n97\n00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:12.779\nI think that would work\ngood at the branch office.\n\n98\n00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:17.519\nAnd you can turn around and\nrun RODC prep at a later time.\n\n99\n00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.527\nThe domain prep and GP prep because\nyou're only affecting your domain,\n\n100\n00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:23.900\nyou don't have to be an enterprise admin.\n\n101\n00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.690\nBut you do need to have domain\nadmin rights within that domain and\n\n102\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.455\nit has to be run on the infrastructure\nmaster within that domain.\n\n103\n00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:32.695\nBut you have to know which one it is.\n\n104\n00:05:32.695 --> 00:05:36.160\nRODC prep,\nyou can run from any machine, and\n\n105\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.770\nit does only have to be run\nonce per forest because it\n\n106\n00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.870\nupdates the entire forest to support\nread-only domain controllers.\n\n107\n00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.530\nIf it updates the entire forest what\ngroup do you think I have to be in to run\n\n108\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.830\nthat command?\n\n109\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.810\n&gt;&gt; Enterprise admin.\n\n110\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.870\n&gt;&gt; The enterprise admins cuz I'm\naffecting more than one domain so\n\n111\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.250\nit has to be an enterprise admin.\n\n112\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.620\nBut you can run it from anywhere, it\ndoesn't have to be on the schema master or\n\n113\n00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.580\nthe infrastructure master or\nanything like that.\n\n114\n00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.220\nAll right, now,\n\n115\n00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.020\nfinally, Mike's done babbling on\nabout all the stuff we need to know.\n\n116\n00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.690\nSo let's get in and actually do some work.\n\n117\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.940\nSo, what I've got here is just a default\n2012 R2, I should say default, but\n\n118\n00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.085\nit's an install.\n\n119\n00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:16.560\nI've updated like the times\nzone in the IP address and\n\n120\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.660\nstuff like that but it's just a work\ngroup, right, so it's a stand alone,\n\n121\n00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.730\nnothing server and\nwe are going to install active directory,\n\n122\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.170\nso we are going to click Add Rules and\nFeatures.\n\n123\n00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.743\nAnd we will click next three time,\nall right.\n\n124\n00:06:34.743 --> 00:06:36.669\nBecause it is the only\nserver in my list so\n\n125\n00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.607\nI am going to skip right\non by all of that.\n\n126\n00:06:38.607 --> 00:06:41.800\nAnd we are going to do active\ndirectory domain services.\n\n127\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.000\nCheck that little check\nmark in the wizard there.\n\n128\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.530\nAnd that pops up my dialogue box,\n\n129\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.830\ndo I want to include all of the management\ntools and the PowerShell modules?\n\n130\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.550\nAbsolutely.\n\n131\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.568\nSo I'm gonna click Add Features.\n\n132\n00:06:54.568 --> 00:07:00.736\nAnd then Next and Next and\nNext and Install.\n\n133\n00:07:00.736 --> 00:07:01.981\nAnd that was it.\n\n134\n00:07:01.981 --> 00:07:03.595\nNo it was.\n\n135\n00:07:03.595 --> 00:07:07.305\n[LAUGH]\nThat was almost all of it.\n\n136\n00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:12.135\nHonestly what we're doing right now\nis just installing the role, right?\n\n137\n00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:14.055\nWe're unpacking the binaries and\n\n138\n00:07:14.055 --> 00:07:16.682\neverything needed to\nmake a domain controller.\n\n139\n00:07:16.682 --> 00:07:19.712\nWhen this wizard finishes we\ndon't have a domain controller.\n\n140\n00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:21.242\nIt's just unpacking everything.\n\n141\n00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:22.984\nAnd that's why I went\nthrough there pretty quick.\n\n142\n00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:26.046\nYou can go back and\nread those informational screens.\n\n143\n00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:26.796\nThey're very good.\n\n144\n00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:28.302\nIt's got some good information on there.\n\n145\n00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:30.102\nBut we're not making any decisions yet.\n\n146\n00:07:30.102 --> 00:07:32.862\nWe're not choosing anything,\nsetting up a domain.\n\n147\n00:07:32.862 --> 00:07:36.738\nAll we're doing is unpacking the role so\nthat we can then turn around and\n\n148\n00:07:36.738 --> 00:07:41.147\nrun another wizard to actually configure\nactive directory and make our domain.\n\n149\n00:07:41.147 --> 00:07:45.935\n&gt;&gt; So, in this lab environment that you\nhave set up, I'm assuming you don't have\n\n150\n00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:49.589\nany preexisting DNS infrastructure or\nanything like that.\n\n151\n00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:50.725\nYou just a had a workgroup there.\n\n152\n00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:53.227\nSo, that's something we'll need to think\nabout too, when we're installing this?\n\n153\n00:07:53.227 --> 00:07:55.677\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and we're gonna talk about,\nwe've got a bunch of episodes.\n\n154\n00:07:55.677 --> 00:07:58.580\nWe're gonna deal with DNS,\ncuz it's a very important topic.\n\n155\n00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.205\nWhile we're waiting for\nthis wizard to go though, let's see, 63%?\n\n156\n00:08:02.205 --> 00:08:03.020\n64%.\n\n157\n00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Are you like,\ncalculating your time to talk right now?\n\n158\n00:08:05.123 --> 00:08:06.362\nIs that what's happening, Mike?\n\n159\n00:08:06.362 --> 00:08:10.463\n&gt;&gt; No, it's something that I've done\nthis wizard so many times that, and\n\n160\n00:08:10.463 --> 00:08:12.630\nit's not just the Active Directory.\n\n161\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.890\nWhen it's all of them,\ndo this as a test and\n\n162\n00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.895\nif you see something different, email me.\n\n163\n00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:18.040\nMike@itpro.tv.\n\n164\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.746\nWhen this bar hovers, when it stops\nmoving, hover your mouse over it, and\n\n165\n00:08:22.746 --> 00:08:27.768\nI would almost be willing to bet money\nthat it's either gonna be 63 or 64%.\n\n166\n00:08:27.768 --> 00:08:29.308\nIt just stops there every time.\n\n167\n00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.246\nI don't know why.\n\n168\n00:08:30.246 --> 00:08:32.058\nAnyway, I digress.\n\n169\n00:08:32.058 --> 00:08:34.808\nYou were asking me about DNS.\n\n170\n00:08:34.808 --> 00:08:38.874\nActive Directory and DNS are like this.\n\n171\n00:08:38.874 --> 00:08:40.171\n&gt;&gt; BFFs.\n\n172\n00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:40.866\n&gt;&gt; They are.\n\n173\n00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:43.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Active Directory relies on DNS to\n\n174\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.230\nfunction so you have to have it.\n\n175\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.790\nSo when you install Active Directory,\nyou actually install DNS as well.\n\n176\n00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.595\nNow you might already have DNS in your\ninfrastructure and you can use that but\n\n177\n00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:57.710\nthis will end up installing DNS.\n\n178\n00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.540\nAll right, so this wizard has finished.\n\n179\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.870\nWe are complete, and\n\n180\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.720\nright in the middle of it I get promote\nthis server to a domain controller.\n\n181\n00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.405\nI can click on that link.\n\n182\n00:09:06.405 --> 00:09:08.110\nIt's gonna launch another wizard, and\n\n183\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.540\nI'll start the process of actually\ncreating a domain controller.\n\n184\n00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.270\nI can also close this wizard.\n\n185\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.740\nAnd I could've closed it\neven while it was running.\n\n186\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.620\nIt would not stop\nthe unpacking of the roll.\n\n187\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.770\nAnd if I did close it,\nwalk away, eat lunch, come back.\n\n188\n00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.480\nHere's a little notification\nup here that says hey.\n\n189\n00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.290\nWe finished unpacking but you still need\nto actually make it a domain controller.\n\n190\n00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.850\nIt's not a domain controller yet.\n\n191\n00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.490\nSo I can click there, and\nthat will launch that wizard.\n\n192\n00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.770\nSo either way you go, the link in\nthe old wizard, the first wizard,\n\n193\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.360\nor the little notification, it's gonna\ntake you to this same wizard, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.290\nThis is the Active Directory Domain\nServices Configuration Wizard, and\n\n195\n00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.460\nthe first thing we have\nto do is make a decision.\n\n196\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.950\nSelect the deployment operation.\n\n197\n00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.880\nAnd this is why I lead off with\nsome of that information because\n\n198\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.190\nwe got to start making decisions.\n\n199\n00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.417\nAnd you can't get into this wizard and\ngo, hmm, I wonder, right?\n\n200\n00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:00.620\nThis stuff needs to be planned out.\n\n201\n00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.195\nSo, my first decision is, add a domain\ncontroller to an existing domain.\n\n202\n00:10:05.195 --> 00:10:08.090\nAdd a new domain to an existing forest.\n\n203\n00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.530\nThat would be the child or the new tree.\n\n204\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.480\nOr add a new forced.\n\n205\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.330\nWell in this case,\nI've got nothing, right.\n\n206\n00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.860\nIt's just that black area I've\ngot no domains, no force.\n\n207\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:21.765\nSo even though it gives me these options,\nthe only one that would work for\n\n208\n00:10:21.765 --> 00:10:26.055\nme is add a new force because I don't have\nan existing domain to join I don't have\n\n209\n00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:29.500\nan existing force to add a domain to,\nI have nothing.\n\n210\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.410\nSo create a new force.\n\n211\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.586\nAnd notice it doesn't\nask me the force name,\n\n212\n00:10:33.586 --> 00:10:35.772\nit says give me the root domain name,\nright?\n\n213\n00:10:35.772 --> 00:10:41.434\nBecause remember the force takes\nthe name from that first Domain [COUGH].\n\n214\n00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:45.010\nfor for the first domain is\nwhat I trying to say there.\n\n215\n00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.695\nAnd [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; What gonna name this thing?\n\n216\n00:10:46.695 --> 00:10:47.704\n&gt;&gt; What gonna call this guy?\n\n217\n00:10:47.704 --> 00:10:50.630\nIt was gonna be something different.\n\n218\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:55.598\nLet's do, I don't wanna conflict\nwith any other networks.\n\n219\n00:10:55.598 --> 00:10:58.390\nCorp.itpro.tv, right.\n\n220\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.790\nSo that'll be the name of my first domain,\nclick Next.\n\n221\n00:11:03.935 --> 00:11:06.810\nJust trying to think of some of my\nother little labs I've got running in\n\n222\n00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.710\nthe background here, and-\n&gt;&gt; It's good that you had put that,\n\n223\n00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.590\nbecause you saw that we have\nthat additional namespace there.\n\n224\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.330\nWe don't always just have to have\nthat single name, so to speak.\n\n225\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's a very common thing to do nowadays,\n\n226\n00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.870\nis to like ITPro.TV, there might\nnot actually be domain for that.\n\n227\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.645\nThat's just our public domain space,\nand our domain, or our root domain,\n\n228\n00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:34.253\nmight be something like Corp.ITPro.TV,\nor HQ.ITPro.TV, or something like that.\n\n229\n00:11:34.253 --> 00:11:36.850\nAll right, so\nnow we come to the second screen.\n\n230\n00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.770\nAnd here's our functional levels.\n\n231\n00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.780\nAnd take a look at my options here.\n\n232\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.360\nNotice that because I'm adding, well give\nit just a second it's still scanning.\n\n233\n00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.090\nYeah I got my bar going across here.\n\n234\n00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.252\nIt does default to 2012 R2.\n\n235\n00:11:50.252 --> 00:11:53.030\nIt wants me to be able to take\nadvantage of all the new features.\n\n236\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.370\nBut my environment then maybe\nthat's not appropriate.\n\n237\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:01.240\nMaybe I have some 2008 machines that I\nalso wanna make domain controllers out of.\n\n238\n00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.900\nSo I can't leave this here.\n\n239\n00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.054\nSo I can choose,\nnotice the lowest I can go is 2008,\n\n240\n00:12:06.054 --> 00:12:09.229\nI can't even get back to 2003 anymore,\nall right?\n\n241\n00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.510\n2008, 8 R2, 12, 12 R2.\n\n242\n00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.810\nIf I set my forest to 2012,\n\n243\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.780\nnotice my domain functional\nlevel list is only 12 or 12 R2.\n\n244\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.658\nBecause I cannot have a 2008 domain\nfunctional level within a 2012 forest\n\n245\n00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:27.366\nfunctional level, right.\n\n246\n00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:30.660\nRemember your domain set the lowest\nforest functional level.\n\n247\n00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:36.290\nSo if I change that to 20, let's change\nthis to eight, let's change this to eight.\n\n248\n00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.700\nAnd now, if I try to change this\nforest functional level to 2012,\n\n249\n00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.680\nnotice it changed my domain\nfunction level four.\n\n250\n00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.450\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you're not gonna\nhave a 2008 machine.\n\n251\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.207\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it says you can do that,\nyou can not do that.\n\n252\n00:12:47.207 --> 00:12:51.063\nOur leader 2012 R2,\nspecify domain controller capabilities,\n\n253\n00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:52.380\ndo I wanna install DNS?\n\n254\n00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.393\nNotice it checked,\n\n255\n00:12:53.393 --> 00:12:57.096\nthat is the default to include DNS on\nthe Active Directory installation.\n\n256\n00:12:57.096 --> 00:13:00.596\nI don't have to, I can uncheck\nthat if I already have DNS or\n\n257\n00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:03.850\na bind server if it's\nnot Microsoft solution.\n\n258\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.800\nMaybe I wanna use that.\n\n259\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.500\nSo I don't have to install DNS.\n\n260\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.790\nJust understand that\nit will scream at you.\n\n261\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.780\nActive Directory requires DNS.\n\n262\n00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.370\nGlobal catalog since this is the first\ndomain controller in my domain\n\n263\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.680\nin my forest, I have no choice I have\nto have a global catalog server.\n\n264\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.410\nWe'll talk a little bit\nmore about what that is and\n\n265\n00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:27.920\nwhy I want it in an upcoming episode,\nbut I cannot uncheck that.\n\n266\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.250\nI cannot check RODC,\nread only domain controller.\n\n267\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.580\nYou must have at least one\nwritable domain controller\n\n268\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.850\nin order to create a read\nonly domain controller.\n\n269\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.370\nI have to have at least one where\nI can write and make changes.\n\n270\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.040\nHow am I supposed to change a password?\n\n271\n00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.236\nHow am I supposed to create a new user if\nmy only domain controller is read-only?\n\n272\n00:13:46.236 --> 00:13:47.550\nThat's not gonna work out too well.\n\n273\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.350\nSo you have to have at\nleast one writeable.\n\n274\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.380\nAnd then you have to set your\nActive Directory restore mode password.\n\n275\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.170\nThis is the password we're gonna use\nto fix Active Directory if it fails.\n\n276\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.843\nWhen you install, we should have at\nthis point, A plus, net plus, and\n\n277\n00:14:01.843 --> 00:14:03.693\nsome basic server understanding.\n\n278\n00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:06.171\nAnd we know that we have\na local security manager,\n\n279\n00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:09.210\nwhere I can create local\naccounts on a machine.\n\n280\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.970\nIf I join that machine to the domain,\nI can still use local accounts and\n\n281\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.755\naccess local resources.\n\n282\n00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:19.228\nOr I can log on with a domain account and\naccess domain resources,\n\n283\n00:14:19.228 --> 00:14:21.570\nexcept for domain controllers.\n\n284\n00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:25.110\nWhen you create a domain controller,\nyou'll lose access\n\n285\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.480\nto the local security authority,\nthe SAM, the Security Account Manager.\n\n286\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.650\nYou don't use that anymore.\n\n287\n00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.360\nYou cannot log on to a domain\ncontroller using local accounts.\n\n288\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay Mike, so\nthis is definitely a password,\n\n289\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.210\na credential set that we don't\nwanna misplace or forget or lose.\n\n290\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.240\n&gt;&gt; Definitely not, because this\nis one that you're going to need.\n\n291\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.870\nAnd it really should be a good long,\nstrong password.\n\n292\n00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.150\nBecause I will tell you nobody remembers\nto go in and change this password.\n\n293\n00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.592\nSo make sure it's documented,\nand it is much longer and\n\n294\n00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:57.047\nstronger than what I'm typing in here now,\npassword.\n\n295\n00:14:57.047 --> 00:14:58.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I am not fluffy.\n\n296\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n297\n00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.200\nAll right, so we got that directory\nservices restore mode password set.\n\n298\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.060\nThis is a warning telling me a delegation\ncannot be created cause the authoritative\n\n299\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.160\nparent zone cannot be found.\n\n300\n00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.460\nThis is normal behavior in my environment.\n\n301\n00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.250\nI don't have Internet access, I'm not\nsetting this up for public consumption.\n\n302\n00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.878\nIt wants to reach out and\nmake sure it can point to the DNS server.\n\n303\n00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:21.412\nI'm making corp.itpro.tv.\n\n304\n00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:25.514\nIt wants to find the DNS server for\nITPro.tv, create that delegation, and\n\n305\n00:15:25.514 --> 00:15:27.560\nit can't, so it's warning me.\n\n306\n00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.820\nYou might or\nmight not see this in your environment,\n\n307\n00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.840\ndepending on if you have Internet access.\n\n308\n00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.840\nBut it's something that can be fixed post.\n\n309\n00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.820\nIt's definitely not something that'll\nstop you from going through this process.\n\n310\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.070\nAll right,\njust saying it can't do it automatically.\n\n311\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.020\nYou're gonna have to take\ncare of your DNS delegations.\n\n312\n00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.660\nAll right,\nthen it's gonna verify my NetBIOS name.\n\n313\n00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.660\nYes, we are still using net bios.\n\n314\n00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:54.384\nI think I've been saying since\nI started teaching 2003 server\n\n315\n00:15:54.384 --> 00:15:56.757\nthat we were gonna lose net bios.\n\n316\n00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:57.329\nThat was, what?\n\n317\n00:15:57.329 --> 00:15:58.907\n15 years ago?\n\n318\n00:15:58.907 --> 00:16:00.201\nYeah, still here.\n\n319\n00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:02.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's great for\n\n320\n00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.370\nlocal name resolution.\n\n321\n00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.810\nI mean, it gets the job done.\n\n322\n00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like IPv4.\n\n323\n00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.940\nI remember starting out there like,\n\n324\n00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.600\nyou have to know IPv6 right now\nbecause it's going away, right away.\n\n325\n00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.450\n&gt;&gt; Right now.\n\n326\n00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.230\n&gt;&gt; And we're still on IPv4.\n\n327\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it takes a while to get\nthese kinda changes through.\n\n328\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.640\nAll right, so NetBIOS name,\n\n329\n00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.890\nit's just gonna take the first 15\ncharacters of your domain name minus corp.\n\n330\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.940\nOnly four characters,\nso use the whole thing.\n\n331\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.080\nOtherwise it'll just truncate it.\n\n332\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.880\nYou're free to change it if you need to.\n\n333\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.910\nAll right, I'll click Next.\n\n334\n00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.220\nAnd then, we're gonna have the paths,\nthe default locations for\n\n335\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.120\nwhere it's gonna install\nActive Directory's components.\n\n336\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.570\nI've got my database,\nwhich is by default C: windows ntds.\n\n337\n00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.790\nAnd that's a folder, NTDS.\n\n338\n00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:47.190\nInside there,\nI will find a file called NTDS.dit.\n\n339\n00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.450\nThat's the actual Active Directory\ndatabase that we're gonna be creating.\n\n340\n00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.330\nAnd that's where it's going to create it.\n\n341\n00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.220\nLog files would go in that same location,\nC:WindowsNTDS.\n\n342\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.420\nAnd then we've got Sysvol,\n\n343\n00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.480\nwhich is something we use to\nreplicate between domain controllers.\n\n344\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.200\nIt's a folder that all domain\ncontrollers are going to replicate.\n\n345\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.765\nIt's where we store group policy and\nsome other things in there.\n\n346\n00:17:09.765 --> 00:17:12.850\nDefault location, ccolon,\nwindows, sysfault.\n\n347\n00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.600\nSo these are defaults,\nreally don't have any need to change them.\n\n348\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.170\nYou might want to move them for\nsome reason specific to your environment.\n\n349\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.050\nYou might want to separate the log files\nin the database on a different physical\n\n350\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.670\ndisk or something like that.\n\n351\n00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.170\nBut most the time we just leave\nthose guys in their default.\n\n352\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.090\nWe'll click Next.\n\n353\n00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.190\nAnd then I get to review all of my\ndecisions that I made during this wizard.\n\n354\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.610\nIf I don't like any of them, now is\nthe time to go back and change them.\n\n355\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.880\nI can jump back to a particular screen.\n\n356\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:45.590\nOr I can use my Forward and Back buttons\njust to understand what I just did.\n\n357\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.350\nIt now has to go through\nthe prereq check again because\n\n358\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.050\nI might have changed something, right?\n\n359\n00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.910\nSo it needs to update this.\n\n360\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.900\nAnd so it's showing me all my choices.\n\n361\n00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.020\nI can also View Script.\n\n362\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.430\nSo if I want to automate\nthis in the future,\n\n363\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.570\nwe can see what the PowerShell\ncommand is going to be.\n\n364\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.130\nNotice this one is install/addsforest.\n\n365\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.640\nThat's because I'm creating a forest.\n\n366\n00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.380\nThe very first domain controller,\nin the very first domain in my forest.\n\n367\n00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.300\nSo the command is actually\ninstall-addsforest.\n\n368\n00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:17.941\nNot the domain controller which is\nkinda odd, not domain controller.\n\n369\n00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:19.277\nWhich is kinda odd.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\n\n370\n00:18:19.277 --> 00:18:23.520\nthis is one that we might never or\nseldomly use in production.\n\n371\n00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, test environments,\nor like I said,\n\n372\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.480\nif you're fortunate to\nstart a new company.\n\n373\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n374\n00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.050\n&gt;&gt; Build the network from the ground up.\n\n375\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:33.881\nIf I was adding a domain\ncontroller to an existing domain,\n\n376\n00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:41.290\nit's gonna be install-adds domain\ncontroller instead of install-addsforest.\n\n377\n00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.830\nAnd then one of\nthe parameters would be what\n\n378\n00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.530\ndomain are you adding the additional\ndomain controller to?\n\n379\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:51.641\nIf you're creating a new domain in\nan existing forest, install-addomain.\n\n380\n00:18:51.641 --> 00:18:53.290\nNot domain controller.\n\n381\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.810\nThat creates a new domain within a forest,\nand\n\n382\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.530\nit'll create your first domain\ncontroller in that new domain.\n\n383\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.570\nSo three different commands.\n\n384\n00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.370\nI'll show you,\nI can go out to TechNet real quick and\n\n385\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.490\nshow you those commands if you want.\n\n386\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.310\nBut a great way to learn your PowerShell,\nright?\n\n387\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.470\nOr to start automating this\nprocess if you need to.\n\n388\n00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.470\nAll right, so we are good.\n\n389\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.520\nI like all my decisions.\n\n390\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.560\nWe're gonna click Next.\n\n391\n00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.730\nAnd now, it's gonna do the pre-req check.\n\n392\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:20.040\nIt's gonna go through and make sure that\nmy system meets all the requirements,\n\n393\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.730\nthat I've got everything in order.\n\n394\n00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.270\nAnd it'll give me a little\nreport once it finalizes this.\n\n395\n00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.760\nAnd it can go, like I said, I can stop,\nI can go back and fix things if I need to,\n\n396\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.320\nmake adjustments if I need to.\n\n397\n00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.910\nShouldn't take it too terribly long here.\n\n398\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.120\nWe'll get a couple of warnings.\n\n399\n00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.270\nOne will be about DNS, because we\nweren't able to create that delegation.\n\n400\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.580\nWe'll get a warning probably about some of\nthe security features in 2012 are a little\n\n401\n00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.710\nstronger than older operating systems,\nthey might lose compatibility.\n\n402\n00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.740\nSo, we'll let this go for just a second.\n\n403\n00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.590\nIt's thinking about it.\n\n404\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and life would be nice if we had\na wizard for life walk us through and\n\n405\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.210\ngive us some guidance, and\n\n406\n00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.190\nthen give us a page to make sure we\nwant to make all these decisions, right?\n\n407\n00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, wouldn't that be great?\n\n408\n00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.385\nWay back in third grade you\nget this little wizard, yeah.\n\n409\n00:20:06.385 --> 00:20:07.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Of course I'd make really\n\n410\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.644\nintelligent decisions in third grade.\n\n411\n00:20:09.644 --> 00:20:12.712\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanted to grow up and\nbe, I don't even know [LAUGH].\n\n412\n00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.608\nI always wanted to be a marine biologist.\n\n413\n00:20:14.608 --> 00:20:16.736\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, marine biologist.\n\n414\n00:20:16.736 --> 00:20:18.530\nI actually wanted to do that, too.\n\n415\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.736\nAll right, so here we go.\n\n416\n00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:21.867\nGot a little green check mark up here,\nwell,\n\n417\n00:20:21.867 --> 00:20:24.234\ntechnically a white check\nmark in a green circle.\n\n418\n00:20:24.234 --> 00:20:26.395\nAll prereq checks pass successfully.\n\n419\n00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:28.219\nClick Install to begin.\n\n420\n00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:31.868\nAnd I'll get those warnings,\nlike I said, about DNS and\n\n421\n00:20:31.868 --> 00:20:36.310\nabout my algorithms\n&gt;&gt; not being compatible with Windows NT.\n\n422\n00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.380\nBut we are okay with that, all right?\n\n423\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.290\nNotice what it says at the bottom.\n\n424\n00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.110\nIf you click Install,\n\n425\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.550\nthe server automatically reboots at\nthe end of the promotion operation.\n\n426\n00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.280\nThis is one of the few things that's\nleft that still requires a reboot.\n\n427\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.690\nAnd that's because we're\nchanging everything up, right?\n\n428\n00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.505\nWe're installing Active Directory.\n\n429\n00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:58.160\nAuthentication is now all gonna\nbe done through Active Directory.\n\n430\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.800\nSo it does need to reboot.\n\n431\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.630\nSo if you're doing this, and\n\n432\n00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.790\nI'll go ahead and click Install,\nwe can talk while it's going.\n\n433\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.750\nIf I was doing this on a remote machine,\nfor\n\n434\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:10.360\nexample, that's something I would have to\nkeep in mind, is it is gonna do a reboot.\n\n435\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.960\nAnd if something goes wrong, I might not\nphysically be able to touch that server.\n\n436\n00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.030\nSo can I contact somebody\nthat's near the server?\n\n437\n00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.260\nIs this in another office,\nanother town, another country?\n\n438\n00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.100\nWhat are the hours?\n\n439\n00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.830\nDo they have access?\n\n440\n00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.250\nYeah, so something you gotta think about.\n\n441\n00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.170\n&gt;&gt; Am I gonna be making a drive?\n\n442\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAm I driving in on Sunday?\n\n443\n00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.690\nWhat is the deal here?\n\n444\n00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.080\n&gt;&gt; And I think, is this one of those weird\nones where the actual restart now button\n\n445\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.730\npops behind the other windows?\n\n446\n00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.170\nSo you might be waiting, and?\n\n447\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.760\n&gt;&gt; I think it still comes on top.\n\n448\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.025\nWe'll see.\nIt'll say you're ready to be logged off.\n\n449\n00:21:41.025 --> 00:21:43.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you can click it or not, and\n\n450\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.340\njust wait for it to go away.\n\n451\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.236\nSo, I tell you what, this will take\nprobably two to three minutes depending\n\n452\n00:21:49.236 --> 00:21:52.650\non your server, your physical hardware.\n\n453\n00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:53.600\nSo we'll let it run.\n\n454\n00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.907\nWe come back, we'll see what happens\nwith our brand new domain controller.\n\n455\n00:21:58.239 --> 00:21:59.680\nAll right, so we've rebooted.\n\n456\n00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.850\nLet's log in and see what we've got.\n\n457\n00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:07.250\nWe'll go to log on screen, and you'll\nnotice that I'm logging on to our domain\n\n458\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.610\nthat we just created, corp/administrator.\n\n459\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.448\nRemember, there is no more\nlocal security account manager,\n\n460\n00:22:13.448 --> 00:22:15.093\nwe don't have access to it anyway.\n\n461\n00:22:15.093 --> 00:22:18.250\nSo you can't log on with a local account,\nonly domain accounts.\n\n462\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.190\nAnd in this case, there's only one so far.\n\n463\n00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.650\nWell, that's technically not true,\nbut one we're gonna use.\n\n464\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.770\nAll right, there we go.\n\n465\n00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.620\nWe are logged in.\n\n466\n00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.300\nSo I guess, Cherokee,\n\n467\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.990\nwe should probably now verify that\nActive Directory installed, right?\n\n468\n00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, so aside from just using the\nGUI here and looking under our tools or\n\n469\n00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.520\nvisually inspecting our Server Manager,\nwhat else can we do, Mike?\n\n470\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know if I'd say besides.\n\n471\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.831\nI'd say those are two\nvery good options for\n\n472\n00:22:41.831 --> 00:22:44.050\ndetermining whether this succeeded, right?\n\n473\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:48.520\nCuz it reboots, and you log back in, and\ndo I have a domain controller, or don't I?\n\n474\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.530\nDid it work?\n\n475\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.570\nAnd so let's start there.\n\n476\n00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:51.750\nLet's start with a real simple stuff.\n\n477\n00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And the first thing\n\n478\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.420\nyou'll see is that I do have\na ADDS listed over here.\n\n479\n00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.820\nActive Directory Domain Services.\n\n480\n00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.241\nAnd when I click on it,\neverything looks pretty good.\n\n481\n00:22:59.241 --> 00:23:01.620\nI've got a couple warnings down here.\n\n482\n00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:05.654\nBut no big red thing there,\nnothing telling me, my gosh, it's failed.\n\n483\n00:23:05.654 --> 00:23:07.190\nSo that's a good start.\n\n484\n00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.560\nThe fact that I have my ADDS\nlisted in Server Manager\n\n485\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.630\ntells me that it probably succeeded.\n\n486\n00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.118\nWe would also like Cherokee said,\nlook at all the new tools I have.\n\n487\n00:23:15.118 --> 00:23:19.093\nUsers in Active Directory, Users and\nComputers, Sites and Services,\n\n488\n00:23:19.093 --> 00:23:24.450\nAdministrative Center, domain's address,\netc., etc., Group Policy Management.\n\n489\n00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.202\nThese are all there because we chose\nto install those additional management\n\n490\n00:23:28.202 --> 00:23:29.029\ntools, right?\n\n491\n00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:32.140\nSo there's another good\nsign that it succeeded.\n\n492\n00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.990\nWe could open up Cherokee's favorite.\n\n493\n00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:35.470\nWe're gonna open up PowerShell.\n\n494\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.930\nAnd obviously, this is first time for-\n&gt;&gt; It's kinda funny because, yeah,\n\n495\n00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.440\nwe were talking about this before.\n\n496\n00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.428\nWell, we had a quick break because of rain\nhere, but we were kind of discussing if we\n\n497\n00:23:46.428 --> 00:23:51.565\nuse the get-windows feature to check on\nthis particular role that it's installed,\n\n498\n00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:54.807\nwhy aren't we using\nthe get-role commandlet here?\n\n499\n00:23:54.807 --> 00:23:55.926\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n500\n00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:56.892\nWhere is my get-role?\n\n501\n00:23:56.892 --> 00:23:57.927\n&gt;&gt; Just because it doesn't exist.\n\n502\n00:23:57.927 --> 00:23:58.621\n&gt;&gt; It does not.\n\n503\n00:23:58.621 --> 00:24:01.170\nNot.\n&gt;&gt; At least as of the recording of this\n\n504\n00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:01.684\nshow.\n\n505\n00:24:01.684 --> 00:24:03.925\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they'll hear us and\ngo maybe we should do that.\n\n506\n00:24:03.925 --> 00:24:05.713\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so there we go.\n\n507\n00:24:05.713 --> 00:24:10.780\nI did a get-Windows feature and\nlet's see what we've got.\n\n508\n00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.720\nLet me scroll back up to the top here.\n\n509\n00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:20.600\n[NOISE] And Active Directory Domain\nServices is listed as Installed.\n\n510\n00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.314\nSo we are good to go there.\n\n511\n00:24:22.314 --> 00:24:25.190\nThat's another, again,\nindicator that this has succeeded.\n\n512\n00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.360\nThe final thing I would do,\n\n513\n00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.728\nif I was really worried about it,\nis I would open up File Explorer.\n\n514\n00:24:31.728 --> 00:24:34.725\nAnd unless we changed\nthose default locations,\n\n515\n00:24:34.725 --> 00:24:36.998\nwe would still know where those are.\n\n516\n00:24:36.998 --> 00:24:41.070\nC:\\Windows\\NTDS, right?\n\n517\n00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:44.794\nAnd do I have an ntds.dit and\nall the associated files that go with it?\n\n518\n00:24:44.794 --> 00:24:46.889\nAnd sure enough, there is my database-\n&gt;&gt; Looking at those actual files.\n\n519\n00:24:46.889 --> 00:24:49.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthere's my Active Directory database, and\n\n520\n00:24:49.925 --> 00:24:52.438\nall the log files that\ngo with that database.\n\n521\n00:24:52.438 --> 00:24:53.280\nThat's good.\n\n522\n00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.761\nWe also should see SYSVOL,\nC:\\Windows\\SYSVOL, which is right there,\n\n523\n00:24:57.761 --> 00:25:01.051\nwhich is all the information\nthat my domain controllers\n\n524\n00:25:01.051 --> 00:25:06.034\nare replicating back and forth, group\npolicy, staging areas, things like that.\n\n525\n00:25:06.034 --> 00:25:09.439\nAnd so again, another indicator\nthat everything was successful.\n\n526\n00:25:09.439 --> 00:25:13.390\nI now have an up and\nfunctional domain controller.\n\n527\n00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.410\nAll the components seem to be there.\n\n528\n00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.690\nEverything is looking good.\n\n529\n00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:20.510\nSo that's it, we now have a domain that\nwe can start joining computers to.\n\n530\n00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.280\nAnd remember, in this case,\nwe have a very simple one.\n\n531\n00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.290\nRight, if I go back to our drawing,\n\n532\n00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:29.913\nwe'd have to get rid of\nall of this other stuff.\n\n533\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.870\nSo we'll get rid of all that and all that.\n\n534\n00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.840\nOops, we didn't wanna\nget rid of the forest-\n\n535\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.622\n&gt;&gt; The triangle.\n\n536\n00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:37.960\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we do have a forest.\n\n537\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.241\nLet's get rid of that and that.\n\n538\n00:25:40.241 --> 00:25:45.560\nAnd we created what, corp.itpro.tv.\n\n539\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.934\nAnd I do need to bring one\nof those triangles back.\n\n540\n00:25:48.934 --> 00:25:51.300\nSo we'll set that up there like such.\n\n541\n00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:55.180\nOops, we'll move that\ntriangle over a wee bit.\n\n542\n00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:01.492\nAnd we'll remember that my forest is\nactually the same as my root domain.\n\n543\n00:26:01.492 --> 00:26:06.136\nSo we're gonna have a forest called\ncorp.itpro.tv, and we have a domain called\n\n544\n00:26:06.136 --> 00:26:11.165\ncorp.itpro.tv with a single domain\ncontroller in it waiting for us to join.\n\n545\n00:26:11.165 --> 00:26:11.815\nSo there you go.\n\n546\n00:26:11.815 --> 00:26:13.505\nWe have done, and we've got more to do.\n\n547\n00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:16.885\nWe still wanna take a look at other\nways we can install Active Directory.\n\n548\n00:26:16.885 --> 00:26:22.480\nWe wanna look at adding an additional\ndomain controller to an existing domain.\n\n549\n00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.220\nWe'll talk about upgrading\na domain controller, and\n\n550\n00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:30.190\nwe need to look at Server Core,\nbecause Core is the up and coming,\n\n551\n00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.090\nis what they want us to run\na lot of our machines with.\n\n552\n00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:36.918\nAnd it's definitely gonna be\na testable item for sure.\n\n553\n00:26:36.918 --> 00:26:40.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, all of those things sound\ngreat because those are all real life\n\n554\n00:26:40.898 --> 00:26:42.868\nsituations that you may encounter.\n\n555\n00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:43.987\nSo you don't wanna miss that.\n\n556\n00:26:43.987 --> 00:26:47.400\nYou definitely wanna check us out for\nthat in particular, those upcoming shows.\n\n557\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.350\nBut Mike, thank you so much for your time.\n\n558\n00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.904\nAnd thank you for your time as well, but\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out for\n\n559\n00:26:52.904 --> 00:26:53.476\nthis show.\n\n560\n00:26:53.476 --> 00:26:54.880\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n561\n00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n562\n00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.365\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n563\n00:26:57.365 --> 00:27:04.640\n[MUSIC]\n\n564\n00:27:04.640 -->

00:00:04.980\n[CROSSTALK] Coming to you\nlive from San Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.685\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:08.326\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:10.845\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:16.079\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your 70-410 series,\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.847\nSo this is actually a part three,\na continuation of looking at different\n\n9\n00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:22.645\nways we can go ahead and\ninstall domain controllers.\n\n10\n00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:25.595\nAnd back with us today in studios,\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:27.521\nThanks for joining us today,\nMike, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:29.426\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:29.426 --> 00:00:31.623\nAnd yeah, kinda had to come back-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:31.623 --> 00:00:33.495\n&gt;&gt; To finish this long-winded conversation\n\n15\n00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:34.956\nwe are having about installing.\n\n16\n00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:35.723\n&gt;&gt; You're not gonna leave us hanging,\n[LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:36.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, we can't do that.\n\n18\n00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:38.179\nWe've got to get\nActive Directory installed,\n\n19\n00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:39.653\ngot to build up these domain controllers.\n\n20\n00:00:39.653 --> 00:00:44.430\nAll right, so, in our previous episodes,\nwe've laid all the foundation work,\n\n21\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.448\nwe've got all our knowledge set.\n\n22\n00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:50.234\nAnd we saw how to start from\nscratch with no domain, no forest.\n\n23\n00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:54.862\nAnd create our first domain controller,\nwhich therefore created our first domain,\n\n24\n00:00:54.862 --> 00:00:58.087\nwhich also created our forest,\nso we're good to go there.\n\n25\n00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:01.191\nBut we also said that that's not\nsomething we see that often, right?\n\n26\n00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:01.837\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n27\n00:01:01.837 --> 00:01:04.417\n&gt;&gt; In a lab environment, you're\nsetting up something like that, yes.\n\n28\n00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:06.328\nNormally, we go get a job and\n\n29\n00:01:06.328 --> 00:01:10.799\nwe are asked to maintain an existing\nnetwork, or adopt a network.\n\n30\n00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.928\nBut it's already there,\nwe didn't start from scratch.\n\n31\n00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:15.560\nSo, the next option I want to show you is,\n\n32\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.945\nhow do you add additional domain\ncontrollers to an existing domain?\n\n33\n00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.705\nSo, let's take a look at my screen here,\nand I have got a drawing set up.\n\n34\n00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:26.536\nSo, I have got a domain\ncurrently called lab.itpro.tv.\n\n35\n00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:30.019\nIn there,\nthere's already a domain controller, DC01,\n\n36\n00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:33.171\nand, of course,\nI have my forest, lab.itpro.tv.\n\n37\n00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.349\nAnd what we're going to do is\nwe're going to take a server.\n\n38\n00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:38.987\nI've got a server named Servo1, and\nwe're going to go ahead and promote him,\n\n39\n00:01:38.987 --> 00:01:40.954\nwe're gonna make it a domain controller.\n\n40\n00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:42.917\nAnd now that I use the word promote,\n\n41\n00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:46.728\nthat brings up another topic we\nshould probably touch on real quick.\n\n42\n00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:47.403\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n43\n00:01:47.403 --> 00:01:51.705\n&gt;&gt; Because anybody that's been doing this\na little while might remember dcpromo.\n\n44\n00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:55.370\nA command we would use to promote\ndomain controllers, right?\n\n45\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.551\nPromote a server to a domain controller,\nbasically, install Active Directory.\n\n46\n00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.440\nThat is no longer around.\n\n47\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.953\nIt is in Core,\nbecause we don't have the GUI.\n\n48\n00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:08.516\nBut the wizard you're seeing me using\nthrough Server Manager has really\n\n49\n00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:09.801\nreplaced dcpromo.\n\n50\n00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:13.839\nSo you won't see that as\nan option in Server 2012 R2.\n\n51\n00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.003\nAll right, so\nlet's see how we can go about this.\n\n52\n00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.621\nWe are gonna flip over to, so\nhere's my domain controller, right?\n\n53\n00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:22.362\n[COUGH] DC01.\n\n54\n00:02:22.362 --> 00:02:27.089\nAnd he's the domain controller for\nlab.itpro.tv, and\n\n55\n00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:32.020\nwere going to jump over to Server 1,\nwho is a member server.\n\n56\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.696\nIt is a part of the domain already,\nlab.itvpro.tv, but he's not running\n\n57\n00:02:36.696 --> 00:02:41.531\nActive Directory, he's not running\nanything, he is just getting started.\n\n58\n00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:44.821\nAnd if I opened up a command prompt,\nlet's just test that out,\n\n59\n00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:47.502\nI'm gonna run an administrative\ncommand prompt.\n\n60\n00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:56.349\nAnd we're gonna type in dcpromo,\nall right?\n\n61\n00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.018\nAnd there you go,\nthe Active Directory domain service\n\n62\n00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:01.697\ninstallation wizard is\nrelocated in Server Manager.\n\n63\n00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:05.204\nFor more information,\ngo click on this link.\n\n64\n00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:08.018\nSo dcpromo has disappeared,\nexcept for Core.\n\n65\n00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:10.805\nAll right, so,\nthat means we're not using dcpromo,\n\n66\n00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:14.150\nwe're going to be using Server Manager,\nwhich is where I am now.\n\n67\n00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.502\nI can go to the dashboard, and\nclick Add Rules and Features.\n\n68\n00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:20.844\nI can go to Manage, Add Rules and\nFeatures, either way,\n\n69\n00:03:20.844 --> 00:03:25.179\nit launches the same wizard, and\nwe're going to go ahead and click Next.\n\n70\n00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.447\nAnd you've seen me run\nthrough this wizard before,\n\n71\n00:03:28.447 --> 00:03:32.761\nso the first three screens are just\nwhat server am I installing it on.\n\n72\n00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:35.069\nThen I get to the Rules and\nFeatures screen, and\n\n73\n00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.776\nwe will choose Active Directory Domain\nServices, just like we did before.\n\n74\n00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:44.229\nI'll click Add Features, I'll click Next,\ndon't need any additional features.\n\n75\n00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.210\nGives me some great information\nthat you should take the time\n\n76\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.852\nto read about Active Directory.\n\n77\n00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:51.935\nI get my confirmation,\nand I click Install, so\n\n78\n00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:55.952\nno different than what we did\non our previous demonstration.\n\n79\n00:03:55.952 --> 00:03:58.119\nRemember, this isn't\ninstalling Active Directory.\n\n80\n00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:00.476\nThis is just unpacking the role and\n\n81\n00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:03.816\ngetting it ready to become\na domain controller.\n\n82\n00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:06.326\nSo that's why there's not a lot\nof decision making process there.\n\n83\n00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:09.900\nYes, that's the role I want, yes,\nI want to include management tools,\n\n84\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.813\nother than that, go ahead and finish.\n\n85\n00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:15.367\nIt's what comes afterwards,\nthat's where our skill set is involved.\n\n86\n00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:18.333\nThat's where the planning\nhas to be performed so\n\n87\n00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:21.818\nthat we can make the right\ndecisions in that next wizard.\n\n88\n00:04:21.818 --> 00:04:26.245\nSo I'll let this guy go, just a second,\nshouldn't take too much longer,\n\n89\n00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:30.407\nalthough Cherokee, I'm going to\npredict that it stops right there.\n\n90\n00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:32.657\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look, 64%, how about that?\n\n91\n00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:33.178\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n92\n00:04:33.178 --> 00:04:34.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:34.756 --> 00:04:36.554\n&gt;&gt; The things you do when you're bored.\n\n94\n00:04:36.554 --> 00:04:39.117\nThere's a study, I forget what they said,\n\n95\n00:04:39.117 --> 00:04:42.738\non how much time an IT person\nspends waiting on progress bars.\n\n96\n00:04:42.738 --> 00:04:47.537\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, well, here's the thing, it used\nto be, and I know it's kind of crazy if\n\n97\n00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.820\nyou think back,\nwhen you actually had physical boxes.\n\n98\n00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.787\nAnd you would go through and install\nthese, and I guess maybe not, per se,\n\n99\n00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:54.882\nwith domain controllers.\n\n100\n00:04:54.882 --> 00:04:58.161\nYou might not be installing that often,\nbut\n\n101\n00:04:58.161 --> 00:05:02.157\nespecially with reinstalls\nof regular end user PCs.\n\n102\n00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:04.991\nYou could just line them up on the work\nbench and go through and walk through.\n\n103\n00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:08.121\nEspecially with XP,\nwhere it had that interaction and\n\n104\n00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:11.736\nyou could do them in a row,\nalmost like a little assembly line.\n\n105\n00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:14.001\nBut nowadays, it's just, yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:14.578\n&gt;&gt; All of them.\n\n107\n00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:15.816\n&gt;&gt; You do have extra time on your hands.\n\n108\n00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:16.489\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n109\n00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:18.577\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Zero rush, yeah, we can go ahead and\n\n110\n00:05:18.577 --> 00:05:20.490\nget a sandwich,\nget some coffee, come back.\n\n111\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.520\nSo it's almost done, I promise,\nwe'll get it here in a second.\n\n112\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.348\nAnd then, of course,\nonce this finishes, you guys know,\n\n113\n00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:29.452\nbecause you watched the previous episode.\n\n114\n00:05:29.452 --> 00:05:31.631\nIt's gonna pop up, and\nI'm gonna have a link for\n\n115\n00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.514\npromote this server to a domain\ncontroller, like right there.\n\n116\n00:05:34.514 --> 00:05:36.383\nIf I want, I could close the wizard and\n\n117\n00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:39.903\nthen I could click on the little\nnotification and get to the same place.\n\n118\n00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:43.017\nSo, no domain controller yet,\nwe've just unpacked all the binaries,\n\n119\n00:05:43.017 --> 00:05:43.994\neverything it needs.\n\n120\n00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:46.686\nSo I'll click the link this time,\nwe'll go a different route.\n\n121\n00:05:46.686 --> 00:05:50.682\nThat does leave the other wizard\nbehind open, and if you're like me,\n\n122\n00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:51.570\nthat bugs you.\n\n123\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.092\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n124\n00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:54.353\nyou can always reach back there and\nclose it, it doesn't matter.\n\n125\n00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:57.262\nAll right, now this is where\nwe've got to make our decisions.\n\n126\n00:05:57.262 --> 00:06:02.247\nAnd it's the same one we saw prior, so\nthe last time we chose Add a new forest,\n\n127\n00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:05.797\nand it wanted my root domain name,\nthere's nothing.\n\n128\n00:06:05.797 --> 00:06:07.629\nSo I get to create\neverything from scratch.\n\n129\n00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.085\nNow we're going to be adding a domain\ncontroller to an existing domain.\n\n130\n00:06:11.085 --> 00:06:14.988\nAnd it wants to know then,\nwhat domain are you trying to add it to?\n\n131\n00:06:14.988 --> 00:06:19.085\nIn my forest, there's only one domain,\nso it's not that big of a decision.\n\n132\n00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:21.324\nBut in your forest,\nyou might have multiple domains, and\n\n133\n00:06:21.324 --> 00:06:24.078\nyou've got to know which one you're\nadding the domain controller to.\n\n134\n00:06:24.078 --> 00:06:29.026\nThe full name, not just lab,\nlab.itpro.tv, in my case.\n\n135\n00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:33.620\nIf I was adding a new domain\nto an existing forest, well,\n\n136\n00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.124\nthat changes my choices here.\n\n137\n00:06:36.124 --> 00:06:41.256\nAll of sudden, I need to know, well,\nis this a child domain or a tree domain?\n\n138\n00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:44.261\nNow remember I showed you in my drawing,\nit could be a subordinate or\n\n139\n00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:45.647\na child of an existing domain.\n\n140\n00:06:45.647 --> 00:06:48.327\nOr it could be a separate name space\nin my forest, it could be a tree.\n\n141\n00:06:48.327 --> 00:06:52.025\n&gt;&gt; Like that lateral movement or\nthat equal level of the hierarchy there.\n\n142\n00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:54.354\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because they don't have\na contiguous name space, so\n\n143\n00:06:54.354 --> 00:06:55.366\nthey are a separate tree.\n\n144\n00:06:55.366 --> 00:07:00.829\nAnd if I choose Child, well,\nwhat domain is the parent, right?\n\n145\n00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:03.205\nWhat one was it under with\nthat line we were showing?\n\n146\n00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:06.609\nCuz I might have multiple domains,\nand that could make a child of\n\n147\n00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:09.460\nany one of them, and\nthen what is the new domain name?\n\n148\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.930\nIf it's a new tree, well,\nit's not the child of anything.\n\n149\n00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.112\nSo just wants to know what\nis your new domain name and\n\n150\n00:07:16.112 --> 00:07:18.341\nwhat forest is it going in, right?\n\n151\n00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:23.240\nCredential wise, if you are creating\na new domain in an existing forest, well,\n\n152\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.195\nlet's start at the beginning.\n\n153\n00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.178\nIf you are creating a brand new\ndomain in a brand new forest,\n\n154\n00:07:28.178 --> 00:07:30.398\nthere's no credentials to check, right?\n\n155\n00:07:30.398 --> 00:07:32.289\nThere is nothing, so\nyou're starting it out, so\n\n156\n00:07:32.289 --> 00:07:34.324\nyou're going to have\nthe appropriate credentials.\n\n157\n00:07:34.324 --> 00:07:37.735\nYou just need the local admin\non the machine you are using.\n\n158\n00:07:37.735 --> 00:07:42.251\nIf you are adding a new domain to\nan existing forest, forest wide,\n\n159\n00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:44.443\nremember, we talked about it.\n\n160\n00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:48.498\nAnything that affects the entire forest\nis gonna be an enterprise admin.\n\n161\n00:07:48.498 --> 00:07:52.176\nSo in order to create a new\ndomain in an existing forest,\n\n162\n00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:54.933\nyou would need enterprise admin rights.\n\n163\n00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:59.744\nIf we're adding a domain controller to\nan existing domain, like we are here Now I\n\n164\n00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:03.944\nonly need domain admin rights,\ncuz I'm not messing with the forest.\n\n165\n00:08:03.944 --> 00:08:07.430\nEverything I'm doing is gonna be\ncontained within my domain, right?\n\n166\n00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.190\nSo that's the one I'm gonna choose.\n\n167\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.190\nI'm already currently logged on as\nsomebody that is a member of the domain\n\n168\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.570\nadmin's group.\n\n169\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.240\nIf I needed to change that,\nI could click Change.\n\n170\n00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.960\nWe'll click Next.\n\n171\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.221\nIt's gonna verify my credentials.\n\n172\n00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:24.100\nIt also has to check and\nsee if it can find the domain.\n\n173\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.020\nRight, make sure that it's reachable and\nlook for an existing domain controller.\n\n174\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.845\nIf it was a brand new domain\nin an existing forest,\n\n175\n00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:36.505\nwe'd have to verify that\nthe name wasn't in use already,\n\n176\n00:08:36.505 --> 00:08:39.885\nit actually uses the domain\nnaming master to do that.\n\n177\n00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.658\nHere we go, so\nwe have gone on to the next screen, well,\n\n178\n00:08:42.658 --> 00:08:45.850\nyou can still see that bar going\nacross there so it is verifying.\n\n179\n00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.250\nHere DNS is already selected\njust like before because it is\n\n180\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.240\nthe default active directory needs DNS.\n\n181\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.336\nBut in this case I've already got DNS so\ntechnically I could uncheck this and\n\n182\n00:08:58.336 --> 00:09:00.515\njust point it to an existing DNS server.\n\n183\n00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:04.300\nI'm gonna go ahead and leave it, I like my\ndomain controllers to also be DNS servers.\n\n184\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.890\nI can also uncheck local catalog which\nI wasn't able to do before when I\n\n185\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.740\nwas creating the first main\ncontroller in my first domain\n\n186\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.600\ncuz you have to have at least\none global catalog server.\n\n187\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.230\nIn my case, I've got an existing domain\nin an existing forest, and that first\n\n188\n00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.440\ndomain controller, the one that already\nexists is already a global catalog server.\n\n189\n00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.350\nSo I could uncheck this, right,\n\n190\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.730\nI don't have to have a second\nglobal catalog server.\n\n191\n00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.480\nI could also choose read-only\ndomain controller because remember,\n\n192\n00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.410\nI've already got a writable domain\ncontroller so now that is a viable option.\n\n193\n00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.320\nWe're not going to do that, though.\n\n194\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, previously you had stated we\nshould always have at least two domain\n\n195\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.380\ncontrollers.\n\n196\n00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.370\nWithin our environment, should we have two\nread and write domain controllers, and\n\n197\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.880\nthen subsequent domain\ncontrollers being that read only?\n\n198\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.960\n&gt;&gt; Basically yes.\n\n199\n00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.770\n&gt;&gt; Or do we skate by?\n\n200\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.671\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because if you have one read only,\nif you have a read write, and a read only,\n\n201\n00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:56.250\nand the read write fails.\n\n202\n00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.680\nThe read only can still function.\n\n203\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.450\nIt can still authenticate people.\n\n204\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.300\nBut it's only gonna have certain parts.\n\n205\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.740\nThere's a lot more to read\nonly domain controllers\n\n206\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.270\nthan what we've got time to discuss here.\n\n207\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.290\nBut they've only got access to a subset of\npasswords that we've chosen to replicate.\n\n208\n00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.310\nSo they might not be able\nto authenticate everybody.\n\n209\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.733\nMost likely hardly any, so yes, definitely\ntwo writable full blown domain controllers\n\n210\n00:10:18.733 --> 00:10:24.228\nis gonna be your- read only should not\nreally take the place of one of those.\n\n211\n00:10:24.228 --> 00:10:24.950\nDoes that make sense?\n\n212\n00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, site name,\n\n213\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.960\nwe're not gonna get into sites\nin this particular episode.\n\n214\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.310\nWe'll have a whole other one\nwhere we deal with those.\n\n215\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.570\nWe do need the DSRM password.\n\n216\n00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.040\nIt does not have to be the same\non all domain controllers.\n\n217\n00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.080\nThis is in a sense a local,\nnot in a sense, it is a local account,\n\n218\n00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.450\nthe only local account we still have\naccess to on domain controllers.\n\n219\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.490\nIt does not have to be the same\npassword on every domain controller.\n\n220\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.030\nI will tell you though, that in most\norganizations we find that we have one,\n\n221\n00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.730\ngood, long,\nstrong password that we use for DSRM and\n\n222\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:59.010\nwe use the same on all domain controllers.\n\n223\n00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.992\nIt just help with logistics, right?\n\n224\n00:11:00.992 --> 00:11:02.840\nI mean, what is the DSRM for\n\n225\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.550\nthis particular domain controller\nthat can become a challenge?\n\n226\n00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.454\nAnd I click Next and no DNS delegation,\n\n227\n00:11:09.454 --> 00:11:13.910\nwe talked about that the last time we went\nthrough the wizard, we'll click next.\n\n228\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.560\nAnd then we get to this screen here,\nadditional options and\n\n229\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.902\nI get this one for install from media.\n\n230\n00:11:19.902 --> 00:11:23.980\nAll right, we're gonna actually\ncome back to that in just a second.\n\n231\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.690\nSo, hold your questions about that.\n\n232\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.190\nBut I'm not going to select it.\n\n233\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.630\nAnd I'm gonna just keep on going.\n\n234\n00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.060\nThat screen wasn't even\nthere on the first wizard.\n\n235\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.520\nThe first time we ran through this.\n\n236\n00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.370\nBecause it was the first\ndomain controller.\n\n237\n00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.154\nSo I will explain what it means and\n\n238\n00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:40.230\nyou will go that makes sense\nwhy that wasn't there.\n\n239\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.290\nBut we will skip it for now.\n\n240\n00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.530\nAs we saw this screen,\nright, no difference here.\n\n241\n00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.510\nI get to review my options.\n\n242\n00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.430\nGo through my prereq checks and\nwe'd be good to go, all right.\n\n243\n00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.885\nSo most, the only real difference\nbetween add an existing versus\n\n244\n00:11:55.885 --> 00:11:59.619\ncreating a brand new was on\nthat first screen, right?\n\n245\n00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:03.785\nWhere I got to choose am I creating a new\none or am I adding it to an existing or\n\n246\n00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:06.339\nam I adding a new domain\nto an existing force,\n\n247\n00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:08.800\nthat was really the only difference.\n\n248\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.190\nAnd then I could uncheck global\ncatalogue if I wanted to.\n\n249\n00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.700\nOr I could select read only.\n\n250\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.560\nBut other than that the wizard\nwas exactly the same.\n\n251\n00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.480\nAll right, rather than click finish,\nI wanna go back and\n\n252\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.660\ntalk about these additional options.\n\n253\n00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.470\nBecause otherwise we just have to\ngo through this whole wizard again\n\n254\n00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.380\njust to get to the screen and I think\nyou've seen it enough at this point.\n\n255\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.870\nSo let's talk about this\ninstall from media options.\n\n256\n00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.090\nAnd before we can really talk\nintelligently about this, we have to\n\n257\n00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:42.070\nunderstand what's going on when we add\na domain controller to an existing domain.\n\n258\n00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.484\nWhen you created the first domain\ncontroller It's creating a blank copy of\n\n259\n00:12:46.484 --> 00:12:51.320\nthe Active Directory Database, NTDS.dit\nand it's throwing it in that folder,\n\n260\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.540\nSQL and Windows NTDS, right?\n\n261\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.700\nAnd that's it,\nwe're starting from scratch.\n\n262\n00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.300\nBut when you're adding a domain\ncontroller to an existing domain,\n\n263\n00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.690\nthat means Active Directory\nalready exists.\n\n264\n00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.295\n&gt;&gt; All those users,\nall those computers, all those records.\n\n265\n00:13:04.295 --> 00:13:08.560\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, if you're doing this,\nmaybe you're doing this all on a Saturday.\n\n266\n00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.640\nYou've set your first one up, and\nnow you're setting your second one up, but\n\n267\n00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.500\nmost likely you have an existing\ndomain that you want to\n\n268\n00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.300\nadd another domain controller to for\nfault tolerance, or to\n\n269\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.190\nreplace a domain controller that's getting\nremoved because the hardware's old.\n\n270\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.430\nSo the active directory database\nis already fully functional and\n\n271\n00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:28.340\nestablished, and as Cherokee said,\nthere's lots of objects in there.\n\n272\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.120\nSo when I create a new domain\ncontroller in an existing domain,\n\n273\n00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.590\nit's gonna create a blank copy\nof NTDS.DIT the database.\n\n274\n00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.600\nBut then it's gotta replicate\nall those existing objects\n\n275\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.870\nfrom an existing domain controller over\nto this brand new domain controller.\n\n276\n00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.310\nHe needs a copy of all the users and\ncomputers and printers, and\n\n277\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.390\ngroup policies.\n\n278\n00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.487\nAll the stuff that gets\nstored in Active Directory.\n\n279\n00:13:50.487 --> 00:13:55.037\nThat replication occurs automatically as\nsoon as I build up this domain controller\n\n280\n00:13:55.037 --> 00:13:58.677\nand he'll reach out and\ntalk to any existing domain controller and\n\n281\n00:13:58.677 --> 00:14:01.200\npull that information from it.\n\n282\n00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.670\nWhich you know, in a LAN, if I'm all on\na high speed LAN,maybe you don't care\n\n283\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.480\nabout that but there are gonna be\ntimes when that can cause a problem.\n\n284\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.860\nWhat if I've got a branch office?\n\n285\n00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.620\nAnd the connection between here and\nthe branch office is limited.\n\n286\n00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.150\nAnd I'm setting up a new domain\ncontroller at that branch office.\n\n287\n00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.540\nWell that means when I finish that wizard,\nit's gonna attempt to replicate the entire\n\n288\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.405\nactive directory database\nacross that WAN link.\n\n289\n00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:28.315\n&gt;&gt; My gosh,\ncould you imagine in remote areas,\n\n290\n00:14:28.315 --> 00:14:31.070\nand you don't have that good bandwidth?\n\n291\n00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.635\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that could suck up all\n\n292\n00:14:32.635 --> 00:14:33.145\nmy bandwidth.\n\n293\n00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:34.995\nI'm doing this during business hours,\nall of a sudden,\n\n294\n00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:36.905\nmy users can't connect to their resources,\n\n295\n00:14:36.905 --> 00:14:41.175\nbecause my replication is taking up all\nthe bandwidth, or it's gonna take forever.\n\n296\n00:14:41.175 --> 00:14:44.405\nOr if it's intermittent connectivity,\nthe replication fails, and\n\n297\n00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:46.645\nnow we've got other issues\nwe gotta deal with.\n\n298\n00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:49.490\nSo a situation like that\ncan cause a problem.\n\n299\n00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.785\n&gt;&gt; I wish there was a better way.\n\n300\n00:14:51.785 --> 00:14:53.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Your wish is my,\n\n301\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.490\nwhatever they say, I guess.\n\n302\n00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.220\nWe can make that wish come true, Cherokee.\n\n303\n00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n304\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.820\nnow let's take a look at this screen here,\nand\n\n305\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.630\nnow you'll understand\nwhat these options are.\n\n306\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.800\nSo the first one is\nsimply a drop down list.\n\n307\n00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.640\nSpecify additional replication option.\n\n308\n00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.190\nRather than letting it just pick and\n\n309\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.840\nchoose which domain controller it\nreplicates from, I can specify.\n\n310\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.580\nLet's say I'm setting up at\nthe branch office not the first, but\n\n311\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.980\nthe second domain controller, all right?\n\n312\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.350\nWell, when I set that second\ndomain controller up,\n\n313\n00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.620\nI understand it's gonna replicate\nthe entire Active Directory database.\n\n314\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.800\nThere is a domain controller right there\non the same LAN at the branch office.\n\n315\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.604\nAnd I would like you to\nreplicate from that.\n\n316\n00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:35.828\nBut if I don't specify, there's\na chance it reaches across the LAN and\n\n317\n00:15:35.828 --> 00:15:38.636\npicks a domain controller from\nover there to replicate from.\n\n318\n00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:41.660\nEven though there's a domain\ncontroller sitting right next to it.\n\n319\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.440\nSo what I can do is use this drop down\nlist and say, hey look, replicate from\n\n320\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.685\nthe direct domain controller\nthat's on the same subnet as you.\n\n321\n00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:52.816\nI can pick its name and say that's\nthe one I want you to replicate from,\n\n322\n00:15:52.816 --> 00:15:56.037\nright, so that's one option,\npick the- actually,\n\n323\n00:15:56.037 --> 00:15:59.136\nchoose which domain\ncontroller we replicate from.\n\n324\n00:15:59.136 --> 00:16:02.020\nThat can help,\nthat can limit the traffic to the LAN.\n\n325\n00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.430\nThe other option is install from media,\n\n326\n00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.860\nmaybe I'm setting up the first domain\ncontroller at the branch office.\n\n327\n00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.615\nAnd there is no other domain\ncontroller out there to pick,\n\n328\n00:16:12.615 --> 00:16:14.210\nto make it replicate from.\n\n329\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.290\nThe only replication is gonna have\nto occur across the WAN if that's\n\n330\n00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.320\nthe route I choose, cuz he's the first\ndomain controller at the branch office.\n\n331\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.590\nA way we can get around that is we can\n\n332\n00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.930\nbackup the Active Directory database,\nall right.\n\n333\n00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.270\nAnd then take a copy of that\nbackup out to that branch office.\n\n334\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.836\nAnd now make that copy local\nto that domain controller,\n\n335\n00:16:35.836 --> 00:16:37.650\nthe domain controller\nwe're trying to create.\n\n336\n00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.160\nAnd say hey, replicate from this backup,\n\n337\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.630\nrather than from an existing\ndomain controller.\n\n338\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.060\n&gt;&gt; So let's just say if, I don't know,\n\n339\n00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.810\nmaybe I had to drive an hour to\nget to that remote location.\n\n340\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.580\nAny changes that have been made within\nthat hour, like any delta changes,\n\n341\n00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.110\nthen those would be really the only\nthing I'd have to pull down,\n\n342\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.880\nany kind of difference there.\n\n343\n00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.880\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly right, which is gonna be a\nlot less than the entire database, right?\n\n344\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.390\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; How many things have changed in\n\n345\n00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:01.903\nthe last hour?\n\n346\n00:17:01.903 --> 00:17:06.112\nAny new users, new group policies,\npassword changes, what have you,\n\n347\n00:17:06.112 --> 00:17:09.228\nyes those would definitely\nstill have to replicate.\n\n348\n00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:11.195\nAnd it might be a day or two, right,\n\n349\n00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:14.030\nyou might put this back up\non a portable hard drive.\n\n350\n00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.625\nAnd then mail that, right, FedEx it out\nto the office in Timbuktu, they get it,\n\n351\n00:17:18.625 --> 00:17:19.854\nit's been two days.\n\n352\n00:17:19.854 --> 00:17:23.941\nSo there's definitely gonna be some\nreplication that has to occur, but\n\n353\n00:17:23.941 --> 00:17:28.631\nthe bulk of the replication is prevented\nbecause I've got that back up that I made,\n\n354\n00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:29.312\nall right.\n\n355\n00:17:29.312 --> 00:17:33.510\nThat's what this means install from media,\nand if I choose this check mark,\n\n356\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.220\nI'll see an new option.\n\n357\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.465\nHey, okay, I'll install from media,\njust tell me where it is.\n\n358\n00:17:39.645 --> 00:17:40.290\nWhere is it?\n\n359\n00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.595\nThat's a good question right?\n\n360\n00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:42.675\nThat-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n361\n00:17:42.675 --> 00:17:45.065\nthen that's when you're given\nthe tracking number right?\n\n362\n00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:48.665\nWell- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I tried typing in that tracking number\n\n363\n00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:51.395\nhere, and it did not work.\n\n364\n00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:52.835\nI don't know, crazy.\n\n365\n00:17:52.835 --> 00:17:55.535\nSo let's see how we can do this.\n\n366\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.710\nAll it is is a special backup of Active\nDirectory that's just for this purpose.\n\n367\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:06.080\nYou go to any existing domain control,\nread, write domain controller.\n\n368\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:12.320\nAnd you create the back up using what's\nknown as Ntdsutil, a command line utility\n\n369\n00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.000\nto create this special IFN install for\nmedia back up, and then you can take that.\n\n370\n00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.911\nSo, let's see how we create that back up,\nall right.\n\n371\n00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:25.222\nSo over here on DCO1 who is my full\nblown read, write domain controller,\n\n372\n00:18:25.222 --> 00:18:28.430\nI'm gonna launch\nan administrative command prompt.\n\n373\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.010\nAll right, and\nit's an Ntdsutil command, so\n\n374\n00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.694\nthe first thing we do is ntdsutil, and\n\n375\n00:18:39.694 --> 00:18:44.210\nnotice I'm not at an ntdsutil prompt,\nokay.\n\n376\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.179\nOnce we get inside ntdsutil,\n\n377\n00:18:46.179 --> 00:18:51.549\nwe have to tell it what it is we're gonna\nbe working with, what instance of ntds.\n\n378\n00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:55.053\nCuz I don't know if you guys have learned\nabout this yet in this particular course,\n\n379\n00:18:55.053 --> 00:18:56.805\nbut not only do we have Active Directory,\n\n380\n00:18:56.805 --> 00:19:00.430\nwe also have Active Directory\nLightweight Directory Services, or LDS.\n\n381\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.895\nI could be making a backup of that, so\nI have to point it to my Active Directory.\n\n382\n00:19:03.895 --> 00:19:08.210\nActivate, instance, ntds,\n\n383\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.002\nall right, and it says Active,\ninstance set to ntds.\n\n384\n00:19:13.002 --> 00:19:16.330\nSo now it's pointed to my\nActive Directory installation,\n\n385\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.644\nnot some other light weight\ndirectory installation, all right.\n\n386\n00:19:19.644 --> 00:19:23.824\nThen we type in ifm,\ninstall from media, and\n\n387\n00:19:23.824 --> 00:19:28.013\nnotice now I'm at an ifm prompt,\nall right.\n\n388\n00:19:28.013 --> 00:19:32.100\nI don't know if I can get help from\nwithin here, let's see, yeah, we can.\n\n389\n00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n390\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.240\n&gt;&gt; I typed help to show you,\n\n391\n00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.088\nreally there's four options I\ncan do with ifm, all right.\n\n392\n00:19:39.088 --> 00:19:46.360\nThere's create full, which, it depends\non what you're trying to install.\n\n393\n00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.350\nIf the domain controller I'm trying to\ncreate is going to be a read, write domain\n\n394\n00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:56.300\ncontroller, then when I make the back up,\nI'm gonna use the key word full.\n\n395\n00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.589\nBecause that's gonna copy the entire\nActive Directory database, and\n\n396\n00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:00.974\nmake it a part of that back up.\n\n397\n00:20:00.974 --> 00:20:05.683\nIf the domain controller I'm setting\nup out there, is going to be\n\n398\n00:20:05.683 --> 00:20:10.662\nread only domain controller,\nthen I do create RODC instead of full.\n\n399\n00:20:10.662 --> 00:20:14.160\nBecause RODCs don't include\nthe entire Active Directory database.\n\n400\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.410\nAgain, that's for another episode, but\nthey don't include all the secrets, none\n\n401\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.630\nof the passwords are there by default,\nwe have to specify which ones we want.\n\n402\n00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.030\nSo if you're setting up a read only,\ncreate RODC.\n\n403\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.820\n&gt;&gt; If you're setting up a read,\nwrite, create full, right.\n\n404\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.380\nThen we can also choose to include or\nnot include SYSVOL, remember\n\n405\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.160\nthat's that folder structure that gets\ncreated when we install Active Directory.\n\n406\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.980\nIt can change the group policies and\n\n407\n00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.720\nsome other things that\nActive Directory uses for replication.\n\n408\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.340\nWe can include that in the backup\nof the Active Directory database.\n\n409\n00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.020\nAnd then when we set up\nour new domain controller,\n\n410\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.550\nit's one less thing it has to\nreplicate across the network.\n\n411\n00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:57.000\nI will tell you that I typically\ndon't include SYSVOLl,\n\n412\n00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.270\nit's usually one not that big,\nnot that much replication.\n\n413\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.980\nAnd if you are gonna include SYSVOL,\nwhen we move this special backup,\n\n414\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.710\nI have to use a special\ntool called Robocopy.\n\n415\n00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.687\nBecause the access control lists on\nthe SYSVOL folder have to be maintained\n\n416\n00:21:13.687 --> 00:21:14.877\nduring the move.\n\n417\n00:21:14.877 --> 00:21:18.651\nSo that all domain controllers have\nread access to that SYSVOL folder, read,\n\n418\n00:21:18.651 --> 00:21:20.850\nwrite access to that SYSVOL.\n\n419\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:27.870\nSo keep that in mind if you're gonna\nuse ifm, and you wanna include SYSVOL.\n\n420\n00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.650\nYou're gonna have to use\nRobocopy to move that back up\n\n421\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.720\nto maintain the access control\nlists on that SYSVOL folder.\n\n422\n00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.380\nI find it much easier not to worry\nabout that, leave SYSVOL out, and\n\n423\n00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.820\njust let it replicate after I've\nset up the domain controller.\n\n424\n00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.360\nCuz I've really saved\nthe bulk of the replication\n\n425\n00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.140\nby copying over\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n426\n00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.030\nAll right, so for us,\nCherokee,we are going to do full.\n\n427\n00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:59.533\nSo it's gonna be create,\nif I can spell here,\n\n428\n00:21:59.533 --> 00:22:04.189\nA-T-E, there we go create full, and\n\n429\n00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:09.846\nthen the path, right, c;\\ifm for example.\n\n430\n00:22:09.846 --> 00:22:15.835\nIf I was gonna do this for\na read only, again it would be rodc,\n\n431\n00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:22.781\nright, if I wanted to include SYSVOL,\nI put sysvol out in front of it.\n\n432\n00:22:22.781 --> 00:22:27.390\nIf I was doing full, it would be,\noops, full like that.\n\n433\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.200\nI am gonna leave off SYSVOL because\nI don't want it, and so that's it.\n\n434\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.570\nWe'll hit Enter, and\nit says Creating snapshot.\n\n435\n00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.330\nAnd one of the coolest things ever in the\ncommand prompt is about to appear right\n\n436\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.485\nin front of your very eyes.\n\n437\n00:22:38.485 --> 00:22:40.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Give it a second.\n\n438\n00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.630\nLook at that.\n\n439\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:41.212\n&gt;&gt; Progress bar.\n\n440\n00:22:41.212 --> 00:22:42.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I do love\n\n441\n00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.335\nit when they make progress bars\non a command prompt interface.\n\n442\n00:22:46.335 --> 00:22:46.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n443\n00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.000\nit defragments the Active Directory\ndatabase to make sure it's nice and tidy.\n\n444\n00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.560\nAnd then it creates the backup\nof the registry keys and\n\n445\n00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.780\nthe Active Directory database, and\nthen unmounts it for me, and that was it.\n\n446\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.865\nNow, my database has-\n&gt;&gt; Very little.\n\n447\n00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:04.012\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Two users, I think,\n\n448\n00:23:04.012 --> 00:23:08.380\nand that's it, right, so it didn't take\nvery long at all, it's teeny teeny tiny.\n\n449\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.050\n&gt;&gt; Depending on that size, yes.\n\n450\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.480\n&gt;&gt; If you were in an environment where\nActive Directory's been around since\n\n451\n00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.370\nthe beginning of your business in 2004,\n\n452\n00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.820\nit's gonna be quite\na bit of data in there.\n\n453\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.346\nI didn't mean Active Directory came out in\n2004, I'm saying if you had a decade of\n\n454\n00:23:25.346 --> 00:23:29.500\ndata in your Active Directory database,\nit would be rather large, all right.\n\n455\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.430\nSo we are done with ifm,\nthat was all we get.\n\n456\n00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.889\nSo I'll type quite to get out of ifm,\nQuit again to get out of ntds,\n\n457\n00:23:36.889 --> 00:23:38.732\nand then we'll just exit.\n\n458\n00:23:38.732 --> 00:23:42.523\nOr I tell you what we could do,\nwe could do cdc: dir, and\n\n459\n00:23:42.523 --> 00:23:45.850\nyou'll see there's\na folder there called ifm.\n\n460\n00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:53.011\nAnd if I look inside ifm, we'll see there\nis my backup of Active Directory and\n\n461\n00:23:53.011 --> 00:23:56.980\nthe registry and\nthey're all in those directories, and\n\n462\n00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.724\nif went into the Active Directory one.\n\n463\n00:23:59.724 --> 00:24:03.246\nWe would actually see ntds.dit.\n\n464\n00:24:03.246 --> 00:24:07.415\nThere's my Active Directory database,\nall 35 megs of it.\n\n465\n00:24:07.415 --> 00:24:08.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is a whopper.\n\n466\n00:24:08.892 --> 00:24:11.873\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwe can exit out the command prompt.\n\n467\n00:24:11.873 --> 00:24:16.838\nAnd then what I would do, and\nwe're not gonna do it here because,\n\n468\n00:24:16.838 --> 00:24:21.672\nwell, I guess we could,\nlet's see if I can copy that over.\n\n469\n00:24:21.672 --> 00:24:22.906\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I'll copy,\n\n470\n00:24:22.906 --> 00:24:27.438\nwhat you do is you take that entire\nfolder, and you put it on external media.\n\n471\n00:24:27.438 --> 00:24:29.549\nIn my case, I've got Virtual Machine, so\n\n472\n00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:32.208\nI'm gonna use a folder that\nthey both have access to.\n\n473\n00:24:32.208 --> 00:24:36.504\nOops, that is not what I wanted to do,\nall right, so there's my IFM.\n\n474\n00:24:36.504 --> 00:24:41.253\nSo pretend this is my thumb drive, or\nmy USB drive that I just put it on, right?\n\n475\n00:24:41.253 --> 00:24:45.462\nThen you go out to the branch office,\nor you call the admin out there, and\n\n476\n00:24:45.462 --> 00:24:49.207\ntell her or him that, hey,\nyour thumb drive should be the mail.\n\n477\n00:24:49.207 --> 00:24:51.232\nAnd when you get it, do, da, da, da, da.\n\n478\n00:24:51.232 --> 00:24:54.874\nOnce they get it, they're gonna go through\nthe promotion wizard, just like this,\n\n479\n00:24:54.874 --> 00:24:57.151\nchoose Install from media,\nwhich, you know what?\n\n480\n00:24:57.151 --> 00:24:59.313\nI didn't copy it over, [LAUGH].\n\n481\n00:24:59.313 --> 00:25:02.089\nLet's go grab that,\nI like to have it local,\n\n482\n00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:06.636\nI don't like to work with it on\nthe removable media, but that's just me.\n\n483\n00:25:06.636 --> 00:25:09.365\nI'm gonna put it back on the C drive here.\n\n484\n00:25:11.592 --> 00:25:14.070\nAll right, so basically,\nI just copied over.\n\n485\n00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.130\n&gt;&gt; Off the flash drive.\n\n486\n00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.924\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, off my removable media, yes.\n\n487\n00:25:17.924 --> 00:25:19.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nthen put it on your C drive.\n\n488\n00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:20.359\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n489\n00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:24.823\nSo now I run through this wizard and\nI choose the additional option,\n\n490\n00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:27.810\ninstall from media,\nI hit my browse button.\n\n491\n00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.692\nAnd I go find that IFM folder, and\nI don't need to dig down into it,\n\n492\n00:25:33.692 --> 00:25:37.383\nI just grab the root IFM folder and\ntell it where it is.\n\n493\n00:25:37.383 --> 00:25:41.810\nIt'll figure out the rest when I click,\nit's actually already verifying it,\n\n494\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.540\nbut I'm gonna click Verify anyway.\n\n495\n00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.276\nJust because I like to do that and\nthere we can see,\n\n496\n00:25:47.276 --> 00:25:50.811\nit's checking to see if it's readable,\nif it's not corrupt.\n\n497\n00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:53.010\nPermissions are okay, you can access it.\n\n498\n00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.759\nIt doesn't know what\nusers should be there,\n\n499\n00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:56.239\nwhat group policies should be there.\n\n500\n00:25:56.239 --> 00:25:59.980\nSo don't think it's checking that you\ngot a good backup or a current backup.\n\n501\n00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.421\nIt's just saying, yep, that'll work,\nI can import from that, all right?\n\n502\n00:26:04.421 --> 00:26:08.645\nAnd there's nothing to say you can't\ndo both of these options, right?\n\n503\n00:26:08.645 --> 00:26:11.248\nMaybe I want to install\nfrom media like this and\n\n504\n00:26:11.248 --> 00:26:15.700\nchoose that other domain controller\nthat's there, the branch office.\n\n505\n00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.972\nFor the result replication, right?\n\n506\n00:26:17.972 --> 00:26:20.690\nThe changes that have occurred since IFM.\n\n507\n00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.699\nSo nothing says you can't use\nboth of these options together.\n\n508\n00:26:24.699 --> 00:26:29.470\nAt that point, we click Next, and\nwe're right back to our normal wizard.\n\n509\n00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.784\nWe'll let this run, I'll click,\nit's gonna go through the prereqs,\n\n510\n00:26:32.784 --> 00:26:34.316\nmake sure everything's there.\n\n511\n00:26:34.316 --> 00:26:37.720\nAnd then I'll click Install,\nand we'll have a second\n\n512\n00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.314\ndomain controller using those advanced\noptions, known as good old IFM.\n\n513\n00:26:42.314 --> 00:26:45.794\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, so now I have a work\naround against any kind of high latency\n\n514\n00:26:45.794 --> 00:26:47.254\nissues for my network there.\n\n515\n00:26:47.254 --> 00:26:48.011\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n516\n00:26:48.011 --> 00:26:49.065\n&gt;&gt; But we've got a couple of other things.\n\n517\n00:26:49.065 --> 00:26:49.894\n&gt;&gt; We do, don't we?\n\n518\n00:26:49.894 --> 00:26:53.168\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking at the clock here, Mike,\nand I think we have time to go ahead and\n\n519\n00:26:53.168 --> 00:26:55.384\nat least maybe talk about them,\nwhat do you think?\n\n520\n00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:58.118\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully, I tell you what,\nlet's do, yeah, let's do that,\n\n521\n00:26:58.118 --> 00:27:01.282\ncuz then we can install, I'm gonna go\nahead and click and Install on this.\n\n522\n00:27:01.282 --> 00:27:02.266\nAnd you want to do a race?\n\n523\n00:27:02.266 --> 00:27:04.186\nLet me just see how much I can get\ndone in the next five minutes.\n\n524\n00:27:04.186 --> 00:27:05.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No,\n\n525\n00:27:05.173 --> 00:27:06.459\nI wouldn't do that to you guys out there.\n\n526\n00:27:06.459 --> 00:27:10.987\nAll right, so we still want to take\na look at Core, so let's jump over and\n\n527\n00:27:10.987 --> 00:27:12.267\ndo that real quick.\n\n528\n00:27:12.267 --> 00:27:16.495\nWe also wanna look at what, FSMOs, DNS,\nglobal catalog, we do have a lot to do,\n\n529\n00:27:16.495 --> 00:27:17.132\ndon't we?\n\n530\n00:27:17.132 --> 00:27:18.953\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll do it in part,\nwhat are we at?\n\n531\n00:27:18.953 --> 00:27:20.385\nWe're at part three, so okay.\n\n532\n00:27:20.385 --> 00:27:21.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you know what I'm thinking?\n\n533\n00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We should just wait until, we'll let\n\n534\n00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:29.250\nthis finish and call this an episode,\nwhen we come back, then we can do Core.\n\n535\n00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.886\n&gt;&gt; Server Core, and\nthen we'll talk about global catalogs, and\n\n536\n00:27:32.886 --> 00:27:35.551\nall those other things that-\n&gt;&gt; DNS records, and\n\n537\n00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:37.443\nyou know what I'm gonna do though?\n\n538\n00:27:37.443 --> 00:27:38.837\nWhile we've got a couple minutes left,\n\n539\n00:27:38.837 --> 00:27:41.515\nI want to show you those flexible single\nmaster operations roles real quick.\n\n540\n00:27:41.515 --> 00:27:42.104\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n541\n00:27:42.104 --> 00:27:42.814\n&gt;&gt; Is that okay?\n\n542\n00:27:42.814 --> 00:27:45.646\nWe can try to finish up with that,\nand maybe this wizard will finish.\n\n543\n00:27:45.646 --> 00:27:50.253\nRemember I said that 2012 R2 takes\ncare of Adprep, forest prep,\n\n544\n00:27:50.253 --> 00:27:53.236\ndomain prep, GP prep,\ndoes all that for us.\n\n545\n00:27:53.236 --> 00:27:54.294\n&gt;&gt; The RODC?\n\n546\n00:27:54.294 --> 00:27:55.760\n&gt;&gt; Not the RODC, because it doesn't\nknow if you want one or not.\n\n547\n00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.426\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n548\n00:27:56.426 --> 00:27:59.978\n&gt;&gt; So, you'd have to run that one\nmanually, but the other three.\n\n549\n00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:00.555\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n550\n00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:02.944\n&gt;&gt; It'll do automatically for\nyou, but as I said,\n\n551\n00:28:02.944 --> 00:28:04.819\nit's a good idea to understand them.\n\n552\n00:28:04.819 --> 00:28:06.965\nBecause you might have to troubleshoot, or\n\n553\n00:28:06.965 --> 00:28:11.060\nthere might be an issue with your account\nnot having the right credentials.\n\n554\n00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.581\nRemember, to run forest prep, you've got\nto be an enterprise admin, schema admin,\n\n555\n00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:15.367\nand domain admin.\n\n556\n00:28:15.367 --> 00:28:19.342\nSo if you've been tasked with\nsetting up this new domain in your\n\n557\n00:28:19.342 --> 00:28:24.078\nfirst 2012 domain controller,\nyou might not have rights to run this.\n\n558\n00:28:24.078 --> 00:28:28.634\nIn which case it would fail and now\nyou've got to troubleshoot that, right?\n\n559\n00:28:28.634 --> 00:28:33.442\nSo let's take a look, there's actually\na couple of different places you can go\n\n560\n00:28:33.442 --> 00:28:36.910\nto figure out where\nthese role holders are.\n\n561\n00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:40.401\nMy favorite is just a netdom command,\nit's the old way to do it, but\n\n562\n00:28:40.401 --> 00:28:42.375\nto me, it's the most efficient way.\n\n563\n00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:48.770\nNetdom query fsmo,\nflexible single master operations.\n\n564\n00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.833\nAnd what this is going to do is list\nout those five roles that only exist on\n\n565\n00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:54.268\none domain controller.\n\n566\n00:28:54.268 --> 00:28:58.237\nTwo of them, these first two, one\ndomain controller in the entire forest,\n\n567\n00:28:58.237 --> 00:28:59.920\nthe last three are domain wise.\n\n568\n00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.093\nOne domain controller per domain\nholds those roles, again,\n\n569\n00:29:03.093 --> 00:29:06.523\nI don't want to go into that,\nI know we do this in another episode.\n\n570\n00:29:06.523 --> 00:29:09.451\nBut what I wanted to show you was how\nto figure out which was one was holding\n\n571\n00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:10.390\nwhich role.\n\n572\n00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.270\nBecause when you run those\nAdprep commands, remember,\n\n573\n00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.319\nI said you've got to be able to contact.\n\n574\n00:29:15.319 --> 00:29:19.702\nIf the schema master is unavailable, and\nyou try to run Adprep forest prep, well,\n\n575\n00:29:19.702 --> 00:29:22.590\nthe schema master's\nthe only writable copy.\n\n576\n00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.343\nSo that command is going to fail.\n\n577\n00:29:24.343 --> 00:29:27.469\nSo it's important to understand what\nmachines are holding what roles, so\n\n578\n00:29:27.469 --> 00:29:29.270\nI can make sure they're online.\n\n579\n00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:33.119\nIf the infrastructure master is down,\nit's not going to be able to complete that\n\n580\n00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:35.340\nphase of the Active Directory\ninstallation.\n\n581\n00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.699\nIt can't verify names, things like that,\nit can't figure out who the existing\n\n582\n00:29:39.699 --> 00:29:42.960\ndomain controllers are,\nthat part is going to fail.\n\n583\n00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.561\nSo if the, in this case,\nall five roles are on one machine,\n\n584\n00:29:46.561 --> 00:29:49.167\nbecause I've got one domain controller.\n\n585\n00:29:49.167 --> 00:29:50.740\n&gt;&gt; Just installed it, yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n586\n00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it's not too exciting,\nbut in your world,\n\n587\n00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.992\nthings might have moved over time,\nthey might have moved these roles.\n\n588\n00:29:56.992 --> 00:30:00.080\n&gt;&gt; Break them apart to create\nthat extra redundancy there,\n\n589\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.017\njust to not have all of our eggs sitting\nthere in that proverbial basket.\n\n590\n00:30:04.017 --> 00:30:06.989\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, yeah,\none might be performing more than another.\n\n591\n00:30:06.989 --> 00:30:10.240\nLike the PDC emulator,\nthat's a very important domain wide role.\n\n592\n00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.716\nSo I might move that to one of my beefier\ndomain controllers that has the extra\n\n593\n00:30:13.716 --> 00:30:15.687\nresources to do normal Active Directory.\n\n594\n00:30:15.687 --> 00:30:19.565\nAnd then this extra job we're throwing\non top of it, so, they might move.\n\n595\n00:30:19.565 --> 00:30:21.847\nSo it's important to understand\nhow we can find them so\n\n596\n00:30:21.847 --> 00:30:23.644\nthat we can make sure\nthat they are online.\n\n597\n00:30:23.644 --> 00:30:26.675\nI think when I did one of the episodes,\nwhere we were talking about this,\n\n598\n00:30:26.675 --> 00:30:29.555\nI might have said you have to\ngo to the machine and run it.\n\n599\n00:30:29.555 --> 00:30:31.800\nLet me make sure I explain that.\n\n600\n00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.065\nYou don't actually have to go to\nthe schema master and run the command.\n\n601\n00:30:36.065 --> 00:30:39.468\nIt needs to be on, running, and\nreachable across the network.\n\n602\n00:30:39.468 --> 00:30:43.400\nAs long as they can find it, reach out and\ntalk to it, it should be good to go.\n\n603\n00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.919\nSo you don't have to actually\nlog into the schema master, but\n\n604\n00:30:46.919 --> 00:30:48.417\nit does have to be online.\n\n605\n00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:52.440\nAnd there's, like I said, there's other\nways, we'll round out this episode,\n\n606\n00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.820\nthat one shows me all\nfive in one location.\n\n607\n00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.866\nThat's fantastic.\n\n608\n00:30:55.866 --> 00:30:59.958\nIf you wanted to find them individually,\nyou'd have to go to\n\n609\n00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:04.870\nActive Directory users and computers\nto get your the domain wide roles.\n\n610\n00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.927\nThe infrastructure master,\nPCC emulator and the read master.\n\n611\n00:31:08.927 --> 00:31:11.534\nIf you want to find out who\nyour domain naming master is,\n\n612\n00:31:11.534 --> 00:31:15.150\nActive Directory sites and\nservices console will do that for you.\n\n613\n00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.742\nIf you want to find your\nActive Directory schema master,\n\n614\n00:31:17.742 --> 00:31:20.880\nyou actually have to create a custom\nconsole with the schema snap in.\n\n615\n00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.604\nYou have to register the snap in,\ncreate the console, and\n\n616\n00:31:23.604 --> 00:31:25.470\nthen you can figure it out.\n\n617\n00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.422\nSo that's why I like net.query,\nbecause it's all five in one place, and\n\n618\n00:31:29.422 --> 00:31:31.318\nI don't have to do anything extra.\n\n619\n00:31:31.318 --> 00:31:34.721\nBut that is how you find them,\nand then we'll save the rest for\n\n620\n00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:36.455\nour part umpteen or whatever.\n\n621\n00:31:36.455 --> 00:31:38.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And yeah,\nwe don't need to rehash all that,\n\n622\n00:31:38.716 --> 00:31:41.828\nwe just told you what we are going to\nbe looking at in that next episode.\n\n623\n00:31:41.828 --> 00:31:43.760\nSo thank you, Mike, for joining us today.\n\n624\n00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.196\nAnd thank you for being with us as well,\nbut we will go ahead and sign out for\n\n625\n00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:47.762\nthis show.\n\n626\n00:31:47.762 --> 00:31:48.852\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n627\n00:31:48.852 --> 00:31:49.852\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n628\n00:31:49.852 --> 00:31:51.857\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n629\n00:31:53.442 -->

you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia,\n\n4\n00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:12.070\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.773\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your 70-410 series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:19.103\nI say welcome back because if you haven't\nnoticed, this is actually a part four,\n\n7\n00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:23.434\na continuation, of a topic that we were\ndiscussing different ways so that we could\n\n8\n00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:27.530\ngo ahead and install and set up our\nActive Directory domain controllers.\n\n9\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.200\nAnd back with us today in studios\nwe have Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.340\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.590\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.880\nThanks for having me back and thanks for\nputting up with all of my parts.\n\n13\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.680\nIt's a lot of stuff to installing\nin Active Directory, all right?\n\n14\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.920\n&gt;&gt; There is a lot to think about.\n\n15\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.120\nAnd we're just kind of getting\nstarted here on our journey.\n\n16\n00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.830\nSo hopefully you'll be able to hang out\nhere with us and go through all of that.\n\n17\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.630\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to it cuz Active\nDirectory is one of my favorite topics.\n\n18\n00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.570\nDirectory D and SNL,\nall the infrastructure, the core services,\n\n19\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.450\nthat's where it's at.\n\n20\n00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.000\nIn our previous episodes, we talked about\nActive Directory, understand what it is,\n\n21\n00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.850\nwe looked at setting up a A brand\nnew domain and a brand new forest.\n\n22\n00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.510\nWe also looked at adding a domain,\n\n23\n00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.133\nadding a new domain controller\nto an existing domain.\n\n24\n00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:17.460\nI showed you the option for creating a\nchild or a new tree in an existing forest.\n\n25\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.258\nWe also got to look at\nthe install from media option.\n\n26\n00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:25.429\nTook a look at that, it helps save us some\nbandwidth on that replication as well\n\n27\n00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.793\nas choosing what domain controller\nwe're replicating from.\n\n28\n00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:31.300\nSo we got some good options done there.\n\n29\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.656\nThe next one I wanna do is Server Core.\n\n30\n00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:38.230\nAll right, and this is something\nthat you're gonna see more and\n\n31\n00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.700\nmore of if you're not used\nto working with Server Core,\n\n32\n00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.630\nyou should definitely start,\nMicrosoft is definitely pushing core.\n\n33\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.197\nIf you're unfamiliar with what it is just,\nI know we've talked about this in past\n\n34\n00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:52.724\nepisodes so\nyou guys are familiar with Core.\n\n35\n00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:55.050\nAnd all the reasons we should use it.\n\n36\n00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.220\nSo let's just take a look.\n\n37\n00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.000\nHow do I work with it.\n\n38\n00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.840\nHow do I get active directory installed\non a core when there is no wizard?\n\n39\n00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.226\nThere is no little clicky add roles and\nfeatures.\n\n40\n00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.630\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n41\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.950\nNow one way I could do it, is if\nthe server was a member of my domain,\n\n42\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.150\nwhich it's going to be,\nI could actually manage it remotely.\n\n43\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.340\nIf I had already set all that up,\nwe could add it here, and\n\n44\n00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.480\nI could right click in here,\nand add roles and features.\n\n45\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.950\nSo let's do it remotely.\n\n46\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.670\nAnd honestly this is probably the way\nmost people are going to work with it\n\n47\n00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.640\nbecause it's what it's designed for.\n\n48\n00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.320\nWe don't manage it locally.\n\n49\n00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.000\nWe don't remote desktop into it\nbecause there is no desktop.\n\n50\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.284\nWe just manage it remotely.\n\n51\n00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:38.463\n&gt;&gt; Right, why would I wanna\ntax that particular server and\n\n52\n00:02:38.463 --> 00:02:43.130\nutilize that processing in the CPU power\nwhen I can go ahead and manage remotely?\n\n53\n00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sitting on my Windows 10 box\nand I'm managing everything from there,\n\n54\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.450\nor Windows 8.1 I guess at the-\n&gt;&gt; Server 2012?\n\n55\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that server 2012, yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:54.078\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Into the future you can see.\n\n57\n00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:57.990\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nlet me flip over to my core.\n\n58\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.270\nSo we're not gonna do it that way.\n\n59\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.510\nThat way would be too easy.\n\n60\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.340\n&gt;&gt; Of course it would.\n\n61\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.270\n&gt;&gt; We're going to, yeah,\nwe're gonna make Mike really struggle, and\n\n62\n00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.830\nwork on Core itself.\n\n63\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.880\nSo I've already got Core installed.\n\n64\n00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.885\nAnd I forgot,\n\n65\n00:03:11.885 --> 00:03:16.730\nit's joined to the domain, which is\none of the first things you can do.\n\n66\n00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.290\nI use S Config.\n\n67\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.710\nIt's my favorite thing to do.\n\n68\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.195\n&gt;&gt; That's what Mike does on the weekends.\n\n69\n00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:24.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's my hobby.\n\n70\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.970\nS Config, if you're not familiar with it,\nand it might be going away eventually.\n\n71\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.887\nSo I wouldn't get too dependent on it,\nlearn your Power Shell commands but\n\n72\n00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:38.645\nit's like a menu, a little number\ndriven menu system that allows me to do\n\n73\n00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:42.960\nsome configuration,\nsome basic configuration on Server Core.\n\n74\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.700\nBecause there are some\nthings I'm gonna need to do.\n\n75\n00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.440\nIf I'm gonna add this as an additional\ndomain controller to an existing domain,\n\n76\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.380\nit needs to be part of the domain,\nso I've joined it to the domain,\n\n77\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.690\nusing S config, here.\n\n78\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.500\nI also need to go ahead and name it,\nright, give it the appropriate name.\n\n79\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.184\nI could rename that DCO3 or\nsomething like that.\n\n80\n00:04:00.184 --> 00:04:02.510\nBut it needs to be part of the domain.\n\n81\n00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.670\nI should turn on updates.\n\n82\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.980\nMy guys don't have internet access.\n\n83\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.340\nI don't want them updating in the middle\nof a show, so I've left that turned off.\n\n84\n00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.100\nBut network settings and date and time,\n\n85\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.958\nthese are two that I\nreally need to configure.\n\n86\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:14.540\n&gt;&gt; Important, yes.\n\n87\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, before I go and\njoin this guy to the domain.\n\n88\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.930\nSo, what I would do is that you'd hit\nnumber 8, to get in network settings.\n\n89\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.260\nAnd it shows you a list of all your IP-\nyour network adapters in your machine,\n\n90\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.674\ntell it which one you wanna work with.\n\n91\n00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:33.530\nMine is index 10 all right,\nso I type 10 and I hit enter.\n\n92\n00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.160\nAnd it shows me my current information,\nall of which I've already set.\n\n93\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.110\nBut if I didn't, I could say,\nset network adapter address.\n\n94\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.610\nNumber one.\n\n95\n00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:44.730\nDo I want a static DHCP?\n\n96\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.580\nI want static.\n\n97\n00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.809\nRight, what is your address?\n\n98\n00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:51.700\nLet's do 10.10.8.199.\n\n99\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.983\nWhat's your subnet mask,\n255, 255, 255, 0 and\n\n100\n00:04:56.983 --> 00:05:02.682\nmy default gateway 10, 10,\n8.2 if I remember correctly.\n\n101\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.390\nAnd there we go, all right?\n\n102\n00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.780\nWhat you really wanna pay attention\nto here, and an easy gotcha is,\n\n103\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.880\nunlike in the GUI,\nwhen you're setting your TCP/IP settings,\n\n104\n00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.765\nyou've got IP subnet,\ndefault gateway, right?\n\n105\n00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.545\nBelow that preferred an alternate DNS.\n\n106\n00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:21.085\nAnd here,\nit asked me about those first three.\n\n107\n00:05:21.085 --> 00:05:22.585\nBut not DNS, and\nit's an easy one to forget.\n\n108\n00:05:22.585 --> 00:05:26.245\n&gt;&gt; So you have to make sure you take\nthe extra effort to go ahead and set that.\n\n109\n00:05:26.245 --> 00:05:31.055\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, because that will prevent you-\nif my machine can't contact an existing\n\n110\n00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:33.625\ndomain controller,\nI will not be able to join the domain.\n\n111\n00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.035\nI would not be able to make\na new domain controller.\n\n112\n00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.683\nNow I've already joined\nthe domain which means I probably\n\n113\n00:05:38.683 --> 00:05:40.475\nalready have access to the DNS server.\n\n114\n00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:42.785\nBut just understand,\nthat DNS has to be correct,\n\n115\n00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:45.510\nyou have to be able to find\nthat domain controller.\n\n116\n00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.830\nSo my DNS is already set to\nmy other domain controller,\n\n117\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.650\nif it wasn't, there's another option.\n\n118\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.090\nNumber two, set DNS server.\n\n119\n00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.000\nEnter your new preferred.\n\n120\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.220\nTen ten eight dot two hundred.\n\n121\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.220\nAnd it says it was set.\n\n122\n00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.520\nEnter your alternate, I don't have\nan alternate so I'll just blank for none.\n\n123\n00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.090\nAnd now all of my TCP IP settings are set.\n\n124\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.870\nFour, back out to the main menu.\n\n125\n00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.140\nDate and time again, is also important.\n\n126\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.170\nYou wanna make sure you're\non the right timezone.\n\n127\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.860\nAnd when things happen and\n\n128\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.970\nI have got to start correlating log\nfiles between different machines.\n\n129\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.870\nThis can be kind of important.\n\n130\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.160\nSo make sure that you have\nthe appropriate date and time set.\n\n131\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.045\nNot to say you can't change\nthat after the fact.\n\n132\n00:06:31.045 --> 00:06:34.562\nIt's just you know- might as well get\neverything while you are in here.\n\n133\n00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:36.920\nAll right,\nthen 15 to get back out of S config and\n\n134\n00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.800\nback to my normal command prompt.\n\n135\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.030\nAll right, so we've got all of our\nbasics set, it's part of the domain,\n\n136\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.760\nour TCP/IP settings are correct,\nI've named it.\n\n137\n00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.950\nNow, it's time to actually make\nthis guy a domain controller.\n\n138\n00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.434\nFor that, we're gonna use PowerShell,\nall right?\n\n139\n00:06:53.434 --> 00:06:55.740\nAnd so I just typed powershell, all right?\n\n140\n00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.010\nFrom Server Core, all I have is this\nCMD interface, type PowerShell,\n\n141\n00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.930\nnotice my prompt changes and\nI have a PS out in front of it and\n\n142\n00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.358\nI can use my PowerShell commands.\n\n143\n00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:09.250\nSo even though the background's not blue\nlike we're used to, this is PowerShell.\n\n144\n00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.973\nI can do get-windowsf.\n\n145\n00:07:14.973 --> 00:07:17.760\nMaybe, once it takes it's time here.\n\n146\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.412\nFirst time you tab out of fields,\nit's gonna kinda build everything up.\n\n147\n00:07:22.412 --> 00:07:25.720\nBut there you go,\nit's running through get Windows feature.\n\n148\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.263\nI picked the longest running\ncommand to show you-\n\n149\n00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:28.865\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.677\n&gt;&gt; That it was actually PowerShell.\n\n151\n00:07:30.677 --> 00:07:34.408\nNext time, git dash that IP address,\nand that will work even better.\n\n152\n00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:37.455\n&gt;&gt; And you know what we didn't\nreally mention in the last show,\n\n153\n00:07:37.455 --> 00:07:41.280\nwhen we showed this particular cmdlet\nhere, was the indentations there for\n\n154\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.167\nthe differentiation between the role and\nthe features.\n\n155\n00:07:44.167 --> 00:07:45.406\nSo you see, you can actually\nsee that in this output here.\n\n156\n00:07:45.406 --> 00:07:47.142\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you were telling me about that.\n\n157\n00:07:47.142 --> 00:07:50.230\nYeah, that is very true.\n\n158\n00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.056\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like,\nthe indented sections there.\n\n159\n00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:57.495\nThose are gonna be your features and the\nones that are further out to the left of\n\n160\n00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:59.965\nthe margin are gonna be your actual goals.\n\n161\n00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:00.813\n&gt;&gt; Got you, got you.\n\n162\n00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.084\nSee, you learn something new everyday.\n\n163\n00:08:02.084 --> 00:08:04.259\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n164\n00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:08.660\nwe can see that Active Directory\nDomain Services is not installed.\n\n165\n00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.630\nThat is what we're going to install.\n\n166\n00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.840\nSo let me clear up that screen,\nInstall-windowsFeature.\n\n167\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.612\nSo just like we used Get to retrieve them,\n\n168\n00:08:18.612 --> 00:08:23.485\nInstall is what we're gonna use\nto install one of those features.\n\n169\n00:08:23.485 --> 00:08:28.000\nInstall-windowsFeature, and\nthen the name of the feature.\n\n170\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.950\nYou could do a -name or\nyou could leave that out.\n\n171\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:36.205\nIt's kind of optional, I should do a -name\nbecause we are doing this as a demo.\n\n172\n00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:45.980\nad-domain-services And\nit's no longer case-sensitive.\n\n173\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.990\nAt least I'm pretty sure it's not.\n\n174\n00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.980\nWe're gonna find out as\nI type this command.\n\n175\n00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.820\nIt used to be case-sensitive.\n\n176\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.810\nAnd then this is an important one,\n-IncludeManagementTools, all right?\n\n177\n00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:02.208\nI wanna make sure I include those,\nI get my consoles, right.\n\n178\n00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.700\nWell, this is a GUI list, so\nI guess it that doesn't really matter.\n\n179\n00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.260\nBut my modules for\nPowerShell, things like that.\n\n180\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.140\nSo we're gonna include that,\nwe'll hit Enter.\n\n181\n00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.260\nAnd just like when we did it in the GUI,\nthis is like the first wizard, right.\n\n182\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.145\nThis is unpacking the role and\ngetting all the components ready, but\n\n183\n00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:23.110\nit's still not gonna be a domain\ncontroller when we're finished.\n\n184\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.740\nIt's just gonna have all the gears and\nlevers and\n\n185\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.270\nall the pieces ready to\nmake a domain controller.\n\n186\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.140\nWe still have to go\nthrough the configuration.\n\n187\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.797\nBut you guys knew that, right?\n\n188\n00:09:31.797 --> 00:09:34.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because we didn't answer anything like\n\n189\n00:09:34.211 --> 00:09:37.313\nis these the first domain\ncontroller in a new forest, or\n\n190\n00:09:37.313 --> 00:09:40.367\nis this a new domain controller\nin an existing domain?\n\n191\n00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:43.210\nNone of that was there, so-\n&gt;&gt; And we don't have like a chip\n\n192\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.800\nimplanted for telepathy or\nanything with our servers yet.\n\n193\n00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.478\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, that's coming,\nsoon, I'll be the first in line.\n\n194\n00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:51.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n195\n00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.740\nwe'll let this finish up.\n\n196\n00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.660\nWhat can we talk about while\nwe're waiting for that?\n\n197\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.250\nLet's see what else.\n\n198\n00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.304\nWhile this is going,\nwhy don't we flip over,\n\n199\n00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:03.580\ncuz we got a couple of other\nthings that we need to talk about.\n\n200\n00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.610\nOne is the global catalog, right?\n\n201\n00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.370\nAnd the global catalog, really I think for\n\n202\n00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:14.360\nthis exam, it's gonna be a lot about how\ndo I make it a global catalog or not?\n\n203\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.890\nBut I think you need to know what the\nglobal catalog is and the way this works.\n\n204\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.230\nActive Directory is a database, right?\n\n205\n00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.160\nAnd we can have multiple\ndomains in a forest.\n\n206\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.600\nAnd If we take domain A, for example,\nlet's say we've got domain A and domain B.\n\n207\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.790\nWell, if I'm a user in domain A,\nI can search\n\n208\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.370\ndomain A's Active Directory database and\nfind other objects like other users.\n\n209\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.730\nI want Cherokee's public certificate so\nthat I can verify a digital signature or\n\n210\n00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.680\nsend her some encrypted data,\nor I need to find a printer.\n\n211\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.600\nI can browse Active Directory.\n\n212\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.170\nI'm browsing domain A's Active Directory.\n\n213\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:57.228\nWhat if I wanna find a user in domain B,\nor a printer in domain B?\n\n214\n00:10:57.228 --> 00:11:01.100\nWell when I search Active Directory,\nI'm only searching domain A, right?\n\n215\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.940\nBecause that's the Active Directory\ndatabase that my domain is in charge of\n\n216\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.030\nand knows about.\n\n217\n00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.820\nI won't ever find users in domain B.\n\n218\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.811\nThe same thing for domain B,\nthey all find domain B stuff,\n\n219\n00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:14.370\nthey won't know anything\nabout domain A stuff.\n\n220\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:20.760\nA global catalog is an index for objects\nthroughout the entire forest, all right?\n\n221\n00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.530\nNow we've got a catalog, a phonebook,\n\n222\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.870\nif you will, of all the objects in the\nentire forest, both domain A and domain B.\n\n223\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.650\nThat's what a global catalog is.\n\n224\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.920\nIt contains all the objects in the forest.\n\n225\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.070\nWell, it contains all the objects and\na subset of the attributes.\n\n226\n00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.410\nIt actually doesn't contain every\nattribute for every object,\n\n227\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.510\ncuz then it would be too big, but\nthat's for a more detailed conversation.\n\n228\n00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.990\nBut what the global catalog\nallows me to do is find objects.\n\n229\n00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:51.030\nBecause if my domain controller is also\na global catalog server, not only does\n\n230\n00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:56.005\nit know about all of domain A's stuff,\nit also knows about domain B objects.\n\n231\n00:11:56.005 --> 00:12:00.265\nAnd so when I search, I can now\nfind that printer in domain B, or\n\n232\n00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:03.235\nI can find that user in domain B.\n\n233\n00:12:03.235 --> 00:12:05.815\nOr if there's a domain C or\ndomain D or domain E,\n\n234\n00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:10.300\nright, they're all gonna be part of\nthat global catalog within my forest.\n\n235\n00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.900\nSo each domain has their own\ndatabase that has their own objects.\n\n236\n00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.120\nA global catalog is an index of\nthe objects across the entire forest and\n\n237\n00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.650\nallows me to search for\nobjects throughout the entire forest.\n\n238\n00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.755\nHow do I know if my server's\na global catalog server?\n\n239\n00:12:24.755 --> 00:12:29.910\nOne, domain controllers are global catalog\nservers, but they don't have to be.\n\n240\n00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.850\nThey are by default,\n\n241\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.740\nwe saw that little check mark when\nwe went through the wizard, right?\n\n242\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.020\nIf I go into Active Directory Sites and\nServices, this is where I can change.\n\n243\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.629\nIf I want, maybe I don't want this\nguy to be a global catalog anymore,\n\n244\n00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:44.782\nthe replication is just too much for him.\n\n245\n00:12:44.782 --> 00:12:46.530\nCuz that is something to think about.\n\n246\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.420\nNow the domain controller,\nif it's a global catalog server,\n\n247\n00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.980\nit's replicating its own database for\nits domain.\n\n248\n00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.530\nAnd it's also replicating\nthe domain partitions for\n\n249\n00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.430\nevery other domain in your forest.\n\n250\n00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.410\nSo there's a lot of extra replication\ngoing on in global catalog servers, And\n\n251\n00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.990\nmore disk space being used for\n\n252\n00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:07.240\nthat database,\nwhich could potentially be an issue.\n\n253\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.200\nSo for example, if you had two domain\ncontrollers out in a branch office,\n\n254\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.820\nmaybe you don't want both of them\nbeing global catalog servers, or\n\n255\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.000\nmaybe you don't want any.\n\n256\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.390\nYou really need one, but maybe you don't.\n\n257\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.110\nSo how do you do it?\n\n258\n00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.261\nYou come into Active Directory Sites and\nServices,\n\n259\n00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:25.983\nyou find the site that your\ndomain controller's located in,\n\n260\n00:13:25.983 --> 00:13:30.075\nyou find your domain controller,\nand you go down to NTDS settings.\n\n261\n00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:31.970\nYou can right-click over here.\n\n262\n00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.690\nOr if I select the server,\n\n263\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.450\nI can right-click over here and\nchoose Properties.\n\n264\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.440\nAnd there's the check mark,\nright there, for Global Catalog.\n\n265\n00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.404\nIf it's not a global catalog server,\ncheck the check mark and click OK.\n\n266\n00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:46.388\nIt is now a global catalog server, and\n\n267\n00:13:46.388 --> 00:13:50.250\nit'll begin replicating all those\nother domains, domain partitions.\n\n268\n00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.910\nIf you uncheck it, It will no longer\nbe a global catalog server, and\n\n269\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.610\nit will no longer replicate those\nadditional partitions, all right?\n\n270\n00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:58.910\nSo that's global catalog.\n\n271\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.600\nHow we can determine which domain\ncontrollers are global catalog servers,\n\n272\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.860\nand how we can change it if we need to.\n\n273\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.730\nAll right, back over to core,\nlet's see how it's doing.\n\n274\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.120\nAnd looks like we're finished.\n\n275\n00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.050\nAll right, so we have Success,\nTrue, that's always a good thing.\n\n276\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.020\nRestart Needed?\n\n277\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.580\nNo, because we didn't do anything,\nall we did was unpack the roll.\n\n278\n00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.180\nExit Code, Success.\n\n279\n00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.330\nI do have a warning.\n\n280\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.580\nIt tells me that my automatic\nupdates are not enabled.\n\n281\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.360\nSo that's not a game ending type error,\nthat's just telling me, hey,\n\n282\n00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.200\nyou're not following best practices.\n\n283\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.120\nYou really need to turn\non Windows updates.\n\n284\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.355\nOkay, I promise I will, after this.\n\n285\n00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:37.874\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the real world,\n\n286\n00:14:37.874 --> 00:14:40.290\nturn on your Windows updates, of course.\n\n287\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.320\nAll right, so\nnow we have the role unpacked.\n\n288\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.240\nThink back to the GUI.\n\n289\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.720\nThis is how I like people to learn core.\n\n290\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.329\nThink about what you already know.\n\n291\n00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:48.697\n&gt;&gt; Associations, yeah.\n\n292\n00:14:48.697 --> 00:14:53.570\n&gt;&gt; And we're doing the same thing, just\nslightly different technique for doing it.\n\n293\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.670\nSo in the GUI, we went through the first\nwizard, which unpacked the role and\n\n294\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:57.970\ngot everything ready.\n\n295\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.265\nThen we launched the second wizard which\nis where I've made all my decisions and\n\n296\n00:15:02.265 --> 00:15:04.390\nactually made the domain controller.\n\n297\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.260\nOne command did what the first wizard did.\n\n298\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.970\nA second command is now gonna do what\nthat second wizard would do, and\n\n299\n00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.840\nit's going to depend on\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n300\n00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.430\nWhich I already mentioned this, right?\n\n301\n00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.635\nIf you're adding an additional domain\ncontroller to an existing domain,\n\n302\n00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:24.930\nInstall-ADDSDomainController.\n\n303\n00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:31.020\nIf you're creating a new domain in\nan existing forest, Install-ADDSDomain.\n\n304\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.030\nIf you're starting from scratch, and\nyou've got nothing, Install-ADDSForest.\n\n305\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.810\nSo we are doing the first of\nthe aforementioned commands.\n\n306\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:46.168\nSo Install-ADDSDomainController, right.\n\n307\n00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:50.660\nThat means, hey, add another domain\ncontroller to an existing domain.\n\n308\n00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.369\nIn the wizard, what did we have to do?\n\n309\n00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:55.671\nWe had to type in the name of the domain\nthat we wanted to add this additional\n\n310\n00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:56.754\ndomain controller to.\n\n311\n00:15:56.754 --> 00:15:58.054\nI'll do the same thing here.\n\n312\n00:15:58.054 --> 00:16:04.160\nAdd-DomainName Lab.ITPRO.tv, all right.\n\n313\n00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.292\nAnd then we came to that screen, do you\nwanna make it a global catalog server,\n\n314\n00:16:08.292 --> 00:16:09.701\ndo you wanna install DNS?\n\n315\n00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:15.080\nWell, we do.\n\n316\n00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.916\nInstall, not there, install-dns:$true,\n\n317\n00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:24.901\nthat was a little different from most\nparameters because it's a bully in and\n\n318\n00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:29.669\nI guess, no, instead of a space\nin the name of my domain, for\n\n319\n00:16:29.669 --> 00:16:33.710\nexample, it's column $ true or\ncolumn $ false.\n\n320\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:34.349\n&gt;&gt; False.\n\n321\n00:16:34.349 --> 00:16:36.935\n&gt;&gt; If you didn't want DNS on there, right?\n\n322\n00:16:36.935 --> 00:16:40.290\n&gt;&gt; And you could alternatively\ndoes omit that parameter\n\n323\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.360\nif the other word would be false also.\n\n324\n00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.612\nYou know I wanna say you have to do that,\n\n325\n00:16:44.612 --> 00:16:47.769\nI'd have to check the syntax\nto see if it was optional.\n\n326\n00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:49.194\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's a good question we can\n\n327\n00:16:49.194 --> 00:16:50.927\ncheck on that [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Microsoft,\n\n328\n00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.881\nthey put it on their Technet page for\nthese requirements there so.\n\n329\n00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:56.954\n&gt;&gt; In fact, if I tab through,\nwe'll see the other options,\n\n330\n00:16:56.954 --> 00:17:00.283\nlike there's safe mode\nadministrator password, site name,\n\n331\n00:17:00.283 --> 00:17:04.652\nthese are all drop down lists you should\nremember from the wizard we went through.\n\n332\n00:17:04.652 --> 00:17:05.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n333\n00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.890\n&gt;&gt; Credentials,\nwe're gonna have to apply those.\n\n334\n00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.940\nChanging the location of the files.\n\n335\n00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.090\nCreate DNS delegation,\n\n336\n00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:16.270\nwhich we couldn't do because we\ndidn't have Internet access, right?\n\n337\n00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.960\nWe're back to credential.\n\n338\n00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.200\nCritical replication only.\n\n339\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.700\nChange the database path.\n\n340\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.340\nDNS delegation credentials.\n\n341\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:28.130\nSo all the things that are in the wizard\nare in this command as parameters.\n\n342\n00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.430\nYou just have to know which ones\nare required and which ones are optional.\n\n343\n00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.250\nSo let's do credentials.\n\n344\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.910\nCuz we are gonna need credentials.\n\n345\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:38.730\nWho am I?\n\n346\n00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.270\nI need to be at least a domain admin\nto add a new domain controller to\n\n347\n00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.310\nan existing domain.\n\n348\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:50.998\nSo I'm not gonna type in my username and\npassword in my PowerShell.\n\n349\n00:17:50.998 --> 00:17:55.790\nI'm gonna Get-Credential,\nwhich is gonna give me a secure\n\n350\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.120\nway to provide credentials, because if\nsomebody was standing over my shoulder\n\n351\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.510\nwatching me or walking by,\nthey could see what I was typing, and\n\n352\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.640\nI'd be giving them the domain admin\npassword and that would not be good.\n\n353\n00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.370\nRight.\n\n354\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.610\nSo we hit enter, and it says,\nhey, supply those credentials.\n\n355\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.510\nCareful with this one, all right.\n\n356\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.030\nDepending on your dialogue box,\n\n357\n00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:19.760\nthis one does not have the name of my\ndomain listed underneath here, right.\n\n358\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.180\nOne, because this guy's not part of,\nactually he is part of the domain,\n\n359\n00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.740\nbut it just doesn't have it.\n\n360\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.380\nSometimes the name of\nthe domain is down there.\n\n361\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.610\nAnd then when you provide the username,\n\n362\n00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.170\nyou don't have to specify the domain,\nit's assumed or understood.\n\n363\n00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:36.050\nThis one does not, so you will need to\ntype lab/administrator, in my case, or\n\n364\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.120\nwhatever yours is.\n\n365\n00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.830\nProvide the appropriate password.\n\n366\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.130\nAnd then I didn't provide safe mode\nadministrator password from the cmdlet.\n\n367\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.900\nI didn't use that parameter.\n\n368\n00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.770\nAnd it's telling me, hey,\nbuddy, that's required.\n\n369\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.010\nSo notice, it prompted me for it.\n\n370\n00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.020\nIt's not gonna let me go on,\nunless I provide that.\n\n371\n00:18:57.432 --> 00:18:58.390\nAll right.\n\n372\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.320\nAnd it does at least hide my values there.\n\n373\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.730\nAll right, and now, it's telling me,\ndo you wanna continue?\n\n374\n00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.267\nA reboot is required, just like at\nthe end of our wizard, are you sure?\n\n375\n00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:15.113\nYou're gonna have to reboot, and\nwe'll say, Yes to all, or Y for Yes,\n\n376\n00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:16.474\nA for All, I guess.\n\n377\n00:19:16.474 --> 00:19:20.007\nA for yes to All, and\nthat's gonna go through the process,\n\n378\n00:19:20.007 --> 00:19:24.925\nand it'll reboot, and when it comes back\nup, I should have a domain controller.\n\n379\n00:19:24.925 --> 00:19:25.850\nAll right.\n\n380\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.680\nSame warnings that I get in the GUI\nabout the older operating systems and\n\n381\n00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.420\nthe security level.\n\n382\n00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.396\nI'll probably get a DNS delegation issue,\n\n383\n00:19:35.396 --> 00:19:38.780\nonce this moves on to\nthe step of installing a DNS.\n\n384\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:45.557\nAll right, so let there go there is my,\nyep, let's see, it's gone, it's gone.\n\n385\n00:19:45.557 --> 00:19:48.259\nAll right, so Cherokee,\nwhile this is finishing up,\n\n386\n00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:51.431\nI know we've got a couple other\ntopics that we wanted to cover and\n\n387\n00:19:51.431 --> 00:19:53.775\nyou're telling me we\ndon't wanna part five.\n\n388\n00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:55.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It would be a part five.\n\n389\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:55.872\n&gt;&gt; It would be a part five.\n\n390\n00:19:55.872 --> 00:19:58.493\nSo we'll- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Do we talk about upgrading a domain\n\n391\n00:19:58.493 --> 00:19:59.168\ncontroller?\n\n392\n00:19:59.168 --> 00:19:59.816\nI don't remember.\n\n393\n00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:00.603\n&gt;&gt; We didn't.\n\n394\n00:20:00.603 --> 00:20:01.492\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n395\n00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:03.952\n&gt;&gt; We'll see about that, yes, don't do it.\n\n396\n00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:04.944\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What else you wanna talk about?\n\n397\n00:20:04.944 --> 00:20:08.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so well then why would we or\n\n398\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.740\nwould we not wanna do, right?\n\n399\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.450\n&gt;&gt; It's something that we definitely\nshould talk about, is exam material.\n\n400\n00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.390\nWhen I say that I'm being\na little bit facetious.\n\n401\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.430\nUpgrading a domain controller is,\nhonestly,\n\n402\n00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:25.030\nno different than upgrading any other\nmachine, as far as the procedure goes.\n\n403\n00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.540\nI have a 2008 domain controller.\n\n404\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.760\nI was gonna show you guys, but I'm getting\nthe eye like I might not have enough time.\n\n405\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.800\nBut it's really not exciting to see,\nright?\n\n406\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.290\nYou go to your 2008 R2 domain controller,\nyou pop in the media or\n\n407\n00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.172\nyou mount the ISO or whatever it is you're\ndoing, and you run it, you run the setup.\n\n408\n00:20:41.172 --> 00:20:42.738\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Select upgrade, yeah.\n\n409\n00:20:42.738 --> 00:20:44.162\n&gt;&gt; And when you go through the wizard,\n\n410\n00:20:44.162 --> 00:20:46.310\nyou choose Upgrade instead\nof doing a clean install.\n\n411\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.440\nAll your applications and\neverything should still be there.\n\n412\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.240\nSo the question is,\ncan I do that on the domain controller?\n\n413\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.060\nAbsolutely.\n\n414\n00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.805\nYou can upgrade a domain controller.\n\n415\n00:20:54.805 --> 00:20:55.572\n&gt;&gt; Should I?\n\n416\n00:20:55.572 --> 00:20:57.990\n&gt;&gt; Active directory will still\nbe there when you're done.\n\n417\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.518\nAnd it'll be a domain controller.\n\n418\n00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:01.989\nShould you?\n\n419\n00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:07.860\nWell, I will say, in my personal,\nwhat is it, IMHO, right.\n\n420\n00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.604\nIn my-\n&gt;&gt; Honest?\n\n421\n00:21:08.604 --> 00:21:11.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Humble opinion, no.\n\n422\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.250\nThere's definitely gonna be cases where,\nit's your best option.\n\n423\n00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.630\nSo I'm not gonna say never do it, right?\n\n424\n00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.347\nThere's gonna be times when\nthe upgrade is the most logical path.\n\n425\n00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:24.714\n&gt;&gt; And I mean, if you think about it,\ntaking that one jump, it might not be so\n\n426\n00:21:24.714 --> 00:21:25.780\ncatastrophic.\n\n427\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.420\nBut then once you start seeing\nmultiple iterations, and\n\n428\n00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.730\nyou're going through several of\nthose iterations and moving and\n\n429\n00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.580\nprogressing forward in time, that's where\nthings can get really hairy, right?\n\n430\n00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.220\n&gt;&gt; I tell you, I'm old school, so\nI've been around Microsoft and\n\n431\n00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.680\ndealing with upgrades for\na long time, and in the past,\n\n432\n00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.220\nit was definitely not as nice and\ntidy as it is now.\n\n433\n00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.330\nWhen you're upgrading from one\noperating system to another,\n\n434\n00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.124\nall dlls might have got left\nin place that shouldn't be.\n\n435\n00:21:53.124 --> 00:21:56.290\nOr dlls got over written that\nshouldn't have been, I mean,\n\n436\n00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.160\nweird little corky things would happen,\nand so\n\n437\n00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.830\nyou have these upgraded machines\nthat just didn't behave right.\n\n438\n00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:05.478\nAnd most of it could be traced back to\nissues during the upgrade with things,\n\n439\n00:22:05.478 --> 00:22:08.790\ngetting replaced or not getting\nreplaced in, and things like that.\n\n440\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.230\nSo the rule of thumb was,\nonly upgrade if you have to.\n\n441\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.499\nYou're always better off\ndoing clean install.\n\n442\n00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:17.996\nI will say with these modern\noperating systems, 2008,\n\n443\n00:22:17.996 --> 00:22:21.715\n2012, and on, the upgrades aren't as bad.\n\n444\n00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:25.255\nI haven't seen nearly as many\nissues with upgraded machines.\n\n445\n00:22:25.255 --> 00:22:29.175\nThat being said, honestly-\n&gt;&gt; You've got tools that provide\n\n446\n00:22:29.175 --> 00:22:31.695\nmigration tools, and\nyou're starting fresh.\n\n447\n00:22:31.695 --> 00:22:34.596\nIt's like getting a hair cut, or\nhaving clean sheets, or a clean car.\n\n448\n00:22:34.596 --> 00:22:35.915\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most of the time.\n\n449\n00:22:35.915 --> 00:22:37.700\nAnd most of the time,\nwe're replacing physical hardware,\n\n450\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.860\nthat's why we're doing the upgrade.\n\n451\n00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.615\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n452\n00:22:40.615 --> 00:22:44.360\n&gt;&gt; So I'm not gonna bother, we're trying\nto upgrade an old piece of hardware.\n\n453\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.380\nWith virtualization, though, that's\nchanged a lot, and now maybe the need for\n\n454\n00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.010\nupgrade or the desire to do\nan upgrade is a little more, or\n\n455\n00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:57.060\nis it the opposite cuz I can spit\nup a new 2012 R2 VM like that, and\n\n456\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.240\njust turn off by 2008 R2 VM, right?\n\n457\n00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.560\nSo I don't know, what I'll say\nis upgrade paths are important.\n\n458\n00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:11.219\nWe can go from 2008 to, there's direct\nupgrade path from 2008 to 2012.\n\n459\n00:23:11.219 --> 00:23:13.760\nYou do have to pay\nattention to your versions.\n\n460\n00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.660\nStandard to standard,\ndata center to data center.\n\n461\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.860\nYou can go down but\nyou typically can't go up, right?\n\n462\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.000\nI can't go from data\ncenter back to standard.\n\n463\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.284\nSo I can't go down,\n\n464\n00:23:25.284 --> 00:23:28.416\nI can go up because I'm gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Think about the licensing\n\n465\n00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:31.051\nthere too because-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I wanna get features that I didn't\n\n466\n00:23:31.051 --> 00:23:32.850\npay for it's not gonna work type thing.\n\n467\n00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.158\nSo upgrades, I think what I would\nleave it at is, yes you can,\n\n468\n00:23:38.158 --> 00:23:42.219\njust do it like any other upgrade,\nactive directory will still be there when\n\n469\n00:23:42.219 --> 00:23:44.983\nyou are done with the upgrade,\n&gt;&gt; Backup first.\n\n470\n00:23:44.983 --> 00:23:48.640\n&gt;&gt; Back up first,\n&gt;&gt; But honestly, is it worth it?\n\n471\n00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.610\nWell, it's gonna depend on your scenario.\n\n472\n00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:56.582\nIt's just as easy in my opinion to,\nespecially if it's virtualized,\n\n473\n00:23:56.582 --> 00:24:00.993\nbuild it brand new from scratch via,\ninstall 2012 R2 on it.\n\n474\n00:24:00.993 --> 00:24:04.505\nBring it up, let it replicate from\nthe other domain controllers.\n\n475\n00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:08.420\nAnd at least if I have to troubleshoot,\nI can rule out the upgrade, right?\n\n476\n00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.310\nIt's not even a possibility that,\nthat's causing a problem.\n\n477\n00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.190\nThat's my personal opinion,\nI would stay away from upgrades.\n\n478\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.430\nBut like I said, it can be done.\n\n479\n00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.573\nSo for the exam,\nunderstand, you can do it.\n\n480\n00:24:21.573 --> 00:24:23.713\nAnd you don't have to\nreinstall Active Directory,\n\n481\n00:24:23.713 --> 00:24:25.540\neverything should still be there.\n\n482\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:31.020\nData files, the Active Directory database,\nall of that stuff should be just fine.\n\n483\n00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.870\nSo I guess you can and should you do it?\n\n484\n00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.170\nI'll leave that one up to you.\n\n485\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.200\nAll right, so core has rebooted.\n\n486\n00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.620\nLet's see what we got here.\n\n487\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.800\nNotice now I'm being asked\nto log in to the domain,\n\n488\n00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.480\nwhich actually it was\na domain member already.\n\n489\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:52.270\nSo let's go ahead and log in,\nand we'll run that little\n\n490\n00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:57.018\ncommand just to make sure we are good and\nwe will check one more place as well.\n\n491\n00:24:57.018 --> 00:25:03.845\nWe'll do PowerShell,\nthat is not how you spell it.\n\n492\n00:25:03.845 --> 00:25:08.721\nAnd we do get-windowsFeature,\nl can spell it\n\n493\n00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:13.734\nout before the tab fill complete,\nthere we go.\n\n494\n00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:17.508\nAnd we just give it a second, and\nlet's see if Active Directory is listed.\n\n495\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.412\nSorry, I get impatient when I\nstart messing with my mouse wheel.\n\n496\n00:25:23.412 --> 00:25:24.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was gonna say,\n\n497\n00:25:24.375 --> 00:25:27.945\nthis time we could have use the wild cards\nthough to kind of narrow that filter down.\n\n498\n00:25:27.945 --> 00:25:29.579\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we should have.\n\n499\n00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:33.233\nAnd there we go, Active Directory\nDomain Services is installed.\n\n500\n00:25:33.233 --> 00:25:35.864\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can also do what we did on our other\n\n501\n00:25:35.864 --> 00:25:37.053\nmachines, right?\n\n502\n00:25:37.053 --> 00:25:43.664\nI could go into C:\\Windows\\NTDS,\n\n503\n00:25:43.664 --> 00:25:48.007\nand I could look in here.\n\n504\n00:25:48.007 --> 00:25:49.882\nAnd I could see that I\nhave my NTDS database.\n\n505\n00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:51.447\nI could go into.\n\n506\n00:25:51.447 --> 00:25:53.342\nI can make sure those are there as well.\n\n507\n00:25:53.342 --> 00:25:57.582\nI can go back over to my other,\nmy domain controller with a GUI, right?\n\n508\n00:25:57.582 --> 00:26:00.506\nAnd I can open up Active Directory\nusers and computers.\n\n509\n00:26:00.506 --> 00:26:05.574\nAnd I can see that core is now\nin my domain controllers OU,\n\n510\n00:26:05.574 --> 00:26:09.320\nso we are good to go there, all right?\n\n511\n00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.590\nSo there even small Active Directory\non a domain controller.\n\n512\n00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.230\nLast but not least, and\n\n513\n00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.500\nthen I promise we'll give up\nthe ghost of Active Directory here.\n\n514\n00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.279\n&gt;&gt; DNS records, yeah?\n\n515\n00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:20.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes, DNS records.\n\n516\n00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:21.940\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n517\n00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.720\n&gt;&gt; So we've got these domain controllers.\n\n518\n00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.690\nThey are doing all the authentication,\nwhen you log on you have to contact\n\n519\n00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.860\na domain controller to verify\nyou've typed in the right password,\n\n520\n00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.550\nget your tokens, so you can access\nresources, all that good stuff.\n\n521\n00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.410\nWe have to be able to find\nthe domain controllers.\n\n522\n00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.910\nWhen domain controllers talk to\neach other, when they replicate,\n\n523\n00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.470\nthey have to find each other.\n\n524\n00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:43.390\nThey know the name of their replication\npartner, but they've gotta use DNS to look\n\n525\n00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:47.760\nup the IP address, so they can make the\nconnection and do the replication, right?\n\n526\n00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.800\nSo as I said, DNS and Active Directory\ntightly, tightly integrated.\n\n527\n00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.970\nWhen you create a domain controller it\ncreates several DNS records above and\n\n528\n00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:00.600\nbeyond the normal A record, the host\nrecord, or the quantity record for IPv6.\n\n529\n00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.330\nWe also get what's known as SRV records,\nservice locator records.\n\n530\n00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.400\nThese are records that publish or\nadvertise the fact that, hey,\n\n531\n00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.436\nthis is my name and\nI'm providing this service.\n\n532\n00:27:13.436 --> 00:27:15.108\nSo when you go to log on to your machine,\n\n533\n00:27:15.108 --> 00:27:17.260\nit doesn't just contact\nthe domain controller.\n\n534\n00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.265\nWhen you sit down at\nyour Windows 8.1 box and\n\n535\n00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:24.272\nyou control all delete to log in,\nit queries DNS and says hey,\n\n536\n00:27:24.272 --> 00:27:29.750\nI need to find a server that's running\nKerberos, so that I can authenticate.\n\n537\n00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:34.508\nCan you tell me the IP address of\nany server that's running Kerberos?\n\n538\n00:27:34.508 --> 00:27:36.789\nDNS looks at the SRV records and says,\n\n539\n00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:40.149\nwhich servers have told me\nthey're running Kerberos.\n\n540\n00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:43.960\nAnd then returns a list of IP addresses of\nall the servers that are running Kerberos.\n\n541\n00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.300\nAnd that could be modified slightly\nwith sites and things like that, but\n\n542\n00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.890\nthat's the basic process.\n\n543\n00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.320\nIf my domain controller doesn't\ncreate those records properly,\n\n544\n00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.640\nwe're gonna have a problem.\n\n545\n00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.810\nNobody can find it to\nauthenticate with it.\n\n546\n00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.220\nNobody can replicate with it.\n\n547\n00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.170\nWe're gonna have all kinds\nof replication errors that\n\n548\n00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.090\nwe're gonna have to go through and\ntroubleshoot.\n\n549\n00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.580\nSo it's very important that we verify\nthat my domain controllers create\n\n550\n00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.320\nthe appropriate records, and\n\n551\n00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.740\nknow how to fix it If they don't,\nor if something goes wrong.\n\n552\n00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.780\nSo we can do this, we got enough time.\n\n553\n00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.856\nI'm gonna open up DNS, And\n\n554\n00:28:20.856 --> 00:28:24.599\nI'm gonna navigate into\nmy Forward Lookup Zone.\n\n555\n00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:27.894\nAnd I'm gonna take a look at,\nit doesn't matter where really,\n\n556\n00:28:27.894 --> 00:28:30.470\nwe'll use TCP I guess for this example.\n\n557\n00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.210\nThese are all the SRV records.\n\n558\n00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:36.010\nNow I have, did you guys count,\nwhen I was over there?\n\n559\n00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:39.060\nI have four domain controllers.\n\n560\n00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.100\nDC01, DC08, Server 1, and Core 1,\n\n561\n00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:47.240\nwhich is why you're seeing four for\neach of these.\n\n562\n00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.210\nNotice there's a global catalog record.\n\n563\n00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.100\nHey, my name's DC01 and\nI'm global catalog server if you need me.\n\n564\n00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.930\nThere's a Kerberos SRV record,\nthere's a kpasswd record, and\n\n565\n00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.220\nan LDAP record, Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol record.\n\n566\n00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.290\nSo these are being registered, so like for\nexample, if I sort these by data.\n\n567\n00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.900\nLet's see if I can get the names.\n\n568\n00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.620\nI can't, it's all done by,\nit's got those codes down in front, so\n\n569\n00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.200\nI can't really sort it by name,\nin this particular view.\n\n570\n00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.110\nBut anyway,\nthese are the records that creates, so\n\n571\n00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:24.180\nthat other machines can find the machines\nthat are running as domain controllers.\n\n572\n00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.569\nSo the question then is,\nwhat happens if these don't get created or\n\n573\n00:29:27.569 --> 00:29:29.005\nsomething happens to them?\n\n574\n00:29:29.005 --> 00:29:33.858\nFor example, I am going to take all of\nthe DC1 records, not all the records,\n\n575\n00:29:33.858 --> 00:29:38.293\nI could just take all of them,\nwhat the heck, no, let's not do that.\n\n576\n00:29:38.293 --> 00:29:41.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll take all the DC1 records, right?\n\n577\n00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.300\nAll four of these records and no,\n\n578\n00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.576\nI just deleted them,\nwhatever am I going to do Cherokee?\n\n579\n00:29:48.576 --> 00:29:51.943\nAnd that would,\nseriously it would not be good day, right?\n\n580\n00:29:51.943 --> 00:29:55.272\nBecause now other machines\nare not gonna be aware,\n\n581\n00:29:55.272 --> 00:29:58.769\nthat this domain controller\nis a domain controller.\n\n582\n00:29:58.769 --> 00:30:01.040\nAll its SRV records are gone.\n\n583\n00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.431\nWhat creates these records is\nthe Net Logon service, all right?\n\n584\n00:30:05.431 --> 00:30:10.297\nNet Logon is responsible when you start\nup a domain controller, there's actually\n\n585\n00:30:10.297 --> 00:30:14.814\na file that it reads and it tells it what\nrecords it should register with DNS and\n\n586\n00:30:14.814 --> 00:30:17.815\nit goes to the process\nof registering those.\n\n587\n00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:22.688\nSo really restarting this domain\ncontroller would fix my problem, okay?\n\n588\n00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:26.414\nBecause it would do it's normal thing,\nit would boot up,\n\n589\n00:30:26.414 --> 00:30:30.383\nthen it would run the Net Logon\nservice and it would register.\n\n590\n00:30:30.383 --> 00:30:32.248\nBut if this is a production environment,\n\n591\n00:30:32.248 --> 00:30:35.555\nthe ability to restart the domain\ncontroller is gonna be determined by one\n\n592\n00:30:35.555 --> 00:30:38.490\nwhat others services that\nare a running on it, availability.\n\n593\n00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.300\nThere's a lot of things that\ncan prevent me from just\n\n594\n00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.250\nwilly nilly rebooting a domain\ncontroller in the middle of the day.\n\n595\n00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:49.980\nSo if I need to,\nwhat I can do is net stock net logon.\n\n596\n00:30:51.948 --> 00:30:55.630\nAnd it will tell you that you need\nto be an administrator to do that.\n\n597\n00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.413\nSo we'll close that command prompt,\nand we'll run it as an administrator.\n\n598\n00:30:59.413 --> 00:31:02.186\n&gt;&gt; I'm still trying to\nget over the willy nilly.\n\n599\n00:31:02.186 --> 00:31:02.694\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\n\n600\n00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:04.294\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n601\n00:31:04.294 --> 00:31:06.614\n&gt;&gt; And we'll do net stop,\n\n602\n00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:11.370\nnet logon I don't know why\nI just like that word.\n\n603\n00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.818\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's crazy.\n&gt;&gt; It's just fun to say,\n\n604\n00:31:12.818 --> 00:31:14.477\nsay it with me everybody willy nilly.\n\n605\n00:31:14.477 --> 00:31:16.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think my mom used to say it,\n\n606\n00:31:16.786 --> 00:31:18.093\nand you're running around willy nilly.\n\n607\n00:31:18.093 --> 00:31:20.427\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know where it\n\n608\n00:31:20.427 --> 00:31:21.077\ncame from.\n\n609\n00:31:21.077 --> 00:31:24.074\nAll right, and there we successfully\nstop to the Net Logon service.\n\n610\n00:31:24.074 --> 00:31:25.737\nAnd now I'm just gonna restart it.\n\n611\n00:31:25.737 --> 00:31:28.370\nI'm gonna do net start.\n\n612\n00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.300\nIf I could type Net Logon.\n\n613\n00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.640\nAll I'm doing is restarting\nthat log on service.\n\n614\n00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.065\nI could go into the service's console,\nright-click on Net Logon and\n\n615\n00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:41.600\nchoose restart, right?\n\n616\n00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.420\nThe important thing is for\nyou to remember,\n\n617\n00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.140\nNet Logon is the service responsible for\ngenerating those DNS records.\n\n618\n00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.780\nThat's really what you gotta remember.\n\n619\n00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.430\nIt would be helpful to\nknow how to restart that.\n\n620\n00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.990\nLike I said, it's a good thing.\n\n621\n00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.972\nSo I restarted it,\nlet's see if it fix my problem.\n\n622\n00:31:58.972 --> 00:32:06.020\nWell, I refresh my TCP and look at there,\nDC1 has four records again.\n\n623\n00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.663\nBecause once that service restarted,\nit did its job, and it went out and\n\n624\n00:32:09.663 --> 00:32:11.160\nregistered those records.\n\n625\n00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.872\nSo that my friends, I think,\nis what we need to know for this exam for\n\n626\n00:32:15.872 --> 00:32:19.275\ninstalling Active\nDirectory Domain Services.\n\n627\n00:32:19.275 --> 00:32:21.587\nAll in our nice little bow in four parts.\n\n628\n00:32:21.587 --> 00:32:23.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n629\n00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, thank you so much for\n\n630\n00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.290\nthat, for being with us

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.358\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:11.801\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:15.540\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.670\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.940\nAnd we are continuing\non our journey to well,\n\n9\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.909\nlearn more about\nMicrosoft Windows Server 2012.\n\n10\n00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.626\nIn particular, we're gonna be looking\nat Active Directory Users and\n\n11\n00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:27.370\nComputers today.\n\n12\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.138\nAnd luckily, we have the man with the plan\nin the studio today, Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n13\n00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:32.310\nHow are you doing today today, Mike?\n\n14\n00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.080\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n15\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.439\nDon't know if I really have a plan, but\nwe'll have some fun either way, right?\n\n16\n00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:38.382\n&gt;&gt; Well I hope you do,\ncuz I definitely don't.\n\n17\n00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:40.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, thanks for\nhaving me, Justin.\n\n18\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.248\nAnd yeah, excited as always,\nwe are gonna be talking about,\n\n19\n00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:46.211\nnot really Active Directory,\nthat's the way I titled the show.\n\n20\n00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:48.490\nBut I know some of you are thinking,\nwait, the console?\n\n21\n00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.006\nNo, we really wanna look at Active\nDirectory and user objects and computer\n\n22\n00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.690\nobjects but all that wouldn't fit on the\nscreen so I shortened it up a little bit.\n\n23\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.570\nBut we will be using Active Directory\nusers to computers to work with users and\n\n24\n00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.265\ncomputers within Active Directory,\nso it works out in the end, I think.\n\n25\n00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:07.660\n[LAUGH] All right, so let's talk about,\n\n26\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.820\nwe've spent a few days getting\nActive Directory installed, or\n\n27\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.280\na few episodes getting it installed,\ngetting it all configured.\n\n28\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.744\nAnd now what do we do with it, right?\n\n29\n00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:17.230\nWe've gotta work with the objects\nwithin Active Directory.\n\n30\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.810\nAnd one of the primary object types of\ncourse is going to be user accounts,\n\n31\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.360\nas well as computer accounts.\n\n32\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.390\nWe have to have an object in Active\nDirectory that's gonna represent a user or\n\n33\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.700\nrepresent a computer.\n\n34\n00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.296\nWhen you log in, right, you're mapping.\n\n35\n00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:36.943\nYou're basically you're saying, I am that\nuser account and we have user account.\n\n36\n00:01:36.943 --> 00:01:40.590\nA good question, I guess, to start\nus off here, our thought processes.\n\n37\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.029\nWhy do we even have to have user accounts?\n\n38\n00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:45.930\nWhy don't we just have machines\nthat are logged in and\n\n39\n00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.990\nwe don't have any user accounts?\n\n40\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.915\n&gt;&gt; So what I should do is I should set\nup all the machines in the office space.\n\n41\n00:01:51.915 --> 00:01:55.330\nAll of them have, I don't know,\nwe'll call it admin, as the user account.\n\n42\n00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.410\nThey're always logged in,\neverybody has super escalated privileges.\n\n43\n00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.912\nWhat's the worst that could\npossible happen, right, Mike?\n\n44\n00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:04.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\na nuclear weapons launch, I don't know.\n\n45\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.810\nWho knows what could happen at that point,\ndelete the entire directory, yeah,\n\n46\n00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.940\nnot a good thing, right?\n\n47\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.100\nWe use user accounts to help us administer\nand control our users' access, right?\n\n48\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.214\nAnd this is something that you guys\ncan relate to even if you're not in\n\n49\n00:02:19.214 --> 00:02:21.213\nthe field yet or you're just starting out.\n\n50\n00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:22.375\nThink about your home computer.\n\n51\n00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:25.875\nHow many of you out there have a machine\nat home that just stays logged in?\n\n52\n00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:29.255\nAnd everybody in the family just\nsits down and uses the computer.\n\n53\n00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:32.250\nAnd that's fine in your house where\nyou've got physical security, right?\n\n54\n00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.125\nNot too many people can get into\nyour house and access your computer.\n\n55\n00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:41.225\nBut the downside of doing a scenario like\nthat is you have no accountability, right?\n\n56\n00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:42.945\nWhat if a file turns up missing?\n\n57\n00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:44.750\nOr somebody deleted a picture?\n\n58\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.610\nWho did it?\n\n59\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.999\nWas it you or you?\n\n60\n00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.394\nYou're pointing at the kids.\n\n61\n00:02:48.394 --> 00:02:51.235\nYou have no way of knowing because\neverybody's logged on with the same\n\n62\n00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:53.820\naccount so\nthere is no accountability with that.\n\n63\n00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.850\nAnd I can't control any levels of access.\n\n64\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.510\nI can't say,\n\n65\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.280\nBilly can't be on the computer after\n9 PM because he's got homework to do.\n\n66\n00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.046\nBecause there's no way to differentiate\nBilly from anybody else in the family when\n\n67\n00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.297\nthey access that machine.\n\n68\n00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:08.700\nAnd that's the same concept when\nwe come into a workplace, right?\n\n69\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.360\nWe have user accounts so\nthat we have that accountability.\n\n70\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.500\nAnd we have that ability\nto control access.\n\n71\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.720\nWhen you log on with your user account,\n\n72\n00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.300\nyour user account is given a certain set\nof permissions and rights over different\n\n73\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.633\nobjects throughout the enterprise\nbased on that user account, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:30.236\nAnd I can now control whether or not\nyou're allowed to access this resource or\n\n75\n00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:31.320\nthat resource.\n\n76\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.080\nAnd because Justin, for example, has\na different user account, I can allow him\n\n77\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.580\naccess but still deny me access because\nwe have different accounts there.\n\n78\n00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.750\nWhen I go to look at log files,\n\n79\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.750\nif we're doing auditing,\nI can see who modified that file.\n\n80\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.220\nI can see who accidentally deleted that\nfolder and didn't wanna tell anybody.\n\n81\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.040\nBecause I could look in the log files and\nI can see,\n\n82\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.680\nJay Dennison deleted this resource at\n8:42 AM, right, I can see that in there.\n\n83\n00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.210\nThat's because we have\nthose user accounts.\n\n84\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.340\n&gt;&gt; And Mike, correct me if I'm wrong, but\nalso this keeps me, let's say, I have\n\n85\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.880\na particular role, I have a database\nadministrator role or something like that.\n\n86\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.320\nSo I have access to those resources, but\nI'm trying to do some kind of manipulation\n\n87\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.540\nand as a byproduct,\nI mess with another resource.\n\n88\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.780\nBut having a user account that\nhas that resource limited to me\n\n89\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.730\nkind of keeps things from, whoops,\n\n90\n00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.380\nI accidentally deleted some stuff that\nMike needed for his particular role.\n\n91\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.890\nAnd then we don't have to\nworry about that, correct?\n\n92\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.800\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n93\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.910\nWe got that control where we\ncan be as granular as we want\n\n94\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.910\nwith their level of access.\n\n95\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.885\nAll right so now,\n\n96\n00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:38.981\nwe've gotta we understand a general\nidea of what these user accounts are,\n\n97\n00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:43.807\ntheir objects, and Active Directory, why\nwe have them and why they're so important.\n\n98\n00:04:43.807 --> 00:04:46.451\nThe computers have accounts\njust like users do.\n\n99\n00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.161\nWe're gonna focus on users first and\n\n100\n00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:50.490\nprobably come back around\nto computer accounts.\n\n101\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.350\nBut understand the computers have\naccounts and Active Directory as well.\n\n102\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.400\nWhen you join a computer to the domain,\nwhat you're really doing is creating\n\n103\n00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.910\nan object that represents that\ncomputer in Active Directory.\n\n104\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.990\nI now know that that computer is part\nof my domain and I have the same thing,\n\n105\n00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.240\nI have accountability.\n\n106\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.940\nI can see what computer Justin used when\nhe accidentally deleted that folder.\n\n107\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.930\nI can see what workstation he was\nsitting at or I can control access,\n\n108\n00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.110\nthose laptops are allowed to\nremote in from the outside.\n\n109\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.080\nOr you can only access\nthese certain resources\n\n110\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.000\nif you're at a desktop that's\nin the finance office.\n\n111\n00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.180\nIf you go anywhere else, you're not\nallowed to access those payroll reports,\n\n112\n00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.230\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n113\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.340\nSo it's just as important that we\nunderstand that computers have accounts in\n\n114\n00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.080\nActive Directory as well, all right.\n\n115\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.860\nSo now, how do we create this accounts?\n\n116\n00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.304\nLet's take a look at the couple\nof different tools we have\n\n117\n00:05:41.304 --> 00:05:44.476\nto work with manage this user and\ncomputer account.\n\n118\n00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:46.942\nSo we are gonna start with the classic,\n\n119\n00:05:46.942 --> 00:05:51.516\neverybody's favorite good old\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n120\n00:05:51.516 --> 00:05:56.295\nADUC, some people like to call it A-D-U-C,\nI personally really don't like that.\n\n121\n00:05:56.295 --> 00:05:59.160\n[LAUGH] But hey,\nit's whatever you wanna do.\n\n122\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.650\nBut Active Directory Users and\n\n123\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.530\nComputers is our access to\nthe Active Directory database.\n\n124\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.430\nRight, this is our interface that\nwe use to manipulate those user and\n\n125\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.000\ncomputer objects within Active Directory.\n\n126\n00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.110\nCuz remember,\nall of this is stored In that NTDS.DIT,\n\n127\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.910\nthat database that gets created when\nwe first install Active Directory.\n\n128\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.550\nAnd we're gonna talk a lot about in\na future episode here about the OUs and\n\n129\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.730\nthe containers and the structure and\nhow we organize all of this.\n\n130\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.910\nCuz that plays a big part in the way we\napply group policy and delegate control.\n\n131\n00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.750\nBut for now,\nlet's just kind of ignore that and\n\n132\n00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.371\njust focus in on the objects themselves\nthat we're going to be working with.\n\n133\n00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:43.941\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look in this hosts OU,\n\n134\n00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.864\nI have a few user accounts\nthat I've already created.\n\n135\n00:06:47.864 --> 00:06:50.132\nJustin, I did not make you one, so\nwe're gonna have to make you one.\n\n136\n00:06:50.132 --> 00:06:53.304\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike, you must have known\nI'm not a big Windows user, so\n\n137\n00:06:53.304 --> 00:06:55.440\nyou're like, I'll just leave him out.\n\n138\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n139\n00:06:56.921 --> 00:06:58.970\nSo let's take a look here\nat Daniel's user account.\n\n140\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.100\nAll I did was double-click on it,\nyou can right-click properties, and\n\n141\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.160\nyou can see that there are several tabs\nof information that we can look at.\n\n142\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.300\nNow do keep in mind,\nI think I already turned this on.\n\n143\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.040\nI'm gonna uncheck this for a second,\nand then explain what I just did.\n\n144\n00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.940\nWhen we go into the default\nview of Active Directory, and\n\n145\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.970\nI take a look at Daniel's user account,\nall right.\n\n146\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.557\nWe're going to see there's what,\nthree rows of tabs here and\n\n147\n00:07:22.557 --> 00:07:24.110\nlet's take a look what we have here.\n\n148\n00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.514\nWe've got General tab,\nwe've got things like First name,\n\n149\n00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:30.794\nLast name, Display name,\nDescription, Office, etc.\n\n150\n00:07:30.794 --> 00:07:34.634\nWe've got an address sheet where we can\nfill in information about the office\n\n151\n00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:35.800\nthey work at.\n\n152\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.120\nAccount information like\ntheir logon name and\n\n153\n00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.790\na lot of important stuff\non this Account tab.\n\n154\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.320\nTheir logon name, their UPN suffix,\ntheir user principal name suffix,\n\n155\n00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.910\ntheir pre-Windows 2000,\nwhen you're domain/username.\n\n156\n00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.884\nRight, and then below that I've\ngot things like logon hours.\n\n157\n00:07:53.884 --> 00:07:57.680\nThis is where I could control\nwhen they're allowed to logon.\n\n158\n00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.083\nI might want to limit, Justin only works\nlet's say we're working with Daniel here.\n\n159\n00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:02.630\nDaniel works the day shift.\n\n160\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.903\nSo there really shouldn't be any reason\nthis account is ever logging in after,\n\n161\n00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.150\nsay 8 o'clock, even if he works later.\n\n162\n00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.570\nWe'll say 6.\nSo\n\n163\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.710\nusually what I'll do with this\noption is I'll deny everything, and\n\n164\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:19.750\nthen I'll say Daniel works Monday through\nFriday from 8 AM to 5 PM, we'll go to 6.\n\n165\n00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.210\nSomething like that.\n\n166\n00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:21.890\nI click OK.\n\n167\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:22.480\nOops.\n\n168\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.850\nI did that wrong.\n\n169\n00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.760\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n170\n00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.440\nI forgot to actually turn it on.\n\n171\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.470\nMonday through Friday from 8 to say,\n6, we'll say logon permitted, right?\n\n172\n00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.450\nSo what this is gonna do,\nif you're outside these hours,\n\n173\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.120\nthis account won't be allowed to log in.\n\n174\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.970\nNow click OK to apply those.\n\n175\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.414\nKeep in mind with that setting, though,\nit doesn't force them to log off.\n\n176\n00:08:43.414 --> 00:08:45.200\nLike, I set it at 6 o'clock.\n\n177\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.320\nIf Daniel's working late one day,\nhe can continue to work\n\n178\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.320\nall night long if he wants to,\nas long as he doesn't ever log off.\n\n179\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.790\nLet's say he logged in at 3 o'clock in the\nafternoon and he's working, he's working.\n\n180\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.080\n5 o'clock comes and goes, 6 o'clock\ncomes and goes, he's still working.\n\n181\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.218\nBut at 7 o'clock he's like wow,\nI need to go get a soda.\n\n182\n00:09:03.218 --> 00:09:05.080\nI'm getting ready to fall asleep.\n\n183\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.718\nSo he logs off and he goes down and\n\n184\n00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:09.928\nhe gets a drink, comes back,\ntries to log back in.\n\n185\n00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:11.970\nHe's not gonna be able to log back in.\n\n186\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.390\nAll right, so it doesn't force a log off,\nbut it will prevent a log back in.\n\n187\n00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay so Mike,\nI've got a quick question.\n\n188\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.580\nI just want to make sure I'm\nwrapping my head around this.\n\n189\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.700\nEven though it's not forcing a log off,\nwhat if some external resources that we're\n\n190\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.880\nmanaging permissions to, does that range\naffect the access to those resources?\n\n191\n00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.870\n&gt;&gt; No.\nJust the log on capabilities\n\n192\n00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.700\non that machine.\n\n193\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n194\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.170\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n195\n00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.060\nYou can also set log on 2.\n\n196\n00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.990\nA lot of organizations have\ncertain work stations, or\n\n197\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:48.670\nthey might do what they call hot desking,\nwhere there's six computers in this room.\n\n198\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.570\nYou go in, you use one of them.\n\n199\n00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.960\nYou log in to it, you get your work done,\nwhatever you gotta do.\n\n200\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.110\nBut you're only allowed to log in to\none of those six terminals there.\n\n201\n00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.280\nYou could actually set, okay,\nI'm only gonna allow this user to log into\n\n202\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.780\ncomputers one, or computer one, two,\nand three, or whatever the case may be.\n\n203\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.700\nAll right?\n\n204\n00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.210\nIt depends on your environment.\n\n205\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.480\nI don't see those options\nbeing used a whole lot, but\n\n206\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.910\nit is good to know they're there and\nthey're also possible test questions.\n\n207\n00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.990\nAnd you can see in some high-security\nenvironments where something like logon 2,\n\n208\n00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.300\nI want to make sure that I'm okay with\nMike sitting here at his laptop and\n\n209\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:23.880\nlogging in.\n\n210\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.640\nI don't want him walking\ninto the CEO's office and\n\n211\n00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.940\ntrying to login onto that machine.\n\n212\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.660\nIt might give him some level of\naccess that he shouldn't have.\n\n213\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.060\nI don't want him sitting in there.\n\n214\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:37.270\nSo you got log on hours, you got log on 2,\na few options down here.\n\n215\n00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.360\nWe'll talk more about these\nas we create the accounts.\n\n216\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.380\nAnd we don't need to go through\nevery one of these tabs.\n\n217\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.940\nOn the exam,\nthey're not going to be testing you on,\n\n218\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.720\nwhat's on the telephones tab or\nanything like that.\n\n219\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.080\nI just kinda wanna show you, and\nthen you should, in your lab machines,\n\n220\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.759\nkinda poke around and see what's in here.\n\n221\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.510\nNotice a lot of this\ninformation is blank and\n\n222\n00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.100\nthat's because I just created\nthese accounts for these demos.\n\n223\n00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.420\nThe more information you can fill in about\na user, the better off you are in the long\n\n224\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.840\nrun because you can use this\ninformation in other places.\n\n225\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.230\nI might set up dynamic access control.\n\n226\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.310\nOr we might be setting\nup federation services,\n\n227\n00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.460\nwhere I can give somebody access, or deny\nthem access or a certain level of access,\n\n228\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.830\nbased on their department, or\nbased on what their job title is.\n\n229\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:21.460\nI can search for\n\n230\n00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.550\nobjects in active directory based\non these kind of attributes.\n\n231\n00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.280\nIf all this isn't filled in,\nnone of it does me any good.\n\n232\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.160\nI won't be able to do any of that.\n\n233\n00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.132\nSo the more you can fill in, the better.\n\n234\n00:11:31.132 --> 00:11:32.830\nAll right?\n\n235\n00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.380\nThe member of tab is probably\nanother important one.\n\n236\n00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.150\nI do wanna point out, this is telling me\nwhat groups that user account belongs to.\n\n237\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.810\nWe haven't really talked about groups yet,\n\n238\n00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.430\nthat'll come up after we\nlearn about user accounts.\n\n239\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.960\nAnd we'll come back to this screen and\nlook a little closer at what this means.\n\n240\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.730\nAll right, so I'm gonna close that.\n\n241\n00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.300\nSo if I wanna create a new a user,\nand I'm in Active Directory Users and\n\n242\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.200\nComputers, it's easy\nenough to right-click,\n\n243\n00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.710\nright out here in the OU that I'm\nwanting to make the user account.\n\n244\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.886\nDo New, User.\n\n245\n00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:05.560\nI can right-click on the OU itself.\n\n246\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.510\nAnd choose New user.\n\n247\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.570\nOr I could use my little buttons up here,\nand I could click the little user icon.\n\n248\n00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:16.290\nAll three of those are gonna\nlaunch my new object-user wizard.\n\n249\n00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.390\nAnd we'll fill the information in.\n\n250\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.280\nWe'll put Justin.\n\n251\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.800\nYou know I might have put\nyou in another group.\n\n252\n00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.650\nMaybe that's why I didn't make you.\n\n253\n00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.270\nI'll do Justin, Dennis, is there one N?\n\n254\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Two Ns.\n&gt;&gt; Two Ns, is that right?\n\n255\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.040\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll say Justin.\n\n256\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.510\nSo what I'm doing, I'm giving him a first\nname, a last name, and a full name.\n\n257\n00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.900\nNow these are for display properties\nlike on your Start menu and\n\n258\n00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.860\nother places like that.\n\n259\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.210\nThey can Emails, they can display this.\n\n260\n00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.361\nThe log on name is\nactually right down here.\n\n261\n00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:48.361\nI've got it as UPN,\nis user principle name,\n\n262\n00:12:48.361 --> 00:12:50.710\nit needs to be unique\nthroughout the forest.\n\n263\n00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.190\nAnd I've got his pre-2 Windows 2000 name,\n\n264\n00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.350\nwhere it's domain backslash and\nthen his name.\n\n265\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.870\nWe'll click Next, and\nthen I'll supply a password.\n\n266\n00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.150\nWe do have to type that twice.\n\n267\n00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.170\nAnd then by default it says user\nmust change password at next logon.\n\n268\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.380\nNow that's normally what we want to do,\nright?\n\n269\n00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.850\nIf we've got five new hires coming in,\nI create their accounts,\n\n270\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.750\nI give them a generic password.\n\n271\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.380\nStill want to make it secure,\nyou don't want to use like, pass123.\n\n272\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.130\nIt would have to follow\nyour normal domain password\n\n273\n00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.860\nrules in the first place as far as\nlength and strength to create it.\n\n274\n00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.160\nAnd you don't want it so\n\n275\n00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.220\nweak that anybody can go, we got those new\nusers coming in, I'd better use pass123.\n\n276\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.230\nLet me see if I can try\nout one of those accounts.\n\n277\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.890\nBut once the user logs in that first time\nit's gonna prompt them to change it.\n\n278\n00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.400\nAnd now they'll create their\npassword that only they know.\n\n279\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.820\nI won't even know their password.\n\n280\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.460\nAnd that's usually the way we want it.\n\n281\n00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.940\nThere might be times when you\nassign passwords to people.\n\n282\n00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.600\nIn certain environments you\nsay this is your password,\n\n283\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.360\nI'll let you know when it changes.\n\n284\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.040\nIn that case you might uncheck this.\n\n285\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.000\nA user must change\npassword at next log on.\n\n286\n00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.810\nYou can also choose user\ncannot change password.\n\n287\n00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.220\nYou can't choose both because that\nreally wouldn't make sense, right?\n\n288\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.910\nUser must change password and\n\n289\n00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:10.410\nuser cannot change password,\nit's not gonna play along together, right?\n\n290\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.930\nUser can't change password is not\nsomething we see that often because\n\n291\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:16.480\nnormally we want them to change it.\n\n292\n00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.440\nFor security reasons,\nit's something that we don't know.\n\n293\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.480\nBut could be a service account\nthat we're creating and\n\n294\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.120\nI don't want anything trying to\nmanipulate that password or change it.\n\n295\n00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.850\nIt could be in a scenario like in an old\ninstructional company I worked with,\n\n296\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.930\nwe had a student account that all\nthe students that walked in the building,\n\n297\n00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.840\nthey logged onto their little\nwork stations as student.\n\n298\n00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.760\nAnd all was good, and then one day I was\nsitting there and students come in, and\n\n299\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.170\nthey're like, hey Mike I can't log in.\n\n300\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.550\nThe password is pa$$w0d.\n\n301\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.110\nYeah we know, we tried it,\nit's not working.\n\n302\n00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.640\nI'm like, come on,\nit's been the same password for\n\n303\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.068\nthree years,\nI don't know what's going on here.\n\n304\n00:14:57.068 --> 00:15:01.390\nCome to find out some student,\nprobably not maliciously,\n\n305\n00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.570\nmaybe testing things out,\ndecided to change his password.\n\n306\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:09.520\nHe was logged in as student, Ctrl-Alt-Del,\nchange your password, and changed it.\n\n307\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.450\nBut now nobody knew what the password was.\n\n308\n00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.660\nEasy enough to reset the password,\nthat wasn't the problem, but\n\n309\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.550\nwe didn't need that disrupting business\nas we're trying to operate these classes.\n\n310\n00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.810\nSo, for that particular account,\nuser cannot change password.\n\n311\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.120\nI see this used in libraries and\nplaces where there's public access.\n\n312\n00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.860\nYou don't want somebody trying to be\nmalicious and change a password so\n\n313\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.430\nthat nobody knows what it is.\n\n314\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.190\nPassword never expires,\nanother one that we rarely use.\n\n315\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.880\nService accounts maybe, and\n\n316\n00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.130\nthat was before we had\ngroup-managed service accounts.\n\n317\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.470\nBecause if I say password never expires,\nthat means you never have to change it,\n\n318\n00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.720\nand that gives the bad guy forever\nto try to figure out what it is.\n\n319\n00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.250\nThat's just never gonna be a good thing.\n\n320\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.040\nAccount is disabled,\npretty self-explanatory.\n\n321\n00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.690\nWhen I create this account,\nit's not gonna be enabled.\n\n322\n00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.015\nI'm gonna have to enable\nit before it can be used.\n\n323\n00:15:58.015 --> 00:15:59.099\nWe use this a lot.\n\n324\n00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:03.232\nWhen we create new users, if HR comes to\nme and says Hey look, I got ten new people\n\n325\n00:16:03.232 --> 00:16:07.580\ncoming in on Monday next week and\nwe're gonna need user accounts for them.\n\n326\n00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.900\nWell, I'm gonna create ten new accounts,\nand\n\n327\n00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.052\nI'm gonna set a generic password on there.\n\n328\n00:16:12.052 --> 00:16:15.592\nBut I don't want, all weekend,\nthose accounts to be active.\n\n329\n00:16:15.592 --> 00:16:19.677\nBecause, anybody that's been hired\nprobably remembers what that generic\n\n330\n00:16:19.677 --> 00:16:22.545\npassword was,\nif we don't change it that often, and\n\n331\n00:16:22.545 --> 00:16:25.182\nthey could potentially\ntry to use that account.\n\n332\n00:16:25.182 --> 00:16:27.441\nAnd what if we were hiring a manager,\nall right?\n\n333\n00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:30.150\nAnd they're like,\nthey're hiring a new guy Monday.\n\n334\n00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:35.205\nI know that his name is Bob Polson, so his\nuser log on name is going to be BPolson,\n\n335\n00:16:35.205 --> 00:16:38.385\nI wonder is Mike's still\nusing password 123.\n\n336\n00:16:38.385 --> 00:16:39.311\nLet me try.\n\n337\n00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:42.396\nAnd now they're logged on as this\nguy that has management rights, and\n\n338\n00:16:42.396 --> 00:16:43.940\nthat could be a bad day.\n\n339\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.915\nSo typically, we'll create the accounts,\ndisable them, and\n\n340\n00:16:46.915 --> 00:16:48.964\nthen as the people finally show up for\nwork.\n\n341\n00:16:48.964 --> 00:16:53.210\nIf they do, right, Monday morning\nonly five of the ten people show up.\n\n342\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.014\nThen we can uncheck that and\nwe can allow them to go to work.\n\n343\n00:16:57.014 --> 00:16:59.513\nAll right,\nI'll leave on the default there.\n\n344\n00:16:59.513 --> 00:17:01.850\nI'm gonna actually undo that,\njust in case we used this,\n\n345\n00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.622\nI don't wanna have to change the password.\n\n346\n00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:05.623\nI click Next and Fnish.\n\n347\n00:17:05.623 --> 00:17:09.622\nAnd that's it,\nwe now have a user account for Justin.\n\n348\n00:17:09.622 --> 00:17:14.391\nIf we go look at the Properties, the stuff\nthat i typed in is there and now I'd go\n\n349\n00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:19.262\nback and start filling in some of the\nother attributes to describe that object.\n\n350\n00:17:19.262 --> 00:17:22.223\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, maybe I missed something but\nsome of that other information\n\n351\n00:17:22.223 --> 00:17:25.384\nyou said is great to have like what is\nyour department, what is your title,\n\n352\n00:17:25.384 --> 00:17:26.052\nthose things.\n\n353\n00:17:26.052 --> 00:17:30.031\nDo I have to go in and after I've\ncreated user and back hill those things?\n\n354\n00:17:30.031 --> 00:17:30.733\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n355\n00:17:30.733 --> 00:17:31.924\nYou saw on the wizard,\n\n356\n00:17:31.924 --> 00:17:36.060\nthere really wasn't any part to fill\nin any of those other attributes.\n\n357\n00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.450\nThe attributes that you see in the wizard\nare just the required attributes\n\n358\n00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.420\nthat account.\n\n359\n00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.590\nAnd then once you create it,\nthat's when we have to go back in and\n\n360\n00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.432\nfill in all that other information.\n\n361\n00:17:45.432 --> 00:17:49.666\nThere are some other ways that we can\nstart to automate some of this and\n\n362\n00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:53.754\nPowerShell is another way that we\ncan start automating some of this\n\n363\n00:17:53.754 --> 00:17:56.172\nas well that we'll get to eventually.\n\n364\n00:17:56.172 --> 00:17:59.092\nAll right, so\nwe created a new user account there.\n\n365\n00:17:59.092 --> 00:18:02.435\nNow, this is the tool that I've used,\nthis is what I cut my\n\n366\n00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:06.624\nteeth on learning about Active Directory\nway back in Windows 2000.\n\n367\n00:18:06.624 --> 00:18:11.467\nBut starting in 2000 and,\ngosh, just in 2008 I think,\n\n368\n00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:13.902\nthey came up with a new console.\n\n369\n00:18:13.902 --> 00:18:15.020\nAnd let me open it up.\n\n370\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:21.041\nTools, Active Directory,\nAdministrative Center, all right?\n\n371\n00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:25.420\nMight have been 2012,\nI don't remember dates all that well.\n\n372\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.524\nBut it's not brand new, but it is a new\nway to deal with Active Directory\n\n373\n00:18:30.524 --> 00:18:34.366\ndatabase and\ndeal with objects within the database.\n\n374\n00:18:34.366 --> 00:18:38.543\nAll right, the big difference,\nit's gonna look a little different,\n\n375\n00:18:38.543 --> 00:18:40.990\nit's still managing the same database.\n\n376\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.312\nIt's ntds.dit, objects within\nthe database haven't changed.\n\n377\n00:18:45.312 --> 00:18:48.411\nUser objects, computer objects,\nOUs, containers.\n\n378\n00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:52.201\nNone of that's changed, it's just\nthe way we're interfacing with it.\n\n379\n00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:56.855\nThose older consoles, the snap ins,\nActive Directory users and\n\n380\n00:18:56.855 --> 00:19:01.171\ncomputers, for example,\nthey're using gosh its .NET and\n\n381\n00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:05.502\nsome other languages in\nthe background to make things work.\n\n382\n00:19:05.502 --> 00:19:08.921\nThis, the Administrative Center,\nis PowerShell based.\n\n383\n00:19:08.921 --> 00:19:13.552\nSo, everything I do in the GUI here, is\nactually being converted into a PowerShell\n\n384\n00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:17.110\ncommand in the background,\nand being executed, right?\n\n385\n00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.100\nEverything is going to\nPowerShell nowadays.\n\n386\n00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.370\nSo are their consoles.\n\n387\n00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.700\nAnd I actually think it's a cool thing.\n\n388\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.460\nI will tell you that I don't use\nthis that often because I'm so\n\n389\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.650\nused to doing it in the old console.\n\n390\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.630\nBut once you get used to\nthe administrative center,\n\n391\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.300\nit's really not bad.\n\n392\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.280\nIt looks a little different.\n\n393\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.520\nBut over here I've got my domain lab.\n\n394\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:43.216\nI can see all my containers,\nif we try to put this side by side with.\n\n395\n00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:45.380\nLet's see if we can get it to work here.\n\n396\n00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.143\nActive Director users and computers.\n\n397\n00:19:47.143 --> 00:19:49.804\nRight, you see it looks\na little different,\n\n398\n00:19:49.804 --> 00:19:54.297\nI don't see the entire tree over here\nlike I do in the old users of computers.\n\n399\n00:19:54.297 --> 00:19:59.181\nBut I can click on my domain,\nand I've got my different.\n\n400\n00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:00.683\nI can navigate into employees.\n\n401\n00:20:00.683 --> 00:20:02.460\nI can double-click on it.\n\n402\n00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.812\nIt's hard to see when I've got\nit collapsed like this, so\n\n403\n00:20:04.812 --> 00:20:05.822\nlet me bring it back out.\n\n404\n00:20:05.822 --> 00:20:09.597\nAs you click on things,\nif I go to lab Employees,\n\n405\n00:20:09.597 --> 00:20:12.923\nyou'll see these little fly-out menus.\n\n406\n00:20:12.923 --> 00:20:15.630\nAnd maybe I'll go into hosts,\nright, that's where we were.\n\n407\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.190\nAnd then you get to the point\nwhere there's nothing left, so\n\n408\n00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.580\njust double-click on that last entry,\nand now I'm looking at the hosts.\n\n409\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.798\nThis is what drives me a little bit crazy.\n\n410\n00:20:24.798 --> 00:20:28.760\nI'm old school, I like my file explorer\nto have my entire tree over there.\n\n411\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.843\nI like it expanded out to where I'm at.\n\n412\n00:20:30.843 --> 00:20:34.593\nCuz I can't tell I'm nested at\nthis point three-deep in OUs,\n\n413\n00:20:34.593 --> 00:20:37.941\nit's just showing me the one\nOU that I'm currently in.\n\n414\n00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:42.351\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, we're from different\ntechnological backgrounds but\n\n415\n00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:44.240\nI can actually concur.\n\n416\n00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.193\nIt's nice, it's pretty,\nI really like here, here, here.\n\n417\n00:20:49.193 --> 00:20:53.714\nSo I can follow my path essentially,\nmy trace of this is how I got here,\n\n418\n00:20:53.714 --> 00:20:58.389\ninstead of going, I remember this was\na list of users somewhere [LAUGH] but\n\n419\n00:20:58.389 --> 00:21:01.243\nI have to click a bunch\nof stuff to get there.\n\n420\n00:21:01.243 --> 00:21:05.766\nAnd yeah, it's kind of coming up and\ngoing as far as new UIs,\n\n421\n00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:08.533\nbut I tend to like the old UIs as well.\n\n422\n00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:09.202\n&gt;&gt; I'm with you, man.\n\n423\n00:21:09.202 --> 00:21:13.365\nThey day they drop Active Direct users\nof computers is gonna be a sad, sad day.\n\n424\n00:21:13.365 --> 00:21:17.867\nBut I'm sure that day is coming, because\neverything is going PowerShell, and\n\n425\n00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:21.510\nso we don't need two sets of tools\nto manipulate the same thing.\n\n426\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.113\nSo it will disappear eventually.\n\n427\n00:21:23.113 --> 00:21:29.812\nAnd it's got this whole recently used list\nlike you see the one I'm in now is Hosts.\n\n428\n00:21:29.812 --> 00:21:32.481\nI have been an external\n[INAUDIBLE] before in operations.\n\n429\n00:21:32.481 --> 00:21:39.463\nIf I go somewhere else,\nlike if I go into I don't know, users.\n\n430\n00:21:39.463 --> 00:21:42.570\nWhat's gonna happen is when you\nwatch this list for a second,\n\n431\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.292\neventually users gonna pop in because\nthat was a recently used location.\n\n432\n00:21:46.292 --> 00:21:47.186\nThere it goes.\n\n433\n00:21:47.186 --> 00:21:49.721\nAnd its gonna bump\nthe last one off my list.\n\n434\n00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:55.469\nSo this is kind of a recently used Just\nview over here and it didn't recognize me.\n\n435\n00:21:55.469 --> 00:21:58.527\nBut you can control like how many\nitems show up on your recently use and\n\n436\n00:21:58.527 --> 00:22:00.808\nthere's a lot of ways to\ncustomize the interface.\n\n437\n00:22:00.808 --> 00:22:04.358\nSo don't knock it don't don't\ndo what I do and say yeah,\n\n438\n00:22:04.358 --> 00:22:07.629\njust use it try it out you'll\nget to like it, alright.\n\n439\n00:22:07.629 --> 00:22:10.035\nBut anyway, we're not here to\nreally learn this console per se,\n\n440\n00:22:10.035 --> 00:22:11.497\nwe're here to work with user objects.\n\n441\n00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:14.743\nSo let's see if that part\nis any different, right?\n\n442\n00:22:14.743 --> 00:22:16.990\nI will go ahead and create a user.\n\n443\n00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.752\nNow, we got the tasks pane over here.\n\n444\n00:22:19.752 --> 00:22:22.641\nAnd I want you to be careful\nwith this tasks pane,\n\n445\n00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:25.752\nbecause you'll see there's\ntwo sets of commands.\n\n446\n00:22:25.752 --> 00:22:29.348\nThis one says Cherokee Boose, and\nI have got things like Reset password,\n\n447\n00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:30.511\nAdd to group, Delete.\n\n448\n00:22:30.511 --> 00:22:34.048\nThen I've got Host, New,\nDelete, Move, Properties and\n\n449\n00:22:34.048 --> 00:22:39.242\nwhat they're saying is the object you have\nselected is Cherokee, this user account.\n\n450\n00:22:39.242 --> 00:22:42.132\nSo here's things you can do\nwith that particular object.\n\n451\n00:22:42.132 --> 00:22:44.851\nThis object is located\nin an OU called host, so\n\n452\n00:22:44.851 --> 00:22:50.172\nif you're talking about the parent object,\nhere's things you can do with that, right?\n\n453\n00:22:50.172 --> 00:22:52.492\nIf I wanna make a new\nuser in the the host OU,\n\n454\n00:22:52.492 --> 00:22:55.280\nI don't need to commands\nthat deal with Cherokee.\n\n455\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.281\nI gotta use these down\nhere that deal with host.\n\n456\n00:22:57.281 --> 00:22:58.305\nSo just be careful.\n\n457\n00:22:58.305 --> 00:23:01.001\nI've seen people click the wrong delete,\nright?\n\n458\n00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:02.721\nI've got delete under Cherokee.\n\n459\n00:23:02.721 --> 00:23:04.592\nI've got delete under hosts.\n\n460\n00:23:04.592 --> 00:23:06.951\nWell, if I want to delete Cherokee, I can.\n\n461\n00:23:06.951 --> 00:23:08.267\nBut if I click this delete,\n\n462\n00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:11.081\nI delete the entire OU with all\nthe users that are in there.\n\n463\n00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:12.272\nNow it does give you warning.\n\n464\n00:23:12.272 --> 00:23:14.277\nI'm nt saying it's quite that easy, but\n\n465\n00:23:14.277 --> 00:23:17.383\nit's just something that could\nget you if you're not careful.\n\n466\n00:23:17.383 --> 00:23:20.783\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, is there any settings\nwhere I can kinda split those apart,\n\n467\n00:23:20.783 --> 00:23:21.498\ncuz I can see.\n\n468\n00:23:21.498 --> 00:23:24.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Me messing that up, be like delete,\n\n469\n00:23:24.024 --> 00:23:25.168\nyeah whatever.\n\n470\n00:23:25.168 --> 00:23:26.009\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n471\n00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:27.703\n&gt;&gt; Is there any way where I can\n\n472\n00:23:27.703 --> 00:23:30.483\nmove the OU portion to\nthe top of the panel?\n\n473\n00:23:30.483 --> 00:23:31.251\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n474\n00:23:31.251 --> 00:23:34.655\n&gt;&gt; You can collapse one up if you want,\nbut you gotta remember to do that\n\n475\n00:23:34.655 --> 00:23:38.213\nat every time\n&gt;&gt; It's just not real friendly in my\n\n476\n00:23:38.213 --> 00:23:39.140\nopinion.\n\n477\n00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.261\nIt's nice that it shows me\nall those commands out there.\n\n478\n00:23:41.261 --> 00:23:44.783\nI'm a right-clicker, just leave it on\nmy right-click menu and I'm good to go.\n\n479\n00:23:44.783 --> 00:23:48.170\nCuz I'm gonna right-click on something and\nthat's context sensitive.\n\n480\n00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.750\nThose commands work with that object,\nright?\n\n481\n00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.470\nOr I click out here and not on an object,\nso I'm dealing with the parent object.\n\n482\n00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:55.970\nIt just makes more sense to me.\n\n483\n00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.043\nIt's a little more intuitive.\n\n484\n00:23:57.043 --> 00:23:57.856\nBut, [SOUND].\n\n485\n00:23:57.856 --> 00:24:00.698\n&gt;&gt; Well, you definitely scared me,\ncuz I know I'd mess that up.\n\n486\n00:24:00.698 --> 00:24:03.494\nSo definitely be careful\nwhenever you have these.\n\n487\n00:24:03.494 --> 00:24:05.909\nThese kind of combin context on a menu.\n\n488\n00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:08.490\nI actually thought you had\nright clicked for a moment.\n\n489\n00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:11.240\nBut no, it's always there and\nkinda put together so.\n\n490\n00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is, you have to watch that.\n\n491\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.760\nAll right, so let's create a new user,\nI'll use their fancy task menu here.\n\n492\n00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.740\nI'm gonna click new user, and\n\n493\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.980\nyou'll see that the dialogue box looks a\nlot different when we go to create a user\n\n494\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.190\nin the Active Directory\nAdministrative Center, right.\n\n495\n00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.090\nBut in the end,\nit's all the same information.\n\n496\n00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:34.597\nIt's just all spread out,\nwhere as in Active Directory Users and\n\n497\n00:24:34.597 --> 00:24:38.693\nComputers I only saw the required fields,\nand I clicked new and created it.\n\n498\n00:24:38.693 --> 00:24:41.913\nHere I'm seeing everything, and\nthey're just showing me which\n\n499\n00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:45.319\nfields are required with their\nlittle asterisks there, all right.\n\n500\n00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:49.348\nSo we could get away with just\ntyping in test for the full name,\n\n501\n00:24:49.348 --> 00:24:52.150\ntest for the log on name, and clicking OK.\n\n502\n00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:55.990\nNow it wouldn't have a password so\nit would not be enabled,\n\n503\n00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.380\nwe wouldn't be able to use it just yet.\n\n504\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.640\nLet's go ahead and\nfill in a little more information.\n\n505\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.940\nFirst name, we'll call it Test,\nLast name, we'll call it User.\n\n506\n00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:10.770\nUPN log on, we'll call it test,\nwe'll set their Password.\n\n507\n00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:18.490\nAll right, all the other options\nthat we saw in the wizard.\n\n508\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.280\nUser must change password at next log on,\nor if I don't want that,\n\n509\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.970\nUser can't change password or\nPassword never expires, all right.\n\n510\n00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.080\nSo all the same options are there,\n\n511\n00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.020\nyou can scroll down through this screen\nto get to all the different sections.\n\n512\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.460\nYou can also use their little\nnavigation tree to jump\n\n513\n00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.950\nto a particular section\nover there if you want.\n\n514\n00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.830\nBut in the end,\nyou fill in the information, you click OK,\n\n515\n00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.550\nand you've got a new user sitting there,\nright.\n\n516\n00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.829\nAnd if I go back over to Active Directory,\nthe other console,\n\n517\n00:25:48.829 --> 00:25:52.425\nnow this doesn't refresh automatically,\nbut if I click refresh,\n\n518\n00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:54.980\nI want the hosts OU, I click Refresh.\n\n519\n00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.384\nThere's my test user, right.\n\n520\n00:25:56.384 --> 00:25:58.790\nSo you see that we're\nmanipulating the same database.\n\n521\n00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.517\nThere is no difference here\ndepending on which console you use,\n\n522\n00:26:03.517 --> 00:26:07.290\neverything really works the same way,\nall right.\n\n523\n00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:11.636\nSo lets do this, I had all these\nlab steps laid out, Justin,\n\n524\n00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:14.970\n[LAUGH] I don't think I\ndid a single one of them.\n\n525\n00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.240\nI made your account, and I made test,\nand let's go take a look.\n\n526\n00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.620\nActually, you know what, there is one more\nthing, I know we're getting short on time.\n\n527\n00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.010\nOne more thing I wanna show you\nbefore we run out of time here.\n\n528\n00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.327\nAnother cool thing about\nthe Administrative Center,\n\n529\n00:26:26.327 --> 00:26:28.098\nremember I said it's PowerShell based.\n\n530\n00:26:28.098 --> 00:26:32.222\nSo, when I went through that wizard and\nclicked OK to create that new user,\n\n531\n00:26:32.222 --> 00:26:36.155\nit actually executed a PowerShell\ncommand in the background.\n\n532\n00:26:36.155 --> 00:26:38.280\nWouldn't it be cool if we\ncould see that command?\n\n533\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:43.076\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would handy because,\nI'm sitting here thinking, man I'm lazy,\n\n534\n00:26:43.076 --> 00:26:45.940\nI would be trying to figure\nout how to automate some this.\n\n535\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.190\nAnd I you said that's possible,\nbut I don't know PowerShell.\n\n536\n00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.516\nSo, [SOUND] it'd be nice\nif it'd just give it to me.\n\n537\n00:26:52.516 --> 00:26:55.052\n&gt;&gt; All right, well let's see here,\nif we take a look at this console,\n\n538\n00:26:55.052 --> 00:26:56.743\nyou might wanna go full\nscreen on this just for\n\n539\n00:26:56.743 --> 00:26:59.080\na second cuz I'm gonna go way\ndown here in this bottom corner.\n\n540\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.470\nWe see this little chevron,\nsays Expand when I hover over it.\n\n541\n00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.880\nIt says WINDOWS POWERSHELL HISTORY.\n\n542\n00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.530\nIt's kind of hidden down there,\nyou wouldn't even notice at first but\n\n543\n00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.140\nwhen I click on that,aAnd I'm\ngonna drag this up a wee bit.\n\n544\n00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.525\nHere's the commands that\nwere actually executed.\n\n545\n00:27:13.525 --> 00:27:18.990\nNew-ADUser, -DisplayName Test User,\n-GivenName Test, all right.\n\n546\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.000\nAll the information that we\nfilled in in that wizard.\n\n547\n00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.450\nWhere I right clicked new user or\nselected new user was in that host OU.\n\n548\n00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.280\nSo it knows where to put the account.\n\n549\n00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.140\nSo even though we're in the GUI,\n\n550\n00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.200\nwe're actually running PowerShell commands\nwhen we use the new Administrative Center.\n\n551\n00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.815\nAnd then you'll see it ran a second\ncommand to set the account password,\n\n552\n00:27:38.815 --> 00:27:43.290\nthen it went back and ran another command\nto enable the account, all right.\n\n553\n00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.680\nThen it set the account control and\n\n554\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.580\nset the properties, for some of\nthe different properties that we set.\n\n555\n00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.150\nSo really, what four different commands?\n\n556\n00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.860\nOne, two three four, five different\ncommands that it ended up executing\n\n557\n00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.500\nin order to create that user account.\n\n558\n00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.210\nBut as Justin was saying,\nif I'm wanting to get used to PowerShell,\n\n559\n00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:02.660\nstart doing things.\n\n560\n00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.862\nMaybe I wanna start getting\ninto scripting and automation.\n\n561\n00:28:04.862 --> 00:28:07.670\nI've gotta learn my PowerShell,\nhere's a great way to do it right?\n\n562\n00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.660\nI can do something in the GUI, go delete\nan OU, I shouldn't say go delete and OU,\n\n563\n00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.740\ndo be careful with that.\n\n564\n00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.234\nBut go do your work in the new console,\nbut\n\n565\n00:28:15.234 --> 00:28:19.240\npay attention to what shows up\nin PowerShell history down here.\n\n566\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.436\nLook I can copy it, all right, I can\nselect this command, I can copy it out and\n\n567\n00:28:23.436 --> 00:28:27.710\nI can take it right over to PowerShell and\nI can paste it in there, right.\n\n568\n00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.100\nThat wouldn't work, I'd need to\ncreate some unique information here.\n\n569\n00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.266\nBut the point is it's really easy\nto start grabbing this stuff and\n\n570\n00:28:35.266 --> 00:28:38.611\nrunning over to PowerShell and\nimplementing that.\n\n571\n00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:41.990\nWhoops, didn't mean to open\nthat back up again, all right.\n\n572\n00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:48.370\nSo, that's a look at the GUIs and\nhow we can at least create objects.\n\n573\n00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:51.690\nI know we're out of time here, last thing\nI wanna show you, deleting objects.\n\n574\n00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:58.134\nRight click, Delete, it's going to warn\nyou, and that's it, it's gone, right.\n\n575\n00:28:58.134 --> 00:29:02.150\nThere are some big, big warnings I need\nto throw in with deleting user accounts.\n\n576\n00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.200\nBut that's gonna come when we\nstart talking about groups, so\n\n577\n00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.570\nI'll hold off on that.\n\n578\n00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.280\nHere's another test user we created,\ndifferent interface,\n\n579\n00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.810\nnow I'm in Users and Computers.\n\n580\n00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:16.010\nI click Delete, and it can't delete\nthe object, because I already deleted\n\n581\n00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.810\nit from the other console, and this\ndoesn't refresh, right, automatically.\n\n582\n00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:24.058\nSo if I click refresh I'll see that's gone\nand I could do Justin, we're gonna create\n\n583\n00:29:24.058 --> 00:29:27.834\nhim again later, so I'll go ahead and\ndelete him now, Yes and there you go.\n\n584\n00:29:27.834 --> 00:29:31.270\nSo deleting it, either consul,\nworks the same way.\n\n585\n00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:35.360\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, are we kind of\nfinished within the GUI space, or\n\n586\n00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.490\nare there still some other things,\nwe're definitely out of time.\n\n587\n00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.410\nBut are there some other things that\nwe need to come back in a part two, and\n\n588\n00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.320\nworry ourselves with.\n\n589\n00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.660\n&gt;&gt; Yep, there are,\nwe definitely got a little bit more to go,\n\n590\n00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.800\ncuz we wanna look at working\nwith multiple objects,\n\n591\n00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.120\nwe need to understand bulk\noperations in Active Directory.\n\n592\n00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.590\nAnd we also wanna take a look at a couple\nof tools that we can at least start to use\n\n593\n00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.620\nto automate this.\n\n594\n00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:01.520\nBecause user creation is one of those\njobs that's somebody gets stuck with,\n\n595\n00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.995\n[LAUGH] and it's kinda tedious, right.\n\n596\n00:30:03.995 --> 00:30:06.235\nSo if we can do anything to\nspeed that process up it's good.\n\n597\n00:30:06.235 --> 00:30:08.405\nAnd I got a few tricks I want to show you.\n\n598\n00:30:08.405 --> 00:30:12.545\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm' definitely excited for that,\nI tend to be a lazy individual by nature.\n\n599\n00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:15.780\nSo automating as much as possible\nis definitely at my wood house.\n\n600\n00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.750\nAnd well hopefully you'll come back as we\ncontinue looking at Active Directory Users\n\n601\n00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.580\nand Computers.\n\n602\n00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.780\nBut we are unfortunately out of time,\njoin us back for part two.\n\n603\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.340\nBut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison\n\n604\n00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.150\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

--> 00:00:10.938\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:14.734\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and welcome back\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:18.418\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and we're\ncontinuing on in Windows Server 2012.\n\n6\n00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:23.366\nIn particular, we're back with a part two\nin Active Directory users and computers.\n\n7\n00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:29.430\nAnd I know that Mike promised us some\nniceties in the previous episode.\n\n8\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.390\nSo hopefully he will deliver, and well in\nthe studio today, Mister Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.120\nHow are you doing today Mike?\n\n10\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.600\n&gt;&gt; Wow, pressure's on now right?\n\n11\n00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.446\nNiceties it is [LAUGH].\n\n12\n00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:38.628\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Justin thanks for\n\n13\n00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:41.230\nhaving me back and excited as always.\n\n14\n00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.790\nAnd yeah, we saw how we could\ncreate user accounts but\n\n15\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.146\nit was a very manual process, right?\n\n16\n00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.596\nIt was right click new user,\n\n17\n00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:50.679\nfill in all the information no\nmatter which console we used,\n\n18\n00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.436\nwe still had to fill out that information\nand we were doing it one at a time.\n\n19\n00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:57.300\nWhich occasionally,\nthat's not a bad way to do it.\n\n20\n00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.420\nBut if you have to do this often,\nyou might be looking for ways, maybe speed\n\n21\n00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.340\nthat up a little bit and that's what we\nare gonna take a look at in this episode.\n\n22\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.080\nThere's a couple different ways where we\ncan start being a little more efficient\n\n23\n00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.000\nwith creating these objects\nin Active Directory and\n\n24\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.620\nin particular, user accounts.\n\n25\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.740\nSo, the first one we are gonna look\nat Justin is a pretty simple one, and\n\n26\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.616\nthis one has been around for\na long time, they all have actually.\n\n27\n00:01:20.616 --> 00:01:23.698\nI'm gonna open up Active Directory,\nusers and\n\n28\n00:01:23.698 --> 00:01:27.100\ncomputers and\nI wanna make a new user in operations.\n\n29\n00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.050\nYou can see I've already got\na couple listed here and\n\n30\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.830\nwe've hired a new person\nthat we need to put in here.\n\n31\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.470\nNow, I could just click New User and\nfill the information in.\n\n32\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.280\nBut we wanna think about ways that we\ncan be a little bit more efficient.\n\n33\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.850\nAnd one of the things about user accounts\nis that users typically end up in groups.\n\n34\n00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.030\nGroups or membership lists that\nwe haven't talked about yet,\n\n35\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.650\nwe'll come back to that concept.\n\n36\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.100\nBut that's how we usually\nassign rights and permissions.\n\n37\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.262\nRight, if I have a sales users group and\nthat group is being given access to all\n\n38\n00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:02.600\nthe different resources that a normal\nsales person needs to do their job.\n\n39\n00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.840\nAnd so what I have to do is when I create\nthat account for that new sales person,\n\n40\n00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.680\nI have to put them in that group.\n\n41\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.590\nAnd a lot of times, we have to add\na user account to multiple groups.\n\n42\n00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.490\n10, 15 different groups and\nit's every time I have to\n\n43\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.620\ncreate a new sales user,\ngotta go through that process.\n\n44\n00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.410\nAll the sales people have the same\nmanager, they're all in the same\n\n45\n00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.360\ndepartment, they all have the same\nwork address a lot of times.\n\n46\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.250\nThere's a lot of information that's\nreally duplicated across those users.\n\n47\n00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.310\nThere's still some unique stuff like\ntheir first name and their last name,\n\n48\n00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.700\ntheir log on name,\ntheir password things like that.\n\n49\n00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.190\nBut there are some things\nthat are duplicated, and\n\n50\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.150\nthat's where we can start to\nbe a little more efficient.\n\n51\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.920\nWhat we're gonna do is create what\nMicrosoft is gonna call a template.\n\n52\n00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.500\nAnd then all we need to do is make\nsure all the attributes are filled out\n\n53\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.120\nproperly on that template.\n\n54\n00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.670\nThen when I need to create a new user,\nI can just copy the template.\n\n55\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.200\nAnd Windows Active Directory knows that\nsome of those things can't copy and\n\n56\n00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.400\nit'll make me fill those in.\n\n57\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.640\nBut the rest of the stuff, it'll allow\nme to copy over from that template.\n\n58\n00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.560\nAnd we can create as many templates as\nI need, I might have a sales user's\n\n59\n00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.210\ntemplate, a sales manager's template,\nan operation's template, whatever I need.\n\n60\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.184\nSo let's look at creating a template.\n\n61\n00:03:17.184 --> 00:03:21.660\nThey call template, I tell you it's\njust a user account, so all it is right?\n\n62\n00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.260\nSo we'll just gonna create a New User, and\n\n63\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.370\nI am gonna call this one\nmy Operations Template.\n\n64\n00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.865\nAnd you don't have to do that,\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n65\n00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:36.950\nI'm gonna give it a log\non name of apptemplate,\n\n66\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.805\ncuz I do have to give it a log\non name to create the account.\n\n67\n00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:43.120\nWe're not gonna log in using this account.\n\n68\n00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.640\nWe gonna click Next.\n\n69\n00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.030\nI'll assign a password.\n\n70\n00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.070\nAnd here you would definitely wanna\nuse a good long strong password,\n\n71\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.320\nbecause you're not using this account.\n\n72\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.297\nYou're probably not gonna\nchange this account.\n\n73\n00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:57.834\nIn fact, I'm gonna most likely\nchoose password never expires,\n\n74\n00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:01.450\nbecause I don't wanna worry about\nthe password expiring on this.\n\n75\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.090\nI'm gonna say user must\nchange password next logon\n\n76\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.460\nbecause that property is gonna\ncopy over to the new users.\n\n77\n00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.750\nBut I'm also going to\ndisable this account.\n\n78\n00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.660\nSo hopefully, again,\nthat's another security measure.\n\n79\n00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.260\nHave a good strong password, but\n\n80\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.175\nalso disable the account cuz I don't want\npeople using this template as an account.\n\n81\n00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:26.360\nAnd both of these properties will\ncopy over to the new user, all right?\n\n82\n00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.681\nWe'll click Next, and Finish, and\nI now have an operations template.\n\n83\n00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:32.320\nBut we're not gonna stop there.\n\n84\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.470\nLet's open that up and let's fill in\na few of these attributes, right?\n\n85\n00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:45.560\nFor an address, I don't know,\nlet's put 3925 Northwest, 60 seconds.\n\n86\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.980\nI'm making stuff up here, right?\n\n87\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.022\nWe'll say, Gainesville.\n\n88\n00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:50.718\nOops, well, let's make that look pretty.\n\n89\n00:04:50.718 --> 00:04:52.839\nGainesville, Florida.\n\n90\n00:04:53.956 --> 00:05:00.140\n32653, something like that, United States.\n\n91\n00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.510\nSomewhere in, there we go.\n\n92\n00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.500\nAccount information, again, this is unique\nstuff except for things like log on hours.\n\n93\n00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.580\nNow in my case,\nI probably don't wanna use log on hours.\n\n94\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.530\nBut let me just show you.\n\n95\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.890\nLet's find out if this is one of\nthose properties that copies over.\n\n96\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.540\nSo I'm gonna say, yeah, we'll go 8 eight\nto 5 again or something like that.\n\n97\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.830\nMonday through Friday, 8 to 6, 8 to 5,\nwhatever, I end up clicking on there.\n\n98\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.583\nRight, maybe we say log onto just\nthe following computers, client01.\n\n99\n00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:33.150\nAnd you can add as many as you want,\nright?\n\n100\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.490\nDown in that operations department I've\ngot two computers up at the front desk.\n\n101\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.320\nThey sit at client01 typing skills today,\nsearching for them.\n\n102\n00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.770\nAdd and we'll click OK.\n\n103\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.580\nSo we add a couple things there.\n\n104\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.380\nSo we can set profile information,\n\n105\n00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.110\norganization information their\ndepartment is Operations.\n\n106\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.710\nTheir title, maybe I don't have a title,\nlet me go get a manager.\n\n107\n00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.719\nWe'll put, I'll be their manager [LAUGH].\n\n108\n00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.891\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't know,\nthat might not be the best of choices.\n\n109\n00:06:05.891 --> 00:06:11.210\nBut I do wanna bring up something in,\nI think it's under stated a lot of times.\n\n110\n00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.941\nYou're using this user account that\nis disabled, it has a password on it.\n\n111\n00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:18.560\nAnd you're setting up these properties to\nbe copied over as part of the template.\n\n112\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.520\nHowever, you name the template Operations\ntemplate, you can name another things.\n\n113\n00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.750\nI would go further and say, I recommend\nstrongly you pick names such as that.\n\n114\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.708\nMainly because now, if your user list\ngrows, what's that template name?\n\n115\n00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:35.075\nDon't call it Napoleon or\nsomething like that.\n\n116\n00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:37.924\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I've actually had individuals go,\n\n117\n00:06:37.924 --> 00:06:39.916\ncan you help me with this?\n\n118\n00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:42.354\nAnd they picked this kind of a witty,\ntongue in-cheek names.\n\n119\n00:06:42.354 --> 00:06:43.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I'm like, no I won't help you,\n\n120\n00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:47.514\nuntil you make it to where I don't have\ncognitive load to figure out what's\n\n121\n00:06:47.514 --> 00:06:48.063\ngoing on.\n\n122\n00:06:48.063 --> 00:06:51.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, okay, you see it all\nthe time using like names of planets or\n\n123\n00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.800\nStar Wars characters.\n\n124\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.968\nAnd they don't really have a lot\nof meaning behind them, yeah.\n\n125\n00:06:54.968 --> 00:06:57.620\nSo it does make it tough.\n\n126\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.970\nLet's do member of, and I'm gonna add\nthese guys to a couple of groups.\n\n127\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.270\nWe'll check operations, and\n\n128\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.640\nI think there's a group called help desk,\nshould be good.\n\n129\n00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.252\nSo again, you might have more.\n\n130\n00:07:08.252 --> 00:07:13.200\nAnother thing along those same lines just\nand I tell you, you could go even further\n\n131\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.950\nand on that display name,\ndo an underscore out in front of it.\n\n132\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.650\nWhich is gonna help me\nin the sorting wise.\n\n133\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.420\nI can always [INAUDIBLE],\nI might have 100 of users in this view,\n\n134\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.210\nI can make those templates jump up to\nthe top, make them easier to find.\n\n135\n00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.020\nAll right, so we've filled in some\nproperties, let's put a phone number in\n\n136\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.150\nthere too, 555-1212, and\nwe will go ahead and click OK, right?\n\n137\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.680\nSo now I've got this template,\nnotice it is disabled.\n\n138\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.112\nRight, I couldn't use this\nto log on at this point, but\n\n139\n00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:46.230\nI can right click on it and choose Copy.\n\n140\n00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.000\nNow when I Copy it,\nit's smart enough to know, hey,\n\n141\n00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.250\nyou can't have the same user name and\nthings like that.\n\n142\n00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.969\nSo I know what you're trying to do.\n\n143\n00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:55.870\nYou're trying to make a new user,\n\n144\n00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.143\nnot an exact copy of operations template\ncuz that obviously wouldn't work.\n\n145\n00:08:00.143 --> 00:08:04.652\nSo now I can put in here,\nright, my user name.\n\n146\n00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:07.633\nI hope I spelled her name right.\n\n147\n00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:09.818\nAnd we'll click next.\n\n148\n00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:11.560\nWe'll assign a password.\n\n149\n00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.024\nNotice user must change password and\naccount is disabled is already selected,\n\n150\n00:08:15.024 --> 00:08:16.688\nbecause that came from the template.\n\n151\n00:08:16.688 --> 00:08:18.750\nWe'll click next and finish.\n\n152\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.786\nAnd now I have a new user account.\n\n153\n00:08:19.786 --> 00:08:21.222\nIt is disabled.\n\n154\n00:08:21.222 --> 00:08:22.324\nI open this up.\n\n155\n00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:24.602\nWe take a look at the address.\n\n156\n00:08:24.602 --> 00:08:25.882\nThere's all that information.\n\n157\n00:08:25.882 --> 00:08:27.763\nNotice what didn't get copied.\n\n158\n00:08:27.763 --> 00:08:29.619\nThis used to be a really\ngood test question.\n\n159\n00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:32.921\nI don't think they would get you\non that kind of thing anymore.\n\n160\n00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:34.848\nbut there are some\nattributes that don't copy.\n\n161\n00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:39.313\nStreet address does not,\nwhy I'm not exactly sure.\n\n162\n00:08:39.313 --> 00:08:40.407\nYou’d have to ask Microsoft on that.\n\n163\n00:08:40.407 --> 00:08:44.787\nBut street doesn't, but\ncity, state, zip do.\n\n164\n00:08:44.787 --> 00:08:46.780\nWhat else, member of.\n\n165\n00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.639\nThis is probably the most important thing\nat least in my experience using this.\n\n166\n00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:51.489\nIt's the Member of.\n\n167\n00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:54.775\nThis is what saves me the most work\nis that it's already in all of\n\n168\n00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:56.142\nthe appropriate groups.\n\n169\n00:08:56.142 --> 00:08:59.935\nI don't have to go back and remember what\ngroups do I have to put a new operations\n\n170\n00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:03.805\nperson in to make sure they have access to\nall the stuff they need to do their job.\n\n171\n00:09:03.805 --> 00:09:05.974\nIt's all done for me right?\n\n172\n00:09:05.974 --> 00:09:07.885\nIf we take a look at organization.\n\n173\n00:09:07.885 --> 00:09:10.685\nDepartments already filled in,\ncompany, manager.\n\n174\n00:09:10.685 --> 00:09:13.088\nAll that stuff is already there.\n\n175\n00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:16.240\nSo that's one way we can\nspeed up this process.\n\n176\n00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.621\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\nI do have a quick question for you.\n\n177\n00:09:17.621 --> 00:09:19.796\nI want to see, do those hours copy over?\n\n178\n00:09:19.796 --> 00:09:20.421\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n179\n00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:23.033\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I know you set\nthose to check it out.\n\n180\n00:09:23.033 --> 00:09:26.086\nWell, let's see if they actually\ncopied over cuz I don't know.\n\n181\n00:09:26.086 --> 00:09:28.402\nThat would save you a bunch of time,\n\n182\n00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:33.282\nbecause if you had to go individual\nusers and block out certain work hours.\n\n183\n00:09:33.282 --> 00:09:37.254\nYeah it might not take much to remember,\nbut I can see that interface taking\n\n184\n00:09:37.254 --> 00:09:40.863\na whole bunch of time to do that for\nany substantial amount of users.\n\n185\n00:09:40.863 --> 00:09:44.557\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and I tell you what Jess,\nand I'll throw you cuz I know you like\n\n186\n00:09:44.557 --> 00:09:47.550\nto say we wanna find more\nefficient ways to do things right?\n\n187\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.052\nMaking a template itself,\nthere's actually shortcut to that too.\n\n188\n00:09:53.052 --> 00:09:57.069\nSo I made a template, and\nI had to create operations template, and\n\n189\n00:09:57.069 --> 00:10:01.731\nI had to add it to all the appropriate\ngroup, and fill in all the information,\n\n190\n00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:04.740\nand once I did that everything was good.\n\n191\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.723\nBut making it,\nI had to go through that process.\n\n192\n00:10:06.723 --> 00:10:10.910\nNot much I know, but\ncould we save even one more step?\n\n193\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.625\nAbsolutely, what if you already some users\nthat you created before you started doing\n\n194\n00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:16.812\ntemplates, right?\n\n195\n00:10:16.812 --> 00:10:20.830\nAnd now you're getting wiser and\nyou wanna start using templates.\n\n196\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:25.829\nWell, grab one of your users\nthat already exists in all\n\n197\n00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:31.925\nthe appropriate groups, copy that and\ncreate your new template.\n\n198\n00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:34.725\nI'll just really quickly whip\nthrough this just so we can,\n\n199\n00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:38.660\nlet's see if it'll let me do, that's not\ngoing to be a strong password though.\n\n200\n00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:43.242\nYeah it didn't.\n\n201\n00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.436\nI'm trying to go fast,\n\n202\n00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:47.500\nand I actually would have been\nfaster just to type password.\n\n203\n00:10:52.607 --> 00:10:57.175\nAll right so I copied Julio an existing\naccount to create my new template,\n\n204\n00:10:57.175 --> 00:11:00.271\nwhich is already in all\nthe appropriate groups and\n\n205\n00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:03.460\nhas all the other information\nalready filled out.\n\n206\n00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.100\nSo just a little shortcut if you're going\nto start using templates how do I get\n\n207\n00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.610\nstarted?\n\n208\n00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.803\nCopy some of your existing users,\nand then go back and\n\n209\n00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:11.570\ndouble check all of your properties.\n\n210\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.130\n&gt;&gt; Well Mike, this is definitely\npleasing to my more lazy side, but\n\n211\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.215\nI'm gonna put a challenge out there.\n\n212\n00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:20.377\nThis isn't good enough for\nme, as far as how lazy I am.\n\n213\n00:11:20.377 --> 00:11:25.350\nAre there other ways that maybe I\ncould expedite a bulk list of these?\n\n214\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.607\nIf I have a dump from an old\ndatabase ,or an old system, or,\n\n215\n00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:32.715\nmaybe I figured out some programmatic\nway to organize this information and\n\n216\n00:11:32.715 --> 00:11:35.735\nit's aggregated, but now,\nI need to put it in there.\n\n217\n00:11:35.735 --> 00:11:36.527\nIs there a way to do that?\n\n218\n00:11:36.527 --> 00:11:40.784\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes there is.\n\n219\n00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.461\n[LAUGH] We can definitely do that.\n\n220\n00:11:42.461 --> 00:11:48.230\nNow we're gonna start talking\nabout tools like CSVDE and LDIFDE.\n\n221\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.352\nCrazy names, but really cool little\ntools that have, again, been around for\n\n222\n00:11:52.352 --> 00:11:53.047\na long time.\n\n223\n00:11:53.047 --> 00:11:54.505\nBecause as Justin pointed out,\n\n224\n00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:57.644\nwhat we're doing here is we are trying\nto be a little more efficient.\n\n225\n00:11:57.644 --> 00:12:01.085\nIt also helps us from keeping making\nmistakes because they're in the right\n\n226\n00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:04.980\ngroups already, right, because I set the\ntemplate up properly in the first place.\n\n227\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.023\nSo that definitely helps, but as you see,\nit's still a one at a time type thing.\n\n228\n00:12:09.023 --> 00:12:13.550\nSo let's try to take it up\nto the next step, all right?\n\n229\n00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.823\nNow let's take a look,\nI'm gonna open up the Command Prompt.\n\n230\n00:12:15.823 --> 00:12:20.086\nI'm gonna actually open that up\nas an administrator, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:20.086 --> 00:12:25.030\nAnd the first rule I wanna talk\nabout is csvde, all right?\n\n232\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.826\nAnd let's just do a switch-question mark,\n\n233\n00:12:26.826 --> 00:12:29.148\nlike we always do with our tools\nwhen we first look at them.\n\n234\n00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:32.900\nThis is how you're gonna get all\nyour help associated with it.\n\n235\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.599\nAnd it gives you your parameters,\nyour syntax how to properly use this tool.\n\n236\n00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:42.394\nCSVDE is a CSV comma\nseparated values right?\n\n237\n00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:43.674\nHopefully you're familiar with this.\n\n238\n00:12:43.674 --> 00:12:49.890\nIt's a text format where we have values\nin a one line separated by commas.\n\n239\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.139\nAnd then the next line is a separate\nobject, values separated by values.\n\n240\n00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:56.526\nJust a comma separated line.\n\n241\n00:12:56.526 --> 00:13:00.107\nAnd then the very first line in\nthe file defines the attributes.\n\n242\n00:13:00.107 --> 00:13:01.868\nI know its hard to grasp sometimes.\n\n243\n00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:03.215\nI'll show you one in a second.\n\n244\n00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.958\nIn fact, let's look at one now.\n\n245\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:09.227\nI've got one already built up here\nthat we'll use in a little bit.\n\n246\n00:13:09.227 --> 00:13:12.862\nAnd let's bump this font up so\nwe can all see it a little better.\n\n247\n00:13:12.862 --> 00:13:16.579\n[BLANK AUDIO].\n\n248\n00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:19.519\nSo this is a classical csv-file.\n\n249\n00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:24.261\nWhat you'll see is the first line defines\nthe attributes that are going to be\n\n250\n00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:29.050\npresent in the order that they are gonna\nappear on the following lines.\n\n251\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.347\nSo I can see distinguished name\nComma objectClass surname,\n\n252\n00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:37.231\ngivenName, samAccountName,\nuserPrincipalName.\n\n253\n00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:39.389\nSo that's my definition.\n\n254\n00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:41.625\nAnd then the next line is an object.\n\n255\n00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:46.370\nNow this is an OU, so it has\na distinguish name, and it's got a class,\n\n256\n00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.874\nobject class organizational unit.\n\n257\n00:13:48.874 --> 00:13:53.200\nBut it doesnt' have a surname, a first\nname, a last name, I used PrincipalName.\n\n258\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.676\nSo notice, they're just blanks.\n\n259\n00:13:54.676 --> 00:13:56.006\nBut there are commas,\n\n260\n00:13:56.006 --> 00:14:01.242\nvery important when you're dealing with\nCSVs that everything is accounted for.\n\n261\n00:14:01.242 --> 00:14:04.291\nAll of these attributes up here,\nthey can be blank depending on\n\n262\n00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:07.237\nwhat you're importing right,\nthat might cause a problem.\n\n263\n00:14:07.237 --> 00:14:10.708\nIf you're importing a user and you don't\nhave a UPN, that's gonna cause a problem.\n\n264\n00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:13.960\nBut as far as the CSV goes,\neverything has to be accounted for.\n\n265\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.201\nSo a comma, even if there's a blank,\n\n266\n00:14:16.201 --> 00:14:20.903\nwe're gonna represent that with just a\nspace and a comma or no space and a comma.\n\n267\n00:14:20.903 --> 00:14:22.500\nBelow that is an actual user.\n\n268\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.205\nI've got distinguish name comes first and\nthen object class user.\n\n269\n00:14:27.205 --> 00:14:32.450\nAnd then SN, surname,\nMagary given name, Rob.\n\n270\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.913\nSam account name, Rob.\n\n271\n00:14:33.913 --> 00:14:37.456\nUser principal name, rob@lab.itpro.tv.\n\n272\n00:14:37.456 --> 00:14:41.060\nAnd then the next line\nis a separate object.\n\n273\n00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.995\nSo each object is on its own line.\n\n274\n00:14:42.995 --> 00:14:47.960\nAttributes are on that row or\nthat line separated by commas.\n\n275\n00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.876\nNow you can use any text editor\nfrom note pads like I've got here.\n\n276\n00:14:51.876 --> 00:14:55.514\nYou can also use a spread sheet\nprogram like Excel or Open Office or\n\n277\n00:14:55.514 --> 00:14:56.780\nsomething like that.\n\n278\n00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.853\nMost of those can create CSVs.\n\n279\n00:14:58.853 --> 00:15:02.284\nAnd they're actually a little bit easier\nto work with because you've got columns\n\n280\n00:15:02.284 --> 00:15:03.350\nand rows, right?\n\n281\n00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.512\nYou're all familiar with\nworking with a spreadsheet.\n\n282\n00:15:05.512 --> 00:15:10.167\nAnd you can think about this one being\nyour header row at the top of that\n\n283\n00:15:10.167 --> 00:15:13.376\nspreadsheet, each column, row A, right, or\n\n284\n00:15:13.376 --> 00:15:17.930\none, is those will be the headers for\nthose columns, right?\n\n285\n00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.091\nSo you can use Excel,\nyou can save it as a CSV file.\n\n286\n00:15:22.091 --> 00:15:23.814\nIt's one of your save options with Excel.\n\n287\n00:15:23.814 --> 00:15:26.269\n&gt;&gt; And there is nothing special about CSV.\n\n288\n00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:30.322\nIt's actually a common data exchange\nformat, because there's no encoding,\n\n289\n00:15:30.322 --> 00:15:31.700\nthere's no styling.\n\n290\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.711\nIt is value, comma, value, comma,\nwith a very particular structure.\n\n291\n00:15:35.711 --> 00:15:38.407\nSo if you use one of those Excel programs,\n\n292\n00:15:38.407 --> 00:15:43.190\nIt'll make sure you have a column header,\nand then each row is a record.\n\n293\n00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.113\nAnd if you're from a database community,\nyou're like,\n\n294\n00:15:45.113 --> 00:15:46.140\nthat kinda looks like a table.\n\n295\n00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.155\nWell yeah, that's kinda what it is.\n\n296\n00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:52.185\nSo it's probably easier if you have\nsomething large, not like this one,\n\n297\n00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.689\nto put it in a spreadsheet.\n\n298\n00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:56.058\nBut here,\nyou can kind of just map through this.\n\n299\n00:15:56.058 --> 00:15:57.298\nSo do keep that in mind,\n\n300\n00:15:57.298 --> 00:16:01.155\nif you have to sift through You may not\nwanna read it as regular text per se.\n\n301\n00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:04.627\n&gt;&gt; No, it'd definitely be easier to\nlook at this in some type of spreadsheet\n\n302\n00:16:04.627 --> 00:16:06.540\napplication, absolutely.\n\n303\n00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.584\nAll right, so we're gonna close that up.\n\n304\n00:16:07.584 --> 00:16:08.817\nI'm gonna close out of there for\njust a second.\n\n305\n00:16:08.817 --> 00:16:11.537\nNow let's talk a little\nbit more about CSDVE.\n\n306\n00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:14.250\nSo it can do import and export.\n\n307\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.215\nWe can export objects\nout of ActiveDirectory,\n\n308\n00:16:18.215 --> 00:16:22.087\nwe can import objects\ninto ActiveDirectory.\n\n309\n00:16:22.087 --> 00:16:23.847\nWe can create new objects when we import.\n\n310\n00:16:23.847 --> 00:16:25.479\nWe can be creating new objects.\n\n311\n00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:29.448\nWe cannot modify existing objects or\ndelete existing objects.\n\n312\n00:16:29.448 --> 00:16:33.680\nSo CSV DE is a little\nlimited in that fact.\n\n313\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.865\nIt's also, go ahead.\n\n314\n00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:37.923\n&gt;&gt; Now I forsee an issue there.\n\n315\n00:16:37.923 --> 00:16:41.310\nWe just talked about looking through this,\nkind of figuring out things.\n\n316\n00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.050\nSo what you're telling me is if I can't\nmodify or delete, are we going to run into\n\n317\n00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.188\nproblems if the records already exist and\nwe're trying to import?\n\n318\n00:16:48.188 --> 00:16:52.370\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and there's a way we\ncan get around that sort of kind of.\n\n319\n00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.851\nIt will throw an error because it\ncannot modify existing objects, and\n\n320\n00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:57.214\nit can't remove objects.\n\n321\n00:16:57.214 --> 00:17:01.168\nIf I try to create something that's gonna\nduplicate a username already exists or\n\n322\n00:17:01.168 --> 00:17:05.600\nthat you already exist or something\nlike that, it will throw an error.\n\n323\n00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.869\nThere's a way we can\nskip by that with a -k.\n\n324\n00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:12.284\nLet's go through some of these parameters.\n\n325\n00:17:12.284 --> 00:17:15.697\nSo CSVDE, by default, does an export.\n\n326\n00:17:15.697 --> 00:17:19.255\nSo its default mode is export.\n\n327\n00:17:19.255 --> 00:17:22.163\nAnd we'll do an example here in just\na second once we get through these\n\n328\n00:17:22.163 --> 00:17:22.774\nparameters.\n\n329\n00:17:22.774 --> 00:17:25.098\nIf I wanna import, I have to switch it.\n\n330\n00:17:25.098 --> 00:17:28.960\nI have to add a -i to change its\nmode to import, instead of export.\n\n331\n00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.624\nWhether I'm importing or I'm exporting,\ntypically I'll need a filename, right?\n\n332\n00:17:32.624 --> 00:17:35.083\nIf I'm gonna export,\nwhere am I gonna export to?\n\n333\n00:17:35.083 --> 00:17:36.923\nIf I'm importing,\nwhat am I importing from?\n\n334\n00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:40.790\nSo there's my -f,\nanother common switch to use.\n\n335\n00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.005\nThose are probably the biggest ones for\nimporting.\n\n336\n00:17:44.005 --> 00:17:46.795\nCuz if I'm importing, I just need to it,\nhey, you're importing and\n\n337\n00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:48.658\nthis is the file that\nyou're importing from.\n\n338\n00:17:48.658 --> 00:17:52.890\nAll right below that,\nwe've got some export specific ones.\n\n339\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.656\nThese definitely come in handy.\n\n340\n00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:57.910\nBut dash D is your root distinguish name.\n\n341\n00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.985\nI typically don't want to export\nout the entire active directory.\n\n342\n00:18:00.985 --> 00:18:03.196\nThere's a lot of objects in there.\n\n343\n00:18:03.196 --> 00:18:07.005\nSo I usually want to be a little more\nspecific about where I'm starting\n\n344\n00:18:07.005 --> 00:18:07.920\nmy export from.\n\n345\n00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.992\nSo we'll tell it the distinguish name.\n\n346\n00:18:08.992 --> 00:18:11.950\nMaybe you have a particular\nOU that you're interested in.\n\n347\n00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.890\nFilter allows me to do just that.\n\n348\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.738\nIn that OU,\nI might have hundreds of users.\n\n349\n00:18:17.738 --> 00:18:21.390\nAnd I just want the users who\nhave a department of sales.\n\n350\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.040\nOr I just need the objects that are users,\nnot the groups and\n\n351\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.310\nnot any computers that\nmight be in that OU.\n\n352\n00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.333\nSo -r allows me to filter.\n\n353\n00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:33.930\nSearch scope lets me search just\nthat OU or just that container.\n\n354\n00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.799\nOr do I want to nested\ncontainers just one level down?\n\n355\n00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:38.761\nOr the entire sub-tree?\n\n356\n00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:41.587\nAnd then dash-l is what attributes.\n\n357\n00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:45.880\nWhen we look at a user account, there's\nhundreds of attributes to describe a user.\n\n358\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.081\nWe typically do not want all of those.\n\n359\n00:18:48.081 --> 00:18:51.690\nSo -l allows me to list\njust the attributes I want.\n\n360\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.080\nOr if you want most of them, you can do\na -o and then omit certain attributes.\n\n361\n00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.200\nAnd then give me the rest of them.\n\n362\n00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.885\nThose are probably the most commonly\nused parameters with this command.\n\n363\n00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:07.520\nAnd then the -k helps me get around\nwhat Justin was talking about, -cases.\n\n364\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.193\nIgnore errors and continue on.\n\n365\n00:19:10.193 --> 00:19:13.590\nAnd you might think, well,\nwhy would I ever wanna ignore an error?\n\n366\n00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.764\nWell, sometimes if I've got a list\nof 100 users I'm trying to import.\n\n367\n00:19:18.764 --> 00:19:22.614\nIf the second one in there has a typo,\na missing value or\n\n368\n00:19:22.614 --> 00:19:26.770\nit's a duplication of something,\nit's gonna fail.\n\n369\n00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.773\nAnd then the entire process stops.\n\n370\n00:19:28.773 --> 00:19:32.152\nWhereas if I do a -k,\nit'll fail on that one, but\n\n371\n00:19:32.152 --> 00:19:35.387\nit'll still do the 97, 98 user accounts.\n\n372\n00:19:35.387 --> 00:19:38.780\nAnd then I can go back and troubleshoot\nthe one that didn't work, right?\n\n373\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.375\nSo that's what that -k is for.\n\n374\n00:19:41.375 --> 00:19:44.530\nAll right, so let's take a look\nat how we can do some of this.\n\n375\n00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.937\nWe are gonna start with doing an export.\n\n376\n00:19:46.937 --> 00:19:50.890\nSo CSV DE is gonna be\nthe start of my command.\n\n377\n00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:55.889\nRemember export's the default mode,\nso I just need to\n\n378\n00:19:55.889 --> 00:20:01.115\ntell it where I wanna put this,\nand I'm gonna do a c:\\.\n\n379\n00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:03.753\nWhat I did I make that folder,\nldif I think yeah.\n\n380\n00:20:03.753 --> 00:20:08.950\nAnd we'll call it export,\nlet's export that host.\n\n381\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.590\nI've got a bunch of users in that host.\n\n382\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.700\nAnd the file format is gonna be ldf.\n\n383\n00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:19.255\nSo I'm calling it where I wanna export\nthis information, and then I wanna limit,\n\n384\n00:20:19.255 --> 00:20:23.870\nI don't want everything, so I 'm gonna do\na -d and give it the distinguished name of\n\n385\n00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.740\nthe OU that I want the export\nthe user accounts from.\n\n386\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:33.810\nSo my OU is called hosts, which is\nnested inside an OU called employees.\n\n387\n00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.514\nI can't talk and type at the same time,\nwhich is in my do, root of my domain.\n\n388\n00:20:38.514 --> 00:20:45.014\nAnd my domain components\nbreak down into lab.\n\n389\n00:20:45.014 --> 00:20:48.640\nDomain component equals IT pro.\n\n390\n00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.377\nAnd domain component equals TV.\n\n391\n00:20:51.377 --> 00:20:52.780\nAnd then I'll end my quote.\n\n392\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.165\nYou don't technically need the quotes\nunless you got a space in one of those,\n\n393\n00:20:56.165 --> 00:20:57.372\nbut I find it always helps.\n\n394\n00:20:57.372 --> 00:21:00.240\nAnd hopefully you're familiar with\ndistinguish names at this point.\n\n395\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.583\nRemember, distinguish name is the path\nto the object in the database.\n\n396\n00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:09.783\nIn this case, I'm looking for\nobjects that are inside the host OU,\n\n397\n00:21:09.783 --> 00:21:15.033\nwhich is nested inside the employee's OU,\nwhich is at the root of lab.itpro.tv.\n\n398\n00:21:15.033 --> 00:21:17.131\nIf you look over here behind me or\n\n399\n00:21:17.131 --> 00:21:21.719\nbehind this screen you can kinda see\nhere's the host OU which is nested\n\n400\n00:21:21.719 --> 00:21:26.040\ninside the employees OU which\nis nested inside lab.itpro.tv.\n\n401\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.256\nSo, I've got my path.\n\n402\n00:21:28.256 --> 00:21:34.216\nAnd then my lab.itpro.tv, each part of my\ndomain name becomes a domain component.\n\n403\n00:21:34.216 --> 00:21:39.099\nSo if I had east.training.lab.itpro.tv,\nI've have to do each one.\n\n404\n00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.804\nDC east, DC training, DC lab, and\n\n405\n00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:47.160\nall of the way out, all right, uh-huh.\n\n406\n00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.468\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike,\nI got a real quick question for you.\n\n407\n00:21:48.468 --> 00:21:50.497\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And then, admittedly so,\n\n408\n00:21:50.497 --> 00:21:51.919\nI'm not a Windows guy.\n\n409\n00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:56.854\nBut since we're using CSVDE to export,\nis the ldf-\n\n410\n00:21:56.854 --> 00:21:57.375\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:21:57.375 --> 00:21:58.870\n&gt;&gt; Extension, is that what we need,\n\n412\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.891\ncuz that might cause some confusion,\nright?\n\n413\n00:22:00.891 --> 00:22:04.795\n&gt;&gt; That is great point Justin,\nI'm glad you noticed that.\n\n414\n00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:09.856\n&gt;&gt; I had moved on to ldif before\nwe even finished good old CSVDE.\n\n415\n00:22:09.856 --> 00:22:11.410\nSo let's switch that up a little bit.\n\n416\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.063\nI have another folder for\nCSV files [LAUGH] and\n\n417\n00:22:15.063 --> 00:22:18.724\nwe'll call this one again, export hosts.\n\n418\n00:22:18.724 --> 00:22:21.700\nAnd let's call it a .CSV, how's that?\n\n419\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.618\nLittle bit better?\n\n420\n00:22:22.618 --> 00:22:24.190\nAll right, so now we're yeah.\n\n421\n00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.188\nThat was good catch man, I would have\nbeen going that was a silly mistake.\n\n422\n00:22:28.188 --> 00:22:29.230\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n423\n00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.468\nWe got my path of the file that\nI wanna export this out to.\n\n424\n00:22:32.468 --> 00:22:38.100\nI told it where I wanna look in the\ndirectory for the objects I wanna export.\n\n425\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.974\nI also wanna limit what\nI'm going to export.\n\n426\n00:22:41.974 --> 00:22:45.206\nI'm gonna do a -l to list\nthe attributes that I want.\n\n427\n00:22:45.206 --> 00:22:51.018\nAnd I want to distinguish name, object\nclass, and none of this is case sensitive.\n\n428\n00:22:51.018 --> 00:22:55.246\nI do the case just for readability.\n\n429\n00:22:55.246 --> 00:22:58.316\nGiven name, we’ve got surname in there.\n\n430\n00:22:58.316 --> 00:22:59.650\nWe’ve got given name.\n\n431\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.978\nLet’s do Sam, account name, and\n\n432\n00:23:03.978 --> 00:23:09.361\nlet’s also get that userPrincipal name.\n\n433\n00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:16.490\nAll right, so there's my list of\nattributes that I wanna export.\n\n434\n00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.478\nWe'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n435\n00:23:18.478 --> 00:23:22.040\nAnd what we see connecting\nto log in as current user.\n\n436\n00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.476\nI ran this as admin.\n\n437\n00:23:23.476 --> 00:23:25.590\nExporting to directory that I gave it.\n\n438\n00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.576\nWriting out entries.\n\n439\n00:23:26.576 --> 00:23:28.450\nSeven entries exported.\n\n440\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.015\nCommand completed successfully.\n\n441\n00:23:30.015 --> 00:23:31.700\nSo let's see what we got.\n\n442\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.852\nLet's switch over to that folder.\n\n443\n00:23:32.852 --> 00:23:35.553\nAnd I won't have to use\nthe path the whole time here.\n\n444\n00:23:35.553 --> 00:23:37.736\nWe'll do a little CSV.\n\n445\n00:23:37.736 --> 00:23:39.187\nSee what we got in there.\n\n446\n00:23:39.187 --> 00:23:41.447\nAnd there's my export hosts.\n\n447\n00:23:41.447 --> 00:23:44.800\nSo there's a low pad with export hosts.\n\n448\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.365\nAnd there we go.\n\n449\n00:23:47.365 --> 00:23:50.216\nLooks just like my other file,\nvery similar.\n\n450\n00:23:50.216 --> 00:23:55.306\nWhere I've got my attributes right\nacross the top separated by commas,\n\n451\n00:23:55.306 --> 00:23:59.895\nand then I've got all of my objects\nwith their distinguish name,\n\n452\n00:23:59.895 --> 00:24:04.829\ntheir class, their Surname,\ngiven name, all the way down through.\n\n453\n00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:09.231\nSo you might export objects out of\nActive Directory to have a record of it,\n\n454\n00:24:09.231 --> 00:24:13.278\nmaybe to use with some other application,\nlike Justin was saying,\n\n455\n00:24:13.278 --> 00:24:17.694\nCSV file is a very common format that\nmost applications will understand.\n\n456\n00:24:17.694 --> 00:24:20.702\nSo I can turn around,\nif I've got dissimilar systems,\n\n457\n00:24:20.702 --> 00:24:22.840\nI can export that data out of database.\n\n458\n00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.810\nGive them a CSV file,\nthey can now import it, write reports,\n\n459\n00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.150\nor do whatever it is they need\nto do with that information.\n\n460\n00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.945\nBut we really started this conversation\nwanting to create new objects.\n\n461\n00:24:34.945 --> 00:24:36.837\nSo let's see how we can do that.\n\n462\n00:24:36.837 --> 00:24:39.225\nIn that same location that we\nalready looked at this, but\n\n463\n00:24:39.225 --> 00:24:40.580\nlet's look at it one more time.\n\n464\n00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.681\nWe'll do notepad importDev.csv,\nand so what I've got is I have\n\n465\n00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:50.689\nmy attributes across the top,\nand then I've got my objects that\n\n466\n00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:55.810\nI want to create, one on each line,\nvalues separated by commas.\n\n467\n00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:01.890\nSo that's gonna be my input file for my\nimport process, and, oops, you know what?\n\n468\n00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.130\nLet's look at that one more time.\n\n469\n00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.360\nI'm putting them in the Developer's OU.\n\n470\n00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.800\nI've changed the path up a little bit.\n\n471\n00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.530\nSo I've got that employee, oops.\n\n472\n00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.030\nGot that Employees OU.\n\n473\n00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:18.230\nInside the Employees OU\nis my Developers OU.\n\n474\n00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.480\nSo and we're gonna see what Justin was\nasking about earlier right here in\n\n475\n00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.690\nthis example, cuz notice when I exported,\nI didn't specify users.\n\n476\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:35.048\nI just exported all of the objects out of\nthat OU, and one of them is the OU itself.\n\n477\n00:25:35.048 --> 00:25:37.750\nI can seeOU=Developers.\n\n478\n00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.150\nNow when I turn around and import this,\n\n479\n00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.680\nwell that was on the export,\nnot on this one, but same principle.\n\n480\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.910\nIf I turn around and import this,\nthis OU already exist.\n\n481\n00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.740\nSo let's see what happens\nwhen we fire this up?\n\n482\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.840\nWe're gonna do csvde, we're gonna do a -i,\n\n483\n00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.255\nto import, -f, and\nI'll give it the file name,\n\n484\n00:25:57.255 --> 00:26:02.642\nwhich is gonna be importhost.csv,\nand really that's it.\n\n485\n00:26:02.642 --> 00:26:03.559\nThat's all I have to tell.\n\n486\n00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:07.096\nI don't need to tell it what it already\nhas in the file, what attributes,\n\n487\n00:26:07.096 --> 00:26:08.018\nthings like that.\n\n488\n00:26:08.018 --> 00:26:11.552\nSo we'll hit enter, and here we go,\n\n489\n00:26:11.552 --> 00:26:16.022\nwe got an error on line 2: Already exists.\n\n490\n00:26:16.022 --> 00:26:20.330\nAn attempt was made to add an object\nwith the name that's already in use.\n\n491\n00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.850\nI can see 0 entries modified successfully.\n\n492\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:30.760\nAll right, so let's try adding a -k to the\nend of that command, and see what happens.\n\n493\n00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.740\nNow, I've got 4 entries\nmodified successfully.\n\n494\n00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.228\nWe'll go take a look at that\nDevelopment OU, or Developers OU.\n\n495\n00:26:40.228 --> 00:26:41.610\nThere we go.\n\n496\n00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:42.990\nThere's your account, Justin.\n\n497\n00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.069\nNo, that's not you, sorry.\n\n498\n00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:45.184\n[LAUGH] I saw Justin in there.\n\n499\n00:26:45.184 --> 00:26:46.321\n&gt;&gt; It's a common mistake.\n\n500\n00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:47.064\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n501\n00:26:47.064 --> 00:26:48.681\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When I hear that name, I'm like,\n\n502\n00:26:48.681 --> 00:26:49.730\nyeah, no, it's not me.\n\n503\n00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.947\nSo, it's okay.\n\n504\n00:26:50.947 --> 00:26:51.817\nI'll let this one slide now.\n\n505\n00:26:51.817 --> 00:26:53.294\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.\n\n506\n00:26:53.294 --> 00:26:55.680\n[LAUGH] All right, so,\n\n507\n00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.950\nthere we can see how CSVDE is allowing\nme to import multiple objects,\n\n508\n00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.940\nor create multiple objects, with one\nfell swoop, right, one nice command.\n\n509\n00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.320\nYou might have maybe HR,\nas they hire people, you've given\n\n510\n00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.650\nthem a spreadsheet that they use, and it's\ngot the appropriate columns in there, and\n\n511\n00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.890\nthe appropriate headers, and as they hire\npeople they just fill in this spreadsheet,\n\n512\n00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.110\nand then they save that\nspreadsheet as a CSV.\n\n513\n00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:24.059\nAnd they hand it over to you, and now\nyou go and you just import that CSV, and\n\n514\n00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:28.418\nyou call them right back, and all their\naccounts are created, we're good to go.\n\n515\n00:27:28.418 --> 00:27:31.193\nNow a couple of things of\nimportance we need to note here.\n\n516\n00:27:31.193 --> 00:27:33.906\nIf we look at these accounts,\nI know I can't really zoom in,\n\n517\n00:27:33.906 --> 00:27:37.060\nbut you see that little downward-pointing\narrow on there, Justin?\n\n518\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.650\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n519\n00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.210\n&gt;&gt; That is indicating that\nthose accounts are disabled.\n\n520\n00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.868\nOne of the limitations of CSVDE is it\ncannot import passwords, because it\n\n521\n00:27:45.868 --> 00:27:50.915\ndoesn't do secure connections of any kind,\nso it won't work with passwords.\n\n522\n00:27:50.915 --> 00:27:54.476\nAny account that gets created in Active\nDirectory in our modern operating systems\n\n523\n00:27:54.476 --> 00:27:57.190\nis going to be disabled if\nit doesn't have a password.\n\n524\n00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.990\nSo they're created.\n\n525\n00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:03.364\nI'm still gonna have to come back in\nhere and set a password, all right,\n\n526\n00:28:03.364 --> 00:28:04.305\non an account.\n\n527\n00:28:06.987 --> 00:28:10.820\nAnd then I will have to\nenable this account.\n\n528\n00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.270\nNow the account is good to go,\nTyler can login,\n\n529\n00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.290\nit'll ask him to change his password that\nfirst time, and we're off to the races.\n\n530\n00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.892\nAnd all those attributes,\nI didn't go that far, but\n\n531\n00:28:22.892 --> 00:28:26.815\nwe could use the department,\nthe company, the manager,\n\n532\n00:28:26.815 --> 00:28:32.195\nwe could do those attributes as well,\njust have to specify them in our CSV file.\n\n533\n00:28:32.195 --> 00:28:37.000\nSo that's our first tool, CSVDE, and\nI think I talked a little too much there,\n\n534\n00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.100\ndidn't I?\n\n535\n00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.840\n&gt;&gt; Well you know, sometimes we just\nget excited about topics, Mike,\n\n536\n00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.230\nand there's nothing that\nwe can do about it.\n\n537\n00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.426\nBut I think I know where you're going,\nbecause as it stands, CSVDE,\n\n538\n00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:51.902\nit automates some of the things, but\nthen when you told me I had to go back and\n\n539\n00:28:51.902 --> 00:28:56.382\nright-click, and modify passwords,\nand maybe it's not the best tool or\n\n540\n00:28:56.382 --> 00:29:00.183\nmaybe that's always what we have to do,\nbut I'm interested.\n\n541\n00:29:00.183 --> 00:29:03.340\nAre there other tooling,\nlike tool choices that we can make,\n\n542\n00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.779\nthat maybe well allows to\nbe a little more lazy?\n\n543\n00:29:05.779 --> 00:29:06.684\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n544\n00:29:06.684 --> 00:29:09.442\nThere's one called LDIV DE\nthat we're gonna look at, and\n\n545\n00:29:09.442 --> 00:29:11.483\nit still doesn't let me do the passwords.\n\n546\n00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:15.155\nI'm still gonna have to set a password and\nenable them, but\n\n547\n00:29:15.155 --> 00:29:18.620\nit will let me do some other\nthings that CSVDE won't do.\n\n548\n00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.056\nIt lets me modify existing objects and\neven remove objects, and\n\n549\n00:29:23.056 --> 00:29:27.985\nthen when we make our way to PowerShell,\nthat's where we're gonna get\n\n550\n00:29:27.985 --> 00:29:32.358\nthe full power in the ability\nto totally automate the process.\n\n551\n00:29:32.358 --> 00:29:35.717\n&gt;&gt; So, MIke, it looks like we're\ngonna have to come back for\n\n552\n00:29:35.717 --> 00:29:37.582\na part three to look at the lDIV?\n\n553\n00:29:37.582 --> 00:29:39.719\nlDIV, well, there you have it,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n554\n00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:43.195\nWe're gonna have to come back with a part\nthree to figure out how to continue\n\n555\n00:29:43.195 --> 00:29:47.125\nmanaging our users using, well, a few more\ntools that Mike's got queued up for us.\n\n556\n00:29:47.125 --> 00:29:49.273\nBut for this episode we're\ngonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n557\n00:29:49.273 --> 00:29:50.689\nBut definitely stay tuned.\n\n558\n00:29:50.689 --> 00:29:54.276\nSo for now, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n559\n00:29:54.276 --> 00:29:55.194\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n560\n00:29:55.194 --> 00:29:56.192\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n561\n00:29:57.481 --> 00:30:03.309\n[MUSIC]\n\n562\n00:30:03.309 -->

00:00:11.822\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:15.283\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:19.743\nI'm your host Justin Dennison and\nwe're back with a part three in our active\n\n6\n00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:24.006\ndirectory users and computers kind of\nI guess mini series at this point.\n\n7\n00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:30.280\nAnd we're back to talk about a final set\nof pooling to help administer our users.\n\n8\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.690\nAnd luckily we have the man that is going\nto lead us to the promised land, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.390\nMike Roderick.\n\n10\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.559\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Justin we'll see\nabout the promised land, but\n\n11\n00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.069\nwe are going to be taking a look,\nat another one of those tools.\n\n12\n00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:42.387\nThat we can use to start automating\nthe creation of objects within\n\n13\n00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:43.760\nActive Directory.\n\n14\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.656\nThis one is LDIFDE,\nL-D-I-F-D-E, stands for\n\n15\n00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:56.893\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol Data\nInterchange Format Directory Exchange,\n\n16\n00:00:56.893 --> 00:00:58.212\nyeah.\n\n17\n00:00:58.212 --> 00:01:02.180\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I wasn't even the one saying\nthat and I got winded just watching you.\n\n18\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.050\nSo we have an internal\nacronym within acronym that\n\n19\n00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.340\nactually uses the word directory,\nwhat, three times?\n\n20\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think three times in there.\n\n21\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.470\n&gt;&gt; Three times?\n\n22\n00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.760\n&gt;&gt; It's just crazy, anyway,\nit is still a cool tool.\n\n23\n00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.930\nWe're gonna call it LDIF for\nshort or LDIFDE for short.\n\n24\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.386\nAnd it's surprisingly similar to CSVDE.\n\n25\n00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:23.954\nSo you start getting familiar with that\ntool, you're really two steps ahead when\n\n26\n00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:27.210\nit comes to LDIFDE because it\ndoes the same thing, right?\n\n27\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.440\nWe're importing objects\ninto Active Directory,\n\n28\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.170\nwe're exporting objects\nout of Active Directory.\n\n29\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.208\nWith CSVDE I could create new objects and\n\n30\n00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:41.026\nexport existing objects LDIF steps it\nup a notch, now we can export objects.\n\n31\n00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:43.710\nWe can import and create new objects.\n\n32\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.540\nWe can also modify existing objects,\nas well as delete existing objects.\n\n33\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.025\nSo a couple new skills brought to\nthe table with the particular tool or\n\n34\n00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:56.325\ncapabilities I should say\nwith this particular tool.\n\n35\n00:01:56.325 --> 00:01:59.615\nIt also uses a completely\ndifferent format.\n\n36\n00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:03.361\nWe're not talking about\ncomma separated values here.\n\n37\n00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:08.023\nThey're LDIF files or LDF files and\nI've got an example of one.\n\n38\n00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:09.479\nSo let's go ahead and take a peak so\n\n39\n00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.760\nwe can start wrapping our head around\nwhat these are gonna look like.\n\n40\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.420\nThis is something we're gonna use\nto import in just a little bit,\n\n41\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.020\nI went ahead and\ncreated it ahead of time for us.\n\n42\n00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.580\nAnd this my LDF file, right.\n\n43\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.775\nNow remember with CSVDEs,\nwe had multiple rows.\n\n44\n00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:29.018\nAnd on that first row, it was like my\nheader row, right, it defined the order\n\n45\n00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:33.320\nthat the attributes were gonna appear in,\nand was separated by commas.\n\n46\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.570\nAnd then the next row is an object, and\nall the values separated by commas.\n\n47\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.190\nAnd then the next row is\na completely separate object,all\n\n48\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.570\nthe values separated by commas.\n\n49\n00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.012\nWith LDF files, each attribute\nis on its own line, all right.\n\n50\n00:02:48.012 --> 00:02:52.680\nSo like when we look at this first object,\nI've got distinguished name and\n\n51\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.650\nthen here's the distinguished name for\nthat object.\n\n52\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.510\nNo comma at the end,\ndon't need a comma to separate my values,\n\n53\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.640\nbecause the next value's\non a different line.\n\n54\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.670\nI'm really separating them with a carriage\nreturn I guess you could say, right?\n\n55\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.770\nSo here's the next,\n\n56\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.440\nthis is actually not an attribute per se,\nthis is the change type.\n\n57\n00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.120\nWe'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n58\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.390\nBut we get down here, I can see object\nclass, user, surname McCaffrey,\n\n59\n00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.370\ngiven name Erin, sAMAccountName,\nand user principal name.\n\n60\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.830\nSo I used all the same attributes so we\ncan kinda compare apples to almost apples,\n\n61\n00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.980\nright, as we look at these\ntwo different files.\n\n62\n00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.910\nAnd then what you see at the end of\nthis object there's a blank line.\n\n63\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.200\nAnd then there's another\nblock of information.\n\n64\n00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.990\nWell, each one of these\nblocks is an object and\n\n65\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.440\nobjects are separated by a blank line.\n\n66\n00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.150\nSo that's how we're gonna differentiate.\n\n67\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.332\nWhereas CSVDE,\neach object's on its own line.\n\n68\n00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:49.590\nIn LDF each object as a blank line or\n\n69\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.720\na carriage return in between them\nto separate out those values.\n\n70\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.980\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I noticed something about\nthis record that I actually didn't see in\n\n71\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.010\nthe CSV that we looked at\nin a previous episode.\n\n72\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.180\nThat object class, we have a top personal\norganizational person and a user.\n\n73\n00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.690\nThose are duplicate values,\nI guess those kind of all get aggregated.\n\n74\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.260\nIt's actually a lot easier\nto read here than in CSV.\n\n75\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.040\nWere those same things in\nthe CSV that we saw before?\n\n76\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.820\n&gt;&gt; You didn't see the object classes.\n\n77\n00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.390\nYou can actually return them\nif you choose to do so, but\n\n78\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.020\nit doesn't come out by default\nwhen you do an export.\n\n79\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.160\nHere when you export the object class\nit includes the entire hierarchy\n\n80\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.040\nof classes there.\n\n81\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.420\nSo user is a class within\n\n82\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.470\norganizationalPerson within\nperson within top.\n\n83\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.500\nSo they've gonna got some\nnested classes going on.\n\n84\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.580\n&gt;&gt; So if I were to write a record, right,\n\n85\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.507\none of these blocks that\nhave newlines between them,\n\n86\n00:04:39.507 --> 00:04:43.361\nIf I was going to write object class\nas something to use with this tool.\n\n87\n00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:45.953\nI need to be aware that\nthe older matters for\n\n88\n00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:49.510\nobject class in particular\nbased on hierarchy, right.\n\n89\n00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.280\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n90\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.310\nI tell you,\nthe best way to make one of these files,\n\n91\n00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.910\nin my opinion,\nis to export something, right.\n\n92\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.860\nJust do a simple a export.\n\n93\n00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.590\nEven if you don't need it for anything,\nexport a single user account or\n\n94\n00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.140\na few user accounts,\npick the attributes that you want.\n\n95\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.950\nOr that you're gonna be working with,\nand create this file.\n\n96\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.220\nCuz and that's exactly how I made this.\n\n97\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.340\nI exported out all of my hosts.\n\n98\n00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.371\nAnd then I turned around and replaced all\nthe information with unique stuff that\n\n99\n00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:16.540\nwe're gonna go back in and\nadd in just a little bit right.\n\n100\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.180\nThat way I know that all of\nthis Is in the correct format,\n\n101\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.480\nit's got the right name and\neverything is good.\n\n102\n00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.070\nI don't have to go wait what was\nthat order for the object class?\n\n103\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.140\nSo much easier way to do that, in my\nopinion, is just to export things out.\n\n104\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.900\nSo in this case I think I got\nthree different user objects\n\n105\n00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.500\nthat we're going to attempt to\nimport once we get around to that.\n\n106\n00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.150\nAll right, so\n\n107\n00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.270\nnow we know what an LDF file looks like,\nlet's see how we can create one.\n\n108\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.200\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart by opening up a command prompt, and\n\n109\n00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.420\nwe're going to export some data.\n\n110\n00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.216\nSo as we do with most of our tools,\n\n111\n00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:53.170\nLDIFDE switch question mark and\nI can get my syntax.\n\n112\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.590\nLet's take a look at\nsome of the parameters,\n\n113\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.660\nthe switches I can use with this command.\n\n114\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.861\nWhat you're going to see,\nas I mentioned earlier,\n\n115\n00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.567\nIt's almost the same as LDF, I mean CSVDE.\n\n116\n00:06:03.567 --> 00:06:06.500\nThe default is export,\nlet me switch to mark mode here.\n\n117\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.745\nThe default is export,\n-i if I want to change it to import,\n\n118\n00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:15.220\n-f to tell it what file name I'm importing\nfrom or where I want to export to.\n\n119\n00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.310\nI still have my switch D to tell\nwhere in the tree I want to start.\n\n120\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.660\nWhere's my root distinguished name\nthat we're going to export from.\n\n121\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.680\nI've got my -r for filter,\nmy -p for search scope,\n\n122\n00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.580\nL for list, O for omit list, so\nyou see they're really the same.\n\n123\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.460\nThere's the dash K for\nignoring errors and continuing on.\n\n124\n00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.540\nSo as far as those go,\neverything is the same.\n\n125\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.332\nAll right so\nif we want to export something out then,\n\n126\n00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:46.860\nit should be pretty simple.\n\n127\n00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.430\nWe're gonna do LDIFDE and we'll do-\nf until, you know what let me switch\n\n128\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.770\nover to that directory make my\nlife a little bit easier, c:\\.\n\n129\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.200\nThis time we will be in LDF and you can,\nand then use the right folder this time.\n\n130\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.470\nAnd we're gonna type in again, ldifde -f\nto tell it where I want to export to.\n\n131\n00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.140\nI didn't have to say export,\nbecause that's the default.\n\n132\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.380\nSo -f, and we'll call this,\n\n133\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.480\nwe are going to export, what did I\nsay we were gonna export on this one?\n\n134\n00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.900\nI'll do host again It's going\nto be \".ldf\" for the file type,\n\n135\n00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.278\nthen I'm going to do \"-r\", and I'm going\nto do, this is, remember \"-r\" is a filter?\n\n136\n00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:34.330\nAnd remember how last time when I did the\nexport with 'csvde\" it included the \"ou\",\n\n137\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.630\nand that cause a problem later on.\n\n138\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.490\nWell this time I'm gonna say okay,\nI'm gonna learn from my mistake and\n\n139\n00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.000\nwe're gonna filter out and\nsay just the user account.\n\n140\n00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.580\nDon't do the OU itself.\n\n141\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.697\nSo object class is gonna equal user.\n\n142\n00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:54.889\nNotice that filter does\ngo inside parenthesis.\n\n143\n00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:57.891\nAnd we can do our ampersands, our ands.\n\n144\n00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:00.793\nWe can include more than one filter.\n\n145\n00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:06.990\n-d, and I'm gonna tell it where I want to\nstart, that's my root distinguished name.\n\n146\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:14.520\nSo, I'm going to say ou=hosts,\nwhich is inside the ou=employees file.\n\n147\n00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.610\nThere we go, employees,\nwhich is inside my domain components lab,\n\n148\n00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:30.000\ndomain component itpro, domain component\ntv, in my distinguished name there.\n\n149\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.938\nAnd we're gonna not get every attribute,\nso\n\n150\n00:08:32.938 --> 00:08:36.038\nwe'll use a -l to list\nthe attributes we want.\n\n151\n00:08:36.038 --> 00:08:39.410\nAnd we'll keep it the same, so we can kind\nof, again, try to compare our results.\n\n152\n00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.000\nWe'll get distinguished name,\nwe'll get surname, we will get,\n\n153\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.390\nwhat else do we want?\n\n154\n00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.130\nI was gonna get the object class as well,\nwe'll do object class,\n\n155\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.840\nwe'll see that in there.\n\n156\n00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.690\nWe're gonna do the surname,\nwe're gonna do the given name.\n\n157\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.800\nThis time I'm not doing case,\nso forgive me for that.\n\n158\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.837\nWe're gonna do samaccountname, and\n\n159\n00:09:02.837 --> 00:09:07.384\nwe'll also get that user principal name.\n\n160\n00:09:09.071 --> 00:09:12.103\nI always have to double check myself\non that one, is it principal or\n\n161\n00:09:12.103 --> 00:09:13.086\nprinciple, right?\n\n162\n00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:14.727\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND].\n\n163\n00:09:14.727 --> 00:09:16.255\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; I'm probably not a good\n\n164\n00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:19.228\nperson to ask about that, Mike,\nI'm just like, looks good.\n\n165\n00:09:19.228 --> 00:09:20.349\n&gt;&gt; So I won't do that [LAUGH].\n\n166\n00:09:20.349 --> 00:09:22.510\n&gt;&gt; is it underlined,\nis there a green underline here?\n\n167\n00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; If there's not, then just ship it,\n\n168\n00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.086\nthen we're good.\n\n169\n00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:27.099\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI think we've got everything there,\n\n170\n00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.440\nwe'll keep our fingers crossed.\n\n171\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.380\nWe'll hit Enter, and there we go,\n\n172\n00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.310\nit looks like we succeeded because we\ncan see that six entries were exported.\n\n173\n00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.901\nIf we take a look at my directory,\nthere is my exporthosts.ldf, and\n\n174\n00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:43.766\nif we Notepad that guy, We'll see it looks\n\n175\n00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:46.790\njust like the other one that I\nshowed you a minute ago, right?\n\n176\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:52.015\nWe can see the users, the distinguished\nname, all the attributes that I asked for,\n\n177\n00:09:52.015 --> 00:09:55.043\nobject class is broken\nout into its entire tree.\n\n178\n00:09:55.043 --> 00:09:58.974\nChange type is listed as add, and\nit's kind of odd to see that there cuz,\n\n179\n00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:02.620\nwait a second,\nwe weren't adding anything, we exported.\n\n180\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.490\nFor some reason, it just defaults to add,\nbut this is where you're gonna change.\n\n181\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.538\nIf you were truly creating a new object,\nadd is what you're gonna wanna do.\n\n182\n00:10:10.538 --> 00:10:12.742\nSo I believe that's why\nthey default to add,\n\n183\n00:10:12.742 --> 00:10:17.270\ncuz then you can just tweak this file,\nchange the names, and you're good to go.\n\n184\n00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.910\nBut add creates new objects, if I was\ngonna remove something, it's remove.\n\n185\n00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.685\nIf I was gonna delete something,\nit's change type remove.\n\n186\n00:10:25.685 --> 00:10:30.720\nAnd if I was gonna change an existing\nobject, it's gonna be change type modify.\n\n187\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.320\nBut then I've gotta do a little more\ndown here, I've gotta tell it what\n\n188\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.660\nattribute I'm changing,\nthe original value, and the new value.\n\n189\n00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.239\nHere we're just gonna be\ncreating new ones, so\n\n190\n00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.696\nadd is gonna be the key\nword we're gonna use.\n\n191\n00:10:41.696 --> 00:10:46.178\nBut this is my export, again,\nwe're gonna import that other file,\n\n192\n00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:47.740\nright, so far so good.\n\n193\n00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.406\nWe've seen the tool, and really honestly\nwasn't any different, except for\n\n194\n00:10:52.406 --> 00:10:54.823\nmy filter, which we didn't have to do.\n\n195\n00:10:54.823 --> 00:10:58.840\nThere was really no difference\nfrom using CSVD and LFD.\n\n196\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.549\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike,\nI can see the use of the filter there,\n\n197\n00:11:01.549 --> 00:11:04.831\ncuz we kinda got bit by that\nextra record that was in the CSV.\n\n198\n00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:09.167\nYeah, that causes problems sometimes,\nlet's just kinda ship that by the wayside.\n\n199\n00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:12.280\nSo these are things that you're probably\ngonna learn as you play around with these\n\n200\n00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.915\nthings, this is a nice little trick.\n\n201\n00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:18.390\nMake sure that you only get user\nobjects from this respective chunk.\n\n202\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.930\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and this is just a test\nenvironment where I've gone in and\n\n203\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.250\ncreated a few users.\n\n204\n00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.811\nBut if you're dealing with an OU,\nor know your substructure or\n\n205\n00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.768\nsubtree that has hundreds\nof thousands of objects,\n\n206\n00:11:29.768 --> 00:11:33.008\nyou really wanna be specific\nwith what you're getting.\n\n207\n00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:35.515\nBecause when you look at that file,\nand there's a few lines for\n\n208\n00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:36.520\neach one of those users.\n\n209\n00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.590\nAnd if you get all of the attributes,\nfor example, you're looking at many,\n\n210\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.380\nmany rows for each user.\n\n211\n00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.120\nAnd then if you just have hundreds\nof users, it's a lot of information.\n\n212\n00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.922\nSo you wanna be careful and make sure\nyou're filtering it appropriately.\n\n213\n00:11:48.922 --> 00:11:52.330\nAll right, or get it all; maybe you\nwanna see everything you've got in\n\n214\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.800\nActive Directory, and you want to\njust watch it scroll by the screen.\n\n215\n00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.190\nOf course, you can output this stuff,\n\n216\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.162\nas you see, to a file, so you don't\njust have to look at it on screen.\n\n217\n00:11:59.162 --> 00:12:03.860\nAll right, now, the next thing I want\nto do is try to do an import, so\n\n218\n00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.485\nlet's see how that's going to work.\n\n219\n00:12:05.485 --> 00:12:10.380\nldifde, and then just -i to import,\n\n220\n00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.180\nright, and then tell it where it's\ncoming from, -f and the file name.\n\n221\n00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.240\nWe're gonna import my marketing users,\nso I've talked to HR,\n\n222\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.200\nthey gave me this file, here it is,\nneed you to create these accounts.\n\n223\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.596\nWe run our command, and\nI've got zero entries in there.\n\n224\n00:12:28.596 --> 00:12:32.041\n[SOUND] Now this one,\nlet's take a look and see what we've got,\n\n225\n00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:33.678\ncan you spot it yet, Justin?\n\n226\n00:12:33.678 --> 00:12:38.180\n&gt;&gt; So I've got a real quick question,\nand I was thinking about this before.\n\n227\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.550\nPreviously, we elevated our\nprivileges in the command prompt.\n\n228\n00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.100\nWell, for read, that may not be necessary,\nbut here, it says access is denied.\n\n229\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.560\nDo we need, any type of modification or\nupdates, do we need to go ahead and\n\n230\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.040\nmake sure we're running as\nan admin command prompt?\n\n231\n00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.838\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you nailed it on the head\nthere, you can see it, access is denied.\n\n232\n00:12:56.838 --> 00:12:59.277\nSo I'm trying to write\nto Active Directory, and\n\n233\n00:12:59.277 --> 00:13:02.920\nmy command prompt does not have\nthe appropriate credentials.\n\n234\n00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.210\nNow, what rights do I need,\nadministrator would be fine, right.\n\n235\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.650\nIf I'm the domain admin, I definitely\nhave full control over the OU.\n\n236\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.220\nBut there are other ways we can do that,\n\n237\n00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.160\nwe don't have to be the domain\nadmin to run this tool.\n\n238\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.060\nI might have delegated, something\nwe haven't learned about yet, but\n\n239\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.610\nmaybe I delegated to Justin.\n\n240\n00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.510\nHe's the sales manager, and\nhe's the one that's responsible for\n\n241\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.100\ncreating all the sales\nuser accounts in that OU.\n\n242\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.630\nI could delegate write permissions or\n\n243\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.410\ncreate new object permissions to Justin,\nfor just that particular OU.\n\n244\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.140\nAnd so then he could run his\ncommand prompt, run this command.\n\n245\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.335\nAnd as long as he didn't modify where\nhe was trying to create the object,\n\n246\n00:13:37.335 --> 00:13:38.160\nhe'd be good to go.\n\n247\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.610\nIf he tried to write anywhere else,\nhe would have a permission issue.\n\n248\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:45.245\nSo I don't wanna say you have\nto be an admin to do this, but\n\n249\n00:13:45.245 --> 00:13:46.260\nyou're exactly right.\n\n250\n00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.040\nThere are permissions that we have to\nconsider when you're making new objects or\n\n251\n00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.884\nmodifying existing objects, right?\n\n252\n00:13:51.884 --> 00:13:55.409\nIf you don't have the modify permission\nover that object in Active Directory,\n\n253\n00:13:55.409 --> 00:13:59.130\nyou're not gonna be able to run\na command that's modifying that object.\n\n254\n00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:03.001\nIf you're trying to remove an object from\nan active directory, well, you need those\n\n255\n00:14:03.001 --> 00:14:06.737\ndelete permissions or modify permissions\nover that object in Active Directory.\n\n256\n00:14:06.737 --> 00:14:11.143\nCommand's not gonna give you a shortcut to\nbypass any permissions, in other words, or\n\n257\n00:14:11.143 --> 00:14:12.226\nanything like that.\n\n258\n00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:16.763\nAll right, so let's try it,\nlet's go ahead and run that command\n\n259\n00:14:16.763 --> 00:14:21.232\nprompt as an administrator,\nall right, and see what we can do.\n\n260\n00:14:21.232 --> 00:14:23.505\nThis time I'll stay in this directory,\nand I'll show you,\n\n261\n00:14:23.505 --> 00:14:26.690\nI've been switching to the directory,\nand then just using the file name.\n\n262\n00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.187\nYou don't have to do that, you can\nspecify the entire path on the line.\n\n263\n00:14:31.187 --> 00:14:35.615\nSo we can do ldefde -i to import, -f for\n\n264\n00:14:35.615 --> 00:14:40.564\nmy filename, and\nthen just the entire path,\n\n265\n00:14:40.564 --> 00:14:46.170\nright ldefde switch importmarketing.ldf.\n\n266\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.845\nSo I'll run that command again, and\n\n267\n00:14:48.845 --> 00:14:53.084\nnow I can see I have three\nentries modified successfully.\n\n268\n00:14:53.084 --> 00:14:57.450\nAnd if we go take a look at Active\nDirectory and we go down to Marketing,\n\n269\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.940\nthere they are, Amanda, Erin,\nand Vicki, all read to go.\n\n270\n00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.210\nNotice, again,\nget that little downward black arrow,\n\n271\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.900\nindicating these accounts are disabled.\n\n272\n00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.317\nJustin, any guesses as\nto why they're disabled?\n\n273\n00:15:10.317 --> 00:15:13.150\n&gt;&gt; Because we can't set passwords\neven with this ldif tool.\n\n274\n00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.150\nI thought you were gonna bring me to\nthe promised land, Mike, but I don't know.\n\n275\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.760\nI kind of like this tool\na little bit better because of\n\n276\n00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.610\nthe expanded capabilities, but\nstill don't have any passwords here.\n\n277\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.120\n&gt;&gt; Still don't have the ability\nto set those passwords.\n\n278\n00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.400\nAnd without a password, the account\nis definitely going to be disabled,\n\n279\n00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.480\nso it's still a manual end to it.\n\n280\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.250\nI shouldn't say that, we could turn\naround and use something like PowerShell\n\n281\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.590\nto modify these accounts, enable these\naccounts, set passwords, things like that.\n\n282\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.680\nSo we can take our automation,\n\n283\n00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.160\nwe haven't seen PowerShell yet,\nthat's gonna come up in a future episode.\n\n284\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.026\nAnd maybe we can go back and\nlook at how we can combine PowerShell and\n\n285\n00:15:48.026 --> 00:15:51.701\na couple of these tools to really\nfully automate that process.\n\n286\n00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.421\nBut I tell you,\nonce you start getting into PowerShell,\n\n287\n00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.468\nyou almost don't need these other tools.\n\n288\n00:15:56.468 --> 00:15:59.902\n&gt;&gt; And that kind of makes sense\nbecause these interchange formats,\n\n289\n00:15:59.902 --> 00:16:02.775\nboth CSV we seen in a previous episode,\nand LDVE here,\n\n290\n00:16:02.775 --> 00:16:05.980\nthat may just be a dump\nfrom like a dispora system.\n\n291\n00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.650\nBut I need to bring in, now I need to\nincorporate this into my organization, or\n\n292\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:15.200\nI need to do a mass bulk write or\nread of portions of my organization.\n\n293\n00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.220\nMaybe not necessarily the greatest for\nautomating all aspects.\n\n294\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.800\nSo I completely understand that.\n\n295\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.400\nNow I do have one final question for\n\n296\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.980\nyou Mike because LDVE has a little\nmore capabilities, I guess we\n\n297\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.090\nneed to be extra careful that we don't\naccidentally botch things up, right?\n\n298\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.980\nBecause we can modify records and\nas such right?\n\n299\n00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and so\n\n300\n00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.120\nthat's where again permissions\nare gonna come into play.\n\n301\n00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.940\nControlling what you can and\ncan't do with this, but\n\n302\n00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.710\nyou're right I can start\nremoving accounts.\n\n303\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.710\nIn fact, you know what, let's try.\n\n304\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.850\nShould we go off the cuff here and-\n&gt;&gt; I\n\n305\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.790\nthink that we should see how to\nmaybe delete a record right?\n\n306\n00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah let's see.\n\n307\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.180\nI have faith in your mind.\n\n308\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:55.970\n&gt;&gt; All right let's do it.\n\n309\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.370\nLet's go back over to our A file\nwe just used to import, and\n\n310\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.490\nwe'll just try it with one user.\n\n311\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.820\nSo, I'm just going to back out.\n\n312\n00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.390\nThis other, oops, not all of that.\n\n313\n00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.310\nWe'll take that out and\nwe're just going to change my change type,\n\n314\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.440\nthere's that redundancy again.\n\n315\n00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.640\nI'm just like Microsoft.\n\n316\n00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.960\nWe're going to change\nthis to Delete all right?\n\n317\n00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.020\nSo we'll change that, we'll save it,\n\n318\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.740\nand we'll run over to our prompt and\nwe'll run that command.\n\n319\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.730\nWe're just gonna import that file again\nhopefully I can find my command so\n\n320\n00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.310\nI don't have to type it all out.\n\n321\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:35.670\nWe'll run it and uh-oh,\nwe got a syntax error.\n\n322\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.540\nWe are in trouble.\n\n323\n00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.770\nI see zero entries modified.\n\n324\n00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.080\nThat's really one of the first\nthings I wanna look for\n\n325\n00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.380\nis, did anything get changed?\n\n326\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.590\nThen, I can go and\ntroubleshoot that error.\n\n327\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.390\nSo, Justin we got an issue here that says,\n\n328\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.025\nfailed online three of the last\ntoken starts with a d.\n\n329\n00:17:51.025 --> 00:17:55.740\nHm, all right, let's go back and\nlook at our file and\n\n330\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.130\nsee what we might think the problem is,\nany ideas?\n\n331\n00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:03.120\n&gt;&gt; So, my initial gut reaction based\non my experiences, like would expect\n\n332\n00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.640\nan extra character, or an extra new line\nand maybe you have a bad formatting but\n\n333\n00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.860\nbased on the other records\nthat we've seen previously,\n\n334\n00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.670\nI don't see anything\nthat's available there.\n\n335\n00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.900\nSo maybe it's not a parse\nerror like an extra character.\n\n336\n00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, hm.\n\n337\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no like,\n\n338\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.770\nI didn't have a semicolon after this or\nanything like that.\n\n339\n00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.840\n&gt;&gt; But I wonder like maybe that additional\ninformation is just unneccessary.\n\n340\n00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840\n&gt;&gt; There we go, right?\n\n341\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.600\nJust think about this.\n\n342\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.420\nThink about the logic behind it.\n\n343\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.110\nIf you are removing an object,\nI don't need to tell you,\n\n344\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.370\nI don't want to try to fill in attributes.\n\n345\n00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.880\nI'm not trying to create an object.\n\n346\n00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.270\nAll I need to do is identify\nthe object that I want to remove and\n\n347\n00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.960\nthen we want to remove it.\n\n348\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.630\nSo we are going to get rid of all this\nstuff as well and then we will save it,\n\n349\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.460\nand we will try it one more time.\n\n350\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.930\nNow I see one entry modified successfully.\n\n351\n00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.030\nGo back over to Erin active directory.\n\n352\n00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.540\nThere's Erin, wait it didn't work?\n\n353\n00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.130\nRefresh!\n\n354\n00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.470\nWe have to refresh.\n\n355\n00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.750\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n356\n00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.520\nI had complete and utter faith in you,\nMike, so, thanks for\n\n357\n00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.770\nliving on the edge with me.\n\n358\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.900\nNow, I know there's some other\ncapabilities there, but this illustrates.\n\n359\n00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.270\nLet's just try something,\nuse some of this logic and\n\n360\n00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.950\nit's not always just you know everything.\n\n361\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.510\nSo Mike before we head out for\n\n362\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.710\nthis episode,\nis there any final parting words for us.\n\n363\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.030\nWords of wisdom so to speak.\n\n364\n00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.520\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about wise words, but\nwhen it comes to these two tools.\n\n365\n00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.690\nPlay around with them, get familiar with\nthem, understand primarily the switches\n\n366\n00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.700\nthat you need to use with them, and\nthe format that the files should be in.\n\n367\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.830\nAnd understand what their\ncapabilities are, right?\n\n368\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.485\nThe CSV can import and can export,\nbut can't modify or delete.\n\n369\n00:19:44.485 --> 00:19:48.965\nThe LDVE can import and export but\nalso modify and delete.\n\n370\n00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:51.785\nThese are tools that have been around for\na long time, and\n\n371\n00:19:51.785 --> 00:19:55.115\nthere's newer ways to start\nautomating some of this.\n\n372\n00:19:55.115 --> 00:19:59.865\nLike powershell, so probably not\ngonna be a huge portion of the exam.\n\n373\n00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:03.880\nBut they very well could ask you, and\nwhen it comes to automation these\n\n374\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.630\nare two of the tools that we have\nused in the past, and still use.\n\n375\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.160\nIn fact, when we get into Powershell,\n\n376\n00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.810\nyou're gonna see that one of the commands\nthat we're gonna do is import.csv.\n\n377\n00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:18.580\nSo we still have the CSV file, we're just\nusing a different tool to parse that file.\n\n378\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.150\nSo, definitely a couple tools\nworth having in your tool belt,\n\n379\n00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.490\nthings like CSVD, it's so simple.\n\n380\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:30.280\nIt's not like I have to break\nout my instruction manual and\n\n381\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.330\nremember that power shell command or\nwrite a script for a new user.\n\n382\n00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.910\nI can simply dump it into a spreadsheet,\nsame as the CSV, and\n\n383\n00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.230\nrun a command with two switches,\ndash I dash F.\n\n384\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.672\nEnter, and I've got all these new users.\n\n385\n00:20:44.672 --> 00:20:47.438\nSo they're definitely worth\nknowing in my opinion.\n\n386\n00:20:47.438 --> 00:20:49.420\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\nI think you bring up some great points.\n\n387\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.890\nThey might not have everything we need,\n\n388\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.070\nbut it's a great start and\nthey're pretty easy to use.\n\n389\n00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.260\nAnd it's almost like, I know one,\nI know the other one right?\n\n390\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.170\nWell CSBDE as well as LDVE DE.\n\n391\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.240\nSo thank you so much for\ntaking us through that.\n\n392\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.450\nWell, we do have more Microsoft Server\n2012 coming at you, but for\n\n393\n00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.970\nthis episode,\nwe're going to go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n394\n00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.040\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your Justin Dennison.\n\n395\n00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n396\n00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.018\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n397\n00:21:13.018 --> 00:21:19.003\n[MUSIC]\n\n398\n00:21:19.003 --> 00:21:23.618\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
