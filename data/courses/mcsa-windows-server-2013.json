          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.758\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:12.563\nThe MCSA or Microsoft Certified\nSolutions Associate is one of\n\n3\n00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:16.210\nthe more popular\ncertifications from Microsoft.\n\n4\n00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.160\nIt's designed to be\na mid-tier certification.\n\n5\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.530\nGreater knowledge than somebody who's\njust getting started in IT, but\n\n6\n00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.450\nnot expert lever, level knowledge.\n\n7\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.330\nThis is somebody who's been working\nin the field for several years and\n\n8\n00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.700\nhas had exposure to large and enterprise\nsize deployments of Microsoft Windows.\n\n9\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.860\nThe MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 is probably the most\n\n10\n00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.900\ncommonly sought-after\ncertification with Microsoft.\n\n11\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.190\nThese are for technicians who are not\ngoing to be just working with desktops,\n\n12\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.450\nbut deploying Windows servers.\n\n13\n00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.130\nThese might be email servers,\nfile servers, print servers.\n\n14\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.040\nThey might be authentication servers.\n\n15\n00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.210\nThere's all sorts of different types\nof servers you might deploy, and\n\n16\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.640\nthe MCSA for Windows Server 2012\ncovers the majority of them.\n\n17\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.780\nIt shows typical deployment scenarios for\na server.\n\n18\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.290\nHow to deploy the software successfully,\nhow to secure the software and\n\n19\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.000\nensure things are working nice and\nsmooth, and how to troubleshoot and\n\n20\n00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.680\nisolate and correct issues when they\naren't running nice and smooth,\n\n21\n00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.080\nand that makes this really valuable.\n\n22\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.570\nIf you're working in IT and you're sitting\nat a help desk right now, or you're doing\n\n23\n00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.060\nfield repairs on computers and you're\nlooking to move to that next step in your\n\n24\n00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.560\ncareer, the MCSA for Windows Server\n2012 is normally that next step, right.\n\n25\n00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.090\nThis is what gets you out of the field and\nback at the data center.\n\n26\n00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.470\nGets you into the server room,\nworking in equipment there.\n\n27\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.360\nWhich is usually a little more\nexciting than supporting a desktop.\n\n28\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.850\nWhich can,\ncan over time become a bit monotonous.\n\n29\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.360\nI think we've all been there.\n\n30\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.210\nSo, let's take a look at\nthis certification and\n\n31\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.720\nget a better idea of what it entails.\n\n32\n00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.226\nAll right, the MCSA has been around for\nquite a while now.\n\n33\n00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:49.227\nI don't think it's actually\nreached ten years yet but it's,\n\n34\n00:01:49.227 --> 00:01:51.090\nit's a good seven years at least.\n\n35\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.410\nAnd it's designed to be the,\nwell that mid-tier certification.\n\n36\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.500\nThe name has changed a little\nbit over the years, but\n\n37\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.560\nnow it's just the Microsoft\nCertified Solutions Associate.\n\n38\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.500\nAnd Microsoft actually has\nseveral different ones.\n\n39\n00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.570\nThe one we're about to cover is\nthe one for Windows Server 2012.\n\n40\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.130\nIf your position within the company is\none that allows you to work on servers,\n\n41\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.900\nthat's what this is designed for.\n\n42\n00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.940\nIf you're still at the desktop level but\nyou want to move into the server world,\n\n43\n00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.390\nagain, this is the place\nthat you wanna go.\n\n44\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.600\nBut, if you're looking to\ndo desktop support, well,\n\n45\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.840\nthe server technologies,\nthey can be helpful.\n\n46\n00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.230\nThey help you to understand what's\ngoing on on the server side.\n\n47\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.440\nBut it's not necessarily\nthe right place for you to start.\n\n48\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.840\nYou typically want to go to the MCSA for\nWindows 8 or MCSA for Windows 7.\n\n49\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.250\nNow, if you're just\ngetting started in IT so\n\n50\n00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.250\nyou've got a resume full of other jobs and\nyou're looking to launch an IT career.\n\n51\n00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.460\nWell again the MCSA for Windows servers\nis not really a great starting point.\n\n52\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.120\nIn order to set up a server,\n\n53\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.590\nthere's a lot of foundational\nknowledge that you need to have.\n\n54\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.750\nSo if you're just starting out,\nI recommend you jump over to\n\n55\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.440\nlike the CompTIA A+ and\nCompTIA Network Plus certifications.\n\n56\n00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.940\nThose are great starting points for\nlaunching an IT career.\n\n57\n00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.470\nIf you're just getting started\nin technology altogether you\n\n58\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.440\nprobably wanna go to either\nthe CompTIA IT Fundamentals or the MTA,\n\n59\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.570\nthe Microsoft Technology Associate.\n\n60\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.410\nThat's designed for people that are just\ngetting their feet wet in the IT world.\n\n61\n00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.270\nYou'll learn about basic\noperating systems.\n\n62\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.740\nNow, that's foundational knowledge\nthat you're expected to already\n\n63\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.050\nhave by the time you get\nto the server level.\n\n64\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.400\nSo if you don't possess it,\n\n65\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.360\nthere's things that we'll cover in there\nthat might be a little over your head.\n\n66\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.940\nThat if you've missed\nthe foundational knowledge,\n\n67\n00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.600\nyou won't be able to build on top of it.\n\n68\n00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.120\nSo, definitely check out those\nother certifications if you\n\n69\n00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.560\nhaven't done those yet.\n\n70\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.770\nBut, if you're ready for\n\n71\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.650\nWindows Server, then the MCSA\n2012 is where you want to go.\n\n72\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.620\nNow, the MCSA 2012 is actually\nbuilt on three different exams,\n\n73\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.080\nand each one kind of divides\nthe topic up a little bit.\n\n74\n00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.350\nSo, here we can see the three\ndifferent exams, and\n\n75\n00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.410\nwe divide it here on ITPROTV\ninto three separate shows.\n\n76\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.840\nThere's the 70-410, 411 and 412 shows.\n\n77\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.940\nThe first one is installing and\nconfiguring Windows Server 2012.\n\n78\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.010\nIf this is the first time you've used it,\n\n79\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.140\nwe'll cover how to install\nWindows Server 2012.\n\n80\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.920\nHow to get it in place, and\nhow to add roles to it so\n\n81\n00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.670\nyour server can actually\nperform customized functions.\n\n82\n00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.540\nWe'll talk about\nthe Microsoft Active Directory,\n\n83\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.970\nwhich is a critical technology\nthroughout your server infrastructure.\n\n84\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.840\nWe'll talk about other security concepts,\nand just some of the neat bells and\n\n85\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.020\nwhistles that are included\nin Windows server.\n\n86\n00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.680\nThen, in 411, we go into\nAdministering Windows Server 2012.\n\n87\n00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.440\nOnce you've brought up these services,\nnow you need to administer them,\n\n88\n00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.280\nyou need to run them.\n\n89\n00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.100\nYou need to allow it to scale up\nto thousands, tens of thousands,\n\n90\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.680\nhundreds of thousands of users.\n\n91\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.000\nYou need to keep it operational and you\nneed to do some advanced functionality.\n\n92\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.540\nAnd what, that's what we cover in the\nAdministering Windows Server 2012 show.\n\n93\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.830\nAnd then the end of it is the 70-412\n\n94\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.930\nwhich is Configuring Advanced\nWindows Server 2012 Services.\n\n95\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.890\nWe actually revisit some of the services\nfrom the first two shows, and\n\n96\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.310\ngo more in depth,\nshowing some advanced configurations, and\n\n97\n00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.550\nthen we phase in some new technologies\nlike Active Directory Federated Services\n\n98\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.040\nthat are extremely complex and\nchallenging.\n\n99\n00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.780\nNot useful at all for\nsmall and medium businesses.\n\n100\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.990\nBut for large and\nenterprise businesses can revolutionize\n\n101\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.630\nthe way that you offer\nservices on the web.\n\n102\n00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.740\nSo, definitely stuff that you want\nto be aware of, and get exposed to.\n\n103\n00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.580\nNow these exams are designed to be taken\nin order, so you should start with 70 410.\n\n104\n00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.420\nAnd then go on to 411 and\nthen wrap it up with 412.\n\n105\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.170\nIf you take them out of order,\n\n106\n00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.270\neach exam assumes you already have\nthe knowledge from the prior exams.\n\n107\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.490\nSo for example if you start out on 412,\n\n108\n00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.680\nit assumes you already\nhave a passing knowledge.\n\n109\n00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.720\nLike you passed the exam,\nnot just in passing.\n\n110\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.540\nOf 410 and 411.\nIf you don't do that, you'll,\n\n111\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.340\nyou'll get over your head pretty quick and\nthen you get frustrated and\n\n112\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.470\nit's hard to be successful\nwhen you're frustrated.\n\n113\n00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.470\nSo you do wanna pursue those in order.\n\n114\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.220\nNow for me, I always recommend that\npeople go ahead and do all three.\n\n115\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.310\nJust watch all three in order.\n\n116\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.030\nEven before taking that 410 exam.\n\n117\n00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.890\nAnd the reason I say that is, each one\nbuilds on the one from before it so\n\n118\n00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.200\nthere's some overlap.\n\n119\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.560\nAnd that means you're seeing the same\ntechnologies multiple times and\n\n120\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.030\nyou learn more about it.\n\n121\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.860\nIf you were to watch all three of\nthese shows, 410, 411, and 412,\n\n122\n00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.690\nyou'll be much more likely to pass that\n410 exam the first time you go in there\n\n123\n00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.990\ncuz you've seen the technology so\nmany times.\n\n124\n00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.620\nAll right?\n\n125\n00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.120\nSo how you choose to watch\nthem is ultimately up to you,\n\n126\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.360\nbut at a minimum,\nyou do want to watch them in order.\n\n127\n00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.550\nStart with 410, and\nthen move through each.\n\n128\n00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.800\nWhen you're ready to take the exam,\nthe exams are administered through\n\n129\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.540\nPearson VUE, so\nyou'll just jump over to their website.\n\n130\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.930\nYou can go straight to it at\nwww.pearsonvue.com/Microsoft.\n\n131\n00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.770\nThat'll take you to Microsoft's page.\n\n132\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.957\nAnd remember VUE is spelled V U E and\nso it's pearsonvue.com/microsoft.\n\n133\n00:06:53.957 --> 00:06:59.200\nThe exams are $150 a piece and\nyou gotta take three of them so\n\n134\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.510\nunfortunately there is a little bit\nof a shock to the wallet on this one.\n\n135\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.500\nAssuming you pass on the first time it'll\nbe about $450 to take the three exams.\n\n136\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.420\nOnce you pass,\nyou get your MCSA Window's Server 2012.\n\n137\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.830\nNow the MCSA Windows Server 2012 is also\nthe first step in obtaining the MCSE.\n\n138\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.120\nSo once you've completed this\ncertification the next step is that\n\n139\n00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.840\nMCSE that you hear a lot\nof people talk about.\n\n140\n00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.310\nRight, that's the, the certification\nMicrosoft has that's the most famous.\n\n141\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.720\nEverybody's heard of the MCSE.\n\n142\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.500\nAnd that's a lot of people's goal.\n\n143\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.490\nBut, the MCSE is not designed for\nsomebody getting started.\n\n144\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.140\nIt's for somebody who's already\ngot a wealth of experience.\n\n145\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.430\nAlready has their MCSA, and\n\n146\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.450\nis moving into that larger\nconsultant type design environment.\n\n147\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.380\nAnd that's a lot different than the person\nwho's doing the day to day work.\n\n148\n00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.710\nThe MCSA is for the doer.\n\n149\n00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.810\nThe person who's in the field.\n\n150\n00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.600\nThe grunt who's actually\nmaking things happen.\n\n151\n00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.750\nRight?\nYou're the one bringing up servers and\n\n152\n00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.310\ntroubleshooting.\n\n153\n00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.160\nReplacing hard drives.\n\n154\n00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.260\nYou're the one who's\nactually making things work.\n\n155\n00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.220\nSo in a lot of ways, the knowledge we\ncover in the MCSA certification is more\n\n156\n00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.140\nvaluable than what we learn in the MCSE\nand the MCSA is a lot more entertaining in\n\n157\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.770\nmy opinion because you know, you get\nto use a lot of these technologies.\n\n158\n00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.280\nSo keep that in mind as you go through and\n\n159\n00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.570\nstudy that the MCSA is a great place to\nstart if you're already somebody who has\n\n160\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.110\nthat experience and you're looking to get\nthat documented, get it on your resume and\n\n161\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.200\nlearn all the different things\nthat Windows Server 2012 can do.\n\n162\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.070\nAll right, well, if that's what you're\nlooking for, you're in the right place.\n\n163\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.200\nStay tuned, our episodes are coming up.\n\n164\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.510\nIf not, keep in mind all the other\ncertifications that I mentioned.\n\n165\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.590\nThere's an appropriate one for\nyou in there somewhere.\n\n166\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.720\nYou just gotta look to find it and\nthen pursue your goal.\n\n167\n00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.890\nRegardless of which route you go,\nI wish you the best of luck on your exam.\n\n168\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.320\nAnd for those of you sticking with me,\n\n169\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.272\nI'll see you in the episodes\nhere in just a moment.\n\n170\n00:08:46.272 --> 00:08:53.079\n[SOUND]\n\n",
