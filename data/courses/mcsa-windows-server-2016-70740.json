ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.153 --> 00:00:18.221\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:22.910\nin today's episode we begin\nour series on installation.\n\n5\n00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.290\nThis is a long title, so bear with me.\n\n6\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.770\nInstallation, storage and compute with\nWindows Server 2016, that's right,\n\n7\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.900\nthe new hotness available from Microsoft.\n\n8\n00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.710\nJoining us in the studio today to\nlend his expertise on that topic,\n\n9\n00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.140\nthe Microsoft man himself,\nMr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.970\nMike, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.800\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.888\n>> It's going fantastic.\n\n13\n00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:45.460\nI'm excited cuz we are starting\nthat journey, as you said,\n\n14\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.540\nwith Server 2016 and\nI love My Windows Server.\n\n15\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.470\n>> You do.\n>> And man, what a title.\n\n16\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.610\n>> I know.\n>> I'm glad it was on you, not me.\n\n17\n00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.000\nI didn't want to have to say that.\n\n18\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.362\n>> Little verbose [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:57.754\n>> Barely fits across the bottom\nof our screen down there.\n\n20\n00:00:57.754 --> 00:01:02.361\nBut as you can see, we are gonna be\ninstalling, looking at storage and\n\n21\n00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.180\nlooking at compute.\n\n22\n00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.150\nWhen it comes to Windows Server 2016,\ngearing up for those new\n\n23\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.740\nset of exams that are gonna be coming\nout pretty soon for 2016 with your MCSA.\n\n24\n00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.191\nAnd they've rearranged\nthings a little bit, so\n\n25\n00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.636\ndon't expect it to go like it did\nwith 2012 and 2008 and 2003 and 2000.\n\n26\n00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:23.472\nOf course,\nthey just had to change it up, you know?\n\n27\n00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:24.134\n>> Of course.\n\n28\n00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:26.748\n>> We kind of used to start off with\nthings like Active Directory and DNS.\n\n29\n00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:31.343\nHere we're gonna start out with again,\nlearning about installing it,\n\n30\n00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:34.690\nsetting up storage, working with compute.\n\n31\n00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.900\nAnd then we move into gosh,\n\n32\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.460\nI think the second one deals\nwith some of the infrastructure.\n\n33\n00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.150\nAnd then the third one is gonna deal\nwith identity where we get into\n\n34\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.310\nActive Directory, rights management,\nfederation and all that good stuff.\n\n35\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.380\nSo this one again,\nis a first in the series.\n\n36\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.630\nAnd with all of Microsoft Server's\nclasses where we first start out,\n\n37\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.170\nwhat's the first thing\nwe have learned about?\n\n38\n00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.360\nGetting it installed, right?\n\n39\n00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360\nWe can't do much when it's\non that disk in our hands.\n\n40\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.850\nSo we've gotta put it in there and\nget this installed.\n\n41\n00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.270\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n42\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.030\nAnd before we go to install, we need to\nknow about all the minimum requirements.\n\n43\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.808\nSo that we can be successful with our\ninstalls, so let's cover those real quick.\n\n44\n00:02:12.808 --> 00:02:16.810\nWe're not gonna drag it out, just\na little bit of memorization to it and\n\n45\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.930\nthey might ask you one or\ntwo questions on the exam about it.\n\n46\n00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.580\nSo like I said I wouldn't spend too much\ntime remember, they've actually simplified\n\n47\n00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.340\nit a little bit addition wise at least for\nnow it's a lot better than it was.\n\n48\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.390\nSo processor wise,\n1.4 gigahertz 64-bit processor.\n\n49\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.610\nAgain, when we talk about these we're\ntalking minimum requirements, right?\n\n50\n00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.700\nThat means you can\nsuccessfully install it,\n\n51\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.690\nyou might not like what\nyou've got afterwards and\n\n52\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.310\nyou might not be able to run anything\non it, but you can get it installed.\n\n53\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.540\nSo one point-\n>> I can see them getting a real bad rap.\n\n54\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.220\nPeople going, man this thing\nruns horrible, it's so slow.\n\n55\n00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.550\nYou're running it on the bare\nrequirements there, buddy.\n\n56\n00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.616\nIt will run, but\nwe didn't say it would run well [LAUGH].\n\n57\n00:03:00.616 --> 00:03:01.255\n>> That's right.\n\n58\n00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:04.178\nThat's why they're called\nminimum requirements.\n\n59\n00:03:04.178 --> 00:03:08.650\n1.4 gigahertz, 64-bit processor,\ncompatible with a 64-bit instruction set.\n\n60\n00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.483\nYou do need to support a second\nlevel address translation or\n\n61\n00:03:13.483 --> 00:03:16.780\nSLAT for short, as well as NX and or DEP.\n\n62\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.459\nThe no execution bit or\nthe data execution prevention,\n\n63\n00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.200\ndepending on what platform\nyou're on there, Intel, AMD.\n\n64\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.410\nSo those are our requirements for\nour processor, for\n\n65\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.870\nour memory, 512 megabytes of RAM,\nyeah, not very much.\n\n66\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.170\nBut again, that's just to get\nthe operating system installed.\n\n67\n00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.330\nIf you're running Core, you might be\nable to get away with using that if you\n\n68\n00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.170\ndon't dump too many rolls on there.\n\n69\n00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.600\nBut as you add more and\nmore rolls, remember,\n\n70\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.240\nthese are just the minimum requirements\nfor the operating system itself.\n\n71\n00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.550\nNothing to do with what you're gonna\nrun on top of that operating system.\n\n72\n00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.800\nIf you're gonna make it a domain\ncontroller, a DNS server, A DHCP server.\n\n73\n00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.783\nEach one of those roles has requirements.\n\n74\n00:03:56.783 --> 00:04:00.940\nSo you'd have to start adding up, all\nright, I need 512 for my operating system.\n\n75\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.657\nI need a gig for [INAUDIBLE] and all this\nkind of thing, iou'd add them all up.\n\n76\n00:04:03.657 --> 00:04:04.980\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n77\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.610\nBut 512 minimum with error correction code\nor ECC type memory is the way we wanna go.\n\n78\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.780\nI know I've read a couple of notes too.\n\n79\n00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.288\nIf you try to do it in a virtual\nmachine with 512 megs of RAM,\n\n80\n00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:22.610\nit's probably gonna fail,\neven though 512 is listed as the minimum.\n\n81\n00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.620\nThey say bump it up to about 800,\n900 megs, get it installed,\n\n82\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.900\nthen you can drop it back down to 512\nif you really are that tight on memory.\n\n83\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.720\nIt has to do with the expansion of all\nthe files and get everything set up.\n\n84\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.490\nIt can run with 512,\n\n85\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.310\nit fails if you try to do\nthe installation with that 512 in a VM.\n\n86\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.301\nSo something to keep in mind again,\nthat's not in the exam,\n\n87\n00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:48.702\nthat's just for your FYI,\nif that's not redundant for your FYI.\n\n88\n00:04:48.702 --> 00:04:50.084\n>> For your information.\n\n89\n00:04:50.084 --> 00:04:52.831\n>> So the PIN number for\nthe ATM machine is.\n\n90\n00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:53.562\n>> And your NIC card.\n\n91\n00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:56.616\n>> And my NIC card [LAUGH].\n\n92\n00:04:56.616 --> 00:05:00.648\nSo 32 or 512 megs of RAM,\n32 gigs of hard drive space, again,\n\n93\n00:05:00.648 --> 00:05:03.160\nget it installed, get everything there.\n\n94\n00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.080\nIt does not allow ATA, PATA, IDE or\n\n95\n00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.698\nenhanced IDE, EIDE, for\nany of my drives really,\n\n96\n00:05:12.698 --> 00:05:17.026\nfor boot, for page or for data drives.\n\n97\n00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:17.664\n>> Doesn't like them.\n\n98\n00:05:17.664 --> 00:05:18.900\n>> Doesn't like them.\n\n99\n00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.430\nSo that technology is finally\nkinda hit the end there.\n\n100\n00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.780\nCan't use that at all.\n\n101\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.540\nNetwork adapter is gonna be needed, at\nleast a gigabit throughput would be nice.\n\n102\n00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.190\nThey say that's a minimum requirement.\n\n103\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.110\nI'm pretty sure even if I had a ten\nmegabit adapter it would probably\n\n104\n00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.160\nlet me install.\n\n105\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.770\nDon't quote me on that,\nI've never tested it or tried it.\n\n106\n00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.729\nBut I don't know that it would actually\nlook at the throughput on your adapter,\n\n107\n00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:42.310\ninteresting.\n\n108\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.058\n>> Yeah, how would it know that?\n\n109\n00:05:43.058 --> 00:05:45.743\n>> They do call it out, so\nfor the exam, remember,\n\n110\n00:05:45.743 --> 00:05:49.557\nMike told you at least a gigabit\nthroughput on your network adapter.\n\n111\n00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:53.382\n>> Maybe they're saying you need to use\na gigabit because you're gonna be running\n\n112\n00:05:53.382 --> 00:05:56.270\nall these services that\nneeds some decent bandwidth.\n\n113\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.666\n>> Yeah, and you will be really hard\npressed to find anything less than\n\n114\n00:05:58.666 --> 00:05:59.473\na gigabyte nowadays.\n\n115\n00:05:59.473 --> 00:06:00.912\n>> Who the heck's running ten megabit?\n\n116\n00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:01.892\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n117\n00:06:01.892 --> 00:06:04.664\nyou can go down to a hardware store or\na swap store and\n\n118\n00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:08.030\nmaybe find a 10/100 card but\nit's gonna be difficult.\n\n119\n00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.470\nAnd then you gotta find a driver for\nit so.\n\n120\n00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.370\nWhat else?\n\n121\n00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.710\nNeed to support\nthe pre-execution environment or\n\n122\n00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.530\npixie boot if we're gonna do any\nnetwork installation of images.\n\n123\n00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.547\nSo requirement-wise, really not that\nsteep, those are minimum requirements.\n\n124\n00:06:22.547 --> 00:06:28.660\n1.4 gigahertz, 512 megs of RAM,\n32 gigs of hard drive space and\n\n125\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.710\na gigabit network adapter\nwill get you started.\n\n126\n00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.690\nThen we've gotta talk about\nthe good old additions.\n\n127\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.650\nAnd there's a few different additions\nas I was saying earlier, but\n\n128\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.270\nit doesn't seem to be quite\nas many as there used to be.\n\n129\n00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.530\nAnd really three mains ones that we'll\nend up dealing with throughout the MCSA\n\n130\n00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.850\ntrack that we have to worry about.\n\n131\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.040\nBut good to know the others just in case.\n\n132\n00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.590\nYou've got the data center version,\n\n133\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.540\nthat's the top dog,\nthe big bad boy of the server world.\n\n134\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.702\nThe data center edition is really designed\nfor highly virtualized environments and\n\n135\n00:07:01.702 --> 00:07:04.912\ndata centers,\nhence the name data center version.\n\n136\n00:07:04.912 --> 00:07:05.597\n>> Who would have thought?\n\n137\n00:07:05.597 --> 00:07:07.950\n>> I know, right?\n\n138\n00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.050\nRemember the license a little\nbit different with data center.\n\n139\n00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.340\nWith data center, you're paying thousands\nof dollars, upwards towards the gosh,\n\n140\n00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.260\nI wanna say 6, $8,000 for\na data center license.\n\n141\n00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.880\nBut you get unlimited virtual\nlicenses when you get that.\n\n142\n00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.720\nSo you get that one physical install and\n\n143\n00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.840\nthen unlimited virtual licenses so,\nthat's why you spend the extra money.\n\n144\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.035\nAnd in a highly virtualized environment,\nthat would make sense.\n\n145\n00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:36.155\nI mean if I'm gonna have 100 virtual\nservers, I can buy one license for\n\n146\n00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.992\n8,000 bucks to cover all of those.\n\n147\n00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:39.940\nYou've gotta work out\nthe math in your environment,\n\n148\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.810\nbut sounds like a good deal to me.\n\n149\n00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.290\nWhat else?\n\n150\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.860\nStandard is the next one\ndown from data center.\n\n151\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.866\nThat one is good for physical\nenvironments, small shops where you\n\n152\n00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:56.241\nactually have physical servers you\ninstall on or a few virtualization.\n\n153\n00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:59.189\nRight, where it's not a heavily\nvirtualized environment, but\n\n154\n00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:02.150\nwe are going to be running\nsome virtual machines.\n\n155\n00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.070\nBecause, with standard,\nyou get one physical install, and\n\n156\n00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.370\nyou get two virtual licenses.\n\n157\n00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.765\nRun you about 800 bucks, 600,\n800 bucks, I think for a standard.\n\n158\n00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:15.385\nAgain, all of these prices, this is as of\nmaybe this morning when we're recording\n\n159\n00:08:15.385 --> 00:08:18.645\nthis, that could very well be\ndifferent by the time you watch this.\n\n160\n00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:20.745\nSo, make sure you go check that out and\ndo your research.\n\n161\n00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:24.325\nThat's not a, prices are not\nan exam type question anyway,\n\n162\n00:08:24.325 --> 00:08:25.605\njust kind of for your information.\n\n163\n00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:30.205\nSo, standard primarily for\nyour physical, minimally virtualized.\n\n164\n00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:34.560\nYou also have an Essentials edition, which\nis kinda like the old small business,\n\n165\n00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.210\nwhere up to 25 users is all you can have,\n\n166\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.950\nI think it's 50 devices\ncan connect into it.\n\n167\n00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.680\nThat's one that you're not gonna find,\nyou'd have to actually, I don't even know\n\n168\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.150\nwhere you get that one, I think you\nhave to go to Microsoft to get that.\n\n169\n00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.310\nThere's also MultiPoint Premium Server for\n\n170\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.820\nvolume license customers\nin academic segments.\n\n171\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.260\nSo, if you're in the academic,\n\n172\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.560\nyou can get a discount on the price for\nMultiPoint Premium Server.\n\n173\n00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.250\nThere's Storage Server, which has\nboth a standard and a work group.\n\n174\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.410\nThose are from the OEM channel only so you\nwould buy an appliance that was running\n\n175\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:14.360\nMicrosoft Storage Server 2016 and\nthen there's also a Hyper V-server,\n\n176\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.450\nwhich is actually a free\ndownload from Microsoft.\n\n177\n00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.690\n>> Hold on now.\n\n178\n00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.070\nI know Microsoft,\nthey don't give anything away for free.\n\n179\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.650\nIs this like their gateway drug to\nget you hooked on their products and\n\n180\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.570\nyou come back for more?\n\n181\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> They'll get you started.\n\n182\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.540\nRight, but now you need something to\nmanage all those Hyper V servers with.\n\n183\n00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.537\n>> So,\nyou're gonna need a system center, and\n\n184\n00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:32.008\nyou're gonna have some\nof that to [CROSSTALK].\n\n185\n00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:32.674\n>> Yeah.\n\n186\n00:09:32.674 --> 00:09:34.190\n[LAUGH] Yeah, buy that system center.\n\n187\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.510\n>> Sure.\nGet your server for free, but\n\n188\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.700\npay $30,000 for a system center.\n\n189\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.460\n>> Exactly.\n\n190\n00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.990\n>> But yeah, there's a hyper version,\nfree download.\n\n191\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.950\nAnd it's just that,\nit's just the hypervisor.\n\n192\n00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.530\nSo if you wanna set up a,\nyou got a core platform hardware,\n\n193\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.450\nyou wanna run Hyper-V on there, you can\ndownload this version and install it.\n\n194\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.820\nAgain, no bells and whistles,\n\n195\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.140\nnone of the rest of the operating system,\njust your hypervisor, but\n\n196\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.790\nmaybe that's all you need, and you can\nmanage it with your normal Hyper-V tools.\n\n197\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.450\nAll right, so, for us really like I said\n\n198\n00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.990\nThree big ones that we'll deal with are\ngonna be data center standard and hyper v.\n\n199\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.460\nThose would be the ones that\nthey might test you on, but\n\n200\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.160\nknow the other ones just in case.\n\n201\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.510\nWe'll be dealing with standard\nas far as demos go and\n\n202\n00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.200\nlabs go we'll be dealing with standard.\n\n203\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.795\nThere isn't a difference\nbetween standard and\n\n204\n00:10:22.795 --> 00:10:25.530\ndatacenter any more,\nI think that started back in 2008.\n\n205\n00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.120\nIn 2003 you had standard and\n\n206\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.900\nenterprise, Enterprise could do\nthings that standard could not.\n\n207\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.470\nLike with Enterprise, you could install\nEnterprise level certificate authority.\n\n208\n00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.980\nOn standard, you couldn't.\n\n209\n00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.400\nWell, that's no longer the case.\n\n210\n00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.640\nWith 2016, all the If features and\nroles are available on both Standard and\n\n211\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.430\nData Center, it's a Licensing\nwhere the differences occurs.\n\n212\n00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.380\nYou don't pay, used to be you have to bump\nup to that Enterprise License just to get\n\n213\n00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.030\nthe ability to do things\nlike Certificate Authority.\n\n214\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.140\nThat's no longer the case,\nyou get a full set with Standard.\n\n215\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.189\nData Center just gives you\nextra licensing capabilities.\n\n216\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.910\nSo the standard data center and\nhyper V are the big ones to know about.\n\n217\n00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:17.480\nWhen it comes to installing our server,\nthat is what we are going to do next.\n\n218\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.260\nWell take a look at the installation and\n\n219\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.140\nnot a lot has changed on\nthe installation for server.\n\n220\n00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.680\nSo if you're familiar with doing\nthis in previous versions,\n\n221\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.900\nyou're well ahead of the game when\nit comes to studying for this.\n\n222\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.150\nWe're gonna go through the process.\n\n223\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.220\nSo what I've go here is I've got\na machine that is booted up, and\n\n224\n00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.130\nit's failed to boot.\n\n225\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.880\nNo operating system is found.\n\n226\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.750\nSo, I've popped a 2016 disk in there, and\nwe're simply going to reboot this machine.\n\n227\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.700\nAnd let it connect to that DVD.\n\n228\n00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.380\nOr ISO in this case since\nit's a virtual machine, and\n\n229\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.880\nwe'll go through the installation process.\n\n230\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.830\nWhen it comes to installing it,\nlike I said, it's a wizard,\n\n231\n00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.260\nit's gonna walk you through it.\n\n232\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.070\nIt's pretty straightforward,\n\n233\n00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.740\nthe main thing is to make sure\nyou met the minimum requirements.\n\n234\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.470\nAnd that you have an idea of what you plan\non doing with that machine, so that if you\n\n235\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.690\nneed more than those minimum requirements,\nyou can Get that taken care of.\n\n236\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.940\nAnd why are you not booting?\n\n237\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.990\nLet's find out here where my mousie went.\n\n238\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.120\nThere it is.\n\n239\n00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.328\nFor some reason my disk is not attached so\nwe'll do that one more More time.\n\n240\n00:12:25.047 --> 00:12:27.190\nAnd it should be right, there it goes.\n\n241\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.480\n>> There we go.\n>> That's a little more like it.\n\n242\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.130\nAnd there's our famous splash screen.\n\n243\n00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:32.816\nWell, not ours.\n\n244\n00:12:32.816 --> 00:12:34.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Microsoft's famous splash\n\n245\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.960\n>> Splash green.\n\n246\n00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.960\n>> Mike drew that himself.\n\n247\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.670\n>> Yes, like the depth perception.\n\n248\n00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.220\n>> That's right.\n\n249\n00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:39.720\nVery cool.\n\n250\n00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.310\n>> Try to make it 3-D for you.\n\n251\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.430\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n252\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.370\nWe get to the first screen,\nwhat are we going to do?\n\n253\n00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.140\nWe're going to install Server 16,\ntechnical preview 5,\n\n254\n00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.640\nthat is the latest version as of\nthe shooting of these episodes.\n\n255\n00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.400\nYou pick your language, your time and\ncurrency, and keyboard or input.\n\n256\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.770\nNotice it's got English and\nUS for all three of those.\n\n257\n00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.430\nThat's because it's detecting that from\n\n258\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.960\nmy Detecting that from my locale.\n\n259\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.470\nWe'll click next and\nwe'll click install now.\n\n260\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.110\nCrazy difficult so far.\n\n261\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.270\n>> Yeah, this is really hard.\n\n262\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:21.170\n>> Yes, no it really is pretty darn\neasy to get this guy installed.\n\n263\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.350\n>> Yeah, it ain't like it used to be.\n\n264\n00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.830\nBack in the day we'd try to\ninstall Windows Server 2000, 2000.\n\n265\n00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.600\nThe junk was a bear,\n\n266\n00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.120\nit was an hour's worth of work just\nto get the server up and running.\n\n267\n00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.790\nAnd then you could start to work.\n\n268\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.670\nYou know, so you had to work so\nthat you work.\n\n269\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.490\nThat stuff's always fun, but\nnow it's basically click, click,\n\n270\n00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.465\nclick And we're up with server.\n\n271\n00:13:41.465 --> 00:13:42.585\n>> Absolutely.\n\n272\n00:13:42.585 --> 00:13:46.595\nThat's right Daniel, they really have\nsimplified the installation process.\n\n273\n00:13:46.595 --> 00:13:47.935\nAnd it's quick as you said.\n\n274\n00:13:47.935 --> 00:13:51.175\nSo, let me get this product key in here,\nMFY9F,\n\n275\n00:13:51.175 --> 00:13:55.990\nand this is a Product key for\nMicrosoft for the trial so\n\n276\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.836\nI'm not calling out my corporations,\nmy company's product key or\n\n277\n00:14:00.836 --> 00:14:05.541\nanything like that.\n\n278\n00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:13.179\nXBN2FTYFMPCCV49RMYVH and\n\n279\n00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:19.010\nwhen I click next, What we should see, is\nit's going to look at the disk, the media,\n\n280\n00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:25.200\nand it's gonna determine whats on that\nmedia, and what that key was for.\n\n281\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.160\nNotice i'm getting standard right here.\n\n282\n00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.420\nIf I've got another key for data center.\n\n283\n00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.490\nIf I would've typed that key in, And\nI could go back and do it right now, but\n\n284\n00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.260\nI don't think you guys wanna watch me\ngo back and type that number again.\n\n285\n00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.680\nAnd then we came to this screen.\n\n286\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.630\nIt would say 2016 Data Center and\nData Center with Desktop Experience.\n\n287\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.230\nSo it reads that key,\nit looks at that key, and it says,\n\n288\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.660\nall right that's gonna unlock\nthese particular versions.\n\n289\n00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.680\nMy point is this particular ISO, and\n\n290\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.100\nseveral of them that you get from\nMicrosoft, will have multiple editions.\n\n291\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.140\nOn the ISO or in the media and\na lot of it's determined by the product\n\n292\n00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.830\nkey that you type in which is gonna\nbe available for your installation.\n\n293\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:02.610\nRight.\n\n294\n00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.150\nSo we are gonna do the good\nold desktop experience first.\n\n295\n00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.590\nI'll click, next.\n\n296\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.980\nNotice that the default was actually,\ncore.\n\n297\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.350\nI'll agree to EULA.\n\n298\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.150\nI'm gonna do a custom install\nbecause there is nothing to upgrade,\n\n299\n00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.820\nthis is a brand new bare metal machine.\n\n300\n00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.490\nI'll use my 60 gigabyte\ndrive that I have available,\n\n301\n00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.940\nthat meets my minimum requirements,\nand the process will start.\n\n302\n00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.220\nHonestly, this will take\nmaybe five minutes.\n\n303\n00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.310\nA lot of it will depend on\nthe performance of your machine,\n\n304\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.330\nbut it really won't take that long.\n\n305\n00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.600\nSo we'll do a quick TV time out.\n\n306\n00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.340\nWe come back we should be up and\nrunning with the server 2016.\n\n307\n00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.230\nAlright there we go, we finished up.\n\n308\n00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.740\nOnce it finishes, this is the screen\nyou come to where you've gotta set your\n\n309\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.730\nadministrative password.\n\n310\n00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.230\nSo I will do that.\n\n311\n00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.139\nSomething complex and long and strong.\n\n312\n00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:48.977\n>> One, two, three, four, five.\n\n313\n00:15:48.977 --> 00:15:49.673\n>> Yeah.\n\n314\n00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:52.181\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's it.\n\n315\n00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:57.379\nLog in With a super secret password and\n\n316\n00:15:57.379 --> 00:16:04.050\nwe now have an installation\nof 2016 server.\n\n317\n00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.168\nNow, it's not configured.\n\n318\n00:16:05.168 --> 00:16:08.970\nI mean we've still got a lot of work to\ndo to get this usable in our network,\n\n319\n00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.990\nin our production environment, but\nwe've got the operating system installed.\n\n320\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.670\nI promise we do.\n\n321\n00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.400\nIt's not just a black screen.\n\n322\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.470\nIt's thinking about it there.\n\n323\n00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.880\nNot the most exciting screen to look at,\nso\n\n324\n00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.245\nmay want to go off that for just a second.\n\n325\n00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:22.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look at Mike's smiling face.\n\n326\n00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.820\n>> Until they come back yeah.\n\n327\n00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.160\nSo we'll wait for that to pop up.\n\n328\n00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.770\nIt's finalizing some settings there.\n\n329\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.320\nAnd actually you know what, while we're\ndoing that, let's flip over to this one.\n\n330\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.120\nAnd this is one where I've\ndone the core install.\n\n331\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.956\n>> It's really not much\nbetter graphically.\n\n332\n00:16:36.956 --> 00:16:38.294\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's not.\n\n333\n00:16:38.294 --> 00:16:42.160\n[LAUGH] Remember core is the installation\nof server that I can do without\n\n334\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.720\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n335\n00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.080\nI wanna leave all that out,\nleave all the wizards out.\n\n336\n00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.120\nStrip all that and\nyou end up with a much smaller,\n\n337\n00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.650\nmuch lighter installation of Server 2016.\n\n338\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.040\nGreat when you're running\na Hyper-V server and\n\n339\n00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.260\nyou want all the resources dedicated to\nthe virtual machine cuz you don't want\n\n340\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.510\nthe host operating system\ntaking up that many resources.\n\n341\n00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.730\nSo any time or if you've got.\n\n342\n00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.160\nI dunno, multiple web servers.\n\n343\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.540\nYou really don't need the graphical\nuser interface on all of them,\n\n344\n00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.320\nyou can manage them remotely.\n\n345\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.610\nSo really core, it is the default,\nit is the preferred way to go.\n\n346\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.210\nIt does take a little bit of getting\nused to to administer it, but\n\n347\n00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.020\nwe do most of our administration remotely,\nanyway.\n\n348\n00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.950\nAnd we'll go through a lot of that\nas we go through these classes.\n\n349\n00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:25.700\nBut I went ahead and\n\n350\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.370\ninstalled it, cuzI wanted to show you the\nstart screen is a little bit different.\n\n351\n00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.070\nWhen it finishes installing,\nI'll zoom in so you can see that there.\n\n352\n00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.500\nIt says the user's password must\nbe changed before signing in.\n\n353\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.950\nLet me center that a little bit.\n\n354\n00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.880\nSo I'll hit enter for okay.\n\n355\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.393\nType in my new password.\n\n356\n00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.640\nI can't type and talk.\n\n357\n00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.780\nPassword has been changed.\n\n358\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.970\nI hit OK.\n\n359\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.560\nI zoom back out and\nthere's my desktop for core.\n\n360\n00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.660\nAnd let's go ahead and\nsay yes for that network.\n\n361\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.340\nAnd I got a couple of\nthings to do on these VMs.\n\n362\n00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.160\nWe just installed them, so I've got\na couple of things to do graphically to\n\n363\n00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.540\nmake it look good on our display.\n\n364\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.870\nBut what we're trying to do is get\nthe operating system installed.\n\n365\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.110\nAnd that we've done.\n\n366\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.640\nSo we've got a desktop edition,\n\n367\n00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.640\nif you will, the one that has\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n368\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.170\nAnd we got one without.\n\n369\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.890\nGetting it installed is mainly knowing\nyour minimum system requirements,\n\n370\n00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.840\nmaking sure that either your physical\nhardware or the virtual machine,\n\n371\n00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.850\nif you're doing it in a virtual,\nmaking sure you assign enough resources\n\n372\n00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:32.970\nto the VM to get that installed to\nrun properly, and there you have it.\n\n373\n00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:33.910\nYou go through the wizard.\n\n374\n00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.670\nReally what did we do?\n\n375\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:39.290\nWe had to put in a product key,\nwe had to agree to the EULA.\n\n376\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:43.380\nWe had to choose to do a custom install\nbecause we weren't upgrading anything, and\n\n377\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.400\nwe chose the drive that\nwe installed it on.\n\n378\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.060\n>> And if you wanted to, you could have\ndone some partitioning if that was\n\n379\n00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.410\nsomething necessary, but other than that,\nreally straight-forward process.\n\n380\n00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.300\nAnd it didn't take but maybe,\nwith Mike explaining it,\n\n381\n00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.830\nI think it was all of ten minutes.\n\n382\n00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.830\n>> Yeah.\n>> Very fast.\n\n383\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.250\n>> Yeah, and the core,\nI'll tell you guys a little secret.\n\n384\n00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.560\nWe did a TV Time Out, as you've seen\nin the video if you're watching this,\n\n385\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.841\nto finish the standard,\nthe desktop install.\n\n386\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.130\nOnce we took the time out,\nI said, well you know what,\n\n387\n00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.490\nthey're not gonna want to see this again.\n\n388\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.020\nI might as well go ahead and\nget core installed up to that same point.\n\n389\n00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.220\n>> It's the exact same process.\n\n390\n00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.610\n>> Yeah, it's the exact same process for\n\n391\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.530\nthe beginning part, just picking\ncore instead of desktop edition.\n\n392\n00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.905\nIt actually finished before\nthe install we took the time out for.\n\n393\n00:19:24.905 --> 00:19:26.345\nIt installed that fast.\n\n394\n00:19:26.345 --> 00:19:31.715\nSo, Server 2016, definitely optimized,\ndefinitely a quick install process.\n\n395\n00:19:31.715 --> 00:19:34.435\nAnd Daniel, I tell you, I know we got\na little time left in this episode, but\n\n396\n00:19:34.435 --> 00:19:36.600\nwe're getting ready to jump\ninto the configuration.\n\n397\n00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.420\nAnd I'm not gonna finish it in\nthe next eight minutes so you wanna-\n\n398\n00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.250\n>> Yeah, no that's perfect.\n\n399\n00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.170\nIt's a great spot.\n\n400\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.450\nThis is the natural stopping spot for us.\n\n401\n00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.620\nThat being said, we're gonna have to,\nwe are gonna make a part two on this,\n\n402\n00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.580\nto go the after effects, right.\n\n403\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.180\nJust because you've got something\ninstalled doesn't mean you don't have to\n\n404\n00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.240\ndo a little more configuration.\n\n405\n00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.800\nWe're gonna do that in part two.\n\n406\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.040\nBut Mike, you're right,\nit's a good spot for us to stop.\n\n407\n00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.910\nLook forward to seeing you in the next\nepisode and figuring this out.\n\n408\n00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.070\nWe look forward to seeing you there\nas well but we're going to sign off.\n\n409\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.310\nITProTV, I've been your\nhost Daniel Lowrie.\n\n410\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.996\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n411\n00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.284\n>> See you next time.\n\n412\n00:20:07.284 --> 00:20:15.680\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
