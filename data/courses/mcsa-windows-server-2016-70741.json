Absolutely, so\n\n7\n00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.700\nit's an exciting conversation we're gonna\nhave around Server 2016 networking.\n\n8\n00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.430\nWe'll be talking about things\nlike implementing DNS,\n\n9\n00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.160\nDHDP, technology called IPAM,\nIP address management.\n\n10\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.840\nHow we integrate that with DHDP and DNS.\n\n11\n00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.680\nTake a look at implementing network\nconnectivity and routing remote access,\n\n12\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.180\nso take a look at remote\ncapabilities there.\n\n13\n00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.890\nTalk about core and distributed networking\nsolutions, software defined networking.\n\n14\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.750\nTake a look at VPNs and\ntunneling and IPv4 and\n\n15\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.680\nIPv6 and all other forums and\nmechanisms of networking, start to finish.\n\n16\n00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.910\nNew, old and current for Server 16.\n\n17\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.390\nWe got some new features, got some\noldies but goodies that come back, and\n\n18\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.420\nsome things that are not necessarily the\nsame way they're been in prior versions.\n\n19\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.830\nAnd we'll talk about those updates and\n\n20\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.270\nhow they affect you as you look to get\nready to take the 7741 exam, right,\n\n21\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.530\ncuz that's gonna be hopefully the goal of\none of the things you wanna do with this.\n\n22\n00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.050\nAnd it's going to give you credit for\nthe Windows Server 2016 MCSA.\n\n23\n00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.010\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff.\n\n24\n00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.770\nNow who would be the audience,\nthe intended audience for this series?\n\n25\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.372\n&gt;&gt; Well, certainly as I just mentioned,\nbut you may want to go out and\n\n26\n00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:32.080\ntake a look at gaming and\ngetting the MCSA credential on Server 16.\n\n27\n00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.920\nSo certainly those people\nthat are pursuing that.\n\n28\n00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.600\nAny IT professional that wants to learn\nmore about networking and prove and\n\n29\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.720\nvalidate those skills can take this exam,\n\n30\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.550\nwhether they're ultimately\npursuing the MCSA or not.\n\n31\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.700\nBut an IT professional, somebody who's\nhands on in the trenches day in,\n\n32\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.070\nday out with server administration\non the Server 16 platform\n\n33\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.820\nwill be a prime candidate for this exam.\n\n34\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.640\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\nNow, you've mentioned the exam a couple of\n\n35\n00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.370\ntimes, maybe you could give us\na couple of details about that.\n\n36\n00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, so the exam, like all\nMicrosoft's exams will be interactive,\n\n37\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.440\nin a sense you have a series of\ndifferent kinds of questions,\n\n38\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.780\ntraditional multiple choice questions,\nscenario based questions,\n\n39\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.490\nthere may be interactive\nquestions of a variety of types.\n\n40\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.720\nYou may have drag and drops for instance.\n\n41\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.190\nYou may have hot spot\nquestions where you have to\n\n42\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.730\nselect something in a console shot or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n43\n00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.070\nHey, what's wrong with this\nparticular console interface.\n\n44\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.500\nClick on the area, you know you\nusually put a little cross-hair or\n\n45\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.230\nsomething like that on the area\nthat you may want to change.\n\n46\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.240\nYou may be asked to go in to\nexamine a diagram of some kind and\n\n47\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.890\ndocument or diagnose a problem\nas a result of what you see.\n\n48\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.070\nThere's a variety of different ways that\nquestions can get asked today, and any or\n\n49\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.180\nall of those could potentially\nshow up on this exam.\n\n50\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.330\nThey do on many other,\nindeed most Microsoft exams these days.\n\n51\n00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Adam thank you for that\nand if that sounds like something that may\n\n52\n00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.977\nbe interesting to you, we look forward\nto seeing you in the upcoming series.\n\n53\n00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:53.707\n[SOUND]\n\n",
